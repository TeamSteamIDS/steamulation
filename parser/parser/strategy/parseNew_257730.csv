								While there may be some big name digital card games on the horizon that you hear people murmering about, it would be unwise to discount Infinty Wars because they are a smaller company. Infinity Wars takes the classic TCG genre that we know and love, and truly digitise it and make full use of the medium. This is not a Magic the Gathering clone that keeps track of the numbers for you. This is not a simple basic TCG built around your favourite MMO mythos. This is an actual strategic masterpiece that requires use of both advanced planning and bluffing mechanics.It is free to play, in the true sense of the word. At no point are you required to spend large amounts of money to get a collection started.  After two hours of the campaign, you should have enough cards to make a deck of any faction, and won a few free boosters along the way.  Meanwhile, you can acrue Infinity Points by playing, which are awarded win or lose.  You can then use these points to buy more boosters or enter the Rift Runs and win more cards! And there is a trading system already in place, so you can trade cards you do not want for those that you do without hoping to open the super mega mythic rare i-win card in a random pack! So while your collection would certianly grow if you spend money on the game, it is not impossible to walk away with a complete playset of everything without spending a cent!The point is, it's different to the other exciting games out there now, and risk-free and worth the look of anyone with even a passing interest in the TCG genre!

								A while ago a friend dropped by and offered me an invite code he randomly collected at a PAX event. Ive been hooked ever since. The little business card with the code advertised the game to me as having amazing animated cards, but it was the level of strategy in the game and unique mechanics which immediately grabbed my attention. Since then I have played ALOT and have still not yet gotten bored because every game is different. The cards and mechanics combo with each other in a way that rewards creative deck building and making bold and creative plays in game.There is always alot of discussion around free to play and pay to win and everyone has their own perspective. I believe that this game is one of the more truely free to play games out there. This is for two good reasons...- First, I have built a full collection as well as pre-ordered many packs for the upcoming expansion and given away many cards including rares all while being almost entirely free to play. (I did purchase some alternate card backs/sleeves)- Second, certain cards are powerful and rare but extremely powerful decks are able to be built without any 'valuable' cards at all. The emphasis on player skill and in-game decisions means that this game could never be pay to win.I would recommend this game to anyone interested in trading card games and would advise playing before comparing to other games like MTG and Hearthstone because Infinity Wars has many unique features and I believe a bright future!

												This game is probably the least pay to win card game I've ever played. It's just overall really really good and it's still expanding to be even better. Play this game!			"

												The best online deckbuilding game there is, if you ask me. Lots of interesting cards, various rather original factions with their own strategies and nicely animated cards. (EVERY CARD IS ANIMATED!) As for the free2play - well I never spent a dime on it and still had a lot of fun. You earn a decent amout of ingame currency just through the campaign, challenges and just normal games. Plus you get free cards and booster packs for wins and for levelups. It certainly could be better - but compared to basically every other online CCG on the market it's pretty good.			"

												If you want the short version, skip to the bottom.The game is relatively fast-paced due to utilizing a simultaneous turns mechanic, with both players completing their actions at once.  This establishes a very engaging experience in which both players have to try and guess at what the opponent will do, and how to respond.  The game also allows for a great deal of strategy, utilizing both a ""health"" system akin to Magic or other TCGs, as well as a morale system (which effectively functions as a second health meter, except it drops from losing troops in battle), multiple combat zones, and an initiative system.  There is definitely plenty of depth to be had in this game.The game is also very good about rewarding every portion of your progress.  There is a leveling system which gives you free cards when you level up, and you also get free cards from completing various achievements (termed ""quests"" in your profile window) such as beating the AI in training matches multiple times, completing the (very short) campaigns for each faction, and beating Academy challenges.  And the game even allows you to construct your own decks for facing off against players or AIs.So why am I not recommending this game?  Well, I should be honest.  This is perhaps one of the first times I'm actually NOT recommending a game, it's simply not something I do often.  So I want to be perfectly clear: this game is fun, but there ultimately is one MAJOR flaw with its design structure.No, before you say it, it's not that the game is Pay To Win.  On many occasions I actually beat players using mostly starter-level cards.  And some players have done quite a lot with their starter cards and worked hard to become top players.  But with that said, the community needs to be more honest with itself: newer, free players are definitely at an inherent disadvantage compared to players who have spent lots of time and/or money on the game.I'll try to explain, since that sounds like it may contradict what I said before.  Again, I'm not bashing the game, and it does make some effort to give you lots of cards to play around with.  But it's not nearly enough.In my experience, completing every single campaign mission and PvE fight possible only leveled me to just below Lvl 9 (there are 50 levels).  So it's relatively clear the game is trying to encourage you to face other players.  I had no problem with this, so I started playing some matches against other people.  But I quickly began to realize there was a problem: they had WAY better decks than I did, filled with cards that were in many ways significantly better than mine....and I had no way to prevent them from beating me into the dirt, no matter how well I understood the game or how well I played.I can recall several matches in which I played my deck's strategy out perfectly, and even outplayed my opponent for the majority of the game, only to fall behind and eventually lose because they kept pulling out cards that I'd never seen before, cards I had no access to, and cards that I had no defense against.  And yes, I can tell the difference.  I played several folks who were just a lot better than me....but also a number of people who clearly were not, who ended up beating me anyways because their deck was full of cards I couldn't combat.I recall one particularly egregious match where my opponent was being repeatedly outplayed card for card.  Every time he made a move, I was predicting and countering it.  I got him down to a mere 5 HP, while I still had 86, and I had multiple creatures in play with Flying (he had nothing that could block Flying).  So imagine my surprise when he started employing cards that I'd never seen before, turned the match around within a few turns, and ultimately won.  Not because he was ""better"", mind you, but because he was using cards that I had never seen and had absolutely no hard counter for amongst all of the starter and booster cards I'd received from PvE content to that point.I made an honest effort at the Rift system, too, but ultimately it's got that same problem, but worse, because the players in that mode are clearly superior to the ones in normal queue matches.  The gap between a newbie and a veteran is simply too great to overcome, even if you get pretty good at the game relatively quickly as I did.Now, let me return to a previous point: the PvE content only gets you to around Lvl 8 or 9, which doesn't yield you nearly as large of a selection as you'd think in terms of cards to build your decks with.  And to make matters worse, while the game does allow you to buy booster packs for free (using an in-game currency obtained during matches), the booster packs are prohibitively expensive.  15 cards costs over 5k points....and running all of the PvE content in the entire game only netted me about 5.5k or so, and losing a PvP match nets you less than 100 points per match.  So in order to gain enough points to buy a 15-card booster pack, you have to effectively run over 50 regular PvP matches.  Which is by no means reasonable.I've seen former and current players who even admit to this being a major issue with the game, so I know I'm not imagining it.  One particular testimony came from someone who (at the time) was a Top 10 player.  He admitted that he got there by spending lots of real money to build a good deck, and after that, he was beating people right and left.SUMMARY: No, the game isn't technically P2W.  You can earn cards for free if you have the patience.  But if you purchase cards with real money, you are saving yourself countless hours of grinding, and you ultimately WILL perform much better than you would have if you'd tried to play with just the freebie cards that the game gives you.  No amount of personal skill or TCG experience can overcome the significant gap in deck strength between a veteran and a new player.You will either pay for better cards, or you will have to grit your teeth and lose a *lot* of matches in order to earn them for free.  I chose the third road: After several matches against opponents that I should have beaten, but instead lost to, I finally gave in to my frustration, closed the game, and uninstalled it.  The core game is a lot of fun, but it's mired in the ""grind"" of obtaining new cards and the game's significant balancing issues.  If the above stated issues are resolved at some future point, I might be persuaded to return at that time.  For now, it's a no-go for me.EDIT (Nov 4): The game is effectively dead at this point.  The devs are still trying to update the game to the best of my knowledge, but the player base has declined dramatically since I first posted this review.  There are very few people still playing this game at this point, meaning your queues will be longer and you'll be seeing the same opponents even more often than I was back in January when I wrote this review.  At this point, you're better off investing your time and money into one of the card games that's still going strong, like Hearthstone, than spending it here.It's a shame, too, as I had hoped the game would turn itself around and I might be able to reverse this review one day.  But it seems they never did, or at least, they never improved enough that they felt compelled to try and bring people back.  So I'm pretty much calling this review finished, and I likely won't update it any more beyond this point.			"

												To give a little perspective on my opinion, here's a quick brief on me.  I come from a game design background, having gone to an art school for it.  I played TCGs heavily for a period and followed competitive play of friends, which led to a big interest of card game R&D.  I also had a half decade of national-level competitive fighting game play that defined my love for the mental aspect of any competitive game.  With those things in mind, I love games that introduce new concepts into a genre and take great care in implementing them well.  To my great pleasure, this is exactly what Infinity Wars has accomplished.Taking full advantage of the digital format of the game, Infinity Wars has incorporated a few huge advantages over the average card game:1. Simultaneous turns.2. Deck commanders.3. Animated card art.4. A non-exploitative Free-To-Play business model.-1-Simultaneous turns is my personal favorite addition into the genre that really makes a massive change in the dynamics of a turn.  It serves two major purposes.  First, it reduces down time while waiting for your opponent to play through their turn, which keeps both players a lot more active while playing and speeds up games to a degree.  Second, it enforces a major element of prediction over reaction.  What your opponent may play and how you want to play spells or move/rearrange your creatures is always an important part of the flow of battle and ultimately who wins.  In addition, there is an initiative that swaps between players each turn that allows one player's spells and attacks to resolve first.  Simply put, this one feature puts Infinity Wars on a completely new level compared to all other card games, and I absolutely love it.-2-Commanders also serve two important purposes.  First, the faction of each commander determines what cards you're able to place within that deck.  Having 3 different factions in command gives you a lot of options, whereas three of the same faction gives you access to all tiers of cards within that faction.  Second, the commanders are simply extra playable cards from the same list of cards you would build the deck from, yet they exist outside of the limitations of the deck.  For example, setting up a deck with commanders that cost 1, 2, and 4 cost cards, when you know your deck has a majority of 3 cost cards gives you a huge advantage in the reliability of your first few turns.  It would allow you to simply play your command creatures if you didn't have anything better in your hand, helping to you overcome the inherent randomness of card games.  Command creatures also count as being in play, allowing you to use character abilities from the command zone, yet also being slightly at risk to creature removal in the process.  Interestingly, the command setup often broadcasts what to expect from the opponent, so that both players understand what they're roughly up against.  It's simply a wonderful concept all around.-3-A major marketing point for the game itself is the animated card art.  Now, having come from an art school, I can tell you that a lot of the early card animations were very rough.  Flash-esque element manipulation, simple things like colors glowing in and out, etc.  With each consecutive set, though, the quality of art and animation has simply skyrocketed.  The next set's card previews left me in awe and craving more.  And despite a tremendous amount of time and effort going into each card's art, they don't skimp on the amount of content that each set delivers.  That, to me, is truly impressive, especially considering the they're such a small team.-4-And finally we reach their business model.  Now, I have to admit I really dislike what the free to play model has become in the current gaming climate.  It often encourages a lot of exploitation of the player, detracting from their fun as much as possible without actively pushing away players, in order to influence addictive spending.  Much to my relief, Lightmare has not only eliminated the biggest pitfalls of free to play design (the pay-to-win stuff), but also actively rewards free players by allowing cards purchased with the in-game currency to be tradeable with others.  They also have a rudimentary master and apprentice system that rewards both players with free cards for playing together.  It even incorporates a very rewarding draft mode that allows players who manage good runs to get high rarity free cards and even potentially receive their whole draft deck for free.The only reason the game doesn't receive a 10/10 is that the game is still fairly new, and has a number of planned updates that are absolutely necessary to eliminate a lot of bugs, open it to more playable platforms, and expand on the overall longevity of the game.  As those are incorporated, I can confidently say that the game will grow to be be the best possible card game I can imagine.Thanks for reading along, and I hope you join us all in the wonderful experience it offers.

								This is absolutely my favorite dTCG in the market.  Both the strategic layer of deck building and the tactical layer on the battleground have new and unparalleled mechanics.  The F2P model is fair and unobtrusive and you can legitimiately be a competetive player with zero-to-minimal investment, or spend some cash to enhance your card collection.  I admit to being incredibly biased as I have streamed the game nightly for more than 3 months, but if it wasn't fun and deep I don't think it could have possibly held my interest.  I whole-heartedly reccomend this game to anyone who has an interest in TCGs or computer strategy games.  At the price of 'Free' you can't possibly be dissapointed!			"

								THE best new cardgame. I love the graphics and the strategy is endless. In addition, the community is awesome and always ready to help others.Edit: Many people ask how this game compares to Hearthstone. While they are both digital card games, Infinity Wars couldn't be more different. HS is targeted at a casual audience and is fairly simplistic. IW is targeted at tcg players and is much more customizable. I would think of this more in terms of the next generation of MTG. Give Infinity Wars a try, I'm sure you'll like it.			"

												I want to like this game -so- much. I love card games, and this one has a great thing going on. Business model with a lot of good things about it, interesting factions and playstyles, a surprising level of depth without being too complex, the game has an incredible amount of potential.If they would just fix the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking.When the -very- first pvp match you ever play is vs a guy at level 50 with freaking glowing icons all across his profile, something is -wrong- with the system. But, initially, I wasn't discouraged. I thought to myself 'Well, it is kind of late at night. Maybe they just have it set so that if there aren't enough players in whatever tier it begins to strech or whatever'. So, I wait till the next day.Five games. In a row. Exact. ♥♥♥♥ing. Same. Thing. I managed to get one with someone relatively on my level. I lost that one, but it was -fun- unlike the others.But that was one out of -six-, and further games only matched that ratio. Now, I am very much discouraged. I don't know if I can work up the will to slam my head against pointless losses for weeks on end untill I get the cards and skills to match up.I can't imagine I am alone either. If this isn't fixed, then the game will be doomed to a stagnent playerbase, and eventually death. A FTP game without a steady influx of new players looking at the shiny things you can buy is a -doomed- one.			"

												I'm far too lazy to write long & tedious reviews so i'll keep this short & sweet._________________________________________________This is a card game that ACTUALLY feels like a real card game. If you played Magic the Gathering & have been looking for an alternative, this may be what you were searching for. -First & foremost, the cash shop: all card packs can be bought with in game currency or money, the only thing that can only be bought with money is purely cosmetic. You get a free card every day & another for winning every day & they can be of any rarity (from what i've seen). Basically you can play the game without paying globs of $.-I'm not going to go in depth of it's mechanics because 1. it's free you can play it yourself, 2. I'm lazy & 3. I suck at explaining mechanics & strategy, just know that it's fun.-Graphics I guess? I mean it's a TCG but people expect mind blowing graphics sometimes. It's beautiful, the cards are all animated and the battlefield is in 3D. Also the game runs really well.There's not really much else to say, I enjoyed it enough to write something about it & since it's out of Early Access (whoa that never happens).APPEND: If your going to compare this to Hearthstone, don't. If your going to have a comparison, most would say Hearthstone is casual & this would be more towards... not casual, but that's just a bad way to compare things.______________________________________________________________UPDATE: After a really long time I've decided to come back and check on the game. Development and updates seem to be going in a positive direction with new interface improvements and new cards, however I could not seem to find a normal match no matter how long I reasonably waited. That was the main I left a long time ago as I simply couldn't find games in a few seconds like when the game first launched. Maybe everyone moved onto other game modes I'm not sure. Staring at the cards is still fun as always, pretty nostalgic seeing all my old decks.			"

Posted: April 25, 2015
												Infinity Wars seemed like it was going to be a spectacular game. Now, it is like almost all other free to play games in almost all respects—you have to pay to play and it’s full of promises that are never delivered. I have sunk a considerable amount of time in this game and have heard and read a lot about debated topics and other babble from the developers, so this short review has a good foundation. To start, I will list the cons, which dwarf all pros in such a way, now, that it’s hard to even fathom why I got hooked on this game in the first place. There are very few events that would equate to something like a double xp weekend in most games. When I say few, I really just mean one major one, which they called golden ticket weekend/ week. This only happened once some time last year—mind you, I have been playing this game off and on for almost two years. Also, from what I have heard, there may have been an increased IP (game currency) weekend once or twice since its inception, but I didn’t even notice it because the bonus was so small. Having something like double IP weekends or more golden ticket weekends would give the game a bit of an edge because you would have something to look forward to. I must say though, at the start, it seems you do have things to look forward to. For instance, I used to look forward to getting a free pack of cards when I leveled up. However, when you reach level 40 or 50, the free packs stop, and you get to level 40 or 50 in this game pretty quickly. That all said, even if they started to put more bonus IP weekends and the like in the game, it still wouldn’t be enough to make it a worthwhile game.Additionally, there are several bugs, and they are extremely annoying ones that have been around since the start of the game. The most annoying one to me is trying to actually trade a card with someone. If you are able to get a trade session going on the first try, consider yourself lucky. For me, trading is the most important aspect of a “trading card game”. If you complain to devs about it, they will say, “We will be getting new servers soon.” But their definition of soon is going on years and is probably really never. Another bug(s) is that there are a number of card glitches that have been around since its inception that really affect gameplay dramatically. For instance, my favorite card ""Tome of the Dead"" (a fairly powerful card for the sleeper faction) often times freezes the current match when its ability procs. Also, on top of this, they frequently make ninja changes to various cards and, also, take them out of play with no warning. Like right now, a few cards have been “temporarily” disabled for the past two months because they are supposedly not working as intended. The few expansions they have had for the game has done very little for actual gameplay. If anything, it has gotten worse with each expansion. The same cards continue to be way superior to others, they don’t think about trying to make weak cards stronger (and more desired) with the additional cards and their effects, and their way of trying to balance the game for each expansion is nerfing the heck out of cards that you have more than likely paid good, real money for. For instance, if you are at all familiar with the game, Demon of Fear and Shikana were once great cards but now are pretty much obsolete with most deck builds. Yes, some changes are expected, but many changes and drastic ones, like these, should not happen, especially with a pay to play game. This approach, ultimately, has ruined all metagame and made the game quite boring. Basically, you are stuck with only a few deck builds that are viable for ranked play.They have been selling the same premade decks of cards since day one. Therefore, all cards in those decks have pretty much no value. Anyone who buys those decks are really wasting their money. On top of that, they arbitrary rotate each deck to be on sale, which is extremely annoying to me for some reason. Why don’t they offer a small pack of random foil or gold cards of a certain faction (or of all factions) or even arbitrarily create small packs that have a higher chance of having a certain rare card? They also have the same cheesy avatars, card backs, and battlegrounds since day one. It’s aggravating because I know they could throw in a 1000 avatars in the game easily. They could also up the avatar rewards.Weekly quests are a joke. They can be completed in an hour. These quests used to, at least, give out foil cards if you completed them. Now, I know they don’t give foil cards like they used to anymore, and I don’t even think weekly quests even work currently. I’d have to check.No one wants to trade. This is because, for instance, one gold foil aleta card is worth more than 200 regular rare, epic, and/ or most legendary cards combined. So, being dead honest, trading is obsolete by the time you hit level 20. Once you have the cards for a deck you want, which is pretty easy to do, the next step is getting those pretty, shiny cards. Though, there are only two ways to do this: you can either buy them with real money on some illegitimate site through PayPal (or through eBay ) for a crap ton of money, or you can swindle newbs as they are trying to build their deck (this is way harder to do, however). I once tried getting a particular card this way and I literally spent two months in trade chat looking for a particualr gold-foil rare card and, finally, gave up because I was unable to even find someone who even had it. What is disturbing, however, is that the devs seem to promote this behavior by letting players advertise and auction off cards on their website forums. As dubious as this may sound, I truly believe devs withhold cards in game so they could sell them on their forums for outrageous prices through some alias.Players say that you may find gold-foil cards, which are the most rare kind of cards other than platinum-foil cards in preorder packs, in packs of cards or doing rift runs, but I have bought well over 500 packs of cards with real currency and (mostly) ingame currency and played countless rifts since the game has released and have yet to see one in any pack or for any reward. So if you are wanting to try this game out for the trading aspect of this “trading card game” keeping in mind the dificulty and the severe rarity of decent cards that card collectors would want, don’t unless you are willing to dish out some serious cash and put up with the numberous bugs.Moreover, this game still lacks player base, and it is due to the issues I have brought up so far.There are several other issues with this game, such as their idea of adding new factions while dropping old ones. However, right now, I don’t even think this game is worth writing a good review for…even a bad one. Anyway, I’ll come back to edit this at a later time perhaps. (update 9/9/2015: most problems still exist and more have been added. If the game ever gets better, I will change the state of this review.)Update 11/15/2015: The game is still in a state of decay, and Devs have completely abandoned the game--will update if they decide to return.

												GAME IS UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT! So yeah, earlier this year the game was given a new publisher and they've been doing great! In fact, 2 days till the ""Reborn"" overhaul. Next month is new set of cards. Better rewards and an easier way to earn cards, not to mention the game finally runs smoothly. Seems the game is finally back on track. Check out their forums for more details on all the updates. Basically it rose from the dead. So yeah, I'll support it.			"

												What's so great about Infinity Wars?1. It has simultaneous turns (which means, you and your opponent decide at the same time what to do, so it has much more pace than eg. MTG DOTP and triggers many more mind games)2. It has different zones of play: - Command (where you put the cards you build your deck around, also they define the pool of cards you can include in your deck) - Support (where your creatures you just played are placed due to summoning sickness, you can also pull already in play creatures back to it in order to dodge spells affecting ATK and/or DEF zone) - Attack and Defense (The two players decide at the same time, if they want to attack OR defend)3. It has different modes: - Infinite (you can play every card that has ever been ""printed"") - Ranked (it takes a while to be playable for a beginner, you play a best-of-three with a sideboard to get a better rank that provides special cards at the end of each season, also some cards are restricted)- Pauper (every card BELOW rare is allowed [there are common, uncommon, rare, epic and legendary])- Draft (you pick one out of four cards 40 times [plus the command zone picks], it's not really recommendable for a start but incredible fun if you know the pool a bit)4. Each day you get a reward for logging in and for playing three games (those can be common cards up to legendaries, it can be any card in game)5. Every card is obtainable without spending any real money6. The cards are like GIFs, with nice artwork and all do have an animation to admire7. The new campaign mode provides many essential cards for further deck building for free just for crushing bots8. It has a win option that eg MTG does not have: reducing the so-called Morale of the opponent. It has 100 points, just like the ""normal"" health bar and can be reduced by killing enemy creatures. 9. Last but not least: the community is just great. I've played more than 1000 matches and i was insulted ONCE, true story. Also the Lightmare Forums are really recommended here, where people can exchange about eg. deck building, certain card mechanics and also are able to have direct contact with the Lightmare Staff, who always answer every single (yeah really) question [thx Teremus btw].So.. What's actually bad about IW?1. Cards obtained from Log In Reward or LVL UP boosters are not tradable. Only the ones you bought with IP (you also gain them by just playing fortunately) and the ones you won in draft. There is no forging system or else [yet].2. There are some bugs sometimes, that can make one really angry tbh. But the LM staff is quite aware of those and does bug fixes regularly.3. Cards you do not own yet are not displayed. 4. It can take some time to gain a booster from IP in the beginning.5. The saddest point: the community is not that big yet. Though I'm quite sure the community will become bigger, because the game is just awesome and one can see the effort Lightmare puts into it.Finally I have to say: for people who don't play TCGs usually: give it a try at least. It's obv the most exciting and challenging TCG there is atm (admittedly I never played Hex).For people playing MTG/HS or else: this game has a unique playstyle, it's more modern than MTG (you don't depend on drawing islands), it's more challenging than HS: join the community already, what are you waiting for? :D			"

												So being a veteran of modern and older TCGs and seeing this was the only one such with positive reviews on Steam I would like to give it a try. Long review ahead. Most people view reviews to see if the game is worth their time so I will give my opinion on that.To begin, first and foremost about game optimization. You are required to make an account on the game's platform, which can be done through the main menu quickly without need to confirm or verify or anything such. Aside that the game crashed once while I was playing it after 6 hours, but reconnect was instant and I didn't lose anything. It also crashed when I hit the quit button but it quitted normally in some seconds. Noteworthy I really like the artwork of the game. Every card is basically a good quality gif of anything from primeval creatures to alien demon entities in a serious anime style(actually very close to Attack on Titan animation if you ask me) which I personally like.Secondary and most important, if you have experience with other TCG games you will probably like this as it combines many interesting features and comes out as an innovative title. It may be weird, unbalanced, easy to lose track but these qualities apply to most leading TCGs currently(YGO/MTG etc) as long as you are not familiar with them. To give some insight into the gameplay, without analyzing the strategies or the cards(yet):You have a deck of 40 cards(by default) of creatures and abilities, the creatures have a mana cost, attack and defense values, and their own effects, while abilities sport their own mana cost for their effect. By default the mana progresses simply like hearthstone. Disclaimer: I am pretty sure that it's not called mana in the game but just Resource but it is easier for me to type it and reference it this way.So every player starts at 1 mana(resource-bah) and they get 1 per turn capping at 10 to play their cards with. The creatures funtcion like Hearthstone as well, as in their health does not regenerate after combat and any changes to their stats usually remain put if increased by an effect. Worth noting that killing a creature that boosts the health of others can result to the death of other creatures(as in MTG) something that does not happen in Hearthstone. So this seems pretty basic but the core gameplay is where it takes a twist.Every player has 4 zones, the Support Zone, the Assault Zone, the Defense Zone and the Command Zone(if I get any name wrong plz don't flay me). When you ""play"" a creature it appears in your Support Zone, acts as if it has entered the battlefield and is subject to effects of your and enemy creatures(but not spells yet). It cannot swap zone at the same turn. On your turn you can indefinitely move creatures from your Support Zone to either the Defense or the Assault Zone(you can also indefinitely swap them). When you have done so and played any spells if any both players click ready and each player's Assault Zone tries to beat the other player's Defense Zone, in a fashion of the leftmost card attacks first.You can change the row in which your creatures attack which is very important in the game. A tricky part is that abilities constantly update. If my 4/4 that gets +2/+2 when an enemy dies kills the enemy's attacking 2/2, its ability procs and it becomes a 6/4 evidently tanking an infinite amount of 2/2s. And such abilities exist in abundance in the game.A versatile part is you can retreat everything you have back to the Support Zone again indefinitely. There is no limit to how you move stuff you have already summoned so if you suspect your enemy is about to bomb you you can massive retreat and such. Many cards heal/boost the ones adjacent to them every turn and keeping these in Support Zone is the ideal way to activate their effects. The last and most interesting zone is the Command Zone. Kinda familiar with how commanders work in MtG, from your deck you pick 3 cards to put in your Command Zone. Any cards. They are not subject to targeting abilities but they are subject to area of effect spells(boosts or damages), their passive/active abilities can trigger and if you pay their cost you can instantly put them in your Assault or Defense Zone. The possibilities with that are endless. The winning condition is, two winning conditions by default which has never been done in TCGs I have seen before. By that I mean that every player has 2 bars not one, Health and Morale. Health is the damage when you get attacks while undefended(or when enemies slip past your defenses) and Health is 100/100 when most creatures start with attacks between 4-8, however that does not make the games longer as pretty much anything ends up boosting itself. Morale is again a 100/100 bar. Every creature has a morale cost, which is how much morale you lose if the creature dies. If your Morale or Health drop to 0 or less, you are ded. Since combat happens at the same time for both players however it's very easy to do draws, with both players putting nothing on defense and going for the face.The campaign(8 missions per each of the 8 game factions, makes sure you reach Level 7(You can play online after 4 and Ranked after 10), and it also makes sure you get the basic cards of every faction, try some premade decks while at it and get some extra packs of pre determined cards and 1 random booster per level. Speaking about the campaign here is a faction overview:-The Red Dawn Army(Red Colour) a lighter version of Warhammer's space marines that try to blitz their enemies out or boost their own stats for quick attacks.-The Genesis Industries(Blue Colour) a faction utilising Droids that boost each other and Artifacts that have good active abilities while they stay in your Support or Command Zones.-The Warpath(Green Colour) the big huge bulky high mana cost trampling creatures(nothing impressive but their art is very nice and cute).-The Awakened of Avarrach(Yellow Colour) a horde of robot zombies that focuses on its creatures constantly dying which boosts everything else they have and/or killing enemy creatures with effects that transport them to your Support Zone rather than the enemy's graveyard.-The Verore Cult(Purple Colour) your everyday evil wizard researchers that bomb the enemy creatures with spells while their own creatures grow stronger the more spells you cast sitting in their Support Zones.-The Exiles(Pink Colour) literally a faction that references Warhammer again being what you would expect from Tzeentch's demons. They focus on Exile X keyword which means if you discard a card and then pay X something happens(usually that card coming back as a stronger demon tentacle abomination).-The Dragon Descendants(Teal Colour) are a gimmicky monk like race with cool animations that remind the Avatar series that focus on defending and healing to destroy your enemy's Morale.-The Overseers(White Colour) my favorite faction*reasons* that consist of anime-like busty angels with blazing halos and pistols outfitted in tight swimsuits(there are also some unsettling male cards) and well, just every single gif from this faction's collection is epic on its own specific way. Their specialty is death from above.For those who just want to check this out, play the campaign and explore the innovation, I definitely recommend it. If you are experienced with TCGs you will like it or at least give it credit for being brave to do stuff like that, if you are not into TCGs I am sure you will find it confusing but the Tutorial is there and every card explains what its ability keyword means the first time you look at it. The story has some considerable plot as well!Very Recommended(7.7/10)			"

												Ah, Infinity Wars. Right off the bat, it's a good game. As you get more cards, though, it just gets better.The art is good, the gameplay is balanced, it isn't Pay to Win, the devteam listens, and the range of cards is beautiful.What more do you want?			"

Early Access Review
								For a free card game, this one's pretty cool.I just totally dig the animated cards. It's something most digital card games could have, but only few actually seem to do. heh, and effects like having cards with flying ability float... it really breathes that extra bit of life into those card games.As for the game itself, it's pretty straightforward. There was this youtube tutorial... but I totally skipped it. I'm not fond of video tutorials, rather have a written guide. But neither was necessary, it just takes a few rounds and a test build deck to figure out how things work. There's also a few tutorial matches you can play to learn the ropes.Gameplay;This is a multifaction cardgame; meaning that, much like MtG with their different elements, this game has different factions. And ofcourse each has their own way. The way you choose your factions is by giving creatures of that faction a commander position. This allows them to be on the table and use abilities, but they're not directly on the battlefield. Some cards seem to need more than one commander and only a max of 3 commanders allowed, so for the really powerful stuff you'll need to choose.Resources on the other hand are automatically added; rather than needing resource cards, you get incremental RP each turn in the game. The ""battlefield"" consists of a commander field, support field, and combat zones (defense/offense).You can freely move your creatures around each turn, even their attack order can be sorted. Support field is where you can place creatures outside combat, it's also where most creature cards start.Player turns go in 2 sections; preparation and turn resolve. Basically, each player prepares a set of moves, and then that turn is set into motion. Rather than turn based and being able to interrupt the other players' turn to use instant abilities, they have to be prepared up front. This does make it harder than waiting for the right card, you also need to be sure your target will become or will stay available when you aim for them.Apart from PvP, there's also a campaign available. It's best to start off there with the first few levels of each campaign, as you get a starter pack from each one. -I haven't been playing much yet, so I can't say much about the balancing issues some people have been talking about. Either way, as this is still a beta, I'm sure eventually the whole set will get balanced eventually.All'n all, it's been pretty good so far.			"

												After playing Hearthstone and Solforge before, I did become rather bored of them.Hearthstone sure is fun if u want to play a  quick game with friends and its very polished  and i love the Warcraft Universe from Wacraft 3 and Wow anyway. But after that it becomes rather boring because it hasnt got much depth. Most of the times there is only one play which makes sense. So it becomes rather dull after some games. Solforge was fun, but after the release of new Cards (looking at you duskmaw,Bramblewoodtracker,Rage and Broodqueen)I started to dislike it.Well to get to the Point. i saw an Trailer about Infinty Wars and got interested and started playing it.After nearly 2 week now im doing a little resume of what i experienced.Good Things:- A Campaign which tells you a bit about the lore of infinty wars and how the game work in generally. Completing the campaign grants cards for each faction. These freely granted cards are competive and are a foundation for every deck.- Legendary cards have the same power level as Common or Uncommon Cards. Legendarys are often more flashy or highly expensive lategame cards. But are not clearly better versions of an common or uncommon.- You have many options in every turn. thinking about 1 or 2 minutes for planing a turn is pretty normal.-Cards have an Animation.-Nice Background Music-Skill is a huge factor in the game. Both players plan on the same time, then their action resolve at the same time.Which means you must guess what your opponent is up to.-has an Draft Mode (Called Rift run). Which allows you to Construct an Deck from Random Cards. Same Chances for everyone. The entry fee of an Rift runs seems fair. -A Trading system, You can trade every card which you did get from boosters or which you did win in an Rift Run.You dont have to pay in real money for it. Cards in ingame currency are also tradeable.-No Pay to Win. Everything is accessible  with ingame currency and Real Money-Free  Cards for logging in , leveling up, and playing 3 games each day.-An Ingame Ladder for Ranked games-Ranked Games are best of 3-In Ranked Games you have an sideboard. This means countering popular decks is possible. This also means its less likely to just have one dominant deckBad Things-If you have many units on the field targetting gets rather complicated.-You cant see cards which you dont own. So you must rely on other sources on the web to see cards you dont own-Some small bugs and wording errors.-There is no Gamelog.  So cant resume and analyse a game afterwards. -Some Animation could look better. Like when all characters attack for example-Would be cool if some of the unique cards had some special sounds when summoning them. (Like in Hearthstone)  So when you summon that big scary Demon Lord , there should be some kind of Sound effect.Or if u change the Location of the Battfield the Background soundtrack should change.   Summary: The graphic and sounds of Infinty Wars are good, but Hearthstone shows that there is still some room to                   improve in that regard. Gameplay wise on the other side its the best Card Game i played so far.                                "

												Game used to be good but the recent patches have made the game so horribly unbalanced that it's laughable. Get used to fighting with and against the same 3 factions again and again because the rest are not even viable anymore 80% of the time. The dev's warped idea of card rotations is give the same 4 factions over 10 new cards every expansion and give the other factions maybe 4 if you are lucky, or if you are really unlucky like sleeper players then just 1 new card that is kind of ""meh"" in comparison. Instead of killing off the faction and the end of the rotation block like they should do, they instead kill off the older factions early by denying them any new cards save for maybe a pitiful amount which creates a power vaccum where 2-3 factions litterally have no reasonable counters to them.  As of this moment sleepers and exiles have a rediculously low amount of cards whereas warpath and genesis has almost triple the amount of cards than any other factions making them versitile for amost any situation, especially when the new cards they recieve every new expansion usually ends up outclassing the older cards. If they address the balance issues I would gladly give the game a positive, until then you're probably better off looking for a different card game.			"

												With the new reward system, giving you a pack of 15 cards every 5 days.  option to play pauper(no rares or higher), plenty of poiints and cards given out, the spectacular art and lore, and deep, deep gameplay. I am totally on board with this game. Awesome stuff. Uninstalled hearthstone and Mtgedit, the new reward system has you now (in a 5 day period) get 12 card )3 of them rares or better) and a ip/exp boost lasting 72 hrs Tornys with prizes every week (including pauper) and fixed deck mode comming in with rebirth patch. this game is totally worth your time			"

												Highly recommend as this game is great.  It does have a tougher learning curve than Hearthstone, but once you understand the basics, get familiar with the cards and the factions, it's awesome. Should I attack, block, stay back? Bluff? Is he going to move that card to the attack zone now so my removal will work?  Can't get to his fortress? That's ok because I'll destroy all your characters and win by killing your morale.  So much going on.  And it's not pay-to-win, at least not at lower/middle levels.  You do need to put together a card collection, but I'm having no trouble doing so just by leveling up, quests and daily log-in bonuses.  And then putting together different decks and trying them out is a blast. Lots of combinations.  And if you don't have a deck you like, they offer weekly decks you can use to compete with that are strong. (Sometimes TOO strong, those endless sleeper decks can be annoying to play against.) The art and animations of the cards is a nice bonus too. And so far, the community has been nothing but nice. Haven't run into a troll yet. I do recommend starting by spending time going through the campaign and academy challenges. The story of the campaign isn't special, but it's a necessary tutorial.  Playing bots and friends earns you xp and infinity points as well, so you're not forced to just play random people you aren't prepared for yet. Only issue so far is the need for a much larger community, so spread the word on this game.  "

												Edit: 13-Aug-2016 patchEdit to mention the change from the 2.0 patch. (or the patch after new company become the new boss for this game). -Much more players, or the matchmaking was just vastly improve. During non-working hour it only take around 10-15 secs to get a match.-The new company seem to be very generous. The DLC value exceed the price (check each DLC review, someone already calculated the ratio ofthe DLC compare to normal deal from before).-Currently, the price of buying the Rift Run deck is 2000 gold (base price, 40 cards) , equal 10 packs of cards (total 50 cards). If you are looking for specific card, go Rift, you should have more control over your RNGesus by picking specific commander. /as of 10-June-2016 patch.The best Card Game I ever play.This game utilize the advantage of being 'digital' to maximum. You can have cards which have complex effect and almost impossible to play and track physically. (Sleeper Faction is a good example).Another thing I like is that in Rift run (or Draft or Arena in other card game where you pick random card and fight each other for reward.), you can buy the 'whole' deck you build into your collection after the run end. The price is also fair and the price reduce dramatically for each victory. (to the point of it being free if you are good enough)The simultaneously turn system is also very well implemented. It makes the players to 'read' the opponents as a human player. Compare to other turn-based card game which player just make ""Maximize value"" play, the simultaneously turn system encourage players to make deeper and more complex tactics to out mind the opponent and thrown him off balance.This game also deal with zoo deck quite well. Because all card can block (taunt in HeartS) and many powerful abilities which can punish a careless mass zoo, Also, the morale system help to deal with turtle player who just camp. (it's 2nd HP which go down everytime your minions die, like a manpower in Heart of Iron).Also, except from the pack opening, this game have almost 0 RNG (except from Exile, which is not mandatory except you really want to activate the gamble ability). Which is a plus for me compare to HeartStone or other card game.Another thing I like is that you can play resource (mana) to 'draw' card instead of playing what's in your hand depend on the situation. This smooth the problem of bad-drawn a lot and reduce the effect of luck draw; which I do not like personally. And yes, this game contain bugs, but mostly won't crash your PC, and just sent you back to main game menu, and after the recent fix, no win-lose will be counted if bug happen.And about the pay-to-win, other had already address so I won't talk much. But for my experience, Epic and Legendary level card tend to be very situational cards and can be countered or totally avoid by experince players, so it's more of ""lvl 99 vs lvl 1 player"" situation rather than the cards' power itself. (you also get 5 free rotation decks with powerful cards everyweek to try those cards).			"

Early Access Review
								Infinity Wars took Card Games (TCGs) to the next level. If Hearthstone is the casual-friendly, pretty and famous card game - Infinity Wars is the in-depth strategic alternative. Animated cards, simoltanious turns, TRADING OF CARDS, and many more features that give this game a unique feel.If you loved Magic the Gathering, if you enjoy Hearthstone, if you tried any other card game at all, this is for you. To me, personally, this is the 'pro' card game, the one that suits best for advanced players. All that said, players new to the genre will find the community to be super helpful, the game to be easy to learn (and yes, hard to master), and the in-game tutorials to be superb.			"

												Easily as good as Magic the Gathering (better in a lot of ways) and totally free to play. If you do decide to drop some cash the prices are very reasonable too. I spent some to support the Devs but you certainly don't have to have fun and a decent chance of winning. They even have free weekly loan decks and a merged mode where you share a the card pool with your opponent.Couple this with a nice interface and beautiful (and animated) art-work and in my opinion this is the best digital card game money (or not!) can get you.

												My background: Leisure player of Heartstone, Might and Magic: Duel of Champion, Spell WeaverThis game is the LCG that best utilizes the advantage of digital platform and I believe is the best one in term of game play on the market.Pros:-Simultaneous turn which minimizes the downtime and brings a new layer of strategy planning.-Animated card and even playmat, some cards with transform and evo have more than 1 appearance.-Those cards purchased by in game currency and cash can be traded with other players.-Not pay 2 win: New player pre-set decks, draft mode (called rift run which is free for 1 time every 5 day, 3 loses to out), generous daily login gift, skills of deploying card can out play opponent. -8 factions (not counting neutral) with its own characteristics to choose from, you can mix and match up to 3 of them.-Commander which determines your faction of deck, commander can use ability without playing the card or played to battlefield without waiting 1 turn which makes deciding the 3 commanders exciting.-With 5 expansions contribute to a card pool close to 1000, only few cards are not viable, including commons.Cons:-The graphic is a bit old, maybe litmited by animation.-Only 4 factions' starter deck are provided for free, other start deck can only be purchased with cash. -The deck builder shows the cards in a small scale, you need to move the mouse over the text sometimes.-A few bugs can be found, game crashing ones are rare though (only faced 2 times atm).-Easy to learn but very hard to master, this may frustrate new players.-Small player base which result in a little bit if waiting time for PVP. -You may be confused if you missed single card interaction.

												""Free-To-Play"" has replaced ""♥♥♥♥♥♥lapping piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; as  the dirtiest phrase in the English language.   9 times out of 10, these titles are filthy, money-grubbing shams.   Certain developers who shall remain nameless in this review treat their customers like dirt, using manipulation tactics to fleece vast sums of money from their most loyal customers.  It's a disgusting way to do business, and on principle alone I refuse to contribute money towards this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t practice.The sickening culture of freemium (I honestly puked a little bit in my mouth just now while typing that word) gaming is what makes Infinity Wars Steam's best kept secret.Before IW, I refused to spend a red cent on in-game purchases.  I decided, after about 30 hours of awesome gameplay, and after accumulating a library of 700+ cards absolutely free, to put down a little bit of money so that I could support LightMare Studios.  I spent my money because LightMare earned it.  I spent my money because I was impressed by Teremus, who is an active forum member.  He answers tough questions, gives constant feedback and as a gamer, I could sense his own passion for gaming.  Mostly, I spent my money because I didn't feel like I was being tricked into spending my money.  I didn't do it to stay competitive.  I didn't do it because my experience would have otherwise been marginalized.tl:dr - If you like M:TG, this is a must play.  If LightMare stays the course, and continues to resist the temptation of an early payday, this game has a legit chance at surpassing Magic in popularity.			"

												I've been a longtime Hearthstone player so naturally a new card game is bound to pique my interest. Just two days in and I couldn't stop playing this thing. In fact.. I almost felt I couldn't return to Hearthstone afterward, because the strategic complexity is incomparable.At first it all seems straightforward enough but once you mix enough complex cards and mechanics in then the gameplay becomes.. kinda wild. You'll be sitting there stumped with the amount of possible choices to make. That's when the game is at its best. There is also bluffing and juking opponents in this game! Amazing. Because you see, there is no turn taking really, you both operate your turn at the same time, and its an extremelly refreshing change.Now one of the most important parts of a cardgame is the style. The art namely. For my tastes, the art in this game is perfect, all animated with pizazz. The factions and themes are also very creative, maybe not so much the Disciples of the Dragon or the Exiles, but good enough! The soundtrack is super catchy, although a bit sparce, but its enough. Presentation-wise the game does what it needs to do, although its very thread-bare in places.At time of updating this review two years later, the game is still good but the change to the campaign was super♥♥♥♥♥♥ The balance in general is also kinda ♥♥♥♥ey, but then again who the ♥♥♥♥ can name a balanced game these days?

												Well, I tend to write very short reviews, but I'm going to make this one as all-encompassing as I can becase if there was ever a game I felt needed more publicity,  it would be this one.  As I write this review I have around 750ish hours logged in this game, with no signs of stopping. It's addictive, wether you count that as good or bad. And as someone who played Yu-gi-oh and MTG for about 6 years, I can say that this is the best TCG I've ever played. So this is my perspective as a diehard fan and avid player.Pros:   - It's free to play. Not much more to say there.   - The Card art is phenomenal. Each one is fully animated (as seen in the trailor) and the artists do a fantastic job taking          their time on each one to make them perfect.   - The playstyle is unique and innovative. Simultaneous turns is perhaps my favorite part about this game, and what seperates from every other TCG I've played. It allows for players to use a prediction skill and creates the most skill-based plays and combos you can imagine.   - The community is fantastic. Players are helpful towards one another and the devs who hang around in the global chat do a wonderful job making sure new players are fitting in and having a good time.   - There is a quest system where you can unlock achievements for winning games, or even just playing a lot. These quests have reward cards and other vanity items to make yourself look way more pro when you play. Which, at least to me,  is really awesome.   - There is extensive lore behind the game and the factions within (as seen in the trailor, there ar several factions that you can think of as  ""types"" of cards in yu-gi-oh or ""colors"" in magic). The lore is well written and the community writes fanfiction for it all the time on the game's forums. https://www.infinitywarsgame.com/#!/   - There is a great set of campaigns for each faction that allows you to get a starter deck for that faction to play with and adapt.     - Lightmare has recently implemented a system of weekly free decks that players can use without having to actually own the cards. This is great for new players who want to develop strategy and see new ideas, or even for older players to just have some fun.   - There are already several fantastic sets of cards available for purchase at the store with in-game currency or irl money, as well as starter decks preorders when applicable. New sets are released regularly and are heavily hyped with previews and sample cards given as rewards proceeding the release.Cons:   - Not a whole lot of players yet, or at least not as many as this game deserves. This can lead to taking a few minutes to find a game sometimes,  especially when you reach higher rankings, though I have never taken more than 3 minutes to find a game myself.Now for some other info that will only matter for a couple weeks. From november 21st to december 12th the preorders are available for the new set, Order.  On the weekend of the 28th-1st, there will be a double IP/XP weekend. So, if you were thinking about joining this game, now is probably the best time to do it. Lastly, Teremus, the community manager for this game (also known as the beloved/dreaded Terror Moose) streams this game very every saturday.  In particular, during this double IP/XP weekend he will be streaming with another dev and some of the top players of the game to review some unseen cards from the new set, Order. On regular saturdays, he just messes around with the community and plays for fun, and he's always willing to help people out. If you don't know how you feel about this game yet, I encourage you to check his stream out on saturdays. http://www.twitch.tv/infinitywarstcgThat's just about it for me. I fully and wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes TCGs. 10/10. Enthusiatic thumb-up.  5 star quality. However you wanna say it, it's amazing.			"

												After a considerable amount of time playing this game (both my 500 hours in steam and about 1000 in standalone client), and seeing it go through a LOT of issues, changes, and resurfaces, I still can't recommend it to anyone.There are bugs that stood with the game for YEARS, and still haven't been solved despite the community being extremely vocal about them. Including but not limited to: battleground glitches, deck builder crashes, sleepers freezing the game.The devs themselves aren't really charming either. They fail to keep their promises, to communicate with the community, to hire competent people, among other things. They fail to deliver updates on time, to go through with their weekly posts, and to actually put their time to work into meaningful things. With so many issues plaguing the game, daily quest systems and UI reskins shouldn't be a top priority.They've been through so many changes and so many ""rebirths"" with this game. Tons upon tons of promises that go to waste, and updates that are promised to be huge, only to end up being some UI reskins and minor features.They also promised to advertise this game as to increase it's playerbase, but all we've seen in two years are TWO videos from relatively unknown youtubers (as in relatively unknown to the TCG community, that is. Hell, one of them features a cuvy woman being paid to talk about games while wearing tight clothing. Really?)I'm not really good at writing reviews, honestly. I fell in love with this game due to it's unique mechanics, pretty card art, lore and community, but it is clear that it won't go anywhere. There are other TCGs that are only months old yet are accomplishing x10 times what IW has accomplished in 3 years.I only log onto it about once every 3 months now, just to see that everything is exactly the same as it was the last time. It's a shame, for a game with such a huge potential, to go to waste due to incompetent devs. "

								I'll start off by saying that despite me personally not liking this game, it is for sure NOT a pay to win game.  People that complain about it being one either didn't play enough or are just salty about not being good with the mechanics of this game.  I would actually argue that it is a bit too easy to obtain cards in this game without really paying anything.  The draft mode makes it incredibly easy to obtain cards and it's not difficult at all to at least break even, given that you are at least somewhat decent at the game.  This makes me wonder how Lightmare plans on staying in business when they give away cards so freely through the various rewards.With that said, this tcg does have a very different spin from the other more classic card games and is not quite to my liking.  The simultaneous turn is interesting but the mindgame it provides causes some imbalance between the factions and may cause some frustrating gameplay experiences.The community for this game feels like it's full of elitist card gamers that are too cool for other more mainstream games.  Overall my experiences with my opponents have been mostly negative due to bad manners.  Regardless, I am fairly impressed with the community manager's passion for this game and I would recommend this game eventually when and if it does become more balanced.  For now the small elitist community itself and the somewhat mediocre balancing is keeping me away from this game.			"

												Do you like instant gratification?Do you like a game were you don't need to think?Do you like to always win?Do you like pay to win?If you answered NO to all those questions then this game maybe for you! First I would like to say I am a 100% free player.This game is tough for new players. It takes time to gather cards to build the decks of your dreams. Expecting to get all that in a few weeks will not happen. If you are going to play free, it will take time to gather cards (6 Months to get good). You will get a lot of free cards if you play regularly. Sinking in 1h during evening a few days in a row and get rewards, play a few round and you’re good! You can also play all day, get in game currency at the end of every game and buy more cards with it. If you’re patient it build up fast.This game requires careful planning. Preparing your decks, making every card count before you even see the opponent, is key. You need a plan!! BUT every deck has its strength but also its weaknesses. You can never find an unbeatable deck… hard ones to beat, yes, but there’s always something that can tear them apart... including luck. The question is “Dose your deck have the right cards to do that?” If it doesn’t, then work towards getting those cards. If you don’t like working towards your goals then you answered yes to the first question.That game has amazing strategy. There are many variables to take account of. The type of deck that are in play (Knowing all that cards in the game, when they can be played and with what deck is important, it takes time to get familiar but that comes naturally). Luck of the draw. Placement of your unites in the right Zone. The order of unites (The one at the front will enter combat first, actuate order can determine damage, both health and morale). When to use the right cards. Guessing your opponents moves. Card turn order (some cards will be played before others). Even if you play vs the exact same deck, the game (even sometimes the game outcome) will be completely different because of all those factors. Lots to think about. You will lose a lot. I view myself as an ok player. Probably lose 50% of the time. Some days I win 1 game out of 10 played, the next day win 9 out of 10 games using the exact same deck. Some days are just frustrating and others you just feel like a GOD!! It’s not fun to lose… I know! That said you only lose (sometimes win) the match, but you ALWAYS get points for finishing a game. NOT if you quit…If you lose a lot, look at other good player decks and copy what you like or work out you’re deck weakens. Speed? Defense? Attack? Cards combos? Neat card abilities? (I know, you need more cards… than go back to question 1)I don’t view this game as pay to win. Pay to get ahead faster, yes, and I am all for it! The devs do need money to run the game and add content over time. A player that buys cards gets certain cards, sometimes alternate card art but never gains access to cards that free players can’t have. As a free player you can have it all, as a paying players you can have it all faster. That’s it! The only negative for new players is that they will face players that have a lot more cards to their arsenal. There are different game types available and premade decks available for players that are still building there card library. New players will fell a bit like the underdog till they build the card library and that can take time as a free player. That said, if you had it all from the start, there would be no incentive to play to try and get all the cards!The game can be grinding but that’s the challenge I set my self! I play just to try and get all the cards and its fun PvP. As a free player, I am very close to that goal!!! Hope to see you on the battle field!			"

Early Access Review
								I really want to like this game, it bring something new to the electronic tcg genre. Unfortunately it is plagued with problems and I am getting tired of waiting for it to get better.Card balance is terrible; there are 8 factions,  yet every single competitive deck has at least a splash of Cult of Verore. I can understand why, they have all of the direct kill spells, and a very easy board wipe that has no counter play. Sorry, when you bring up that Mass Death has no counter play, the designers of the game say ""just don't attack or defend from turn 6 onwards"", thanks for the advice. This game's card balance is one of the worst out of all the tcgs, you just see the same decks with the same cards over and over again.The user interface is buggy and slow. It is often impossible to understand what is going on due to being unable to click on cards to see their text. Games drop out often or just flat out stall, leaving you to have to forfeit a game to be able to load a new one. I highly doubt that the game will ever be optimised to be able to run on a tablet like they have claimed, the game is just too much of a memory sink.Abilities and cards do not operate how their text is written, you often have to play a test game when you get a new card just to figure out what the designers mean. The timing of how cards operate is never logical. If you are playing against an opponent with a card you have never seen before, you have to loose to that card just to see what it does. When a new set comes out, the process of learning the mechanics of a whole bunch of cards happens again. You could look all the new cards up, but what is written on the card doesn't always represents what happens in the game. The latest set Ascension has some terrible offenders: Anti-Air Array kills incoming flying creatures, but those creature still do combat damage from the graveyard, the card Descension turns a creature into a demonic dragon, but has the Consume ability, despite not being mentioned anywhere on the card. I haven't played against all the new cards yet, who knows how exactly they all work.Lastly I am going to talk briefly on the very touchy subject of pay-to-win. I don't know what you may consider pay-to-win, but I am going to only consider the most basic interpretation, that if you pay money, you will get an advantage in game. OK, so I was about two weeks into playing daily, I had got the hang of the game and started to play competitively. I stalled out at about 800 rank due to the people I was playing having better decks. I figured I had to get some better cards. I couldn't trade cards because the free cards you get aren't tradeable. I could buy a booster using winnings from playing games, but that takes about 47 games at a 50% win rate. I eventually relented and spent some real world dollars. OMG, literally overnight I went up to 1100 rank. Within the week I was sitting at 1450. I'm now starting to slow again and I have to decide if it is worth spending more money to remain competitive, especially with a new set with all new powerful cards that I can't afford.Infinity Wars is a good game, with unique gameplay and plenty of strategy. But for a game that is nearly finished its beta, it doesn't feel even close to ready.			"

												Don't waste your time. The devs of this game have repeatedly shown their incompetence, from releasing patches that claim that bugs have been fixed when they aren't (same bug over multiple patches in some cases), to their Community Manager sending insulting and harassing PMs to players both in and out of game, Infinity Wars is simply a bizarre mess. When I first picked this game up I fell in love with it, in spite of the numerous bugs and balance issues. Now, over two years later, with the bugs still rampant and uncorrected, and the devs showing a clear lack of interest in either growing the game or engaging with the player base, the time has come to let this corpse of a game finally rest in peace.I would advise anyone looking at this game to steer clear, but if you do feel an overwhelming urge to try it out - do not under any circumstances spend money on it, you will regret it very quickly.

Edit (12/21/2016) - Checked back in on the new IW Reborn ""Gold"" update.  Just a UI reskin and a new set... sadly, my review remains unfortunately accurate - another four months down the road, and it's still a low pop. game with too many bugs and a dev team more interested in further monetizing than they are in fixing their game. Original review follows:Months and months with the new devs, and a ridiculous amount of issues persist: Dozens of bugs, many of them game-breaking - including wins and losses not registering in ranked play. Extremely limited draft pool, majority of cards need heavy balancing and are restricted from draft. Long ranked queues are only getting longer, constant matches against the same players - no matter how many are online. Even when the devs try to fix something, it rarely works.  Such as the three cards ""removed"" from ranked a few weeks ago that still pop up.New dev team seems more interested in putting out new sets, DLC, and (for who knows what reason) tournaments for the ~150 playerbase.  Too bad, because this game could be great... and it never will be.  Seriously, they've patched all of three bugs since the beginning of the year.  Don't waste your time (and money) like I did.			"

												Some of the Reviews below are old... so here's mine10/10Let me preface this review with my history - I used to play Magic, I do play Hearthstone.  I have tried Hex, and the recent Spellweaver game (spellweaver also looks very promising, give it 6 months)Infinity wars is really good.  It is my favorite and now only TCG that i play.  I like it better than Magic or Hearthstone.  The simultaneous turns, attacka and support lanes, 3 ""commander"" cards (aka 3 cards you guarantee to have playable, dont need to draw), make this game have incredible depth.-You can trade cards wiith other players - really good.  I hate how in Hearthstone I can only disenchant.The superficial, but still important, graphics and theme put it over the top for me.  I love the animated cards, art, and kind of science/fantasy fiction lore.The combos you can perform are many, unique, and very clever.This game will become more and more polished as time goes on.  It is not as clean as Hearthstone atm.There are a wide variety of match formats (although I pretty much just play standard and standard ranked)   2v2 is in the works (cant wait)Give it a shot.  Play the tutorial levels, which unlock multiple decks and introduce the different colored decks.  If you arent hooked by the end of the tutorial missions, id be shocked.			"

								Definitely worth a try if you like a good iTCG. Compared to Hearthstone and MTG i'd put Infinity Wars just below MTG in regards to depth (simply because they do not have as many sets as MTG). The F2P aspect of the game is fair and the inclusion of a easily accessed draft mode has me hooked so far			"

												It's a very well done game.  Love the art and animation.  I like that there is a campaign, however, it is pretty poorly acted with ham-fisted dialogue.  I like the simulatanous gameplay a lot.  Where this game fails is it's additional purchases.  These are 'lightmare' points, which are exorbant.  The basic purchase ($1.xx) gets you 125 lightmare points...which buys absolutely nothing in the game.  The cheapest purchase that I could find was 150 lightmare points.  So why would they even bother putting this purchase level in.  They have some very interesting preconstructed decks but those cost something like 1750 lightmare points which translates to $25!  For 1 virtual deck?   I like to support 'free' games where possible, but this game is just too expensive.			"

												This game was great when it started and had its ups and downs but in the last few monts this games has really crashed and burned. It used to be a nice take on other online TCGs like hearthstone with its own twist. In infinity wars both players plan their turn at the same time and the cards are fully animated. But what really sold it for me is you could get EVERY CARD by just playing the game and without spending real money. Now you can only get a handful of cards without spending ridiculus amounts of cash. This makes some of those competitive hearthstone people look like cheap skates. I remember distinctly (I was a beta tester had the game longer than most people who play) that the only advantage monewy gave you was advancing faster and getting some ALT art cards. Now unless you are willing to pay money you can only get the first 100ish cards released (most of which are total crap and have direct upgrades in thier own faction). I have nothing against you playerss who choose to spend money on games, I myself have spent money on F2P games and bought DLC but having to spend money to stand a competitve chance is just ridiculous.

								Great game with a huge amount of depth and versatility. Awesome free to play Trading Card Game with lots of card interaction and great deck ideas. All the cards are animated and have their own effect animations. 8 factions give you a wide variety of styles to choose from and mixing of factions allows even more. There are several formats including draft, pauper, singleton, merged, various 'game speeds', and the traditionally normal and ranked. Developer has voiced several more formats to come. Currently two card sets are released with another on the way within the next few weeks. Three weekly quests give you ideas as well as reward you with cards (including sneak previews of upcoming sets). Only drawback is that it's still in beta which means occasional bugs and having to wait for the new features, but I'm excited for all that's coming. Overall very engaging, good matching system so you're always against people of your skill level, and loads of fun making decks.			"

I'll start with the better aspects of this game:- There is a campaign for each faction within the game which rewards you with a basic structure deck for that campaigns faction on completion.- Simultaneous turn system means players can't do the perfect counter ever time and makes you think more about what your opponent may or may not do.- Plenty of training modes and several PvP modes.-  On-entry drafting PvP mode which allows you to buy the deck on completion of this mode at varying prices including free if you do well enough.- High quality animated artwork for each card.- Well designed playing fields.Now the reasons I say to avoid this game:- In Constructed PvP players are drawn to 3 main builds that are very difficult to counter for new players or players who are learning the game.- Entering the the PvP drafting mode is expensive, requiring about 8 wins or up to 14 losses for players who struggle building decks. This may seem like an alright trade off until you realise that games can take from 5 minutes if you/they are far higher in deck strength to 30minutes if the turns take long time or you are in a stalemate.- Playing the on-entry drafting mode requires you to only win as it uses a ""3 life rule"". Losing your first 3 matches will mean a return on only 25% at most of the entry fee as in-game currency regardless of the pay-in method.- The deck you make in the on-entry drafting mode is highly expensive, costing up to 30 times the entry fee and requiring 15+ wins in a row with that deck to make it viable to buy.- You will make only a fraction of the entry fee back for the on-entry drafting mode unless you win 10+ games in a row.- There is no obvious player matching system and is done completely at random in all PvP modes leading to repeat matching with a single player in some cases even if you have lost to them several times in a row.- Booster packs are expensive requiring 35-40 constructed wins to get 15 new cards or upto double that with losses.- Seems to be trying to force players to buy premium currency in order to get new cards or play in on-entry drafting PvP mode. This will be more noticeable if you are struggling to win constructed games.game rating: 4.5/10			"

												So, what is Infinity Wars, and why should you try it over any other TCG? First off, let's get this out of the way: the game is pretty complex and your enjoyment of it may vary depending on your TCG experience. Either way, the basic game mechanics should be familiar: players have a health meter, draw a card each turn, cards have a resource cost, you get 1 resource per turn. (I will not be using the game's own terms because there's no point in doing that if you have never played it). There are creature cards, spell cards, artifacts and field/location cards, which all work in a similar way to MtG's equivalents.Cards have attack and defense values, and they do not gain their defense back at the end of the turn. Now, here's the part that sets Infinity Wars apart from others: the zones and simulaneous turns.Let's start with the zones. You have a Support Zone, a Defense and Assault Zone and a Command Zone.The Support Zone is where a creature will go if you play it from your hand. Call it summoning sickness if you want, it's what prevents you from playing it on the battlefield right away. You can keep a creature there for as long as you wish, and you can also retire your active creatures there at the start of your turn. The Assault and Defense zones are where creatures attempt to attack the enemy's health or defend their player respectively. When attacking, you have to go through your enemy's defending creature pool if you are to deal damage to them. If the enemy has 5 creatures and you have 4, no matter their stats, you will not manage to attack his health (assuming all creatures don't have some form of text that changes that).However, the opposite is not true. If you have one 1/20 creature defending and the enemy attacks with 20 1/1's, everything will die at the end of the turn. So how does battle work? The answer is pretty simple: it is done automatically. Once you place your creatures on one Zone, they will all attempt to attack or defend starting from the leftmost creature. You can change the order or the Zone during your turn at will, but not after the automated battle has started. Before I continue, I have to mention that one player gets Initiative each turn alternatively. You will see what that means very soon.And that's where the simultaneous turns come in. While you were planning your trades to be statistically in your favor, the enemy has been doing the same. When you both click ""end planning"", spell effects will be triggered first (and, if both players used a spell, the one with the Initiative has his trigger first), and then, if any creatures are left alive, the battle begins. If you are a little confused by this, don't worry, the battle phase is very easy to figure out once you actually play the game. As a side note, you can get amazing trades if you position any creature that gets buffed correctly. If you have a 4/4 that heals itself for 2 every time it kills something, it can kill an infinite number of 2/2's.Remember the Support Zone? If you think that an enemy is going to use a spell that kills one or more of your creatures, you can retreat your vunlerable creatures back into it for the turn, and the enemy is going to completely waste his spell. This creates a lot of ""mindgames"" during matches, and you feel incredibly satisfied when you manage to outsmart your opponent in such a way.The Command Zone contains any 3 cards in your deck that are chosen prior to the game's start. They are revealed to both players to make the mechanic more fair. Their cost is the same, but you can put them directly into the Assault or Defense zones without making the transition to the Support Zone. If you do not do that, they stay in the Command Zone. So how can you use that to your advantage? Apart from playing powerful cards quickly, you can let them build up stats if they have a passive ability (+x/+x for every creature that dies, for example) or activate their abilities safely (pay x: deal x damage to a creature, for example).Finally, there are two more small mechanics that make the gameplay more varied: cards have a Morale cost, which is a secondary resource. When a creature with 2 morale dies, you lose that morale. If you have 0 Morale, you lose the game, exactly like your health. This is useful if you are running a defensive deck that doesn't have much damage, and makes tanking and stalling strategies more viable. The last mechanic is the Trading Post, where you can use your leftover resources to shuffle a card (or your hand, on turn 1), draw a card or increase your max resources by 1. This means that you have always something to do with your resources even with a bad hand, and it also means that some cards can cost more than 9 resources (which is the normal maximum) and have absolutely gamebreaking effects.Now that we're done with the game's rules, let's talk a little bit about the game itself. It has a client of its own (like LoL, for example) where you can play, buy packs, edit decks, see your achievements and tweak the settings all in one. The client is a little slow, and I have often encountered some bugs if I click things too quickly before they load properly. There are also some minor connectivity problems, but most of the time you are not going to lose any of your progress. My biggest gripe with the UI is the deck builder, it seems really clunky and counter-intuitive to me. Also, more customization options for text size would be welcome.You can play a wide variety of game modes, ranging from an impressively large campaign with voice acting and a storyline (something a lot of TCG's shy away from) to a ranked mode and a rift run (which is something like random draft, or Arena in Hearthstone). There are some free decks to choose from each week, and some of them can stand on their own against custom decks, which means a newer player can have a shot even if he hasn't accumulated many cards on his own. You can buy packs with in-game money or real money, and the pricing model seems fairly standard. There is also card trading, which is a major plus for me.There are multiple factions in the game, and their gameplay mechanics and art style are really varied and interesting. All cards also have Purity, which means that you need to have at least x of a certain type of Commander to be able to play them. For example, the most extreme rush cards would require 3 Flame Dawn Commanders. Some of the game's 9 factions include:War40k-inspired demons that have chaotic and destructive discard and exile effects.Cold and calculating machines that buff themselves or deal long-range damage.Anime-style tech angels that fly over your defenses and ascend to higher forms.Mechanical zombies that eat creatures so you can play them yourself next turn.The card art is really cool and fitting for each faction's ideals, and so are the animations. Some of them even go as far as telling a small story in a few frames, which really shows the work put into each individual card. Speaking of which, there are a LOT of cards in the game, I am stil discovering new ones every day. The battlefield in which you play in is 3D rendered, and can even change if you play a Field card.The music and sound effects are not exactly brilliant, but you will probably not notice them anyway, as anything too distracting would've been detrimental to the game.As a final thought to close this colossal review, if you are somehow still undecided, I have to say that this game deserves to be tried at least for its attempt to introduce new mechanics to a fairly tired genre. It has MtG's complex mechanics, strategic battles and card trading while also boasting nice visuals and a free-to-play model. I'm glad I found it, and, even though it's not perfect, I think it deserves way more recognition.			"

												When this was first released AKA when I first started playing it was a very good game. In its current state I can't recommend it as the developers stopped communicating well with the community, very much unlike when the game first launched. What they've prioritized in developing the game is not to its betterment, and the game is now suffering through the pitfalls other card games already go through rather than learning from them. Worth trying if you want to see new ideas, but not worth putting much cash into. I'm very sad that I can not recommend this game as it is today.			"

												Great game if you enjoy a good TCG. I've been playing on and off between other games for a while and still enjoy it a lot. Yes it has glitches but none are 'game breaking' as one or two others suggest. There are regular patches and updates from what I have seen and read in the forums.It has a friendly helpful community, which is good for new players. I've seen many times experienced players giving useful cards to new players to help out, as well as plenty of advice and tactics. The forums are active and useful too.Another big plus is this game really is not pay to win. The mechanics make sure of that. It doesn't matter how amazing or powerful your cards are, if you do not know how to use them correctly by practicing against a variety of different players, you will still lose. Some players hate playing against powerful cards like 'Calamity'. However if you prepare or out maneuver your opponent you can win even with a starter deck.This game has a lot of content and cards and they have some nice plans for the future. With the introduction of new cards and a mission feature yesterday it's a sign the game will continue to improve which is great.The main negative I have found is the queues can be long for ranked and draft matches. A lot of the time I get straight in no problem. If i'm waiting more than a few minutes I ask in chat (which usually solves the problem), play another game for a while or continue waiting while I do something else. It's no big deal. Since the release of new content I have noticed the queues are improving a lot too.I thoroughly recommend this game to any TCG fan or even any type of strategist for that matter.			"

												Very cool game.  Too bad it is ruined completely by a terrible business model.This game uses the antiquated ""trading"" system, instead of the newer crafting system that a lot of TCGs use today.  Your progression in the game is essentially in the hands of how much you want to sit in chat and ask to trade with people, and then expect them to want an arm and a leg for the cards you want.  Ohh fun!In the beginning you get a lot of cards very quickly from achievements and the single player campaign, but once that is over with then you can expect roughly a week of playing casually to earn enough to buy one booster pack.  That's right.. a whole week of playing the same basic deck over and over just to get one booster which will likely not contain anything you need for your deck.Daily events offer single, random cards instead of money, so don't expect to be able to rack up money quicker through daily quests like in Hearthstone.  Also there is nothing you can do with duplicate cards except trade them (if they are tradable, which a lot of your cards will not be).I cannot say much about the matchmaking system, because I sat in the queue for about 15 minutes before I gave up and went back to playing against the practice bots.For me the game just feels a bit bland, especially since it takes you (and the RNG gods) quite a while to progress into a deck that you like or have interest in.

												This game has certainly had its ups and downs. I've obviously put a decent amount of time into the game, and in no way feel like any of that time was wasted. It's hands down the best digital card game I've ever played. The simultaneous turns are a mechanic that provide sooo much strategic depth. The current problem with the game is that there just aren't that many people playing it right now. With an increased user base (hopefully coming with this next expansion), I really hope to see this game take off like it deserves to.			"

												Okay, as a new player to this but an experienced player in tcgs, at first i thought this game is perfect for me, I already wrote a review yeterday but im not sure it got published so i try to make it short:Pros: Bunch of cardsNice animationsGreat Campaign modeinteresting mechanicsCons: Some tech stuff: If you're trying to run this on an older laptop you might run into several problems like for me the battlegrounds were pitch black ( due to my integrated vga),The game crashes a lot, after playing for an hour it slows down and eventually crash it does it faster when i'm trying to make my decks.Logging in depending on your location can take 3-5-10 minutes which wouldn't be that much of a problem if the game didn't crashed all the time.Now aside from these: Matchmaking is seriously unfair, you constantly get stomped on by turn 3-4 and that's it. they just rush you down. From 10 matches i never fought a noob like myself.Because of this, and the eventual grindiness i will delete it, after i'll post this. It's more frustrating than Hearthstone if that's even possible at least for me.This was just my experience with it but before trying it out i would advise you to take a look at the other negative reviews and than decide for yourself if you wanna get into something that you might like at first site but after completing the campaigns you might instantly erase from your harddrive like me.

												This game beat every TCG out there in term of gameplay's mechanism, strategy ... But a lot of ""little"" details killed this game.The good:- Gameplay: simultaneous turn, very unique, quite attractive when you understand how it works.- All cards are animated, and the design itself is acceptable, some cards are pretty awesome like Nyx, Avatars ...The bad:- Unfriendly UI. Until now, I still have no idea to add a player in my ignore list, or find a guy I just met and all I remember is just his name ... A lot of ""extend"" options in this game will be perform via command line, which I think is very very unfriendly !- Terrible matchmaking. In the past, IW had an option named ""Only match me against new player"". A lot of my friends, they just pass lv 4 to enter PvP's area, having around 400-500 cards in their bags, with a little of decent  rare cards, they've to fight  against a guy with nearly 1000 hrs in this game with all kind of highest stuff. Imagine what happen when an ordinary man throw himself to a modern tank, the same thing happen here. Thanks God, they removed that options, but seem like the problem still there. A friend of mine, he is lv 16 atm, but he still have to fight a dozen of ""tank"" players like that.- Bug: trade - bug, in a normal games - bug, in a ranked game - bug, in a draft game - bug. If you can play this game for more than 2 hours flawlessly without encounter a single bug, well you are very very lucky. I've spent nearly 500 hrs of my life into this game. I believe I've achieved nearly everything in this game (I was in top 25 players, I had more than 20 games in 1 sigle draft ...) I really want to recommend this game, but sadly I can't. Sorry for my English, and goodbye Infinity Wars, I wil miss you ! "

												Ok what i am about to say might be a little biased due to my immense distain for terrible matchmaking servers so just pointing that outOk this game is good...if you think good is just being constantly stomped by people who have clocked in god knows how many hours and got a deck that is made to just mow you down in a matter of turns.Pros : +Loads of cards+Not a pay2win+Good combinations+Interesting lore+easy to learn and a massive challenge to master (you'll see why below)+So many other things+Somewhat good community+I guess the animated cards can be interestingCons :-♥♥♥♥ing terrible matchmaking (I haven't played against someone my skill once...against my 100 matches)-In order to get more cards outside the campaign you have to win matches to get a good amount of ingame currency-You see that on your screen, its a bug my friend (Some bugs are present)-Now this is just me ranting but i hate the rift run matchmaking. (Its pretty much the same as normal ingame match making...only you'll get paired someone with the same losses and wins as you, Regardless of your overall skill)Now i would recommend this game if i had patiance for constantly 'failing' against my opponents...So basicly if your not a fast learner stay away from this gameEDIT : Thanks to AtsumaSeven for pointing out the fact that it is indeed a pay2win.

								I and my friends have been enjoying this game for about a month or two now, and still log in every day.  You are given and can earn tons of free cards, so much so that this is obviously not a Pay To Win type setup.  In-game purchasing is not required to get the rare/epic/legendary cards.  Heck, I've 'won' a legendary or two  as the randomized daily prize for simply logging in each day.The game is still in Beta right now, but I have high hopes for the game and its future.Give the game a try.  Its free, its fun, and its challenging!Edit : accidently spelled Pay To Win as Play To Win.  Fixed :)			"

The pvp feature is really fun and addictive as well..i was not to big on the pvp in cards right away but having played this it made the exp of pvp much more fun .The art work is second to none love the animations but not only does it look good it plays very well the mechanics are awesome and the card synergy and play styles are all very unique as well I rate this game an 8/10 well on its way to 10/10 .

								Do you like TCG? 1) Yes 2)  No? well this is a TCG...1)  Do you find them too simple and not deep enough these days? You like Hearthstone but feel you want more meat? 3)  Yes 4)  No3)  This game is for you. There's bluffing, mind games, combos upon combos, a great community that's helpful,  among other stuff, plus the cards are great to look at. The Devs are very repsonsive and interacts with the fan base daily in chat.4)  Hey, no problem, Hearthstone/Kingdoms CCG, other dTCGs are there for you. This game isn't for you though. You can net deck with this game and you will lose pretty hard.  I've played Yu-Gi-Oh, a little Magic, Shadow Era, Forgotten Myths, Kingdoms, Pokemon, MM:DoC. This is the only one where I find they strike a great balance between a F2P where it doesn't interfere with gameplay and gameplay that is deep as you can possibly imagine.

Suprising balalnced game as well. Most imporantly it is easy to find a match. However the story and single player AI still needs work.

The UI is broken, with scrollbars that don't scroll, buttons that appear in the wrong place, so you have to click where they should be, and even cards ingame that can't be clicked.  It's impossible to play with your own deck unless you spend hundreds of dollars, like the people you will be playing against.  The situation is so bad, the game pays players to play with daily rewards.  The only part of the game that is still accessible and fun is the draft game called ""Rift Runs"", which requires in game currency to play.			"

								There is no short-and-sweet answer for how much this game should be loved or even revered by the gaming community. Why you may ask? Because this game is not a pay-to-win game like many free games are. Much like League of Legends, each victorious match rewards ""IP"" which can be used to purchase booster packs, profile icons, etc. Of course, you can straight up buy the things with real money too.As for the fun of the game, it's quite unique in its playstyle, offering advanced strategy, and several campaigns! There is no penalty for losing, which encourages players to continue matches until they win and level up. This game is extremely generous with its reward system, offering cards at the drop of a hat, which can and will further expand your deck!All in all, if there was a 1-10 scale i can rate this game at, it would ultimately be 8.5 out of 10. A very good game, and definately worth trying, even for those who are not into card-based games!			"

												Played this back in 2014 and recently gave it another shot. One of the better card games out there at the moment, in my opinion.  A lot of work went into the cards visuals, which are very nicely done. Not an easy game to get into, but if you give it a chance, it can be very rewarding and fun.Seems like marketing and PR is/was nonexistant, which is a real shame beacause I think this game deserves a bigger playerbase. The small playerbase doesn't do the matchmaking much good, either. And that's sad, because this just drives the new players it so badly needs away.I wouldn't say it's very pay to win, but there's that feel here and there (a good number of older cards being not near as good as more recent ones, for instance). Once you reach level 20 and don't get the level-up rewards anymore, it can get a bit grindy to earn the in-game currency to spend on boosters, but that shouldn't be news to anyone. All in all It all felt relatively fair to me. Draft tokens, however, are on the expensive side.Solid 8/10 for the game itself. Hopefully the playerbase will grow into the healthy numbers, otherwise this game might go out with a fizzle.			"

												This game honestly has me stumped on how I feel about it. On the one hand, the game itself is incredibly unique, and the card animations are awsome. I enjoy the simultanious turns and the stategies it allows. I alos enjoy how incredibly dirverse the purity mechanic can make the game. Finnaly (for the positives, atleast), the command zone gives decks a huge boost of consistancy while also letting certain factions (Exiles and Cult of Verore come to mind) disrupt decks easily via removal that can target the command. It opens up a huge avenue for strategic gameplay.What I dislike it the catering to specific playstyles. Since first picking up the game a while back, I have seen the developers systematically remove control options, especially for my favorite faction: Descendants of Dragon. Their defensive playstyle and alt wincons have been attacked again and again, as has the standard control faction: Cult of Verore. Meanwhile the rush factions, like Order of Solace and FlameDawn have seen nothing but buffs.Overall, I think that if Lightmare had treated all playstyles equally, I would be playing Infinity Wars instead of writing this comment. As it stands, the decks I like either no longer exist, or have been knee-capp'd so hard, they can't win games. What a waste of so much potential.			"

												Overall, this is the BEST online TCG I have ever played. And that's me saying that so it means a lot. Lol.  I've played practically every MMO and online TCG/CCG that has been released. Infinity Wars offers great gameplay, an awesome community, and environment everyone can enjoy!Alright, let's start off with the negative to get all you bum-whats out of the way.Negatives:People complain about earning packs and grinding... Let's get this straightened out. So you play a match against someone who has obviously paid for their cards, you lost, and no you are that angry little girl in the corner. Oh well, one match you lost, big deal!How you can get free cards:Campaign. You get a free introduction with a solid base of what you really need to make a deck. These are great trial decks to have some fun with the cards you already have.Daily rewards- I logged in and received SOL.Leveling up- Free 13-15 card packs?!?Victory of the dayMaster & Apprentice System- a pack with 3 free cards for every match you play togetherOther negatives- There are some minor bugs people complain about, even though they get squashed, but sometimes they can take a little time to be addressed.  Grinding takes too longAbout the grind: What other game already gives you so many cards, ways to earn them and the fact now you can grind, which is optional to earn DECKS mind you, and packs you want. Research about the packs and decks before you buy them! Buy a deck, not a blister pack!Now on to the positives:The community is spectacular.  People are very helpful and will always point you in the right direction. Some people will provide you with free cards knowing they want you to enjoy a greater time.  There are often tournaments, and great communities you can join as well to ""enhance"" ;) your gaming experience.The gameplay. Nothing, and not one TCG or game I have played has ever come close to this. From the commander zone combination along with an assault/defence, simultaneous turns/resolves. They offer two ways to win. By either health or morale. You have an option on how you want to defeat someone along with drawing them or 'double' explosions.The developers/management: They are very close to the players that make the game. Teremus and Schumi are great people that always answer all questions, even the less logical ones. They hold conversations and not only answer questions, upon other duties expected by them. (hopefully?) xDMusic. The music is nice. +The shop.  Decks, mats, card backings, it's all included in a shop for a reasonable price. For $20 you can walk away with a deck and 2-3 packs sometimes.  There is no place to buy singles, but you can trade for those easily.Resource Pool- You have your resource pool. So want to complain about luck? Pay 3 resources to shuffle a card and draw 1. Pay 5 to draw a new card. 9 to gain a new maximum resource.And there are cards that change the tide of battle. This goes in to the whole mentality of bluffing, when to play certain cards and when not to.My community. {SSC}SoulSobriety Multi-Gaming Community is just SOULicious.  We bring players closer together, have a great time, create tournaments, and our very own website.Now let's get real. We all know I wrote this interesting and lengthy review knowing that you, the reader, would read to the very bottom just so you could see my recruitment message. Outplayed!  In all seriousness, I would have babies with the game, it's staff, spend the $20 if need be, and call it a day.Infinity Wars 2014 (psst it's 2015): Animated Trading Card Game deserves a 9/10.  This game provides a unique gaming experience, that will not only keep you coming back, but wanting to see more from the game. Thanks for the management who made this happen along with the developers. I can not wait to see what you will bring us in the future.(I never write lengthy reviews like this unless I really appreciate a game >.>)			"

								The premise of this game is unique in the way turns are played out. The simutanious turns allows for more thoughtfull and smooth game play while also adding a steep learning curve that rewards players who pick up on subtle tricks. It is far from a pay to win game as it generously gives players free cards and points for them to either buy booster packs, full size theam decks as well as a option to draft. The animations and artwork on the cards are incredibly well done.  That said the meta for this game is rather stale as decks are mostly comprised of the top players decks which makes playing rather repeditive. While there are some minor to annoying bugs in the game suchs as a endless turn bug. The biggest issues stem from the company and player base who file every match breaking bug and exploit as acceptible because its a beta. That one line is used over and over again for what seems to be every issue. The exploiters are the worst batch of the bunch. They constantly use bugs and glitches as a means to get easy wins. From abusing knows issues in the client to play cards for free, using the command zone to use desyncs to bend the way cards work. While there is a report player option is rarely seems to accomplise anything as alot of exploiters climb to the top level of the ranking system. While many bugs are regularly patched the system still doesnt punshing long term exploiters. This game is good if you into a lack of diversity for a almost nonexsistant ranked system and only want to play the casual match here and there.			"

												I really, really, really wanted to like this game. The gameplay is interesting and allows for some creativity. The art is beautiful and the storyline manages to be halfway interesting. I ignored the first couple of crashes that made me have to restart it, several times in the middle of campaign battles. I dealt with the matchmaking that threw my deck made out of the meager cards you get from the campaign against decks that have actually been put together with a serious strategy in mind. I accepted that you would have to grind for hours to just get a single randomized 15 card booster pack. After all that, what finally led me to uninstall it was the wonderful discovery that some cards have incorrect text, which led me to lose a draft battle that I spent half of the in-game currency I had earned in my 7 hours of playing just to get into. It might be free, but it's not worth your time.			"

												Dont bother. Lightmare lacks a proffesional company structure to ever raise this game from substandard. You will like it, but it will break. Be wise and dont waste your time and money into this one.

Lightmare seems to be in over their heads and unable to present a bugfree and working game. No it gets betters. Fixing the game doesnt even seem their priority. They waste 3 months of precious time into only to reveal a set of pure♥♥♥♥♥♥ They are nice guys and  their hearts are obviously in this game, but they remain amateurs. They dont have the experience nor skill to make this work. I feel harsh for being this brutal, but its simply true.			"

												My personal favorite F2P TCG.Pros:Unique (not just a MTG clone like oh so many out there)Concurrent turns reduces ""downtime"" quite a bitNice art (subjective)Fairly easy to get cards just by playing, I haven't spent a dime (but I do play a lot, as my profile shows)Great community, easy to get a question answered, toxicity is rareCons:Small team behind the game so updates/new content can come at a trickle sometimesSomewhat low playerbase (rises as falls with the release of new cards/patchesTrade screen could use an overhaul to make it more user friendlyNo mobile port (not yet anyway)All in all, as an old scholl MTG player who was disappointed in most F2P card games out there for one reason or another, this one really sratches that itch for me, and it does it for FREE.

												Before you try this game, there are some warnings:- This game is still buggy.- The developers communicate poorly with it's players.- The PvP is harsh on new players- There are not a lot of players, so cue times can be long.If this didn't discourage you, then you came to the right place.+ The ""commander"" based system is why the RNG factor in infinity wars is below average.+ The ""zone"" based mechanics is what makes infinity wars feel very fresh.+ The simultanious turns make predicting your opponent very rewarding.+ The ingame players are very friendly, a lot of veterans will give new players cards for free.+ The animated art, the trailer on this page doesn't do them justice.Infinity Wars has a lot of problems, but gameplay is not one of them.

												Don’t waste your time.The game itself is fun, its unique simultaneous play system adds bluffing and prediction to the game that you jest don’t see in other online card games. That stated i have log over 50+ hours into the game and have nothing to show for it. You get a decent number of cards to start and they are good enough to build a good deck or two but with the arbitrary baring of ranked play until you have reached level 20 (and with 50+ hours of grinding i never did) and the draft system being time sink at best and gambling at its worst there is not much you can do except random PVP battles. the fact that you can’t trade your starting card or all the packs you get from leveling up, and the fact that you need on average 50 games to get 1 booster of 15 cards, makes it so that your card library gets stale fast and your deck options dwindle to those that can get you to level 20 as fast as possible.With the new update coming in the packs will cost more for less cards, and the much needed faction packs will be un-accessible to all players who don’t or can't spend real world money. Maybe with the lowered wins to prizes of draft that they proposed the game might be playable but i doubt that heavily.			"

								Got to say, I downloaded this on a whim (the usual logic ""free is a great price"") not expecting much and now, I'm hooked. Ive played quite a few TCGs including big names like Magic the Gathering and such and this beats all hands down, in every category. Mechanics wise, it's more tactical and in depth than any other TCG ive played and the game modes have everything you expect and a few original ones that are brilliant. Regarding the usual fears of Free-to-Play = Pay-to-Win, I've not spent a penny on it as yet and dont feel penalised at all for that. They game hands out cards reguarly and in all fairness used correctly common cards can be just as effective as rare or epic ones. I may just end up spending a little cash on this game as I feel that the dev's deserve it! Also this game features zombies and jetpacks. Nuff said			"

												This is a solid online TCG for any TCG fan.  If you like MTG but are looking for something similar but different enough to feel fresh, this is the game for you.  PROS:*There is a great variety of factions, each with their own unique theme and play style.*The animated card art is spectacular.*Battlefields and avatars can be bought with either real-life money or in-game currency for personalization.*The game mechanics themselves are innovative.  I especially like the Commander concept.*Mixing and matching factions and commanders really brings a lot of depth to deckbuilding.*Speaking of deckbuilding, the deck building UI is easy to understand and user-friendly.CONS:*Match-making for PvP is... spotty.  There is an option to match with other new players, but you'll be waiting a while because...*The community right now is made up of a lot of veteran players who have a metric ton of cards and run over newer players, making the barrier of entry for competitive play rather high.  You'll be losing a LOT trying to build up a base of cards without spending real-life money.  This game definitely isn't Pay To Win, because you can win with free cards, but you really have to be skilled or devote a lot of time into the game to do it.*Speaking of building up a card base, you're only really guaranteed enough cards to build a deck with four factions playing through the single-player campaign.  If you want a deck with the other four, you'll have to put in that time and/or money.Overall the positives greatly outweigh the negatives and I would recommend this game to anyone, but especially TCG fans of any kind.  This game could really use more people in the community, and with the new expansion out and the meta potentially changing with it, now is as good a time as any to get in on the action. "

												As many people have already pointed out, the main problem is a low playerbase and a poor company. This leads to many bugs and the client crashing somewhat often, as well this leads to that it can take quite a while to find a match with somebody. And if you find a match, the server just might be so desprate to pair you with someone that they match you up against someone much better than you.However, the rest of the game is amazing. The animated art for the cards are badass and really convey the feeling of whatever character/faction they are, the game is fairly balanced (although the sleepers faction has gotten ♥♥♥♥ed over quite a bit in the past, much to my dismay).There are a lot of diffrent cards with diffrent effects that allow for plenty of theory crafting. And if you do not like creating your own deck ideas and combos, every week there is a rotating array of free decks for new players who don't have real decks or for people looking for inspiration for their own decks.Also, even if you do face mostly the main stream decks (well, as main stream as they can get with such a low player base i geuss), you do also face quite a bit of unique decks, or at least less main stream decks. The game has never really been as broken as MTG has been at some points where there is like only a few decks that work and all the rest are just trash.The game also has a fairly unique deck building system where comanders take a big, big part as they directly alter what cards you can even have in your deck. Its also quite fast pace. Certain decks like a red charge deck will either have won or will start losing by around turn 6. Also, turns are done at the same time as your opponent. This means that everything you do has to be proactive instead of reactive. If you want to counter a spell, then you have to predict that your opponent is going to use that spell this turn, and use it this turn, before they actually cast it. This does lead to a format where control decks are not quite as oppresive since you can't just auto-counter everything another player does, you have to predict their actions and not just blindy counter, as well as create a mind game. I can't tell you how many times i have been sitting on that last turn. Both players are just a hit from death, and i have to predict exactly what they are going to do. Because of how combat works, you dont directly decide who battles who, rather every creatures does battle with the next one in line untill there are no more attackers or there are no more creatures to attack and they deal dmg to the enemy player.All in all, this is a great card trading game, that is actually free isntead of freemium may i add. This game is a lot like league of legends in this aspect. U can get every single card in the game. no matter how strong just by playing the game. Get it now.			"

												One reason why should not play this game. There is this bug called 'de-sync' that some are exploiting to exploit out a buff multiple times when it should only proc once. You WILL lose if it comes to this. No amount of skill can help you. Yes he might not win, but you will lose. This is most annoying when it comes to rift runs. When he is losing one can exploit and then you will just have lost due to a major flaw that has persisted in the game for a long time.

												In a world where games such as Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering are gaining publicity, it's nice to take a look at one of the lesser known games. Infinity Wars, in my opinion, is a phenomenal game. The strategy needed to play well, the aesthetics of the playing field and cards, and the overall flow of the game just feel natural to me. I will admit, it was somewhat difficult to understand at first, but that's somewhat understandable. However, after playing with the game a bit, crafting a deck, and playing around in the different modes, I was hooked. One of the most important things to do if you want to learn how to play this game well is to do the puzzles that the game has provided. Not only can they provide you with prizes after beating them, but they also give you tips and tricks as to more advanced plays that you can incorporate into your own play style. If I could make one criticism, it's that it is somewhat difficult to accumulate in-game currency to purchase card pack or decks, especially since the developers rarely, if ever, give out premium currency for free. However, at this point, I'm just nitpicking. So, to conclude, this game is great once you understand it, and I hope that whoever's reading this will pick up the game and have an infinitely good time.			"

												let me say this game is amazing and more origanl than other card games. But the learning curbe is HUGE and i mean huge the campaign can help but there are so many cards with diffrent effects its hard to correctly build decks. The pvp is filled with dedicated players i have played 13 pvp games all were against people who had gold medels in pvp(you earn medals if you win games in pvp). I won 3 of the 13 games 6 were against the same guy. But that is the part that makes me not intressed in this game i want to be but with every game i see so many cards i dont understand or how to deal with. getting the money for packs is a very difficult task cause it take a a lot of games to get. In pvp i got about 300 from about 5 games i need 5000 to buy a usful pack there are 1000 packs but those are if you are still starting and need filler cards not cards to make a deck work properly. If a few parts of the games were tweeked this would be a great card game. It is a great one now but its not at a point of my constantly going on excited to play again			"

								If you are looking for Online Trading Card Game. Then I  strongly recommend you to give Infinity Wars a try. This game involves strategy and preempt what your opponent strategy is planning and counter it with your own. Though still in BETA, i am already immersed by the game play. The cards are all animated and the artwork on the cards are beautifully done.The campaign teaches you how to play with different fractions and while learning about how different fractions works. By the end of each campaign, you get a set of basic core cards to start your deck. If you wish to improve your deck, you can get free booster pack by leveling. Win or lose, you still get experience points and infinity points to redeem more boosters!! Finish the campaign and you will rougly know how this game work..Though there are some minon bugs and glitches, I am pretty sure the developers are working to fixed them. Even thought its still BETA, I am confident this game will be fun and addictive to all TCG players. Especially opening of booster packs!. I have invested some money to purchase boosters/support this game and to satisfy my urge to open booster packs.This is my 1st and only sincere product review I haven writen in my life, no I am not paid to do this. This game is really good. Just have to fix the Overused Ritual Master and it will be perfect!  "

												Been playing Magic The Gathering for a long time.  If you, like me, love strategic fantasy card games, you will probably spend hours playing this fun game too.  The gameplay, balanced factions, and tutorials are all there and high quality, and this game is FREE!.  You can pick from the undead type faction, the beasties, the mechs, the angels, the demons, the defenders, the fast attack warriors, and the nuker wizards types (not their 'in game' names).  There are also some interesting choices everyone can use from a large pool of neutral cards too.  The factions are creatively themed, like the defenders have a water samurai vibe going.It really gets interesting because you can combine up to 3 factions in any one deck.  This game is full of mechanics that add to the player's satisfaction.  For example, when you make a deck, you pick 3  commanders that can be any creature card and you start the game with those 3 cards in play, in a designated area.  So your awesome 3 best legendary creaturecards that you got lucky and drew from booster decks? Yeah, you start every game with those.And as if satisfying deep strategic choices are not enough, the developers added very impressive artwork for each card!  Honestly I enjoy all the beautiful artwork almost as much as the gameplay.  And if unique fantasy artwork isn't enough, the artwork is also animated!You unlock plenty of cards playing through the campaign, which includes 8 missions for each faction.  Also quests unlock you cards.  Wins and losses generate you in game points which can buy boosters too.  Also playing games gives you experience, and at the time of writing this I think you get a booster for every level you gain.  So it does not feel as griindy as say, Hearthstone.I would recommend this game even if it costed money.  But is doesn't.  So pick it up and go have fun.edit: wanted to add, played this game over 150 hrs, new patch coming soon, and I haven't changed my mind.  This game is good!			"

												The best Trading Card Game in any medium, period. A blend of traditional TCG with features only available in the digital medium to achieve a depth of tactics and strategy that is simply unparralled. Add in that this game is ridiculously affordable for a TCG and can be played for free while still amassing a large card collection. Magic definitely has richer, deeper, card library (as is to be expected) but in the playing of the game the tactical choices are both more numerable and more impactful. Out is the feeling of being beat by a more expensive deck or being screwed by a bad mana draw. In is the feeling that strong choices can overcome better decks or bad draws. Hearthstone has a super polished presentation and fantasic developer but after that Infinity War has it beat on every front. So much so that there really is no reason to compare the two, it is like checkers and chess. I compare it to Hearthstone because the developer support has been Infinity Wars' biggest issue.Infinity Wars' had a fatal flaw, however. The developers had begun a game they lacked the resources to maintain and grow. The bug list was/is extensive. Many promised features had been shelved. The game seemed to have been abandoned and the player count began to decay. I stopped playing for months at a time. I would not have recommended investing in this game at all but everything has changed.  A new partnership has been announced (information on the game's forums) and suddenly this game has surged forward again. The main bugs are being tackled and a new plan to relaunch the game is underway. Players are returning and optimism is high. This game is a gem. It is the best TCG I've played and every replacement I've looked for since has left me unfulfilled. While the game still needs a lot of polish and improvment, the new injection of engery and resources from the developers has my hopes high. Try it for free. Play the rather basic campaign mode. Trial some of the free decks in pvp. I think a lot of you will agree: This is the best puffy TCG ever made.			"

												I WANT to like this game. Honest, I do.But after playing for a few weeks, I kind of want to quit.PROS- It really is free-to-play; yes, you can spend money if you like to more quickly get what others can earn through play, but it is by no means required. And the people who plunk down money won't necessarily get what they want; you buy booster packs in the game store, and it's random what cards you'll receive. You could spend tons of money, but it may never get you the cards you're after.- Um...it's a very pretty game?CONS- The learning curve isn't very high...but the deck-building curve is. Unless you spend lots of money right up front, you'll lose. A lot. for at least a week or two. Once you start earning enough points to start getting new decks, you can build something worth playing that might actually win.- The game is severaly unbalanced. There are certain card-factions (and you have to choose from the various factions; you can't build a deck with just any card you like) that will simply run roughshod over others. There are cards that cost far too little to play that either generate tons of creatures all at once or make creatures flying which makes them very difficult to block or kill. Unless you build a deck specifically to counter these effects--and you have no idea if your opponent will be playing a deck you need to counter in this way--you might as well concede every match right away when you see one. Angel decks and undead decks are the worst for this.The game is far too often either no challenge at all or unwinnable; there is very little in-between.- Unless you do a lot of trading with other players, it is very difficult to get certain cards. I've been playing for weeks and while there are cards you see during the tutorials, they've never come up when I've purchased a booster pack. Getting new cards is more often than not a lot of been-there-done-that.- The interface has a tendency to be quite clunky, especially the chat windows. If you accidentally close a chat window with another player while playing, I've found no way to re-open it. If you want to communicate with another playing after a match is finished, you'd better start typing to them before you go back to the main menu or the chat box will disappear....though there isn't a lot to chat about, anyway; most players will just throw internet abbreviations at you rather than speaking English (""gg"" is most common), so it's very difficult to build any kind of community or get to know anybody you're playing matches against.- The time between rounds during the game, the planning stage, can seem to drag on and on. You've finished playing your cards and you're waiting for the other player to finish planning...but it seems as though they've either gone to the can of AFK in some other fashion, or they're reading the text of the cards AGAIN (even though they should probably be familiar with their own deck), or maybe the server is delayed...you've never sure which. But it gets to the point where shouting, ""Oh, come on!"" at the screen starts to feel quite reasonable.So, basically, while there is a lot of potential to this game, it has a lot of flaws that eventually makes playing more stressful and frustrating than fun.

												I have been playing this game off and on for a little over a year now. I really enjoy it every time I log in, and the devs are always looking to update and improve the game and player experience. I personally love the simultaneous turns and the wide potential variety in deck types with the 9 different factions combined with 3 tiers of purity.The fact that you get IP (the free in-game currency) regardless of winning or losing (of course you get more if you win) really helps out newer players. They also offer about 4-5 pretty solid free decks a week that rotate out for new decks every week.The only complaints I've heard (which I personally disagree with, but want to include in the interest of thoroughness) are that the user interface is a little too action-packed, and that there is a lot of dragging involved. Neither of these things should prevent you fro at least trying this totally free to play game.It truly is F2P. from the free weekly decks to the free packs while levelling and the daily missions. This game is quite friendly to new players wanting to get started in a new and unique card game. Unlike hearthstone, this game actually has a trading mechanism that players can use to trade amongst each other.This game does have a smaller player base than something like hearthstone, but I've never had a bad wait time when I want to play. there is a world chat option too so if you have questions you can ask the community in real time which is fantastic.

												20+ years of experience with a wide range of TCGs, and this one shines compared to any of the dozens I could compare it to. The mechanics are familiar and easily learned, but the depth of strategy and mind game elements of the simultaneous turn is a welcome innovation. The cards are well balanced and attractive if simply animated, and acquisition is fair if a bit grindy. The excitement of opening a new pack as real as a physical TCG. The factions and commander system in which you combine them provide lots of variety from game to game and deck to deck, as well as each faction having plenty of its own character. The playerbase is far smaller than the quality deserves, but friendly and non-toxic as a whole, and especially for online pvp. The queue times are a begrudging criticism, but the pve campaign is frequently improved and expanded, and can still offer some challenge and progress towards acquiring cards. I begrudgingly admit its not without faults. The queue times and matchmaking suffer from a lack of players, and there are bugs that sometimes persist over several patches. The core gameplay is so fresh and charming even to a veteran card flopper it's worth forgiveness for its flaws.			"

												It's a pretty fun game. I've had quite a bit of fun playing it. Normally no issues. The only issue seems to be lag when you or your opponent has 100 cards in deck. Also the DEV team don't seem to care about the game or players. I have not been able to play for a while and i got a new computer. So i downloaded the game and tried to play. But I get stuck at the load screen. I can't find anything on the issue and the DEV team don't seem to want to help in the issue. Other than that it is a great game. It takes paciance and practice and research to get a proper deck going. Don't listen to the guys saying its a pay to play game cause most of the top players are Free 2 Play players.			"

												Well, i dont want to type here something too long and difficult to read.Simply, It is one of the best TCG...I have played Hearthstone, magic the gathering and few others..As different than othen Hearthstone there are 3 zones in game. Attack, Defense and support You can swap the position of your minions every turn. This adds the game more strategyThere are Lots of factions and cardsIts not pay to win, players can collect the cards by1 - daily login reward2 - daily missions3 - credits earned by matches wonIf you guys like to play TCG, MUST try this one.

												Back in Febraury 2014, I came into the game and never stopped playing.  Over the months, many changes happened, and this year, I have seen a lot of less players than usual.  It is beginning to take a long time to get into a game since no one is around anymore.  I am going to tell you the good sides of this game when players are on.Good parts of this game if players actually play the game.-Of course, less time-taking on finding a game.-More ideas from feedback.-Better chance of finding glitches that everyone hates, which contributes to the hate of this game.-The trading community would be more thriving.-Less chance of a new player competing against a Pay-to-Win player with major experience.-An overall strong community.-More interesting features and updates would have greater appreciation.-More people could help new players entering the game.Summer 2014-The Ascension update comes out with a whole new faction to play around.  The Overseers, one of the most game-changing factions.  Hundreds of new players were around and everything was just great, until the new faction was too overpowered for everyone to handle (Try out my old 2014 rebellion deck, which completly devastated the overseers).  Soon, since there were so many players complaining about this problem, the creators got the message quickly and balanced the faction when Order came out.Here are some of the bad things in this game.-Pay to Win (Mainly because only the Pay-to-Win players still play the game).-In-game issues, causing both players to sometimes immediatly get kicked off the game.-The shop.-Takes too long to find a game.-The uncommons are more powerful than rares.To make this game better, everyone interested in Trading Card Games should give it a try, which could make a whole lot of new players joining the game, concluding in the increase of gameplay and feedback.  I rate this game 10/10 in 2014 and 8/10 on present day.			"

												I've been playing Infinity Wars for about a week and 34 hours already! Can't even help myself. My first card game was Pokemon but let's face it, they just looked pretty. The game sucked. Yu-Gi-Oh! is first love But Konami killed it a while ago. The only way I've been able to get my card game fix is playing old GBA/Vita games. I played Magic for about a year. The game is deep and I respect the hell out of it but the lore didn't grab me. I didn't find myself invested in the cards. Hearthstone is fun but I needed something deeper.This game caught my attention a while ago but my Steam back list for games is..I'm sure you know all too well. It's a free to play game but I saw the content on sale so I decided to check it out to see if it was worth it. First of all, it is definitely not pay to win. It's git gud to win. A week in and you get a lot of cards through campaign mode and leveling u. I lucked out because I got some pretty awesome rare and epic cards. I've been getting better at deck building. I was getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked this morning and then I threw a deck together with the few factionless cards I have. I didn't have enough to make a factionless deck, so I combined it with the Dawn faction (or whatever its called) Took it for a test run, it drained my morale. I keep forgetting about morale. So I combine it with Genesis. Low morale costs and power up items. I am 7-2 with this deck as of now. My first lost taught me how to use the deck better. The 2nd loss showed me that I need more cards for this build. But still not bad for using cards given to you for free.But tomorrow is pay day and I'm definitely giving this game my money. I can already see myself putting 1000s of hours in. Some people say the content is over priced. But they put in all the hard work and released the game for free. Given you a method to play competitively without spending a dime. Even if you lose you still level up and get points. They have every right to price their content at whatever they like. I'm buying all of the items on sale but I'm buying 1 at full price. I think it's completely worth it for all the time I know I will put in it. But it will be the one and only time. After this I'm waiting for sales to come around again.			"

												Infinity Wars is a very good Trading Card Game, complete with animations for all the cards and a unique, sort of M:TG-light feel. It has a fully realized backstory, voice acting in the campaign, and some lovely art.-Sound: 7/10 The sounds and music in the game are vibrant, although the music could do with some more variation. The obvious sound for a match being made is a great boon to those of us who alt-tab out during the interminable waiting times between matches.-Gameplay: 4/10 The actual cardgame mechanics are well done, built to be quick, accessible, and with a surprising amount of depth. The tutorial explains things very well, and the game gives you several starter decks for completing the campaign mode. You're given more cards for winning many matches and leveling up. It should be a fun game! This is ruined by a terrible matchmaking process, pay-2-win kiddies, and ranked play being restricted until you have essentially put hundreds of hours into the game. At the time of this writing I am level 19, with something like three hundred matches against other players, with another two hundred or so against bots. I am not yet high enough to play in the ranked matches.-Graphics: 5/5 Graphics, to me, have a lower impact on my total review score as I do not need ULTRA GRAFIKS to enjoy a videogame. Considering that it is a card game, though, Infinity Wars has lush graphics, with 3d effects for the battlefield and animations for all of the cards in the game. I almost wanted to keep collecting cards simply to see what the animations were for every card. They range the gamut from beautiful, to amusing, to even touching.-Replayability: 2/10 This is a big sticking point with me. Normally, a card game like Infinity Wars would, theoretically, have a much higher replayability rating, but the matchmaking service is just, just awful. There's no level-tied matches and it is ENTIRELY possible and MORE THAN likely that your level 2 using a starter deck can, and will, face a level 50 player using only cards he spent real money on. I have also waited more than ten minutes for a match, and no one wants that.-Cheese -5/-5  Cheese is a special rating for me. It's a sign of how much the game is, for me at least, ruined by the Cash Shop. There are some games, like Rust, where the Cash Shop is only for cosmetic items. This game is completely broken by the cash shop. For about 20 USD, you have enough of their premium currency (Did I mention the premium currency? No? Well it's there. BIG TIME) to afford several store decks and booster packs. It completely wrecks the balance.Total Score: 13/30 I cannot recommend this game. Although there is fun to be had, and I really do enjoy the gameplay, the overwhelming presence of the cash shop, horrible matchmaking, premium currency, and lack of any coherent system for tiered matches ruin it. Do not pick up this game, unless you can stomach either playing against bots, spending real money on digital cards for a 'free' game, or being beaten constantly.			"

												One of the better card games i have played so far.  I'm just gonna list the Pro's & Cons.+Pro's> Card's look really nice and are well animated.> Both players play their moves at the same time so it's alot of strategy and trying to bait or outwit your opponent.> Can play against bots to lvl up and gain the IP currency although PvP hands out more.> Friendly/helpful playerbase.-Con's> It's not super popular.> Sometimes Queue takes a bit longer than usual to match you with someone in PvP, however that usually depends on what type of match your doing and the time of the day.Other than that i would recommend this game.

												Generally great game, but personally, pushed me away!Since turns are solved simultaneously, there is a lot of psychology and unpredictableness involved, which means, that you can never be sure if your strategies are going to work, which i dislike greatly...Additionaly, rewards for winning are bad to a degree that id almost call them shabby, the learning curve is extremely high and cards are very extreme, and especially the rare ones, which means, that it is generally hard to keep the control, and that new players dont stand the very least chance in ranked (including the free decks), and wont for a long time if they dont spend much money!

												So, i havent played this in like 2 years...  But with it apparently being 'reborn'  ill throw this down: This is the single best TCG/CCG ever made.    Its depth of strategy and tactics (deck preparation and card usage/timing) is fantastic.    Back when I was playing it hardcore (Pre-star Trek release) I was in the top 100, and held my own, but wasnt one of the 'greats'  like... sadpanda?   Boxbear?   I cant remember the names of the guys who were on top.   But they were great.  I got super into the community.  This was the first and only game that actually drew me to twitch.   Im sure the original IW twitchers have moved on, but nexustavern, blue...whatever, and that one guy who went insane and ragequit were always fun. lol. The reason youve never played this game or heard of it, is because blizzard came out with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ card game which is easier and appeals to shallow morons.    *shrug*  My opinion.   Maybe you think its great.   And maybe I think yer a snowflake.			"

												Seriously amazing card game. I checked it out last week and have been completely absorbed ever since by its amazing draft mode. You will like this game if you agree with the following:- Games like Magic: TG but with added complexity- Great and varied deck tactics without a steep learning curve- Deckbuiling and especially drafting a deck out of a limited card pool- Card games with adult-oriented, stunning visuals (Hearthstone is a joke in comparison)- Good gameplay balanceI honestly hope the devs keep up the good work and won't let this game end up the same way Duel of Champions did (because, seriously, f*** Ubisoft).

												As you can see by my hours I have put a lot of attempt to like this game.I've played for over a year and throughout my experience I have noticed constant bugs.These bugs often don't get fixed and even more bugs surface later. Constant crashing or certain menus overlapping making you unable to take a turn can make the game impossible to play.This along with the lack of balance that it seems to love makes the game hard to love.There are better card games on steam for free. I'd recommend those over this.			"

								Infinity Wars is a very similar to game to Magic: The Gathering. So if you enjoyed the latter then this game is for you. Infinity Wars is a great game with a huge amount of depth and versatility which takes trading card games to the next level.The game has great deck ideas, card animations (each have their own effect animations), wide variety of factions which allows different playing styles. This is one of the greatest trading card games on the market and should be tried by every fan of the genre. Not to mention the free to play model is fair and you can legitimately be a competitive player with no investment.			"

								I've managed to pick up a lot of impressions of this game due to a livestreaming event that several big streamers had participated in a long while ago. I was almost instantly hooked on the art style and its immersiveness compared to collectible card games. In retrospect, I do not regret spending my time in this game and I'm really looking forward to what it has to offer. As for a background: I had no TCG experience, but the tutorials back then were already alright, so it was no biggie getting into this game rather quickly. In my opinion there were no such thing as overly complicated card descriptions and most cards right off the bat would be easily recognizable. So yeah. Clearly recommending it! <3			"

												It's all right, but you're better off spending your money on a real TCG. The campaign is fun, interesting, and teaches you card mechanics and game rules pretty well. Deckbuilding has been done a lot better. For example, I'm not sure how they can consider this a ""Trading Card Game"" when there is no actual trading. Unless they only count you ""trading"" your money for their in game booster packs. If thats the case than this is a ""Buying Card Game."" There is a collectible card RTS called Battleforge where you can buy boosters using bought currency, but can also trade with other players in an in game auction house, even with earned in game currency. I only met one person during PVP, a Russian guy who asked me to play faster. Which considering it was my first and only pvp battle I thought this was very rude.			"

												Oh boy, where do I start?First off, this game is one of the better (if not best) iTCGs I have played. The cards are all animated which is a nice touch seeing most other iTCGs don't do that. The game is solid and challenging. It definatly requires a bit of thinking and strategy. One of the features that I absolutly love is the fact both players take their turns at the same time. It keeps the game a little more fast paced and requires you to bluff, call bluffs, and think ahead a few moves. There are a lot of unique factions each with their own play style. You can also mix and match factions to create a play style to suit yours. This keeps things refreshing and it is always fun seeing what you can do to get an edge of your opponent. And the best part about this game? IT'S FREE!!!! No pay-to-win. You can get every card for free, either from buying them with the in-game currency or by getting an achievment. And let me tell you, there are a lot. This game just seems to throw cards at you. Completing the campaign gives you a HUGE arsenal to make a deck.TL;DR Infinity Wars 2014 is a solid, truly free game that has a lot of unique mechanics not often seen in iTCGs.10/10 Would recommend			"

												I've enjoyed this game more then Hearthstone, Magic, or any other trading card game I've played yet. There is a different feel to the game that seperates it from the rest. Just give it a try, play through the entire campaign, up until you have a good feel for each faction, and decide whether you like it or not.A few downsides...- A little bit hard and annoying to get in-game money.- Still a work-in-progress but that's understandable.- Some annoying people in PvP who like to lag.- Limited gamemodes as of right now.The upsides...- A unique feel from the rest of TGCs.- Plenty of choices that suit your game style.- Requires more in-depth strategy rather then just having better (rare) cards.- A rather enjoyable campain that gives you a feel for all factions.- Wonderful and enjoyable artwork to look at. Each new card is blast just to see the pictures.Just give it a try if you enjoy TCGs or want to know how they are played.			"

												Fantastic game. A must try for everyone. Edit June 2015 : After I don't know how long in development, the cards are exactly the same. There is no new content and everything has stagnated since I first tried it in alpha. It has good potential but it's stuck in the early stages.PROS1. A Simultaneous Action System Players play their cards and actions at the SAME time. 2. Morale system is interesting. It provides another way to poke at an enemy, although ""Deal One Damage (DOD)"" to a life pool would be just as effective. Currently, morale is only designed for defensive play.3. Command, Support, Assault, Defense zones provide variety of play. Command provides a commander zone that cannot be directly attacked. It is similar to the Heroes concept in other Trading Card Games. The only difference in Infinity Wars is that commanders are expendable in this game. Support provides an area for troops to get buffed/choose the right timing to appear. This is a fantastic idea as it improves the efficiency of resource spending e.g. summon a pair of 3 costs creatures one turn after another but bringing them to the battlefield on the same turn together.Defense and Assault zones help with tactical movement. Unit order affects how efficiently you use your tropps. You can even swap troops between zones. Even simple actions such as choosing who goes first is important.4. Trade SystemTrading system is fantastic. As compared to other online TCG games which do not provide a trading system to maximize profit e.g. MMDOC, Hearthstone. This is a great boon to players who play Infinity Wars. +++CONS1. Too few combinations. Most of the cards follow specific themes so strategies are quite stagnant e.g. mass zerging, death leveling, evolution. 2. Massive Repetition/Reskin of Cards You will notice that each race has a key unit which is repeated for all the decks. e.g. Demonic Disciple for Exiles, Invincible Defender for Descents of the Dragons, Endless Horde for the Sleepers, Undending Drones for Genesis, Verore Death Worshipper for Verore, One of Many for Warpath3. No Hidden/Trap cards.Speaks for itself4. Alpha GraphicsThe game is still in alpha mode so there are many problems with the graphics. E.g. Spell targetting a card uses an ugly red crosshair. Few minor graphic problems e.g. Using Great Wall partially covers the view of the left most card. Rewards for campaigns have no image, Flame Dawn 4 just a ""loading image"" text. Rewards still can be collected. Opening rewards are very slow.5. Verification of TargetThere is no verification of the target for certain spells e.g. Assasinate. You have to remember which card you clicked on. This makes it very difficult for multiple spells as you will not want mistakenly casting 2 spells on the same card. 6. Half-finished campaign. You will notice that a few stages of a campaign tend to be repetitive.7. Boring AnimationsCard animations do not really add to the game. Mostly ""hand waving"".SUGGESTIONS1. Mobile MarketConnect the PC game with the mobile market. An online TCG would be better served on Iphones, Ipads plus PCs.			"

												The card game itself is pretty excellent from a design perspective, which itself is quite a feat when it comes to electronic card games. Most of them are just tacked on after a terrible exploitative business model. It's better than games such as Magic the Gathering or Pokemon as it leaves open much more strategy and bluffing. However, like all e-card games, it has a terribly exploitative business model where the idea is to frustrate the player as hard as possible into buying packs. This comes in the following forms:-You earn packs as you ""level up"" and complete campaigns. However, all these cards are locked from trading. This means they're useless unless they go in a workable deck for you personally. ""Binds on equip""-style crap has bee cancerous since it was invented and needs to stop.-The conversion rate (in AUS dollars) for pack prices puts them at the same per-pack price and sometimes slightly higher than popular TCGs when purchased by the box. Anyone familiar with TCGs will know what I mean here. For everyone else, just know that in-game currency and real life money to spend on packs is heavily skewed out of your favor. Even with a fast deck, it takes 50 games to earn one pack of 15 cards.-The absolute monotonous grind. How would I know, given that I only have 4 hours on record? I watched my girlfriend play this game for 40 straight hours and her collection is still small, and of that maybe a tiny fraction is tradable. As tradable cards are only gotten through packs you buy expensively with real money or grind forever in-game.-The new patch is going to make it even MORE grindy by lowering the initial pack cost a small percentage then dropping it from 15 cards to 5. Each card was previously worth 350 ingame currency on average but will now cost 600 currency on average. Screw that garbage.In short, it's just a time sink like every other e-card game. I hope a competent company buys out the IP and fixes most of its business model problems. That, or I hope they make this an actual physical card game which can be done easily with a few tweaks.I haven't even mentioned how glitchy the client is. Their garbage collection algorithm isn't worth crap as graphical elements from windows you accessed previously carry over sometimes to new windows which makes annoying artifacts.			"

												Infinity Wars is a pretty cool and quite unique entry in the recent digital CCG boom. It requires some really deep strategy decisions about when to attack or defend, and you have a lot of control over how you want to maneuver your troops around the battlefield. One of the interesting things about these strategy choices is that Infinity Wars has figured out how to solve one of the big drawbacks to digital CCGs: player interaction. In physical card games like Magic, player interaction is quick and easy; you perform an action and then I can quickly respond by saying, “okay, before that resolves, I do this.” When it comes to digital card games, those interactions can be hard to implement. What was easy and took two seconds in real life can be digitally dragged out through a series of prompts and pop-up boxes. Digital CCGs have dealt with this in different ways…Hex: Shards of Fate tries its best but is ultimately just awkward and clunky, while Hearthstone gets rid of this sort of player interaction altogether. Infinity Wars’ solution is simultaneous reveal, which is a *perfect* choice. This means that the game can have Magic-style tricks like surprising your opponent with a Giant Growth, or giving one of your characters Flying at the last second. You need to think hard about what your opponent might do, how he or she will move troops around, what buffs or removal cards he or she might have access to, etc.The other big feature that Infinity Wars brings to digital CCGs is deck-building complexity. In Hearthstone or Shadowverse or most other digital CCGs, a given deck is always tied to a certain class and its card pool. If I want to make a Warlock deck, I only have access to Warlock and neutral cards. This is really restrictive, but it’s also very friendly to new players or to anyone who just wants to play casually. You don’t need to lose sleep over possible card interactions – there are only a few cards to choose from, and you get to know them pretty quickly. In Infinity Wars, however, deck-building is truly opened up. You create a deck by choosing three Commanders, and each Commander can be from a different faction. You can mix and match all sorts of cards and create really crazy and creative combos. This does mean, however, that the deck-building experience is kind of overwhelming and hard to master. There are so many options that you can't really take a casual approach. Many people will see this as a huge draw, but I can see some players feeling daunted. You have to be open to the fact that the process is going to be a little unintuitive and hard to crack at first. I think that if you're eager to get your hands dirty with some creative and messy deck-building ideas, you'll be in heaven with Infinity Wars.The theme of the game is definitely compelling and neat…it has a strong sci-fi bent to it, which I tend to prefer over high fantasy. The factions include a Warhammer 40K-style military, a robot-building corporation, dark magic users, and tech-angels with Uzis. You'll be able to cast demons, mutant animals, giant robots, siege cannons, assassins, and psychics. In a way, the game’s theme kind of reminds me of a CCG from the 90s called Shadowfist (if you’ve never played this, check it out). Shadowfist also had factions of pulp heroes and sci-fi warriors battling for control of rifts and secret portals, and Infinity Wars shares its weird and kitschy sense of humor. Infinity Wars’ theme really shines through its animated cards: characters eternally fly through the battlefield, stomping enemies, and cities blow up over and over in cycles of never-ending destruction. It makes you feel like every card is rare and special. The art itself is a little hit and miss, though. Some cards are beautifully drawn and some are sub-DeviantArt stuff. Looking at the recent Rebellion set, Lilariah the angel and the Martyr of Death demon are awesome, but Lucca, Rebellion Leader...the foreshortening on that raised arm, yeesh.While I’m absolutely recommending Infinity Wars to anyone interested in CCGs, I do have a few critiques that bring down the game’s overall quality. The whole package is actually a bit buggy and sluggish. The interface is just clunky and hard to navigate, and it froze up on me a few times. It was difficult to play Infinity Wars after playing Shadowverse...even though Shadowverse was originally a mobile game, the interface runs like butter at all times, and Infinity Wars feels amateurish in comparison. Secondly, the player base seems a little small, so it can take a while to find a game (when you do find a game, however, the netcode is pretty decent). Finally, Infinity Wars is quite stingy about packs. You get packs whenever you level up, which is great (I heard this ends after you hit a certain level, though...?), but otherwise it's quite a grind to earn in-game money. Not the biggest deal in the world, but if you want to get one of those nice pre-made decks, it's going to take you a good while.			"

												Honestly I really really REALLY like this game. But the match set up is horrible. If you're brand new and only just finished the campaigned, you get faced with people who will rip off your pants and ♥♥♥♥ you. Like relentlessly ♥♥♥♥ you. I have no idea how this system sets up the matchmaking, but apparently when you click an option making you fight people your level they have op decks. Although admittedly it's in some ways pay to win, you have many means to get good cards, as to which you recieve quite a few boosters in the campaign.I have played it all. Magic the gathering. Yu Gi Oh. Pokemon. Hearthstone. Vanguard. Weiss Swartz. All of these games have been fun, and half of them have online capabilities to play with others. And I really wanted this game to be an addition to that list.If anything, it's a fun game to play when you are ONLY facing off against AI. I have played 6-7 matches with ""People my level"" and got ♥♥♥♥ed 6/7 of the times.			"

												The game is a great card game, but unpolished.Keep waiting for the developers to tie things together.I have faith in them. Their implementation lacks on the marketing and the balancing department, UI and bugs.The core mechanics, flow of the game and all the things that make a card game good are already there.Again, just needs polish.Games like Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, Hearthstone and more recently Duelyst and Shadowverse offer a fierce competition to the TCG genre.This game is definitely on my watch list, and I will keep revisiting it, year after year.And you should too. It's a lot of fun.			"

												fake hype about linux. not impressed. not impressed at all. and to those saying linux makes up 1% of the gaming community, its those lazy developers faults. honestly, making a game is difficult, but what makes a game harder? getting it availible on a platform at a LATER time. reason for this is you have to catch up to all the patches, and everything gets more confusing to say the least. Im not saying the developers of this game are lazy, i have seen the game after all, i just think they should take some time and focus some of the development for the linux version. People already love the game, so if a game changer has to wait, i think its safe to say its best if anyone can play the new release. plus if memory serves me correctly, this runs off java and some unity. guess what? those both run on linux! 2/10. if i was developing a game, i wouldnt leave a platform behind, not even in beta testing. thank you, and once this gets a linux release, ill change my review.

												Infinity Wars - Animated Trading Card GameIcy's Score: 5.2Title: Infinity Wars - Animated Trading Card GameDeveloper: Lightmare StudiosCategory: CardRating: NOT RATEDCompatibilty: Windows, MacPrice: FREE Gameplay:Look at the gameplay video above for more info (made by MMOBomb), but this game is a Trading Card Game like Hearthstone. And I first thought this when I first played but this game has its own distinct feel. First of all, you have cards, every turn you get usage point. You start off with 1 which you get less powerful cards but each turn goes up by 1 so soon enough you will have very powerful cards but like all card games, its all about setting a foundation. The board is set up in 2 areas: The left is your defense zone (or your opponents attack zone), you put cards there to stop your opponents from killing you but if you don't put any cards there to stop your opponent you will get hurt. The right is your attack zone (or your opponents defense zone), its the opposite of your defense zone. If you put cards there you will fight the other opponents cards but if your opponents cards aren't there then you hit the player if you get its HP to 0, you win.  Graphics:As the title says, this game is animated. And the animation is pretty nice, it has its distinct feel and fits this sci-fi atmosphere. I like it, definately when the cards have a little clip in them. Controls & Smoothness:The whole game uses the mouse, you  drag cards out but I found that you have to drag the cards out precisely it won't work. Music & Sound:The sound effects are pretty nice though I find a huge lack in music variety and nothing stood out. Difficulty:I found that the campaign was very limited to its playstile. As this is a card game, everybody plays the game differently but if you want to pass it you have to be full on offense and no defence if you want to pass the campaign. Which I found very annoying as your meant to develop your own playstyle. Fun Level:I found this game fun when you were playing your own way which was really fun but the campaign would throw away a lot of players as there is only one type of style to beat it. In conclusion, this game is great and really has a twist on the card genre, but until they can fix the muddled campaign, its hard to recommend this. Pro's:- Nice animations- Free- A nice twist on the card genre makes the gameplay awesome Con's:- Awful and muddled campaign- Lacking soundtrack Score: 5.2			"

												First off - Ignore everyone saying this game is pay to win. The top ranked player is F2P. That said, it is going to take a little bit of patience to get into the game until you have a decent set of cards, but most deck stapbles are going to be commons/uncommons with the occational rare tossed in. Epics/Legendaries are nice but you don't ABSOLUTELY need them until you're reaching near the top 10 of the leaderboards.Moving onto the difficulty for newbies. I'm not going to lie, there is a HUGE skill curve right now as many of the people playing the game are more experienced veterans who generally speaking are going to know what you are going to do before you. You are GOING to lose when you first start out. A LOT. I've been playing for about 2 years now and when I started out it took me probably the first 2 weeks to win consistantly. Its just the nature of the beast with simultaneous turns. You have to be able to predict what your opponent is going to be able to do and its very strategy intensive in that regard which is why people still play it.If you're looking to get into this game, now is the best time. A new set is about to come out which will fundamentally change the way the meta is played, and will screw with many experienced players expectations.  Pre-orders for the new set will be on their way soon after, allowing you to buy premium cards with in-game currency for SUBSTANTIAL trading power.Once you get the hang of this game though its one of, if not THE most rewarding and strategic TCG out there right now. It just needs a good following of new players to pick it up.			"

								Being an old MTG competitive player this game definitely peeked my interest. But I was still a bit skeptical b/c being from a company I had never heard of I was not sure if it was actually going to be another ""pay to win"" set up, for the more casual players. I was very happily proven wrong when it came to the ""pay to win"" scenario. A lot of times in TCG's the most difficult part is acquiring the more hard to get cards: Epic, Legendary, Mythic cards etc. Well what Infinity Wars does to help you acquire cards is give you a booster each time you level which is incredibly helpful, as well as offer an in game trading option with other players. Also for those of you that enjoy drafts, this game does it right. It is similar to MTGO and Hearthstone where as you pay a buy in to draft, but achieving the buy in amount is very easy to get. You could play against bots for half an hour or play in ranked matches, or even play with a friend to earn in game currency to quickly buy yourself into a draft. My favorite part about the drafts is you have a chance if you are successful enough to get your drafted deck for free, but you also have the option of purchasing the deck regardless of your success in the draft as well.For those Hardcore TCG gamers out there that want a competitive ranked ladder in either draft or constructed its here in this game. And yes even though it is still in the earlier stages it is very well thought out, and adds a very unique gameplay experience to turn based strategy. The community in this game is very interactive and friendly as well. The global chat within the game allows you to converse with other players about strategies, trading, and practice. Overall if you enjoy TCG's I highly reccomend ""Infinity Wars"". A very fun easy to enjoy gaming experience.			"

												This one has a lot of promise.It's a fairly traditional MTG-esque card game, but with some significant differences:  (1) turns are simultaneous;(2) you pick three characters from your deck to be 'commanders' (whose abilities you can use even if they aren't in play);  (3) there are three zones of play - attack, defence, and support. Attackers can only hit the opponent's defence zone, and vice versa. The support zone protects characters from most harm.(4) all movement between zones happens simultaneously with the other play - so you declarae attackers without knowing what the enemy will block with.These elements adds a huge amount of prediction and bluffing into the mix. Do you rush in with your unstoppable walrus in the hopes that they don't add more defenders, or do you move him off the battlefield to dodge a possible death ray? Do you cast Stumble on a character, knowing that if they don't attack, the spell will fizzle? Adding to that, players have both health *and* morale to worry about. Producing twenty cheap blockers may keep your fortress intact, but evey time one of your characters die, your team takes a hit to their morale - the more legendary the character, the bigger the hit. Some decks specialise on being so defensive that the opponent's attacks sap their own morale. Hit 0 morale, and you're out of the game, regardless of how much you're winning.These core mechanics strike a fine balance between accessibility and depth. You won't need to spend half an hour reading all of the opponent's cards, but there's still much more going on in every situation than you'll ever find in something like Hearthstone. There's great variety between the game's seven factions. One has discliplined samurai and patient monks. One has uzi-wielding angels. One has bears. Every card's art is actually a looping animation, and while each faction focuses on a few different mechanics, you can mix up to three factions at a time (foregoing some of the more dedicated members of each group).So yeah, it has a lot going for it, especially for a 'free' game. As for the cash shop...well, the singleplayer campaign gives you starter decks and additional cards for all factions, plus you get a free booster pack every time you gain a level. Points earned can be spent on drafts, which also have pretty great rewards.Eventually, you may want to buy some new packs/decks, and they're all...not terribly priced. They're also not entirely essential, since legendary characters aren't necessarily 'better', they just add more options. All-up, this one is certainly worth a look.			"

It really is the most innovative CCG developed since the genre was first created. The game also has a TON of free content to delve into, hours upon hours of being in CCG heaven without paying a cent. If you know the thrill of cracking open a box of boosters, you won't be disappointed in the way this game sets you up.			"

								I've been playing this game since fairy early in the closed beta, and even then it continued to challenge and entertain as a superb strategy tcg.  A few points (some large, some small) that seperate Infinity Wars from other major TCGs such as Magic and Hearthstone:1) Both players take their turns simultainiously, once both players have locked in their actions for the turn (you cannot see what your opponent decides to do until the turn happens) everything unfolds at the same time, making for fun and balanced (no 1st or 2nd turn advantage to exploit) game pacing.2) The 3 combat zones, and command zone (4 zones total) in which cards can be moved around make for great strategy.  You must utilize the zones to your advantage, as well as bluff and use mind games to keep your opponents on their toes.  Your opponent might be pulling their hair out because of your use in manuevering your troops between the support and attack zones, leaving them unable to be dealt with.  3) All the artwork on the cards is animated!  This might seem like a superficial point, and well it is, but it's something that Magic is unable to do, and Hearthstone only does on their 'golden' cards.  In Infinity Wars all cards have artwork that has some level of animation to it, giving them a little more personality and depth.4) It's still in beta!  There's still so much more in the works that it's amazing.  Even as is the game is a blast to play, yet in the future the game will only bloom and become even more robust and smooth in both gameplay and functionality of the UI.5) It's FREE!  Much like Hearthstone, this game can be played with zero dollars of investment.  Through minimal daily effort it's possible to ammass a collection capable of building a fairly competitive deck, or at least enough points to start doing drafts (Rift Runs) on a regular basis.6) Terror Moose!

								While still being a beta and subjec to change, Infinity Wars offers a very enjoyable and easy to pick up take on the TCG genre. The tutorial features are extensive and extremely helpful, the different card factions make the game great for a variety of different play styles and allows for extensive strategy customization through hybrid deck building. The cards and AI encounters are extremely well balanced which becomes apparent once you understand the key points to the game, which again is a very quick process with the in depth tutorial options. And in my opinion another great selling point is the fact that the matches go fairly quickly and you can get a lot done in a fairly short amount of time. Definitely a game that everyone remotely interested in TCGs should pick up.			"

All of that plus the sci-fi aesthetic of a lot of the cards makes me prefer it greatly to Hearthstone. The one thing I am happy that they use that is similar to Hearthstone is the resources. Each turn your max goes up by one, and there are cards to give you more resources beyond that. I really like the idea of the 4 seperate play zones, one for attacking cards, one for defending cards and the support and command zones.			"

Very juicy cards, with great (and sometimes overpowered) powers, and you can actually buy and build decks with in-game points, despite it's micro-economy!

												Hands down the most innovative and deep strategic card game I have ever played.Commander slots: add consistency and unique aspects to each game. Makes your army feel much more like a planned squad and less like a random sampling of units.Consistent resource progression each turn: No more land draw forfeits. No more annoying to buy multi-land. This games does something reasonable instead and gives you 1 additional resource to spend each turn. Land is now a unique tactical card type.Simultaneous turns and three battlefront zones: now you have to outthink your opponent rather than just counter his cards.In-game marketplace: no more wasted mana/resources if you don’t want to cast any of the cards in your hand. On each turn, in a game, you can spend your resources to play the cards in your hand OR to get various card draw and economic benefits.-There are more well thought out and planned features than I can reasonably list here for the card collector and expert gamer alike, but you should definitely check this game out for yourself. 10/10 "

Some people get mad about overpowered decks but this one person said this ""This game is like chess there are endless ways to win at5 this game.(Not eaxct words)"" and he is right not only there are many ways to win but, there is a whole Q&A staff and Manger who is online 99.9% of the time (NOT KIDDING......) people can come devoted to this game very easliy and i for one is devoted to this game.

												Firstly, I was just amazed by the game. It was a year ago, and after that time... Well, developers took a crap on it and just made it into money making machine. Infinity Wars lost a lot players when this happened, because it was a lot harder to obrtain cards, no new content was added and the game was basically in stagnation. But recently devs has changed, and it was a change for good. With new patch 2.0 ""Reborn"" game is actually in a very good state. Most of annoying bugs was fixed(Yes, there is one with invisible cards on graveyard pile when you try to use any kind of summoning from it, only first in a row is visible), game got a pretty nice graphic change, not of course anything very big, but a lot of nice changes, shop is more viable for players to use, BETTER MATCHMAKING ONLINE which is just great because it was just terrible when old devs were developing Infinity Wars, and few mechanics were changed to give new meta to the ranked matches. Overall, game was good, fell to it knees, then it was picked up by new devs... And changes that they introduced made this game very fun and good again. Just waiting for new card expansions. Yes, 80 hrs(currently on my account when I'm writing this reviev) might be a bit small for a positive but I'm certain I'll spend a lot more of my free time with Infinity Wars.Long story short - Try the game. It's really worth it just to try because it's not a P2W type of F2P. Maybe it will fit you. It might be a really nice game if of course current developers will keep adding new content. Also, you might get a lot of fun and playtime on it. It's really enjoyable when you get to it.			"

Simple yet strategic game, 7.5/10.However, after hours of gameplay, it appears to be quite hard to find a opponent (occationally same opponents), and you can sort of call it a ""pay to win"" game. Don't get me wrong, its is possible to play and win without paying at all, but investing money in this game can potencially gain you a huge adventage. However, its not too hard to get more cards (just not as good), most of the commons and uncommons of the Core 2013 booster pack can be obtained, just by playing through the campaign. And When some achievments (non-steam) is unlocked, players somtimes / often will get a couple of cards (~10). And In game currency can also buy player some cards. For 15 cards packs (which garenteeds 3 uncommon and a rare) cost players around 5250 IP(In-game Points) *NOTE each win gains player around 150 IP, each lost will only award the player for 75 IP (to get a fifteen cards deck requires around 35 wins) or 300 LP (~3 USD). Or players can also start with a ""pre-made"" deck which  defined each factions. (Players are strongly recommended to finish the campaign before purchasing any one of them, due to the fairly high pricing at 12, 950 IP (87 wins) or 750 LP (~4.80 USD). I recommend beginers to spent ~20 USD first and buy ONE deck, and 7 packs  of 15-card booster, that should start player off in the game. (NOTE* please check this site http://infinity-wars.wikia.com/wiki/Infinity_Wars_Wiki  to determine which 15-card booster you are purchasing.) DO NOT buy Core 2013, player will gain most of those cards within campaign. For cards you want, however did not have the luck to fetch them from the booster, no worries, players can go on the Trade Channel (the second option of chat box channels in the lower left conor of the window) and the common language is looking for (LF), want to trade (WTT) [Trade out]. (NOTE* players are required to be at level five or above in order to invite a trade, however, players can message the other trader to invite instead) Good luck for fetching cards! Enjoy the game! If this is helpful please dont forget to rate up this review so others can see it. Thanks you!			"

												It's so close to getting a recommendation, and I actually really like this game but there are just some things that really rub me the wrong way.I've left the game for a few months and came back because I got a promo code. I didn't leave because of any specific problem, I just didn't feel like playing it for a while.So I started a rift run, got super nice cards, lost one match fairly and lost 2 by awful misfortune. Well damn, but that happens. I still love doing rift runs because the game mechanic is just nice.So I use the promo booster, grind some IP and buy the rift deck so I can improve my drafted deck.And not long after, on another rift run, I get 2 luckstomps again. Ugh. Well, I almost never handle RNG gracefully and I once had streak of misfortune in games that if reserved would make me win the lotto jackpot. Twice in a row.I hate luckstomps, and I hate them both ways, whether I lose or win. Especially in a game like IW I prefer a difficult and intricate match that results in a loss than a simple one-sided slaughter that results in a victory for me.There nowadays seem to be more lock-and-key combos of decks where 2 totally valid decks end up with one player suffering a guaranteed loss. I'd wager it's a result of adding more cards, and I'll be honest, I have no idea how to fix it, I won't even try.But wait, this is still not the reason I give this game a thumbs down. While I feel the RNG and luck part is a bit too harsh now in IW I could deal with it, or if I couldn't I would just silently move on.What's bothering me is lacking polish. When I left the game there were the occasional issues with card graphics glitching out (which are still there to some extent) but that's just cosmetic. After I returned there were multiple bugs that affected gameplay.2 notable examples:1. Enemy has a Hell's Gambler and it activates TWICE during the first turn and works twice, which gives a really unfair advantage, the card is only supposed to activate once2. During my second rift run (2 misfortune losses in) I had a REALLY nice game, only a bit luck from my enemy for the first turns but it was a really difficult and fun game and I had a bit more luck later in the game, hell if I would've lost normally it would've been totally fine. But no. I lost to a serious glitch. My enemy plays a nice exile combo and replicates flying dragons like crazy and I struggle to defend. Then I get a Lance of Jinhai and use it on an Evolving Parasite, so it gets reach and can take over the first attacking dragon and defeat the second, after that a morale victory would've been in reach and those were his last 2 dragons as well.Alas upon resolving the turn the game quickly switches my parasite with another character in the assault zone. And no, there was no card in play and no played ability that warranted this switch. And no, I did not place the cards wrong and just thought I did everything right. I have the game on video and rewatched it multiple times, checked every card that was in play. The switch was uncalled for and it killed me, it totally ruined the game. And prematurely ended my rift run.I'm not a sore loser if it comes to fair matches. But I'm a very sore loser if it comes to losing because of glitches. Even more so in a game mode like rift where every loss hurts and every victory counts. And this is not the first game that I kinda love but ultimately dropped ONLY because of lacking polish.It's becoming an awful trend in modern game development. I'm looking at you Tera, with random warp barrier cancelling and atrocious optimization that leads to single digit FPS on high-end systems. I'm also looking at you X Rebirth, with frequent game breaking bugs that even went as far as corrupting saved games permanently.Well X Rebirth is fixed nowadays but I won't forget the pain of having pre-ordered it just to get smacked in the face by a storm of glitches.Really poeple. New cards and expansions are great, but a certain level of polish should come before new content.Fix game breaking bugs before adding new content.I for one will drop this game for a while. I really like it so I might come back some other time and give it another chance, especially when the new campaign is fully implemented because the story has potential. I like the gameplay, the story, the visuals it's just that lacking polish and glitches get the better of me. Again. I'll be sending the video to the devs so they'll be able to take a look.			"

								Just like Pokemon and Yugioh the card game. This one takes it to a whole new level. This card game allows the player to have multiple decks that consist of each faction, except one cannot mix the cards with two different factions in a single deck. The way you get cards is easy and you do not actually have to spend money to retrieve them. Just play the game such as the campaigns for each faction and there is the start of one of your decks. Most of the other card games that were back in the 90's and around 2000 started to rot away slowly. This one seems like it is bringing that good old card game fun back like when pokemon and Yugioh first released. I highly consider anyone to give this card game a try.			"

Posted: June 15, 2014
												I’ve played a couple of digital card games extensively (Shadow Era, Hearthstone) as well as dabbled with a few others (Solforge, PoxNora, Kingdoms CCG).  Out of all of these digital card games, I would say that I have only truly loved Shadow Era’s gameplay mechanics, so when I read about Infinity Wars on Steam, I was hesitant, as history demonstrated that I was inclined to dislike a TCG more often than not. Furthermore, after I downloaded Infinity Wars and jumped into the tutorial, I felt even more hesitant, because I found its simultaneous-turn system and multi-zone battlefield confusing to learn.I cannot stress enough how glad I am to have fumbled through the tutorial and AI campaign missions. As a result, I discovered a true strategic gem – a gem in beta with much more polish than many other digital card games which have been fully released. Sure, Infinity Wars has gorgeous animated cards, a delightful music score, and engrossing atmosphere/lore with 8 distinctly different factions [8, not including the Star Trek factions]. That’s super. But what sells me are the game mechanics. Unlike most other digital card games, the battlefield of Infinity Wars is divided into multiple zones (command zone, support zone, assault zone and defense zone). You can move your characters between most of these zones, and certain destructive spells only work on your opponent’s characters when they are in certain zones at a certain moment in time.  In addition, turns are taken simultaneously, which results in plenty of wicked mind-games going on between you and your opponent in PVP. It sounds a bit complicated, but trust me -- it’s awesome. In other digital card games, I sometimes felt frustrated at not being able to draw a major card in time (major = integral part of my deck strategy), or felt the frustrations of pay2win and lack of balance. Infinity Wars addresses the first concern with the command zone mechanic (3 “commander” characters, or characters which are integral to a deck’s strategy, are available at the start of the game, and you can play them on the actual battlefield or use their abilities as soon as you have the resource [mana] for them). Furthermore, my frustrations of getting a “bad draw” are mostly quelled by the trading post system, in which a player can obtain extra cards, or swap out cards, by paying resources. I don’t feel that Infinity Wars follows a pay2win business model at all – you can actually build a competitive deck fairly quickly. You receive a large selection of cards by completing the academy (training) and campaign missions, and earn cards by playing each day and completing achievements. Very rarely have I seen a card played by an opponent in PVP that screamed “IWIN” (you know what I mean). In other words, I think the game is pretty well-balanced for a beta. There are favorable and not-so-favorable matchups depending on which faction(s) you utilize, of course.I think that strategic-minded gamers will also love deck-building in Infinity Wars, as you can combine cards from different factions to create a truly unique deck that’s perfectly suited to one’s individual play-style. Furthermore, I love that there are many different ways to win, aside from the standard “destroy the opponent’s base”. Certain factions lean towards playing a certain way to win, and mixing complementary cards belonging to different factions in order to reach such a win condition is incredibly fun. As soon as I discovered there was a super-defensive faction that was based on Ancient Chinese lore and obtaining board-control in long, drawn-out games, I was like, “OH HELL YES, THEY TOTALLY MADE THAT FACTION WITH MY INTERESTS AND PLAYSTYLE IN MIND!” (I’m referring to Descendants of the Dragons). I splashed my Descendants deck with some complementary healing and buff cards from a different faction (Warpath), and soon enough, rainbows were shooting out of my nostrils (that’s a good thing). I do want to make a comparison to another digital card game before I conclude. However, I don't want to ramble about Hearthstone too much.  I want this review to mostly focus on the intrinsic qualities of Infinity Wars, but I have to stress how multi-dimensional and in-depth Infinity Wars is compared to Hearthstone. The complex bluffing games essential to Infinity Wars, multi-zone battlefields, as well as the creative freedom of its deck-building system, just makes Hearthstone seem so one-dimensional in comparison. In other words, Infinity Wars truly feels like a battlefield, with 3 commanders accessible from the get-go which complement one’s unique play-style and desired win condition. As long as it is financially feasible, I hope that Lightmare, the developers of Infinity Wars, will continue to develop their game with the more ""strategically-minded"" niche gamer in mind, as opposed to making “catering for the casual masses” their number one priority. Of course, Infinity Wars has its flaws. I encounter numerous display bugs each day, and I think the user interface needs much refinement (why can’t I sort my cards so I can easily differentiate between my soul-bound and tradable cards?). That said, I strongly feel as though Lightmare are on the right track. From what I’ve seen, they’re a cool company that truly listens to community feedback (you’ll see them actively participating in discussions with the community, even outside of the official forums and Steam). If this gigantic rant makes one reader (who is interested in strategy and/or digital card games) think ""Hey, Infinity Wars appears rather complicated at first, but I would like to approach it with an open-mind and check out the game mechanics!"" -- I would be very happy.

								I have been a player of card games for more than half of my life. The best thing about Infinity Wars that truly separates it from its DTCG peers is the Simultaneous Turns mechanic. You need to play the game yourself to experience the magnificence of it as I don't want to spoil it for you by describing it (the name of the mechanic is a big hint in itself), but if you like TCGs in general, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to miss out on Infinity Wars, and that's the greatest compliment I can give this game!

												After wasting crap load of time and money on MTG, I decided to return to TCG once Digital TCG started rising again (i.e. Hearthstone).  Hearthstone didn't do it for me because it was one of the most casual♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever tried in my life.  So I looked for a better alternative.  Then I found Infinity Wars.  I'll cover IW in two main aspects: F2P and Gameplay/Strategy potentials.Is it F2P?I think the game is pretty fair.  Firstly, yes you can actually TRADE cards in this game.  You can buy Lightmare Points to buy booster packs but you can also earn IW Points to buy booster packs.  You earn IW points from playing games online, including private games with your friends.  How many games does it take to buy a booster pack?  I think it is around 30-40 games (Just a rough estimate, haven't done the math myself), assuming 50% win rate.  But there's more.When you start the game, you will have to play some campaigns.  They will teach you about each factions and you will earn starter deck of each faction when you complete first 3 or 4 missions of each factions.  Also, any games you play, you get experience points for your account and you will get a free booster pack every time you level up.  Every level requires more experience than the last but in the beginning you will level up often and you will be showered with booster packs.  But there's more.There is a thing called daily rewards and weekly quests.  Every week, you will be given 3 quests.  It can be just gaining certain amount of experience or playing some amount of PvP.  You get one random card for each quest you complete.  You will get 1 random card for logging in daily and you will get another random card for playing 3 PvP games.  So assuming you are diligent, you get 2 cards per day, another 2*7+3 = 17 cards per week.  And these are truly RANDOM cards.  I've gotten couple of legendaries just from logging in every day.   It's pretty rare but it's really nice when you get them.I also need to note that free cards you get from daily, weekly or levels are SOULBOUND, meaning you can't trade them.  Only the cards you get with Lightmare or IW points are tradeable.  I think it's fair considering how many cards they pump into you and you don't want to screw the trade economy.So in summary,1. 2 cards every day (untradeable)2. 3 cards every week (untradeable)3. 1 booster pack (15 cards) every level (untradeable)4. In-game points you earn to buy booster packs (tradeable)Gameplay/StrategyIW is definitely unique.  I'll cover them in sections.  1. Simultaneous turnsMost card games are turn-based but this game has SIMULTANEOUS turns, meaning you and your opponent plan at the same time and things happen all at once.  This means you have to plan according and predict your opponent's moves instead of waiting for them to make a move and react.  If you played MTG, then you know about saving that kill spell in case your opponent buffs a creature into a raging hulk or saving that counter-spell in case he casts some devastating spell.  Not in this game.  You have to predict them coming.  On the other way around, you can dodge certain spells by moving your characters in and out of the battlefield.  This adds an element of mind-game.  Instead of casting spells and hope that your opponent doesn't have an answer for it, you can move around it, dodging, baiting and calling shots.  It really depends on the deck but some games can be very intense.  You don't just play your strategy and hope your opponent doesn't have an answer to it.  If you know they could potentially counter you, you can find a way around by baiting.  This is only possible in Digital TCG so it's taking full advantage of the digitalized TCG!  This fact alone is worth checking this game out.2. Deck buildingAlright, magic has 5 colored factions but IW has 8?  (There's 2 more factions for Star Trek series but I won't cover that here)  And you can only have up to 3 factions for each deck?  What's up with that?  Well, IW is different in a sense that your deck will be based on 3 cards and they are called Commanders.  Every deck has 3 commanders and their faction alliance determines how you build the deck and each faction has their unique strategy and combining them.  You can build a pure faction deck and play to its fullest strength or you can make a deck of hybrid factions, playing with jack-of-all-trade playstyle.  You aren't just limited to 3 factions because there is a card that allows you to play any factions.  ANY character card can be a commander.  The 3 commanders are placed in the commander zone at every game and you can play them whenever you want, provided that you have enough resources.  Most of the time, you can play the character's ability from the commander zone so you can even build a deck around that entire aspect.If you played MTG, you know well about resource management.  In IW, you gain 1 resource every turn so you rarely have to worry about being mana-screwed.  The commanders are like lands in a sense that they determine the color of your deck.  There are characters and spells to boost your resource to get ahead early so there are some resource management in the game.  Your deck should be consistent with your intended gameplay every time since you won't get mana-skrewed very well, provided that you balanced the resource curve.  Consistency is the key because I really hated getting mana screwed in MTG.  Honestly I think that is one of the major design flaws of MTG.  MTG is more flexible with deck building in a sense that you can have any color and any cards in your deck provided that you have the lands to support it.  But ultimately you have to buy those 20 dollar rare lands to even make your dreams possible.  I miss the potentials in MTG but not that much.  Coming from MTG which has beautifully balanced 5 color scheme (each color allies with 2 while opposing one), I felt kinda iffy about the whole factions thing, especially since the devs seem to intend to add or subtract them in the future (super not sure about this but there were 7 factions in the beginning but now there's 8. 10 if you include the non-canon ones) but I learned to love the lore and each faction is quite fun to try.In summary:1. Simulatneous turns for mind-games2. Commanders and 8 unique factions for intersting deck building strategies3. Basic resource management so you won't get mana screwed most of the time			"

												This game is actually quite a treat. I personally love TCG and when Hearthstone came out, I was excited. I immediately picked it up, and put money on it. Not even into my first 24 hours of playing, I got bored. It lacked true depth. Infinity Wars is different, and expanding. The different styles is really what takes me. Do you pull a deffensive stance and let the moral of your opponents fall? Do you summon hordes of troops, rally, and charge into battle? Do you, summon your opponents graveyard and destroy them?All I can say is, it's free, it's expansive, and it's fun. The game has been out for a bit, but litterally just hit Steam. Give it a chance.8/10			"

												One of the best strategy games I've ever played. This TCG (Trading Card Game) has 7 different factions + 2 other factions made just for fun to play with (not usable in ranking). All cards are animated, and some animations are simply gorgeus...The battle field is also animated. Daily log-in reward + daily 3games played reward (no need to win to get them) of 1 card of any card, or if you are lucky you'l get a mini-set of multiple cards.Very easy to learn. In-game economy it's just stable and the cards I find them with a very fair price (pleaze don't try to destroy it by you're egoism, remember that if the prices go up, it goes up for you also, keep it that way) like 1 rare card for 1 rare card.Lots of riendly people also, including myself :D.Just a good game that deserves at least a single try, if not more tryes.

								I. Am. Hooked.Yes, it's neat that the cards are animated I guess, but not a big deal. The mechanics of the game, however, are a big deal; and are an incredibly unique take on TCG. (Yes, TCG - you can trade!)The biggest things that caught my eye:'Command cards' - three unit cards that you pre-select when making the deck that start off in the corner, revealed. You can tailor specific opening strategies around this, and there are tons of possibilities here. And you don't get screwed over by bad draws, because they're always there at the start.'Trade post' - Speaking of bad draws, the 'trade post' function not only allows you the usual 'mulligan' at the start of the game, but also gives you the ability to spend otherwise unused resources on drawing new cards or even swapping out cards you don't need to draw new cards (for less resources). This is an AWESOME mechanic for bypassing those games where you're basically twiddling your thumbs as you draw useless land cards in magic.It's actually F2P. You get a lot of usable cards from playing through the campaign, and you accrue a decent amount of generic in-game currency to purchase booster/blister packs easily. After a single day of playing I was able to afford a couple of blister packs and I was quite happy with that. One could probably afford a booster pack maybe once a week? Depends on how much you play of course.You can trade. (Well, aside from the starter cards you unlock in campaign mode at least.) I had given up hope that a card game would EVER let you trade, after all the CCGs I've played.There's much more I'm forgetting, and there wouldn't be enough space anyway.TL;DR: It's free, it's actually got a good F2P model from what I can tell, and it's worth your time. Get it.			"

												""Freemium"" comes to computer...  After 9 hrs of play I give up.  What a waste of my life.  Single player was awesome for the first few hours in the beginning, and I reached lvl 7; awesome!  Got some cool cards and some fake money (IP).  That's when the fun ended.  Since I was done with the single player portion of the game (very limited) I thought I'd try my hand at a ""rift run.""  You pay your hard earned fake money (damn near all of it for one shot when you're done with the single player portion) and play against other players in a mode where you're given 4 card choices at a time and have to pick one each time to create a 43 card deck.  Cool (or so I thought) there's a chance to win the deck and some other cards!  I got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me in five games, three losses, two draws, and all of my funny money was gone!  The other awesome part is that if you want to ""buy"" card packs, you have to actually buy them, with real money.  What a♥♥♥♥♥♥game.  Don't waste your time.			"

												First impression of beta; This TCG is made of some serious f**king win.   1. Unique and robust combat system combined with a very fluid interface.   The cards are beautifully animated when you inspect them and it is greatly appreciated. 2. Solid sound effects for a DTCG, which is sadly rare. It could be better and I'm sure it will, these devs look like they pump out a lot of content and patches.3.Techo-fantasy setting.. It's cyber-punk on crack; Robots, demon-infused robots, robot's molesting demons, undead trying to eat the humans who are watching demons getting molested ... it's all here and its fresh and interesting genre for TCGs that is highly reminiscent of Warhammer 40K (which is definitely not a downside) 4. ANDROID SUPPORT. And iOS if you fancy burning money I guess.  But the options are all there and this is a huge drawcard.  I know a lot of people like myself prefer to play on tablets or phone, or at least have the option to. 5. It's F2P so f**king download and try it already, you won't regret it.			"

Early Access Review
								So I've spent some time with Infinity Wars and I'd like to give some initial impressions of the game.  First off let me tell you this game is deeep.  It's so deep that after eight hours of play my head is still swimming in all the tricks and strategy of the game and I'm fairly sure I still don't understand all of it and I know for certain that in multiplayer there's sharks down there that do.  If you want a challenging card game with loads of strategic possibilities this is the game you've been looking for.With all that depth comes a fairly steep learning curve that's thankfully helped along by some training missions.  The training missions are pre-established, stacked deck games that will teach you the basics of the game.  I found the training missions to be very helpful in understanding the game play although at the same time somewhat frustrating as the computer metagames things that, in my opinion, no real player could anticipate.  In some instances of the training mission the computer downright cheats to teach you your lesson, doing things that are absolutely outside the rules.  In the final ""test"" of the training mission the computer starts up with cards that could never be on the field of play until many turns into the game in a real game.  It's frustration to the max as it's nearly impossible to defeat the last test without playing some of the real game to get more and better cards to build a better deck.  It nearly made me rage quit the game forever.Other forms of solo play are a campaign mission for all the games factions, which will keep you playing in solo for a while, and several bots to challenge.  Then of course there's the PvP play where you go head to head against another real player.  Personally I have not yet done PvP and I'm fairly sure there are some other game modes in there that I haven't seen yet.So what is the actual game play like??  Well if you can imagine, it's as though Magic the Gathering, Yugiou, and Texas Hold 'em got together in a funky three way and had a child.  There's the normal getting packs of random cards to collect with which you build a custom deck of your own with. Creature summoning, fighting it out with creature health and life scores, keep your own heath up, and summon spells and enchantments.  Fairly standard concepts if you've ever played other card games.The first unique thing about this game though is that turns are taken simultaneously.  That's right, while your planning out what you’re going to do next so is your opponent.  Once you both hit ""end turn"" what you both did happens in a particular order.  This allows for some interesting game play and a bit of bluffing from time to time.  You'll find yourself trying to second guess and plan ahead for what your opponent ""might"" do.  This plays on the way there are 3 zones for your summoned creatures to be in, support, attack, and defense and that some cards target one of those areas specifically.  If there's a creature in the zone you targeted during your turn your good to go, but if your opponent has moved that creature to another zone your spell card basically fizzles.  The other interesting thing about this game is the morale bar.  The morale bar starts at 100 points, same as your player health.  Each time one of your creatures dies you lose a set amount of morale based on what that particular creature's morale loss is.  And then there are cards which will boost or reduce yours or your opponent’s morale.  Should your morale reach zero you will also lose the game.  It's sort of like having a second health bar that gets reduced by other means and gives more depth to how you set up your deck and how you go about winning the game. It all makes for some interesting and different game play than any other card game you'll find.  The next question; is this a pay to win game?  So far as I've seen at the moment I'd say no.  Yes there are random packs and decks you can buy with either real money, or credits you earn while you play the game.  If you choose to keep it free it will take you longer to get a larger selection of cards from which to build your deck from and thereby your deck may initially be weaker than say someone who'd played the same amount of time yet spent real money on cards....  But keep in mind that even in a real world card game like Magic the Gathering or Yugiou I could go down to my local game store and plop down tons of money to buy boxes of cards right now, or buy more slowly as I have the extra money.  In that respect it's not much different than real life.  Also remember that these packs are random, so even if I gain them though play credits there's always the possibility that I may pull out better cards, or cards that are more important to me, over time than a person who plopped down a ton of real money to buy them.  Finally there's also a lot of player skill to factor in.  Even if you have an incredible selection of awesome cards there's the question of can recognize and build a viable deck with them and even if you can do that can you use that deck to win?  I've seen many a player in real world card games that had a great deck, but they had no clue how to use it properly.So at the end of the day is this game good??  I'd say yes, it's a lot of fun and something I intend to continue playing.  Is it better than say, Hearthstone, the other popular online card game right now??  I would say that the answer to that depends on what you want in a card game.  Comparing the two is a bit like comparing checkers to chess.  Hearthstone is also a great game, but is much more simplistic and straightforward.  If you want an easy to understand, high speed card game go with Hearthstone.  If you want a deeper, more challenging game go with Infinity Wars.  Personally I think I enjoy the depth of Infinity Wars more.			"

												Flawed GreatnessPlay this game! It´s free and it´s worth a try. However the lack of missing features that i´d consider the basics make me not recommend it in the curent stage.So why do i still suggest that you play this game?Simple enough: The gameplay. It´s a unique card game mechanic that survives without resource problems, RNG or disadvantages for either the first or the second player.These three fact alone make it stand out already. Players play at the same time so there is no unbalancing in the order that most TCGs and CCGs face, resources accumulate automatically which gets rid of some really depressing games (this feature is luckily becoming the new standart in this genre) and other than the RNG factor that comes with the genre, there are no cards that vary in their effectiveness.There are a ton of different classes which all feel extremely unique unlike anything i´ve seen so far in card games. But as i said, the best thing about this game are the mechanics. 3 different zones give a ton of strategy and there are more win conditions than just beating your opponent down.If i could end this review here, Infinity Wars would easily be my favourite digital card game.But sadly i can´t. Because despite of making everything important right, it fails at some basic things that if you take them for granted, which i most certainly do, will push you away.Keep in mind that this is still in early access and that the following things only apply to the state of the game that i played.First off, there is nearly no solo play. The campain is fun but over really quickly which means that if you want to play against the AI, you´re stuck playing against the same decks over and over. They keep playing the same cards and after a few rounds you just lose interest in playing against the same things again. The worst thing is, that they don´t even cover all races in the game.Secondly: There are races that are unexcessable without real money. Want to play the dead with their ever growing zombies? Well you can only get those via the premade decks which in return you can only get with real money. This can be extremely frustrating if it happens to a free user and will immediatly make him stop playing the game.There´s also a lack of polish. Sure you can´t expect that from a non major developer but if opening a pack takes 3 years and with all the animations that just look super crappy, the game gets a kind of cheesy feel to it.There are a lot of other little things i didn´t like, like battlegrounds that make annoying sounds when you hit the end turn button or the fiddling to select / get to the card you want to look at.After all i can only say again: you should give this game a try. If you can overlook the negative sites you will find a rich experience that will satisfy all desires you could have in a card game.Sadly i couldn´t...			"

												Great game but so much salt with the vets the devs seem like they have abandined it and when they d make cards they are all most always game breaking also it feels like they have made as many bugs as they removed. With the new set coming out and how the CM seems to have gona completly MIA I feel the need to point out some more positive traits the game has.When you are losing in ranked you have about a 20% chance of a endless turn bug happening sparing you the loses The CM has goten rid of most the mean nasty vets making the game alot nicer for new players as they have more comparitvly competive dcks.It has Bi weekly weekly post so you know whats going on every other week.Over all still a train wreck.

								I've played MtG, pokemon, and DBZ card games among some others I have foggier memory of. I've tried as number of card games on the computer. I really wanted to like hearthstone but hated it. Infinity Wars hits the nail on the head for me. It really brings back every feel I used to feel for Magic the Gathering, without being a copy.  The animated cards really seal the deal for me. Every card features beautiful art work that I actually admire, much like alot of the art in MtG. The planned multiplayer modes for the future like multi headed giant and just pure free for all also have me extremely excited as my most beloved memories involved those games. I mostly play free to play, and while this game can be happily enjoyed not spending a dime, I feel no remorse loosening my scrooge like hold on my wallet and shelling our for a few packs of preorders whenever a new set comes out.

												Typical f2p trading card game.  Casual players get destroyed by people who play it 18 hours a day or buy card packs.  You can play against AI to build up your deck, but the card selection from rewards isnt all that good.  If you wanna buy some decks or play it 24/7 to build up decks, then go for it.  If your'e a casual player, dont waste your time.			"

												Its a really good game with decent graphics and a well thought thought storyline. Has really good ideas but....match making is dumb, i just started the game and had to fight an END GAME player who had all the OP cards etc. I also see this problem in other reviews, Furthermore some of the campaigns on the first stage its basically impossible. You would think u can out smart the ai bot (like the game tells u to do) but u cant, since their cards are much stronger than yours. If u want a better version that this, go to blizzard with Hearthstone.			"

								I'm really liking Infinity Wars.  Normally, I would avoid games that have aspects of 'drain-your-wallet-to-get-the-cool-stuff' but I'm happy to report that after only 5 hours of playing, I have a few epic cards, and I'm really enjoying myself. Gameplay, for the veteran MTG player, will feel very familar.  I like the layout, which is animated all pretty-like.  The cards themselves have great artwork, and it's not that hard at all to get a hang of the rules.  There's a few glitches or maybe issues that I'm not quite understanding -- when I play a location, the playfield seems to change to .. just a field.  The fortress disappears, etc.  Maybe that's cause I'm playing a nature/green/whatever factioned card?  Anyway .. Deck construction is cool, but the instructional video shows a completely different layout (a more useful one) than what I got.  It's a bit of a pain to have to scroll through cards instead of being able to sort them by cost, abilities, faction, etc.  I'll have to look more into that, I'm probably just missing something.Overall gameplay is quick and fun.  The AI for the campaigns is challenging, but I'm really looking forward to some PvP duels. Highly recommend this free game. "

								-Magic and other TCG player of 15+ Years- I've played just about every major TCG to come along since magic and even though I quit magic years ago nothing has quite been able to scratch that deep stratedgy itch. If you are tired of the liniear games and crave a little more stratedgy with the same kind of learnign curve you would expect from magic than I would say this may just be your game. Remember it is still in beta but has a lot of potential. For a free to play game it's possible to get everything you want for free via trading and points you earn through battling in game. Is it the fastest way? Not by a long shot but they need to make money so stop complaining. It should still work but use code: 2145F while signing up for a few free cards. Note: You can also play against the AI in a long campaign. For those of you who like warm ups.			"

												I've played many TCG games, ranging from Magic the Gathering, to Yu-Gi-Oh, to Hearthstone and so forth. In my honest opinion, Infinity Wars is pretty unique considering how hard it is to make a TCG game that seems fun and not as dull or repetitive as other games.INNOVATIONS: Simultaneous turns                         Unique effects that range from invincibility to ground units, to attacking if destroyed another character, etc.                         Unique character abilities that range from a LARGE variety of things                         A 4 Zone field which are Attack, Defense, Support and Command.                         ALL cards are animated                         Artifacts and Locations that allow a deck built around them                         9 different factions, and more added as time goes on                         The command section which allows expensive cards abilities to be used without putting them on the fieldAs you may see, it doesn't seem much. That's because it's too hard to write down without boring you with an extremely long list of excessive text which you or may not even read. But moving on, what you're actually looking forPROS:A very good Free To Play model and is by no means a Pay to Win game         An infinite number of builds can be created due to the large variety of cards         A well balanced game compared to other TCG for not letting different factions have too much power over the other         This is not a brain dead game. An example of one would be, but not limited to Rush Down Hunter from Hearthstone         The staff is actually very responsive to the community and constantly listens to any suggestionsCONS:The layout of the game may confuse new players          The game looks pretty complex to new players          Hard to start getting into without playing at least 1 complete story line for Campaign for cards          Bots are in this game (the bad ones that exploits game mechanics), but the admins will be removing them          Have to wait 6 minutes for a person AFK in a game before kicking them and giving you a win          Have to wait 3 minutes if a person DCs before able to claim a winCONCLUSION: Overall, I would say this is a well made TCG which gives a more military like spin to TCG as well as giving off a strategic mindset with all the new abilities, artifacts, locations, and effects, the only problems would be new players trying to get in to the game, and the AFK/DC system. The rest of the problems were made by part of the community that create bots to exploit the game to get rare cards. "

												This is a digital TCG, trading card game.  It has an in game item store but it seems you can play to earn all that you could buy, no buying wins in this game! The game mechanics are sound and the play speed is as fast as you want it to go.  I really enjoy this game due to the animation, the AI is good, you can unlock a ton of content in a few short hours, deck building is smooth and effortless, and the campaigns are very well put together.  The game has PVP, campaign, and practicing against AI.  I highly recommend this game as it was FREE.  9.5/10 fun factor and great replayablity.  Graphics and sound both get 7.5/10.A+ game!			"

												Being a general fan of TCGs, I've played quite a few of them. Currently, I don't think there's a better TCG on the market than Infinity Wars. I'll just make a few comparisons with the ones I've been playing in the last few months.Hearthstone is a finely polished TCG and as far as graphics goes, it's my top TCG. However, you have a fairly limited amount of cards and getting new ones is a chore. I can't honestly say it's pay-to-win, but it definitely pushes you into buying stuff because of the slow pace with which you get new cards. A real campaign does not exist, but you can buy a couple of missions for a steep price and finish it in a day (if you're slow). What pushed me over the edge and away from this game was the lack of rewards - when I beat challenges on nightmare difficulty and was simply returned to the main menu. It was at that moment that I said ""awwwww, forget it"".Hex is advertised as a revolutionary take on the TCG genre and it promises a lot. Promises is the key word here since there is almost no PvE content. Also, Hex still feels like just another MTG clone but with a god complex. In time, it might show itself as THE TCG game, but gamers (and everyone else, for that matter) don't particularly like waiting long for promises to come true.Finally, we come to Infinity Wars and to the reasons why I consider it the best TCG currently on the market. Let's do this one with pros, cons and neutrals.PROS+ playing board elements differ from the standard MTG&clones layout+ simultaneous turns make it less likely for you to wait for a slow opponent+ every card is animated+ a lot of achievements+ cards, of course. You get cards for logging in, playing 3 games in a day, finishing campaign missions, winning PvP matches, levelling up and god knows what else. The least I got was 2 cards a day. DId I mention that you get a whole deck of cards (40) for finishing the first 5 missions of a campaign?+ every non-cosmetic item (and some cosmetic ones as well) can be bought with the currency you earn from playing games+ you have additional options to utilize if you don't want to spend your energy on cards (shuffle and draw a card, draw a card, increase max resources)+ PvP mode where decks are combined does a good job of eliminating P2WCONS- automatic zooming when you click on a card- not being able to zoom in on a card when making a deck- if you or the enemy have a lot of creatures in a single zone it's almost impossible to target the creature you want to target- you have to visit the forums to learn enough info to make a valid deck (e.g. I overlooked card purity and every deck I made was illegal before I read the rules)NEUTRALS- card art (some are good, some would look better static)- a lot of factions- no cards have their own voiceAll in all, it's the one TCG that gives me a sense of accomplishment every time I play it (and even on a bad day). Except for some things that were overlooked (like the lack of zoom in your card library), it's everything I've wanted from a TCG. Plus, it's free.GENERAL SCORE 9,0/10.0			"

												Although I'm recommending this game, it's not without reserve.I think it's a great take on the video game TCG genre. The battlefield concept is interesting and adds a lot of depth to the strategy and tactics of these games.But I feel like the game doesn't give you enough alternatives to earn in-game cash to buy cards. I'm also not happy with the game's matching ability. As a starting player without even a PVP badge on my first PVP games, it kept matching me with someone that had gold badges on everything and kicked my butt thoroughly every single game. After my third match in a row with this guy I gave up playing for a while, and soured my first experience with PVP in the game.Secondly, even though I've completed all the available single-player content, i don't feel like I have enough cards to field a viable deck in PVP unless I'm in pauper mode. So if you don't mind playing in pauper mode (and can find opponents in this mode), or if you want to spend the cash on one of the pre-made decks, you may be frustrated during your initial play against real players with full decks.

								I've played MtG, pokemon, and DBZ card games among some others I have foggier memory of. I've tried as number of card games on the computer. I really wanted to like hearthstone but hated it. Infinity Wars hits the nail on the head for me. It really brings back every feel I used to feel for Magic the Gathering, without being a copy.  The animated cards really seal the deal for me. Every card features beautiful art work that I actually admire, much like alot of the art in MtG. The planned multiplayer modes for the future like multi headed giant and just pure free for all also have me extremely excited as my most beloved memories involved those games. I mostly play free to play, and while this game can be happily enjoyed not spending a dime, I feel no remorse loosening my scrooge like hold on my wallet and shelling our for a few packs of preorders whenever a new set comes out.

												What if I told you there was a game that was a animated cardgame with MTG and hearthstone like gameplay? Well, this is it. Infinity Wars is definitely for those who want to play single player or compeditive multiplayer against others.  With plenty different races and linear story missions similar to the MTG game you'll find as much replayability as a card game has. But it's uniques way of attacking/blocking sets it's self appart from other cardgames like MTG. By yourself against CPU's or against friends you can spend time having an awesome adventure!Pros:  Decient SinglePlayer Experience  Free Drafting  FREE!!  Nice looking card art and every card is animated which looks pretty cool!

												I play a lot of CCG's in rl i used to play magic, spellfire, UFS(scout), world of warcraft, L5r, and many online electronic ccg's. I can say for sure infinity wars brings something unique to the table not knowing for either side who will be attacking or defending untill after you've made your moves and plays ads an incredible strategic depth to it. abilities more or less not resolving on an ""instant chain"" really i think leads to a more healthy game environment(like l5r) than the judge heavy play of magic or similar games. i will say that the strategies that are truly viable in each symbol of infinity wars are unfortunately fairly limited for now .... but it really hasnt had that many booster sets yet give it time and i think each set will add new victory conditions and play styles. As to the free to play  / pay to win. I can firmly say as a free player i have never felt like i couldnt compete even right after i finished the tutorial for all factions you get a lot of cards to work with and it doesnt take long to build at least 1 competitive deck, I like where they are going with thier model you can get more cards faster for money, you can but aestetic upgrades for money, they could probably use some in game currency booster options for real money. but on the whole you can indeed play this game 100% for free and have just as much chance to get rares and build a great deck you just wont get packs as fast as someone dropping real coin on it.  The aestetic upgrades are things like backgrounds for your decks while you play, and deck backings. i could maybe see them marketing custom special animations or special animated art for the cards as well ... almost like a ""skin"" if you will.Lastly deck building is honestly a pleasure as you pick your commanders it automatically filters the cards out to match the ""purity"" of your deck so you dont have to sift through a mountain of cards and/or accidentily put an illegal card in it. theres a format checker so you can check to see if your deck is legal in a given format. as well as a built in cost breakdown for your deck so you can watch your curve, a abilities/creatures/artifacts/locations split that not only tells you how many of each you have in deck but splits them up in the deck building screen so if you need to make an alteration things are fast and easy to find.Theres all my pros now to the cons.the game is young ... you will run across some things that young ccg's have such as cards that dont work 100% as printed(sleeper hakeem) and cards that are too strong in given meta like the location for dod that cant be targetted and wins them the game in short order, there are precious few cards to counter it since its a location that cant be targetted so its ""too dependable"" a strategy there is not a full meta yet so combo decks tend to be king especially if they revolve around non creatures to win.  there is definitely rush mechanics(combo) with flame dawn, but control isnt quite there yet as a meta strategy and is almost exclusive to the dod for viability. reanimator works, but the games real problem is that aggro doesn't work, the threat that one could play an aggro deck keeps the more rediculious combo decks out of cycle in most ccg's, sure killing things on the board works but ONLY in the context of going for a quick combo damage victory and scrapping the few early cards in your way(verore/flamedawn). aggro can't target enough things by default to be a viable deck strategy theres no ""combobreaker"" style play yet that works in competitive, its just too hard to get to support row and command center and in the exiles case your hand. They also have situations where most of the colors dont specifically play well with others and 1 or 2 play really well. beasts only really target friendly""beast"" cards, but the robot faction seems to be able to pump anything under the sun, verore and exiles seem the same way it seems silly why anyone would choose the second in either pairing over the other because they then have to bridge the hurdle of ..... ""my cards dont help each other in 99% of cases how do i make this a cohesive deck strategy"" while the first pair are so cohesive with anything they could just throw about anything in there on sybol or in neutral symbol and make it work somehow. I wish they would hire me as a card / rules designer i think i could do a lot for them mechanically.all things summed i would give it a 8/10 very stable game if you're tired of how rediculious the rules are in magic and you dont like stack based games prefer a more strategic feel like l5r as opposed to a solotaire combo vs possible combobreaker style of play like magic. you will like this game. if what you want is to spam 10 cards in a row that your opponent can't do anything about because he didn't specifically sidedeck against you and then proclaim you win. this is probably not the game for you.

												It's great enhancement of the MTG for computers. No crazy land/color management, no regen at end of turn - gameplay changes significantly because of this. Perhaps simpler for someone not accustomed to MTG. Mana system in IW is the same as in relatively old by modern standards game called Etherlords.Overall, I am not very impressed with the art on cards, even if it's partially animated. The gameplay, on the other hand, is pleasurable.Stopped playing because I don't want it to become my daily habit. But it's really nice TCG game, very interesting. I recommend it.			"

												This game makes me so conflicted. It is easily the best TCG in active play. Unfortunately it crashes pretty much without fail every 25 minutes or so. I thought it going to its full release update would help. It did not.Dont get me wrong. I love it; totally fun and easy to learn. But this crashing business is driving me insane. Just let me play the damn game!EDIT: It's been two years, they totally fixed the crashing stuff basically immediately after I made the original review as I recall and even more than two years later, its still the best card game out there bar none. If you actually enjoy card games the only person missing out if you don't play it is you. I hope to all the eldritch beings this game doesn't go under, because NO ONE i've seen is doing even REMOTELY close to as good as infinity wars is in the trading card game industry in terms of gameplay, card balance, and overall fun factor. Hearthstone is akin to smashing your testes with a ball-peen hammer, and infinity wars is like a nice glass of your preferred alcohol by comparison. MTG doesn't come remotely close to being as competetively fair. And so far this is the only card game that isn't threatening to strangle me to death for not PAYING for cards. And this makes the whole post sound kind of elitist but seriously, I've played every card game under the sun, and no one does it like lightmare does for infinity wars. The game is well supported, the art is on par with MTGs cards, cept these are animated. The only real complaint I have with the game anymore is that I don't have enough friends who are intelligent enough to grasp the concept of the gameplay to be able to play with me regularly because the game is very... thourough. There are many aspects to gameplay and will basically require you to be a card game veteran or you will be getting decimated all the time because your ability to customize your deck and strategy is basically not limited by the cards considering how many of them there are. So if you are struggling to find brain cells to rub together and you just put whatever you feel looks cool in your deck you wont have a leg to stand on. Which you could argue is a learning point for real deckbuilding but... Theres a difference between knowing how to play, and knowing how to win, and some people aren't very good at the latter.			"

Well don't play this game because it's not for casuals... :D!It requires a lot of bluffing and high level of skill in ranked play and also because the game became popularrecently building your own deck is the choice... you ask why not to just copy someone others?The answer is: The game is new and people still haven't developed top 10 deck or something and the game has a lot  to offer about deck building opportunities!And one more thing is tremendously fun to play this game with friends because you talk with them and play at the same timeand start bluffing a lot more and have hilarious moments!Definitely recommend this game to anyone with strategical thinking and having skill with card games!I rate it 9.5/10 which is pretty high because the only other card game i rate more than this is Yu - Gi - Oh which is 10/10!

												All of the mechanics in Infinity Wars combined create a very unique game in the landscape of TCGs, while keeping it familiar enough for any veteran or casual of such games to jump right in (after a quick tutorial to help settle in).I would say try it out you may fall in love with it.

												A pleasant surprise, I went in a skeptic and came out a fan. This is a solid digital card game and I feel it is much better than Hearthstone. The card art is good and the card animation makes it even better. Getting cards for free is even easier than Hearthstone. The game is fairly deep and has a good amount of depth to it. It's not MTG deep, but it's enough to keep hardcore TCG players interested.I reccomend trying this out, it might be the best digital card game on the market.			"

								I have played a lot of TCGs in my life but Infinity Wars has proven itself to be among the best. I was surprised because I've played dozens of browser and computer-based card games before and most of them are terribly similar. Infinity wars has not only developed a strong set of mechanics, but the animated art of their cards makes the game a pleasure to look at as well as play. Even if you're hesitant or have other TCGs you really love, I would reccommend giving Infity Wars atleast a try.			"

								I have played a lot of tcg's, which also includes dTCG's. But i never found a game close to the complexity of Infinity wars. The sheer satisfaction you obtain when you predict what your opponent is going to do and play around it and get to see it go off is priceless. Different modes such as drafting, merged decks ( completely kills off the ""oh, you have better cards, obviously iam going to lose"" scenarios), pauper and such which also includes  a  really good campaign and daily quests for free quality cards( Legendary cards for free, anyone?) makes it a top notch F2P dTCG game out there.Overall, game has a beautiful style (The cards look gorgeous and are well animated), complex and intresting mechanics and good f2p model. Recommended for every TCG wannabe out there.			"

								Solid card game with a lot of variance to create unique decks.  Of course like any card game some cards are much better than others, but devs look to be active in keeping the game as balanced as it can be.  Able to earn a decent amount of cards if played regularly and have bought card packs from the 1st expansion and was able to build a fairly solid deck.  The biggest fault in the game is not auction/trading house, but just a trading channel.  This to me is the biggest reason I would rate this about a 6.5/10.  If they are able to add a solid auction/trading house would not hesitate to give it a 9/10.  There is a bit of a pay to win, but enough solo that seems to be expanding so you can still get to a solid level to compete against others, just a tad bit slower.  Have played a few card games and this one seems the most balanced so far I have played.Invite Code 1269F and feel free to add me ingame.			"

Why on Earth isn't this game already in your Library?  It's free to play, the patch as of March 12, 2014 makes obtaining a solid card collection VERY easy, the campaign and quest objectives are continuously challenging when you just want to test your deck, and it is so easy to find yourself glued to your mouse on your fifth draft wondering when the addiction started.Praise aside, this game is still in beta.  There happens to be plenty of transparency regarding what is currently not working well, what fixes are on-deck vs. long term, the game devs road map for progression, and highly active and public support from staffers.  Tech support is usually within 24 hours (the high volume around major patch days are obviously slower) and QA / Marketing members are active in streaming, vid casting, and the in game global chat.

												Take the time to learn this game.  Its mechanics are slightly different from many other DCGs you may be familiar with but its worth the while.I downloaded this game a long time ago but the mechanics seemed complicated so I set it aside.  Recently I decided to put forth the effort to learn how to play it and now its my go-to DCG.Its very F2P friendly once you get a little skill at Rift Runs (draft mode - equivalent of Arena in Hearthstone).  I spent $10 but it was completely unnecessary as I constantly earn more free currency than I spend.			"

												As a player of Magic the Gathering, I always felt that MTG lacked depth because of it's singular approach of reducing your oppositions life pool to zero. I disregard decking as a legitimate method of winning because it is simply not as practical. Infinity Wars resolves this issue by adding the morale pool in addition to a life pool. This addition of a morale pool creates more opportunities for creative deck building. A defensive deck is as legitimate as an offensive build. The simultaneous turns also improves the flow of the game and creates some interesting possibilities. The Gameplay is solid and the Free to Play structure is done well and allows a player to enjoy without paying, although buying items in the store is tempting for the same reason I have amassed giant MTG collections. The art direction is visually pleasing and the animated cards communicate the idea of the art well, both humorous and serious  ideas come across well.			"

												Great game, the devs really made this game addictive. The cards are animated :D and the gameplay is like Magic and Pokemon TCG?????? combined together. There are multiple play styles you can choose from and you can create custom decks :D The main downside currently right now (its still in early access lol) is obtaining cards, takes forever to grind for packs DX. But it isn't THAT bad, all the packs can be obtainable for free despite the endless amount of grinding you need to get them and leveling up does get you booster packs too. Great start Lightmare Studios!			"

								I'm a former MTG player, and this game is hitting all the right notes in the same vein as that. Games are quick because of the simoultaneous turns, card effects are interesting, the random cards are a great plus, and it has Star Trek for some reason, so I can bring out a Klingon alongside my fantasy robots. Worth looking into if the annual DotP release isn't your thing.			"

								Having played many other Trading Card Games, Infinity Wars was a nice surprise. It offers a very unique experience that is enjoyable as well as challenging. The artwork and soundtrack are well done and compliment the game quite nicely. As far as learning curves go, it shouldn't take too long to start understanding the game, it helps to find a strategy that works for you. This is the first trading card game that I've seen to have a campagn, but it also has quick offline matches as well as multiplayer ones. Conclusion:If your looking for a free, unique Trading card game with nice graphics, nice soundtrack, and can be played both online (even has cross-platform multiplayer) and offline (campagn mode and quick matches), this is a great game to get! And after all, it is free so what are you waiting for? you shouldn't have been reading this message, you should've been downloading/playing this game!Rating:I give this game a 9/10			"

												As a player of Magic the Gathering, I always felt that MTG lacked depth because of it's singular approach of reducing your oppositions life pool to zero. I disregard decking as a legitimate method of winning because it is simply not as practical. Infinity Wars resolves this issue by adding the morale pool in addition to a life pool. This addition of a morale pool creates more opportunities for creative deck building. A defensive deck is as legitimate as an offensive build. The simultaneous turns also improves the flow of the game and creates some interesting possibilities. The Gameplay is solid and the Free to Play structure is done well and allows a player to enjoy without paying, although buying items in the store is tempting for the same reason I have amassed giant MTG collections. The art direction is visually pleasing and the animated cards communicate the idea of the art well, both humorous and serious  ideas come across well.			"

												First review. The reason I actually bothered to make a review is because, quite simply, I'm fed up with all the bugs. I've barely gotten any hours in and already had numerous crashes which dropped me from the game or playing the campaign. Obtained items have been missing from the inventory. Buffing a character leads to 'illegal card interaction, game will stop now' non-sense.Sure, the game is free. And one could argue that you're getting exactly what you're paying for. I dare say however, that if I'm investing my time to be entertained, the very least I'd want to see is a working game.Their entire business model is based on the premise of keeping you playing and then buying cards to play with. You'd think that they then ensure you atleast can actually play the game.			"

												Wait... I wasn't write any evaluations about this game? REALLY? I must repair that!I played this game before it come to steam, overseers section wasn't here yet! I spend twice more time than the steam counter actually show ;) .okey, so here's three reasons I put Infinity Wars on the podium of all TCG:------------------------------------1- The most Free To Play beyond all TCG!If you know a bit about Trading Card Games, you know it's one of the most expensive game style you can get. The well-knowed Magic The Gathering by example cost 3.5€ a booster of 15 cards (1 rare, 3 uncommons, 11 commons), and a competitive deck can cost 150€, then become outdated after 1 year.Analogical cards are also expensive: Hearthstone, Hex, Duel of Champions, Scroll, all of them request between 20 and 50€, with the same problem of rotation.Infinity Wars is totally free! Not because of the exigence of the collection or the deckbuilding performance, but because of the accessibility of the packs. You can complete the entire collection in one year. In comparison, a FTP player in HEX is only happy to get all double-shards at this moment (Unless he played 10 hours/days ^^ ).And if you wish play a good builded deck, you can try a free weekly one enought fine to beat ""Metagame"" (if there are one...).Players generally spend money for alternate art cards or battlefields, and that work: Paradoxally, I spend more money on this game than the other TCG (15€ on IW, 5€ on DoC, 3€ on Heatstone). A good confidence and respect for Lightmare Studio.----------------------------------------------------2- Simultaneous turn!That's the best point of this game: you play your turn IN THE SAME TIME of your opponent. You have 3 minutes to manage your turn, 5 if you request more times (limited to 3 requests). You opponent do the same, then everything is resolved at the same time (Be careful of the initiative rule! All beginners make the mistake).So you can manage, organize, planify, expect: you must be confident in your reflection AND your intuition! in fact, the intuition is here an important factor and you can win even in a bad situation due to a careless and overconfident opponent or due to a excessive prudence and unconfident of this one. Bluff is also a big tactic (exept for brainless sligh deck, but... meh, they are easy to counter).That also why all beginners are dissuaded by this game, felling ""too complex"", but... really, after passed the first impression, you will love it!----------------------------------------------------3- original mechanism, great combinason of deckbuildingAs I said, there are not really ""metagame"" in Infinity Wars. of course, there are some Legendary spoiling cards, but they are easy to get (thank to the draft) and are not sign of victory (Don't cry on ""The Calamity"", it's just a MTG ""Wraith of god"" or a HEX ""Extinction"", very expensive to cast and predictible (When you see your opponent get 11 ressources, you can expect it)).The deck building is based on ""Purity rule"", to resume:* There are actually 8 factions on this game.* You can put 3 commanders. each commander represent one faction purity.* You can put more commander of the same faction for more purity, from 1 (3 factions) to 3 (pure faction).Each faction have their mechanisme, combine faction and purity is interesting to build combo idea or particular mechanism. You have 8 faction of 3 purity, so 119 combinations possible! (8 faction mean 8 "" pure faction (3 purities)"", 7x8 ""2 factions (2 purity on one faction + 1 purity on a second faction)"" and 55 ""3 factions"" (1 purity on each faction).In comparison, in Magic or Hex, you have 5 colours, that mean you can play until 31 combinations of colours (5 one-colours, 10 bi-colours, 10 tri-colours, 5 quadra-colours, 1 pentacolour).The unique problem of this game is... may player are intimidated by this special rule and don't try at least to evolve or experiment a bit... so come! We need more people! :D			"

Upvoted... for nowI do have to admit, Infinity Wars is a very unique and entertaining game. The simultaneous turn-based system is definitely one-of-a-kind, introducing a whole new level of both strategy and luck, the two most important factor in competitive card game genre. The factions are well developed, each with their distinctive strengths and weaknesses. I have enjoyed this game for about two years, and I still come back whenever I can.Unfortunately, things were not as good as it used to be. Descendants of the Dragons faction is constantly blamed for being too overpowered, an opinion I also share. The Avatars are way too strong. Some factions are downright weaker than the others - in this kind of game, it is very important to keep things ""different,"" instead of either ""superior"" or ""inferior."" The Star Trek collaboration was somewhat brilliant, but Klingon faction is perhaps a bit too strong. The new campaign system is bland to say the least. The list goes on.Still, I believe that Infinity Wars can be improved, as it was first introduced. I'm counting on it. Hence the upvote... for now.			"

The animations add a coolness factor everybody has access to without having to pay a premium.  The simultaneous turn structure is elegant and plays extremely well.  This is by far my favorite online CCG offering and holds up well when compared to my favorite live CCG, Magic (whose digital offering is worse than IW.  By a lot.)			"

												This game has finally done what every other online tcg should have been doing from the beginning; every single card is animated. I actually enjoy just looking through and appreciating the awesome art work and watching the cool little animations. I also really love how every deck feels completely broken when it goes off; It's a total power trip!One of my favorite and most unique features is when you play a location card and your side of the board transforms to match it; it looks awesome! The different factions each represent different deck strategies that you're probably familiar with. The flame Dawn Army is your Big Red Aggro deck, playing a lot of fast creatures to win the game before your opponent can stabilize. Genesis Industries is a robot synergy deck that lets you play cheap guys who eat each other to get bigger. The Warpath uses really cheap big guys to smash through your opponent's creatures and in to the win zone. The Cult of Verore is a control deck that makes it's own creatures stronger by killing yours. The Descendants of the Dragon is a turbo fog control deck that uses all kinds of defenses to frustrate your opponent until you literally win the game by draining his morale or playing a giant unstoppable dragon. The sleepers of Avarrach is one of the best, coolest and most viable zombie decks of any tcg I've seen. Using recursion and graveyard effects to help you amass an overwhelming horde of the undead. The Exiles are demons who reward you when you discard cards from your hand or sacrifice creatures. All in all, you should DEFINITELY check out this game; if only to see the cards.			"

								Infinity Wars is a great game if you are into CCGs. There are some nice twists to the original formula known from the likes of Magic: The Gathering. The cards are beautiful and animated which is a first as far as I know. ALL cards that can be used for ranked play can be gathered without paying real money. Even some easy to get early cards allow for some strong competitive decks. The devs are active and there have already been 2 new sets released. New sets are scheduled every 3 months and so far all of them can be bought with ingame money. There is a nice single player campaign and cool academy missions which help you with the rules and building a card stock.All in all I had a very fun experience playing this game the last week.Btw, here is my universal invite code, which you can type in while registering: 2B2C8  This will give both of us some extra ingame currency.

												I´m not a big strategist and not even an expert at this game or anything, but, dude, this game is so much fun. You see, by playing MTG online you don´t have too many possibilities for collecting cards and building decks, and Heartstone dont have the cool mechanics from Magic, so... Infinity Wars! The library of cards is huge and  you can mix ALL the factions in so many possibilities with the three commanders system, it´s like, you can come up with a new strategy to test everytime you get a new card! The game has a lot of bugs, even during matches (that will make you lose the game sometimes), but it doesn´t ruin the experience for me. If you´re too competitive and isn´t willing to spend money on it, i don´t recommend this game. It takes a long time and a lot of patience to build a good deck without paying, so if winning and having the ways to get all the cards you want is a big deal for you, it´s not really that much fun. But you see, if you login every day the games gives at least one booster every week, so if you love to collect cards like me, loves the thrill of getting a card you wanted on a booster you worked so hard to get and gets REALLY EXCITED when the deck you´ve been working on for the last week with a weird combination of factions turns out to have a good strategy, start playing right now, cause this game is awesome.

												1-) Best Alternative TCG to Hearthstone 2--) Easy to pick up impossible to master3---) Great Meta throughout all Rankings 4----) Not pay to win; but incentives purchases  1) Infinity wars is imo one of the greatest cult classics among the lesser well known tcgs. (Hearthstone being the most popular as to exclude it) And other tcgs come close to it imo such as Hex : Shards of fate, Solforge, M&M, MTG; Although out of these i found that Infinity wars did not seem too convoluted in its system design; it was easy to pick up but hard to master. This was due to the almost gambling like turn system; where each players turns ended only when they accepted it. And when this happened, both players turns happened simultaneously. So in this perspect you can place some of your more valuable cards in safer zone. Pre-emptive moves among other intresting targeted spells would play together in this mash of motions.2) The reason that it was easy to pickup and impossible to master was the fact that you were given the basic deck of cards from each faction upon completing its faction campaign. (more of an extended tutorial if you will) Which served as your barebones skeleton of to which build upon; and if you so fancied the starter deck expands upon this. Although it feels more like an intermediate deck of which stacks on your barebares campaign deck. It was also very plentiful with the amount of card packs it gave early on. (as level up gave card packs) Thus by the time you hit around lvl 10 you should have had plenty of cards of which you felt were very strong to compete with. And as the TCG mantra goes; more cards; more possiblities.3) The meta of the game very deep and rich to say the least. This is because certain deck types almost always counter another deck type. And thus you had to either make you decks strengths more apparent, or your weaknesses less apparent. A good deck can get you carried higher in the ranks but as peoples understanding these inherent ideas grow; decks became harder and harder to counter. And thus there was always this arms race of sorts to pump up the RNG gods (random number game = equivlent to lady luck)4)As stated earlier the reason this was not pay to win was becuase you were given the barebones of which to work with. And given pleniful amount of packs which slowed down as your cards grew from level ups (higher level = slower level up). Meaning that your earned currency to buy cards become more valuable and thus the payed currency. But this was fine as you will have amassed more cards when this spike occurs. Although the missing powerhouse in your decks made you crave more cards as a result.9/10			"

								This game has a really nice balance and a lot of depth to the strategy. I used to play Magic a few years back (it got too expensive to keep up) and while this has some similarities, I think I might actualyl prefer the style of Infinty Wars. I've seem some complaints that this is ""pay to win"", but have not found that to be the case. After going through just 2 of the single-player campaigns (there's one for each faction) and about half of the academy tutorials, I've accumulated enough booster packs to build some fairly formidable decks. Deck building definitely gets addictive and there's great nuances to balancing your card selections, especially when you start mixing more than one faction into a single deck. I'm not usually too big on multiplayer games, but really enjoy the PvP in this. Matchmaking is quick and the games have a great pace. Overall a great game, my only gripe so far is that the in-game currency is slow to accumulate versus the real Lightmare currency that costs actual dollars. I've logged about 10 hours of game time and amy barely even halfway towards being able to buy a booster pack with in-game currency. However, I've mostly been playing Academy and Campaign single-player matches, and it looks like the standard PvP gives you about double the currency of the single-player matches, so that's a plus. Anyway, its free to play, so try it already!			"

								Infinity Wars is a great game if you are into CCGs. There are some nice twists to the original formula known from the likes of Magic: The Gathering. The cards are beautiful and animated which is a first as far as I know. ALL cards that can be used for ranked play can be gathered without paying real money. Even some easy to get early cards allow for some strong competitive decks. The devs are active and there have already been 2 new sets released. New sets are scheduled every 3 months and so far all of them can be bought with ingame money. There is a nice single player campaign and cool academy missions which help you with the rules and building a card stock.All in all I had a very fun experience playing this game the last week.Btw, here is my universal invite code, which you can type in while registering: 2B2C8  This will give both of us some extra ingame currency.

												I did like it at first, but the single player was greatly toned down recently. Albeit the fact that the new single player is a bit more user-friendly, it's not so hard hitting--you are babied into playing Infinity Wars. Also it is much smaller than before. Multiplayer is good for the most part. You get cards when leveling up and you can also buy them.  However, don't expect to get anything besides cards for free. Card backs, game textures, and avatars all require you to spend real money for them, which is a big con compared to games like Hearthstone. A few pluses to mention. All cards are animated and the game has great music!Keeping this review slim. TL,DR: No cosmetics are free, no singleplayer. Animated cards are cool, but better off playing Hearthstone unless you really, REALLY like multiplayer card games.			"

There is NO limit to how many different decks you can build and save, so you can customize and try out new ideas as much as your heart desires.The simultaneous turns takes a little getting used to, but allow for some really unique plays.Free to play aspect is solid. 1 card for logging in daily, 1 card for 3 games played daily, weekly quests, free packs on leveling up, and in game currency for playing matches. Has drafting which can earn you good rewards if you do well. Unranked matches are Bo1 with no sideboardRanked Matches are Bo3 with sideboard. "

You can always trade with other players.Don't blame you lose on pvp because he got more legendary cards.Blame yourself that you so easy to giveup on challenge.			"

												Sadly, this game isn't worth it in its current state.It lloks like a good game as a ""Magic lite"", rules feel simple enough to understand while leaving room for more complex interactions.However I couldn't go very far into the game due to bugs. Game progress isn't saved anymore for 2-3 weeks now, so progressing in the campaign isn't possible at the moment. That, combined with UI bugs show the QA is unsufficient.Moreover, there are no added value using Steam:- you need to create an account- you need to manually login each time you start the game (no option to remember the passowrd)- and the login is way too slow compared to other games.

												the game just feels cheap compared to some of its competitors.  understably, as this company is much smaller, as well as their budget.  but there's a sort of disconnect between the game: whether it be the ui, gameplay, music, art design, etc, everything is at odds with each other.  a few features feel like they were thrown in for the sake of ""being different"", which ends up diminshing the integrity of the game.is it the best tcg on steam? eh, still think might and magic is slightly ahead.  but certainly debatable.best digital tcg on the market? resounding no.  Hex: Shards of Fate is, and I encourage everyone to check it out.  It's in closed beta, but there are ways to get beta keys/invites.  to properly appreciate/evaluate a tcg/ccg you have to play them all, and i have.			"

												Scummish company, who do not fix bugs. The game is also too fidgety and there is no simple way to learn the game. Also due the amount of high ranked players, playing ranked is virtually impossible as there are only around fifty people on at one time and forty of them have every single card in the game. Most of my time has been in the standalone launcher (Around one hundred hours) which is very poor in terms of performance. Feels laggy when using it, even when on the same computer.			"

								When i hear first time, there is another games TCG, i not impresive. Magic already do that in steam since 2012, i try some in 2013 edition, and really disappointment.But since it Free to Play i give some shot. And the result, i really enjoy this games. They bring TCG in ew mechanism, use digital power to bring something we cannot image before. They know, waiting game really annoying in Online game, they make it Real Turn. And keep the strategic value what we TCG Player really love.They make good tutorial, any many game modes, even this still Beta. Also i need to mention, this game not Pay 2 Win, like mostly F2P games.The battle is awesome and briliant.Deck Making UI is still in progress i think, but already quite good. ===Since this still Beta, some not yet optimizedIf you progress far in game, you will find its hard to target card cause too many card.... i really hope they find it. Or make it stack same card without different attribute like Magic do.So far, that problem i find, and i believe they still improve this game, so i dont mind much.===If you looking Great TCG right now, Try this game, you will not regret.I already try Heartstone too, but i more hook to this game.TLDR, try it, it really Great TCG Games			"

												I work as a professional audio engineer, and the voice over work in this game is abysmal. There are plosives, lots of mouth and tongue clicks (aka mouth noise), and every voice sounds like it was recorded on totally different equipment. Most likely they just hired low cost voice over people from the internet, and each one is using a different standard of equipment. Acting is also sub par. I would have rather had no voices that distracting, low quality voices. Additionally, there are various typos throughout the system. The most obvious one I saw was the word 'availiable' (yes, with two 'i's) in the opening tutorial. Nice.On to game play, I'm a long time TCG player of various games, and this one is just a cheap knock off of Hearthstone, which is already a fairly boring game for those who are used to more complex and exciting games like MTG. Game play itself is marred by a very confusing turn system (which is unexplained and un-intuitive to new comers). I found myself stuck on the tutorial level where it says 'attack with all' and there is simply no button that says 'attack' or 'proceed' or 'go'. The fact that I have to carefully scan the screen for several minutes, check the options menu, and finally just give up shows a complete failure in this aspect.It's pretty clear the developers here only cared for making shiny graphics and animations, and cared nothing for the audio, the user interface, or even proper spelling.

Completing a mission within the campaign will give you a reward; usually a card or cards. By completing the campaign, you will end up with several cards to use for making many different kinds of decks. The game has many modes for playing against other players. This combined with the many kinds of decks you can make after completing the campaign allows for many hours of play.			"

												I can't believe I had to find this thing out from the Steam reccomendations page. This game should be talked about far more widely. If you enjoy magic or any similar card games, please try this out, it needs far more love. It is free to play, but not pay to win, as a glance at the store can tell you. The in game currency is handed out pretty regularly, the only pay exclusive items are for appearance (card backs, backgrounds). The campaign itself is wonderfully well made, with the the early stages teaching you how to play the deck the campaign is based around, and later stages relying on you coming up with interesting card combinations to win an otherwise one sided fight. The art is great, the game balance (as far as I can tell so far) is damn well done, and the updates seem regular. Please give it a try!UPDATE: As an update: 2 months in of playing it practically everyday, and it still hasn't gotten old. Finished the entire campaign, which teaches you rather well how to play each faction and various deck strategies they use. The AI opponents are rather dumb once you play against them enough, but PVP is very fun, and not the least bit stressfull. Even if you lose, you still get way more experience and cash than the AI would give you, and its very quick and easy to play the 3 games you need to get the second free card a day. With weekly quests to give you more free cards, and the 2 daily ones having a chance of being anything from a common to an epic (got 2 already this way), it never feels like you're stagnating. You can always build new decks and try new strategies, it doesn't hurt you to lose (in unranked anyway), and if you don't feel like that, there are always the rotating decks to try out, with varying difficulties of use. So to reiterate, if you like card games, play it!			"

												I've played very little, but I really liked it. It has its own niche of a playstyle, quite similar to Yu-gi-Oh (a game which I absolutely adore).This game has a lot of potential and I love the way the game itself plays out. Granted I have my disagreements with some of the gameplay elements, but you can't love it all. It certainly doesn't break my Hearth like Cardstone does though. It doesn't try to kick me when I lose by also giving me nothing from card packs. That's of course after Cardstone opened a fresh wound with RNG and poured salt in it. Enough of Hearthstone though.With a heavy heart I must say that I sadly can't recommend it to almost anyone I know. The artstyle is good, I love the design, but the battlefield, the animations and the soundeffects are sub-par AT BEST. They're simply horrible. Calling them stock would be doing them too much justice. There are top notch free sound effects available out there and this game doesn't seem to be using any. Either that or my game is just broken. It really erodes away the sheer gameplay potential of the game as its feel is so dull I can't force myself to launch it.Once the animations and more importantly sound effects are fixed, the game will be MUCH less annoying. Right now it just has a complete lack of visual and audial charm.I know it's hard designing quality animations and fitting proper sound effects, different ones for each card, also making the game much bigger in the process, but if it's done in the future, I'll change my view to a Recommend.

												Pro:-awesome concept-amazing strategic possibilitys-just wonderfull artstyle and desing of the cards-playing agains AI is really funny and very enjoyableContra:-Bad Tutorials-Worst Matchmaking (u will only play agains Pros)-Quests, Reward and all that stuff is bugged as hell-WAY TOO HARD FOR BEGINNERSIn the End this is an awesome Game to play for urself or if u want to challenge your friends.BUT if u are not that fammiliar with card games, this one is probably the worst and hardest to start. It´s hard as hell, the campaign and Tutorials are teaching u by the Try and Error Concept and if u fail u have to restart the hole match. This can get really ennoying and is not helpfull at all. I woul rather add the possibility to undo a round in the campain missions (except for the boss fights).I really wanted to give this game a positive Review cause its a pretty unique one, but i just can´t:I had a really great time and loads of fun, but imagine u are new to the PvP Mode and then u are just playing agains pros wich know every single card in the game. U just don´t stand a chance and get fustrated very fast.So why are the devs not improving this?Cuz u can buy card packs and card decks!You will see all those cool high lvl players reking you with ther high end ultra rare cards ( :D) and then you want to be as good as them. So you gonna go to the store searching for cards and u willl find out that a new deck costs 10€.This is how they make u pay.And if they would fix the matchmaking they wouldn´t sell anything anymore.Puffy this game! ;)			"

								i love this game!  I have been playing CCGs since Magic the gathering 4th edition came out.  Most recently I played a big name digital card by Blizzard, which i was very disappointed with.  Infinity Wars is the whole package.  Fun gameplay, fantastic card animations, and a HUGE library of cards.Now some specifics:1) there is a fantastic campaign mode that quickly gets you starter sets for every faction in the game, enabling you to quickly begin trying all the factions out to see what kind of decks you might like.2) I felt like I was always unlocking new cards.  after only playing for 4 days I have over 600 cards.3) There is never any need to spend real money on this game.  you can unlock every card just by playing the game.4) You get a random card just for logging in every day.  that card can be any card and rarity.  from common to legendary.5) Theres a reward for playing 3 games in a day, and weekly quests as well.6) You get rewarded for playing against your friends.  More xp, more in game currency, and more cards.7) This is the first digital CCG I have played that actually feels good to play on the computer.  In fact the game itself would not work as a tabletop game. Thats because...8)  Each player plays cards at the same time!  Let me explain.  each turn you have about 2 minutes to spend your resources to summon you characters, use special abilities, attack your foe and defend yourself.  Once you have done everything you want for the turn you simply push the ""end turn"" button. While you have been doing everything listed above so has your opponent, so when you both push ""end turn"" the uniqueness of simultanious play really shines.  every happens in a specific order for both characters at the same time, allowing for bluffing, tricking, trapping and utterly destorying your foe in fun new ways not possible in traditional card games.Now for some of not so good things about infinity wars:1) this is most definatly still a beta version of the game.  it crashes, it gltches, cards will be covered by other text, some cards abilities act a little wonky.  the game still has some bugs for sure, but even with its technical issues it is still worth playing.2) the card library needs some work.  when you go in to find a card there are some helpful search options to find what your looking for, but there needs to be more.  there needs to be an option to look up cards by special ability and by resource cost.  you can llok up cards by faction, by type of card, and by which set of cards its from; but with the amount of cards in the game there needs to be a better way to narrow it down.3) This game needs more players!  I dont know how many people are currently playing, but there have been a few times when Ive tried to play some PVP matches and it took 3-5 minutes to find someone to play against.4) It seems to take lots of in game currency to buy anything.  it costs 5200 points to buy a boster of cards that comes with 15 cards.  you get at most 75 points after playing a bot, or 150 for beating a pvp match.  if its your friend you both get 150 win or lose.  you need to play 70 bots minimum to get a booster or 35 pvp matches.  In my opinion you should be able to get a booster in half that many games.so there you have it.  dispite some flaws that will hopefully be worked out as the game nears official release this is still the digital CCG to play.  Fast, fun, and unique in a way no other card game has every been.  Hope to see you on Infinity Wars!			"

								A good alternative to Hearthstone and MTG that features stunning card animations and very unique gameplay.Infinity Wars is an easy to learn but complex card game that focuses on winning in either two ways, destroy the enemy fortress (which has health) or kill enough of their minions and deplete enemy morale to zero, forcing their retreat. You choose 3 commanders, of whatever faction you wish, but depending on which cards you want to use, you will need a minimum amount of that factions commanders. An example would be having a specific faction card, lets say (Genesis) that requires you to have 2 of its factions commanders. For this card to be in your deck, you need 2 of those 3 required commanders to be of that faction, in this case Genesis. This allows for unique deck creation as you can have 1 commander from 3 different factions, allowing you to use faction cards with a required commander cost of 1, making it a unique and versatile deck. Or if your like me, use three commanders from the same faction and gain access to its extremely powerful cards.Very noob friendly with a long and informative tutorial that is completely optional to do, but I would highly recommend completing the first two sections to make sure you understand the game. The third is for more advanced play, and can take upwards of an hour to complete, due to learning how to use special game mechanics.To make sure you aren't getting destroyed, multiplayer VS people is disabled until you reach level 4, which will take roughly 1:30 - 2:00 hours to finish.There is a long campaign that is interesting and very fun, which allows you to play every faction in the game to better learn its playstyle and get comfortable with the cards they command. Or if you feel like killing computers for that much wanted experience, just play the AI over and over until you reach the required level.No Pay 2 Win, you can pay for decks and booster packs with real money or use the in game currency to buy cards. (like most online TGC) If you do choose to sink money into IW, the prices are very reasonable and you get a good amount of cards added to your collection.Low player base, as its probably not very popular with the current kings of cards being MTG and more recently, Hearthstone.If you were to ask me to explain Infinity Wars in a sentence, it would be (Its like the middle grounds of Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering: animated cards, complex at times, simple to learn and very fun to play)Personal Rating: 4/5			"

								Alot similiar to Hearthstone as they have a 30 card Sealed/Draft Format where you select 1 of 3 cards for your deck. You gain 1 resource a turn so no screwed games due to lack of resources. Pretty Balanced for as new as the game is as every single card has a use in a deck from what I have seen. The ability to have 3 commanders can be a little overpowered as some of them should be banned and not be commanders IMO. But I think its an upgraded version of hearthstone with a much larger selection of cards but instead of having class restrictions you have race restrictions which you can still create hybrid decks. Solid size enviorment I havent had any trouble finding a game in constructed or limited/draft I havent had to wait longer than 10 seconds for a game. Overall great game if you enjoy these type of card games and I strongly reccomend to anybody who enjoys hearthstone as its a step up. Game needs more advertisement though I think it has potential to be the best of its kind. Also message me if you enjoy this review and I can give you a reference code to play and it would help me out a ton :)			"

												Deepest CCG I've played in a long time. Fun for [filthy] casuals, but what kept me playing is the complexity of strategy that you can formulate to help you win games.I started the game, finished the tutorials, the campaign, and then took a weekly free deck (aka LoL) into Ranked (aka Not LoL) and had a pretty good winrate. Well how does the game play like? It's basically turn-based laning, thinking 'what will my opponent do next turn' and 'what can i do to best counter what he will do' ...and you may soon find that the little details like slightly different positioning is the difference between victory and defeat.The only reason why the score isn't in the high 90s is that the game was ""too hard"" for the 15% of people who don't recommend the game. Like any good PVP game, you will be punished for your misplays, filthy casuals! Seriously though, unless you're in the bottom 15% of the curve in Steam, you'll probably enjoy the game.			"

												I have to retract my last review because i made my account , they fixed the bug. The game reminds me of magic the gathering with a revamped battle system. Yes you can pay for cards and decks to get a quick leg up. But  It hasnt taken me that long to unlock good cards and build some decent decks. You can create a deck with multiple factions in one but you do have a limit to 3 purity slots. Thats fine though. I recomend playing the campaign before you start online play. Campaign mode can quickly unlock cards to build a nice deck. i like how the decks you can buy  with cash can also be bought with points you unlock by playing. I would greatly recomend this game to anyone even if they dont like card games. It has a puzzle element to it and a unique battle system that is smooth , easy to learn , and intense at times. Great job on this game for a free to play i give it   9/10 !!			"

								In a nutshell:  Infinity Wars is a great game, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting a deep strategy card experience.**At first I was playing Infinity Wars and Hearthstone, and I was vacillating between the two.  Then I gave Infinity Wars a dedicated afternoon, and that's all she wrote.  Now it's Infinity Wars and nothing else.When you first start playing you don't realize how many subtle mechanics there are that really allow a deep level of strategy and custom deck building.  Once you do; however, you quickly come to appreciate how intricate and sophisticated this game can be (and I mean that in a very good way!).  There are also a TON of cards and card combinations, so anyone who enjoys building a unique, custom deck is going to be in hog heaven.When you do give this game a try don't be put off by the generic feeling tutorial and beginner campaign decks.  These are simple on purpose I believe to ease beginners into the game.  Once you have the basics under your belt try searching the web for some custom deck ideas.  You'll quickly see the amazing amount of different ways you can put together a devious combination of cards to wreck havoc on your opponent.And did I mention the daily log in rewards, quests, tournaments, ranked play, leveling rewards, etc. etc.?  This game has a lot going for it to keep you engaged, and it's an indie title too boot.  You can't lose on that!So, in summary:  This is a fantastic game, and if you should definitely give it a shot.  I'll bet you'll be hooked in no time.  :)And feel free to hit me up for a game anytime.			"

												Infinity Wars is one of the greatest digital TCGs... scratch that.Infinity Wars is one of the greatest TCGs I have ever played, and I have played my fair share.This game is not for those who are only seeking a casual experience (seriously, go play Hearthstone or one of those web-based games), Infinity Wars has a great level of depth to the gameplay that can only be found in simultaneous turns. Imagine fusing competitive pokemon with its simultaneous turns (leading to prediction wars, 50/50s, and a very intense experience) with MTG (factions with very different tools that work together to create hundreds of possible strategies).Ok, so currently its not the most balanced game ever. The exiles faction is bothering many players with its RNG elements. HOWEVER this is not as serious a problem as many take it to be. This is not like Magic where any deck that isn't OP will never win. You can get by with a limited card pool without dropping $100 plus. This game is completely free to play. I haven't dropped a cent on this yet, although I do plan on doing so at some point to help out the developers.Speaking of limited card pools, those without a lot of Rare/Legendary/Epic cards can play ""paupers"" where only common and uncommon are allowed, or merged, where the two players divide their decks amongst each other. These have really long queues, however.There are a lot more features coming soon too, and IW2015 will be expanding on the already existing game. Team battles and other stuff are in the works, or so I hear.TL;DR Jus' get it. It gud an' free tu.			"

												At the time of this review i have logged 41 hours on this game. Infifnity Wars is an amazing tcg with new inivative mechanics combined with astounding animated are for each card. the turns are taken simaltainiously with both players having the same amount of rescources at the stard of the match, this game features a double win condidtion style of players which alters which faction and type of deck you play. This is what seperates this game from other tcgs.                     however it has 1 shortcoming- you need to spend a lot of time with this game to get anywhere in a pvp ranked envornment  (Without spending Money) this is because of the in-game Currency nothing really wrong with it except the average game win gives you 150-170 IP (Infinity Points) which would not be a problem if it were not for the OUTRAGOUS cost of a free to play pack at a whopping 5,400 IP which would mean i would need to win around 40 pvp matches to get even one. leveling gives you packs but with increasing amount of XP you need they are few and far apart. the paid price is reasonable at a $2.50 ratio and when you perchase the paid currency it gives you some IP as well depending on how much money you spend.                                     you could do an endless grind to get packs but the game feels like its pushing you to become a paid user and if you dont you fall behind because new sets are released at an average rate and cards that you own may become useless. also the cards you earn with Leveling up cannot be traded. trading in this game is hard to do because of the tier list that are mademany poeple ive traded with use different tier lists so card value feels non-existant at best. (this of corse depends on who you trade with.) Its fun to play and i'd recommend it for any TCG player 8/10			"

								The closest game i know to infinity wars is mtg yet I would say that doesnt even describe infinity wars well enough its got a huge potential for strategy within it and it is definately fun and rewarding. beating each level of a campaign gives you a card or almost enough cards for a deck. leveling gives you boosters and within the match you can use a trading post with your card resources to help you out but at the cost of not being able to play as many cards that turn.Truely a fun game and i hope the developers consider making the game in real life as well i would definately aim to collect all the cards			"

								This game is absolutely amazing. I'm a MtG veteran (over 10 years of playing Magic the Gathering) and I never saw a PC card game made so amazingly good. Lately I tried Heartstone just to be seriously dissapointed by it - mostly becasue of the poor mechanics (game is very, very random - and card rarity driven). Although playing for free in Heartstone was perfectly possible it's nowhere near the complexity and strategic depth of Infinity Wars.I'm in total amazement, how small group of people could make something better than Blizzard. I recommend this to all card game lovers, and to people who like to think while playing. For extra currency and cards use 700C2 code while creating an account.			"

												After 90 hours of playing, I come to the conclusion that this game is a really well thought-out one. By design, balance and pay2win aspects.Design: Organised HUD, easy overview, memorable music and nice animations for each cardBalance: Due to the Meta, rush based decks are a little stronger than stalling decks but balance retains stable overall.Pay2Win: Basically, none. The things that can be bought by LP (Lightmare points) only are cosmetics. Card packs and starter decks are both bought by real and ingame currency.I really haven't seen a cardgame like this and is has much much potential. I expect it to grow and become more popular in time.Now there are some negative aspects too. First off, you'll have a hard time as a beginner. The game has a lot of mechanics to learn, and that could take a while. And once you're done with all campaigns and bot battles you want to gather some cards and for that you gotta farm.Also matchmaking does a wierd job sometimes for beginners.Still, once you're past the newbie-status you can fully enjoy this game to your heart's content			"

								Awesome Game probably the best Digital TCG I have played, compared to Hearthstone it is much more competitve in nature. The game has more of a  strategy and prediction aspect with their simulatneous action phases. Infinity War's has an extensive card collection already and enough factions to keep people interested. Overall I really enjoy this game, especially for anybody that felt Hearthstone may have been a bit to childish or not competitve enough it seems as if Lightmare will be supporting the competitive community in their game.The rules are fairly simple and easy to pick up especially for anybody used to playing tcg's such as magic. The Art on the cards is great and while some of the animations are a bit lack luster some are also fantastic. Playerbase is beyond great all of the older players are helpful and support the new players with what they can and I haven't seen any rude players yet. Lightmare is being very open and clear about their plans for the game without giving to much away which I like as well.Overall : 8.5/10 would definatly give it a try!			"

												Simultaneous turns? That alone makes this at least worth trying in my opinion.The interface is a bit clunky and getting new cards can feel like a real grind at times, but the actual deckbuilding and gameplay are sound and fairly deep. Aside from that, it's free, and like many online card games, improves on some of the flaws of older games like Mt:G (mana, oh god mana).			"

												OVERALL: One of the most engaging and best card games out there. If you're looking for something fresh that is not a yet another reskin of MTG with minor gameplay changes, give this game a shot. It's only 1GB and it's free, you're not losing anything if you don't like it.Even though the playerbase is pretty small right now, the other players are really newbie friendly and the game itself lets every player access 5 ''competetive'' decks for free each week, meaning that most of the time even if you are matched with a veteran (and you will, trust me) you still stand a chance. The mechanics are very hard to compare to most online TCGs out there, but they probably come closest to Duels of Champions, with more flexible lanes, the ability to mix factions and, most importantly, simultaneous turns. This means that you not only need to plan your own turn, but also predict what the enemy will do! Once youre both done, all the actions will be played in order, meaning that it's possible to literally dodge out of spells way. There is also a ton of cards available, which is extremely impressive given the fact that they're all nicely animated.Graphically this game is the best looking one out there, even Hearthstone doesn't come close with it's production values. Each card is animated and while on some it's just a minor detail, some are truly impressive. There is quite a lot of grind to get cards without paying, but it's possible, especially if you play the draft mode. The developers are working on a solution to it, so you may want to hold on for a bit if that really puts you off.Downsides? Well, the playerbase is quite small right now, meaning that you'll run into strong players a lot. Personally I like that as it's a proper challenge and I'm still doing just fine, even though I only started this week. Does take a lot of practice and reading though as well as some imagination when you need to guess what they'll do next.			"

Booster packs are randomly obtained from completing missions conataining goodies for you to enjoy. These 'trading card' games have never really appealed to me however this one has caught me off guard and I'm really hoping to enjoy many hour on this and most likely splash a bit of cash on the variety of card pack that it includes. If you're not sure weather or not this is any different to games of this genre then there isn't a need to worry, this brings complete re-skins and stratagy like i've never seen before.

								If you have any mind in card collecting and strategy games either as a hobbiest or just casually give this one a look! EVERY card pack and card is availible for in game currancy that is fairly easy to obtain as well as your 2 daily chances to get any card in the game for free. I was never one for games like Magic and other card games due to them requireing so much money to play them well. This one shatters that generalization. I encourage you to give it a look, as well as the cards having unique animations as well as a truly engauging combat turn system when both opponants secretly make thier moves at the same time and then the actions play out as turn resolves. This creates a game of luck, skill, and hope that your opponant hasn't foiled your master play. Give it a look!			"

								This is the first dTCG that I have truly enjoyed.  Despite being in Beta, the gameplay is quick and solid. You won't run into performance issues running the game.  The simultaneous turns add a deeper intuitive element to the game.  In fact, rather than being merely strategic like most trading card games, this game employs actual tactics. Another part that astounds me is that your instincts will actually kick in after you have accumulated enough experience playing the game, much like in action or shooter games.

												Now, I'm not one for writing these reviews in all honesty, but I feel the need to write something for a game that I've been pretty faithful to lately, I was playing the Beta and I was practically addicted to it during that time, I would refuse to turn off my laptop in order to play a game or two. I personally love this game, I love all the different factions and their own unique playstyles, And how almost every deck has counter-play right now, they are fairly balanced at this point in time. If you're looking for a genuine free to play game, this is one that you'll enjoy. While I can say that it gets a little tedious at times trying to get the packs you need for new cards, but that's where I like the 'Master & Apprentice' system, it's basically a system where you can play with someone you've met, or invited to the game to be either your Master or Apprentice, and for each 15 minutes of play in game with that person, you both get a 'blister pack', you also gain all the rewards of playing an actual PvP game, but you get to play it with a friend! Oh how glorius this it! XD (Sorry for my poor English at points, It's not my 'native' tongue.)			"

								This game is very good, it has unique combat system, technique, awesome graphics and cards animations, unlike any other games in it's genre when playing Infinity Wars you gotta think about your strategy and you can't just play random cards, you have to pay attention to small detail. I'll recommend this game to people who are willing to take their time and learn the game (and there's quite a bit, not so hard though), on the other hand if you're looking to spend sometime on an easy tgc this may not be the game for you.

								Let it be known I am already a fan of ccg. That being said, Infinity wars has a lot to offer any strategy minded individual. As a ccg it has some interesting features, bearing familiar elements for those adept with ccg already. There are 7 main factions, a unallied faction whose cards can be included in any deck, and of course, the amazing Star Trek expansion. Deck building is virtually unrestricted - a legal deck must have three 'Commander' cards, which determine the types of cards you can include in your deck, and at least 40 cards.  Each card has an affinity cost, and as long as you have enough generals of the appropriate type in your command slot, you can put that card in your deck. A maximum of three copies of any card can be included, but you can break that rule by also putting those cards in your command zone (protip). There are also unlimited cards, which as their nomiker indicates, can be included in any number.   Now where IW excels is that, while rare or epic cards can seriously affect the battlefield, some of the most effective decks I've run or come across use common, or even unlimited cards. I've had marked success in both ranked mode and tournament play, which are single pvp battles. These are further restricted by set types, including five different types of deck restrictions. Within these, if you are concerned about pay-to-win decks, there is even a merged deck mode, which shuffles both players card sources together, theoretically limiting the effectiveness of people with scads of cash. However, the game is balanced enough (imo) to not require such drastic measures. The draft mode as well is extremely fun, and also (if you do well) seems to be the best mode of earning the in game currency. Drafting players select three commanders from 3 4 card choices, and then draft a deck from cards that will come up in the same 4 card options. This means 0 wait time, as you are not dependant on other players to make desicions, you just draft, and then can queue up for matches at your own convenience. 3 losses and you are out, but the better you do, the more you earn. Once you accumulate 3 losses the game offers you the choice to purchase your deck, with cost reductions based on how well you did, and taking your entry fee into account. Anything purchasable in the game can be bought with the silver coins you earn from playing the game normally (infinity points) or by purchasing Lightmare points (terrible name) with actual cash. While grinding infinity points, apart from draft, is sloooooooooow, (more o's are really needed, but just imagine them) that is hopefully due to the fact that the game is still in Beta. No good getting people all jacked out too soon as of yet is the reasoning I figure. That being said, after beating the campaign mode, the tutorial/challange mode, and participating in 2 drafts, I have close to 600 cards. That's a lot of options. This game packs in a ton of great features for being free. I downloaded it about a week ago, have a full time job, and have still logged 50+ hours. I have not regretted the ZERO dollar investiment, and it's pebbles to download. I run it in windowed mode with an average pc, and can still do whatever else I like while I destroy people in pvp. If you like strategy games, get this. If you like ccg, you are actually missing out if you don't start playing this. Immediately. This is already way too long (most have you have stopped reading) but if you still are, one final note. I have spent all my in game cash on booster packs of Star Trek, b/c hell yeah Star Trek. So far I've managed to peel Commander Riker, Data twice, and mother-trucking Q himself. Now I ask, and tell me true - Why WOULDN'T you want to play a  card game where you can play WIll Riker and beat people down with him? Why?			"

								This is a great TCG. If you are a fan of ""Magic the Gathering"", you will love this. I would go so far as to say it is much better. The stratagy involved is far supierior. The fact that this game was designed as a digital TCG allows it to use mechanics that would never work with a a real world TCG the biggest being the turn system (which I freaking love). I won't go into all the details/rules of the game that make it great as I am sure you can read it n their website or watch a youtube video.You can easily play this game without spending a dime and have tons of fun without being stomped all the time. If you did feel like supporting the game and its developers the prices are far from outrageous. Compared to ""MtG"" and ""Yu-gi-oh"" the booster packs are no more expensive and the premade decks seem far cheaper. They update often and are always working on new cards and game modes to keep things fresh and interesting.  I played ""MtG"" for years and was blown away by how great this game is instantly and it took me like a fever. It's hands down the best TCG I've ever played digital or realworld. 10/10			"

								If you have any mind in card collecting and strategy games either as a hobbiest or just casually give this one a look! EVERY card pack and card is availible for in game currancy that is fairly easy to obtain as well as your 2 daily chances to get any card in the game for free. I was never one for games like Magic and other card games due to them requireing so much money to play them well. This one shatters that generalization. I encourage you to give it a look, as well as the cards having unique animations as well as a truly engauging combat turn system when both opponants secretly make thier moves at the same time and then the actions play out as turn resolves. This creates a game of luck, skill, and hope that your opponant hasn't foiled your master play. Give it a look!			"

								This is the first dTCG that I have truly enjoyed.  Despite being in Beta, the gameplay is quick and solid. You won't run into performance issues running the game.  The simultaneous turns add a deeper intuitive element to the game.  In fact, rather than being merely strategic like most trading card games, this game employs actual tactics. Another part that astounds me is that your instincts will actually kick in after you have accumulated enough experience playing the game, much like in action or shooter games.  I highly recommend this game.			"

								Awesome Game probably the best Digital TCG I have played, compared to Hearthstone it is much more competitve in nature. The game has more of a  strategy and prediction aspect with their simulatneous action phases. Infinity War's has an extensive card collection already and enough factions to keep people interested. Overall I really enjoy this game, especially for anybody that felt Hearthstone may have been a bit to childish or not competitve enough it seems as if Lightmare will be supporting the competitive community in their game.The rules are fairly simple and easy to pick up especially for anybody used to playing tcg's such as magic. The Art on the cards is great and while some of the animations are a bit lack luster some are also fantastic. Playerbase is beyond great all of the older players are helpful and support the new players with what they can and I haven't seen any rude players yet. Lightmare is being very open and clear about their plans for the game without giving to much away which I like as well.Overall : 8.5/10 would definatly give it a try!			"

												Deepest CCG I've played in a long time. Fun for [filthy] casuals, but what kept me playing is the complexity of strategy that you can formulate to help you win games.I started the game, finished the tutorials, the campaign, and then took a weekly free deck (aka LoL) into Ranked (aka Not LoL) and had a pretty good winrate. Well how does the game play like? It's basically turn-based laning, thinking 'what will my opponent do next turn' and 'what can i do to best counter what he will do' ...and you may soon find that the little details like slightly different positioning is the difference between victory and defeat.The only reason why the score isn't in the high 90s is that the game was ""too hard"" for the 15% of people who don't recommend the game. Like any good PVP game, you will be punished for your misplays, filthy casuals! Seriously though, unless you're in the bottom 15% of the curve in Steam, you'll probably enjoy the game.			"

								Alot similiar to Hearthstone as they have a 30 card Sealed/Draft Format where you select 1 of 3 cards for your deck. You gain 1 resource a turn so no screwed games due to lack of resources. Pretty Balanced for as new as the game is as every single card has a use in a deck from what I have seen. The ability to have 3 commanders can be a little overpowered as some of them should be banned and not be commanders IMO. But I think its an upgraded version of hearthstone with a much larger selection of cards but instead of having class restrictions you have race restrictions which you can still create hybrid decks. Solid size enviorment I havent had any trouble finding a game in constructed or limited/draft I havent had to wait longer than 10 seconds for a game. Overall great game if you enjoy these type of card games and I strongly reccomend to anybody who enjoys hearthstone as its a step up. Game needs more advertisement though I think it has potential to be the best of its kind. Also message me if you enjoy this review and I can give you a reference code to play and it would help me out a ton :)			"

								In a nutshell:  Infinity Wars is a great game, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting a deep strategy card experience.**At first I was playing Infinity Wars and Hearthstone, and I was vacillating between the two.  Then I gave Infinity Wars a dedicated afternoon, and that's all she wrote.  Now it's Infinity Wars and nothing else.When you first start playing you don't realize how many subtle mechanics there are that really allow a deep level of strategy and custom deck building.  Once you do; however, you quickly come to appreciate how intricate and sophisticated this game can be (and I mean that in a very good way!).  There are also a TON of cards and card combinations, so anyone who enjoys building a unique, custom deck is going to be in hog heaven.When you do give this game a try don't be put off by the generic feeling tutorial and beginner campaign decks.  These are simple on purpose I believe to ease beginners into the game.  Once you have the basics under your belt try searching the web for some custom deck ideas.  You'll quickly see the amazing amount of different ways you can put together a devious combination of cards to wreck havoc on your opponent.And did I mention the daily log in rewards, quests, tournaments, ranked play, leveling rewards, etc. etc.?  This game has a lot going for it to keep you engaged, and it's an indie title too boot.  You can't lose on that!So, in summary:  This is a fantastic game, and if you should definitely give it a shot.  I'll bet you'll be hooked in no time.  :)And feel free to hit me up for a game anytime.			"

												Infinity Wars is one of the greatest digital TCGs... scratch that.Infinity Wars is one of the greatest TCGs I have ever played, and I have played my fair share.This game is not for those who are only seeking a casual experience (seriously, go play Hearthstone or one of those web-based games), Infinity Wars has a great level of depth to the gameplay that can only be found in simultaneous turns. Imagine fusing competitive pokemon with its simultaneous turns (leading to prediction wars, 50/50s, and a very intense experience) with MTG (factions with very different tools that work together to create hundreds of possible strategies).Ok, so currently its not the most balanced game ever. The exiles faction is bothering many players with its RNG elements. HOWEVER this is not as serious a problem as many take it to be. This is not like Magic where any deck that isn't OP will never win. You can get by with a limited card pool without dropping $100 plus. This game is completely free to play. I haven't dropped a cent on this yet, although I do plan on doing so at some point to help out the developers.Speaking of limited card pools, those without a lot of Rare/Legendary/Epic cards can play ""paupers"" where only common and uncommon are allowed, or merged, where the two players divide their decks amongst each other. These have really long queues, however.There are a lot more features coming soon too, and IW2015 will be expanding on the already existing game. Team battles and other stuff are in the works, or so I hear.TL;DR Jus' get it. It gud an' free tu.			"

												At the time of this review i have logged 41 hours on this game. Infifnity Wars is an amazing tcg with new inivative mechanics combined with astounding animated are for each card. the turns are taken simaltainiously with both players having the same amount of rescources at the stard of the match, this game features a double win condidtion style of players which alters which faction and type of deck you play. This is what seperates this game from other tcgs.                     however it has 1 shortcoming- you need to spend a lot of time with this game to get anywhere in a pvp ranked envornment  (Without spending Money) this is because of the in-game Currency nothing really wrong with it except the average game win gives you 150-170 IP (Infinity Points) which would not be a problem if it were not for the OUTRAGOUS cost of a free to play pack at a whopping 5,400 IP which would mean i would need to win around 40 pvp matches to get even one. leveling gives you packs but with increasing amount of XP you need they are few and far apart. the paid price is reasonable at a $2.50 ratio and when you perchase the paid currency it gives you some IP as well depending on how much money you spend.                                     you could do an endless grind to get packs but the game feels like its pushing you to become a paid user and if you dont you fall behind because new sets are released at an average rate and cards that you own may become useless. also the cards you earn with Leveling up cannot be traded. trading in this game is hard to do because of the tier list that are mademany poeple ive traded with use different tier lists so card value feels non-existant at best. (this of corse depends on who you trade with.) Its fun to play and i'd recommend it for any TCG player 8/10			"

Posted: August 12, 2015
												So I have a little bit of a hard time deciding whether or not to recommend this game. On the one hand it has excellent game mechanics and in terms of strategic depth it's probably the best card game I've seen (including magic the gathering - also if you liked magic you will almost certainly love this game!).That said the game doesn't have the largest player base anymore (only a few hundred people at a time now a days) and there are some noteworthy issues with it.Rating of IW:Mechanics: 9.5/10 (and I don't think I'd give anything a 10)Strategic Depth: 9.5/10Balance: 6 (it's not horrible and the margin by which it tends to favor certain builds isn't actually that big. But the meta has felt pretty similar for a long time).Welcoming to new players: Game 1/10; Community 7-8/10. This game takes a lot of time to really get into. It's a great game but expect to put many hours into it to get a feel for the mechanics, tricks, meta, etc. (To give a rough idea I'd say you need to spend about 20hours on this game just to get a decent feel of it).Developer Responsiveness: 6/10Bugs: 5/10 (They aren't horrible, you can still play the game and most often don't run into them, but do expect to lose matches occasionally (around 1 in 50?) due to bugs that aren't going away anytime soon).F2P: 9.5/10So with regards to the mechanics/strategy. This game uses simultaneous turns and resources automatically increase up to 10. The resources thing is nice (particularly if you are coming from magic, no getting land sc***ed or mana glut) but it's really the simultaneous turns that make this game stand out. Both players que there turns at the same time, on a given turn one player has priority and priority switches player each turn. The order of play is as follows: upkeep and comes into play effects, premeptive abilities, regular abilities, attacking and the other player defending (each of those resolves for the player with priority and then the other player and each player gets to que the order in which their cards happen within those phases) - although it's a lot more streamline when playing it than what I just described sounds.  Since both players turns are qued at the same time and resolve without either player being able to react to them this introduces a lot of bluffing into the game. For example ""Which zone is this character going to be in? One were they can attack or defend or back in support where they are safer from my opponents removal cards?"" A lot of the game has to do with correctly and consistently anticipating your opponents actions and winning a game has as much to do with deck construction as it does with accurately predicting your opponent (depending on the match the second one of these can be more important.. especially in draft formats).Cards: Cards are quite diverse and comprable to magic the gather in terms of the range of their mechanics. (Noting that magic has something like 20 years on this game, so more like magic back in the mercadian masques block).Welcoming to new players: The community is pretty friendly and will generally be pretty nice to players (well, maybe not if a player is complaining to them about something that they aren't really the person it should be taken up with, but in general). That said the campaign and challenges (a.k.a. tutorial/single player) is pretty short and it takes a very long time to build up ones card pool. So starting out you will probably lose a lot. Try rift runs because at least then the card pool is statistically the same for you and your opponent, but you won't have the experience with the game that they do and still don't expect to win that much for awhile. Harsh I know, and lots of players (both new and old) have given feedback on how to improve that aspect but,Developer Responsiveness: This is a game by a small indie company. They have a community manager and player support person (a different person for each of those). Both of those people are pretty on top of it and I do feel like the developers work pretty hard on the game behind the scenes. Also generally they do actually look at player feedback and address it... eventually. I've made several different suggestions (on rewording particular cards, new card ideas and various other things) as I've played the game and I've usually seen something addressing what I've mentioned (text being fixed to make it more clear, cards to fit slots that certain factions were lacking, etc). That said don't expect a quick response to anything that requires input on the devs side of things. My general feeling is that between coming up with new cards and fixing stuff that their small dev team is a bit overwhelmed and while they will get to stuff eventually it might take a few months - really pressing stuff is faster, but don't be surprised if this thing you feel like is really pressing isn't pressing enough to get addressed quickly.Bugs: The game is peer to peer, meaning that desyncs will happen and when they happen lots of things will get screwed up and sometimes the match will just freeze (in game this is refered to as the endless turn bug/glitch). Most often this doesn't happen, but expect it to happen about 1/50 matches on average and when it does happen expect it to either cost you or your opponent the game. This might eventually get fixed, but from the communty managers responses/how long people have been complaining about it, I wouldn't expect it to happen anytime soon (maybe in a couple of years?).That aside the game isn't that buggy, usually there are a few issues after a patch but they tend to get resolved within a few weeks and aren't too major (things doing a little bit different things than what the cards say, UI scrolling being a little off, etc).F2P (free to play): You get IP (in game currency for playing dependent upon how long you play (ip gain for a match caps at 5minutes into the match)) and eventhing in the game can be bought using IP. Also IP works out to being something like $3-4/hour in terms of spending real money on packs. Which is a pretty good rate considering that your getting that for just playing the game. That said, when starting out you will run into people who seem to have all the cards and be able to do these decks that you don't feel like you'll ever have the cards for. In general those people have been playing for a long time. It requires a lot of time and/or money in order to get a good card pool and whether or not the person has been spending money or not if they have a good card pool they have probably played for quite some time (notice my almost 1300hours on the game and I didn't start until this game was advertized on steam). The game does favor more experienced players, honestly less in the card pool issue (since there is a built in draft format that is a lot of fun and honestly better than ranked play, at least in my opininon), more in the fact that it's a deep strategy game and it takes time to learn how to play and then a lot more time to learn how to play well.Overall it's a great game, with some notable drawbacks, but I'd still strongly encourage checking it out if you have time. It's more one of those games to play for awhile, get a good feel for and then come back to it now and then (I strongly encourage long breaks from it when you get bored with it).			"

												Pretty great little free to play game.  The campaign mode is fairly extensive, and gives you a pretty nice little starter deck for each faction by the time you finish it.  The rift mode (think hearthstone arena) is a very fun limited style that lets you compete in PVP without having to own all the cards.  The UI is easy to use.  As for the actual gameplay, I certainly enjoy it.  Haven't really gotten deep enough to know if it's 100% balanced, but it's close enough to be a lot of fun			"

												Just terrible balance, to hard to enjoy the game when there's just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cards out there. I really enjoy the idea of the game with the strategy of anticipating what your opponent will do and countering it, but theres to many cards that flat out need no strategy to play/use and the only way to counter is to hope you have some bs cards as well. Really defeats the purpose of playing with any thought, so i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone unfortunetly.			"

								It's a very unique TCG. Gameplay is very fun and has great graphics(If it matters to you). The gameplay itself is unique with the simultanious turns aspect of the game. It's kinda hard to get booster packs because they're kinda expensive for ingame money which you have to farm but it's very easy to get free cards(Which are locked, meaning it can't be tradded but that's the only downside to locked cards) for every clan, For Example: if you play the campaign(There is one for every Faction) You can get a starter deck of that particular faction.The tutorial is very good unlike some other games, it actually teaches you how to get advantage with the unique aspect of the game.I had a good experience with this game, a very fun one, I met some really friendly players unlike the usual butthurt people you'd meet in other games, the community, even though is small, is a great community. Overall I think this game is great and more people should play it.			"

												TL:DR Solid Card Game. Gameplay/mechanics are ok but somewhat overpowerd all over the place. Games can be really short cause a 40 card deck is used > faster pulls > faster good cards > faster game. The Cardart is average at best and the ""animated"" part most of the times is a joke... a really lame one. Please take my low gametime into account on this review.So the Gameplay and Coremechanics of this game pretty much allow for the same things you would except of a cardgame. Control, aggro, ramp, graveyardaction, you want a certain heartstone/magic/yugioh deckstyle? you can build it. At first glance i really really liked this but i wondered why the games always turned out to be very short. Well only 40 cards in your deck so if your used to drafting and get your core combo going fast the game will end fast. Doesnt mean its easy to win. It's not cause its a lot more ""poker""-type to play cause the turns are resolved simultanously. you might be casting destructionspells on the enemy killercard... and he just pulls it back to base the same turn. he saves his card, you get nothing for yours. Nice! The reasons i wont be continueing playing and recommending this to any of my friends are simple. The cardart looks like the lower average user of deviantart has created it. I didnt see any card where i just zoomed in on it and was yawdropped by the art. Then there is the ""animated cardgame"" thing... the battlefield is a bad 3d type and the animation mostly consists of slight breathing movements or fast resovled 3 or 4 single frames. lame and also not of the epic looking kind. Also bad seems to be the way of card requisition. over the 4 hours gametime i had i managed to buy 3, yes three! cards with the influence points i got. yes i got boosters through quests but those where the starter quests. so there is no longterm benifit for this game. you just wont get cards in a good manner of time spent/card.not recommendedDont think this review was helpful? Leave a comment! I'm happy to give you any information you want :) .Dislike this review cause you disagree? Well cant help with that, its my personal opinion. Feel free to leave a comment to corrrect me, maybe you are the one getting me back into this game :) .			"

								i love this game!  I have been playing CCGs since Magic the gathering 4th edition came out.  Most recently I played a big name digital card by Blizzard, which i was very disappointed with.  Infinity Wars is the whole package.  Fun gameplay, fantastic card animations, and a HUGE library of cards.Now some specifics:1) there is a fantastic campaign mode that quickly gets you starter sets for every faction in the game, enabling you to quickly begin trying all the factions out to see what kind of decks you might like.2) I felt like I was always unlocking new cards.  after only playing for 4 days I have over 600 cards.3) There is never any need to spend real money on this game.  you can unlock every card just by playing the game.4) You get a random card just for logging in every day.  that card can be any card and rarity.  from common to legendary.5) Theres a reward for playing 3 games in a day, and weekly quests as well.6) You get rewarded for playing against your friends.  More xp, more in game currency, and more cards.7) This is the first digital CCG I have played that actually feels good to play on the computer.  In fact the game itself would not work as a tabletop game. Thats because...8)  Each player plays cards at the same time!  Let me explain.  each turn you have about 2 minutes to spend your resources to summon you characters, use special abilities, attack your foe and defend yourself.  Once you have done everything you want for the turn you simply push the ""end turn"" button. While you have been doing everything listed above so has your opponent, so when you both push ""end turn"" the uniqueness of simultanious play really shines.  every happens in a specific order for both characters at the same time, allowing for bluffing, tricking, trapping and utterly destorying your foe in fun new ways not possible in traditional card games.Now for some of not so good things about infinity wars:1) this is most definatly still a beta version of the game.  it crashes, it gltches, cards will be covered by other text, some cards abilities act a little wonky.  the game still has some bugs for sure, but even with its technical issues it is still worth playing.2) the card library needs some work.  when you go in to find a card there are some helpful search options to find what your looking for, but there needs to be more.  there needs to be an option to look up cards by special ability and by resource cost.  you can llok up cards by faction, by type of card, and by which set of cards its from; but with the amount of cards in the game there needs to be a better way to narrow it down.3) This game needs more players!  I dont know how many people are currently playing, but there have been a few times when Ive tried to play some PVP matches and it took 3-5 minutes to find someone to play against.4) It seems to take lots of in game currency to buy anything.  it costs 5200 points to buy a boster of cards that comes with 15 cards.  you get at most 75 points after playing a bot, or 150 for beating a pvp match.  if its your friend you both get 150 win or lose.  you need to play 70 bots minimum to get a booster or 35 pvp matches.  In my opinion you should be able to get a booster in half that many games.so there you have it.  dispite some flaws that will hopefully be worked out as the game nears official release this is still the digital CCG to play.  Fast, fun, and unique in a way no other card game has every been.  Hope to see you on Infinity Wars!			"

								A good alternative to Hearthstone and MTG that features stunning card animations and very unique gameplay.Infinity Wars is an easy to learn but complex card game that focuses on winning in either two ways, destroy the enemy fortress (which has health) or kill enough of their minions and deplete enemy morale to zero, forcing their retreat. You choose 3 commanders, of whatever faction you wish, but depending on which cards you want to use, you will need a minimum amount of that factions commanders. An example would be having a specific faction card, lets say (Genesis) that requires you to have 2 of its factions commanders. For this card to be in your deck, you need 2 of those 3 required commanders to be of that faction, in this case Genesis. This allows for unique deck creation as you can have 1 commander from 3 different factions, allowing you to use faction cards with a required commander cost of 1, making it a unique and versatile deck. Or if your like me, use three commanders from the same faction and gain access to its extremely powerful cards.Very noob friendly with a long and informative tutorial that is completely optional to do, but I would highly recommend completing the first two sections to make sure you understand the game. The third is for more advanced play, and can take upwards of an hour to complete, due to learning how to use special game mechanics.To make sure you aren't getting destroyed, multiplayer VS people is disabled until you reach level 4, which will take roughly 1:30 - 2:00 hours to finish.There is a long campaign that is interesting and very fun, which allows you to play every faction in the game to better learn its playstyle and get comfortable with the cards they command. Or if you feel like killing computers for that much wanted experience, just play the AI over and over until you reach the required level.No Pay 2 Win, you can pay for decks and booster packs with real money or use the in game currency to buy cards. (like most online TGC) If you do choose to sink money into IW, the prices are very reasonable and you get a good amount of cards added to your collection.Low player base, as its probably not very popular with the current kings of cards being MTG and more recently, Hearthstone.If you were to ask me to explain Infinity Wars in a sentence, it would be (Its like the middle grounds of Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering: animated cards, complex at times, simple to learn and very fun to play)Personal Rating: 4/5			"

								It's a trading card game that is beautiful and you'll need to bring some strategics to the board.I've played this game and Heartstone. I prefer IW to heartstone. because this seems to have a bit more depth.I find the diversity in IW a big pro. Also not necessary to buy any cards - because you get quite some free booster packs by achieving stuff (single player campaign, pvp games, by logging in every day and/ or playing three matches).There are a lot of different gameplays (merged for example merges both players decks, rifting which will build a deck befoe you start - and with that one you need to keep winning as much as possible, before losing 3 times).I did purchase some booster packs to help the development - and to enhance my chance on a few cool cards. But really it's completely playable (the campaign) without any purchases - just finished the campaign.Apart from the regular cards, there are also star trek:tng cards - you do need to purchase that if you want. But apart from adding ST:TNG to your deck it's just cards, that you don't really need  of course.The selection of cards to build a deck could be better, but since the game is only in beta - i imagine that this will improve in the next period.All in all - if you like trading card games, i highly recommend this. My referralcode is F9DD5. But the referral system is not yet active - because it's still beta.The game itself is stable, fun, intelligent and... well fun.			"

												I came in to this very skeptical because honestly most free to play card games are garbage. This is not. At a time when f2p companies shill out insults like ""dungeon keeper"" and refer to gamers as ""whales"" to be harvested for money, Infinity Wars stands out as a small glimmer of hope. You can unlock everything you need to get started by playing the campaign, they give you a free card daily, they let you earn IP points toward deck and booster purchases that you earn just by playing, and they even give you a handful of free to play decks that are rotated weekly just in case you are too lazy to build your own.     The game mechanics are solid but are a bit hard to explain, there are other reviews that have covered them in depth so I'm just going to say the way the game plays is unique, functional, challenging , and fun. The campaigns are easy to blow through and give a reasonable back story for the game world. The multiplayer community as far as I have seen have been friendly and are generally good sports.    Just try it, it isn't like you will lose anything by doing so, and I have a feeling you will be very pleasantly surprised if you give this game a chance.     Edit Since my initial review they have massively dumbed down the campaign so that aspect is now unfun and provides no backstory.			"

												Hey, it´s free, it doesn´t rub your nose into a puddle of ""PAY MONEY HERE"" mud and its quite some fun to play. If you compare it to MTG, it has some serious flaws, but nothing that would spoil the entire experience.The design is ok, with some nice card artworks - but the animations are nothing that would save an entirely bad TCG at all. The gameplay is interesting enough to keep you entertained, dividing the battlefield into attacking forces and defending forces gives some nice twists compared to MTG.What I really like about the game is the cast single player campaign against AI. It brings back memories from the good old days when majestic chess tought you the game of the games by telling a nice story of a lost kingdom, guiding you from one chess experience to the next.The campaign in Infinity Wars does a similar job.Give it a try!

												Hey.Heres my thoughts of Infinity wars TCCG.I played some (some will say a lot) of MTG , but last time i played is a few years ago. That way i know what to expect from a Card game like this. Was I dissapointet? NO. This game really bring some new and exiting aspects to the genre.Many game mechanics is well known, and some even has familiar names (like haste etc..). The new mechanics are an awesome addition to the genres as well. Gameplay:The first thing you notice is the 3 Commanders sitting on the battlefield right from turn 1 , ready to use their abilities! Technically they're not actually on the battlefield, as the term battliefield is used for specific areas of the entire playing field. This is not a rule book though, so I wont go into further details here. The commanders will decide wich ""mana colors"" (MTG term), or ""Faction"" as we call them you can play. By determining the 3 commanders you choose weather you go for 3 different factions, or maybe just a single faction. ""Purity"" then determines how ""powerfull"" spell or characters you can have within that faction. The most powerfull will require 3 commanders of the same color.One of the first thing that I noticed was the very fluid gameplay. You have something to play and do every single turn. The way resources are handled are so much better compared to MTG, at least in my opinnion. You start each game with 1 ressource, and you gain 1 each turn. By turn 10 both players should have 10 resources (resources are like mana). There are ways however to speed up the process of getting much mana faster though just like we know from other games. There are ALSO ways to Loose a step in the race for mana. Cards like asassinate will let you asassinate ANY character on the board. But the Price is that you Loose 1 ressource point. You will still reach 10, but it will now take 1 turn more than you're opponent, There are also ways to gain more than 10 total. The way this Works results in a fluid gameplay. Everyone that plays MTG know that even the best deck can have a really bad Draw and either Draw no land, or just land land land. Both ways will destroy most decks in MTG. You will never run short of mana in IW, or get a bad Draw (at least mana wise). If you construct your deck wisely, you can rely on the deck to Work close to perfect everytime. In other words, you know that you have excatly 6 mana (at least) on turn 6 etc...The playfield is divided into zones. This is a huge improvement!!! There is so much more ""mind game"" going on inside the game, since you can move most Cards from one zone to another, and even from the actual ""battlefield"" and back to a support zone. Even the most powerfull Cards from your opponent can be countered by simply anticipating what he will do, and move cards out of the battlefield when you expect him to. Awesome when it Works. On the other hand can you move your own stuff away from the battlefield to ""bluff"" that a mass destruction spell or similar are Brewing, and then ending up with a non defended ""defense"" zone at your opponent... Great new aspect to the Whole TCG genre :)Is it pay to win? - Both yes and no- You can play ALOT without paying a dime! - playing through the campain will earn you a lot of free Cards and plenty of the ingame points to start playing draft, or rift run as its called in IW.- Rift run is fairly cheap, 1000 in game points, for each run. A run can be several games, at least 3, but if you reach 5 or 6 games you already earned enough points to go Again.- If you wanna play constructed you might want to Invest in som Cards, but you really dont have to.The first time i tried ""constructed"" mode with the basic free Cards i earned through the campain i REALLY got crushed. Mostly by very powerfull decks with Cards that i never seen before. (read: the first 10 games i lost!!)I'm not sure how the match up system Works? - i find no documentation on that anywhere?It would be nice to have several ""classes"" so that newbees only match up against similar players with similar strenght.That should apply to both ""normal"" and ""ranked"" play. It will be easier for newcomers, and probably also more competitive for the seasoned players. For him Theres no fun in beating a newbee in 5 turns game after game.Multiplayer vs. AIThe AI in the game is very week, and provides no match up at all. As soon as you have played just a few hours the AI dummies will be so easy to beat that you cant really test out new deck ideas etc. in that way. You have to go multiplayer.And of course this game wouldn't be anything with out multiplayer. And funny enough this is both the games strongest point and also the weekest point. The strong point is that the Whole mechanism of doing actions simultaneously and than have to see what happens when your battle orders is carried out is very well suited for multiplayer on-line game. In fact I dont see this concept being ported to ""real life"" Card games, and the feature would be very uniqe to a digital version of gaming. The week thing though is that there are WAY too many bugs, disconnecting from servers, waiting in infinty for opponents etc... I have lost quite many rift runs due to disconnecting! which really is SO annoying, and by no Means acceptable. It shouldn't be rocket science to make a multiplayer game in 2014 , come on really?I usually sit Down, knowing I have a few hours to play maybe 8,10,12 games one evening. I play 5 games, 3 of them ended in either a win because the opponent disconnect, or I disconnect and Loose... Sure I will quit the game and go use my time on something better. Over time I will not Invest in any Cards, and then I will Loose interest in the game overall. Yes, there have been days where I can play 9 out of 10 games with no disconnection, but I havent yet had 10 out of 10 without problems.These issues have to be fixed.If you asked my if i wanted lightmare to focus on better servers or more great Card expansions, i would definetly say FIX the server issues right now!I know the base game is free, but will there be players left if it doesnt Work,.

												It is probably the best TCG at the moment, I find it better than Magic - The gathering, Hearhhstone and any other card games that is currently out there. The card art are beautifully made, everything is animated. You can tell a lot of effort is placed into creating them. The gameplay is pretty in depth, the developers are always updating people on their progression and the community. It's a game worth a shot. It's not a mindless game where you play random cards to win, you actually need to think. So for anyone that enjoys game that requires you to think and plan, give Infinity Wars a try - you wont regret it. Have I mentioned that it's one of the least pay to win sort of game?			"

								I've been impressed with this game so far. Neat combat mechanics but with enjoyably complex card text in places. The animated cards are the best I have seen in this type of game; they are gorgeous, atmospheric and fun pieces that do a lot to bring the player into the world, and they justify the time spent building decks. Probably worth the (complete lack of) admission fee alone.More people should be playing this. If you like Hearthstone but want some meatier deck building and card interactions, or just a Magic alternative, I recommend it.			"

												""888 hours of on-off again love making."" Infinity Wars is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic culmination of the perfect TCG for strategic like minds. Lightmare achieved great success in creating an innovative and pleasurable card game from its competitors; (Hearthstone, Hex, Duelyst, Labyrinth, Spellweaver etc.) The only dysfunction was in the management and disappearance of any sort development or communication to its players. That really hurt the already dwindling player base and left much of the community angry. We felt quite disrespected and discouraged. However, in the past months bugs have gotten squashed and patches are cleaning off the dirt they let collect. They're redeeming themselves and I have hope that the process will not stop.

												I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and still do whenever I play it. This game has been plagued by bugs from the start and a few tend to pop-up every now and then after a new patch, but it's pretty much bug free at the moment. The game has such a unique playstyle with a battleground consisting of four zones to put your cards in. Besides having to worry about your fortress' health, you also have to take the morale of your troops into account - losing too many valued troops will ensure defeat as much a the destruction of your fortress. Combined with the synchronised turn system this creates a tactical element and a mind-game that is unseen in other card games! The different factions have a truly unique playstyle and some of the animated cards are something to marvel at. The learning curve is rather steep but this just kept me coming back to the game to learn more about it and improve my playstyle and deckbuilding knowledge. Give this game a try: play the campaign and some player matches with the free-to-play weekly decks and I'm sure you will be captivated by the experience. "

I realy like the fact they put inside a trading system where ppls can exchange cards. But i think its hurt their income ( ppls simply trade with others to get the lowed cards. And thats why they will not buy it from real money) In short : Help the comunity and let make that game popular!			"

												Overall:  +ves    Variety, Replayability, Many cards, Customization-ves    Occasional glitches and longer online loading times, Somewhat slow response time onlineInfinity Wars is an excellent card game. Those who like games like Magic and Hearthstone will likely enjoy this free game noting similarities in gameplay. There are 8 factions cards can be a part of but you generally have 1-3 of these types in your deck so the game doesn't try to limit you to specific cards from only one faction. Each faction has a certain advantage and style to the way the cards are. Personally my favourites are the Sleepers of Avarrach (zombies), Warpath (powerful beasts), Exiles (unpredictable demons) and Cult of Verore (Spell focused).Cards can have specific advantages like Charge, Flying, Reach, and special abilities which make the game interesting. Like most games of this manner, the goal is to reduce the opponent's health to zero by attacking their fortress directly, but you can also win by reducing the opponent's morale by killing many of his/her cards. This adds a variety of ways to play and no game is ever really the same.There is a shorter to medium length campaign that is relatively interesting. They did only have it for 4 of the factions but added 2 more which leads me to assume they will make 2 more for the remaining factions. New players can get cards through the campaign and you can get more cards by a) signing in dailyb) leveling upc) buying them in the shop using in-game currency or real moneyThere are tons of cards to collect so don't worry about collecting them all and having nothing left to do.After campaign there isn't too much to do besides online battles. However, there is a decent online community and finding a match for me has ranged from 20 seconds to 4 minutes. There is some options online however I have only done constructed battles. It is completely random I believe because I have ended up playing against people way better than me with very rare cards and also against people not that good. Expect anyone playing online to have completed campaign and to be somewhat skilled. The cool thing about online is that you can use any deck you want (as long as it is legal) so there is unlimited replayability.For someone who isn't very good at the strategy and just enjoys collecting cards, making a deck, and trying to win with it, this game is very fun and although not always forgiving, not overly hard to get a win here and there to keep it fun.

												pors : - game got a new twist with moral and health and card concepts .( wish there is more )- its amusing at the start you can keep going on the campain with out noticing the time .- Free to try before taken any decision on investing . Cos : - PVP matchs takes to long  to start and queues are 1 year long , population is low (but hay maybe because its on lanche still i dont know )- Cards and factions need some balaning- there should be a Vip system for players who invest in this game with bonus ip/exp or some thing , there is a ton of games that does it proper with out breaking the game .-needs more events and special weekly offers or some thing i literally feel dull in this game , it needs to offer more and shines some bling blings why so stingy .- packs have low drop rate on the good stuff which is frustrating .. and makes investing a big risk and you end up with a ton of useless cards you dont need and you cant trade it for some thing els.Overall : the game is not bad but needs more time and more people to play it to be decent , iwill revist it and edit the view later hopefuly.

The other thing I like it about it is that compared to other card games it's not a super huge grind to get all the cards you want.. the game is not purely pay to win you can earn packs by playing, completing daily missions(for the currency to buy packs), and by logging several days in a row.Aside from that, it's got everything you'd expect from a tcg combos and synergy and some very fun decks to build and collect.

Lightmare achieved great success in creating an innovative and pleasurable card game from its competitors; (Hearthstone, Hex, Duelyst, Labyrinth, Spellweaver etc.) The only dysfunction was in the management and disappearance of any sort development or communication to its players. That really hurt the already dwindling player base and left much of the community angry. We felt quite disrespected and discouraged. However, in the past months bugs have gotten squashed and patches are cleaning off the dirt they let collect. They're redeeming themselves and I have hope that the process will not stop.

												Really been loving this game. Its NOT pay to win. You can unlock most of your cards by playing campaign and training missions. It also provides a fresh take on the genre.Take a look at this gameplay video:

												Its a great game. She just need some love and hype :) For me its much better than hearthstone or other card games. The cards are well designed and the musics are awesome. I realy like the fact they put inside a trading system where ppls can exchange cards. But i think its hurt their income ( ppls simply trade with others to get the lowed cards. And thats why they will not buy it from real money) In short : Help the comunity and let make that game popular!			"

								The game is fun and addictive if you are into TCG's like MTG or Hearthstone. Its edge lies in almost endless possibilities of combos reserved on your choice of cards in your deck.Cons: -Matchmaking is pretty much who's currently online in the game, since you don't know how many players are in there. -You end up battling the same player over and over again for about 3-15mins while looking for a normal game or ranked.-most game modes are there for show-Prices of decks and booster packs by IP are discouraging to play more.-Cosmetics are only purchaseable by LP. Only chance to get cosmetics is through pre-order-A lot of imbalances and glitches (common since it is still in beta)-Too many cheesers who will end the game in about 8turns as if they are cheatingPros:-Solid community, since the devs and mods are practically online everyday to chat. Hence, they can improve the game through direct feedback and players will get their news faster and gain a heads up on what's being added/fixed in the game.-Wide range of strategy to choose from be it defensive or offensive type of battle as their is a Morale mechanic to the game.-Great and humorous artwork. Its animation makes it an eye-catcher to new players and veteran players alike as if you want to collect them all.-There's a rift run mode practically the same with Hearthstone; but it gives you an opputunity to buy the deck (hence getting the cards you need or that might come in handy)Overall, I recommend this game. If I were to rate it, I guess it's an ok game of 7/10.			"

												TL,DR:Pros:    + Free to play (definitely not pay to win, you can get all the cards without spending anything),    + You get plenty of free cards to start with,    + Great training and campaign,    + More complex and interesting that Hearthstone, but less complicated than MTG,    + Great game balance and plenty of unique factions/play styles,    + Easy learning curve if you are comming from another TCG    + Helpful and friendly community in chat,    + Active Devs! They can even be found in chat,    + Simultanious turns means little idle time while in a match,    + It never feels grindy, and if you decide to pay with real money the prices are quite reasonableCons:    - Limited playerbase, I have no idea why,    - Game is not without its (minor) bugs,    - While you do get a lot of cards to start with, they are mostly commons and uncommons, you will need to spend a lot of time trying to get rarer cards and cards that you need,    - Card base is nowhere near as large as MTG, but to be expected from a relatively new game.Long, did Read:Great for a free to play game. Playing thru the campaign gets you around 600 cards (easily enough to make a decent deck) and enough IP (in game credit) to buy another booster pack. It never feels grindy and it is fun regardless of what cards you own.After you have completed the training and campaign there is a solid match making system in place for when you want a challenge. On top of that, if you feel that you can't make a competitive deck with your own cards there are weekly free decks to borrow. While the game is definetely a true free to play (you can get all the cards without paying a cent), you will notice the strength of decks of more seasoned players. The main issue isn't the game itself, but the fact that few people have heard about it. Having said that, the AI is puts up decent fight and if you are prepared to wait a lil while to find a match, you are in for a treat!  Alternately invite a friend (it's free) so you don't have to wait to find a match!Edit: Spelling			"

												A TCG that is hardly pay to win? Yeah, I can win about half the casual games I play and I have only spent money in the game recently.(just to support it, not because I needed anything.) The game gives you a lot of average pre-made decks to start off with and a lot of good cards, including some rare ones, just by playing the campain.(not tradable) Sure if you want to spend $100 in this game you could, but even $5 is enough to get you a good 43 card deck. The gameplay is fairly good and has hundreds of good stratigies to try. The game is still getting updates and being reworked to be more friendly to new players. There are a few things that are not very good about the game. The bugs, the way you can face up againt players much better than you that you never have a chance to win against.(it faced me up against the best IW player in the world, Adorabear once) and the voice acting in the campaign. With those downsides in mind, this is being made by a relitivly small team so the downsides get a pass by me. Over all, it has it's quirks but is worth a try to anyone who even might see this as slightly entertaining. It is free after all.			"

												tl;dr: I like it a lot.I've never really been able to get into the CCG/TCG scene due to the fact that I'm always poor. Recently I started playing Hearthstone which I love but it doesn't have TONS of depth or strategy. Then, I remembered reading about Infinity Wars so I hopped on Steam to check it out. I love it! With the multiple zones, multiple factions and being able to win by dropping either the health or morale of your opponent, the amount of strategy in this game is ridiculous! Though, the amount of options does add a bit of a learning curve, the tutorials and Campaign are a great way to learn the game before jumping into PvP. Added to the fact that you get a decent amount of cards from the campaign and leveling up you don't actually have to drop any money to enjoy it! I might end up spending some real money down the road but as of now I don't think this is as Pay 2 Win as other F2P CCG's. Add the fact that you can trade (unsoulbound) cards with your friends and you have the formula for an awesome as hell Free 2 Play TCG! Download. Play. Enjoy!			"

												This game is an unpolished buggy mess.  Mousing over a keyword ability is supposed to explain what the ability actually is, but in almost all cases it just gives you the card's text in another text box.  I've mulliganed and have been unable to drag the only one cost card I have into the play area.  I've leveled up only to not receive any of the rewards I was promised for doing so.  And worst of all are the desyncs that make the game totally unplayable.  On the gameplay side, the non-standard modes appear to be totally barren, those modes being the only ones (other than draft) that eliminate the pay/grind-to-win aspects inherent in any tcg/ccg.  And the draft mode is just a gambling game where you pray to RNGesus to please give you good cards to chose from.  All that being said, it's free to play so I guess there's no good reason for people reading this not to try it.			"

								Edit: Went back to the game end of 2016 after long break. It is more balanced and polished than ever before. While the playerbase is unfortutanely quite small, Infinity wars is still the best online card game out there. There may be games that have more cards, and features and gimmicks, but they often become very linear an predictable. IW with its unique simultaneous turn based mechanic is still ahead of its time. You can't just make the perfect move as you would in a chess game or other trading card games, you always have to outsmart your enemy and be unpredictable, which makes this game very unique.Old 2014 review:Most addictive game I've played since.... I cant remember!  Get it now!  In my opinion its definitely not pay for win. You get enough cards create nice decks, or you can play shuffled mode where it doesnt matter who has better cards. Personally, I spent some money to support these creative developers, and because I love the Star Trek cards :DBut be warned, you may not get any sleep anymore...			"

								It's above average, but It just falls into the wave of generic CCGs that are coming out. It's no worse than Solforge or Hearthstone.

For a card game only in Beta, it is clearly superior to other computer-based MMOs.If you like collectible card games, try it, if not, pass.			"

												I have not played a better digital trading card game, and I have tried quite a few. Infinity Wars seeks to be truly unique by taking full advantage of the digital space, doing things a normal card game cannot easily do. We see basic things like animated cards and persistant health amounts, but we also see the major gameplay element of simultaneous turns, where both players plan out their turns, then once both players hit End, they resolve at the same time. This creates a game where you have to consider what your opponent might be about to do and predict their plans.As said, I have never had more fun playing a card game, and I suggest giving it a look.

The simultanious turn system is absolutely invigorating and forms a whole new way of thinking about which cards to play. The game has a tutorial system for playing and learning the functions that will tell you what the phase or type of card is and then put you in a partial game to use the new fuction or type of card and allow you to learn without shoving information down your throat.The free cards for the day can be both REALLY awesome or a common, but it is one of the few games that stay true to the ""consistant login yields better rewards."" Somedays I will literally login and play three games to get both free cards, others i'll get on and just play and get them along the way. While the levels themselves seem to have no purpose, every time you level up you are rewarded with a free booster pack (untradeable cards however.) In-game currency can be used to buy booster packs that do contain tradeable cards. Potentially my favorite thing with this game is it's ability to hold true to ""No One Deck Wins"" (similar to MTG)			"

								Awesome card game. I love how it isn't even possibly to play physically due to synchronous turns (as well as the added tactics that that brings) - really makes the game stand out!It's also got fully animated cards that look amazing. Personally I'm a huge fan of drafting, getting to play with a large variety of cards is really interesting. I've got a few videos of it up here: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSabre070It's got ranked constructed play, if you're into that. It's not super hard to get a competitive deck going and you don't need to pay money (though it can help to have some variety) and can earn cards with in-game currency. Great gameplay, great art, great community - what more do you need?			"

												I just spent three hours learning the basics of this game, going through the first campaign, and trying to build my first deck. I thoroughly enjoyed it.It is a very fun way to play a TCG with the ""simultaneous turns."" You have to really think about what the other player may or may not do before you strike out to fulfill your destiny.There appears to be a reasonably priced system to buy new decks, avatars, skins, etc. There are also points that you win in-game that you can use to buy some of those things as well.Admittedly I struggled trying to build my own first deck the the cards I had unlocked, but I am sure I will figure it out soon enough. There are daily and weekly quests as additional incentive to play and... it is a tactic that will probably work on me.As I put more hours in--if anything changes--I'll come back and update my review.

												This game looks amazing and has great and inventive mechanics.I'd recommend it if I could actually play it, but currently the game is as broken as I've ever seen a game be, it's a flip of a coin on whether I'll be able to interact with menus, load into a game with my deck and hand, or even be able to get into the play menu. The game is unplayable without restarting ever few matches, and even when playing it's really clunky. Building a deck is a major pain that takes forever since you have to add cards some cards in an obtuse way to get them into the deck, and if you're unlucky your deck just won't save, or card sprites will stick to the window, or you won't be able to add/remove cards from your deck.The unranked play is an absolute joke. I played two games, went up against people that either grinded for hundreds of hours to buy the cards they had, or dropped few hundred dollars to make incredibly strong decks. I, on the other hand, had only the cards the game had given me for completing 19 campaign missions, and a deck that was legal and possibly decent if it didn't go up against decks that were stacked with Uniques, epics, and rares. The ranked play is locked behind level 10, which is a bit ridiculous and generally just turns me off of the game entirely.The campaigns are okay, but generally they just give you a deck and put you up against an AI, tell you very little, then assume that you can use whatever trick or gimmick of your deck to beat your opponnent's deck. It's unintuitive and generally a slog, though some missions are fun, most are very boring or luck based.The game could be amazing, it really could be; but at the moment it's a broken mess that I will not be revisiting anytime soon. This game is not fit for release, do not pay money into it until you've played at least a few hours and experienced the many bugs and glitches the game has to offer.			"

								Infinity wars is like any card game in real life. You gotta buy cards with real money. You kinda can't have a card game that's free and still have trading value and a economy. Well you probably can but let's just infinity wars does it decently enough. It's a card game that focuses around factions or ""Purity"" as it's called in game. unlike some card games, you don't take turns, you place down your cards and then hit ready and hope you played it right. This makes the game not so heavily RNG based and a bit more skill based. Unfourtunately it has it's cons. It uses in-game currency which is just a big no no in my book. It's also a big grind to get cards without paying. a REALLY big grind. You get a big sized deck everytime you level up (non tradable) but because the game is faction based you may only get a few cards you like or none at all. You can only have 3 of every card in your deck. This means once you get more then 3, the rest are worthless. There are ""infinite characters"" which you can have as many as you like till you reach the cap point of 100 cards per deck. Trust me, you'll get alot of dupes. It's still a great game and has a nice community. If you can get past the micro transaction part of it, it's a nice game. "

												A sold Mehh, the latest update came with a ton of bugs that pretty much broke the game for any new players. Fixes have been small and slow along with support, and any items that you may have missed out on you might as well forget. To put this into perspective losing 3 draft token items will cost you 30 hours of grinding or £1.42.  Doesn't sound like much but I would rather not pay either especially to a bug. They could do with tweaking the matching a bit as new players are currently paired up with high levels due to a small community (72 average steam players down from an average of 800+ two years ago). I could just ""get gud"" but the grind is slow, especially with the bugs and like I said it's mehh at best.A solid 3/10 in its current state as it's free2play.			"

												Got this game a few years back, and it seemed like a pretty cool game. The battle mechanics were pretty cool and the decks (and their card art) where really unique. However, the game was riddled with bugs, is still riddled with bugs, and many of those bugs actually interfere with your ability to play the game (freezing up, rounds not playing through, forcing you to leave a game you are in the middle of, random♥♥♥♥♥crashes, etc.).It's not like these bugs are a rare thing either, and for a long time I would look in the steam community and see a lot of people asking for these bugs to be addressed. Despite this, it seems like the devs were more interested in reworking the story mode (which was fine the way it was), making minor UI changes, and shoving out a grand total of ONE deck over the years.The game is also fairly dead now in comparison to when I started, often taking several minutes to find a match, which may crash or freeze as previously mentioned, and the people you get paired up with are either very new (which is not a problem if you're new to the game), or have put four times the amount of hours into this game that I have (which is a massive problem for new players) and no inbetween. The devs promised to fix that by advertising the game so more people would try it out, but I haven't seen any ads whatsoever, so the game is probably going to stay dead at this point.			"

								First of all, it cannot be overstated that beta is beta. There are missing sounds and animations, placeholder art, the interface needs reworking, and some things are just generally really rough around the edges. I'm going to assume that these things will be worked on and improved before the game is officially released. I have concerns about this, but more on that later.Infinity Wars is, in all aspects that are not likely to change during the beta, an excellent trading card game. The cards look great,  the gameplay mechanics are really innovative and fun, and there's plenty of modes for experienced players and free to play people alike.Speaking of free to play, Infinity Wars makes Hearthstone look like it's made by EA. I got a 15 card booster today just by logging in. The draft mode - directly copied from HS - has an entry fee of around 0,30€ (1,73€ in HS) if you convert the premium currency to real money, or 1000 IP, which you gain from playing. Going straight 0-3 gives you over a third of the IP back, and over five wins pays the whole thing back already. You also get free cards and boosters from simple daily quests, doing the campaign missions and leveling up, which is fairly rapid.While I'm going to recommend the game, I'd still suggest that you don't get into it just yet. My internal alarm bells are going off at the Infestation set preorder boosters. Why are they adding new cards when the already existing ones aren't finished yet? There are much more pressing issues than adding more content right now, and I can't be sure that the game gets to the level of polish I'm expecting it to.It's probably going to the best f2p card game on the PC regardless of how much or little it improves from this point, though.

												Try Infinity Wars. It's interactive, intellectual and packs some great innovations into a neatly designed TCG. - Simultaneous Turns- Inherent Anticipation & Deception- 3 Guaranteed Cards per Player- Inherent Hand Management MechanicsThe art and lore aren't to my taste, but this is still one of my favorite TCGs. The gameplay relies on your ability to anticipate your opponent and defy their expectations. It's strategic in the same vein as a high stakes game of poker. A lot of times when I play any of a dozen better known TCGs, it feels like my opponent and I are playing 2 independent games of solitaire. This game could not be further from that.			"

												A good TCG. Innovative game mechanics with simultanious turn resolution and other things that can work in a virtual TCG but not in a IRL one.  Simultanious turn resulution turns it into a real mind game, very strategic. Have to predict the others move in every turn. Commander system:Having three commanders and seting deck (faction) purity with them is very good, makes deckbuilding fun. Need to chose three creatures to be your commanders, can play them straight from command zone or use their ability, but they are vournable to some attacks (Perils of command, assassinate), and are revealed to your opponent from the start.The artwork is good, some are very good (""Give him a jetpack!"" XD), the animation makes it look even better.I feel that that those who don't want to pay are not forced to grind for long hours to stand a chance. (Pauper deck format good for new players). Good for casuals too. Campaign to get cards, get to know the factions and gameplay and some backstory. Story is not mindblowing, but this is a TCG so it doesn't need to be.Maybe a bit buggy at times, but the devs are fixing it in good time (nothing game breaking).			"

												This is a game similar to Magic: The Gathering.  It is different from MTG in many ways.  The first is that the turns are taken simultaneously.  You play all the cards you want either from your hand, or move them around the battlefield.  When you have made all the changes you would like to make you hit end turn.  Your opponent has been doing the same thing on his side.  Once both players have hit end turn the turn resolves, with abilities resolving before attacks.Another difference is the gathering of resources to be able to play cards.  In Infinity Wars it automatically increases each turn, there is no need to play resource generating cards.Scoring is also different.  In Infinity wars you have what amounts to two different damage counters, one for your fortress and one for morale.  If either one reaches 0 you lose.  If one of your creatures attacks unblocked it will do damage to the fortress.  When a creature is killed its morale value is deducted from its owner's total.There is an Academy which will teach you how to use the different types of cards, with Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced areas.  When you complete all the sections in an area you are presented with a graduation challenge to help reinforce the subject areas.  There is also a single player campaign that will help you to learn about the different factions.  The game is currently in Early Access Beta, and there are a few glitches.  I have not run into any that make me want to stop playing.  As you play you earn rewards which can be turned into additional cards and booster packs.  You also earn experience points, and along with experience points Infinity Points.  The Infinity Points can be used to buy additional decks, and booster packs.  If you want to get extra cards faster you can purchase them using funds in your Steam Wallet, but anything you can buy without funds by using Infinity Points which you earn by playing.The game is now out of beta, and in full release.  There have been some balance changes, some good some not, but it is still a great game to play.  There are also new expansion sets which add more cards to the game.			"

								So far, this game has impressed me. At first, I thought it would just be some card game that I would play for a small amount of time and never come back too. However, its alot more than that, and I would recommend this to any TCG players, or even people who want to learn more about TCGS. 9.5/10. Waiting for the update for even more content :D.			"

								Infinity Wars chose a desperate time to release. With the recent release of the Hearthstone open beta, many people will be swarming to that and overlooking this TCG. Unfortunatly for them, they'll be missing out on an amazing game. Firstly, over Hearthstone, it actually has a comprehensive single player. It also has numerous factions, all of which have definitive styles of play. Most of the cards are well balanced (With a few exceptions, Verore Death Worshipper anyone?), and it's possible to get cards quite quickly. Additionaly, it has mechanics that shake up the usual set-up that was introduced by Magic:The Gathering, and they work wonderfully. Microtransactions might be a slight problem for some, as not all of the shop items can be bought with in-game currency, but it doesn't stick out too much. There's also a slight problem with the tutorials, as they require you to beat minor puzzles to get through them, and some people might not have the time for that. The biggest problems I've had with the game are glitches. It is an early access game, yes, but it constantly worries me. Firstly by appearantly losing my level 2 reward, then by temporarily getting rid of my progress, it can get pretty annoying. Overall though, Infinity Wars wins my vote over with it's varied card types, interesting mechanics, and beautiful animation.			"

												Infinity Wars will show you that TCGs were meant to be on a virtual platform.The artwork of its fully-animated cards is absolutely magnificent and supported by a rich and continuously evolving lore. It will satisfy all hard-core TCG fans with its simultaneous turns and strategic mechanics as well as various ladder and competition systems. As for the newcomers, a well designed training ground is prepared for all the factions of the game and will introduce you to all the basics and lore while rewarding you every step of the way with cards and rewards and with each new coming day just for logging in All that being said, its greatest feature is its awesome and welcoming community that you’ll rapidly get to know, especially if you hang around the Live Streams of the game and the entertaining gamers hosting them.Definitely try out this free-to-play, super fun card game and witness with us the exciting adventure that is the Infinity Wars with its community and the passionate team behind the game, working every day on improving, balancing and growing this game into an institution that will revolutionize its genre.See you on the battlefield!

												This is a game similar to Magic: The Gathering.  It is different from MTG in many ways.  The first is that the turns are taken simultaneously.  You play all the cards you want either from your hand, or move them around the battlefield.  When you have made all the changes you would like to make you hit end turn.  Your opponent has been doing the same thing on his side.  Once both players have hit end turn the turn resolves, with abilities resolving before attacks.Another difference is the gathering of resources to be able to play cards.  In Infinity Wars it automatically increases each turn, there is no need to play resource generating cards.Scoring is also different.  In Infinity wars you have what amounts to two different damage counters, one for your fortress and one for morale.  If either one reaches 0 you lose.

								Infinity Wars is a pretty decent DTCG (Digital Trading Card Game). I came in to the game, honestly expecting it to suck. I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was the game fun, it was easy to learn. As the title of the game shows the cards themselves are indeed animated and there is a lot going on besides just the standard ""lay card on table"" gameplay. I find the fact that there are quite a few modes to play and a large number of themed factions another thing this game has going for it. So far there seems to be a good amount of players but only time will tell if that will last. You have some say as well after all, you should try it you might just find a new favorite.			"

												I can't even sign up. The game app you get via steam is poorly coded and while creating an account, doesn't have all the neccesary feilds required to create an account. This causes you to always get a ""Missing country"" error when clicking create.The website is equally poorly coded. It doesn't tell you which format to put the birthdate in (apperently its yyyy-dd-mm with dashes and not / like it is EVERY WHERE ELSE, so this also ends in endless errors as you try to figure out the exact format it wants. Simple fix is to put this YYYY-DD-MM right next to the fields, but what do i know.Don't reccomend, users shouldnt have to jump through hoops just to create an account.1/10 coudlnt even play.			"

												A quality digital TCG featuring some interesting design choices, such as simultaneously played turns, that while it has a seeminly highly limited pool of around 500 cards, allows for a great deal of flexibility. It's still very rough around the edges, but the improvements, features and contents come at a staggering pace. Out of any TCG, few can call themselves ""free"", but Infinity Wars really doesn't lie about itself. While earning new cards isn't speedy, it certainly is possible!I do very much recommend!			"

Every players uses the same deck and the same tactics because basically you can't counter that necromancer deck. So, no. I DO NOT recommend this game unless they balance that out.			"

												TL:DR ; The game is amazing , Best Tcg out there but is almost dead now. So do play it even if you are not into card games , i think its a must play for every gamer.  just Dont spend money on it beacuse of its current state Full ReviewBest TCG ever  in terms of mechanics and startegy ,every other TCG out there is a distant second. This game is the best as well as my fav. But the bugs , sheer negligence of the community by devs  has ruined this masterpiece.WHAT IW can offer that no one else canAnimated cards - Seriously at first they dont seem too big of deal but once you get used to it you wont be able to go back to any other game, the art of some cards is really amazing Game mechanics - the presence of 4 diffrent zones ( command zone is an IW exclusive thing and is a game changer) , the purity combinations (the fact that you can mix diffrent classes adds so much verstality to the game )Morale as a winning condition - In almost every game ""Health"" is the decisive parameter using which a victory is abtained but IW adds another parameter ""Morale"" , Its not only the  health of your fortress you have to take care of but also the morale of your army allowing immense variety of strategies and playstylesTHE FLAWSLooks Shabby - The cards look amzaning but overall the game looks quite dull Bugs - This game has a lot of bugs , the game will often crash , trade will freeze, desyncs in matches ,the list is quite long tbh, but not a dealbreaker just close to itFuture is uncertain - the final nail in the coffin , the game  is almost dead , most of the vetrans have left the game , rest are planning to , no communication from devs ,there are talks that some other team/company will take over IW and start it from scratch To be honest no one knows your guess is as good as mine I would recommend that you atleast try the game once , its a F2P so there is nothing to lose			"

^^I did a whole 20+ hour review of MMDOC and guess how the community reacted to my honest critiques of the game?Spoiler Alert, the fanbois didn't like my criteque of their MMDOC game.  You can watch my video series as the community goes from helping a new player to toxic vile hatred when pointing out that the game requires much more grinding (free2play) when compared to Hearthstone.Anyways, I'm one of those guys that refuses to recommend a free to play game that isn't fun to play for free.

												Honestly, I love this game. The rules are very simple but the depth of complexity due to all the different cards and factions is vast. But it all comes down to skill anyway. A good player with a bad deck can easily beat a bad player with an amazing deck. This game is not super well known yet but it's about to be re-branded pretty soon which will bring in a rush of new players. Until then, it is truly a diamond in the rough and I'm glad I stumbled upon it. Plus it's free. So...can't go wrong with that.			"

												Try Infinity Wars. It's interactive, intellectual and packs some great innovations into a neatly designed TCG. - Simultaneous Turns- Inherent Anticipation & Deception- 3 Guaranteed Cards per Player- Inherent Hand Management MechanicsThe art and lore aren't to my taste, but this is still one of my favorite TCGs. The gameplay relies on your ability to anticipate your opponent and defy their expectations. It's strategic in the same vein as a high stakes game of poker. A lot of times when I play any of a dozen better known TCGs, it feels like my opponent and I are playing 2 independent games of solitaire. This game could not be further from that.			"

								Ok, after giving the game a real try, i've seen some really cool things that i've liked. First off, I love card games so this game suckered me in when I saw it in the free games tab. One of the coolest features I saw and enjoyed, was the attack and defence zones, it makes way for real strategy, for example if you have a monster with loads of defence but very poor attack, you can put it in your defence zone to soak up damage your enemy is dealing, and vice versa wih cards with good attack but poor defence. This game reminds me of magic, not In a ripoff way, but In a good influnce sort of way. it's good to have a foundation somewere, and face it, even if it's not had any influence from MTG, fanboys are gonna rage hard simply because It's a card game where you attack people. I haven't played the game long enought to report any bugs, but for now, with the interesting tactics thrown in, I'm going to give this beta a 7/10. It's free, so download it, what have you got to lose?			"

								Infinity Wars is a pretty decent DTCG (Digital Trading Card Game). I came in to the game, honestly expecting it to suck. I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was the game fun, it was easy to learn. As the title of the game shows the cards themselves are indeed animated and there is a lot going on besides just the standard ""lay card on table"" gameplay. I find the fact that there are quite a few modes to play and a large number of themed factions another thing this game has going for it. So far there seems to be a good amount of players but only time will tell if that will last. You have some say as well after all, you should try it you might just find a new favorite.			"

												I can't even sign up. The game app you get via steam is poorly coded and while creating an account, doesn't have all the neccesary feilds required to create an account. This causes you to always get a ""Missing country"" error when clicking create.The website is equally poorly coded. It doesn't tell you which format to put the birthdate in (apperently its yyyy-dd-mm with dashes and not / like it is EVERY WHERE ELSE, so this also ends in endless errors as you try to figure out the exact format it wants. Simple fix is to put this YYYY-DD-MM right next to the fields, but what do i know.Don't reccomend, users shouldnt have to jump through hoops just to create an account.1/10 coudlnt even play.			"

												Okay, after a long time of playing this I am finally going to write a recommendation.Infinity Wars is simply awesome, I've never felt compelled to play a game for this long. (Seriously, check my Steam account.)It has an amazing deep strategic background and even without paying a single dime you can become one of the top 100 players in no time. I see enough people in top 100 already that didn't spend a single cent on the game.You get plenty of cards for each campaign you complete, as well as every time you level up.You cannot compare this game to something like, for example, Hearthstone. It's not a very casual game. You need to devote time and effort to learn everything but once you figure everything out you will be dominating your foes within days. The tutorial missions are funny and nicely done without being too boring. The campaign is exciting and definitely one of the strong points about the game. (A bit of fanboy hype here, since I'm really invested in the lore of this game.)If you want a good cardgame and something you don't need to fear that P2P players will have an advantage, this game is for you.PS:The Devs answer Steam forum posts nearly hourly, are always helpful and really really kind.Update:After a long time of not having played this game I came back too see that a new dev picked it up and made it even better.This one seems honest about the game and I am so exited too finally start playing it again!So see you soon ingame!

Here is how you should understand card games right now, I will only list pros for simplicity's sake)Hearthstone - League of Legends (simple, large community)Infinity wars - DOTA 2 (advanced mechanics, very skill dependent)MTG - Smite (stylish, very balanced)Go Fish - Adventure Time Battle Arena (lolwut)			"

								Great game! I played MTG for a number of years and enjoyed it but for online TCG this game is better. No need to worry about getting mana screwed and the way they have it you can create diffrent decks putting together diff factions but with the purity system some cards need to be played with only one or two factions. For new players there is also a system that lets you play with someone and you both get xp an infinity points(in game currency) as well as free cards. Must play!!			"

												Very easy to pick up, and can pick up hundreds of good cards without paying. But to get to ranked play, you have to be level 20, and that takes like 40 hours of sheer grinding. And in rift-runs, you will get annhilated by better veteran players, so those aren't a valid option early on. It's a bit more strategic than Hearthstone, though.			"

												First of... What a unique new style of TCG and I love it.  The simultaneous play makes it so strategical as you discover the game that it's hard to stop trying out the various game styles.What about the price? I want to emphasis this because people always talk about 'pay 2 win' in these kind of games and it is logical that if you want many cards really fast, you'd have to spend a few dollars. Imagine if Magic Cards were all free. + there are many ways to get free boosters if you don't feel like spending right away. The price of a booster is as little as a dollar so nothing to complain about on this section. - Finally you can still really enjoy the game without paying anything.MAIN ISSUE ABOUT THE GAME!- This is a real problem. You'll probably encounter many server disconnection at first due to your firewall or antivirus, so put them down or let the game go through your firewall. Once you've done it, it is fine. Although, many times the game freezes or disconnects because of the other player maybe, or I don't know why. But when you are in the middle of a rift run, which you are only allowed to loose 3 times, as soon as the game freezes, that's a loss. This is very frustrating and I hope that some kind of system will help recognise which player f***¨s the game up and let's the other safe.That's it. I have been playing for 10 days, love it and I want to keep playing. Haven't tried trading yet or ranked pvp but looking forward to discover more about this awesome game!			"

												The game is fun but lack incentive to go on. I am really on the verge of uninstalling this game because there is nothing to do except play a normal match against other player and to gain level and eventually get booster packs. The main fun in this game is getting new cards and emplying those cards to play. But i am limited to the basic decks given after the opening mission and a few boosters. And the only way I see about getting more cards are 1. log in daily and get ONE card. Come on man. One card is not even worth the log in. And another by daily playing three matches. still not worth the log in. And level up which takes too long. It would take me years before I could get going with a deck beyond the basic core decks. Probably a decade to get the perfect deck. Why bother?  If you want to see a good marketing which build incentive for players go on see the game called ""puzzle and dragons"" in iOS. it the perfect model for getting ppl hooked.			"

								Oh man, what's with all the great CCGs lately?The obvious comparison is the other big F2P CCG, Hearthstone And I'd say that this... isn't as good. It lacks Hearthstone's puzzle element and simplicity, there's just not the same feeling of trying to predict and counter the opponent's strategy. The simultaneous turns helps with this a LITTLE bit, but it's just not good enough. Also, cards aren't as easy to come by without trading. And in comparison to Magic The Gathering it just doesn't have quite the same level of depth and option that MTG's massive amount of cards has.But I'd still put this as miles better than any other TCG! So yeah, I'd really recommend trying it out.			"

As in the real world you can buy booster packs, etc. I am not a big fan of card based games, but this one was really fun. I am not interested in devoting anymore time to learning the game, though; largely because I don't really enjoy cards outside of poker. Uninstalled.			"

												Downloaded and had a couple of days fun but this game, along with other card games (CCGs in particular) suffers from the fact that there are just too many cards in the card pool, which is a barrier to entry. I probably could have got into it when it came out but its just too much of a time investment to learn all the cards in the card pool before you can even begin to play properly. But hey cant complain about the few hours I got out of it for free. Just a warning for new players - Prepare to spend a lot of time grinding in order to even think about making a deck that isn't just a bunch of cards mishmashed together.			"

I appreciated the tutorial battles, which had minimal hand-holding while still explaining everything very well. The few AI battles I’ve had outside the tutorial so far were challenging enough to be fun, but not so challenging that I felt like the AI was cheating.

												Great game. I love the art on the cards and I love the way the battles go. You win some and you lose some. There may be some downsides to this game, but there are many more upsides than downsides.			"

												Fun game if you like trading card games. It is a given that this is pay to win, because it is a card trading games. As in the real world you can buy booster packs, etc. I am not a big fan of card based games, but this one was really fun. I am not interested in devoting anymore time to learning the game, though; largely because I don't really enjoy cards outside of poker. Uninstalled.			"

												Even if you're not a trading card game person like I wasn't, give this a try. I've played this a lot on and off for a couple years since when I've tried other TCGs such as Hearthstone too. And my final conclusion is that Inifity Wars is the best digital card game out there. Here's why:- F2P model is fine. Free cards every day you log on/Play you first few game/Complete Quests & Acheivements- Incredible art on the cards- Brilliant universe for the cards... it's creepy and enthralling with a great take on the undead- Final Fantasy grade soundtrack- The deepest strategy out of any TCG I've played by far- Simultaneous turns (Less waiting around and it allows for more complex strategies)- Wonderful, imaginative faction/classes which are MIXABLE in each deck you create.- Massive amount of cards and strategiesThe only cons that I can see really are:- Why isn't this game getting more attention?- Although the game itself is very tight, the program and gui itself could use a little work.- The menu system could be better, smoother and streamlined etc.			"

Early Access Review
								Well there are some things the devs can do to improve this game! Namely separate the login server from the game servers. Hope they do get more servers. The lag now and at the release of the Infestation is unbearable. The draft freezing and never recovering is a common bug REAL BUG that requires a relog. But that should all be resolved soon! I would hope to see some more variable play in the bot decks. I would also like to see less distractions in the drafting - ie no relogs. In the draft there should be a way to see your cards. But zooming in on them in the battles is unneccessary. I'd like to see longer campaigns and more trading options. I really want to see more player communications in the drafting - at least hello and good game! But none of that will matter if they don't fix the lag issues.On the positive side this game really rocks! The game play is quite deep and really addictive.			"

												Downloaded and had a couple of days fun but this game, along with other card games (CCGs in particular) suffers from the fact that there are just too many cards in the card pool, which is a barrier to entry. I probably could have got into it when it came out but its just too much of a time investment to learn all the cards in the card pool before you can even begin to play properly. But hey cant complain about the few hours I got out of it for free. Just a warning for new players - Prepare to spend a lot of time grinding in order to even think about making a deck that isn't just a bunch of cards mishmashed together.			"

								Very interesting mechanics, best part is that you can play pretty much play the whole game without spending a single cent! Really commited moderators and cozy communit. However, bug fixes should be more often and servers could use some more juice. Overall, a very promising game and relatively well done for early access!			"

												Although it kinda suffers from low pop, it's one of the most engaging and fast paced online card games out there, and you can comfortably enjoy casual play with zero to minimal investment.I suspect that high tier competitive play might be a bit cringy since some of the rare cards seem excessively strong, but that's the case with most CCGs out there.9/10 for me			"

												Infinity Wars can easily become a pretty addicting game for anyone that enjoys trading card games. The fact that every card has animated artwork is a nice touch, as well.The community is pretty nice, and the developers actively join in to better understand what people desire, as well as keeping a steady stream of updates flowing. As a Magic the Gathering player, I was easily able to jump right into Infinity Wars, learning the rules, and catching up on the lore. All in all, this game's a keeper. 10/10			"

												Imagine if the finer aspects of Hearthstone and the better aspects of Magic: The Gathering had a love-child. This child recieved more of the good traits from MtG, and a Hearthstone-like deck-customization. Playing the campaigns and against bots will net you many, many cards. You can even do practice booster pack draft games. It is very open to new players consistently and it doesn't feel as pay-to win as Hearthstone is. Granted there's plenty of monetization, but that's the concession made with free to play.			"

												Very easy to pick up, and can pick up hundreds of good cards without paying. But to get to ranked play, you have to be level 20, and that takes like 40 hours of sheer grinding. And in rift-runs, you will get annhilated by better veteran players, so those aren't a valid option early on. It's a bit more strategic than Hearthstone, though.			"

												First of... What a unique new style of TCG and I love it.  The simultaneous play makes it so strategical as you discover the game that it's hard to stop trying out the various game styles.What about the price? I want to emphasis this because people always talk about 'pay 2 win' in these kind of games and it is logical that if you want many cards really fast, you'd have to spend a few dollars. Imagine if Magic Cards were all free. + there are many ways to get free boosters if you don't feel like spending right away. The price of a booster is as little as a dollar so nothing to complain about on this section. - Finally you can still really enjoy the game without paying anything.MAIN ISSUE ABOUT THE GAME!- This is a real problem. You'll probably encounter many server disconnection at first due to your firewall or antivirus, so put them down or let the game go through your firewall. Once you've done it, it is fine. Although, many times the game freezes or disconnects because of the other player maybe, or I don't know why. But when you are in the middle of a rift run, which you are only allowed to loose 3 times, as soon as the game freezes, that's a loss. This is very frustrating and I hope that some kind of system will help recognise which player f***¨s the game up and let's the other safe.That's it. I have been playing for 10 days, love it and I want to keep playing. Haven't tried trading yet or ranked pvp but looking forward to discover more about this awesome game!			"

												As you can see, I've played many hours & it's a great game because most of the time a quick games a great game. It doesn't really matter who you vs it's how you play with some already made up decks for newcomers which also changes every now & then which will be an amazing help for them & with some luck you can almost win every match up depending if you understand the mechs.Whenever I'm in a rush & have 5 - 10 minutes to spare I play this. In my opinion, it's worth the download because there are not that many great card games out there that are quick, fun, slightly addictive making want to jump right into the next match straight away one after the other before realizing an hour has passed.8/10 Amazing game			"

								Oh man, what's with all the great CCGs lately?The obvious comparison is the other big F2P CCG, Hearthstone And I'd say that this... isn't as good. It lacks Hearthstone's puzzle element and simplicity, there's just not the same feeling of trying to predict and counter the opponent's strategy. The simultaneous turns helps with this a LITTLE bit, but it's just not good enough. Also, cards aren't as easy to come by without trading. And in comparison to Magic The Gathering it just doesn't have quite the same level of depth and option that MTG's massive amount of cards has.But I'd still put this as miles better than any other TCG! So yeah, I'd really recommend trying it out.			"

												The game is fun but lack incentive to go on. I am really on the verge of uninstalling this game because there is nothing to do except play a normal match against other player and to gain level and eventually get booster packs. The main fun in this game is getting new cards and emplying those cards to play. But i am limited to the basic decks given after the opening mission and a few boosters. And the only way I see about getting more cards are 1. log in daily and get ONE card. Come on man. One card is not even worth the log in. And another by daily playing three matches. still not worth the log in. And level up which takes too long. It would take me years before I could get going with a deck beyond the basic core decks. Probably a decade to get the perfect deck. Why bother?  If you want to see a good marketing which build incentive for players go on see the game called ""puzzle and dragons"" in iOS. it the perfect model for getting ppl hooked.			"

												For an online TCG, it's great. The best one I've played. I can't say much about it, cause it's pretty much just what you'd expect. MTG + Hearthstone = Infinity WarsPros: * Trading concept. Although you can't trade certain cards, you can still trade which is part of what makes a card game fun IMO.* There's a fair bit of helpful players in the community willing to help you.* It's got a good start for new players, IE, the pauper game mode to allow you to level up and not have to worry about the meta game.* You level up and get cards from fighting your friends, so, even if no one plays pauper, you still have your noob friends to farm on.Cons:* No one plays pauper.* If you want to get anywhere you have to play infinity. The downside to playing infinity, anything is allowed, which means all trump cards and meta game, so not easy for new players.* ♥♥♥♥ing zombie decks. Anyone who is new in these times apparently, have to wathc out for zombie decks. They are horrid, and they can't be stopped. I've tried so many different decks and I still can't beat anyone who uses zombies in their deck. ♥♥♥♥ zombies, they're overpowered. They're like MTGs black hydra decks. They power themselves up through the deaths of their own, and have other things from other deck types to power them up. Unstoppable. No not the card type, they're literally unstoppable.* The match ups in this game is just horrid. They pair you with a guy who's been playing for maybe a year even though you started yesterday, who the ♥♥♥♥ do you think is gonna win in that scenario?			"

Although you can't trade certain cards, you can still trade which is part of what makes a card game fun IMO.* There's a fair bit of helpful players in the community willing to help you.* It's got a good start for new players, IE, the pauper game mode to allow you to level up and not have to worry about the meta game.* You level up and get cards from fighting your friends, so, even if no one plays pauper, you still have your noob friends to farm on.Cons:* No one plays pauper.* If you want to get anywhere you have to play infinity. The downside to playing infinity, anything is allowed, which means all trump cards and meta game, so not easy for new players.* ♥♥♥♥ing zombie decks. Anyone who is new in these times apparently, have to wathc out for zombie decks. They are horrid, and they can't be stopped. I've tried so many different decks and I still can't beat anyone who uses zombies in their deck. ♥♥♥♥ zombies, they're overpowered. They're like MTGs black hydra decks. They power themselves up through the deaths of their own, and have other things from other deck types to power them up. Unstoppable. No not the card type, they're literally unstoppable.* The match ups in this game is just horrid. They pair you with a guy who's been playing for maybe a year even though you started yesterday, who the ♥♥♥♥ do you think is gonna win in that scenario?			"

												Don't get me wrong I absolutely love this game, but after seeing only ""want to sell my account"" messages in the global chat it soons become very clear that the community has long abandoned this game.What starts as a fun and easy to learn TCG soon becomes hollow when the PvP queues become unending because of the lack of players and the only messages in the chat are those of long time players trying to get a little bit of money for all their hard work.Such a shame.

												Well, it's not magic the gathering, but that's not all bad. The online play is quick enough to pair me with someone. I don't do well in the drafts, but they are also my biggest pet peave about this game. I feel like if I pay to enter a draft then I should keep the cards like in the magic the gathering game. I understand that is an option at the end, but it is overpriced. If there was a closed entry (limited to x amount of people) draft system tournaments, where you paid more to enter, and kept your cards, I would play them much more often.			"

												Infinity Wars is the type of digital TCG that blows you away on many fronts.  It has many innovative features and in a lot of ways it is the best digital TCG out there (though it has some shortcomings).  Why do I believe this?-  All the cards have animated art!  Yep, you heard that right.  This gives the game an aesthetic value and beauty that is unmatched by most other digital tcg's.  Some of these cards have full animations!-  The tactical depth of this game blows away all other TCG's.   You have a support zone, assault zone, defense zone, and command zone.  It's easy to get used to and allows for a lot of tactical depth.  If Hearthstone is checkers, this is chess.-  The factions are cool, cards have a lot of flavor, there are custom battlegrounds, card backs, avatars, and card effects you can purchase.   But it is NOT pay to win.  You can unlock packs pretty easily without spending a dime; trust me, I didn't spend any money for a very long time.  But eventually I started to spend money on some of the preorders when new sets were released.   -  Yes, you can actually trade cards with other people so it is a true TCG.-  The draft format is fun and doesn't cost a lot of points.  And yes, you can buy in using Infinity Points that you earn in the game so once again - you don't have to spend money.-  There are ranking systems, prizes, etc.  Some of the Downfalls:-  It needs more players so I'm hoping this new release draws in a new audience.-  There were bugs from time to time in the past, though ever since a new company bought the game, I haven't run into any more bugs.  So this seems improved.Conclusion: This is an amazing game.  Play it, get a couple of your friends to play it, and help it blossom.  There is real potential here. "

So much innovation, very little RNG,, and so much potential for mind games and to outplay your opponent. LITERALLY the only thing keeping this game from becoming HUGE is its small playerbase. If people gave it a chance they would be hooked.So YES, TRY THIS GAME OUT!			"

												I've been playing for several years now, and I wanted to write an honest review, so here it is.tl;dR: skip to the Conclusion at the bottom.This game is an exceptionally good DTCG (Digital Trading Card Game), it kicks MtG and other cards games (Hstone) butt by far, which is saying a lot considering both those games are made by huge companies.OverviewThis is a Free game that manages to give a balanced and challenging experience while avoiding P2W (Pay to Win) altogether. It focus on strategy, anticipating your opponent's moves (thanks to simultaneos turns, see below), and its artistic aspect is excelent (all cards are fully animated).Pros:+ It's Free! You can play this game for free, or you can choose to spend some bucks in it to get more cards. Even if you don't want to spend real money, you can still get the same cards by playing and earning in-game free currency which will allow you to get boosters with more cards. You also get free cards almost daily.+ Real TCG. There's a reason TCG are called that way, Infinity Wars Reborn lets you trade your spare cards to get the ones you need, be it for building a better deck or just to complete your collection (there's a collectible aspect with premium cards that have platinum or gold borders, and foil effects).+ Simultaneos Turns: One of the strongest points of this game is simultaneos turns. Unlike MtG where you play, then your opponent plays, and so on, in Infinity Wars Reborn you both play and the turn resolves at the same time, so you need to try to anticipate if your opponent will attack, defend, use abilities, etc, which makes for some very interesting mind games, and actually requires skills, not just having 'good cards'.+ Animated cards! Each and every card is animated. I dare you to find another free online card game that offers you the same (100% animated cards). Not only that, the artwork is just amazing, professional artists work on this game and the quality is superb.+ Competitive, challenging and balanced gameplay. Infinity Wars Reborn has many factions you can play with, they are all balanced and they can all beat each other in many (I really mean it: many!) different ways. The amount of strategies and combinations is endless, and two people using the exact same deck can still use the cards in very different ways to win.+ Good starting card collection. When you make an account and start playing, after you go through the tutorials, you can play the Campaign, and you'll be rewarded with pre-made decks of each faction (WIP) after you complete each campaign. Not only that, you get a free 5-cards booster each time you level up. As if that wasn't enough, you can complete daily quests to get in-game currency (which you can spend to get more cards), and you also get a free daily reward just for logging in (cards from different rarities, XP boosters, and even 5-card boosters). It's incredible the amount of cards this game gives you for free.+ Store. When you play you win IP (Infinity Points), these is the free in-game currency which you can spend to get more cards. You can also spend real money if you want, either to get more cards or to dress up your battlefield and decks with beautiful artwork.Cons:- Some minor bugs that are still being worked on. Development is slow from time to time, but these guys aren't Wizards of the Coast or Blizzards, so it's to be expected.- Lacks proper marketing, this game is ideal for streaming and chilling, but somehow it's not that known (yet).- Addictive, you'll find yourself wanting to play moar and moar. You have been warned.Conclusion (rating: 8/10):If you like TCGs, if you have ever played MtG in real life and miss the feeling it gave you the first time you played it, then you need to try Infinity Wars Reborn. It's a rock-solid card game with beautiful artwork.			"

												Very good concept. Goes far and beyond with the strategic element of predicting and simultaneous turns [think a bit like competitive pokemon style]. Mechanics are quite fun to play around with and there is trading, which is a big plus. Balance may be very iffy temporarily with the new set out though. Previously it's actually been pretty decent with around 8 top meta decks. Although they tend to revolve around 2-3 factions, all of the factions were included at least somewhat in the top meta decks. Caveat with that is, some factions require rarer cards [epics legendaries] to be more viable than other factions.Would recommend, but with a grain of salt:This game doesn't seem to be progressing very fast. Various bugs plague the interface while the new publisher for the game has been more active in stamping bugs out, it seems to still always be rather buggy.			"

All the others are pretty much the same, but not ths one.			"

From the gorgeous artwork to some of the craziest underdog wins I've seen, I don't think I'll ever stop playing until the game stops living. It's been a long time coming and progress is a little slow but it's great overall. The game is really picking up steam (eyyyyy) and I can't wait until we're drowning in content and players.

It's strategical, with a lot of unique combos that can be unleashed. it's no a Pay-2-Win TCG because I haven't bought anything from this game (I'm so sorry LM :((( I'm only a student) and I can personally say that I have built strong rank-worthy decks. AND OF COURSE, THE ♥♥♥♥ING ARTWORK. As an Art Student, I ♥♥♥♥ing appreciate Lilariah's subtle boob bounce every time her artwork loops. It's unique, and the artwork themselves are incredible.Of course, there are some flaws here and there, but not something that can ruin the entire game. Overall, this game rocks.			"

												The game have an unique playstyle, with an even more unique card system, as they are all animated and gorgeous. You will, for sure, spend all your time, after making your play, looking the animations of every card in the match. Believe me, you will. As far as balance goes, I can't tell much, but I must say, in my opinion, that IW is not a pay to win game. You can make a good deck by being totally free to player. Better, you can make a really competitve deck like that, not spending much time per day, as long as you stay active. Just finish the campaing and you definately are going to be interested in playing this game forever, just because of the nice artwork and storyline the game have.			"

												I've been playing this game since the very beginning of the beta, long before it was Reborn. I've seen it go through some ups and downs. I enjoy the game and the concept of the game. It's pretty unique with simultaneous turns, which are simultaneously (yep, I did it.) great and maddening. It's fun trying to predict and outwit your opponent before you hit the end turn button and see the results as they play out, but also sad and a bit maddening when you get it wrong. The cards are entirely animated, unlike other games where it's just the premium versions. The major downside at the moment is the small size of the current community. Hopefully it can get some steam behind it and grow.			"

												IW:ATCG is the next step in strategic CCG's. They build upon previous popular CCG's so if you are new to the scene, it may be difficult to catch on. Hell, I've been playing MTG for years and I had a bit of trouble. While the verbage on the card is not always clear, there is a wiki on the different types that can help you get a grasp of the concepts. This is where experience comes in handy. There is also a twist on the ""stack"" that many MTG players are familiar with. While cards play out in order, any character cards placed in the way of the effects after the fact are affected. There is also the concept of ""initiative,"" which begins randomly with either player and causes that players ""stack"" to resolve first. It's an interesting concept that creates a whole new dimension to gameplay and is used to develop strategies that would never be considered outside of this particular game. I enjoy the new rule and look forward to using it. However, the game still seems new. There are many details that could be worked out for rules and what is considered a ""character."" This is the verbage I was speaking about above. Sure there are more examples, but most can be worked out while playing the tutorial campaigns and there are sufficient AI's to test your decks prior to delving into PvP. IW:ATCG does have an arena style mode where you create a deck from random cards ala Hearthstone. I have yet to test those waters. Overall I think it could develop into something fun, and is already interesting. I look forward to playing more and will update my review accordingly.			"

												I have been playing this card game off and on for over a year I think. It started out just looking for something a little different from other card games. Saw this was free to play and bam! I got hooked to it. The fact that it has a single player and many different types of ways to play with other people. There is a cool campaign mode where you can play as a faction from anywhere between 4 to 6 missions. Each mission getting more difficult, to make you find combos and learn some important mechanics to the game that will help you play against other people. This also rewards you with free decks of cards. After you beat all the campaign you end up with a pretty decent card pool to make decks that you want to experiment with and play against other people. This game also has an group of advanced tutorials (aka Academy tab) where you learn some excellent strats to help you win future matches. I enjoyed this game so much i got a few family members to play it with me and they have really enjoyed it as well. It has a lot of different factions that each do something a little different or have completely different strats. The Community seems to be really awesome and helpful as well. It isn't toxic like a lot of other games I have played in the past. The only negatives I think I have about the game have to do with connection issues I've had personally lately. But the Studio behind the game is helping me to fix it. So give it a real shot, play more than 2 or 3 games and you will be hooked too.  "

												well, where to start, its a  great game, which has the classic vampires, demons,humans, animal and the undead and some others, although i hardly played on this game i could say that this mmay be close to beating yugioh, however the gameplay wont get old any time soon, but i just wish they made more factions like orcs for example. this game surely is a good game to spend time on.

												Infinity Wars tries a lot of bold new things. Some of these succeed, while others do not.Firstly, and unfortunately most importantly, the game is genuinely free to play. It isn't Heartstone free to play, where non-paying players need to grind for years to accumulate the same quality of cards as someone who spends $1000. IW lives up to its name. A new player has the potential to build a competitive deck from just the cards he receives from the tutorial, and initial booster packs ('soulbound packs'). Those who choose to spend are able to gain platinum cards (just shiny), better artwork, sounds, effects, etc, and more cards to play with, BUT THESE CARDS ARE NOT NECESSARILY ANY BETTER. They are just more options to explore should you get bored of using the same, but highly effective, strategy every game. No cards are locked behind a pay-wall, although if you want to build a deck with 10+ legendaries in it (that is NOT NECESSARILY BETTER THAN A DECK WITH 0 LEGENDARIES), be prepared to pay or grind.There isn't much to say about the artworks or effects. If you like them, great. If not, you don't. There's no option to turn them off, but then again, we aren't playing Microsoft Excel.The community is also extremely active, for its size. It is certainly no Heartstone, which has the publishing collosus of Blizzard behind it, nor is it Yugioh, where even in my relatively small town there are frequently 20-30 player tournaments with prizes. The developers, too, are frequently active on the forums, and this game has been patched at once a month since I began to play. I say this with absolute confidence; if this game has a larger player base, it has the potential to lead the market with its innovation and new ideas.Why, then, do I NOT recommend this game for you?It's free, so there's no harm trying. But as you progress beyond Puffy the Fish and encounter more and more cards and combinations, you will realise one serious flaw in the game design. The devs have shown they are not a money laundering scheme, and genuinely wish to see this game develop into something for the gamers to enjoy. They design and maintain their game with all the best intentions, but unfortunately in this case it does not equate to results.Infinity Wars has a unique turn system unlike Heartstone, MTG, Yugioh, etc. I remember something similar in some Marvel DC comic card game ages ago, and that is that both players have their turns at the same time. Not only is this extremely confusing for new players (this, and the copious amount of addon-systems that are needed as a result, to determine things like card resolution order, etc), it is also fundamentally incompatible with their card design, which follows a far more traditional MTG/Yugioh approach.In short,  the cards for this game do not match the rules for this game. It is like eating Butter Chicken Flavoured Ice Cream, driving to work in a $2999 bottle of wine eating your favourite hamburger while diving into a beautiful coral reef. Oil and water don't mix. Or, for a more contextual example, like throwing a pokemon card into Yugioh. What are energies??? At best, this system leads to frustrating gameplay, where both players are reluctant to do anything out of fear, that they will incorrectly anticipate between two WHOLLY VALID courses of play and thus screw themselves over for the rest of the game. At worst, this creates massive imbalances in the game due to some cards being overpowered in the context in which they are placed. For example, 'draw 3 cards' is a common effect in pokemon. Put that card into yugioh, and it will completely break the game.The game has a great community, great ambitions and has the potential to change the face of TCG games. However, this is no easy task, and despite the best intentions of the DEVS, clearly indicated by the fact that the game is not pay to win, the gaping flaws in the game's current fundamental design will not allow it to provide a largely positive experience.

Posted: March 31, 2014
												Final Review 9/5/2014Honestly, I'd like to say that I had a whole bunch of information to drop upon IW's release, but I don't. Release for this game was not so much a bang but a very timid whimper. My honest opinion is that it felt rushed if solid, giving it a very mediocre launch.There are no big changes so I can't find my revised review changing all that much. Several much-needed card fixes were implemented, but that's not what should set a gold release apart. The truth is there's no point in adopting this game at all as it sits, if you played beta you're not missing anything. If you have to pick up this game might as well wait for 2015. That's when most of the launch features a TCG should have wil be implemented. The game is barebones at the moment. It didn't launch with any kind of card recycler or revamped rewards system. The developers think that's fine, I find it a grind. Even something as basic as a tournement mode didn't make it into release. The truth is they're still on a player-to-player system and, you guessed it, serverside matchmaking won't be making it until the year after release, and dysincronizations and endless turns are still very much a reality. Current plans for IW 2015 make this feel like Beta Mk 2 not Ver 1.0.I'm out of room. Can't recommend.Revised Review 5/5/2014----So, I decided to give the game a more in-depth review at the behest of some of the developers. My main review is mostly still intact, so I'll detail where it changes and my new experiences with a month worth of play. Despite what Steam says it's over 40 hours (I dont' play with Steam in online mode a lot). Like I said before the game has potential that's almost all it's working on. I saw that patch .96 was live so if convention is to be believed it's very close to release, so I don't buy that, ""It's beta"" excuse everyone from the developers to the community likes to foist on you. It's way too close to a 1.0 version for that to be a sufficient. Still, if you're a person who like to play games based on the promise of what they might be (a la Dwarf Fortress or something). I'm not really going to convince you. I'm here to report on what exists. I can't critique things that don't exist. The AI is horrible (They've ""got plans""). I beat the most difficult AI routinely and draw it out if I'm lazy. I think I lost once to it because I wasn't paying attention. You can beat the AI with just about any deck you can put together. The campaign serves as less of a story and more as an extended tutorial to get you cards. The bugs and glitches are still pretty bad. At .96 you'd expect most of the core modes to be at least pretty solid, but Rift Run (there version of draft) didn't work right for about two weeks I was there. Every patch seemed to make the game worse. While they'd fix some things they'd introduce two issues for every issue they fixed. Some people tell me that's ""how development goes"" but I'll let you realize who paradoxical that is. Speaking more on the modes. Rift Run (again their Draft) is actually an exercise in how much money you're willing to pour into it (thankfully not real world money). At one-thousand Infinity Points (the free currency) it's actully quite cheap to at least make sure you have ideal commanders, cheapinging the spirit of the mode. The factions: The game is pretty strong, it still feels really random to me, but you learn a few tricks. It still does feel like you're throwing cards. One faction (their first post-core faction) is basically unplayable by itself and is generally in need of reowrking. It's been through one already. That gives me pause to invest in the next non-core release, Ascenscion.The only way to get free card packs after a while becomes leveling up. Which is fair. They don't have to give you free packs for everything. You get a few single cards for weekly quests and the fee card for your daily login and first three games of the day, which makes sure you get a card for participating, but the leveling up is purely geometric in scale (one more thousand exp to level up) in scale. You get one pack no matter how much it actually took to get to the next level. So the rewards remain the same while you're doing more work for the same thing. That naturally make leveling up a grind. If you're the kind of person who can do PVP all day long with no change then more power to you. If found the community by in large hostile if you didn't toe the general opinion. Any critique of the game is met with ""It's in beta' again remember they're at version .96, that's almost release, or it's met without outright nastiness, which I suppose is just the nature of the beast when you're dealing with anything over the internet. The inablity to take and evaluate criticism is only going to hurt the game in  the long run. They'll probably say bad things about me, but I don't really care. There are a few other small issues that give me pause to invest anymore time into the game. A sale was held on a deck recently. The sale was in LP (Lightmare Points the real-money currency) and not Infinity Points. I asked around and that wasn't something done before with both currencies being slashed for the sale. That smacks of riding the P2W line. So be careful if you do decide to adopt this game. All in all, I still cannot recommend this game. It's an okay TCG and it's probably the best F2P digital traiding card game I've played recently, but remember that the lesser of two evils is still evil. These are my opinions, but I did not enjoy the first time I played it, and I did not enjoy the month I spent for this review. There came a point where I wanted it to succeed, but if I'm going to play a game I don't want to feel like I'm just hitting my head against a wall, which is exactly what Infinity Wars feels like, except the wall has spikes. I'll be making a final review when it hits release. Though my expectations are markedly low.----While this game has a lot of potential it falls down in a few key areas one would expect a trading-card game to flourish in. Turn length is painfully long and busy, and their are far too many mechanics to keep in mind as you play. Including what order your creature cards are in and where they are on the zone. While the simultaneous turn mechanic might seem like it speeds up gameplay the uneeded general complexity of the game at large keeps it from being effective. Also, the simultaneous turn resolution (though there is initiative to keep in mind as well) gives the game a painfully random element beyond simple luck of the draw. It felt more like I was throwing cards at a brick wall and seeing wich ones took rather than leading an army in a grand strategic victory. Instead of skillful counters and repostes it feels more like you're constantly punching in the dark at one another. In this regard the mechanics of the game shine a light on a dominant strategy that shouldn't be so dominantly effective in this genre as to be the go-to strategy: The rush. Rush decks are the majoiry and the game tends to punish slightly slower than rush decks. It makes the game feel stale and samey. That being said collecting cards is fun, and the game does offer up many rewards. If you can get past the cumbersome mechanics progress feels nice. The cards are animated with looping gif-like pictures on each and every card which is pretty, but also fees gimicky. Battles aren't fought in any cenematic way. Cards bump into each other doing their damage. The factions are fairly distinct and the art is nice with shades of Warhammer 40K in a blend of sci-fi-coated fantasy. The game is in beta now, but as a representation of what we can expect it leaves a lot to be desired. The lovely if pointless card animations and promise of what are supposed to represent battlefield style engagements are marred by stilted and random mechanics. There are no doubt better card battle games one could be playing.			"

												Here is everything you need to know about this games free to play currency.If you play through the entire 7 tutorial levels, and then entire 10 other tutorial levels it refuses to also call tutorial levels, and the 64 campaign levels,.. and that was apparently 11 hous of  hours of play according to steam...... you do not have enough free currency to buy even one single standard sized 15 card booster pack. NOT.EVEN.ONE.Yeah sure you get cards for the campaign and ""levelling up"". That you can't trade. But walking out of the 11 hours of introductory campaign without enough currency for even one standard sized booster? Stingy. Very Stingy.			"

								I've given this game plenty of time to mature and balance itself out, but in the end I simply cannot recommend it to anyone. It's far too unbalanced, many of the mechanics are stripped from other TCGs, and some of the cards feel like they're nothing more than a cash grab (Star Trek).			"

								I wanted to like this game, I really did, but it turend out to be a huge dissapointment. The gamplay is clunky, with a poorly executed simultaneous turn system. This makes it extremely difficult to deduce what's going on. Turns conist of moving cards between an attack zone and a defense zone, then having the cards automatically attack things (as far as I know, you cannot prevent things from attacking, which sucks).  The interface is bad, not only in game but also in the deck edito/shop etc... Overall, a very dissapointing and not fun experience.			"

												At this time, I just cant give this game a thumbs up.  Between the account creation issues everyone is experiencing, and the actual gameplay itself..  it's just not worth it.First, the gameplay itself..  it's ok, but it's SERIOUSLY flawed.  The game has no built in ""counter"" system.  This is rather hard to explain, but the BEST way I can describe it is by telling people to imagine the old Super Nintendo Mario Kart vs a Friend.. the first one to get smacked by a power up... lost.  It's the same here.  The first player to plop out a stupid amount of 10/10+ creatures in rapid succession ... wins.  Period.  There's nothing  you can do about it.  Decks are 1 dimensional this way as well, as there is no point trying to get creative.. just create dozens of mega creatures (Which ANYONE can do... even with the worst possible deck.) and swarm the opponent.  Honestly, it's hard to describe properly unless you experience it for yourself.Now, in OTHER cardgames, the Matchmaking system will provide a check and balance to this..  not here.  First, you wait an average of 10+ minutes for a single game.. and then it  pairs you (just starting out..) against a guy who's spend $4-500 in cards.  You get smashed in 4 turns.. (about 3-5 minutes.) back into the que for another 10+ minutes.  Repeat.  In fact, in the 8 hours I have played.. I have not played a single other ""newbie"" player.  Just people with a bunch of gold medals, custom avatars, custom cardbacks, custom battlefields and decks full of Rare powerful cards.  It's INCREDIBLY frustrating, and basically forces you to flush MASSIVE amounts of money to compete.  (Which yes, of course, is a staple to any cardgame.. but here they practically wave a banner at you screaming ""BUY CARDS OR YOU'LL NEVER ENJOY THE GAME HAHAHAHAHA!)  The matchmaker woes continued for me as I played the SAME player 4 GAMES in a row.  ..  well.. it TRIED to anyways.. after he completely stomped me in 4 turns the first go round, I didnt waste my time on subsequent attempts, just immediately quit out.  This game, while cute for a VERY short time.. just isnt worth a long term investment.5/10			"

A polished card game that is lacking depthThis is more of an initial review, as i decided to try this game out as it looks great visually.This is how the game is played:Each card has a certain amount of points it needs to be played, and each turn you get one more point than the last turn. For most cards you have to wait until your next turn after playing it before you can place them on the ""battlefield"". So basically... you put down all the cards you can each turn, and then put them all in the attack zone, and then hope your units are stronger than whatever units your oppenent has.There is ""a little"" strategy as you can move your cards around so that someone with a large amount of hitpoints gets attacked first, or perhaps you can sacrifice someone with low hitpoints so that your stronger units take less damage.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So basically.... it's a game of ""who has stronger cards wins"" and it's very hard to recover if you start to fall behind...In a way it reminds me of old-yu-gi-oh, where you place all your cards in attack position and just overpower your opponent. However, in YuGiOh you at least have plenty of other cards that can counter this style of play, but this game feels a bit mindless. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Things I did like though:+ Animated Cards are a nice touch and bring cards to life+ Visually the game looks great in all aspectsThings I did not like:- Story is awful, and is very hard to follow what is happening- Voice Acting- Not enough depth in the card-game- Lots of Microtransactions everywhere you look(I did not play this game very long so take it with a grain of salt)			"

												Well, I don't recommend a game that you can't sign up for.The registration screen is bugged. Says it couldn't detect my country.  Nice of it to provide a region selection drop-down menu (A joke, it actually doesn't do that.)When I went to their main site, it kept telling me my birthdate was invalid.  Maybe that's because it has a standard text-entry box for the field?  Throughout my many years of using the internet, this is the only time I've ever seen such a hideous design.  It doesn't even tell you what format it wants!  I had to guess first with ""MM/DD/YYYY"", didn't take. ""DD/MM/YYYY"" Also was invalid.  ""<Month> DD YYYY"" Wasn't approved.I did Google this issue but all I was able to find were people asking why it was taking up to a half hour to process the account creation request.  I didn't even get that far, it wouldn't even take my info!Well done on having a completely ♥♥♥♥ed account creation system. If that is bugged, I can only imagine what else in the game is bugged. Will not be playing this game even if account creation is fixed.First impressions are everything and you only get one.  This company gave a terrible first impression.			"

												Will keep the review basic and since it's F2P, you can give it a go yourself to check whether the game suits you. This game is not very well balanced, more a Pay To Win, and I have played other games, like Magic The Gathering and Might & Magic: Duel of the Champions and there new player actually has some chances to win in PvP. This coupled with slow game look up process makes me want to switch to other games rather than spending time waiting for game to start only to get some experienced PVP opponent with deck that kills me in sometimes even less than game start waiting time (not sure if the player base is so small or whatelse..)Pros:- Nice graphic- Animated cards- Variety of cards and sides you can take on (each having it's own weaknesses and advantages)- Many campaigns (and you can get some free decks by doing them)- In-game challenges & achievements (who doesn't like them)- Background story- Rift Run - seems to be interesting concept. Played only once, but that seemed to be giving some chances to new players (considering you can pay the entry fee that is). It does make you draft your deck from random cards, so you don't have to have them yourself.Cons:- Slow PVP matchmaking - on average it takes couple of minutes to find a game. Not once, I was able to get myself some coffee or even eat something while waiting for game to start and when returning, it was still trying to lookup.- Bad matchmaking - in 9 out of 10 cases I have been playing opponents with lots of gold or higher medals on profile, meaning they did spend a looot of time in PVP (and the game) polishing their decks and getting lots of cards- Pay to win - some say you can get cards - sure, you can get. It's a slow process though and you have to play really a lot of games to get some. Mainly you get them by playing campaigns, and that's the easy part, but you don't get anything too fancy. Sure, you get also in-game money, but it trickles like from closed but leaking tap and again, play A LOT and you can eventually get few cards - still though, if you want to go PVP, you better consider spending some money to get better cards.- Still has bugs - didn't see anything major, more like a cosmetic and graphical mainly on claiming rewards where you may need to claim same twice or the interfaces are overlapping (reward claim interface with others)All in all, over Infinity Wars I would much more prefer for example Duel of Champions where matchmaking is way better and some seasonal player can actually get chances to win without spending real world money and get some fun rather than just waiting to be pwned. If you're only going to play Infinity Wars occassionally, then rather look for an alternative. "

Early Access Review
								It's no Magic: The Gathering, but Infinity Wars is a solid, free-to-play digital TCG. Being digital does allow Infinity Wars to do some pretty cool things that aren't possible with physical TCG's - like simultaneous turns and actively creating cards during gameplay. The simultaneous turn system adds an interesting, poker-esqe level of strategy. It allows you to guess, or force, your opponent's moves rather than simply react to them. There are several factions from which to build decks, but each faction seems so lazer-focused on a single mechanic that there is little room for building a ""unique"" deck. This will probably improve as cards are added over time, and it doesn't keep the game from being fun in the meantime.			"

												Best TCG game I have played.Despite that there's two minor flaws:1. It's a bit grindy, but it pretty much depends on luck as you have many ways to obtain cards it's jsut the fact you may not get the better ones fast.2. Playerbase, which is pretty small because this game is unknown for most people, not like Hearthstone, which is mainstream game and would have never been played by so much people if it wasn't created by Blizzard.

								It's no Magic: The Gathering, but Infinity Wars is a solid, free-to-play digital TCG. Being digital does allow Infinity Wars to do some pretty cool things that aren't possible with physical TCG's - like simultaneous turns and actively creating cards during gameplay. The simultaneous turn system adds an interesting, poker-esqe level of strategy. It allows you to guess, or force, your opponent's moves rather than simply react to them. There are several factions from which to build decks, but each faction seems so lazer-focused on a single mechanic that there is little room for building a ""unique"" deck. This will probably improve as cards are added over time, and it doesn't keep the game from being fun in the meantime.			"

												Time ago I was about to try the game, then I read the various negative reviews and disinstalled it before trying because they claimed it was a PTW and unplayable for new players, so I tried other tcg. I was an avid Hearthstone player and tried Hex and Magic. Well, after a while I tried anyway IW because I wanted to give it a try. Well, it was a blast. NOTHING of what those reviews said was true after trying the game. I don't know if they changed something, but it's just a week I play and I have 400+ cards just by playing the campaign and logging in.I receive free cards every day for logging and another for playing 3 games in any mode.Plus I can even sometime win against ranked veterans with just a week of playing under my hood. Granted there are great decks and players out there that can blast me away, but is more a matter of experience and missing maybe some card here and there.Plus there is the fact you can even play legendary free decks that they put up every week on rotation, and even if you don't have enough cards those decks are good and also train you to new strategies and combos and explain you new cards.So, don't let those old negative reviews discourage you, the game is completely playable FOR FREE, and you can become pretty competitive given a bit of time (not too much too!).The game is fun also, very interesting factions and strategies, different ways to win, a lot of sinergies and different decks variants.I played Hearthstone, Hex, magic and none stands up to IW.Try it for a week, then decide!

												One of the best out there with nearly unlimited deck building options, and most importantly a good player base that never takes more than a few seconds to grab a live match. AI is pretty good for Easy mode even if its kinda derpy at times. Can't wait to see the harder modes unlocked. Already some skill out there too, good players and new alike, matchmaking seems to be good too. Campaigns and leveling gives all kinds of booster packs as you progress so free to play is certainly true. Though (as with most all tcg) you can pay your way to a better deck it really doesn't do more than give you a head start as all cards are freely obtainable (all level reward packs are random boosters), and having a bunch of good cards will never guarantee victory with this game. True TCG where tactics reign. Good luck to any wanting to try it out, don't wait its definitely worth it.			"

												A Wonderful Card game. Recently a friend and I were reminiscing in all the old card games we used to play. So we decided we wanted to play a new trade card game but we didn't have much luck on finding any old games online such as Yu-Gi-Oh and other card games we grew up playing. So I decided to search on steam and found this game. The game is great but there a few connection bugs I have come across in my time playing. The campaign was really fun and was a great way to do a tutorial. After playing through the campaign/campaigns I knew exactly how to play and how I wanted to play. I would like the campaign to be added onto however. There was not  much backstory on the factions and I would love to induldge into their lore/history.The game is fairly simple, there is a defending side and an attacking side. Place you cards in either zone to try to win. However it's not always a case of whoever has the stronger cards wins. I mainly use Verore characters and my friend mainly uses the zombie ones (I forget the name at this time). He gets his power from reviving dead cards. I get my power by killing his cards. We cancel each other out and have lost track of time in one game. Yesterday we started a game at 1:00AM and  finished at 3:00 AMI definetly recommed this game to anyone who likes TCG, or are looking to bring back the fun they had when they were younger with TCGs.

												I like Infinity Wars, I really do, but this is the closest to a non-recommendation as you're going to get. Keep that in mind.Cards are great, design is great, gameplay is great, and there's a lot of single-player content, which is great.The problem is multi-player. Maybe it's my connection, which is admittedly very bad, but I cannt play anything multi-player. I don't know if there are not that many other players or what. I just sit and wait in queue. At some point, I'd really like to test my decks against others, and I can't do that. I'm not even that big into the competitive portion of games like this and, like I said, there's a ton of single-player stuff.Anyway, I really like this game, but just know that there's a possibility you won't be able to play multi-player.

								Putting a fresh spin on card games in a digital format is difficult.  Getting beyond the set standards and being successful in a genre that has been dominated by a single entity for years even more so.  But what Infinity Wars does great isn't beating anyone, but offering a new, fresh perspective in a universe filled with enough lore to write a full book series.  The stories of the factions are rich, they each have their own unique play style, and game mechanics offer a new look at card game strategy that you wouldn't see anywhere else.  This may just be a beta, but I constantly find myself saying ""One more game"" far beyond the point that I should have gone to bed.  A truly amazing experience, and definitely a highly recommended one.			"

So many don't like the ""Pay to win"" fact, even though you can buy everything in game with in game cash, or with real money, it's totally optional and the fact that cards are RANDOM and in PACKS. Other game modes allow a fair advantage, ie merged, thats a great game to play when you're just starting out. you get to learn about the cards and new tactics, what works well together, what doesnt as well as having a mor eeven playing field, no pun intended.

It is not a MTG clone , nor a clone of TCGs / CCGs you might find elsewhere on Itunes store or android. Infinity wars has an unique battle system where you have several zones that must be used in harmony: attack zone , defence zone , support zone and commander zone ( kinda like the commander in MTG commander style , but a bit different ). I highly recommend for everyone that loves card games to check this one out !

								Putting a fresh spin on card games in a digital format is difficult.  Getting beyond the set standards and being successful in a genre that has been dominated by a single entity for years even more so.  But what Infinity Wars does great isn't beating anyone, but offering a new, fresh perspective in a universe filled with enough lore to write a full book series.  The stories of the factions are rich, they each have their own unique play style, and game mechanics offer a new look at card game strategy that you wouldn't see anywhere else.  This may just be a beta, but I constantly find myself saying ""One more game"" far beyond the point that I should have gone to bed.  A truly amazing experience, and definitely a highly recommended one.			"

								This the future of TCGs, A trading card game that is able to bring new elements never seen before on other carg games. It is not a MTG clone , nor a clone of TCGs / CCGs you might find elsewhere on Itunes store or android. Infinity wars has an unique battle system where you have several zones that must be used in harmony: attack zone , defence zone , support zone and commander zone ( kinda like the commander in MTG commander style , but a bit different ). I highly recommend for everyone that loves card games to check this one out !  Despite it being still be a beta and be a game by a small team IW is unique and already very playble and enjoyable ! ! !  "

												UPDATED: Finally a game with new mechanics in gameplay and in f2p system, you can obtain almost everything without paying a single cent, those paid upgrades are obtainable also with playing and for those card u can't find into boosters can be traded with other players for other cards. remembere that it's still in beta and the game need some polishing in the code, and extra cards, game modes and features will be added in the future patch by patch  very often (auction house, cube draft, two headed giants)AGGIORNATO: Gioco con meccaniche MOLTO innovative sia a livello di gameplay che di f2p, potete tranquillamente ottenere tutto senza pagare, le migliorie sono prettamente estetiche, gran parte delle quali comunque ottenibili anche giocando gratuitamente, ciò che avrete difficoltà ad ottenere per i vostri deck potrà essere comunque scambiato. ricordate che il gioco è ancora una beta e ha bisogno di alcune rifiniture nel codice, ulteriori carte, modalità di gioco e feature saranno aggiunte in futuro patch dopo patch con una cadenza veramente straordinaria (casa d'aste, cube draft, two headed giants)			"

								If you're into ATCG's, then you'll love Infinity Wars! It has a a small learning curve which is great for newcomers,  and overall is very balanced! The game is still in beta, and therefore has slight matchmaking issues and other network bugs, but it still makes for a great game. The tutorial is very short and fluid, so you'll be diving into the core game very quickly. Also, once you start leveling and opening booster packs, you won't be able to stop! Also- Microtransactions. Yes, they are present, but they aren't even close to the gamebreaking micro transactions that EA and King put out. They merely offer cosmetic changes, as well as a faster way to purchase more booster packs/decks (which are already available through the game's in-game cash). Infinity Wars will also have a mobile game dropping later this year for Android and iOS devices, be it a phone OR a tablet! With the few minor matchmaking glitches and bugs, this game still deserves an easy 8/10!			"

								First I'll start with the good qualities of the game.It's a fairly easy game to pick up and very easy to construct a deck to play with. 40 cards is the minimum.You get to choose 3 commanders - these are creature cards that start in a special section of the board called commanders and their abilites can be used at the offset but if you want them in battle you still have to pay the cast cost to get them out. It's fairly easy to get booster packs without actually having to pay anything. All you have to do is complete achievements and earn the ingame currency. Since you earn every time you win a battle (you earn in PVP even if you lose) it is easy to just keep buying boosters until you get the cards you want.The bad side?There are some bugs that prevent a game from completing (rarely).The matchmaking can be a little daunting but I think this may be because of the lack of players.All up, a great card game that is an enjoyable alternative to MTG with some surprises.

								Infinity Wars is a ""trading card"" game much like Magic where players face off against each other using creatures, abilities and strategy to bring down either a player's morale or fortress strength. With many gameplay options including campaign and PvP you can be playing for hours on end without realising it. With each achievement and level up you are rewarded with a random booster pack of cards which can be used to build your own deck combinations. However, PvP can be somewhat unfair with a chance of your first game being against someone at ANY level for example a level 20 vs a level 5. I would recommend Infinity Wars to people who like trading card games and don't care too much about being pitted against someone 2, 3 maybe even 4 times your level.			"

								Infinity Wars (IW) - is a great dCCG! I found it quite innovative in comparison to more traditional collectiable card games (such as Magic The Gathering, HEX, Shadow Era and others). In addition to different strategies thinking it also makes you think of bluffing and assuming your opponents moves in planning phase as a turn actions then resolve simultaneously. It's easier to see how it plays or try it by yourself then to describe it!A great art, animated cards makes this game highly enjoyable!Also a lot of game modes available: Academy (which learns you the basics and more advanced rules of the game), campaign (8 missions per each faction) rewarding you with starter decks and even more cards, AI battles and different PVP modes, quest system also rewards you for your in game progress!Though IW still in beta, the game is still under constant development and sometimes some bugs could occur and some issues in the game could be noticed (For me the UI should be more user friendly for example). But I am sure it will become better and better.Really waiting this game to be released for mobile devices (iOS, Android) so could play it when not at home.As a conclusion, this title has a great potential and I could recommend it for every TCG player.

After awhile it gets a bit repetive.You don't really need to buy cards to get a good deck but if you want to try various decks then there's no getting around buying more cards. The game still has some balance issues with decks and not all decks are created equalYou can trade cards in the game which is awesome.Overall it's a decent card game and cards are animated which visually is very appealing.

												I find this game very fast fun with very interesting decisions to make durring play and deck building. You can assign 3 cards as  your commander which determine your faction. You can assign commanders with a focus on using there utility, or intending to deploy them as threats. 8 factions allow 512 different faction combinations. Picking more factions allow for a increased varity of the card pool but picking the same faction multiple times allows you to get cards to focus more heavily on a factoins tactic.Durring play you have to position your characters accordingling in the correct order to best combat what you predict the oppoment will do. Positioning wrong can result in you just throwing your characters			"

												I have to say, this game is genius. It manages to utilise the digital medium to a large extent to do what physical card games cannot, such as simultaneous turns. Game balance is pretty good as well.The game is not pay-to-win, given the large amount of ways one can earn the in-game currency, and the amount of free card drops they give. Additionally, the quality of a card does not scale with rarity; you could win as easily with a deck made without Epics and Legendaries, as a deck filled with them.Instead of a crafting system, it has a trading system, which in some ways is better than the former. The majority of the community is quite friendly, so feel free to ask if anyone has any spare cards willing to donate.The 2 main issues are the tendency for bugs to pop up now and then, although the devs are working harder in preventing the game from becoming unplayable, and the relatively small player base, because unfortunately Hearthstone came out at around the same time, and Lightmare didnt do much marketing.

												I love the unique style. I hate how unbalanced everything is. Also why am I, a rookie, getting a mission to win a couple draft battles when I can't even win casual battles? I'm not even level twenty.But aside from that I do have a complaint. Why can't I get rid of these extra soulbound cards? And why is the last sleeper only 2 to play?And a bug was bugging me. I got the card that reveals my oponent's hand. But it won't let me zoom in on any of the cards but unlimited ones. Is that suppose to happen? Please help!!!			"

												Just want to say that the game is really nice exept it has a slight pay to win feeling. And if you say no its not let me explain.I know you can get the same cards for free but if somone pays for the packs and decks they open more and more chance of getting better cards on the same level than a free player. Almost same level player had 3!!! mega unit 02s and he deployes them in a work around method instead of paying the 13 res in his pack not to mention agent coyle and so on and i have been trying to get those cards for 100hrs of play and no luck. Yeah i managed to win once with a really lucky calamity call but thats it. Pure luck helped only.			"

								Compairing this to Yugioh or Magic or Toontown trading cards, it's an alright card game. When I was at a con recently I saw yugioh players. It was a 14 playing against a 47 year old. Both of them watch the show as a kid and enjoyed it. I tried playing yugiho but my mind wasn't sharp enough. The two players went home that night, even though they just met. I was able to obtain a deck of my own. But later I mixed my Yugi stuff with my nazi stuff resulting in an honorable sacrafice to the god John Wood. I decided to play this game because of how digital it is. After 2 games, I was MLG and got a triple kill. I got on an MLG team and are first game is tonight in an alley on main street. Hope I win.

												This is an excellent trading card game.  The free-to-play works well; I've been tempted to buy cards, but I can play Draft as much as I like without spending money, and there are other modes (Merged and Pauper) that exist to help newbies be competitive without having great cards.  I win reasonably often in the unrestricted mode, especially now that I've completed the (rather enjoyable) single-player campaign.If you've ever enjoyed a trading card game, you should try Infinity Wars.

												This is the best online Free to play Trading card game you will ever find, sure theres hearthstone but its not a TCG. This is a TCG and its very fun in my opinion. The animated cards is a really nice feature which I have never see before in multiplayer card games. But beside that the card types and  desgin of the game is very unique, which I enjoy very much. The only downside is the campagin which I thought was a bit boring it could use cutscenes. I still recommend this game to all gamers who enjoy TCGs. This game is a bit underated though sadly so it may be hard for you to find anyone to verus online. Still a great game though :)			"

												This game mixes a lot of the card games together. Other people have done well giving a good overview so I'm skipping that. ;)  It's a fun card game to play, the in game currency like any other game of it's type is difficult to obtain so expect to be playing for a week to buy something but I've found the default cards you win are enough to make clever decks. All in all I would give it 9/10 it loses 1 point for shortness of PVE content. It could be expanded there 10x over and make it a much better experience imo. But the PVE aspect does what it's intended to do, introducing you to the game.			"

I like this approach, it's really fun! You have to try and read your opponent, or just go head on, it's up to you!Cards are well balanced, and each card has a use, this is something I rarely see in TCGs, most TCGs have great cards that everyone plays, and dirt.9.8/10			"

												As i now have about 300+ Hours on this, I'd Like to explain why.This is the most Balanced card game I've ever seen. It has an incredably Smart resource system: you start with 1, gain 1 per turn until 10, and spend 9 to increase it by one, or use a character card who affects are only active until they die.Cards have different abilitys, such as charge, vigulance, haste, and meny others. But the Main one is Flying. Flying characters, unless defending, cand only be blocked be other flying characters or characters with reach.A deck has 3 commanders, Each belonging to a Faction with a certain purity (Single, Double, Triple, Dual (2 Factions) and Hybrid (Either of two factions)) of that faction. Each deck, as you may guess, has 3 puritys, and they all can be the same faction or 3 different factions. A deck can only have cards of the Commander's Purity. And Each faction has it own benifits and downsides. Also, Each faction has an unlimited Card (A card that you can have unlimitly in a deck.) Now to talk about them:1. Warpath: Coming from the untamed world, they are mostly made up of various creatures of the wild. It was a natural Ecosystem watched over by the Immortal Aleta, One of the two humans left after the calamity, until the rifts opened and Atlas and the Flame Dawn Came and Started ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. So they were forced it Fight Together against them, and the other factions that come through, Espesialy the Sleepers.Warpath is a Late-Game Faction, it's cards cost lots of resources, but are also very powerful. They're very good at taking out flying units. The unlimited character of this faction is the one of many, a wolf/lion thing.2. Genesis Industrys: Hailing from Talich, the same realm as the Flame Dawn, they are Very Technologicaly Advanced, And have Robots do most of the fighting and work. It was an Ally of the Flame dawn in their conquest of Talich, until they turned on them. They fought until the rift to the untamed world opened. Then they teamed up again to fight the Warpath and then the Sleepers. Then the Overseers Came along and intended to destroy all traces of the sleepers, including anyone who was infected. Genesis didnt want their infected slaghtered, but the Flame Dawn Teamed up with the Overseers, and now they're fighting both forces.Genesis is a build up faction. It has lots of varying cards of Cost and strength, but canpower up any card to be more powerful. Has lots of weak flying units. The unlimited character of this faction is the Unending Drone.3. Venore:-Will Add more when I have time. "

												This and Solforge are probably the two best collectible card games out there. Having simultanous turns is a sweet concept that is executed very well and leads to a lot of interesting decisions and mind games. Lots of potential there. It's free to play and the initial campaign is short, so giving the game a try is a good idea. During the campaign you already earn a good amount of cards that go towards various starter decks, jumping off from there is easy.			"

								Infinity Wars is my first trading card game and also my first free to play game on Steam. If you are new to either of these type of games then this game makes a good start.The game is not to complicated however some cards can be a little cryptic to understand. But with a little experience you will understand what they actually do quickly.The game board graphics are very simple but do look good. I have noticed that when using a location card, sometimes your other cards do get concealed by the graphics of your location on the board. I am sure this is just a bug and will be fixed by the time the game is out of it BETA phase. The illustration graphic of the animated cards are specially good. Of course some are better than others.The sound in the game, again is very simple but OK. This is a game were sound is not important. I play with the sound off not because it is bad, I just don't require it in the game. The sound effects do not effect the game play what so ever.Now for the free to play issue. It is possible to play this game without paying a penny however you will need patience. There are many opportunity to collect cards in game without buying them. There are many rewards for completing campaign stages and there is a daily and 3/4 day challenges to increase your card collection. There is also in game credit system to accumulate as you play to buy more cards. I have manage to get quite far by just buying the starter deck which is advised but not essential and one pre-ordered Infestation deck.This card game makes a good side game to play while playing other games. If you do decide to go hardcore on this game then like any other free to play games it become a pay to win game and can get expensive. I don't find this game addictive but it is enjoyable to play for a good few rounds.			"

								Typical card game. Nicely executed, several races with limited possibilities to mix. Free to play at least for single player campaigns. Free to play multiplayer although I don't know if the free starter deck will stand up long enough to climb any rankings. Give it a try if you like card games.			"

												This game mixes a lot of the card games together. Other people have done well giving a good overview so I'm skipping that. ;)  It's a fun card game to play, the in game currency like any other game of it's type is difficult to obtain so expect to be playing for a week to buy something but I've found the default cards you win are enough to make clever decks. All in all I would give it 9/10 it loses 1 point for shortness of PVE content. It could be expanded there 10x over and make it a much better experience imo. But the PVE aspect does what it's intended to do, introducing you to the game.			"

												Definite recommendation! The game is really fun, casualy and competitevely!The twist of this card game is that everything is happening simultaneously, you decide what's gonna happen, and when both players hit ""Ready"", it resolves. I like this approach, it's really fun! You have to try and read your opponent, or just go head on, it's up to you!Cards are well balanced, and each card has a use, this is something I rarely see in TCGs, most TCGs have great cards that everyone plays, and dirt.9.8/10			"

												As i now have about 300+ Hours on this, I'd Like to explain why.This is the most Balanced card game I've ever seen. It has an incredably Smart resource system: you start with 1, gain 1 per turn until 10, and spend 9 to increase it by one, or use a character card who affects are only active until they die.Cards have different abilitys, such as charge, vigulance, haste, and meny others. But the Main one is Flying. Flying characters, unless defending, cand only be blocked be other flying characters or characters with reach.A deck has 3 commanders, Each belonging to a Faction with a certain purity (Single, Double, Triple, Dual (2 Factions) and Hybrid (Either of two factions)) of that faction. Each deck, as you may guess, has 3 puritys, and they all can be the same faction or 3 different factions. A deck can only have cards of the Commander's Purity. And Each faction has it own benifits and downsides. Also, Each faction has an unlimited Card (A card that you can have unlimitly in a deck.) Now to talk about them:1. Warpath: Coming from the untamed world, they are mostly made up of various creatures of the wild. It was a natural Ecosystem watched over by the Immortal Aleta, One of the two humans left after the calamity, until the rifts opened and Atlas and the Flame Dawn Came and Started ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. So they were forced it Fight Together against them, and the other factions that come through, Espesialy the Sleepers.Warpath is a Late-Game Faction, it's cards cost lots of resources, but are also very powerful. They're very good at taking out flying units. The unlimited character of this faction is the one of many, a wolf/lion thing.2. Genesis Industrys: Hailing from Talich, the same realm as the Flame Dawn, they are Very Technologicaly Advanced, And have Robots do most of the fighting and work. It was an Ally of the Flame dawn in their conquest of Talich, until they turned on them. They fought until the rift to the untamed world opened. Then they teamed up again to fight the Warpath and then the Sleepers. Then the Overseers Came along and intended to destroy all traces of the sleepers, including anyone who was infected. Genesis didnt want their infected slaghtered, but the Flame Dawn Teamed up with the Overseers, and now they're fighting both forces.Genesis is a build up faction. It has lots of varying cards of Cost and strength, but canpower up any card to be more powerful. Has lots of weak flying units. The unlimited character of this faction is the Unending Drone.3. Venore:-Will Add more when I have time. "

												This and Solforge are probably the two best collectible card games out there. Having simultanous turns is a sweet concept that is executed very well and leads to a lot of interesting decisions and mind games. Lots of potential there. It's free to play and the initial campaign is short, so giving the game a try is a good idea. During the campaign you already earn a good amount of cards that go towards various starter decks, jumping off from there is easy.			"

												Basic TCG, but can shift cards between defense and offense -- two battle fields.  Cards that would have ""summoning sickness"" go to support field and can only be attacked by spells or other special cards.  They can stay there, ramping up based on other events (other games accomplish this with stealth cards, but in this case, it applies to all cards).Also dividing field between support and offense is a good way to visualize ""summoning sickness.""  Didn't play very far, but interesting as far as I got.  Out of courtesy to developer, rating up.			"

												The game is just a blast.  Factions are balanced and the card animations are a mildly entertaining Gimmick.   If you're a CCG player, you'll have a blast with this game.Summary:  Game is fun, there's a good number of different rulesets, and the cards/abilities are different from other card games I've played.Pros:--A refreshing challenge for a CCG (collectible card game) vet.--Balanced play, a fair system of resource generation that doesn't feel pay-to-win (which is surprising considering most other card games are totally P2W when you think about it).--Earning points is slow if you're not buying points, but it feels REALLY good to unlock a deck you earned.--Varied Game types that aren't locked at any level, but may take time to build up to.--Random shuffle programming they use is more random than fricking Magic The Gathering 2014.--I loved the mix deck matches when I started because it shuffles both your decks together.  So you get to play with their more varied cards and your own (also, it requires more thinking on your feet with the cards you get).--Constructed deck matches are really interesting too.  I suggest looking it up on youtube or try it after you download the game (practice mode).Cons:--Some people quit when they start to lose, but they quit by dodging rather than concedeing.   You still get the win and they still get the loss, but you have to wait 1 minute because it treats the quit like a disconnect.  Can be annoying.--It can be frustrating playing ranked matches because people frequently try to bum-rush you with death by speed rather than have a fun / drawn out game.   Just prepare yourself to fight for your life in the first 8 turns.--Finding a late night match tends to pit you against some crazy pros in the game.			"

								The game is definitely fun and has some good mechanics going for it, but digital ccg developers have a really ridiculous antiquated view on pricing structures. It's a good game, it's just not worth spending the type of money they want for it. I've read the asinine rebuttal from the developers on the forums about how people are just getting sticker shocked because the game doesn't have all the rewards in place.No. That's not it. It's that when someone makes a CCG, they somehow think that there's a standard and acceptable pricing structure and that they should be able to get people to pay like people have paid for MTG/Pokemon/Yugioh. Sorry, you're not those games, the only reason those games can even charge what they do is because they've been around for ages.So, while this game is good and I highly recommend a play through of the campaigns and running some drafts with the free currency, this game does not understand opportunity cost. $50 for 20 packs when there's 3 sets - You can buy multiple full games for that amount, why spend that money on a handful of cards, getting duplicates, not having the cards to play what you want to play, and then playing with your lame deck using their terrible matchmaking which pits you against people who are way ahead of you in terms of card collection.

												This is what Free to Play should be!  10/10To many, Free to Play games are a nasty affair.  Constantly forcing you to pay to keep playing, or wait for a timer.  Maybe making it nearly impossible to get anywhere without spending your money on single use macguffins.  Or worst of all, locking large portions of gameplay behind the dreaded pay wall.  Infinity Wars does none of those things!  Sure you can drop some cash to unlock some cosmetic options, or decks of cards, or booster packs.  But you never feel like you HAVE to, and for the most part, you can earn enough in-game currency to purchase them through normal gameplay.The team at Lightmare do it right.  Regular patches, content add ons, and updates, all without nickle and dimeing you every step of the way.  Along with a dedicated community, all working together to make Infinity Wars the best it can be.  What's not to love?			"

The devs are working overtime to fix/tweak out all the bugs, but in its current state (V1.2 at time of writing) it still as buggy as a beta. Bugs i've personally encountered include: UI glitches, card status glitches, and achevment counters activating and awarding bonuses before they are complete.

												This is a fantastic deck building and card battle game.  The campaign is quite long and contains unique battle setups, decks, and comes with a little bit of story.  It has a great tutorial and a selection of puzzle battles to test your understanding of the game.  PVP modes include standard deck battles and a deck random draft mode where you play until you get 3 losses.  After finishing the campaign, training, and leveling up to 9 I had enough card to build a few decks.  You can earn enough cards to at least mess around with friends just by playing the game.  It feels like a supremely fair and respectable free-to-play model.			"

												an ok game would have been great but there is just too much broken in it. 2 of the three new expansion factions are broken and you might as well quit out of thoise games straight away (angels and undead). thankfully only about a quarter of players use those decks. another quarter of the games you're just going to get unlucky and play against someone whos deck is coincidentally built to your weakness so you'll lose those as well unless you get lucky. (you cant get lucky against the broken factions.)the remaining half of games are enjoyable and fun.			"

												A good, deep, tactical card game,Not really a trading card game thoughTL:DR - I like it, worth playing, but a pretty stiff learning curve once you play vs. others.the long-  it's difficult, I'm at 60 hours about, and level 13I have with a little grinding, getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked, some incredible♥♥♥♥♥kicking actually under 10 turn losses.BUTI now have a few decent decks, I did pay about 3 us dollars to get some more cards.But even so I have honestly made my winning decks through playing.When I first started playing the matchmaker was pretty broken, I think it was because there were not always newer players on all the time, I used to get matched to real terryifying opponents early on.I stuck it out thoughNow I feel that I feel comfortable with the matchmaking, it has improved a great deal.New rewards systems, that give boosts, and card packs just for logging in and playing daily.I think it will help get some fresh blood into the scene, The games mechanics are deep, and each race/deck can be customized, mixed, or take on a wide range of play styles.Aggro, Defensive, Juggernauts, Boost, magic...+++, all different play styles are here, Players really weild some wild, and effective decks using all manner of dirty rotten wish I'd thought of that kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥The animated card backs also add a nice punch, the art style is original, and I really enjoy the musicFor a casual player this game may not be for them, hearthstone is more forgiving and easier to play(the only other TCG game i'd really played on pc)Infity wars is good, even great has its problems, but for a free game, thats honestly free I love it.Hands down worth learning and playing.Its filled a big gap in my travel/down time "

								Infinity Wars is a really good game if you like unbalanced unpredictable game play. I do like this game and I give it seven rubber chickens out of ten. Though I dont think I will be playing for much longer.Its way to easy of a player to spam one thing and troll. Now its not the loosing that bothers me when this happens but rather just having to sit there and watch it. I think there should have been a duplicate card limit, and a card ability limit.That combo makes for some very fustrating games. There is no skill in wining that way, If im going to loose I want the match to be well played.Overall, I still do recomend this game. But personaly for me I will wait a while before spending money, Im not convince on the replayability yet.			"

												By far the best TCG I've played in years, Infinity Wars brings something to the table that many other card games fail to deliver on. It has an interesting universe it plays in, it's well balanced and most importantly, it's fun.The game is a mix of different elements you've seen from various other TCGs, it has factions akin to Magic, but it plays out uniquely, the resource system is very much like Hearthstone, however I believe this was a decision consciously made before development, and not copied from Hearthstone, like in many other games.I'm not going to go into detail about much of how the game plays, as you can find that out faster by yourself, but just know that this game does have it's fair share of bugs at the moment, none of which are game breaking, but they do impact some of your games. On the same note I'd like to address that the devs know about this, and are hard at work when it comes to fixing these. Many have already been fixed over the years, it's only a matter of time until they get the rest.Essentially, if you want a unique TCG experience unlike anything you've ever played, give this game a try.

								For those looking for a good online trading card game, this might be it, BUT NOT YET.  The game currently has a crippling desynchronization bug with no fix in sight ('being worked on'), that happens as frequently as every other game and is widespread (both constructed and paid drafts). I would advise anyone to try it and make sure stability issues are worked out before putting any real money in.The free campaign gives you decks in each faction. quests and a daily login bonus, but all completely NON tradable. So if you are looking just to casually play without putting money or trading with decks that'll get beaten by anyone, you'll do fine.There's a pretty nifty 'merged deck' feature that combines your opponent's deck with yours with two results: it gives you access to any of their unbalanced cards but it blows any synergy you have as you will now get your draws 50% less than you would normally.As far as free to play:  You can earn a 15 card pack with one rare in about 50 games played, with currently no daily cap.  Those cards are tradable, which leads to another big issue.  The game ACTIVELY encourages third party sites for selling cards, and people have been in for many, many months.  It's very easy to buy a deck that you'll have no chance against from those sites (and if there is any sort of ELO for non-ranked, I haven't seen it).The arena version ('rifts') has a no pay alternative which has no rewards, which is great for beginners.  You can literally just practice drafting and not play, over and over again which is definitely unique and new-user friendly (and no desyncs).  However, the competive draft, while being low on cost, suffers from the crippling desyncs mentioned above.  So in the middle of a game that you're winning, you'll think your opponent is slow, and then time ends and the turns don't go, another loss.The production values are top notch, and it's certainly more complex (in a good way) than some other card games, but the complexity ultimately boils down to 'Did I swap between my attackers and defenders while my opponent did not' sort of thing. The factions have not been balanced yet.All in all, I'd wait a while until things are stable before putting any money in. "

												I think people are very upset because they don't accept losing. They can't fathom the fact that they spent hours, if not days, planning their starter decks with a few boosters for the perfect play and still lose. (Read the most helpful review, the dude lost because his opponent outplayed him so he posted a Negative review lmao!)I've not once ever seen a paper TCG/CCG that you can't get s**t on for playing basic, common, starter-deck, builds. All the way from Magic to Yugioh to Pokemon. If you didn't expand your deck and you build strategies, people will take advantage of that and beat you. Starter decks are literally what they say, it's just that start. They aren't meant to be the most optimal decks straight from that bat that beats everything else with a few clever moves. Building successful paper decks have always taken a great amount of time, energy, and sometimes even money. People love to be hand-held through every game now a days. They rely on streamers and youtube to actually enjoy a game, but they have no idea how much fun everything was when none of that stuff existed and you had to travel out of your computer seat and search for those NEW cards. Sometimes even get in your car and drive for an hour to a tournament to see those cards you've never heard of before because your friends or yourself have never picked them up from boosters. It was all part of the adventure and charm of these games.I truly do enjoy the game even when I get my butt handed to me because it's a learning experience. Each time I lose to an opponent, I learn how to counter them a little bit better. I learn the pacing and when I finally do get those cards I want/need, I will have everything in my wits to beat them and man is it rewarding as heck when you do.			"

												Summary: Very clunky and unintuative. Might be good, might not be,  but I could not figure out enough to find out.Review: Really unimpressed. I saw that the game had pretty much all good reviews, so I decided to try it, even though I don't generally like this kind of game.Played the first couple of missions. REALLY boring stuff. I imagine that it's only the tutorial, but still. At this point I got a couple of packs. I was like ok... now it gets interesting. So I went to go make a deck. This is where I got really disillusioned. I could not make heads or tails of the deck making area. One or two of the factions available seemed to have thier icons off the side of my screen. The game showed me every card in the game whether I owned it or not in a scrolling view that made it hard to find even one card that I owned. I could not figure out the rules for deck building...I finally realized that there was a box I needed to click next to the statement that said Hide unknown cards. The box was really hard to see so I had not been able to find that previously. Took me a while. I figured out that I don't have enough cards to make a deck. So I tried to get back to the map to play some more boring missions... I could not figure out how to get to the map however...Maybe I'm dense... but the game seems incredibly unintuative and clunky for new players. It may be a good game... though the first two missions of the tutorial were very boring indeed. Not much to judge a game on. Normally I would go farther before judging a game... but in this game I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do much of anything. Spent around an hour so far... just can't figure much out. Not the way to attract new players.PS. Ok... now I found the campaign map, so I go to it and my only option is to go back to the main menu screen. Maybe because I messed with my deck? Not sure. But since I don't know how to make a deck I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I'd eventually figure it out, but I doubt I'll stick around to find out.How this game got so many good reviews is hard to figure. Must be pretty good once you figure it out. But unless everyone on steam is much smarter than I am this game will never retain its new players, as I simply could not figure it out.			"

												I don't understand how all these reviews do not label the game as Pay-2-Win.Don't be mistaken, this game is absolutely pay-to-win, and worst off, its pay-to-win in a game with a playerbase in the hundreds.  If you spend money on booster/decks/singles, you will have an advantage over non-paying players.  That is pay-to-win in my book.  Granted, it isn't pay-to-play.  There are ways for non-paying players to earn packs (5250 IP for a pack, you gain 150 IP per 5 minute win, 75 for a 5 minute loss.  That means anywhere between 30-40 games for 15 cards.  Did I also mention that there are 9 factions (colors/classes)?  So yeah, good luck building a deck in a short amount of time without spending money.I would have enjoyed this game a lot more if it were still Early Access, but this game has been out for 2+ years and still has many problems.Card interactions are buggy and the text isn't standardized across cards.  Morale values are not balanced, and card costs/purities aren't balanced either.  Many games end because of bugs or because it is just a death race or a coin flip.  There is some strategy there, but the results often boil down to luck because of the simultaneous turns.  You'll find yourself in draws very often.There are also so many board wipes, its ridiculous.  Wrath of God/Armageddon used to mean something, but in IW prepare for Mass Death, Heat Wave, Yuanshi's Wrath, The Calamity, Shikana, MU, the list goes on.  There are many many cards capable of clearing the board of all creatures, and many decks built around those cards.Low playerbase, no matchmaking system, so newbies are forced to play against pros, wasting their currency (it costs 1000 IP to enter a draft -- if you lose 3 games you're out).  There are separate queues for ranked/unranked but its meaningless because you don't get anything for playing ranked.  The only reason to play unranked is for the EXP and the only reason to get EXP is for the cards (assuming you're non-paying).  So you have to grind this treadmill for weeks just to be able to play the game in a meaningful way if you don't want to pay money to a game that is basically still in beta, but released for the public.TL;DR:Just another Pay-2-Win card game with lower playerbase than other games and worse player incentives.  The reward structure will make you scratch your head, as the game itself is a bit of fun, but the MMO treadmill they expect us to run is ridiculous.			"

												magic the gathering part duex?  Might as well be, not a bad game, but if you're already established in MTG no real point in this game, and finding games takes a very long time.Not a bad game, by any means, far more strategy than MtG, you play turns at the same time, which coming from alternating turn games can be a little confusing, just have to get used to it.  Could this game be fun yes, but I woefully outgunned from the get go, I believe I won 1 pvp match so far and that was sheer luck I think, just getting beat down by uber cards while my suck.I didn't like that they basically just took all of Mtg ideas and made them their own, at least call the stuff something different, but I suppose that was on purpose so people who play mtg can get into the game right away.  I just don't see myself starting over with anohter game and grinding my way back up, if this game would have come out first, I'd be playing this instead.Also their UI is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, you can't find♥♥♥♥♥♥on it, it's a big jumbled up mess.  It's like a kid on crack just threw all their favorite links on the front page.			"

												The game is prety much ok, its only game i find with this mechanics. I spended 30 $ on 2 DLCs and i dont regret it till now.  The only bad thing is the new company. They do not know how to advertise the game properly, and they already ruined the game with some usless op cards. The game is good, and il stay here til hes dead forever, but i dont recomend it for new players. Dont look at how many hours i have on this acount, i have somewhere to 3 years in this game. Pros: -Every card is animated.-Simultaneously turns make the require some think.-Tons of cards and more factions.-You can combine factions to make youre own deck.Cons:-0 Fariplay, as a new player you get to play even vs #1 on the leaderbords, so no skill lvl matchmaking.-Matchmaking seems rigled. No matter what deck i play enemy has always the deck who exactly counter me/-Huge long ques times, i waited even 15 min for a match.-Client and game are bugged, constantly crashes, frezzings, you lose games of the desync etc.-Draft is bugged. -Profile is usless. You cant see enemy badges, they have badges for things you cant get anymore, one of teh faction dosent even have a badge.-Op cards who can make 1 card deck, and dosent require any skill to play, if you make one of those decks you get easyly to 1750 points in 2 days.

												I just don't get why, but this game feels too dull. The mech of the game for me is meh, I got so damn bored playing the tutorial agian. Played it before during release, annnd It still feels like a lack luster game today. Sure loads of animated cards are here but they just don't have the appeal of art that I have in mind. Art style is not my cup of tea (though it does do a good job to impress), and the battles are like loading nerf darts then swapping them out. The sounds to the mech of the gameplay does not appeal to me at all. In all summary, it's like a watered down game to the battle animations and sound. But hey people, try it out, maybe it's for you, me on the other hand will stick to something with more of HS style of play.			"

												I'm giving this game a thumbs down by the slimmest of margins only because I don't want to truly recommend it and there's no ""meh"" button. I'd give it a 45/100 really.Good:- It's simple, entertaining, and fun- there's at least a campaign/story mode unlike a lot of other card games- the cards look niceBad:- said story mode is quite thin and shallow, very minimalistic dialog- nothing new brought to the table. There's a seemingly unique ""morale"" attribute that functions like health, but it rarely affects the outcome of any matches- very minimal animations, not only on the individual cards themselves but even during combat- the story mode is mind numbingly easy, the only true difficulty comes in certain matches when trying to figure out what the one, and only one, way to beat the undead opponent is.Bottom line is: overall it's not a horrible game, it's just really lacking and doesn't live up to the hype at all.  You read all these reviews and figure this is gonna be the omgwtfbest game ever and it's really, really ""meh"".  It's a fun few hours of entertainment, but really needs more polish and features to be worth the hype.- no eyecandy, there only seems to be one set windowed size and no graphic options			"

												Overview: Played this today for about 6 hours. It is a mix of Hearthstone and Might and Magic Duel of Champions. Not executed very well. Really amateur looking. Sound of characters in campaign is not normalised. Animations are tacky. Voice acting is also really tacky and amateur. Character script is useless, and looks like it was written by a 5 year old (Harry Portteresque).Tries tobe funny but just doesnt get there.Not really fun to be honest. Addons look to be ridiculously overpriced too on a side note.If it was free with all the addons I dont think I'd bother playing this. Not well thought out at all. Would prefer to have the time back that I spent trialing this one.Positives: Free to Play so you can make your own call. My advise is to not even bother if you like card games. I have seen worse though.			"

												Summary First:For a Trading Card Game it is a good attempt, still only recommended for those who are willing to spend serious cash.The reason why i cannot recommend it are multiple. It suffers from the inbuild flaws of TCG, that means those who have the better cards will always win. So when you start the game you have about 1 hours fun playing against the mediocre AI and in the (ridiculous short) campaign. Then you have nothing else left but to start PvP and EVERYONE keeps kicking your♥♥♥♥♥ Cause if you want to compete you need high end cards and everyone has them, except you. So if you are willing to invest a serious amouth of cash into this game, then trade cards for those that enable you a standart winning strategy, you wont have any fun in this game just serious amouth of frustration.

												Atrocious, and I mean atrocious, voice acting. The script the actors follow doesn't help any, either.Game-wise it felt clunky. Slow, awkward controls, not a lot of graphical feedback when playing spells (leading to ""did I play that? What did I just target?""), and the need to click each battle result away is just awkward. Uninstalled this as fast as my mouse would click.			"

												Overall flow and pace of the game feels worse than both Magic and Hearthstone, mainly that you get too many extra abilities at the start with the extra command zone and can freely shuffle around all of your creatures every turn. It feels very chaotic and not in a good way.Simultaneous turns seems like an interesting idea but ends up feeling a bit like a cup game. Guess wrong targeting a creature and the spell is pointlessly wasted. You can't really strategize consistently, just fire off some spells and hope for the best.For some reason they decided you needed two health totals, health and morale. Both kill you at zero, but do nothing till you get there. Seems like a design band-aid to awkwarly punish decks that burn through creatues, but feels really stupid in practice.Visual style is a bit of a mess with knights shooting handguns, robots and magic all haphazardly thrown together.Honestly I wouldn't suggest even trying it. The effort it takes to understand this game's many unintuitive mechanics would be best spent on more polished and fun games.			"

												This is one of those cases where all the foundations of success are there, but the architects wanted to put up a crooked house.The game is great, and could have rivaled MTG and Hearthstone, but disregard of their players, shady buisiness practices, and inept balancing have ruined it to the point of being nearly unplayable with anything other than the AI bots, at least if you don't want to spend lots and lots of money. AAAANNND, even if you DO want to spend money, you may, at times, find yourself cheated by ""mislabled"" sales and pre-release bundle issues.This game is for the rich. Stay away if you're not.			"

												I must say this is the best game I've played in years.  Its so darn good.  Back in the day I played Collectable Card Games such as Spell Fire etc.  This game is better than all those.  The GOOD:      1. You need skill.  No point and click.  You have to think about what move to make next.  You need to build a good deck, you just can'r slap cards together. You have to weigh which cards and combo's of cards to want.2. So many ways to build a deck, so many combo's. Plus they give noobs free weekly decks which match many built decks.  3. Game play is so good.  There is an Attack Zone, Defence Zone, Support and Leaders Zone.  Not just one big area like others. 4.  The developers are right there making changes and fixing bugs.  It is a small company but they fix things right away.5.  Fun.  Against humans you'll have a blast.  You'll loose at first but keep note of what cards and combo's the good players use and copy them!6.  Just like any CCG, Buy boosters and create the deck you want.The BAD1.  Match engine is getting an over haul. It's not that bad but you sometimes meet a really good player as a noob.2.  Rating system is getting an overhaul too.  It can be cruel is you're high up.  Gain little for a win but loose lots if you loose.3.  Trading is good, but they players are hard to trade with, I spent 20 minutes trying to trade for a few rares and the deal didn't do through.  It's easier to go to a broker and buy the card you want.Over all it's worth it if you like CCG's.  If you play the AI you get a bunch of free cards and you can earn points for cards and they are always throwing free ones at you.  This game is so darn good, it's ""Crusader Kings Good.""			"

It has single and multiplayer, you are able to obtain more cards for just playing (read here: you don't have to pay a cent to have fun) every card is animated and illustrated beautifully, I would honestly pay for something this good.

												I once gave this a upvote. Cause I enjoyed it, and because I worked for the developers.That was taken in the wrong way, and the review, which was clearly warrented because the game was pretty alright, was taken in the wrong way, as a false review (They didn't want it, because it seemed biased) so now, after I wasn't payed for the many hours I worked, or the actual work I handed in (which was enough for nearly 120 dollars of pay) I've decided, no, the company is actually really trash. Their games, whether released or in development, are trash. The people who work there. Trash. Their work ethics. Trash. Their ability to pay their workers for fair work. Trash.I hope this review is taken the wrong way as a biased review, cause it is. I literally hate this company from the deepest, strongest, absolute hatred that comes from my ice cold heart.If only the company cared. But oh wait, they don't. Cause their ♥♥♥♥ heads.			"

												Hi! I`ve read some reviews on this game and I`m amaized on how many positive reviews it has. And most of players have 20+ hrs in this game. Is really ridiculous!!! Why I find that ridicoulous, I will explain in the following review. SPOILERS AHEAD!!! TLTR and also game is about to be explained!!!I want to start by saying I don`t have many hours in game at the moment of this review (only 7 hrs) because I started just today, even tho I previously downloaded the game and after I saw you actually need to make an account to play it, I bailed out.So, today (16 July 2016) I`ve redownloaded this game, because a friend recommended to me and said it was fun and cool. It was anything but fun or cool.I have to say that I didn`t really enjoyed it! The fact that you must create an account ONLY inside game and not on their website (there`s no option to make an account on their website nor to log in), extremelly long Training (took me 2 hrs to complete it, with fails), tedious leveling and IP (Infinity Points) grinding, Predictable A.I. and also the fact that if you want to PvP, the game queues you against someone who cleary knows how to wreck you in the first 5 minutes in the game and who cleary spend Real Money to buy packs, you don`t have any option to play against new players! These things are a major turn down for me!!!Pros:- Animated cards and battlefield;- Simultaneous turns for both players or A.I.- Resources increase automatically so no need to sacrifice any of your monsters or spells to gain more resource;- Inside match ""Trading post"", where you have the options to shuffle your hand only 1 per match and get a different hand, draw a card (all of these cost Resouces, of course).- Beautifull graphics (at least not too bad or shady for my taste) and really nice designed artstyle on cards;- Ability to farm for card packs and avatars;- Ability to Trade;- Ability to gift store items to your friends or other players;- Ability to challenge your friends to duel you;- Low resource game (just 1.5 GBs);- Free to play;Cons:- You can create account only inside game and not on their website;- Long Training (2 hrs took me to complete it). Please name 1 more game where you have to spend 2 Hours in the tutorial because mostly of the fails!!! What tutorial is that where you can actually fail?!?;- Factions and Lore are not explained (who is against who and why);- Functions and main Menu are also not explained (how to return to main menu, how to add players as friends, how to ignore players, how to trade with other players, how to duel with your friends/other players, how to change your title/profile picture, basically ending up with default one);- Leveling and Grinding for XP and IPs is verry long and tedious (at least for me, it kinda feel like a waste of time, like I haven`t accomplished anything in this game);- No Achivements, Trading Cards or at least some freaking Badges;- A bug where your cursor is invisible (or disabled) during dialogues (mainly in Tutorial).Thank you for reading my review!!! I personally don`t really recommend this game but if your curious what`s about feel free to try it and later on, post your own review!!! Have fun!!!			"

								A great game worth many hours of fun for those who love Trading Card Games. Not recommending based solely on the fact that you really have to love TCG's to like Infinity Wars. A casual gamer who isn't crazy about TCG's would probably not like it.  I would be swayed to recommend the game if it stepped outside of the TCG box and did something no other TCG has done. Close, but no cigar. You dont have to spend a dime to enjoy the game. It helps, but like angry birds you don't HAVE to pay to play. If you love the structure and format of how MTG plays then give Infinity Wars a try. It took me over 60 hours to decide If I would recommend it which says a lot. I've edited my original review upon reflection of the comments. I've also edited down my review because I really do like the game even though I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.			"

								While the bluffing part of the battlfield makes for some interesting games the overall play is fairly simple and hardly engaging. The animated cards are nice and the graphics superb, making the game easy to get into and nice to look at while playing. The tutorials are good though the campaigns very short with the scenarios presented very limited, no real story or IP building going on here, though this area may be being worked on. The game doesn't appear to have a balance formula applied to the cards as some are outright broken and can drastically affect the outcome making it a clear have vs havenot affair. While they tout their variable play modes (eg pauper/merged deck (both players decks combined) or drafts, in the end the game appears to be heading directly towards pay2win area. They will of course say its not since you can theoretically farm IP and buy cards, the reality is that these lines have been used on players far to often. With no backing IP and a potential constant releasing of sets this feels very much like a M:TG style investment without the actual physical cards as proof of such.I have enjoyed playing it, but cannot justify any investment beyond the thankyou for the fun I have had ""demo'ing"" the product. Your mileage may vary of course.			"

												Don't let them kid you. If you want to be competitive when you start it IS P2W. Don't even waste your money in the blister or bundle paks. You could spend a fortune trying to get the cards you want. The pre-made decks are the way to go but don't buy them with real money just save your IP credits and buy them with those and don't waste 1000 credits (which is too much) to play draft or rift games.Be prepared like others have said cause you won't have near the cards that these veterans do in pvp. It's a joke to play pvp because they match you with just about anyone because the que is so empty in all the catagories. Basically it doesn't seem like anyone is playing this except the fanboys in the chat room.At first I liked this game but once I saw the structure and how the game really works no way am I wasting my time on it. MTG is a much better game and I've put too many years into it already and having to start over collecting just a ""handful"" of cards compared to MTG isn't my idea of fun.You will see a LOT of the same cards and same templates in pvp. Already in chat some players are coming in there asking for links to another players deck. Already just wanting to copy someon instead of using their own brain. There's only a handful of templates that win and win constantly and that's what you will see everyone playing. It get boring pretty quickly.For the most part the game has NO ai just scripted matchups to let you see how your cards play. It gives you false hope because you can pound the ai but as soon as you get in a real match you will see cards you've never seen before and plays you've never seen before.It's free if you can stomach the loss after loss after loss. But, what fun is that taking newbie decks into a battle of veteran decks and cards?You heard it from someone who knows trading card and collectable card games. This one has a long ways to go. Especially more cards and deck templates to play.			"

												So basically there's only 2 factions worth playing as, and only if you have the right cards.Also, even if you -do- have the right cards, you're either...A: going to be frustrated by the campagin as it random changes the rule on certain misions/ throws you in to scenario's you'll never encounter.B: Complete all the single player content and then play against players who (While nice) are far better then you and will absolutely beat the crap out of you.

								Not reccomended. Typical TCG uninspired bs like the rest. Too many abilitie(magic/spell) cards and not enough infantry mainline cards with the abilities. Just another poor TCG that tries but until everyone in the world realizes that MTG isn't what you base your TCG on then they will all just be another clone of the standard ""meta deck building and epeen stroke fest"". Would love to have a chance to play it but until 90% of abilities are put onto cards that require them to be put into harms way will just be another TCG with control decks like every other TCG that exists.

								It took no time at all to figure out this is nowhere near ready for primetime.

Personally I don't see anything in this that I can't have in many other ATCG's that have come before it.			"

I feel as though a lot of the game needs to be nerfed a pinch, the tutorial needs to be more subtle and slowed down (because, frankly, I felt rushed through it) with less horrible voice acting and dialogue from the ""Campaign Story,"" and maybe to be more specific it the rules and match types. Granted, I haven't played that long, but I've only emerged from the tutorial/prologue, and it's been over 2hrs of gameplay, which just seems to keep droning on. In a nutshell, the game needs a lot of reworking before I even consider redownloading it again.			"

								You supported him when he asked you for a small investment from your nice thick wallet, and in return you got a macaroni collage from a 30 year old.It's like playing Magic: the Gathering with that creepy older kid who spends all his money on cards and misrepresents the rules.  He knows every exploit and glitch in the game yet refuses to tailor his game to even out the odds or make it more fun.You will go up against common, bread-and-butter creature cards that started as 3 att/ 3 def cannon fodder, that have become 100/100 and unstoppable within a reasonable time, for no investment, for very little cost to play, that you have no way to counter or get through to attack OR defend.  This card also happens to be unrestricted and can appear infinite times in your deck.  This is only one example.You will go up against his favorite, all-star deck even if he knows you only have the starters.You will be told that you cannot undo a move you made mistakenly due to unclear wording, and will have lost your turn.  You MAY be allowed to keep the card in your hand, but its cost is gone and your turn is wasted.You will be attacked and hit for 1/4 of your total health, first or second turn, many times.He will not play fair in ranked matches or tournaments.  You will never see a reward for the draft tournaments you enter.  You will spend 1000 points (average win gets `150 in other game modes) and win 5 games if you're an exceptional player, just to break even.  You will not be able to choose your three most valuable cards freely, not even their type, and will be shafted completely for your tournament because your commander cards are 3 fodder critters that offer your other 40 cards no benefit.You will very rarely get more valuable, different or rare cards.  The ones you do can't be traded for things you want.You will grind for days to afford 15 random cards - 1-3 of which will be new to your deck, MAYBE.  More often you'll get the same cards.  That can't be traded.He will tell you he's trying to change and get his act together, but the last time you saw him shave, bath, self improve or de-roach his house was October of last year.			"

												The game Is good on the outside and I spent many hours in it. However as you get into the game, I found that the game developers themselves are not in it to make a game, just to make money. Massive bugs, broken game mechanics, and deceptive tactics are to name a few. In the midst of this they where making expansions too add more cards to buy, while the game was in beta. They broke immersion of the game to put star trek cards in the game(that are naturally more powerful than regular cards).  Support for the game is abysmally terrible, I went THREE MONTHS trying to fix an issue that should have taken three minutes, and the problem is now even worse in the game. The last email on the issue is “The Management Team has not yet made a decision.” If you want to play this game, you will enjoy it for at least a while. However, expect it to get old quickly, but don't put any money into it. Because if anything happens don't expect support to help you.			"

												This TCG says free but its not, its so heavily pay to win it makes Magic the Gathering look like pokemon...The cards in this game are so hard to get that for 3 days i played games and still didn't get anything useful. They have a joke of a currency that you can recieve by playing games, its called Infinity points...But if you start new you will face players who have tons of cards and usually wont ever win a game (which losses give 75 IP, wins are 100)...A booster pack of cards would take roughly 40 wins to afford, which is about 12-13hrs of game play if you win all your games. On top of the heavily pay to win aspect the game consitist of too many abilities and broken combo's that a player can actually win turn 3-4 if he draws a good opening hand. I do not see a point in have 5 abilities that do roughly the same thing nor do i respect a game that doesn't ban card combo's that are instant wins...Even MTG bans cards that are broken. This game will be fun for about the first 5 levels till you start playing against players, then at that point you wonder why you wasted the time. I'm giving this advice so that you guys don't waste time trying to play this game as a ""free"" player...if you have a deep pocket then go ahead and credit card warrior it up and enjoy picking on players that just wanted to play a ""free"" game.

This game feels very money grabby with no very liittle on earning cards while most of the good cards are behind a pay wall.  Don't recommend this game to no one while Hearthstone is much more clear game and alows you to earn cards at a better rate.. Only way to get them card is dropping tons of money for game that is very lack luster.			"

Early Access Review
								Great game, bad support. Been playing this game for 2 weeks and I realized i had a bug on my inventory that did not allow me to get any basic cards from 1 faction. Well, since the game was great i just send a message to the support and they answered me. That was 10 days ago, still with the same problem. I dont recomend this game since I can imagine someone spending real money on it, having a problem and trying to solve it(bye bye money). If they cant solve a simple problem like giving me back BASIC cards I dont think this game deserves to be played.Hey guys! But the game was great!TLDR: Worst support ever, 10 days and still nothing.			"

												Gameplay is good, but the game visuals are apalling. I stopped playing because the art is attrocious. For a game that calls itself an animated trading card game, the visual effects of the animated cards seem lazy and are nothing more than a cheap gimmick to try and draw people from Hearthstone. Anyone with an appreciation of art should stay far away from this game.			"

 a Quick Summary of how this Game Failed with Decks This game is flawed, very flawed. This is not a new flaw, this was there 2 years ago (they have yet to fix it). There is a deck where everytime someone on that deck dies, everyone gets stronger. This could be countered by winning from morale, but no. The guys barely cost any morale. Basically getting more invincible every turn. If you could simply nerf this, everything would be fine. No one else uses any other ♥♥♥♥ing deck. I think I'm the only one, honestly. That just shows how unbalanced this deck is. Making this game unplayable on multiplayer unless you go on drafts which what I can tell is not a good gamemode. ♥♥♥♥ this game and it's ♥♥♥♥ing incompetent devs, such an easy fix, yet it takes them more than 2 years to fix this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Disgusting ...

												this game is so bad. DO NOT PLAY IT. 1) the campaign isn't finished, actually thats an understatement... it not even started. Just 11 missions, 6 of which are challenges. So you dont even know how to play the game so you cant play online2) you think about playing online?? well thats a dumb idea... you go online to face against people who have every card in the game and you just using a starter deck... you dont know how to play cause the campaign is so bad and there is no deck builder help3) the community is pure toxic, you can talk to each other in game and there has not been a single game that i didnt get made fun of or called a retard. you go to global and say hey and everyone tells you to go f yourself...4) this game is pay to win, you can get in game money but after 5 hours of playing (and constant losing) i cant afford a single pack.overall just go play might and magic : Duel of Champions,,, game is good			"

								I recently tried this game again to update the review and it is still the same thing. The cards have good graphics and that is all to the cards. They have a short supply of abilities considering only one faction. While adding other factions the abilities can get scrambled because a large amount of abilities applies to how many cards of one specific faction a player has. That can limit your power if you play with more than one faction. Also when I went back I realised the games creativity has ran out. They incorporated the basic aspects of other card games like the undead and nature. They even modled cards off of other things like star trek. The only good to the game i have seen so far is the graphics on the cards. Besides that it feels like an underdeveloped Magic the Gathering.			"

												Pretty decent MtG knockoff making use of a simplified mana structure based on the number of turns. The art and story are tolerable, considering the game is free, but I definitely didn't feel any urge to buy packs of digital cards. Requiring players to grind for 20 levels to delve into ranked matches seems counterintuitive for a clone trying to steal customers. Play through the single player campaign and see if you like it enough to sink more money into it, otherwise just go back to playing Magic.			"

Early Access Review
								This game started out really well and had I reviewed it earlier it would be a recommendation but it has lost its way.To its credit the simultaneous turns is a great mechanic and the payment model is really well done (not pay-to-win but payment does feel like you are getting something). Also the cards (mostly) avoid being ridiculous and thus having decks that will never be countered except by a deck built just for that purpose (a problem Magic hit years ago and never found a way to fix other than limiting card choices).However, there are 3 reasons that you shouldn't bother with it;1. The support is mediocre (which is a better than most I suppose). They are supposed to refund you if bugs cost you in-game currency but they have never done so for me.2. They created a brilliant, immersive, fantasy world in which all the cards make sense. The races have their place and they all fit together well. Then they added Star Trek... No, really. So now your beasts from the nature themed faction can take on dudes with phasers... wait what? It's the most immersion breaking design decision I have ever seen in a game (and at my age, that experience goes as far back as the Commodore). It screams of a 'Trekie' designer desperate to include it just because they got the IP licence. And it plays about as well too.3. The community. I have lost count of the number of times I have been flat out abused in private chat by opponents just for running particular combo's and/or cards that they don't like. I have reported each case and non have been banned. This includes some extreme language, bigotry, personal attacks etc. yet the devs take no action to control it.			"

								This game shows much promise. There is an element of lots for the person that enjoys trading card games. For the gamer that does not have real money to play this game you may run into others that do, and it doesn't end well for you. The grind for cards is steep and there is not much at the top when you get there as someone else has already been and you realize the climb was not worth it after all. There is some bugs still in login, loading, store, avatar/game and others that need fixing. I think this game got green lighted a little too early still. For folks that just enjoy watchin developers for games grow and thrive, I like this game for that reason because this game developer has a lot of cool ideas and I hope he gets some time to hone his awesome skills!

												Was having fun untill the matchmaking started puting me against people who played for a year more or less, some of them had p2w cards that nothing in my deck could do anything about.And even if I did have such a card in my deck, able to deal with something, I have to rely soley on the RNG of card games for it to pop up, otherwise I lose.My first couple of pvp games were fun against one new player, and some friendly veteran players, after that I started getting peopel who threw vulgar insults at me in chat while throwing down some p2w cards that can destroy everything I have, 4 or 5 turns into the game.Game is fun, it's pretty quick, tutorial is pretty nice,gives you plenty of cards to start off with after you finish the (rather short and unfinished) campagin, and there are ""free weekly decks"" that you can play with. But sadly none of this matters when most of the people you are going to face are both more knowledgeable and skilled at this game than you are, and have superior cards that you may often not have any means to deal with.Had one guy put down a card that alone killed me, because it ignored every card I had in the defence zone (both flying and non-flying) with no way of attacking it or stopping it.Another player constnatly discarded any half decent cards I had while constnatly throwing endless amounts of cards to attack me, didn't have a single card that could do anything to them and within 3 turns I was dead, unable to place a single card down that entire time.Complaints aside this is a very fun game, when you're not losing to things you literally cannot do anything about, and so are forced to sit there and watch your health dissappear.

								in short meh.settings - far future sci-fi... not very exciting. but that is a question of preference I guess.mechanics - pretty weak imo. there biggest mechanics difference is taking a turn together with the enemy but all that does really is make the game a bit like blackjack but worse (since you know what is in the deck and here you don't.) also this mechanic basically makes it so there can be no interrupt cards which usually adds a lot to strategy.the resource model... pretty generic and limiting. you can at most play 3 factions together and each faction you play limits the power level. so while technically you can splash for 1-2 out of faction cards it will usually be too expensive. and also with the resource model you cannot do full fledged resource strategies. the zone management (especially combined with the same turn mechanic) is unexciting and limiting to strategy. and when i say it is limiting to strategy i don't mean there is no strategy involved, only that is it is less than other models.cards - due to the mechanics of the game the cards are very limited. without interrupts(because of same turn) and without unit enchantments you are literally left with creatures, board enchantments, and one-effect spells. so the deep strategy people talk about is arranging ""on enter effects"", optimal resource use, effects that move between zones, and contusion effects which are generally +/- effects. all in all i can say i don't like it at all. but if you are new to the genre then i would say go for it, a card game like that no matter how lacking is still better than most anything else. and you can use it as a stepping stone to something better. and frankly when i say something better there are not many products online that are better than this unless you want to go the underground route with things like lackey and octgn.

								In all honesty...this is borderline for me. The story is short and offers some cards as rewards. You also get booster packs with every level and such. Got through 2 stories before I got bored. Went into PVP and wow was I blown away. People had jacked up cards that I could not even come close to. Whats a bit annoying also is I was ""randomly"" set up with the same guy 3 times in a row, each time being destroyed and not even coming close. You earn ingame money slowly but if you go to the shop you can pretty much buy all the jacked cards you need for some premium currency. Now I realise yes yes, free to play games need to make money, as does everyone. The game itself is cool, and I really liked the ideas and the graphics. Puts a whole new level on TCG games. Even has a trading post which I found super neat.Pros:-Cool graphics-Level and objective rewards-Trading PostCons:-People who have the best cards basically with no skill-Low money gain-Story is only 8 missions long each, and its boring and more of a tutorial-PvP match up is not awesome "

												Yawn*Pay-to-win garbage just like Hearthstone and Magic.Feel free to try it out though. You get rewards up to certain level but after that its endless grinding IP to buy more packs.You can't buy decks with ingame currency that is earned by playing and you are forced to pay with real money.Game also has serious balance issues and rift drafts are more broken than Arena runs in Hearthstone.Im talking about cards that can negate your entire turn and prevent you from winning right from the start.I never thought I would play as bad card game as Hearthstone but Infinity Wars sure earns its place among the worst ones.

Revised:Options menu is rather poor in terms of actual options.All that's given is sound adjustment, there is no graphic modification.Personally, I wanted to turn off the animations of the cards, because it really didn't add anything to the game.Seems that the game is fairly slow-paced, which I guess is meant to give more time to think since it is strategy, I just don't find it entertaining.And I'm not so fond of this ""Morale"" feature, while others may argue that it adds a different challenge, I just find it as a way to win if a player has high-hp cards, which from my perspective, isn't balancing and isn't very fun.I will give the game props for its ""Breeding"" system (where you can actually ""breed"" a card). Seems to allow a new passive strategy where a player can make a surprising comeback with overwhelming the board.Is this game unique?Yes.Is it enough to entertain?At this moment, no.I lost interest when I started going to the Dragon Campaign (Don't know if that's the actual name, but it had a dragon) and lost simply because I could not kill one card in one hit, and my morale started dwindling down even though I was doing significant damage to his fortress...Then again, this might all be personal preference as some users enjoy this feature.

								I do not recomend this game. Although I do like the art style and animations. The game could use some updates, like not having to grind up to level 5 to be able to play friends. Or a less confusing tutorial. The game also expects you to be quite good at the game by the third level, the difficulty curve shot up at such a rate it could challenge the speed of light. I did like the little steam promo card. Overall, I give it a 4/10			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Trash.Warning: If you don't like this game people that work on it will harrass you!Updated Review:Because this game is *so* bad, and because Teremus wanted to argue every point... I've re-written the review.Why Does Infinity Wars Suck?============================1) Why does this review have so many thumbs down? - Lightmare staff. I know for a fact that 3 Lightmare members came here specifically to give my review a thumbs down. (Note to Lightmare: thumbs down is not for reviews you do not agree with.) They are constantly monitoring reviews. Especially Teremus. If you look at all the negative reviews for this game, (And there are many.) you will find that all of them have at least one thumbs down. Why? Teremus. He and the rest of Lightmare are attempting to bury negative reviews. Especially reviews that show any level of intellect.2) What's the problem? - Well... it's complicated, and there's actually several problems. To explain them, would mean explaining the entire game system, and well... I'm going to try to avoid it. I'm sure you don't want to read it anyway. (You either know it already, or you can look it up.) It should be sufficent to say that this is basically Magic: The Gathering. There are differences. The main one is that there are no ""Land"" cards for mana. You simply gain one ""Resource"" point per turn. (Which is equivelant to Magic's mana.) This brings us to a problem...3) Potential Lawsuit - A few months ago Hasbro subsidiary Wizards of the Coast (You may have heard of them.) sued Cryptozoic over their digital card game Hex: Shards of Fate. WotC claims that Hex is virtually identical to MtG. Hex had a successful kickstarter that raised over $2,000,000. Which is probably what drew the attention of WotC. The results of this legal battle will impact Infinity Wars. If Cryptozoic loses, then Lightmare will likely be sued sometime in the future. I mean, why not? With legal precident, all WotC would need to do is point their finger, and Lightmare could be destroyed. (Because Lightmare is very small, and merely the threat of a lawsuit would be devastating.) I sincerely hope this does not occur. If it does, it may herald an end to digital card games. With this in mind, I am uncomfortable spending any money on Infinity Wars. At least, until the lawsuit is resolved. (And who knows how long that could be?)4) Not Pay-to-Win But... - Over the years, I've played many card games. They all work the same way. You play for a while, you come up with some decks, and the game seems fun. Then... you face someone with some ridiculously overpowered combination. A person you simply cannot defeat... no matter what. The only way you could possibly win is by having specific cards to beat that specific combo. Don't have those cards? You gotta spend money, or trade. - Paying money doesn't necessarily make you any better at the game. However, it will give you many more cards than you would have otherwise. Just like any TCG, more cards means more options. More options is generally better, and should give you the advantage. Whenever the game is called-out for being P2W, the response is always, ""You can earn everything for free."" This is true, but the grind is excessive. You can either re-play the campaign over and over or you can face human opponents. However, many of human opponents have spent money and have extremely powerful decks. When you lose a PvP battle, you get maybe 10-20 points worth of in-game currency. To purchase cards, you need (at minimum!) 1000 points of game-currency. Unless you are some kind-of card game genius, chances are high that grinding for cards isn't feasible. It's possible, sure. However, the time it consumes means that purchasing cards makes more sense. That's why people say the game is P2W. It's not correct, but it isn't quite a lie either.5) Pricing Structure - It doesn't help Lightmare's case when they provide an option to spend over $900(USD) in their in-game store. What does $900 get you? In-game currency that is non-refundable. (A premium version of standard form of in-game currency.) It actually provides more in-game currency than you can actually spend. You can literally buy everything that exists in the game, and still have a fortune leftover. (and probably everything in the future.) It begs the question: Who would want to do that? You could easily spend far less, and still own every card. Why is the option even there? I can only conclude that it exists for some form of exploitation. You'd have to be quite well-off to have $900 just lying around. The average person isn't going to drop that much cash on a digital card game by an indie developer. At least, not all at once? No way. To me, this is evidence of a serious disconnect between Lightmare and potential players of Infinity Wars. - Teremus says that the people of Lightmare are gamers. They love TCGs. I imagine then, Lightmare wants to create the best possible dTCG. Start by fixing the core problems with TCGs. What is the *worst* part of TCGs? Do you remember, or were your lives that much different than mine? I'll skip to the point... The worst part is the cost. You pay money, and you may or may not get ANYTHING you wanted from a card pack. This is wrong. It's exploitative. It's basically a 100% legal form of gambling. (Especially when you consider that some cards are much more valuable than others.) With a dTCG, there are many opportunities to mitigate or eliminate this issue entirely! You could reduce the probability of pulling a rare from a pack you already own. Once you have six copies of a card, the probability would drop to zero, unless you have six of everything else. Alternately, you could take this in an entirely different direction. You could just make cards available to buy. Yeah, just let me pick the card I want, and then I pay for it with in-game currency. You could even monitor which cards are being played the most and purchased the most... and adjust pricing based on those figures. Also, real-life TCG cards are expensive. It's understandable though. You are paying for the cards themselves, the artwork, printing costs, shipping, et cetera. Infinity Wars boosters cost ~$3 per pack if I remember correctly. (Essencially the same cost as if I didn't have to ""middle-man"" through premium in-game currency. It assumes you spent less than $100 on currency. Which is fair.) Why can't it be $2 or even $1 per pack? At $3, I had to consider the value of such a purchase. At $1, I probably would've spent $10 or even $20 on my first day. I have even more ideas, but... Despite everything I can think of, Lightmare went with a traditional cost, and a traditional way of buying cards. I'm sure they've had similar ideas. - I guess Lightmare is really caught-up on the idea of selling digital cards the same way that gaming stores sell them. 16-17 years ago, I was a big fan of SWCCG. The game has been dead for quite some time, but I still own THOUSANDS of cards. On which, I spent hundreds of dollars. Sometimes I regret spending the money, but I still own the cards. No matter what, I still have the cards. If someone is willing to learn, I have enough cards to build many decks. The cards may be sitting in boxes, but I manage to play a game every few years. Digital cards do not leave the game. I don't get to keep those if Lightmare(or just Infinity Wars) shuts down, or I lose internet access. I can't play Infinity Wars offline. Therefore, digital cards have significantly less value to me than real cards. Lightmare needs to realize that Infinity Wars is more of a video game than a card game. It's competing with other video games for a player's time and attention. So, it needs be of a similar value to a console game, and not an offline TCG.Apparantly, Infinity Wars is for ""Hardcore"" TCG gamers to ""Dominate"" opponents. (See below)

								After playing it for a few hours i can tell that it's not the game for me. The ""arena"" fee is way too high, packs that give you 3 cards cost 1k coins, and after completing the campaign and doing a few bot battles and PvP games i ended up with 2.7k, so that's really low. The dailies are crap, the requirements are insane on some of them-win a PvP game after using 9 spells, really? At least you can play draft against bots for free, that's pretty fun. There is depth to it but i can see some decks just losing all the time against other decks, and winning without a problem against others.			"

								To start with the tutorial is lackluster at best, without any pervious knowledge of TCG's this game would leave you baffled and confused as to what to do.  This along with an over complicated game board, makes the game even more dawnting for anyone wishing to start in TCG's.if you want to try a game with tactics this isnt the game for you the campaign is so simple that aslong as you throw all the cards you possess on to the board and go full attack you will win everytime. It is nice however to see that all cards have animations just not to the standard you would hope to see in a f2p TCG and other games such as Hearthstone do this in a much better way. Overall not bad but would suggest forking out a bit of extra cash for Magic the Gathering or trying Hearthstone and waiting for IW to pad out a little bit			"

												The best CCG i have played. No. choice for ftp ccgs. Give it a try the art is amazing and NO CCG has combat like it. It is 1000x more in depth than hearth stone and still easy enough to learn. Bettter the Might and magic and magic the gathering aswell. All 25 of my play hours have been done within 2 week thats how awsome it is.			"

												Game is fun only with a few minor problems such as the interface which could be better tbh.Different to you standard card games, however definatly worth a try :) True there is a lack of cards, however, every update they add more. Apart from this you get cards for free daily and by just playing the game unlike many pay to win card games.It takes a little to get used to the mechanics but if you are a vivid card game player you will catch on quickly !

								I absolutely love card games, especially well designed and unique ones, and this one really got it down! I love just about everything about this game. It's got the perfect design; easy to pick up, hard to master. You can plan and strategize through multiple available factions, and even mix and match through them, which I really love, since I hate faction-locking in most other TCGs. They've got it very well designed for both players that choose to play free or pay, and paying gives no extra advantages. They've already got more than 300 cards to choose from, and plan to release more regularly, and I seriously love the fact that they're all animated! If you like card games *at all*, I strongly suggest this game!			"

								This game actually has an amazing amount of depth. I consider this to be one of the best tcgs right now, in my opinion better than solforge and on par with hearthstone. I'm looking forward to a ton of hours with this game and the best part is that it's free. I think the game does a very good job with not being pay to win because although you can purchase cards, you can also get the majority of them just from playing. There is also a mode where you and your opponent's cards are mixed up together so that makes it pretty fair. All in all, a superb game!			"

								So far i'm enjoying the game alot. I really enjoy how they made morale it not only makes the game feel unique it also helps when your having long drawn out games. The animations are cool and very well made. I only wish the campaing went longer than 8 missions. I realize the game doesn't revolve around campain mode ,but a stronger story would be great. For example I didn't feel really engaged story wise in the warpath campaign ,but the A.I is really good. One of my largest complaints which is a very small one at that is that you can't mulligan a hand or redraw a new one. Athough my deck has pretty good synergy it just seems a bit odd. Although that doesn't keep you from enjoying the game it's a very small problem. The game is also in beta and I must say it's very well polished and playable compared to other games in beta. Overall if you like MTG or card games in general I would reccomend this.			"

								I love this game! It is really special in the depth of strategy needed. Made me feel like digging up my old Yu gi Oh cards. Making a deck has perfect rule balance for most ecassions. Only thing I count cheating is the bringing to life card mixed with the Gateway to Heaven loacation card. Otherwise everything is perfectly balanced and fun. Even if it is glitchy in random multiplayer if you add them as a friend it works smooth and perfectly. If your not feeling up to playing multiplayer you can just play the campaign and get some new cards. Thanks Lightmare Studios for making a game I love to go back to.			"

								Very fun game. The gameplay doesn't feel as slick as Solforge and Hearthstone, but it does some things - a lot of things - I got from MtG those games don't - silly, silly jhonny combos, largely due to a system where you can hold your creatures back and build up. It also has a /brilliant/ way of balancing Faction mechanics with the Command zone, where you choose 3 creatures as 'commanders,' which you have access to each game - this further encourages the ability to build decks around paticular cards.

								Very fun game. The gameplay doesn't feel as slick as Solforge and Hearthstone, but it does some things - a lot of things - I got from MtG those games don't - silly, silly jhonny combos, largely due to a system where you can hold your creatures back and build up. It also has a /brilliant/ way of balancing Faction mechanics with the Command zone, where you choose 3 creatures as 'commanders,' which you have access to each game - this further encourages the ability to build decks around paticular cards.

								So far i'm enjoying the game alot. I really enjoy how they made morale it not only makes the game feel unique it also helps when your having long drawn out games. The animations are cool and very well made. I only wish the campaing went longer than 8 missions. I realize the game doesn't revolve around campain mode ,but a stronger story would be great. For example I didn't feel really engaged story wise in the warpath campaign ,but the A.I is really good. One of my largest complaints which is a very small one at that is that you can't mulligan a hand or redraw a new one. Athough my deck has pretty good synergy it just seems a bit odd. Although that doesn't keep you from enjoying the game it's a very small problem. The game is also in beta and I must say it's very well polished and playable compared to other games in beta. Overall if you like MTG or card games in general I would reccomend this.			"

Overal and interesting game that might have potential, if you dont like it there is a butt load of other cardgames on steam some free....some not.			"

								This game is fantastic. The learning curve is a bit steep; lots of cards and mechanics to get a hold of. The time it takes to unlock decks doesnt take long, and the actual deck building reminds me a lot of Magic. I was playing Hearthstone pretty religiously and can honestly say that I find Infinity Wars to be the superior game. They both have their pluses and minuses, but as an actual Magic player I found this game the more rewarding option. Give it a chance, you wont be disappointed. If you want, my invite code is D55C4; add me to friends, I can help if you need any, or join you in trading cards or draft.			"

												The Game is fun and has a number of cards,however half of the cards your gonna get are probably not going to be tradable,next you can buy card decks (with IRL money) which are garaunteed this ultra card or this rare,however all cards are obtainable through several ways.Now if the game had more card variety, and wasnt based of getting better cards there would be a improvement.The game has to restrict you however of using a large variety of cards with something I call the 'loyalty' system,where basically if your commander(s) (unit cards that are garaunteed for you to have (theres a commander panel) with a max of 3, where if you have a commander for this faction you get 1 'loyalty'(my own term) cards which are relatively weak,but if you get 2 commanders of one faction you get cards of that faction that may need 2 'loyalty' which are pretty strong,now once you have 3 commanders for 1 faction, you can get any card for that faction.THe thing with card variety in Infinity Wars is that you pretty much are limited to have a really weak variety deck or a single play style strong deck, which severely effects deck variety.A alternative with this is to add more commanders or make less dependency on commanders.Strong cards cost alot of resources (a thing which lets you use unit cards,spells,or alternative ways to spend resources which effect the game,resource is increased by 1 every turn and it is completely replenished each turn) to prevent it from being used too early in the game,and so that the game isnt based off just whoevers gets a better draw.The game is good but doesnt have enough cards and deck variety at the moment so I rate this game 7.5/10 "

												Its a good game, the animations are nice and has alot going for it.  I found the sound design lack-lustre even menu buttons do not have 'activated' sounds, and it would be nice to have sound animations when you play a card I miss that from Hearthstone. I woulld suggest to people to support this game, hopefully improvements at the back end will continue to happen - they got alot of the core gameplay correct and that is the important part.  Also the UI is superior to MTG Online and the game is more complex than Hearthstone mechanics.  Again, the only thing missing is upgraded sounds across the board for a more immersive experience without the game feels a bit bland.  I do however, recommend this game.			"

												This is actually a quite good F2P! If you've ever had fun with TCGs, you have to try this! Not a single Cent is needed for all the cool cards the game is throwing at you just for playing it, and it won't take long to start building strong decks.You might stumble over bugs though, since this is still work in progress, but nothing gamebreaking so far.

												Decent card game, I tried this in early access and I'm liking how much smoother the menus and UI are now. When I first tried it I hadn't played any other TGC games and thought there was no goal or the game was very casualized/felt like there was no balance, but now after having played HS as my first TGC game, I see that the balance is pretty good.I do recommend giving it a try, maybe you'll like it.

												Brilliant! I would happily pay for this game, the fact it's free means there's no reason you shouldn't own it. Having spent 7+ hours playing, I've still got a good deal of campaign, practice and online modes to complete. There are a huge variety of card types, more of which can be paid for, though spending no money in-game does not diminish the experience one bit. You can play so many different ways, using custom decks, starter decks and a TONNE of different abilities, both offensive and defensive. Download and play NOW! You won't regret it. "

												This is a really good game, better than hearthstone...... but it's ruined by the matchmaking.To play against players of my lvl i must do ranked, but for ranked i need to be lvl 10. The campaign it's only 6 missions, I complete them and I play 10 match vs AI and i'm only lvl 3. Reach lvl 10 only vs AI it's boring, but if I play normal PvP I have to fight vs high lvl and I have no chances.So... what can I do between lvl 4 and 10????? Introduce a new ranked for low lvl.... or something else..... becouse now the game is fun for who plays from day one, but it's really boring for all other new players.			"

												I am a lover of card games since waaay back. So i am pretty confident to recomend this one , the rules are pretty cool, similar to magic, but with it's own twists.Battle are pretty fun also.BUT, there are two MAJOR flaws that have to be adressed with this game, otherwise it's demise is already set.The ""campaign"" is ridiculous. Just play it and you will know. I really hope they are looking into it.And the biggest flaw in my opnion is the UI , it is simply terrible, Giant Arial Fonts everywhere, Grey boxes with drop shadows. Font bugs, Gigantic boxes and buttons, no animations at all. My biggest concern is that the game which is awesome, will surely crumble as it's foundations are really poorly done. UI is everything to a card game.Still goodgame. hopefully they will adreess to this concerns, as they are pretty obvious.			"

												Pros+ Great artworks+ Animated Card+ 8 faction to choose+ You can buy booster pack without spend money + Same chance to get rare cards whether you buy it with real cash or in-game currencyCons- Matchmaking system is a mess, you'll likely meet premium player who is strong enough to beat you with only few cards - in-game match rewards is too low, you'll get 150 Infinity Points ( in-game currency) after you win against AI or after beaten by high level/premium player ( you'll get more if you win against other player, but the chance to meet low level or another free player is too low). So if you hate losing, you'll need about 35 wins to get a decent booster pack7.5/10			"

												I would somewhat recommend this game. Although the thing that bothers me the most is the very slow progression rate. U will earn 150 in game cash each round, that is if u win. need 5250 money for a 15 card booster pack. So u could guess it takes a good while to make the money, and to actually be able to build your own deck after your own playstyle. This is what a card game is all about for me, if u cant play as u would like to, its gonna take away some fun. So using pre-build decks is not really my style. If u dont mind putting alot of time in a game its a great, fun game. The gameplay is nice and pretty fluently, with a nice amount of tactics involved, tho its still an easy to understand game. And this is actually what keeps me playing. The gameplay is alot of fun, i just wished u would have some more sense of self progression without depending on pre-made decks.			"

												A very cool TGC with some unique stuff and complex play, but while I've really enjoyed it I can't quite fully recomend it.Pros:Simultaneous turns - this is one of my favorite things about this game, more turn based games need this!  It makes the game go faster, more stategy in trying to guess what others will do etc.Good Unique art - the art is well done and best of all it not all generic fantasy or scifi stuff it's a neat mix.  Zombie robots, Sci-fi Warrior stuff etc.  The card animation stuff is really nice too.Unique fractions & Mechanics - A lot of the fractions can end up playing quite differently and the varriation of cards allows for a lot of different decks and plays.Cons:Kind of expensive & grindy to get cards.  I wish working toward getting cards was more fun.  I think there is a lot they could do here.  Making trading easier would even help a lot.  Right now it feels like you have to wait forever to maybe get one new useful card, or throw quite a bit of money at it.Too varried in terms of decks and play styles you can end up with decks that are too specialized or you need to know the trick to beating them.  This gets frustrating and reminds me of playing old magic where there are these trick cards and combos that just feel out of the blue and unfair.I think it's worth trying but just know what your getting into.

												Read this review first. Also, I started playing this game two weeks ago from the post date of 8/11/15, so everything I'm saying is current.This. Game. Is. *Awesome*.I played Magic The Gathering my entire childhood, MTG Online, WoW TCG, Hearthstone, and Hex, and they all pale in comparison. I've heard nonsense in these reviews ranging from matchmaking issues to.... ""ths game sux cuz not nuff dbl xp wkends"".... (seriously? lol)At the end of the day, TCG's (or CCG's *shrug*) are *all* about the cards, and mechanics of the game. This game is So much more fun, complex, and strategic than *any* other game in the genre, bar none. Anyone who tells you differently is lying, an idiot, or rage-quit because they lost their first battle and got angwy.I'm not just some fanboy. There are a couple of glitches, and from what I hear, there could be a better matchmaking system I guess (though I find I win a completely reasonable amount of matches, regardless of being new). However, the game itself just can't be beat. Try playing this game for a few days and going back to Hearthstone. Go ahead, I just did it. I was literally *bored* to tears. It doesn't have one tenth the depth or strategy that Infinity Wars has. It's just a fact, guys.The cards are *beautiful*, *all of them are animated*, and...you...can... *trade* with your friends... (or enemies, or strangers... whatever). For those of you who have actually played other online TCG's, I'm sure you can appreciate putting the 'T' back into the acronym. I don't know about you guys, but that was half of what it was about when I was a kid. There are *8* incredibly distinct and well-designed factions to choose from, each with their own goals, combos and strategies that make sense, and carry a personality of their own. You can *combine* them into a deck of your choosing, and the combinations really let your own deck designs shine. The game has 4 zones during play. One of which is the 'Commander' zone, which is a set of 3 characters of your choosing that start on the board from turn 1. While I, myself, found it a bit 'too much' when i first started, it's come to be one of the most amazing and distinguishing mechanics this game has to offer, bringing a new level of customization and gauranteed strategy to your deck.Don't listen to the nay-sayers. If you're here on this page because you're bored of what little Hearthstone has to offer, download this, and thank me later. "

												I haven't played any card games in a while but I'd definitely have to reccomend this one, the gameplay is pretty well balanced. And games tend to be fast paced but still incredibly engaging, The card art is very nice and the factions are varied and interesting, all with different playstyles. They've got a very nice FTP system as well. You're able to obtain every card in the game without paying any real currency, In game money is used to buy booster packs while premium currency can be used to buy additional ""starter decks"" (which free players can obtain through playing a factions campaign). As well as different aesthetic card backs or playing fields. There are many gameplay options, including mixed decks, and a drafting mode called a rift run in which you're given a choice of 4 cards at a time to build a 40 card deck and compete against other players doing the same.Overall 10/10 cardgame very fun.

Early Access Review
								So far i'm enjoying the game alot. I really enjoy how they made morale it not only makes the game feel unique it also helps when your having long drawn out games. The animations are cool and very well made. I only wish the campaing went longer than 8 missions. I realize the game doesn't revolve around campain mode ,but a stronger story would be great. For example I didn't feel really engaged story wise in the warpath campaign ,but the A.I is really good. One of my largest complaints which is a very small one at that is that you can't mulligan a hand or redraw a new one. Athough my deck has pretty good synergy it just seems a bit odd. Although that doesn't keep you from enjoying the game it's a very small problem. The game is also in beta and I must say it's very well polished and playable compared to other games in beta. Overall if you like MTG or card games in general I would reccomend this.			"

												While I believe the game is great fun, and offers lots of strategy and play variety, there was one thing I couldn't get past. It was the fact that 2 or 3 factions were vastly overpowered. I found myself using a faction whose strategy interested me, only to be crushed by people playing the OP factions. Even the designers know they're OP cause in the campaign, you frequently go against these factions and not much else. If you can look past this, you definately play this game. If you can't this isn't for you.			"

Only thing I count cheating is the bringing to life card mixed with the Gateway to Heaven loacation card. Otherwise everything is perfectly balanced and fun. Even if it is glitchy in random multiplayer if you add them as a friend it works smooth and perfectly. If your not feeling up to playing multiplayer you can just play the campaign and get some new cards. Thanks Lightmare Studios for making a game I love to go back to.			"

												If you're a fan of MTG and want a digital TCG that's not as simple or luck-based as Hearthstone, I highly recommend this game. The mechanics do take a bit of getting used to. Both players plan their turns at the same time, click a button, and the system sorts out how it all works. It's a rather unique and interesting way of going about a card game that leads to lots of extra strategy and complexity, in a very good way.The game can be a bit buggy, something the small team is always working on, and the player base isn't massive since it hardly gets any marketing. Yet, there's a lot of fun to be had with the game, just check my time played with it. The new questing system helps explain the game in easily understandable ways and gives you lots of free cards just for completing it. There's also plenty of free cards from leveling (easily a bunch of booster packs in the first few hours of playing). IP (free currency) does build a bit too slowly to buy new packs in a timely manner, but they're tweaking those values while still trying to keep the game balanced. And balance is key. While there's some really rare cards that can be hard to get, having them is not pay-to-win. Some good strategy and a  well-built deck can beat those cards, because everything is fairly well balanced and the devs  frequently adjust cards to maintain the balance.So, totally check this out!

												TL;DR Good concept and potential, but nagging problems prevent it from being goodInfinity Wars has a lot of innovative ideas: the command system, the different battlefield zones, players having both health and morale that they have to watch, but in the end the game is bogged down by a clunky progression system. It's very difficult to get new cards (two cards free per day, 3,000 IP (the free currency) for a booster pack, which takes a while to earn considering you only get a few hundred IP for a win, at most. Leveling is slow and eventually becomes a ceaseless grind at the higher levels, with no incentives or rewards other than getting a free pack every levelup (the game has 30 levels in all. I'm level 26) But the biggest problem isn't the price, it's the fact that the game offers no way to get rid of excess cards. You can include three copies of most cards at max in your deck, but the vagaries of luck and rarity have caused me to have over 10 of some common cards, and only one of others. As of this writing, I have 27 Wealthy Nobles. The game has no disenchant option, so the cards just sit there, effectively wasted IP. This also makes building your own deck difficult, as you can't get the cards you need. I still think the game has potential and I would return if some of these things were fixed, but right now, I can't recommend it.			"

												I like the gameplay. The board gets complicated as you go along. I have issues with 2D/3D games due to a brain trama. So I couldn't play for very long at a time. I have been playing Plainswalker for several years. Set up the same with some intresting extras. FTP can't get better than that.			"

												Very uneven TCG.On the positive side lie the mechanics and card design. Developers used clever solutions to reduce influence of rendomness on the results of a game and introduce a high skill ceiling. Command zone mechanic makes decks much more consistent. This diminishes dependance of having good draws and puts more emphasis on deck construction. Meanwhile, the way targetting works with different zones of play leaves a lot of space for bluffing, mind games and outsmarting the opponent. Finally mechanics are rich and complex, allowing for variety of strange, powerful and sometimes even silly combos.Another strong point is the art quality. As always, there are some hits and misses, but the style chosen by creators works well. Also, each card is animated and while some of animations are very simple (say, a billowing cloak on a static character), some cards are short animated stories in an of themselves (Give Him a Jetpack taking a cake in this category).All of the above makes for a card game that, in my opinion, is much more satisfying than the biggest F2P TCG at the moment, that is Hearthstone.The negatives are mostly of technical nature. From time to time strange bugs crop out, servers can be problematic and functionality of client is debatable. Interface works passably well, but is not the most comfortable. Deck building window and trade window spring to mind as examples of less than stellar when it comes to quality of use.Also, the in-game economy may be unwelcome for some. Trading cards is a staple of the genre, but ability to craft a card that one requires at the time is definitely convenient in comparison to looking for someone who both has it and wants anything of what you want to trade. Infinity Wars is however based purely on interplayer trade in that regard (and of course purchasing boosters for either in game currency or cash). This can be either positive or negative, depending on preferance.I still recommend the game, since positives outweight the negatives by a large margin and it is worth giving it a try.			"

												Solid card game! It's no Magic the Gathering but it definitely holds some charm on it's own. The interesting mechanic is the ""Simultaneous Turn"", both players plan their turns at the same time and then they play out.  It eliminates the 'weakness' Hearthstone has of once your turn is over you can just sit there and watch yourself get destroyed.  The Factions have interesting card mechanics, nothing that hasn't been seen before though.  The art is very nice I must say but I reckon they could have gone for some smoother animations on the cards themselves.  For a game that runs in 60 FPS having the animations on the cards be anything less make it stick out a bit.  Do I recommend this game?  Hell yeah, it's got style, character and an inovative turn mechanic.  If you're looking for a new online card game that isn't as basic as let's say, Star Realms, not as random as Hearthstone and not as time consuming as Magic the Gathering.  Then this is a decent little card game one can get into! Game On.			"

												I was really excited about this game but the more I saw the cards they were putting out the less I liked it. I mean they look cool and they are cool if you are the one using them but they are obscenely overpowered. One card which you can have as many of as you like give +2 to health and damage to the creature anytime a zombie dies so people just put three of them in their command zone where no one can touch them and bring them out when they have 20 health 20 damage and nothing can kill them. There is a spell which summons every creature in BOTH graveyards to their side. It is basically an I win button. I am used to losing at these sorts of games but I want to lose and feel it was due to the enemy skill not due to them having ""I win"" cards in their deck.			"

												(I really play a lot of card games..)But this one is above most of those I played yet.The game is still in developpement. The menu is not always intuitive. There is often bugs.But, in my opinion, the game system is amazing.Each player have a deck of 40 cards and 3 commanders. The commanders are regular creatures but they start in the game. You can use their abilities but you can't use them to fight until you play the on the battlefield like other creatures.You can put your creatures in three zone: Assault, Defense and Support. The creatures in Assault will fight the creatures in the opponent Defense and deal damage to his fortress if you can. The creatures in Defense will prevent the opponent's creatures in Assault from damaging your fortress. Creatures in Support will be out of combat and protected from some spells.So, your fortress have 100 health but you also have 100 morale. You lose morale each time one of your creatures dies.And, each player moves and play spells at the same time. You must anticiapte your opponent moves.There is many factions in the game and the cards you can play in your deck depend of your commander's factions. Different factions will give you more variety while three commanders from the same faction will give you stronger cards of that faction.You will soon unlock starter decks for each factions. These decks are obviously weaker than most of the decks you'll see online but they are still very fun to play (at least against AI) because each faction have excellent synergy together.Even better, each factionis better than somes and weaker than others, like a rock, paper, cissors game but with eight factions.In my opinion, this game is among the best cards games even if some parts still bug. If you love strategic games, I highly recommend you to try this one!			"

												I came to this game as a complete newbie to trading card games in general and I love it!The game is pretty good at telling you how to play and teaching you little thigs you might miss through features such as the Campaign and more importantly the Academy missions. These are really good for getting your mind thinking in the way it needs to.Also getting cards is so simple when you start. I first looked on the store and was tempted to spend some real money on the Cpollection Booster cause it would you know, Boost my Collection right? It is not needed, ever I wwouldnt think. You get a complete Starter deck for each faction for free just by playing through the first three campaign missions for that faction. You get more cards for that faction after completing 5 games of their campaign and then more when you finish their campaign (8 missions). And that is for every faction in the game. You also get a fre login bonus evry day and a free bonus when you have played three games that day. These bonuses are usually a single random card but can be booster packs of 15 random cards too.Playing the game is great fun, requires alot of thinking, but also a ton of luck too. You can build the best deck you can and as the card draw is random you can still find yourself struggling or even defeated by turn 3! I am fairly sure it will be the reliance on luck that will eventually turn me off playing but for now i am enjoying it immensely.The one major downside i have foud is that all the cards you gain in the ways I have outlind above are 'Soulbound', that is they are locked to your account and cant be traded as bought cards can be. This wouldnt be so bad except I have already got 8, 9, 10 or more of some cards that you can only ever have 3 of in a deck. i have no way of getting rid of these extras.			"

												Let me start out by saying that I love CCG games.  Infinity Wars has not dissappointed but for me it leaves a little to be desired.  I know it is out of the norm that someone who enjoys playing CCG games prefers to strictly play offline against the AI, but that is me.  With that being said, if you're looking for a type of review based on the online PvP of the game you won't find it here.On that note, I'll go over the good features of the game.  I love the illustrations and the variety of cards in themselves is great.  Also, the animation on EVERY card is a nice touch.  The cards are well-thought, mostly balanced with some Epic cards being game changers but in my opinion, thats the great thing about the CCG game.  The gameplay, process, and strategy that are involved is also very good.  Without getting into it too deep, you basically have your character cards, gear cards, location cards etc.  Your main goal is to destroy your enemies fortress by attacking with your characters.  A nice twist on this game however, is that each character has a listed morale.  Now if that creature dies, your faction loses that much morale.  Your starting fortress and morale bars start at 100 each.  If either reach 0 then you lose the game.  Like I said, just the basics as there are certain strategies to get you to that goal.  You can also completely customize your decks with cards awarded after receiving new booster packs after each level gained or through their online store for purchase.  I've played about 11 hours on this game so far and have not spent anything as of yet and have several Rare cards, 1 Epic, and 0 Legendaries at this point to give you an idea.  One major love of mine regarding the customization is that there are 3 slots for you to choose which faction you want in that slot.  You can assign a Commander for each one of those 3 slots, ensuring those cards are on the battlefield for you at game start.My only negative point with this game is that there really isn't any other mode for me to play other than ""Practice"".  And this mode only allows me to play against 4 specific decks with a rated difficulty.  Therefore, 11hrs in I'm getting a little bored.  Other than that, if you're into the online gaming then this might be for you as I feel like the gaming mechanics and overall replayability of the game is right on.			"

The Campaign is great bedcause you can do play several different campaign's that you get rewards for completeing like card packs,cards and money, and once you complete the entire campaign for thaqt raced you get teh starter deck for it. its fun ive spent a while in it and im going to continue playing i hope you give it a try.P.S sorry if i typed anything incorectly but this thing dosn't have auto-correct			"

I can't wait to unlock PVP as I think going up against another person will be a blast WIN/LOSE.  But for anyone looking for a card game to play I think your search should end here.			"

												I have to recommend this game, but I need to warn people of something now.This IS a Trading Card Game. It is not a pure Free to Play, or a Pay to Win game. If you don't like the idea of buying boosters or organising trades, don't get this game. YOu will end up with extra cards and there isn't a craftign system like Hearthstone, that said there's also no secondary market so unlike MTG there are no rares worth  thirty quid by themselves, most are on a rarity to rarity basis.The game itself is a blast. The rules and flavour are fresh and original and it does things you simply can't do in a physical TCG, the gameplay is fun and they hand out a free rotation of decks for people to try every week. Want a totally fun experience? Get a friend when the Rift War deck is available. Two opposite decks of forty 'Add a Random CArd to you Hand' makes deck games that can be insane. This is a great game for people who want a legit Trading Card Game with the unique mechanics, this is not a game for people who want a totally free or a pay to win game			"

												Just like most other freemium games, they make it a slog unless you pay them money.  You make 50 creds if you lose a game and 15 cards cost about 1500 creds.  Not to mention a draw deck runs around 25000.  Game is fun though.  No really, if you want to drop money on this game go for it.  But a casual player can't play this at all and progress.			"

												This game has a nice design to the cards and you could see animations for the cards which makes them feel more alive. There are several different factions with their own play styles. You can earn some cards of the factions by playing the campaign mode but the negative here is that what can you do with those cards when there's no matches to play with against other people? I tried to look for a match but the status is forever ""looking for game""... with some flashes of an icon but no matches ever come up. So the replay value after the campaign mode is questionable. This makes me wonder how people actually play the ranked matches.. or maybe most of the people playing just play in ranked matches, making casual matches a non-existent thing. Also the people in chat aren't helpful as they just chat amongst themselves and ignore anyone else. So overall the art design of the cards are nice and interesting and game-play is fun. But not being able to find any matches with other people is the negative for this game.			"

												If you like TCGs then you should definitely check this one out. Beautiful, animated artwork is a great touch. Gameplay is fairly intuitive and basic, however there are tons of rules that need to be learned. Just the right amount of challenging without it feeling unfair. I really like that any deck is fair game; ie. there are no go-to decks that are a guaranteed win. The more you play and unlock achievements (in game, not steam) you get more cards so it doesn't feel pay2win. There is a store available just like any other free to play game where you can buy booster packs, decks, and aethetic changes such as icons, card backs, and battlefields (the area in which the cards are played). All can be purchased with money or points you accumulate from playing. Although, between the ability to buy cards and decks with points, and being able to trade with others- you should be able to make any deck you desire without spending a cent.			"

												I'm not playing this for long but i was suprised how much of a copy of MTG it seems to be, positively. Surely it looks different but if you know MTG well enough you will notice that its basically the same with slight changes. You will declare attackers and defenders aswell, just not in the form of tapping but in the form of moving the cards to specific areas. Cast creatures cant be moved to any of those areas instead they are resting in the Support area whey they cant attack or block.The biggest Changes to MTG are:No mana cards - You get +1 Mana every turnMana is colorlessPlayers make their moves at the same timeMonster HP does not reset at the end of the turnAnd the most weirdest part, 1 Monster can block every attacking Monster if it has enough HP and propably destroy every attacker.So basically it feels like a slightly easier MTG and fans, just like me, could enjoy it.

												A game that can actually burn time without you noticing it. Would actually give it a high rating, were it not for the large gap between old and new players. Although basic cards can be received from playing the campaign and finishing quests, they are not enough to be able to compete with the higher level/older players. This becomes a bigger problem due to a seemingly broken matchmaking system. It's either a few players are playing or bad matchmaking since a player can get paired up with a high-ranking/veteran player, which can demoralize a player.Sure you can say that when playing the game more, you earn in-game currency to buy booster packs/decks, but it is not enough to actually bring the new player to compete or at least have a chance. For example, a VICTORY gives only 150 IP tops but not guaranteed, while a booster pack costs 5250 IP, which means a required minimum of 35 wins. Decks, on the other hand, cost 12,950 IP, which reuires a minimum of 87 wins with maximum IP gained. Considering loses only give ~50 IP and new players rarely having good cards, it makes the game into a grind of a sort. Of course, there is the last resort of actually purchasing cards with real money for those who want to support the game. With the low amount of IP gained per match and expensive cost of card packs/decks, the game seems to tell players to ""buy or suffer grind.""I'd recommend the game since it shows promise, but due to the current system it may dismay some players.

												This is a great game.  I've always loved TCG's (mostly MTG and Yugioh back in the day) and they were fun but I've always known that they could be done better on a computer.  An online digital card game can do so many things that a physical TCG can't (like animated cards, auto match-making, zero rule disputes) and Infinity Wars totally nails it.  If you've ever played MTGO *shudder* then you'll be dumbfounded by how poor an it is in comparison to IW.   Solid excecution aside, Infinity Wars also succeeds on the artwork side of things.  Any collector/player would probably agree that card art is an important part of getting involved with these games.  The artists for IW know what they're doing.  The cards look fantastic and they're animated to boot.  It's dark/gritty comic-book feel and just looks awesome.  Finally, and most importantly, we have gameplay.  Here is where I think the game should really take off.  It's completely original and operates totally different from any TCG I've ever playeed.  One of the most interesting things about it (going back to what a digital game can do that a physical one can't) is that people plan and execute their turns simultaneously.  Nobody gets to go ""first"" and you're generally not having to deal with a lot of the annoying ""priority"" issues that you find in games like MTG.  This completely changes the dynamics and tempo of the gameplay and it's a lot of fun.  I would recommend anyone who likes TCG's to try this out.  It's free to start and you can actually get a lot of gaming in without buying anything.  So far I've spent about $25 and I'm holding my own in the ranked queues pretty well.			"

It's pretty easy to earn lots of cards in the campaign mode for the most part . BUT all of these cards are not tradeable . The only ones that are tradeable are the ones you spend real cash to purchase . The PVP is pretty tough therefore , but I have gotten a lot of entertainment just playing against AI so far .			"

												Please note that I haven't played this game for a long time; it's just my first impressions.This Trading Card Game is quite fun.Gameplay:4/5It requires lots of tactical and strategical thinking. For example, when to play good cards or when to not. That's just one of many scenarios where thinking is required. However, it gets complicated at times. The time for a match can really vary. Also you can train offline if it is needed.Environment:3.5/5The visuals are cool with all the animated cards. The video and the audio gets very repetitive through a game.Controls:4/5The drag-and-drop-your-cards-onto-the-battlefront system isn't hard to master. However, it is pretty unwieldy.Replayability and Dev Support:5/5The game constantly keeps you playing with many cards to collect. Also the developers give you free cards daily. The devs listen to anything you have to say, and they constantly release new updates.Overall8/10Great game, definitely recomended.			"

												The Game is fun and has a number of cards,however half of the cards your gonna get are probably not going to be tradable,next you can buy card decks (with IRL money) which are garaunteed this ultra card or this rare,however all cards are obtainable through several ways.Now if the game had more card variety, and wasnt based of getting better cards there would be a improvement.The game has to restrict you however of using a large variety of cards with something I call the 'loyalty' system,where basically if your commander(s) (unit cards that are garaunteed for you to have (theres a commander panel) with a max of 3, where if you have a commander for this faction you get 1 'loyalty'(my own term) cards which are relatively weak,but if you get 2 commanders of one faction you get cards of that faction that may need 2 'loyalty' which are pretty strong,now once you have 3 commanders for 1 faction, you can get any card for that faction.THe thing with card variety in Infinity Wars is that you pretty much are limited to have a really weak variety deck or a single play style strong deck, which severely effects deck variety.A alternative with this is to add more commanders or make less dependency on commanders.Strong cards cost alot of resources (a thing which lets you use unit cards,spells,or alternative ways to spend resources which effect the game,resource is increased by 1 every turn and it is completely replenished each turn) to prevent it from being used too early in the game,and so that the game isnt based off just whoevers gets a better draw.The game is good but doesnt have enough cards and deck variety at the moment so I rate this game 7.5/10 "

								SO let me start with I wasn't even looking for a game like this. I was looking through teh F2P games not really seeing anything worthwhile. I saw this game and was immediatly interested because I had been playing Magic 2012 and 2015 before and I wanted to try some new TCG that was on steam. I downloaded the game (which was super short) and booted it up. I didnt know I had to make an account but it was ez pz. Then I played the tutorial, which was fast and simple and easy to understand. The game is very different from other TCGs but it's an easy concept to grasp. I started playing more and more and got stuck on one campaign and started another one. Now Im hlafway through all the campaigns or more and I have enough cards to build really any deck type I desire, and that was just with a small amount of time playing. I reccomend this game to anyone wanting a new TCG experience and with some awesome looking cards. The animations are sick and the game is awesome in general! Get it nao!			"

								Infinity Wars is probably the best virtual trading card game on the market. If your thinking of getting magic 2014, scrap that, its a♥♥♥♥♥♥game, get Infinity Wars. Not only is this game top of the ranks for gameplay and design, but its free! While most free to play games have pay to win mechanics as a near requirment, Sun God and I can comfotably cruise through the game without paying  cent. It is still in beta though, so bugs can be expected.9.4/10 Worth every nonexisting cent.			"

												I haven't played any card games in a while but I'd definitely have to reccomend this one, the gameplay is pretty well balanced. And games tend to be fast paced but still incredibly engaging, The card art is very nice and the factions are varied and interesting, all with different playstyles. They've got a very nice FTP system as well. You're able to obtain every card in the game without paying any real currency, In game money is used to buy booster packs while premium currency can be used to buy additional ""starter decks"" (which free players can obtain through playing a factions campaign). As well as different aesthetic card backs or playing fields. There are many gameplay options, including mixed decks, and a drafting mode called a rift run in which you're given a choice of 4 cards at a time to build a 40 card deck and compete against other players doing the same.Overall 10/10 cardgame very fun.

												Lets start off by saying this def. is NOT a pay to win game.Its a pretty alright card game that features a campaign (Protip: Playing the campaign alone rewards you with several decks and bonus cards and all that good good♥♥♥♥♥♥It features pretty alright online play, tho you might get matched up with people who spend a good hour+ thinking up a deck and a strategy to go behind the deck.If you like card games, I'd reccomend this.If you don't like card games, get the crap out of this games page and go find something else.Also, playing the Merged Decks multiplayer match option is quite fun.10/10 would reccomend.

												+Pros~Decent campaigns~Not a Pay 2 Play, getting the cards is quite easy not to mention the free daily log-in bonus card~Rift runs are quite challenging (in the fun sort of way not the bash my head in with a pry-bar kind).~Trial by error, you make mistakes and you learn from them.(Even if you lose a match you dont lose money but gain it , you just dont gain exp).~The Dev's are on every day available for questioning.-Cons~The tutorial doesnt really explain too much, (points you in the right direction and tosses you in the deep end). ~The trading is a tad confusing, mostly giving you a link to a (un?)offical website.Overall I would definently sugest this game to any fan of Cards (MtG or otherwise)			"

												 This game is totally playable for free. Having grown up playing MTG this game does things you cannot do with phyical cards. There is no banned or restricted lists to look through like MTG, if a card was way too overpowered it can be adjusted with a patch. The card animations are beautiful, but the best part I like is having both players plan their turn at the same time unlike physical card games. Totally worth trying this game out, even if you have never played a card game.			"

												As with any card game, there's ins and outs to know for mastery of a game, and with simultaneous turns and a rather fun deck building system, this game may heavily appeal to some players.However, as of right now, I wouldn't recommend this game. The game itself isn't bad by any means, it simply hasn't grown enough, and feels as if it still needs to establish itself. Different paths for different factions are available, but at the same time it's readily apparent that some vastly outclass others, and not enough options as of yet exist to balance that out in a truly feasible way. Many times the recommended counters can alter the structure of a planned build too far to have remained true to the original intent, limiting the truly 'good' builds. On the other side, being able to mix and match factions can be rather fun, and I've enjoyed being creative, as well as playing against other creative builds, even if it's clear that one is stronger using aforementioned faction paths. Utilizing commander abilities also added a rather nice edge to the game, swinging games from victory to loss (unless playing against verore since they can just kill them outright, which sadly happens frequently). It adds a stable foundation to your builds, and enhances synergy. Along the same line, being able to swap your resources for drawing cards, swapping cards, and increasing resource cap can also help players stay in the lead or bounce back, even when seemingly out of any other options, as when given a bad hand.So overall, I'll be looking to come back to this game in the future, but not right now.

												I love the factions and the design (animated cards,  combat systems,  command zone function) but it takes way too long to earn XP and I've been trying to crack level 10 for weeks so I can finally get a game on the ranked PvP. Rift Run is an awesome concept but I've only been able to play once due to heavy play cost. Finally, getting new cards every day is really cool, but if its gonna be the same measly abilities or pawn-style characters, I lose interest. Spice it up with more uniques and tank-style characters/mind bending abilities. Overall great game a job well done, looking forward to updates!			"

												Infinity Wars is, for me, one of the best TCG's out there. Most may argue that it's not as good as MTG but still, compared to most other popular card games... *ahem*  Hearthstone  *ahem* it get's the golden medal.One of IW's main feature is the ""simultaneous turn* mechanic. Both players have about a minute or so to plan out their turns. When they are done, the cards are played out simultaniously. This feature might seem pointless just by itself, but in conjuction with IW's multiple zones, it makes the game a ton of fun. It adds a new element to the genre, the element of  Bluffing  and  Prediction. Here's an example on how this works: The Assault and Defense Zones are the Battlefield, The Support Zone though is not part of the Battlefield. Most cards are useless if they sit on the Support. Now here's where it gets interesting. Many cards target specific zones. Most ""kill"" cards ,for example, target cards on the Battlefield. If the targeted card is moved outside of the Battlefield the turn the ""kill"" card is played, it has no effect and is thrown to the used pile. Players can predict such cards or even try to waste them by bluffing (ex. playing a strong character but not moving it to the Battlefield).  This adds huge amount of strategy and depth to the game. Not only does it make it very interesting but it limits the cards' power, a player with a great mindset will easily outplay his opponent even if his cards are much inferior.Another small positive is that every card is animated. Some may have a very simple animation , like a character moving as he breaths heavily, while others can have up to 5 wooping seconds of animation. In addition, the devs are pretty generous towards new-comers. Cards can be earned very easily and most cards are balanced. Not to mention the community if pretty friendly and welcoming. The only negatives are the bugs, but still the devs are constantly working towards removing them.  It's a must-try if you are a TCG fan!  "

			A collectible card game, free-to-play, locatable on Steam. Showcasing what I like about it, and a quick game-and-a-half play example.		

This game's fun. I highly recommend playing through all the training, academy missions, and the single-player campaign. Good free way to get a solid starting understanding of the game and a good untradable library. And probably enough free points to buy some extra cards.Obvious question with any F2P is if it's P2W. You can buy card boosters with real money. And with fake money. The only thing you can't buy with the fake points are... cosmetic. Different avatars, card backs, particle effects... and I think one deck of the oldest cards. I remember playing Magic in high school. One kid had a lot more money than sense. Mox everything. Multicolored lands. I had a beginners deck a card shoppe had assembled as a way to repackage a lot of low-value cards. I beat that rich kid's pants off every time. Scrib sprites make life better.Now, more relevant, this game has some good ways around that problem. The weekly decks are often quite potent. But there's also several game modes. Infinite (anything goes, including star trek cards); Core (standard deckbuilding rules apply); Merged (both players cards shuffled together into one stack of chaos.); and Pauper (common and uncommon cards ONLY)That's without even looking at the draft game, which is cheap and can be entered with free points. Ranked play could be cheesed, but the only rewards there are cosmetic. And ego.And you can punch a few AI opponents when you have the itch.			"

												This is an amazing game for complex strategy. The differences between each deck and how you play them can really stand out. The only thing is that it is very tiring to earn cards. You will want to refer a friend and play with them alot, since you get rewards after every match or two. Another way is to go far enough into the campaign that you get a deck from each type, allowing you to get a fill for which type you wil invest in and learn, especially since oyu will have a ton of time between playing a deck, and buying one. Besides that its fun to play and you will experience brutal losses and clutch wins.			"

												Sooo...lets start with yeah its a f2p tcg, people who put money in have an advantage, kinda how those games work. That being said I've put nothing in and spent 6 hours or so playing and here are my thoughtsArtwork: Not MTG lvl, but really that'd be asking a lot from a non wizard TCG so fairly standard but lots of use of colors, its nice.Card spending: Its more streamlined than MTG, hell everything is and yes the review is gonna go around MTG as sort of the top of TCG...why...well because it is and if you think otherwise, you're most likely wrong. No mana to tap, get resources which increase per turn, spend them to summon cards, magic, abilitiesCard range: Pretty normal variety: Creatures, abilities, location, artifacts sooooo yeah normalDepth of Game: I'd rank it above Hearthstone which to me is about as casual you get without the game being a bore and lets say Yugioh. There is enough variety and ability to make mixed decks and them be functional (often better) and some strategy based on who you are playing.Generals: So purity is a deciding factor on generals, some cards require two gens from that card type, some 1, some all 3 gens must be of that type this both limits and creates variety in gameplay as the gens you pick can have a huge impact on ramping up bigger high dmg cardsWhere the game excels? Draft mode, which is one of two modes players get ranked; which is the most just system of ranking possible, the draft mode however is slow as frak to set up due to load times and revamps due to crap generals. But money doesn't matter in draft, it won't help you win so balanced pvp existing in a computer TCG? Yeah that's a major win in my bookOh rights: HP and Moral, two ways to win/lose. If either (both start at 100) hit zero its game over, but unlike many games where zero cards in deck means gameover Infinity War lets you keep playing with a ""dead"" deck for a lose of 10 morale per turn. Shot clock which frankly not a bad way to manage itLacks: A decent RFP, its there and its okay but it feels really limited and return from graveyard is barely there at all, more fill the grave then empty it			"

												While I believe the game is great fun, and offers lots of strategy and play variety, there was one thing I couldn't get past. It was the fact that 2 or 3 factions were vastly overpowered. I found myself using a faction whose strategy interested me, only to be crushed by people playing the OP factions. Even the designers know they're OP cause in the campaign, you frequently go against these factions and not much else. If you can look past this, you definately play this game. If you can't this isn't for you.			"

												I'm going to start of saying I still enjoy this game somewhat, its a nice free online trading card game once you get past the BS.Now to the BS i mentioned, and the reason I would not recommend this game to my duelist friends.This is not just a TCG, its an RPG of sorts. You start out in Campaign Mode and must progress through your prefered faction's story to gain new cards of that faction and to gain experience to level up.You cannot bypass the campaign, you must play it until you are at least level 3.I thought this was all fine and dandy until I realized something, you cannot use custom decks in campaign mode. You start with the same exact cards in the same exact order. So the chances are quite high you will load into a losing situation and you will not be able to alter that fate untill you play another faction's campaign and hope for the best.TL;DR The game does not allow custom decks in mandetory campaign mode, for a trading card game this is not acceptible.

												Most fun I've had in a CCG for ages.  Very friendly towards those that want a genuine Free To Play game - playing through the single player campaign will give you plenty of cards to start building decks to play with.  There's also decent free to play decks that work quite well and are fun to play while you're amassing your collection.  Online player base is young but growing, and the strategies that develop for shifting cards between different zones can get very entertaining and intense.  I've scraped out a win a couple of times with 1 out of 100 health left.  For newbies, just play through the single player stuff until it's done/boring and then build a deck and see where it takes you.  Good luck, and have fun!			"

												Updated review after many months away.Same story as in the early access. Lots and lots of potential here. It just oozes it everywhere. However there are 3 big things that made me uninstall this for the last time.1. Most importantly is bugs. Bugs everywhere. I have lost so many matches that I actually won because the game froze and I was forced to quit out. Not to mention endless animation loops that force you to quit. also there are constant disconnects mid match. This is crippling in rift running where you only get 3 shots and your done. When you have a killer deck and end up losing it because bugs force restarts then it really kills your joy.2. Booster packs take foreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeever to earn once your boosted xp from low levels goes away. you get 170-350 currency for losing/winning. a booster costs 5250. as you can see you need a lot of wins or even more combinations of losses and wins to get 15 cards. There is trading but no auction house which this game desperately needs. 15+ wins for one booster might be tolerable assuming you win all matches except for problem 3.3. The community is very very very veeeeeeeeery small. I have sat in queues for unranked or ranked for 30-90 minutes with no matches. If you play at the peak hours its tolerable, but god forbid you want to play on non peak times. There just isn't a large enough player base for a pvp focused game. Even hex, duels of champions, and sol forge have larger player bases. Another consequence of the small player base is you are much more likely to get constantly steam rolled by the people that can dump hundreds and even for some thousands into this game.			"

								If you'r a fan of TCG's, this one is a must to try.the game is quite complex and tactical. The game actually allows you to build decks around distinct tactics you may think of, and each group has a istinct playstyle.Building a proper deck and learning to anticipate your opponents moves is essential.Dont be put off by the initial campaign and challenges, which at times are a bits silly and frustrating puzzles with pre determined cards. Once you get to building your own decks and playing other players it realy is a good card game.Completing the campaigns (one for each faction) gives you a decent set of cards to start building your own decks with.While it takes quite a few games to gather enough game credits to buy a (15 card) booster - this takes between 35 (all wins) and 70 (all losses) pvp games - you get a decent amount of (15 card) boosters by leveling up, comleting some achievements, and sometimes even for just logging in that day. giving you a good amount of cards to build your decks with reasonably fast.The only limiting factor of the cards not obtained through premium or game credits is that they cannot be traded to other players.The only thing limited to premium credits are some cosmetic things like different card backs or battlefield visuals, everything that matters for gameplay can be obtained through playing the game.

												Pros:I enjoy the tutorial system in this game. Rather than having one session to cram all the knowledge you need, you are given a set of books, each focusing on one aspect of the game.The simultaneous/initiative action mechanic is a unique way to play, allowing players to create a strategy, lock it in, and see what the opponent decided to do with the same information you had.There are 8 different factions and you can use up to 3 different factions when making a deck. Each one is distinctive, but chances are you will latch onto one that fits your playstyle.The animated cards are enjoyable to watch and really brings life to the game.Cons:The game is a little buggy, with a few text descriptions missing, forcing you to guess what is going on, but it does not derail from the game experience.The lore is absolute crap and they stole a Star Wars quote and put it as flavor text for one of their cards.Getting daily rewards is a little unclear, and booster packs tend to give you cards you already have, but I guess that's expected.

												as far as free to play CCG's go i can reccomend this one.  it does an excellent job of easing you into the gameplay and mechanics, with the single play experience offering difficult challenges and rewarding you with new cards to play with.  you get bonus cards just for logging in daily.  the game play structure is rich and rewarding, and i feel you can play effectivly without feeling forced to buy cards.  definitely a plus.  the animated card backgrounds are simple, but add to the feel of the game, and some of the flavor text is very... flavorful. :)  try this out if youve ever been a fan of CCG's like magic or vampire or netrunner or yugioh			"

												Great game, very deep strategic decisions to be made, very complex deck building and it's more than just a TCG going digital, I don't see, how you would have fun with this on a tabletop as there are very many things to keep track of. Highly recommended!!!Update:I wish, I could give a ""partially recommended"". What I wrote above still stands, but I have to say, after a while, you find yourself either compelled to spend a lot of money to get the cards you need or to spend a lot of time to try and trade them, whereas you have dozens of surplus copies of useless cards rotting in your account. In short: the trade system sucks! You look for single cards and hope to find someone offering it for the stuff you have. Why not do an interim resource for which you can trade in your surplus cards to buy cards you need directly? Hearthstone (which I deem the way less interesting game) does it, Faeria (which is very nice, but not as good as IW) does it. What's the problem then? Hopefully someone looks into this, because the game itself is still my favourite digital TCG!!!			"

												Oh boy...where to begin. For starters, i love this game, i love the concept, i love the art, i love the soundtrack, and the game it self is very fun. But, the game has serious balence issues. Like, if i'm losing, i have no way to come back. And if i'm on a roll and thinking for once i might win. NOPE, gg, nuked or disabled and i can't do anything about it. And when i go to the community about it, guess what? Rudeness on a pretty big scale. So, instead of asking for help, i'll just go ♥♥♥♥ my self. Oh, i'm sorry that was a cuss word. I'll go ""Puffy"" my self. Seriously though, nothing is being done about the balence issue and the rude community and i've had it. #♥♥♥♥ThisGame. It's been fun, but i'm out for good. Only get into this game if you want the community to call you out.			"

												+Pros~Decent campaigns~Not a Pay 2 Play, getting the cards is quite easy not to mention the free daily log-in bonus card~Rift runs are quite challenging (in the fun sort of way not the bash my head in with a pry-bar kind).~Trial by error, you make mistakes and you learn from them.(Even if you lose a match you dont lose money but gain it , you just dont gain exp).~The Dev's are on every day available for questioning.-Cons~The tutorial doesnt really explain too much, (points you in the right direction and tosses you in the deep end). ~The trading is a tad confusing, mostly giving you a link to a (un?)offical website.Overall I would definently sugest this game to any fan of Cards (MtG or otherwise)			"

												Please note that I haven't played this game for a long time; it's just my first impressions.This Trading Card Game is quite fun.Gameplay:4/5It requires lots of tactical and strategical thinking. For example, when to play good cards or when to not. That's just one of many scenarios where thinking is required. However, it gets complicated at times. The time for a match can really vary. Also you can train offline if it is needed.Environment:3.5/5The visuals are cool with all the animated cards. The video and the audio gets very repetitive through a game.Controls:4/5The drag-and-drop-your-cards-onto-the-battlefront system isn't hard to master. However, it is pretty unwieldy.Replayability and Dev Support:5/5The game constantly keeps you playing with many cards to collect. Also the developers give you free cards daily. The devs listen to anything you have to say, and they constantly release new updates.Overall8/10Great game, definitely recomended.			"

												Good card game. One of best BUT:A LOT of bugs.- Crashing too often. Once after completing quest once when editing deck (changes are lost).- Gaining cards is simple and fast but to be honest i barely recognize most of them and have no idea where ive got them.- Loading time. Game is ""thinking"" on everything that should appear immidiately.- Factions icons tells me nothing i need to play a lot of games to see difference between cards and what faction they belongs to.Reasuming:You can learn everything with time but most of it takes ""loading"" of unkown things and restarting game after it crashes over and over.

I used to be a big fan of yu-gi-oh and a little into magic (never played but I've watched plenty of my friends.  And I have to say that even though I've only played this for a little amount of time this card game is decent and I'm sure I will like it even more as I progress and unlock more cards to create better decks.  I can't wait to unlock PVP as I think going up against another person will be a blast WIN/LOSE.  But for anyone looking for a card game to play I think your search should end here.			"

What i really like about the game is the artstyle and the fact that the cards are animated.

It's pretty easy to earn lots of cards in the campaign mode for the most part . BUT all of these cards are not tradeable . The only ones that are tradeable are the ones you spend real cash to purchase . The PVP is pretty tough therefore , but I have gotten a lot of entertainment just playing against AI so far .			"

												I'm not playing this for long but i was suprised how much of a copy of MTG it seems to be, positively. Surely it looks different but if you know MTG well enough you will notice that its basically the same with slight changes. You will declare attackers and defenders aswell, just not in the form of tapping but in the form of moving the cards to specific areas. Cast creatures cant be moved to any of those areas instead they are resting in the Support area whey they cant attack or block.The biggest Changes to MTG are:No mana cards - You get +1 Mana every turnMana is colorlessPlayers make their moves at the same timeMonster HP does not reset at the end of the turnAnd the most weirdest part, 1 Monster can block every attacking Monster if it has enough HP and propably destroy every attacker.So basically it feels like a slightly easier MTG and fans, just like me, could enjoy it.

												From reading a few reviews I was a little hesitant about downloading this game, but I was like ""what the heck it's free"" so I decided to give it a chance.  From the begining the campaign was pretty easy and the game gives you free starter decks for compleating each challange. Now the real test challenge is compeating against others and trying to figure out a good card set up and strategy with what you have in your hand. The player matchmaking in not very balaced, but I do enjoy playing more advanced players because I can get a feel for how they play the game and what factions seem to work well together. All in all it's a good game that takes a bit of patience and persistance to get get better and start winning against others.			"

												What can i say about Infinity wars? Well to be honest in my opinon this game has far out reached most CCGs out there are far as well..... the whole game! it has a very unique play style compared to most CCGs does very frequent updates (the most recent is the reward system where you can get ip and LP as well as a full booster pack and boosts ) everyday you get rewards when you log on and it forces you to think and stadegize more so than any CCG or TCG ive seen!!! where a starter deck is basically just that not over powered to where people who make good actual decks get ♥♥♥♥ed over by a stupid common deck that everyone has and can get. so all you newbies who downrate this game bc you cant think without the game holding your hand giiving you everything from the start this game is not for you.Now on the other hand it has its flaws as well like every game in existance. it frequently lags here and there like loading the batlle sequence or let alone loading the whole match between 2 people. it also matches you up poorly and i mean poorly where a low level  is paired with someone whos level 20 or higher sometimes instaed of matching someone based off of level and or how well your gaming skills are at your current state. alsoa s a blow to some newbies they are confused as to how to use certain ablities of cards plus let alone how it works need to work on this as its very unforgiving but to be honest the best thing that i can say about this game is the fact that theres a TRADING SYSTEM !!!!!!!! yes this is the only game in existance of all CCGs ive seen and played wher ethey incorperated a trading system in their game for players to trade cards and actually functions properly !!!! unlike MTG especially ones i have plaed never had a trading system incorped in them at all once so ever. this is a major awesome PLUS!!!my rating would be 9/10 a msut play for anyone whos crazy about TCGs let alone CCGs "

												Very Fun card game revolving around the deck you build, there are almost unlimited choices you can make with the decks that are already given to you right when you enter.The decks that you build require you to have a minimum of 40 cards but its maximum is unlimited, you can have anyamount of cards if you have the requirements for them to be in your deck. Some people say its a Pay To Play, but the game it self rewards you with cards, booster packs, and the 2 types of points used to buy the booster packs or even Deck packs for just logging in for a few days straight!There are 3 ways you can win if you choose to play this game, by reducing your opponents health from 100 to 0, or doing the same with there Moral from 100 to 0, or by accomplishing the requirements from certian cards that you play when you have them in your hand. And unlike Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering, this game has alot more original and creative aspects to a card game that i have seen. There is a market DURING the games you play to Draw a card, Swap a card out for a random one, or To increase the Maximun resource counter you have. There is even a commander out post for 3 creature cards of your choice (which can be immediatly played if you have the resources) and thoese creatures can have amsome abilities, like "" Pay 2, Summon a 3/2 minion in to your safe zone"". Most creature and character cards have that awsome aspect to them that make this game alittle bit complicated but still fun in the end.To just simplify, its a really fun game that is original and should have some time in the spotlight for its amazing gaming concepts.

												Really a surprisingly good game.It has a lot of mechanics that makes the game very interesting. Both players play their turn at the same time, there is a stat called morale that works a bit like health but provides a different win condition and there are 3 different ""zones"" on the battlefield that impact the game differently. It's not Pay 2 win and it's a lot of fun! If I had to include any downside it would be the feel that the board can get a bit cluttered with intense amounts of units but that doesn't really matter, I would still recommend this game to anyone!(edited)			"

								If you'r a fan of TCG's, this one is a must to try.the game is quite complex and tactical. The game actually allows you to build decks around distinct tactics you may think of, and each group has a istinct playstyle.Building a proper deck and learning to anticipate your opponents moves is essential.Dont be put off by the initial campaign and challenges, which at times are a bits silly and frustrating puzzles with pre determined cards. Once you get to building your own decks and playing other players it realy is a good card game.Completing the campaigns (one for each faction) gives you a decent set of cards to start building your own decks with.While it takes quite a few games to gather enough game credits to buy a (15 card) booster - this takes between 35 (all wins) and 70 (all losses) pvp games - you get a decent amount of (15 card) boosters by leveling up, comleting some achievements, and sometimes even for just logging in that day. giving you a good amount of cards to build your decks with reasonably fast.The only limiting factor of the cards not obtained through premium or game credits is that they cannot be traded to other players.The only thing limited to premium credits are some cosmetic things like different card backs or battlefield visuals, everything that matters for gameplay can be obtained through playing the game.

												Been looking for a new card game to get into and after stumbling upon this I think my search is over.  I used to be a big fan of yu-gi-oh and a little into magic (never played but I've watched plenty of my friends.  And I have to say that even though I've only played this for a little amount of time this card game is decent and I'm sure I will like it even more as I progress and unlock more cards to create better decks.  I can't wait to unlock PVP as I think going up against another person will be a blast WIN/LOSE.  But for anyone looking for a card game to play I think your search should end here.			"

												I really want to like this game…However the amount of broken combos is crazy. And trust me there are plenty of people who will use them. My opinion is it will take months if not years to clean up the amount of broken card combinations that will destroy a well thought out deck. It really gets down to just studying the cards, and creating a deck to exploit combos and you will win…simple as that. The game is not pay to win, and it is fun initially, until you start running into said players and decks mentioned above. When you point out this fact to the players utilizing these types of combos/decks, a simple “lol” is the typical response. The elitist I have run into don’t have any desire to admit their deck is broken, instead to them it’s perfectly legit. The Game should have started with a far more simplified game play and stuck with an overall tactical approach to winning a battle... instead of the current game mechanics are gather a few cards and exploit said combo…then gg. They have a massive uphill battle to try an undo this as the current inventory of cards/abilities/clans/etc are endless…as soon as one exploit if finally exposed and corrected two more will pop up. A CCG should start simple and small and work towards complex and large…this game did the opposite. So if you want to take the time and exploit some broken card combos, then this game is for you.For now I’m changing my negative to a positive. After playing several more hours I have determined that a lot of the broken combos I stated in my earlier review can be countered. However I do think there are some cards and combos that are broken and too powerful. For now I am enjoying the game again, but there is a huge learning curve with the vast amount of cards, so unless you are willing to dedicate some serious time this is not a game for you. This is without a doubt NOT a PAY to Win! And I love that! More to come.Yea, too many broke cards and combos...but game could be good after some major tweaks.			"

												Let me start out by saying that I love CCG games.  Infinity Wars has not dissappointed but for me it leaves a little to be desired.  I know it is out of the norm that someone who enjoys playing CCG games prefers to strictly play offline against the AI, but that is me.  With that being said, if you're looking for a type of review based on the online PvP of the game you won't find it here.On that note, I'll go over the good features of the game.  I love the illustrations and the variety of cards in themselves is great.  Also, the animation on EVERY card is a nice touch.  The cards are well-thought, mostly balanced with some Epic cards being game changers but in my opinion, thats the great thing about the CCG game.  The gameplay, process, and strategy that are involved is also very good.  Without getting into it too deep, you basically have your character cards, gear cards, location cards etc.  Your main goal is to destroy your enemies fortress by attacking with your characters.  A nice twist on this game however, is that each character has a listed morale.  Now if that creature dies, your faction loses that much morale.  Your starting fortress and morale bars start at 100 each.  If either reach 0 then you lose the game.  Like I said, just the basics as there are certain strategies to get you to that goal.  You can also completely customize your decks with cards awarded after receiving new booster packs after each level gained or through their online store for purchase.  I've played about 11 hours on this game so far and have not spent anything as of yet and have several Rare cards, 1 Epic, and 0 Legendaries at this point to give you an idea.  One major love of mine regarding the customization is that there are 3 slots for you to choose which faction you want in that slot.  You can assign a Commander for each one of those 3 slots, ensuring those cards are on the battlefield for you at game start.My only negative point with this game is that there really isn't any other mode for me to play other than ""Practice"".  And this mode only allows me to play against 4 specific decks with a rated difficulty.  Therefore, 11hrs in I'm getting a little bored.  Other than that, if you're into the online gaming then this might be for you as I feel like the gaming mechanics and overall replayability of the game is right on.			"

												Infinity wars is like other card games but combining all the good bits. it makes you think and use stratigic placeing of your cards.the money/IP earning system is a little slow but you can still have fun without a bunch of cash/IP. The Campaign is great bedcause you can do play several different campaign's that you get rewards for completeing like card packs,cards and money, and once you complete the entire campaign for thaqt raced you get teh starter deck for it. its fun ive spent a while in it and im going to continue playing i hope you give it a try.P.S sorry if i typed anything incorectly but this thing dosn't have auto-correct			"

												I'm not playing this for long but i was suprised how much of a copy of MTG it seems to be, positively. Surely it looks different but if you know MTG well enough you will notice that its basically the same with slight changes. You will declare attackers and defenders aswell, just not in the form of tapping but in the form of moving the cards to specific areas. Cast creatures cant be moved to any of those areas instead they are resting in the Support area whey they cant attack or block.The biggest Changes to MTG are:No mana cards - You get +1 Mana every turnMana is colorlessPlayers make their moves at the same timeMonster HP does not reset at the end of the turnAnd the most weirdest part, 1 Monster can block every attacking Monster if it has enough HP and propably destroy every attacker.So basically it feels like a slightly easier MTG and fans, just like me, could enjoy it.

												This is a great game.  I've always loved TCG's (mostly MTG and Yugioh back in the day) and they were fun but I've always known that they could be done better on a computer.  An online digital card game can do so many things that a physical TCG can't (like animated cards, auto match-making, zero rule disputes) and Infinity Wars totally nails it.  If you've ever played MTGO *shudder* then you'll be dumbfounded by how poor an it is in comparison to IW.   Solid excecution aside, Infinity Wars also succeeds on the artwork side of things.  Any collector/player would probably agree that card art is an important part of getting involved with these games.  The artists for IW know what they're doing.  The cards look fantastic and they're animated to boot.  It's dark/gritty comic-book feel and just looks awesome.  Finally, and most importantly, we have gameplay.  Here is where I think the game should really take off.  It's completely original and operates totally different from any TCG I've ever playeed.  One of the most interesting things about it (going back to what a digital game can do that a physical one can't) is that people plan and execute their turns simultaneously.  Nobody gets to go ""first"" and you're generally not having to deal with a lot of the annoying ""priority"" issues that you find in games like MTG.  This completely changes the dynamics and tempo of the gameplay and it's a lot of fun.  I would recommend anyone who likes TCG's to try this out.  It's free to start and you can actually get a lot of gaming in without buying anything.  So far I've spent about $25 and I'm holding my own in the ranked queues pretty well.			"

												Read this review first. Also, I started playing this game two weeks ago from the post date of 8/11/15, so everything I'm saying is current.This. Game. Is. *Awesome*.I played Magic The Gathering my entire childhood, MTG Online, WoW TCG, Hearthstone, and Hex, and they all pale in comparison. I've heard nonsense in these reviews ranging from matchmaking issues to.... ""ths game sux cuz not nuff dbl xp wkends"".... (seriously? lol)At the end of the day, TCG's (or CCG's *shrug*) are *all* about the cards, and mechanics of the game. This game is So much more fun, complex, and strategic than *any* other game in the genre, bar none. Anyone who tells you differently is lying, an idiot, or rage-quit because they lost their first battle and got angwy.I'm not just some fanboy. There are a couple of glitches, and from what I hear, there could be a better matchmaking system I guess (though I find I win a completely reasonable amount of matches, regardless of being new). However, the game itself just can't be beat. Try playing this game for a few days and going back to Hearthstone. Go ahead, I just did it. I was literally *bored* to tears. It doesn't have one tenth the depth or strategy that Infinity Wars has. It's just a fact, guys.The cards are *beautiful*, *all of them are animated*, and...you...can... *trade* with your friends... (or enemies, or strangers... whatever). For those of you who have actually played other online TCG's, I'm sure you can appreciate putting the 'T' back into the acronym. I don't know about you guys, but that was half of what it was about when I was a kid. There are *8* incredibly distinct and well-designed factions to choose from, each with their own goals, combos and strategies that make sense, and carry a personality of their own. You can *combine* them into a deck of your choosing, and the combinations really let your own deck designs shine. The game has 4 zones during play. One of which is the 'Commander' zone, which is a set of 3 characters of your choosing that start on the board from turn 1. While I, myself, found it a bit 'too much' when i first started, it's come to be one of the most amazing and distinguishing mechanics this game has to offer, bringing a new level of customization and gauranteed strategy to your deck.Don't listen to the nay-sayers. If you're here on this page because you're bored of what little Hearthstone has to offer, download this, and thank me later. "

												If you like TCGs then you should definitely check this one out. Beautiful, animated artwork is a great touch. Gameplay is fairly intuitive and basic, however there are tons of rules that need to be learned. Just the right amount of challenging without it feeling unfair. I really like that any deck is fair game; ie. there are no go-to decks that are a guaranteed win. The more you play and unlock achievements (in game, not steam) you get more cards so it doesn't feel pay2win. There is a store available just like any other free to play game where you can buy booster packs, decks, and aethetic changes such as icons, card backs, and battlefields (the area in which the cards are played). All can be purchased with money or points you accumulate from playing. Although, between the ability to buy cards and decks with points, and being able to trade with others- you should be able to make any deck you desire without spending a cent.			"

												Ok while I do enjoy TCG games, the problem I had with this one, was the longer I played it, the more it began to grind on, and the less I wanted to play it. I liked the campain mode, though it was really more of a short distration, it wasn't long enough for me, and the missions were pretty easy once you figured out what to do. Playing against the handful of AI  which used the same decks over and over again got simularly repative after awhile. As far as human vs human goes, I didn't try it, as I felt that with how difficult it was to gain cards without buying things with real money. That the decks I could make with just what few cards the game gave me through completing the campaine, wouldn't be able to compete against a human.			"

												A game that can actually burn time without you noticing it. Would actually give it a high rating, were it not for the large gap between old and new players. Although basic cards can be received from playing the campaign and finishing quests, they are not enough to be able to compete with the higher level/older players. This becomes a bigger problem due to a seemingly broken matchmaking system. It's either a few players are playing or bad matchmaking since a player can get paired up with a high-ranking/veteran player, which can demoralize a player.Sure you can say that when playing the game more, you earn in-game currency to buy booster packs/decks, but it is not enough to actually bring the new player to compete or at least have a chance. For example, a VICTORY gives only 150 IP tops but not guaranteed, while a booster pack costs 5250 IP, which means a required minimum of 35 wins. Decks, on the other hand, cost 12,950 IP, which reuires a minimum of 87 wins with maximum IP gained. Considering loses only give ~50 IP and new players rarely having good cards, it makes the game into a grind of a sort. Of course, there is the last resort of actually purchasing cards with real money for those who want to support the game. With the low amount of IP gained per match and expensive cost of card packs/decks, the game seems to tell players to ""buy or suffer grind.""I'd recommend the game since it shows promise, but due to the current system it may dismay some players.

Early Access Review
								Its a good game.On the topic of Digital TCG and it being pay2win I gotta say no.Well, the difference between good cards and common cards can often be pretty drastic.However - the game uses a system in which one has to declare 3 of your own cards to be commanders - and the difference between a good Deck and a bad One is often decided by how well these three synergize.Which is a strong point of the game, because grinding just 3 cards together who do synergize is absolutely possible by just playing the different Solo-Campaigns - ofcourse this relies quite a bit on luck.However i've experienced the Reward and Achievementystem of Infinity Wars to be really fair - the game awards you quite often with a series of cards or single ones. In just some days I had quite a lot of the rare cards of the game - however the turning point for me was just getting that one commander who could win me games by being good as a standalone and synergizing with pretty much every faction.Unlike games like Pox Nora - i appreciate it that the starterdecks you unlock via the different campaigns are freely adjustable and every card goes in to your collection - so one can build quite diverse decks from the getgo.The thing is - when I start games like this i want to build my own decks right from the start and play even games - you know: win some lose some. However the bad matchmaking (sometimes I wonder if there even IS a matchmaking - 'cause even as a beginner you will get thrown in against veteran players with badges all over your screen quite often) could make on believe this game is pay2win. But even if your cards and strategies where of the same strength - good players will own you any day in this. The game is quite skilldependent and the time you need to learn the basics even and when to play your cards, learning which faction your opponent is playing and therefore how it can react will be accompanied by loss after loss.However the animated cards are quite a funny feature and the art is good - nothing i really dig like the MTG-Artworks but good all around.I dont like about the game that there's no way to get rid of soulbound cards you have to many of. (Most Cards are limited to three per deck - however the game won't stop to hand you out the 20th copy of the same wealthy noble ever)The game is quite lively and the community is rather nice.By that I mean roughly half of your opponents won't react to chat whatsoever - a quarter will 'gg' but I had quite nice short chats with rest of the lot. No Flame, no trolling - quite harmonic.Anyone who likes digital TCG and wants to give this a try I'd recommend playing it for ten hours or so - that's when you'll mostly likely have enough experience with the game, grinded enough to have a nice collection of cards + the occasional gamemaker-cards so the diversity will unfold before you.

								SO let me start with I wasn't even looking for a game like this. I was looking through teh F2P games not really seeing anything worthwhile. I saw this game and was immediatly interested because I had been playing Magic 2012 and 2015 before and I wanted to try some new TCG that was on steam. I downloaded the game (which was super short) and booted it up. I didnt know I had to make an account but it was ez pz. Then I played the tutorial, which was fast and simple and easy to understand. The game is very different from other TCGs but it's an easy concept to grasp. I started playing more and more and got stuck on one campaign and started another one. Now Im hlafway through all the campaigns or more and I have enough cards to build really any deck type I desire, and that was just with a small amount of time playing. I reccomend this game to anyone wanting a new TCG experience and with some awesome looking cards. The animations are sick and the game is awesome in general! Get it nao!			"

								I was searching for a free-to-play TCG and tried it. Now I'm addicted to it. I love how you can earn every card just by leveling up which is really fun. The campaigns and the training is really challenging and got me hooked. I also like how the deck is fully customizable. Looking forward to new features.			"

												now dont get me wrong i like this game, it has its pros and its cons and from what ive seen most people like it, this game is like hearthstone combind with yugioh (exept you can have as many characters on the board as you want) cards cost resorce's (which is basicly mana) to use and is pretty easy to understand but like any card game hard to master, if i was to give this game a score from 1 to 10 i would give it a 6.5/10, and everycard in the game is animated which is pretty cool to look at, however this game does have problems, for one overseers are OVER POWERED AS HELL because they are litteraly nothing but flying units (flying means it can fly over ground units to attack your opponent) there are ways of stopping them but to far and few inbetween, costs for certain cards are (at times) to low and to high, (im NOT gonna list the cards because that would take to long) and match makeing can sometimes be a pain in the A S S hole, one thing that disapointed me was that the campaign wasnt voice acted, and i find that strange because the tutorial WAS voice acted and had some pretty bad A S S voices, this game is worth checking out and seeing if you like it (ITS FREE)			"

												I was going to say great things about this game but after playing for six hours and trying every stratergy i still ouldnt get past ertain campaigns, so where do i begin well ill say now that this is not a BAD GAME IT IS GOOD IN WAYs now to finish heres where it needs improving in my opinion....1: leveling up.... leveling up should be a fun task and the fact that it can take hours to level up really sucks what yous should do is give a little exp even if you lose it would make leveling up more fun....especially if your stuck for hours..2:the end of all levels is the same fire now if you beat the level or even just die it should always be somewhat unique its kinda-is boring seeing it all the time and makes the game more boring.3: when you play the cards that change the field it seems like you have put next to no effort making it presentable maybe adding a few 3D mushrooms on the board or something like that would make it much more appealing.4: the card animations should be abit more then the person standing there and a few flashes and bullet holes are seen should make it abit more appealing aka need more animation in it.5:the board is always the same and even looks the same with the field change maybe making the board look more unique in certain levels and change of colour should improve more ratings.6: The fact that you have illegal decks are stupid whatever you reate should be your deck and not classed as illegal as that is what makes so many games more fun beause the basis that others have to match stratergy level.7: i know yous will get there but maybe adding more cards may i suggest a few faction types: blood life(more for the males card design maybe black and green merged on the cards and the basis of mainly massive beasts), meadows legion(based mainly for females and allows vibrant bright colours to exsist and more girly characters), Xenu soilders ( based upon sci fi(more of a neutral based deck with aliens not monsters-well maybe a few feirce dragons wouldnt hurt, but deck mainly used as support with awesome upgrades for any monster), arch knights ( card basis_golden and white_ based more in the middle age times but with a sci fi approach would be amazing and different, more based on attack and countering) and last but not least the astral lights ( well balanced team but with more of a tactical approach and not purely based on strength_ card colours_light blue_white and red based more upon astral plain entities its something totally different and there be alot more players.... these are just a few i have made through thought.this is a good game but needs improvement i can see it soaring if your interested in more ideas please dont hesitate to message me and ill be happy to do surveys on your behalf as new things always need a for in the door also may i suggest one thing,,,, desighning a mini game based like chess but the ards you draw deturmin your players and have a dota sort of move ment effect then onece you get through the mini game you verse the boss in a card match....please dont hesitate to email danieledwardsen@gmail.com "

								I think its a breath of fresh air that utilizes the digital realm perfectly, ot incorporate moer intricate and interesting card game play features. In meaning, more complex formatts can be played without having ot teach the setup to much. Since its beta, I am sure multi table, head to head and a plethora of other types are sure ot come along. I would say I would leave magic ot the cards and infinity for the digital realm. It's a great game. There are some funny querks and it is working out its balancing but it in a eta stage. This also offers a great reward eco market for them now and later on for printable cards. Great Work. Your artists seem to have lots of fun.			"

Early Access Review
								Exciting and Frustrating.Exciting:  There are lots of different cards with different powers, and turns are played simultaneously, so there is lots of tension and excitement and surprises.  This plays very differently than other cards games in which matches have more of a sense of grinding them out and focussing on small advantages.  Another plus during the Beta is that you receive lots of free cards (including one per day for simply logging in), so if this game catches your interest you might as well download it and start collecting free cards in case you like it.Frustrating:  There are certain uber cards and uber combos, most of which are rare.  And at least during the Beta, a majority of the players I encounter are long-time players with good collections.  Therefore, it is not uncommon during a match for a newer player to be totally outmatched by cards and tactics that you have no chance of countering.  My hope is that once the game is published there will be a large base of players so that newer players will mostly play against other newer players. Another frustration is that, at least as of this writing, there is no replay function, which means that sometimes effects will happen and you will have no idea how or what happened.  The company says that a replay feature will be added.			"

Takes bits and pieces without being a clone.Cons: 1: Somewhat buggy interface at times2: Balance is a little off going through campaign, some colors are challenging while the rest are rediculously easy. Summary: As someone who has been playing MtG for years and played hearthstone since early beta, this game is definitely good enough to warrant a play for any CCG fan. It's one of the best F2P ccg's out there and it's shop is very reasonable. Highly recommended.			"

												Infinity Wars is a TCG that reminds me of the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game.  Infinity Wars has several factions that each have their own play style.  The tech faction is about upgrading your units to hell and beyond with cards such as (GIVE THAT MAN A JETPACK!) and the ability to combine units, so you can take an unit w ith tons of defense and one with tons of attack, and make one super unit that will nuke the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything.  The tech zombie faction takes dead units and revives them to return them to the game.  The Star Trek faction (not even ♥♥♥♥ing kidding) takes your enemy's units and makes them join your side.  The flaming dawn uses incredibly excessive attack to destroy the enemy base before they can get set up.It seems that every card in the game can be gotten for free if you take enough time, so that's nice.  The game systems are taught through a tutorial, so I'll only speak about my favorite of which.  You have three cards as a sort of sidedeck.  The three cards you choose in this sidedeck will be in a special zone at the start of the game.  These are called your commanders.  They determine the faction of your deck.  If you use one flaming dawn, one tech, and one zombie, for instance, you can use the weakest cards of all of them.  If you use two flaming dawn and one tech, you can use the tier 2 cards of flaming dawn and the tier ones of tech.  If you have all flaming dawn, you can use the tier 3s of flaming dawn.  This system allows you to choose between specializing or mixing.  It also makes it easier to get started, as you don't need a LOT of cards from one faction, just 20-30 from three of your choice to have a deck.  (You start out with a fairly crappy deck of your choice, btw, which you should only use in merged play or pauper mode, and use the free weekly decks for normal gameplay.)There are three game types that I have unlocked so far.  Infinite, which is just use the decks as normal.  Merged, which mixes the two players decks together, so you can use the same cards as your opponent and be on an equal field.  And finally, pauper, which forces both players to use common and uncommon cards.Give it a try, you'll only regret it a little.			"

								Still has bugs and less than satisfying UI, it's a beta, but at its core it's the best digital ccg you can play right now in terms of mechanics. And unlike most digital ccgs, it actually has trading. The art is mostly dark/adult oriented and has character, and all the cards being animated is a nice touch. The simultaneous turn resolution makes it so you don't wait as long for your opponent to play, and adds an extra layer of psychological warfare and strategy to what is already a pretty complex game. This has the potential (keyword potential) to topple M:TG if the developers manage to stay afloat for long enough to polish everything, and I hope they do.In conclusion, I'd say that if you like CCGs and don't give this game a shot, you are crazy.

With more than one way to win and a simultaneous turn based system, this game got me. The fact that there is a campaign for each deck is awesome. The fact that there is a campaign at all is awesome. The fact that you're not forced to play online with other people is awesome. This game......Is awesome. Of course, it is in beta, and bugs are to be expected, but they're doing a great job and I highly suggest you try this game out.			"

I reccomend this game to anyone wanting a new TCG experience and with some awesome looking cards. The animations are sick and the game is awesome in general! Get it nao!			"

								IW is fun and accessible to the flexible gamer, but be prepared for a rocky user experience and an odd juxtaposition of content.Paying for advantage is an inseparable part of this genre.  However, IW does a very good job of giving new players and f2p'ers free decks and cards to play with.   If you get good, you can win cards and the in-game currency to buy card packs.  I didn't find the simultaneous turns clunky.  It's a relatively novel mechanic that is likely counter-intuitive to experienced card players.  As a dabbling TCG/CCG gamer, it wasn't any more challenging a mechanic than any other in the game.  This game is complex and a casual gamer should be prepared for tough play.My concerns about the game are bugs in the client and the dev teams ability to ever iron out bugs and implement features.   The client has always been very, very buggy and prone to all sorts of weird behavior, including desyncs between player clients!  I would caution potential spenders given the slow rate of development and the severity of some bugs.I am extremely skeptical about the integrity of a team that would create crossovers with well-established franchises before their own game is even officially released.  I'm sure Star Trek decks appeal to some players, but, frankly, it smacks of pandering and, to my eyes, belies confidence in their original content and IP.  More to the point, Star Trek hardly shares common thematic elements, beyond very broad themes common to almost any sci-fi/science fantasy setting.  The very inclusion is jarring to me.			"

												As someone who hasn't played a whole lot of card games before IW, I have to say it is an enjoyable game rewarding in equal ammount strategy, predicting your opponent and creativity in deck building. Even if just one of the three appeals to you, the game is worth a try, as even casual play is rewarding and the game is comparably (to the F2P standard) generous with its free rewards. You can get boosters for ingame currency and levelling up also grants you a free soulbound booster. Not to mention logging in and playing 3 games per day awards a free card each,At this point you might be wondering: will the game be worth a play if you want to stay free and not spend anything on it? The answer is yes, many of the most powerful and useful cards are of low rarity, with the exception of a few decks it is rare to see a deck filled with high rarity cards. This along with the ease of earning new ones and the ability to trade makes it fairly easy to get a decent deck running once you've gotten familiar with the game.As for negatives: the game has bugs, owing to the limitations of the developers. They vary in severity with an occasional desync bug even capable of ruining a game, others merely being a nuissance (naccurate card text, a button name giving an error message) or causing unexpected card interaction, although these cases seem the exception rather than a rule by my experience.All in all the game feels like an unpolished gem. It has a great core, fun gameplay, variety of choice in deck creation, but is held back by bugs and what seems to be a limitation of dev resources.			"

												This is a mixed review. I am no stranger to CCGs both digital and tangible (MTG, Yugioh, Hearthstone, now Infinity Wars) and have invested many hours and dollars into them over many years. It could be said with confidence that I enjoy them and understand advanced concepts within them. I was seeking an alternative to Hearthstone when I came across IW and gave it a shot as a free to play digital game with fully animated cards of generally good quality art. The core concepts were interesting, although the game does not do a totally adequate job explaining the functionality of all the various ""zones"" (nor is it uniform in their terminology as some cards refer to the ""assault"" zone as the ""attack"" zone) and it was only after several hours of play and deck building that i discovered the ""purity"" mechanic required to understand competant deck building. I also discovered some cards do not function entirely as written in the card text, but surely these complaints can be fixed via future patches. Overall I have had fun with IW. The campaign mode, while comprised of a very nonsensical plot, has some interesting stage puzzles to be solved, though some campaigns can be steamrolled via custom deck building that trivializes certain AI factions. The AI in general is rather poor, in some cases it plays cards to the support zone and then seems to forget they exist. In other cases it stays the course when death is inevitable rather than adapting its strategy. But CCGs are meant to be played against humans, so let's discuss that aspect.This is where my review turns sour. Match making is garbage. INB4 people say i'm complaining about losses. I'm not. It is garbage because I will click to play and just sit there for upwards of MINUTES (if it at all) before being matched and then it is against players with a wealth more experience than I (the new player). I am uncertain if this is the fault of poor MM programming or if it an indicator of just how few people play the game. High quality cards can be negated as an advantage with the mode that mixes both player's decks together (new players should ALWAYS pick their opponents commanders, they likely have a meta strat instead of just picking their 3 coolest looking characters). This makes it come down to purely player skill and luck of the draw, such as who gets all the CC and who gets nothing but infinity character cards. The players themselves seem friendly enough, but it is obvious that most of what you will find are veterans of the alpha build of the game, having either spent 100s of real money on cards, or simply having invested 1000s of hours during the game's hight of player usage (which, if that time is now, then what a sad state of affairs). So ultimately I would recommend this game if only to grow the player base and improve match making for new players. The various factions are unique from one another (but otherwise cliche) and mixing and matching your deck is fun. I think I'd prefer this game more if it was a physical card game i could pick up and play at a local card shop with people of equal skill and humble disposable incomes.			"

Early Access Review
								Its a good game.On the topic of Digital TCG and it being pay2win I gotta say no.Well, the difference between good cards and common cards can often be pretty drastic.However - the game uses a system in which one has to declare 3 of your own cards to be commanders - and the difference between a good Deck and a bad One is often decided by how well these three synergize.Which is a strong point of the game, because grinding just 3 cards together who do synergize is absolutely possible by just playing the different Solo-Campaigns - ofcourse this relies quite a bit on luck.However i've experienced the Reward and Achievementystem of Infinity Wars to be really fair - the game awards you quite often with a series of cards or single ones. In just some days I had quite a lot of the rare cards of the game - however the turning point for me was just getting that one commander who could win me games by being good as a standalone and synergizing with pretty much every faction.Unlike games like Pox Nora - i appreciate it that the starterdecks you unlock via the different campaigns are freely adjustable and every card goes in to your collection - so one can build quite diverse decks from the getgo.The thing is - when I start games like this i want to build my own decks right from the start and play even games - you know: win some lose some. However the bad matchmaking (sometimes I wonder if there even IS a matchmaking - 'cause even as a beginner you will get thrown in against veteran players with badges all over your screen quite often) could make on believe this game is pay2win. But even if your cards and strategies where of the same strength - good players will own you any day in this. The game is quite skilldependent and the time you need to learn the basics even and when to play your cards, learning which faction your opponent is playing and therefore how it can react will be accompanied by loss after loss.However the animated cards are quite a funny feature and the art is good - nothing i really dig like the MTG-Artworks but good all around.I dont like about the game that there's no way to get rid of soulbound cards you have to many of. (Most Cards are limited to three per deck - however the game won't stop to hand you out the 20th copy of the same wealthy noble ever)The game is quite lively and the community is rather nice.By that I mean roughly half of your opponents won't react to chat whatsoever - a quarter will 'gg' but I had quite nice short chats with rest of the lot. No Flame, no trolling - quite harmonic.Anyone who likes digital TCG and wants to give this a try I'd recommend playing it for ten hours or so - that's when you'll mostly likely have enough experience with the game, grinded enough to have a nice collection of cards + the occasional gamemaker-cards so the diversity will unfold before you.

												Currently I am at an odd stance with this game. I see its potential, but it seems held back by the way it treats new players. Is it pay 2 win? No. But while it isn't pay 2 win, it is very tough on new players. The matchmaking system shows no mercy upon new players, and you will be thrown against those who have much better deck comps than you. Is it possible to win with the beginner decks? Yes. But your chances of winning are much lower than those who have been playing the game for a long time. I've had fun with the game, and enjoyed the various different cards. But the multiple different classes and playstyles, makes it take forever to get an interesting comp together unless you want tospend money, or grind through the monotony of a beginner deck.  "

												After getting fed up with Hearthstone and MTG I was searching for a TCG that was free to play, lots of fun, strategic, and without a ridiculous barrier to entry with the sheer amount of cards you would need to buy to start making fun decks. This is that game. Honestly yes buying cards WILL give you or someone else a better deck. However, the game has a ridiculous amount of free cards available and they are actually so easy to earn that its not even like you are grinding them out. Every Level you get at least one pack. After I had earned only about 4-5 of the free packs I was able to put together a deck that beat someone who had two epic rarity cards in the command zone based simply on being better  at the game them him. That alone makes it worth it. Also, The cost to buy cards is amazingly fair. I'm loving the game and genuinely believe this game is better by far mechanically and costwise to hearthstone or MTG online.			"

												Big Magic the Gathering player here.One major turn off of Infinity Wars isn't that there are counters, but that there are HARD counters.I was running a Aggro deck of mostly 1 drop 4/2s, and would easily win most matchups. Then I would run into the Chinese based Defense Matters army and usually lose. No big deal, It's a bad matchup and you have to have those. Mind you I would still win 20% of the time, so there was always a chance.Then you run into the Chaotic ♥♥♥♥ers. Forget what the mechanic was called, but as long as you didn't kill the Monster/Creature/whatever it heals the damage you dealt to it and gets buffed whenever it kills something. Considering it's a 5/5 and my 12 guys running into it are 4/2s, it eats ALL of them. Coupled with the surprise factor, I could easily have my opponent down to 15 health only for them to flip one of those and suddenly be staring down a 45/45 Hexproof Indestructable with my entire board gone. Oh yeah. This damn thing that just ate my entire board? ""Cannot be killed by Non Damage Means"" and ""Cannot be targetted by spells your opponents control"". So my Kill spells can't get it out of the way, I can't bounce the damn thing out of the way,  my creatures stand no chance, and it's either don't attack or lose my force.All in all I was highly enjoying my time with this game, but when you go up against a deck that literally folds to you UNLESS they get one of their copies of a creature you literally can't touch, that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.It's a damn shame because the mechanics are tight, the (usual) way to play is highly skill based, and a right or wrong move can make or break a match. But then you just run headlong into hard counter and there's not a DAMN thing you can do.			"

												Game play is incredible fun and very addicting!  For that reason alone I highly recommend this game.This game has tremendous potential, and after having played it for some time (over 45 hours of game play at the time of this review), I suspect that a high amount of bugs and an often very unintutitive UI is what is holding this game back. In my case I found trying to view all my cards/deck building frustrating. And the first time my husband and I traded cards, the trade occurred without either one of us realizing that I didn't get my cards from the trade until I went to use them and couldn't find them. Imagine a UI where a person could make a trade like that with the wrong person. I would be unimpressed if this happened with anyone other than my husband who of course kindly re-traded the cards. In addition, I had to reboot the game constantly due to duel invites not being received from others on my friends list.But -- this game is free. What do you have to lose by trying it out? While the game is free, you have the option to purchase cards, but it certainly is not necessary to do so to enjoy the game. You are able to earn points to purchase cards with in-game currency if you desire to go that route. I would recommend anyone to give it a try, the game itself is amazing fun, but be prepared to deal with bugs and a UI that will sometimes leave you scratching your head.In the end, if the bugs are fixed and the UI made more intuitive, this game could sincerely blow other TCG's out of the water in my opinion, without question.  The game play itself is simply that much fun.			"

												I've been playing this for a few days. It's a fun game with some introductory campaigns that teach you to play and gives you some starter cards. You can earn more as you level up or you can buy packs, much like other trading card games. Intrestingly when you fight you and your opponents turns happen at the same time so you have to anticipate what they are goign to do rather than react to their last move. Its a free game so it's hard not to recommend it. It's lots of fun.			"

												Great game, very deep strategic decisions to be made, very complex deck building and it's more than just a TCG going digital, I don't see, how you would have fun with this on a tabletop as there are very many things to keep track of. Highly recommended!!!Update:I wish, I could give a ""partially recommended"". What I wrote above still stands, but I have to say, after a while, you find yourself either compelled to spend a lot of money to get the cards you need or to spend a lot of time to try and trade them, whereas you have dozens of surplus copies of useless cards rotting in your account. In short: the trade system sucks! You look for single cards and hope to find someone offering it for the stuff you have. Why not do an interim resource for which you can trade in your surplus cards to buy cards you need directly? Hearthstone (which I deem the way less interesting game) does it, Faeria (which is very nice, but not as good as IW) does it. What's the problem then? Hopefully someone looks into this, because the game itself is still my favourite digital TCG!!!			"

												I wasn't expecting much from this game. I downloaded it mostly out of boredom. This game plesently surpised me! I'm really having fun with it. The animations are well done and very cool to look at, the voice acting is good, and the gameplay is actually quite addicting. I love games of stratagy, and this game ticks every box for me. I love the ability to manage which troops to send into battle, and the ability to withdraw troops when they become damaged. I think the morale feature (when a character dies, you lose morale and when it goes to zero you loose) adds another layer of stratagy, as well adding value to each character you play. All and all, this is an awesome game and I can't recomend it enough. This is a FTP game that I honestly could see me sinking a little cash into, just to support the Dev. GOLD STAR!			"

												Typical TCG with breathtaking art animations (others not so much) and the concept that makes it so good - simotaneous turns.Do you move all your units onto the battlefield, or is the enemy going to play mass death, which kills everything on the battlefield? They moved all their units off the field, but they could be bluffing. This factor makes it so great.The UI is meh and campaign too, but the game itself is so fun that I would recommend it to anyone.			"

												When I first saw all the positive reviews, I was super excited to try out Infinity Wars, but after starting the campaign I thought it was the most boring thing ever. However, don't let the AI decieve you, playing against people is extremely fun. After grinding through all of the campaign and starting to play against human oppenents, I found myself glued to my computer for far, far, far, too long.			"

												thier is a bit of a pay to win aspect when it comes to getting cards with two seprate currencys systems. while so often thats the end to most games for me this game remains fun and playable at the free level. but if you play the campain which is very enjoyable you earn enough money and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of cards. with the 9 or so factions and the abillity to make decks out of up to 3 diffrent factions plus certin cards requiring that you deck have a higher purity ""double repersentation"" to be used in a deck thier is a large amount of varity in decks.

												Pros:1: A high amount of possibilities in deckbuilding2: An enjoyable campaign3: Gives you a MASSIVE collection to start with by going through the campaign. seriously, several hundred cards.4: Unique gameplay, not a ripoff of anything. Takes bits and pieces without being a clone.Cons: 1: Somewhat buggy interface at times2: Balance is a little off going through campaign, some colors are challenging while the rest are rediculously easy. Summary: As someone who has been playing MtG for years and played hearthstone since early beta, this game is definitely good enough to warrant a play for any CCG fan. It's one of the best F2P ccg's out there and it's shop is very reasonable. Highly recommended.			"

												Updated review after many months away.Same story as in the early access. Lots and lots of potential here. It just oozes it everywhere. However there are 3 big things that made me uninstall this for the last time.1. Most importantly is bugs. Bugs everywhere. I have lost so many matches that I actually won because the game froze and I was forced to quit out. Not to mention endless animation loops that force you to quit. also there are constant disconnects mid match. This is crippling in rift running where you only get 3 shots and your done. When you have a killer deck and end up losing it because bugs force restarts then it really kills your joy.2. Booster packs take foreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeever to earn once your boosted xp from low levels goes away. you get 170-350 currency for losing/winning. a booster costs 5250. as you can see you need a lot of wins or even more combinations of losses and wins to get 15 cards. There is trading but no auction house which this game desperately needs. 15+ wins for one booster might be tolerable assuming you win all matches except for problem 3.3. The community is very very very veeeeeeeeery small. I have sat in queues for unranked or ranked for 30-90 minutes with no matches. If you play at the peak hours its tolerable, but god forbid you want to play on non peak times. There just isn't a large enough player base for a pvp focused game. Even hex, duels of champions, and sol forge have larger player bases. Another consequence of the small player base is you are much more likely to get constantly steam rolled by the people that can dump hundreds and even for some thousands into this game.			"

												Infinity Wars is a TCG that reminds me of the Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game.  Infinity Wars has several factions that each have their own play style.  The tech faction is about upgrading your units to hell and beyond with cards such as (GIVE THAT MAN A JETPACK!) and the ability to combine units, so you can take an unit w ith tons of defense and one with tons of attack, and make one super unit that will nuke the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything.  The tech zombie faction takes dead units and revives them to return them to the game.  The Star Trek faction (not even ♥♥♥♥ing kidding) takes your enemy's units and makes them join your side.  The flaming dawn uses incredibly excessive attack to destroy the enemy base before they can get set up.It seems that every card in the game can be gotten for free if you take enough time, so that's nice.  The game systems are taught through a tutorial, so I'll only speak about my favorite of which.  You have three cards as a sort of sidedeck.  The three cards you choose in this sidedeck will be in a special zone at the start of the game.  These are called your commanders.  They determine the faction of your deck.  If you use one flaming dawn, one tech, and one zombie, for instance, you can use the weakest cards of all of them.  If you use two flaming dawn and one tech, you can use the tier 2 cards of flaming dawn and the tier ones of tech.  If you have all flaming dawn, you can use the tier 3s of flaming dawn.  This system allows you to choose between specializing or mixing.  It also makes it easier to get started, as you don't need a LOT of cards from one faction, just 20-30 from three of your choice to have a deck.  (You start out with a fairly crappy deck of your choice, btw, which you should only use in merged play or pauper mode, and use the free weekly decks for normal gameplay.)There are three game types that I have unlocked so far.  Infinite, which is just use the decks as normal.  Merged, which mixes the two players decks together, so you can use the same cards as your opponent and be on an equal field.  And finally, pauper, which forces both players to use common and uncommon cards.Give it a try, you'll only regret it a little.			"

												Most fun I've had in a CCG for ages.  Very friendly towards those that want a genuine Free To Play game - playing through the single player campaign will give you plenty of cards to start building decks to play with.  There's also decent free to play decks that work quite well and are fun to play while you're amassing your collection.  Online player base is young but growing, and the strategies that develop for shifting cards between different zones can get very entertaining and intense.  I've scraped out a win a couple of times with 1 out of 100 health left.  For newbies, just play through the single player stuff until it's done/boring and then build a deck and see where it takes you.  Good luck, and have fun!			"

												If you like hearthstone this game is a side grade in difficulty while keeping the same amount of f2p. The difficulty differences are hearthstone has more rng while this game has less rng but is balanced around predicting your opponent. If you ever got even slightly mad at losing because of the coin or because you went second in hearthstone you owe it to yourself to try this game its turn system is really good.			"

												As a Magic: The Gathering player, IW does a decent job at holding attention. Things end up feeling pretty same-y pretty fast, though, and with a bit of savvy it takes almost no time/effort to cruise through all the campaign and challenge missions.PvP is pretty limited in scope, and you get pretty used to seeing a lot of the same things. The game has some strong potential, though, and seems like a strong alternative to things like Hearthstone, Definitely worth a look.			"

												Slow at first, but then I invested money into the game and it made my experiance a lot more enjoyable. It started with a little spending, over and over again, eventually realizing that I had spent over $300 on cards. Now I have 5+ of almost every card. Only con. I have over 20 of the same rare cards and 0 of some legendary and epic, and you are only allowed 3 of the same card in a deck so I wish I could trade the spare cards for better cards, or sell the spare cards for Infinity Points or something. I heard tcg Hex has a market like this, I think I'll check it out.			"

												Really solid TCG.Pretty innovative mechanics in the Command, Attack, Defense and Support Zones and simultaneous turns. Sort of struck me as strange at first, since you don't answer your opponent's plays in typical TCG fashion, but instead have to outwit your opponent and predict what they're going to do on the current turn. Definitely adds a unique spin on things, and gets a bit easier to do (obviously) as you learn the cards and factions.Speaking of factions, there are eight, each with a free, basic unlockable starter deck. All factions are very different from each other, and up to three factions can be combined into a single deck, offering a ton of variety in builds.The free-to-play model is executed very well here, in my opinion, as you get a free card for logging in every day, and another (or sometimes a 15-card booster pack, though personally this has only happened once) for playing three full games that day. Any rarity card is obtainable this way, including Legendary, the highest rarity. There are also weekly quests, which award one card each, and a campaign for each faction, which unlocks the starter deck I mentioned earlier as well as some extra cards for that faction. Finally, every time you level up, you get a free booster pack. Buying packs with the in-game currency, Infinity Points, however, is definitely grindy, and it's pretty much one of the only cons I have with this game. Despite my never having bought a pack though, I have quite a few good cards, including a few Epics and a Legendary, and for the most part, can hold my own in a PVP match.Overall, I'm really liking this game, and it can only get better as more content is added.

												Changed to a Recommended because in the end I still enjoy playing the game.  The largest issues the game stem from its low player base and the nightmare that Lightmare Studios is.  Below is my negative review because, while the game is free, you should know what you're getting into and what its history looks like.~~~Changed to a ""not recommended"" because of the recent shop changes.  Long story short, you basically have to purchase lightmare points with real money to buy cards like you used to.  ~~~They've made changes from the original card packs to these new ""penta-packs.""  You can purchase faction packs, which made me really excited, until I realized you have to use lightmare points, 300 of them for 5 cards.  300lp =~ $3 dollars if you start with 0lp.  $3 dollars for a 5-virtual-card pack guaranteeing no more than ONE rare.If you want to buy cards using in-game currency, you only have two options, where you used to have 8ish, one pack from each new set of cards released.  Now, you can pick from the original card set, or the entire bunch of cards available.  The IW2013 Penta-pack and the Collection Penta-pack.  These each cost 3000 infinity points, where you used to be able to buy a pack of 3(?) for a little over 1000.  We can no longer buy packs of 15 for a little over 5000, they removed that feature entirely.  When they made these changes, it became practically impossible for me to card hunt like I used to.  I would buy card-set packs containing the cards I was looking for, 15 cards for 5000 like I said before.  These are the changes they made to the shop, and were the last straw for an otherwise avid player of the game.  I cannot and will not recommend the game because this has crossed the line and become pay-to-win.  Infinity Wars has a history of making the game harder and harder to enjoy for those who are not willing to purchase from the shop with real money, which should never be the case for any sort of game, free or not.

												Best game of it's kind, based in mechanics. The studio behind it is an entirely different deal, though. 8/10, has a plethora of rarely game-breaking bugs and flawed interactions, but the superior game mechanics offset most of the annoyance. A must if you like TCGs or want to get into the genre, just because of it's sheer potential. The community is very sweet unless you are a smartass or an obvious troll, even sometimes giving away free commons and uncommons to less experienced players.---EDIT: 31/12/2016This game sucks. Wish they sold the IPs and game mechanics to a competent team. So sad.			"
