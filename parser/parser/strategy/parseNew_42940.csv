												Last mission left and I am finnaly at the end of this DLC for Elven Legacy. It's easiest level are as hard as the base game's hardest level. Still have the same visual/music effect of the base game.Quite a challange compare to the first dlc and the base game but it's still finishable with a lot more save/load required Some map needs to be replay to replan to execute effectively. There are actually 2 story parallel to each other you to have to play though. IF you focus on one side of the story you will reach certain dead end that require to play the other storyline to unlock further missions.Overall this is not a walk in the park and certainly better designed and excuted then the base game and first DLC.7.5/10 and I recommend hardcore turn base strategy game fan to try this DLC as it's truly one to enjoy.

												DLC to a game I dislike. But on the other hand, it is a good deal when you buy it in package. And on Sale. Still not my cup of coffee.			"

												The campaign maps in siege are better than the ones in the main game and ranger expansion, but the diffuculty is not even comparable. You dont have any luxury of some units for valuable trades. Every map you are against powerful units and outnumbered in siege situations with rivers around castles and elite-defensive units guarding the quest markers. The maps are really nice, but the difficulty of this expansion is not enjoyable.			"
