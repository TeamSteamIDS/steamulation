												Given the charming, cutesy art and some emphasis on riding creatures, my initial thoughts were that So Many Me would be akin to Nintendo’s favorite kid-friendly pink puffball, Kirby, with some added puzzle elements to round out the package. And in some ways, I was right. The aforementioned art design is adorable and inviting, and riding the animals, (especially the dino), brought back fond memories of riding Rick the Hamster or Coo the Owl from Kirby’s Dreamland. But this is where the similarities to Nintendo’s friendliest series end, and for the better, in many respects. So Many Me’s emphasis on expansive, challenging puzzles and platforming prowess provides an exceptionally demanding cerebral and dexterous experience that I never expected. And I absolutely adored every moment of it.From the moment you boot up the game, you’re assaulted by one of the cutest and charming art styles this side of Kirby’s Epic Yarn, and from the get-go, the bubbly movement of the characters and the world they inhabit put a big smile on my face. But as adorable as they are, the graphics disguise the true nature of So Many Me. It’s extremely challenging. It’s easy to reach the end of each level, sure, but by only doing so, you’re missing out on more than half of what the game has to offer. Of the main worlds, (of which there are four, each with their own specific gimmicks) reaching the end, as I said, is easy to do. Rather than simple exercises in moving rightwards whilst jumping over small pits, levels range from small to expansive networks filled with traps and tricks for you decipher your way around. Most are avoidable, unless you aim to collect the three collectibles in each stage. Each level hides a costume, an extra Me, and an artifact. And these aren’t hidden in the traditional sense; you’ll be able to see them, plain as day, as well as the seemingly impossible-to-bypass trickery blocking your path to each. This is where the true game lies. The puzzles between you and those delectable collectibles range from the small and simple to the overly complex and level-wide. Even once you’ve figured out what you’re supposed to do, it’s an entirely different matter pulling it all off without screwing up. And you will mess up. A big part of what makes these often complex puzzle layouts complex , is that in congruence with an often demanding level of dexterity on your part, you will have to carefully manage the use of your me’s which provide you with stepping stones, switch presses, bounce pads and other varying abilities dependent on world. Mess up the proper order of tasks even once, and it’s back to step one. It’s as much about strategy as it is making each clean jump. I often found myself stuck on figuring out several of the more complex puzzles in the game for nearly a half hour or more, since there are often so many pieces you can experiment with, but it made the satisfaction of finally getting that artifact or costume so much sweeter. But most importantly, the collectibles matter. Besides the obvious use of having extra mes or new costumes (which you can use to uniquely dress up each and every me), artifacts are used to purchase perks, which range from the purely aesthetic to the all-but-necessary in reaching certain collectibles. There are no superfluous “good job!” collectibles here, and when the game really makes you earn each and every one, it truly feels like an achievement.Luckily, checkpoints are forgiving, and so long as you remain in the level, enemies do not respawn outside of specific instances, even after you fall into a spike pit a half dozen times. And thankfully, you’re never asked to find every collectible in a single go; you’re free to try again at any time, as each level is easily selected from the game’s pause menu. Allow me to iterate: Once you find a me in a given level, or a costume, or an artifact, it’s yours. Once you kill an enemy, outside of specific instances, that enemy remains gone, as long as you remain in the level. This all leads to levels feeling more like contained little worlds, rather than just levels, each with their own sense of progression, especially in some specific instances, where smaller puzzles act as cogs leading into a whole. Further variation in mechanics come in the form of your creatures, which you’ll utilize plenty, and the boss battles ending each world. These are generally of no real concern once you have their given patterns down, and it’s only until the final boss that you might have any real trouble, as the difficulty is dramatically increased here from what you’ve faced previously. But again, it’s all a matter of pattern memorization and careful movement.For anyone more inclined toward the purely platformer aspect of So Many Me, in addition to the four main worlds and end boss levels, the developers have kindly opted to include a fifth bonus world, filled almost entirely with exceptionally challenging platformance gauntlets. Many of these courses demand perfection on the part of the player to succeed, even more so than some of the later levels in the standard worlds, and each offers two elusive artifacts just out of reach for all but the most skilled platformer aficionados. With no checkpoints to speak of, a few skirt the line of frustration that lies between the game’s mechanics and your own inability to succeed, though it typically lies closer to the latter. I cannot stress how challenging some these completely optional segments are, and along with the larger puzzles provide some of the most satisfying moments in the game to best, especially with both artifact pieces in tow.So Many Me is brilliant. If it wasn’t clear in the preceding paragraphs, know now that I adored the entire experience. Despite looking more kid friendly in nature, So Many Me offers a fantastic challenge for puzzle and platformer fanatics alike, with some extremely intricate puzzles requiring serious forethought as well as dexterity and finesse. And to that end, allow me to make clear one final time: more than half the game lies in collecting the various trinkets. Failure to even attempt would be denying yourself the immense joy in besting the devious designs keeping them from you, and would keep you from experiencing the best of what this game has to offer, since reaching the end itself contains comparably little challenge on its own. Try and best each level, trinkets and all, and I guarantee that you will love the adventure as much as I. It took me 10 hours to complete everything, and that included plenty of screen-staring just trying to figure out many of the given puzzles. A keener mind than mine will finish it much more quickly. Me offers an adorable world, filled with beautiful scenery and character design, a silly and very self-aware sense of humor, plenty of seekables, and puzzles and platforming designed for a matured gamer wanting an actual challenge in their cutesy puzzle-platformer. That challenge is delivered in spades, and you’ll be grinning ear to ear, in between bouts of cursing at your own ineptitude. If you have a question about So Many Me or this review, leave a comment and I will answer to the best of my ability. "

												So Many Me is a breath of fresh air in a genre that is plagued with mediocre at best games. The gams is  first off is a very visually stunning game, I can't help but feel like I lost 50 points to my manliness scale when I play it because the artstyle makes me gigle like a schoolgirl. What I didn't expect on top of the great visuals is a great puzzle platformer as well. The mechanics are very solid and challenging, the idea of utilzing multiple replicas of yourself in unique ways to complete levels or get that epic hat that you've been wanting makes the actual gameplay experience very rewarding. The replayability is there as well, there are loads of unlocks that give you cosmetic items throughout the map. Obtaining these will allow you to customize ALL of your replicas. I HIGHLY recommend So Many Me for any fan of puzzle platformers or just simpily cutesy games.If you prefer video format of basically what I said up there I do that too!

												The character (or characters? because they are the same) is (/are) absolutely adorable. But the part that make this game best is well-designed challenging puzzles that you can play with relax atmosphere in game. Though the first look is just another of blah blah game but after you played through few levels, you'll fond with the game mechanics, which is, very special crafted and well-blended for the game. Background music is really great, in relax tone. Sound do help chilling your brain down from squeezing it to solve puzzle.This is a MUST for ones who want to enjoy solving puzzle with a good graphic, music and gameplay !!			"

												Wait, don't you even know So Many Me? Do you know Kirby, or at least Mario? If yes, then now start reading. So Many Me, yes, as it seems, it is 2D puzzled platformer game, like Mario but with some more features and puzzles, of course! From the first of gameplay, you including me will think this game is just sold for kids who just love soooo cuteee <3 arts. Yes, sure, it's cute and  graphics are super goooood... It is not burning your eyes like some 2.5 or 3D games. It will be good and relaxing in your eyes. What makes this game fun? Just when you played about half hour, you will forget game's cuteness like others said. Because puzzles are surprisingly harder than you expect, it requires quite some thinking to get past. I mean, to get all items, of course. Because going to the end of each map is too easy, and doesn't even require brains. Although storyline and boss battles are not really good, much. But overall, game is good to try. Try it, and you will know it worths.			"

												This is a great game, the art style, the cuteness, the story and even the puns.It deffinatly isn't for the faint hearted it requires alot of patiance and thinking outside the box. It will drive you nuts at times trying to solve the puzzles and the bosses. There isn't really much Killing its more so trying to work around the enemies and the enviroment but in saying that it doesnt mean there is no killing at all. You can customize your many me's with cute different outfits, and you also get the opportunity to be a Bird, a Jellysaur (yes thats right i said a Jellysaur!) and even a tank!If this was intended for children well i feel sorry for them, I can already picture many controllers being thrown across the room or even a desk flip. Worth every cent!			"

												So Many Me is a fun and simple puzzle platformer. It's easy to pickup and play with it's simple control scheme. The idea of the game is that you are saving a world where you run into yourself many, many times. You can use yourself in your adventures to turn into blocks and solve puzzles. It's a fun and interesting concept, but doesn't bring anything excitingly new to the table. If you have a soft spot for platformers, this one will fit well into your library.Here is my commentated video with more of my thoughts along with gameplay footage.

												Puzzle platformer where platforming ends up being part of the puzzles thanks to the abilities you gain. At the most basic, you get a queue of critters to run around with, with the ability to turn them into fresh platforms and other helpful things to hlep you get through the stages.Ridiculously cute, geniunely funny and surprisingly tough without getting unfair. Haven't gotten that far yet, but it does keep introducing new mechanics at decent pace, and then mixes and matches them with the ones already established in interesting ways.			"

												A really like the demo and bought the game a while ago, I left it there as I think it leverages too much on extremely precision platforming and puzzles that can end up being frustating because of the above reason. I like the challenge but nearly every single part of the game is precision platforming (when I say precision I really mean it, nearly at the ""pixel"" level or you just die and repeat). It is a shame as the graphic and characters are brilliant and I would have surely enjoyed it if it was a super mario style game more than a serie of frustating levels.			"

Posted: August 25, 2014
												Lets get the positive things about this game over and done with first. It's music is brilliant and the art has a cutesey charm to it that's...well, charming. Beyond that though? There is little to praise about the game.The games premise - at least from the trailer - would be that the game would at least try to put you in the mindset of questioning who you are in society, how different you are to everyone else who seems to similar, and perhaps this was me reading too far into the trailer (but starting it with ""Have you ever asked yourself the ultimate question in life?"" I assumed it was asking philosophy, not comedy), and while the 'clones' are present in the game, they pose little actual use beyond placable objects. You're given the ability to alter their properties when they're placed (to turn them into a balloon that floats, or a red splotch that you can bounce on), but the order you give the clones their property is the order you have to place them in - no switching what clone you're using, or seperating a modified clone with a default one - this adds a little to the 'puzzle' elements though I guess, but it just feels rather than using many 'you' (or many Me), you've only got one.Originally I played with keyboard and mouse (not the best idea), which uses the directional arrows rather than 'conventional' WASD, where the 'D' key has been mapped as a button to recall your last clone, and with no option to rebind the keys, I was kind of let down. I switched to a 360 controller and most of these troubles went away! Having the option to rebind the keys in game would be a bonus though, but I'm not sure how easy that is to do on Unity.I felt the controls were quite sloppy at first (both with k&m and controller), and the controls certainly aren't too refined, so it took some getting used to - perhaps this is because they look more like balls of goop than something solid, but occasionally things happened that I wasn't expecting with the character.The 'puzzles' are what you would expect from a platformer - find a way to get to a place to pull a switch that lets you do something else to get to the end - most of the puzzling involved is remembering what teleporter leads to what other teleporter, or pulling switches to see what it does. While it may sound as if I'm condemning it to 'give it to your child' I'm not. The puzzles combined with the enemies make this game somewhat challenging (most of this seems to be artificial challenge, given a lot of the puzzles can be skipped with skills you discover within the first level or so). Which now brings me onto one little element in the game. For 90% of the levels, you're able to move the camera around the level - as most puzzle games allow, so you can think things through, see what's up ahead, don't make silly mistakes (etc.), but for the last / boss level on every stage, this is removed, and for me this felt very restricting, and I can't really see why this was done, especially for one particular area - for the most part, jumping down holes at the bottom of the map results in death, for this one it resulted in moving onto the next area. It is a little thing, I know, but you set up a presidence (don't jump down holes unless you know you can survive it) and then you break it? Not brilliant game design, really.The enemies - for most part, are okay. Nothing special to talk about really - fair deal for platformer games; jump on their head (multiple times for some enemies) and they die, touch anywhere else and you die. There are certain enemies later on in the game that are able to kill you (virtually) instantly, if you're close enough and in a line of sight (even if they aren't 'looking' at you - which makes me wonder why they even appear to have a 'cone of sight'). While this means you have to deal with them in alternate ways than other enemies, given that you getting killed pulls you back to the last time you touched the ground, this can be annoying, as it reverts the clones to whatever they had been modified with beforehand, but recalls any clones you had already placed back, so for puzzles with longer setups, this can be annoying.And now this leads us into the bosses.When one of the features of the game is being panned by basically every review, you know something isn't right.While the bosses do share some story time (not all of them - the last one was a bird who got annoyed that it got woken up), most are rather irellevant and only seem to be there as other games have bosses. I would have recommended this game, despite the bosses, if it hadn't been for one particular boss - the lava boss. A lot of the time it seems you're making leaps of faith across gaps, hoping that you don't get hit by a rock, and doing that over and over - if you DO get hit, any work you have done to kill the boss is removed.Summing this game up in a sentence:It looks good, and sounds great, but beyond that it's not that much different to platformers already on the market.

												So Many Me is a game I'd recommend to those who enjoy puzzle games which take some time to complete but are not wanting to play a puzzle game where they end up going on Youtube for all the answers.The graphics are astounding and have a child-like feel to them but that doesn't mean that adults and teenagers alike can't enjoy them too. Using your many replications you go on a quest to save the world and the girl. Going through the game Filo and his many ""Me's"" often make jokes about 'saving the princess', 'getting the thing on the floor because you will need it later' and many other similar jokes. The concept of having many replications of yourself and completing puzzles with them definitely made the game more interesting to play.There are 3 unique forms of travel in So Many Me (apart from on foot) which are by Jellophant (Tank), Jellosaur (Dinosaur), Balloonbird (Bird). The forms of travel allow you to travel on spikes and destroy EVERYTHING, destroy vertical walls and jump higher and fly and destroy horizontal walls respectively. Obviously you have a Story which you can play and complete. Within this story are many costumes and coins which you can get through extra effort to eventually fully complete the game.Like many other reviews, the only important downside is the Bosses. The bosses themselves are not too hard but there are hardly any checkpoints in these battles so you have to memorise the landscape and the movements of the boss. Personally I had trouble with one section of the game. After the Final Boss (The guy you meet at the beginning) there is an escape part of the level. The path of this section isn't too difficult but the meteors sometimes hit you at the ONLY moments where you either dodge and fall off the map or jump off the platforms into spikes. The best part of all this is that there are NO checkpoints. If anybody wants to know, I got all achievements in 10 hours and 36 minutes which involves the main story, extra missions (Chrono Castle) and all collectables.I know it says 11 hours on my profile. That's because I left the game on while writing this review :D			"

												Don't let yourself be fooled by the childish art style, this game is haaaaaaard! Now, if you like a real platformer with a fair bit of challenge, you're in the right place! This combination of cuteness and hardcore platforming somehow reminds me of the first Rayman games back in the days.			"

												People seem to like itemised lists so here we go.WHAT I LOVED-Challenging puzzles. So Many Me really pushed and probed my brain in unexpected ways. The deceptively simple mechanics can be used in devious ways thanks to a clever rule: You use your petrified clones as stepping stones or switch-stoppers, but instead of allowing you to reclaim your clones in the more expected first-in/first out fashion, it has to be done in a last-in/first out one. This means that the most intuitive ""order"" of actions is incorrect and you have to learn to think in a different way. This also has the effect of constantly keeping you barely ahed of resource-starvation as you have to leave most of your available copies behind to allow you to retrace your steps when you find the key item or power-up that a certain obstacle requires.-Colourful and sharp graphics. The game is really easy on the eyes, especially if you like cutesy Nintendo-like characters and settings.-The soundtack is nice and evocative, if nothing super memorable. It helps you keep relaxed in the moments where you want to tear your hair off. How could a puzzle game provoke such reaction, you ask? Keep reading.-Achievements. Very few of the patronising ""you did something that you needed to do anyway!"" types and a lot of ones that encouraged you to go out of your way to do more things or do them in a different way.WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE, DIDN'T HATE/SOMETIMES LOVED, SOMETIMES HATED-Platforming. The overall mechanics of the game and the kind of obstacles and power-ups provide an opportunity for interesting and challenging platforming... however your character's movement is not as polished and pixel-perfect as it should be. This results in what seem like punishing and unfair deaths at some points which are especially frustrating when they come as part of a puzzle that requires a lenghty and complex setup on your end. The game includes a bonus challenge area where most of the puzzle elements are stripped out and it explores and pushes the possibilities of the platforming mechanics. It emphasises both the enormous potential of the world they built and the infuriating roughness of the controls.-Humour. It was pretty hit and miss. It made me smile about as many times as it made me roll my eyes.-Collectibles and game lenght. Too many of the former and a bit to little of the latter, which makes the former more obvious. There is a high number of seemingly random cosmetic collectibles plus a significant number of near useless upgrades and power-ups. Is all very harmless but it's hard not to think that they were created as filler content to fluff up a somewhat short and simple game.  WHAT I HATED-The story. I'll be blunt here: it was so bad that I wish it didn't have any story at all. Completely strewn with the most tired cliches and tropes which were made not any better by the characters continuously lampshading how very trite it all was. The fact that it was less-than-expertly translated to English doesn't help.-The last boss battle included one element of randomness that made an already long, difficult and repetitive sequence of actions all the more frustrating.All things said, the things I loved far outstrip the few glaring flaws, so I gladly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good brain exerciser.

												Don't trust So Many Me's cute exterior, because behind the mask of dozens of cute costumes and a silly story hides a feindish puzzle game. This games puzzles take time to unravel and all the while gives you cheery music and cute graphics to look at. I'd wholey recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle platformers.			"

Product received for free
												Disclaimer: I receive this game for free from the developer for writing a review in Thai here: https://www.blognone.com/node/58449So Many Me is a puzzle game where you have to control your characters from start point to finnish point. The very first stage are easy, but then the difficulty spike real fast. So you can expect a lot of WTF moments when trying to 100% complete the game.I still think this game is worth playing. It's not close to perfect, not even in my favorite puzzle games list. But looking back after years of lots of game playing, I find out that puzzle game is hard to made. And this game-- though I think it's not very good --still beats the average out of puzzle games in the market. So if you're into puzzle game, then gives it a try, you might be disappoint in some aspects, but overall you'll find it not hard to forgive and like it.			"
