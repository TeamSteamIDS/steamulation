												This is the best game in the entire catalogue of Sid Meier's Civilization, including the newer games Civ5 and Civ6.The attention to detail is far better in Civ4 than the newer games, and the AI is superior as well. The developers got a big head after the success of this game, and the newer games are just fancy revenue-generators. $$$Civ4 is the quality game in the series. My favorite parts of Civ4 are A: The amazing soundtrack B: The voice of Leonard Nimoy.Yes, Mr. Spock himself narrates your gameplay (singleplayer only).[Updated 3/21/17, still the best.]			"

												I have played ""Civilization III"", ""IV"", ""II"" and ""V"" (in that particular order). ""Civilization V"" is my favourite, but ""Civ IV"" has also a lot to offer and it's worth playing not only for nostalgic value. Everything what I'm saying relates to ""Beyond the Sword"" expansion and I highly recommend to purchase all the expansions, because, without them, the game is incomplete and you have limited mod and civilization options. (Actually, I don't understand, why people play vanilla versions. For ""Civilization"" games, it's usually like this: they release an incomplete game with some gameplay faults, which is substantially improved with following expansions – not only in terms of content, but also in terms of mechanics. I believe this will be the case with Beyond Earth, as well.)Here are some things that ""Civ4"" does have that ""Civ5"" doesn't, and things that ""Civ4"" is better at (well, imo, at least):+ More customisation options (e.g., no limitations regarding how many civilizations could there be per map size; an option to assign leaders to different civilization, for example, Ghandi as a leader of Russia).+ By far better interface (except, for one thing - when you are offered research/tech choice, you need to make decision right away - you can't examine your empire first. You can change it afterwards in the same turn, but, anyway, it's not very convenient). Apart from that, it's more easy to review the overall state of your progress. For example, howering over a tech gives you a detailed explanation of what you can achieve with a tech (units, wonders, bonuses for discovering first, etc.), why it's important and where it leads. Also, in ""Civ4"", there is the option to see the network of global politics or what a particular leader thinks of other leaders or what he wants or is willing to trade. I also prefer ""Civ4"" icons over ""Civ5"" icons.+ Unit appearance is different for each civilization and religion (and not just in terms of colour). For example, Korean swordmen will have different swords than European swordmen, a Buddhist missionary will have a different outfit from that of a Christian missionary.+ Cool wonder animations.+ Civics (ideologies) are available much earlier in the game, you can change them more easily and they are not linked to culture points. In ""Civ5"", many of the civic system functions are transfered to the relligion system.+ Map trading+ Cultural victory is actually a feasible option contrary to ""Civ5"", where it is possible only in rare occasions.+ Inbuilt World Builder (In ""Civ5"" it's available only from the ""Workshop"")+ Workers can build forest preserves (that add happiness)+ The rather unique ""Afterworld"" scenario and ""Final Frontier"" mod (which both feel like and actually are completely different games – full-conversion mods, if you like).+ Vassal states (you can push other leaders to become your vassals).+ No lag on large maps, since it is a much older game and requires less system resources.+/- Random events instead of city state quests+/- Workshops and windmills are tile improvements instead of buildings. +/- Religion doesn't have that much impact as in ""Civ5"". But it does have a considerable impact on diplomacy.+/- Culture bombs work in the same way as great general citadels.+/- Different great persons may discover different technologies.+/- Corporations - spread them like relligion and each corporation will have different effects. ""They are mechanisms that can add substantial production to a city, at the cost of higher maintenance costs. Thus, in essence they convert gold into other basic goods (food, hammers, science, and culture)."" [From Wikia]However, there are some aspects in which ""Civ4"" falls behind ""Civ5"":- Square tiles. Hexagon tiles are far better for strategical gameplay and layout.- Unit stacks. I know that I will be condemned for this and for a while I missed the stacking option in ""Civ 5"", but, when I got used to it, I must admit that one unit-per-tile limitation actually improves the gameplay a lot. With this limitation it matters much more where you put your units. You can manage your army more easily. The city placement has a bigger impact on your attack/defence strategy. And, finally, if you play smart, you can save more of your units (sometimes even win the game without loosing any unit), whereas in ""Civ4"" you are bound to throw your units into the battle as cannon fodder. ""Civilization 5"" feels like chess in that matter. And I prefer it that way.- Ranged units (Archers, Crossbowmen, etc.) don't have a ""ranged attack"" option. It is available only for siege weapons (""bombard"").- No city states. I actually like how city states provide bonuses, quests and influence the diplomacy. I think it's a better mechanic than influence points. Although, on the other hands, AI leaders in ""Civ5"" are completely irrational, their attitude sometimes doesn't make any sense and there is little you can do about it, whereas in ""Civ4"", you can at least change your civic/relligion or influence those of the AI leader.- ""Civilization 4"" is harder than ""Civilization 5"" (although it might be a good thing for some players). In ""Civilization 5"", I feel comfortable on ""Emperor"" and with a bit of luck I can manage ""Immortal"" on smaller maps, whereas I struggle on ""Noble"" in ""Civilization 4"". Perhaps, it's because I haven't played ""Civilization 4"" in years and hadn't developed any strategy when I did.- Technology trading. This actually makes the game rushed, unbalanced and it's much harder to make that technological gap between you and AI players. Although, there were moments, in ""Civ5"" multiplayer, when I wished there was this option. But, now, I see that research agreements are actually a much more balanced mechanic. Luckily, you can turn ""technology trading"" off in ""Civ4"".- ""Civilization 4"" pushes you to expand early (as mush as possible). ""Civilization 5"" pushes you to build army early (expansion is less crucial than in ""Civ4)"". I don't like any of the two, but, I think, that the fact, that AI civilizations are expanding so rapidly and that you need to keep up, makes ""Civilization 4"" unbalanced - it's hard to maintain positive stats and to manage the cities and units. In ""Civ5"", you can win with less units, less initial cities and the overall pace is slower, which allows you to build your empire in a more balanced way. ""Civilization III"" had the same problem btw.- No ""Steam Workshop"" support. But you can still use 3rd party mods.There are probably some more differences that I've forgotten, but, in the end, I would like to say that ""Civilization 4"" is a great game and offers many things its successor lacks. For that reason it's worth purchasing even today – not only for a nostalgic value, but also for the different and fun experience it offers.My overall rating: 9/10Also, my personal feeling is that ""Civilization 5"" is better in its strategical aspect, whereas ""Civilization 4"" is better in its ""God game"" aspect – just to fool around on easier difficulties.

												It's my honest and sincere belief that Civ4, when played with both its official expansions, is the perfect strategy game. I have a lot of trouble getting into most 4X games, even turn-based ones, but what I think makes this game far better, than, say, Galactic Civilizations 2, is that it's complex enough to give rise to various strategies, game styles and outcomes, but you're still presented with enough detail that you can look at your civilization, its cities and its individual units and find out exactly why they're unhappy, or unsuccessful, or unprofitable.Games like Galactic Civilizations 2 hide the formulas that govern your civilization under the hood, and playing them ends up feeling more like SimCity than Risk or chess: you simply find yourself responding to events as they happen, without a clear understanding of how your actions will affect even your own civilization. Civ4 throws that sort of design out completely--it's detailed, but not ridiculously so (like, say Master of Orion 3, where you feel like you're playing a spreadsheet), and knowing that its design is good, it doesn't feel obligated to hide the details.

												Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword must be the most complete Civilization to date. In some ways it is superior to its succesor Civilization V.Advantages of Civ IV BTS:+AI is much smarter+AI actually conquers other nations+Game includes vassal states (capitulate to save yourself)+Espionage mechanic makes much more sense (accumulate points to view demographics, cities, construction queue etc)+Larger empires+More complex mechanics (such as health and individual city happiness)+Technology trading (can be disabled)Disadvantages of Civ IV BTW:-Graphics are worse-Combat based on ""odds""  not health. So you can lose a unit with a 95% win chance.-You have to ""call"" someone before you can setup a trade. "

												10/10, The defining Sid Meier's: Civilization experience. Tons of civs to choose from, and a huge civilopedia providing a wealth of knowledge about them. The civs are all well balanced, and there are tons of maps types to choose from. You can easily create your own maps as well, though it can be time consuming. A lot of fun to play with friends, just be sure to turn random events off because they will make the game go out of sync. Has some flaws, like the random events in multiplayer, and the fact that the CPU is pretty much pre ordained to hate you and try to kill you no matter what. Maintaining friendships with CPUS is very difficult. The most annoying thing in the game is when you have a very high percentage to win a battle and you lose. That small percent is there, so this does happen occasionally, and it can be quite dsheartening. Not at all a game breaker though. I recommend playing with friends for a more challenging experience. Overall a great game with a lot of replay value.			"

												I'll start by saying that this is not a game for casuals, if you want to have a game that is incredibly compelling and complex and rewarding to learn, this is your game.  While Civ 3 remains a complete mystery to me, I can say I have played all the others, and this one is by far the best I've played.  You might say ""what about Civ 5?"", but I highly prefer it to Civ 5 for several reasons (unit stacking ***Figure out how to use collateral damage people***, tech/espionage/culture slider, much more micromanagable empire, better system for unit and city maintenance, far superior espionage system, more interesting promotion dynamics with military units, unrestricted leaders, non gimmicky leader traits, non gimmicky religions, far superior map option, way less annoying barbarians, way less buggy multiplayer, etc etc etc...)I have dumped hundreds of hours into this game on steam (untold hundreds more on my non steam copy) multiplayer on the steam servers just last year and still have no fatigue of this game.  The replay value is incredible and you can even find interesting strategies with unrestricted leaders.  If you like Civ 5, and have never played Civ 4 BtS, and want to take your Civ experience to the next level, I highly recommend you this game for you.  It can be overwhelming at first, I know, but give it time, it's a seriously good game.			"

												Pros: +Fun and deep gameplay, lots of viable strategies and playstyles makes the game very accessible. +The game is pretty easy to mod, and theres a huge, still living mod community.+Mods are WAY better than Civ V mods, most mods are huge overhauls that add sci-fi elements, fantasy elements, make the game more ""realistic"", it's just great.+Good variety of Civs, each with two traits, two uniques and two starting techs.Cons-""Native America"" is a Civ, which is really dumb, the leader is Sitting Bull, a chieftain of the Hunkpapa Lakota, his unique unit is a Dog Soldier..a soldier class of the Cheyenne and his building is a Totem pole....which is a religious symbol for Alaskan (I forget which) tribes.-The ""health"" system seems like an unneeded secondary lock on how big cities can grow.-The ""happiness"" system is generally good, but can lead to some annoying moments.-Traits aren't all that balanced, ""financial"" is just so good while ""protective"" is just so bad.Full ReviewQuite possibly one of the best games I've ever played. Games are long and difficult, leaders are very animated and expressive and the soundtrack is utterly fantastic (Netherlands and Greeces theme are such smoothing tracks). The leader variety is slightly greater than Civ V (but Civ V has more civs with more unique abilities), and each leader has two traits, like Abraham Lincoln is Philosophical and Charismatic while Montezuma is Aggressive and Spiritual, for the most part these traits are fairly balanced, but there are a few expeditions of just play bad traits (Protective is infamously underpowered).Each Civ also has their two ""uniques"", unique units and unique buildings, unfortunately I don't really see these often being huge game changers with a few expeditions like Englands Redcoats, Ethipoias Omoro Warriors or Sumerians Ziggurats, this is probably cause the games combat is by far the worse aspect of it, units stack meaning most depth and strategy can be replaced with simply rushing enemies with strong melee units and hope to win, hope you built a lot of archers!

												Most amazing game of all time. I easily have several thousands of hours maybe even tens of thousands in all civ titles together playing it since civ 1.But civ 4 is the best in terms of depth, replayability and strategies. Its not as dumbed down as civ 5 and has many ways to win the game not just war.Edit:To add a little depth to this review, compare the mod features of civ 5 and 4 and you will easily see how superior Civ 4 still is even without Steam Workshop Support. - Civ 4 has Multiplayer Mods. Still not happy? - Civ 4 vanilla has a working AI, want more?- Civ 4 Ai can be modded to kick you in the butt unless you are a freakin PRO! More?- Civ 4 has many ways too win and each can be played for equally...- Civ 4 offers small civs a debth and playability you cannot get in civ 5 it is actually pretty damn well balanced. Since with small civs you can outtech bigger guys like crazy... he attacks with stacks of doom 4x your size? Who cares his Swordsmen are no match for your riflemen...done that dozens of times...- Civ 4 has a well balanced techtree with rounded civics that work like a charm beside it. You can stack your bonusses to match your preferred way of winning. Tech-crazy, Culture♥♥♥♥♥, Militarist, Space-Alien-Weirdo...and so on. Ever wanted to get diplomacy to be transparent in 5? Me too...never really worked. In Civ 4 it is transparent, you can actually rely on the information in diplomacy. Are those pesky civs getting on your nerves...mod it, mute them, play in peace and calm :) Alright so the only downside for some might be the stack of doom, but if you rely on that vs a skilled player you can probably kiss your stack goodbye anyway... so, in MP a non issue if you know what you are doing. In SP, well... it actually is not a clickfest like civ 5...""hey your 500000 units need to move...even though the entire map is already filled with units, but please do...""Hands down...Civ 4 >>>> Civ 5 all the way except in graphics :)			"

												In Sum: My all-time favorite PC Game, and probably the best version of Civilization.  5/5.-----Ah, Civilization IV:BTS, the game that stole so much of my life.  Civ IV is a classic. After some of the frustrations with Civilization III following the majesty of Civ II, IV felt like a return to form for the series.  It has a lot in common with III, of course, but it made the game feel epic again.  It also resolved some of the awkward controls the series was known for, and added a few intriguing features.  In particular, religion, corporations, and civics (borrowed from Alpha Centauri).  What BTS gets right is amazing. There is a lot of depth to the decisions being made, and it can be a complex game if you want it to be.  The civic system lets you fine tune your own custom government (a theocratic police state with a free market?  Go right ahead!), with the rewards and penalties mixed, like in the classic Civs.  The diplomacy is vital to the game, and the AI's opinions of you actually matter, and can be influenced.  Where it gets it wrong tends to be the tedium and the stacking mechanic.  Civ III and IV suffer from a design oversight that became a mechanic, called 'stacks of doom"" in which not only could an army be overpowered by playing upwards of 30-40 units in one tile, but such play became essential to win.  The city attacking and defending mechanics also leave something to be desired, as they are intended for stacks of doom.  The gameplay can be tedious compared to Civ V, many turns can pass without anything happening.  But it's also more satisfying when you get to victory in this game.  And there are more victory options in Civ IV: BTS than any other Civ game, including early game victories such as religious.  This game was so good in its time that even today the Civ fans are divided between Civ IV and V, with many fans preferring this game over the new version.  I do consider it a matter of preference, as I play both.  Last of all, certainly not least, Leonard Nimoy narrates this game in a Leonard Nimoy fashion.  It fits the game perfectly.			"

												This is the best Civ game imho, better than Civ 5.Civ 5 has better graphics, thats the only thing better in that game, in every other aspects Civ 4 wins.Of course using mods is a MUST for Civ 4, especially modpacks like Realism Invictus 3.2.That will turn the game a much better experience, like a total overhaul, and its free!

												One of the best turn-based strategy games on the market currently. The ""one more turn"" mentality just keeps pulling you back for exaclty that: one more turn. It is the best turn based strategy game that Sid Meir has put on the market. If you want to kill a few hours, set aside a week because once you start playing, you won't want to stop.			"

												This is the best civ game hands down.  I have played Civ II through VI and you simply will not find a better Civ game, couple this with the Rise of man mod and you might just have the BEST turn based game out there...I haven't played all of em yet.  Do not, I repeat...Do NOT listen to people who say CIV 5 or 6 is better, they are either young or ignorant in some way, this game is like crystal meth mixed with crack for your gaming soul.  Forget work, your friends and your family, even your dying relatives, you will not want to do anything but log your first 1000 hours of this game.  After that you might have time to return to some kind of a normal life but you will still play the game a lot.  I don't even need to tell you specifics about how the game works it is literally that good.  You will give up your faith and praise this game on sundays just so you have that extra couple of hours to get in some more turns it is that good.  Buy it, steal it, kill for it, just get it some way.			"

Pros:✔Classic Civilization experience✔Sound design. Sounds is great, music is even better. Baba Yetu for example✔Visual design. This is the best mix of realistic and cartoonish style✔Gamespy is finally gone. You can play with steamworks now✔Large mod community,that is still aliveCons:✘Units can stack. This is the weak spot of Civ IV. You can stack like thousands of units in one tile. War becomes pure madness✘Sometimes AI is too stupid. Building forts on oil. Yeah right, this is gonna work. What?Fish for uran?Sure!Well, the age of this game has passed. Civ V now taking its place. But still, if you fan of Civ series, you should definitely check this out.			"

												Still my favorite Civ game. Admittedly, I have never actually played Civ 5 or 6, but I have read about and watched them, and am quite happy with this one (although tastes do differ).Unquestionably a direct upgrade from Civ 3. Corruption is gone! Research and production have overflow now! You can tell how much techs cost!  Culture makes sense! Diplomacy makes sense! There are now anti-StackOfDoom units!If you're new to the Civ series - well, this is the cheapest entry except 3, and there's enough options and difficulty levels that pretty much anybody can find something that works for them. You can pretty much ignore many of the aspects of the game if you want to.Did I mention that this game has Leonard Nimoy? This game has Leonard Nimoy.Of all the games in my Steam Library, this one has given me the most hours of fun compared to the cost (except TF2 - can't really beat infinity).My advice: get the Complete Edition during a sale. A real steal at six bucks.			"

												This is a very good expansion for Civilization IV.  It still plays better overall than Civilization V, but the combat system can be frustrating when a warrior beats your gunship.  The graphics are quite low-quality compared to Civ 5's graphics, altough expected for it's age.  If you are new to this series I would reccomend Civ 5, but if you have been playing for a while and don't have this one, you should get it.			"

												If for whatever reason I could only play one game for the rest of my life, I would have to pick Civ 4.  It just has so many ways to play your civ, so many ways events can unfold, and so many classic mods.  IMO one of the best games ever made of any type, and certainly the best hour-eating, ""where the heck did the time go"" monster I've ever loaded up.  The shining star of the Civ series, and a must play for anyone who likes turn-based games.  /endgush			"

A week into the game and everyone is taking sides, borders have been established, political turmoil is evident, armies are building up, and alliances are being tested. Then that declared war horn plays, literally everything spirals out of control in the coming days into that horrible rift of conflict as one country after another gets sucked into it.			"

												All things considered Civ IV is, quite simply, the best Civ game there is (with the expansions; Beyond the sword being an absolute must have).I have had the disk version of this game for years, and have played it so many times, and never gets old.Vastly superior to Civ V which is lacklustre by comparison and, sadly, vastly superior to Civ Beyond Earth (+ BE Rising Tedium) which should have a been a brilliant game but just lacks so much.Even with the dated graphics and original square based system (rather than the standard hex these days), it is just utterly suberb for many reasons, the main 2 of which is:1) comes with a really easy hands-on map/civ editor so that it couldn't be simpler to create the kind of maps you want to play on; allocate global rescources to create trullty strategic scenarios, allocate where civs are, territories, allocate science, city infrastructure etc etc, the possibilities are endless. 2) the Modding support for the game is HUGE. There are so many wierd, wonderful and awesome things you can add to the game, whiether you want to be historically accurate and/or add fantasy+sci-fi elements to it, there is so much choice for the player. This is CIV games at its finest. The choice of leaders is huge, each with their own bonuses, and characteristics. Diplomacy is FUN and engaging! The only thing I would add to it is a more interactive combat system.Highly recommended and IMO unsurpassed at this present time.			"

												I am 34 years old, married, and work as an academic at the university. Not the average gamer, you could say.My gaming experience started with Dune 2, followed by the Settlers, C&C and Red Alert. I found nothing as interesting and addictive since then. You may know what I mean.And then I got sucked into Civ5 2 years ago. I've never played a TBS, only RTS. But I really loved it. Now I learned that CIV6 is scheduled for later this year, but at the same time I learned that some hard-core CIV fans prefer CIV4 over the later versions.I wanted to know why. And now I so do! If you are like me, you will love CIV4!What do I mean? I mean if you prioritise the plot of the game, the depth of the scenario over the graphics, this game is so for you (not that the graphics is bad!)If you actually want to think whilst playing, if you like complexity, if you enjoy devising long-term strategies and short-term tactics, you will love CIV4.

												A godly strategy game, even among other godly ones. I cannot tell you how many hours and games I have played this game, on top of the time playing the amazing Fall From Heaven 2 mod for it. A prefectly balanced strategy game where the pros will make flawless palyes while even the noobs can make smart desicions based off minor details. The great thing about civ 4 is that it can be as complex as you want it to be. Starting out, all you may care about is how many units you can build. As time goes on and mroe games are played, you get a stronger sense of how the game works, up to the point where your inspecting every detail of the unhappines of each city you control, and resolving it to get maximum science efficency for a specific tech, to trade it for another tech to make your armies stronger against a certain individuals city defence. Its complexe formulas like that the seperate the pros from the noobs, but even noobs can still have a fun and engaging experience in what is probably the best strategy game released in its decade. "

												      The price is right, and the gameplay and UI are FAR AND AWAY better than Civ V. The graphics are dated, but if you want eye candy, go play DOW 2. This expansion of Civ IV has been out since the summer of 07. In those 5 years many free mods have been made for the game, ranging from specific historical battles, to purely fictional settings. A great fantasy mod is Fall from Heaven 2.       Another mod, Legends of Revolution adds depth and polish to the original game and is more stable and less laggy. Regular Beyond the Sword even after they patched it as best they could would crash after 3 or 4 hours of play, and crash when the game got in the later ages. LoR as its known has crashed once in 500+ hours of play. I play games all the way to the end everytime, something that I could not do in vanilla Beyond the Sword. Im revising this review in 2016 (was originally written in 2012) and I still love playing this game, 9 years on. I own V but never play it.			"

												I love this game so much, so here is a game I once played on Prince difficulty.4000 B.C.We, the Carthaginian peoples, have fought for many decades now. However, I, Hannibal, has risen to command a group of settlers, they wish to not fight, but live.  We set out tomorrow for new lands, ones untouched by the others.We wish to settle,we wish to build a Civilization.3000 B.C. We have settled many cities, 3, in fact.One has built up its infrastructure, one has built an army, and the other gathers foods for our cities.We have met a new people, they call themselves ""Greeks"". We otherwise do not know much about them.We also have created a system of writing and mathematics.Our people have entered in a new era of learning.1500 B.C.We have now created a naval empire, spanning the globe.Trading has opened up with many other peoples.Our allies have created the seafaring league, made up of the Sumerians, the Greeks, and the new people, The Franks.The culture of our people is growing every day.500 B.C.We are facing crisis now.The city of Carthage is under siege by the rebellion.We are weak, so the Sumerians have invaded.The Greeks and Franks are now meeting eachother on the battlefield.200 B.C.The Carthaginian army now stands at the city of Ur, ready to fight.What once was an empire forged by trading and peace, now stands as a military nation controlling the oceans.0 A.D.We won, and we have an empire.Our cities grow in power and size, and we have created large wonders for all to be in awe for.500 A.D. We yet again face crisis.The Franks, now in a nation called ""France"", have invaded and took many frontier cities.We have lost overall about 28% of our power.Yet we still hold the holy land of Hinduism, and that is their religon.However we have long since abondoned the days of multiple gods, we believe in one god.1500 A.D.Legends tell of another land, we have set out on a journey to find it.1791 A.D. We have won, Democratic voting last year elected me as world leader.I, Hannibal the 124th, will be elected tomorrow.I have completed the vision of my fathers and their fathers before them.I have built a civilization to stand the test of time.10/10 favorite game ever.(Maybe until civ 6)			"

												Civilization IV aged extremely well and remains a really good game.It's different enough from Civilization V that frankly it doesn't matter which game is ""better"" or ""worse"" - it's perfectly possible to enjoy and play both.One strong point of Civilization IV is the amount of awesome mods developed by the community, giving it a lot of optional extra depth and complexity.

												I do not know how civilizations 6 is, but the limitless customization inherant with the mods to this game make it by far the best to date, as even if you bore of vanilla play, it has preloaded mods that themselves are entirely games to their own, and on the Civ Fanatics site you can find links to get an overwhelming level of mods that you don't have a life time long enough to actually try them all.Mods to get with this: Plantetfall, Fall From Heaven 2 Ashes of Erebus, Caveman2Cosmos.

												This game makes me actually feel important, and when war comes you will feel like a general in an old war. You'll lose units, make harsh choices over who to train, whether to burn or take over a town, and a lot more. That's just war while there's still the religion, tech, expansion etc. but you'll most likely be put in a war, and that's where Civ 4 is at it's finest in my opinion. If you want to feel like an old leader and pick up the stress, buy this game, but if you don't like that kind of thing then good luck enjoying this.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time.  Civilization IV (with both expansions: Warlords and Beyond the Sword) fully captures what it means to be a ruler in a realistic world.  Your civilization begins in the Ancient Era and (if you don't win sooner) extends all the way into the Future Era.  You get a front row seat as your civilization evolves before your eyes while you lead your people through war and peace.  An incredible, deep game for any fan of strategy-based gaming.			"

												Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword makes an already phenomenal game even better. The new espionage elements and the Apostolic Palace work together to make the game's diplomatic system more interesting and a lot more flexible in terms of projecting your will on your enemies without resorting to open warfare. An improved AI wages war much more effectively this time around which can drastically increase the drama and tension of your games.Still, it's not without problems. The espionage system is far too effective on Marathon speed, and the way that corporations work doesn't seem to make much sense. The overall presentation or interface of the game hasn't been improved by the expansion either. Additionally, there are undoubtedly small balances and tweaks that are sure to be coming down the pipe over the next few weeks. In the meantime, the new options and increased difficulty of Beyond the Sword are more than enough to justify its purchase by every hardcore Civ fan. As for the scenarios and mods, some are definitely more interesting and polished than others but your mileage here will vary according to your interest.			"

												I got this game alongside the other DLCs and Colonization, and i can truly say i have one-more-turn-itis. It is beyond addictive, and i often find that time just slips past while playing this game. Along with the easy-to-mod capacity, and some of the best listed in the scenarios section, this makes the game an awesome play-through, again, and again, and again. With different nations, and world settings, as well as ways to win, eveyr single play through is different. PLus, with LAN and Wifi conected MP, you can play large Multi-player games against a much more challenging matchup then the AI(whcih, as good as it is, is nothing like a human), and you can play your friends with the Hot-Seat MP, on just one PC.This is an epic game, and worth a purchase. 11/10			"

												Play Length: Extensive multiplayer matches.  A little bit of single player.Positives: The most important thing for a strategy game is of course the strategy.  This game has a very impressive amount of depth.  I like that who you choose as your world leader matters, and that each one tends to feed into a different playstyle.  I like that there are various ways to win, including many non-violent ways.  You can not only win through military force, but also through technology or culture.  This is just a very cool concept for a strategy game.  But it's not just that the concepts are neat; they are also well executed.  It feels like the game is pretty well balanced, and that there are many legitimate ways to play.  Now, I'm not very familiar with the meta game, so for all I know in the competitive scene mulitary may be the way to go.  But for casual playing, it feels like there's a wide variety of ways to play, and that's mainly what interests me.Also, Leonard Nimoy lends his voice to this game.  That's a huge positive for me!Negatives: While the graphics are perfectly serviceable, sometimes I feel they come acrossed a bit dopey; especially the cartoonish portraits of the world leaders.  This game is turn based, and while I enjoy that style of slow and methodical gameplay, some people may not appreciate that as much.  This weakness can be magnified if you play with the wrong people... it can be annoying when one person is taking a really long time to act every single time.  The in-game music is very timid and fades into the background, it didn't do much for me.  Sometimes it creates a nice ambience, but a more memorable soundtrack would have increased my enjoyment of the game.Overall: It's one of the best strategy games around, as far as I'm aware.  Certainly one of the best I've played.  If that's what you're looking for, then you've come to the right place.About my rating system: I have two things I rate on.  Overall score, and soundtrack.  Personally, I feel like game soundtracks are tremendously undervalued; to me, it's a vital factor in getting me into the game.  For the score, I grade on a scale of 1-10, and I try to grade in such a way that each number has a meaning and equal importance.  The meaning of each number are as follows:0: Garbage, 1: Awful, 2: Poor, 3: Underwhelming, 4: Mediocre, 5: Decent, 6: Good, 7: Great, 8: Excellent, 9: Phenomenal, 10: MasterpieceCivilization IV's score:Game Rating: 7 (Great)Soundtrack Rating: 4 (Mediocre)			"

Releasing 47 paid DLC after the main game is also not appealing - in fact it's rather thieving.  Civilization 4 and Civilization Beyond the Sword have pages of mods which are DLC with no fee, with more variety or challenge or relief or humor than everything released by corporate names.			"

												tl;dr: If you're new to the Civ series, get Civ5 instead. If you started with Civ5 or Civ6, try this-- you may or may not enjoy it, it's a totally different experience than those games.For exposition, I started the series with Civ5, and have played Civ6 and CivBE and love them all. But this is a totally different experience than all of those.I can't really decide whether or not I like this game. There are so many aspects that I adore that they didn't return in Civ5, but there are so many things Civ5 improved on that I feel this game is missing.First I'll start with things I love:+ The culture system. I think Civ5 did culture a lot better, but it's very different. The culture system is the one biggest thing that makes me keep wanting to try this game out-- I love the idea of being able to peacefully flip tiles and cities. I wish Civ5 had this; I think it would be great especially with the tourism addition.+ I love being able to zoom out the whole map and see a globe.+ A very great selection of leaders; multiple leaders per one civ.+ The victory conditions for domination and space race are honestly much, much better than in Civ5. They're more dynamic; in Civ5 you just gotta own all the capitals to win, which is kinda lame.+ You can (and actually are encouraged to) play wide.And the bad:- Everything is connected to your gold treasury. Your science, culture, etc. outputs are all determined by how much money you put into them. It's weird though because I don't understand if there are really any penalties for having 0 gold...? You can't go negative and your output per turn won't go lower if you have no gold left.- Square tiles, I know everyone complains about this but, for real. They're really unbearable coming back from Civ5.- There's not as much of a sense of scale in this game compared to Civ5. Games feel a lot quicker, more like you're just rushing through eras.- And of course, the tiles of death. What can I say that hasnt been said?Conclusion: It's cheap, so try it if you're used to Civ5. Honestly, everyone gets something different out of these games so it can't hurt to try. You may love it, you may never pick it up again.I'm honestly going to need to keep trying it. There's so much I love, so I'm gonna give it some more chances.			"

												It's a fine game, but gets boring really quickly if un-modded. I don't know about Civ5, but the 4th is surprisingly bland gameplay wise (bts is just a gimmicky add-on). The combat is mindboggling weak, not even to par with ancient Call to Power 2, which I find generally better from Civ4.Yeah, you have upgraded graphics, leaders that mostly are fine, but the lack of content is - again - surprising, especially in civics and combat aspects. Espionage is a chore, the growth mechanic is irritiating, religions/corporations don't really matter much, technology is boring.Of course it's fun to play up to the certain point, it's not a bad game, but personally I would rather launch Call to Power 2 once more, which decades ago handled combat better and Civ up to this point can't simply implement obvious improvements offered years ago by CtP2.Maybe I will try some mods or Colonization, but I'm fed up for the moment.

												Once upon a time, this was the best Civilization game available - for a time, even after the release of the newer Civilization V, people would call this title the best.I'm unsure if I agree anymore, but out of personal experience, the title is tied between this game - with gamey, but believeable AI, and tons of mods that change the game in many interesting ways, and Civ V after all expansions and patches, more accessable and 'different'.  Still, Beyond the Sword is the definitive Civilization IV experience, with new technologies filling out the tree, more civilizations, and even new leaders for many - and mods are available such as the ever-popular Fall from Heaven 2, of which a supplied BtS scenario is a prequel to!All said, I've played this since it was on a play/install disc set, and it still stands up.

												This was a game I played hundreds of hours on long before I discovered Steam. As soon as it was available, it was a must-have purchase for me.Civ IV is a sublime strategy in the truest sense of the word. Spanning over 6000 years of human history, you'll start with a single settler forming a tribal village. Dozens of hours later you could be sending a fleet of warships to control oil deposits in the north pole, taking control of the global market with a corporation monopoly, or ordering a charge of knights in a futile last strike against an Aztec airbase.It's a game that provides multiple ways to win and even several options to get to each of those conditions. You will compete against up to 18 other nations using diplomacy, warfare, exploration and luck to establish an empire. You will need to stake a claim on finite global resources, defend your borders, make friends and defeat enemies. Spread religion and corporations to control the masses and bankrupt your ememies. Deploy spies to see enemy troop movements or sabotage their reserach and production. Build great wonders to boost your cultural impact. Difficulty is easily scaleable and 'tweakable', providing a fantastic challenge. Perhaps you will triumph...and perhaps you will meet your end at the hands of Mahatma Ghandi's nuclear arsenal. One thing is for sure...you will have many, many replays of this game.THEN there are the scenarios - various historical or fictional settings that tweak the rules and gives special conditions. See if you can spot the mod (inclided with the game) that inspired their later offering - 'X:COM Enemy Unknown'.In Short: The greatest strategy game ever made*- there'll be no need for friends, jobs or even sunlight anymore with this baby. The only reason you should not be buying it is because you were reading this review. But it's over now...so go guy it!*This includes the more recent title 'Civ V' -- a competent game, but inferior in my humble opinion.			"

Civilization IV: Beyond The SwordThe following review will focus first on Civilization IV as a whole, then on the expansion ""Beyond the Sword"".Civilization IVCivilization IV was the first game of the Civ-series to go 3d, for better or for worse. The graphics are in fact atrocious compared to the newer Civ 5, and even Civ 3, with its 2d isometric graphics and heavy reliance on shades of brown. But as any fan of the TBS-genre will tell you; graphics are secondary to everything else.You may ask yourself ""why invest in Civ 4 when Civ 5 and BE is out?"". Well, apart from having better graphics and adding (and taking away) certain features, there aren't many differences between these games. Some of the most important differences (or improvements as some will call them) are the limitation on movement and stacking in Civ 5. One may argue that limitations compared to older versions are negative, but the point would be moot when faced with ""the stack of doom"". So yes, at first glance, the newer games are better. There are however saving graces for Civ 4: Plenty of advanced and interesting mods, as well as a (more) stable multiplayer, the latter of which is laughable in Civ 5.Beyond The SwordBtS is arguably the largest expansion to any of the Civ games, and a must-have if you want to use mods, as most of them now require it to work. It adds quite a few new features, including, but not limited to:Ten (10) new civs, as well as 6 new leaders for existing civs.Corporations: The religion of business.Random events: FUNLots of new game rules and options, to help customize your experience.In conclusion: If you like the civilization-games, but don't care about graphics, or don't like the limitations of Civ V, or like Civ but want it to be more advanced with certain mods, or just want to be able to play multiplayer for more than 10 minutes without having problems; i would suggest grabbing Civ IV with BTS as soon as possible.

If Civilization 5 was a game that needed to be saved by DLC, this is a game that is taken to new heights by its DLC.Beyond the Sword comes with many interesting new mechanics that do a lot to vary gameplay and encourage a more tactical mindset. What resources are important to me? How will my city's starting position affect me in the late game? Is it worth it to create an overseas colony?The renewed Espionage system is a blast, though for my money it's too easy to discover enemy spies.Advanced starts and the new scenarios are also a lot of fun. Civ 4 complete is $30, but you'll get a LOT more value out of this purchase than most $60 ones.9/10, absolutely excellent.			"

												287 hours of fun (plus more!). Yes I have played the newer civ games, but this one for me, is by far the best. I love everything about it, the graphics have a unique style, the gameplay is fast and fun because of the very quick loading times between turns (which 5 and 6 lack for me). Everything is just perfect, if I could actually make a good youtube video, it would be very high up on my favorite games list. It is a game that is VERY close to my heart. Buy it now! You won't regret it!			"

Mods or not, the game guarantees endless hours of fully customizable gameplay, including custom map support, toggleable options, modable game assets, and an in-game 'cheat mode' that can be disabled or used to gain full control over the game... No matter how you play, the game is amazing and runs well on older computers, given its age. This, however, does not stop the game from supplying you with stunning visuals and some of the best music.			"

												Best of the Civilization games; I've probably wasted a thousand hours of my life on it outside of the Steam version.  A lot of government, micromanagement, military, diplomacy, and victory options make it much more complex than the earlier Civilization games, but it offers a lot of tutorial and advice for early difficulty levels so it's not hard to get into.  Decent enough graphics even in 2016 for this type of game too and, unlike Civ5, you can actually tell what's happening on screen without having to use a weird strategy view.			"

												I own 3 copies of this game.  PC, MAC and Steam.  CIV IV is the benchmark of all Strategy Games I play.  Why did I buy it again on Steam?  Because I wanted to own it digitally and didn't want to have to worry about placing the disc in the CD ROM drive.  I've played this game for 10 years.  Oh and don't forget, Leonard Nimoy (Spock) narrates almost all the of the tech quotes.  This is a game that after you beat it you will come back and play it again and again on harder difficulties.  There are many scenarios too: China, America vs Great Britain.  In the Warlords edition you can play as Barbarians!			"

												In spite of the short time listed here, I actually have played hundreds, if not thousands of hours worth of Civilization IV.  It is, without a doubt, the best 4x game ever made.  That's not to disparage earlier greats in the genre, but Civ IV (particularly the BtS expansion) takes the concept to an extremely high form that would have been unthinkable on any earlier hardware.  The game play is deep, and with dozens of unique leader trait combos, several paths to victory, randomly generated maps, and tons of user mods, infinitely replayable.The only downsides of this game are its failure to use hexes, failure to have a genuine 3d (as in globe) map, and a particular game mechanic in the combat system that makes crushing the AIs fairly easy when facing even remotely even odds.There are religious, technological, corporate, political, cultural and military paths to victory.  Each civilization has both a unique unit and unique building, and each leader a unique set of two personality traits that affect gameplay significantly.  The game can be played on small maps, or gigantic.  It can be played in a quick speed - finishing in a couple hours - or in ""marathon"" speed, a game that can take several days to finish.  There are barbarian hordes that will smash your early civilization, and randomly generated events and quests to vary each game.It's so infinitely replayable in fact, that I am going to stfu, and go start a new game right now...

												Civilization is a particularly ancient series (excuse the unintentional irony) with a lot of prestige in its name brand and its benefactor, Mr. Meier. For the most part, each fan has their favourite game in the series past CivII, But Civilization IV in any case is my favourite one. With a wealth of content and a phenominal fanbase and modding scene, it stands as one of the most complete and interesting single-player games in existence, bar the somewhat clunky engine it runs on and the weak UI. Buy, play, mod, enjoy.			"

												Almost certainly my favorite game of all-time.  Seven years after BTS was released, I still play it avidly.  Although other games distract me from time-to-time, I always come back to CIV IV:BTS.    By itself, BTS is a fine game, and a decided improvement over vanilla Civ IV.  But the modding community is what keeps the game fresh and interesting.  Fall from Heaven II, Caveman2Cosmos, Planetfall, Realism Invictus, Rise of Mankind (to name just a few) - all are quality mods that change the dynamics of the game significantly to the point that they are almost entirely new 4X games in their own right.  Whenever I get bored with one mod, I'm always able to find another to try out, or an updated version of an old mod that I had previously discarded.For me, the most fun is exploring the map and the early quest for resources and dominance. After having achieved military, cultural, or economic superiority over the other Civs, however, the endgame often become tedious, and it is rare that I ever actually finish a game.   I don't have any experience with multiplayer, but even as a single player game, I love it.  If I had to erase all games from my Steam account and hard drive save one, CIV-IV BTS likely would be the keeper. "

Going to war, loosing cities, if your not well defended and gaining cities back and taking from other Civs, if you're a War King or Queen! :DMake your own custom games, different maps, and settings.You get so lost in time with this game. before you know it, lunch and dinner times gone and ur ordering a take away cuz you dont wanna get up to make food as you still wanna continue!  :D  Hours, days, and weeks of fun for a more than reasonable price!Buy it, Play it, and enjoy it!

There are issues: not being able to found a Republic unless you build the Great Pyramid or reach the Renaissance is just silly; the generation of Commerce and turning it into Gold and Beakers is pretty obtuse for new players; and representing cultures like the Zulu and Aztecs with only warlike leaders is basically racist erasure. Uprisings are depicted as things that prevent a 'side' from 'winning' or something that is incited by another 'side', with no option to pursue victory as a revolutionary leader. But as a game presented as a simplifed account of human history, it's enormously fun if you like playing a conqueror, technocrat or schemer.			"

												The year is 2374 ww6 ended only 4 empires are left China,France,Japan and me the Vikings everyone hates each other because of religion being confucianism in game. I think it all started when France was going to war with China because France was Taoist and China was Christian. Since I was in a alliance I declared war against France and France had The Holy Roman Empire as a alliance they also declared war againist me and China. The war Began in 1856 and ended 1967 the war really long 3 empires died the Holy Romans,Germany and Rome after that most empires hated me and china because Almost everyone was Friends with holy rome because they had coal and oil.Then ww1 began in 1979 with 7 empires left what would go wrong well I lost about half of my empire and China was also died. france basically  got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by Japan who surrounded them and Zulu and the Mongol empires died. So preety much after ww1 was just war none stop war only in 2028 - 2047 was peacefully but after that nukes, nukes everywhere and its ridiculous how many troops died. So Should I invade China they are really and now only with 3 citys I think they be destroyed in 10ish turns.			"

												This expansion of Civ 4 is one of my all-time favourite games. However, the reason for that is not the game itself, but because of the amazing mod, Rhye's and Fall of Civilization. I spent many hundreds of hours chugging away on that mod.			"

												I have been a Civ fan since Civ III, and I cannot decide which I like better: Civ IV or Civ V. So I made a list. Here goes:Civ VNo more stacks of death (you cannot stack units)- you must actualy be strategic when it comes to how you wage war: no more ""meh army bigger than ur army. i win."" Better graphics (if that matters to you: I could care less)Game is more basicReplaced gov types with culture branches... not sure which one I like more.Made culture/domonation victories winnable. The only way I could ever find a way to win in civ iv was space race. I'm still lost when it comes to deplomacy.City states: Single NPC cities that you can befriend or cature.They replaced the square tiles (from which you could move 8 directions) with hexes (from which you can move 6 directions).                   larger tech tree. Civ IVthey took away religion in Civ V! I loved the concept of religion, in my opinion they should have built upon it.They took away sickness! I loved the concept of bla bla bla ^^^They made it so that cities no longer become unhappy indivigualy, now the entire nation becomes ♥♥♥♥♥y at once. I liked the old way much better. cheeperSo there you go. Hope it helped. "

												At the beginning of the game, keep at least one warrior on your city, while you research Bronze Working. Once you've got that, build an archer, and fortify him on your city. Use your previously fortifying warrior to look for bronze. Once you find it, build a settler and make a city on/near the bronze. There, enjoy your swordsmen. That should make things easier for you.

												This game is excellent, simply put. Sure, it's really hard, but all games of the time were. When you got a game then, it was all about the single player. If it were short and easy, like most current games are, then it wouldn't have much substance and wouldn't be much fun. The controls take literally a minute to change to modern FPS controls, so you can't really complain about them. Unlike many current games, it actually has a decent story and good atmosphere. The game has aged surprisingly well over eleven years. To get an idea of what I mean, go back and play the original Half-Life. Amazing game, but looks so bad it's almost impossible to play. The RPG elements are implemented really well, and any level-ups make an immediate difference in the game. While the inventory system is kind of a pain, it's realistic and works well. There's a reason this game is often hailed as the best PC game of all time: it's excellent. If you don't like it, you don't know a good game when you play it!			"

Base game was a bit rough around the edges but the Beyond the Sword expansion definitely helped, adding more leaders, civs and units. Moddability's great too, giving you hundreds of extra hours of playtime through extra nations, scenarios or era mods.One of the best games I've ever played.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization has been the example of 4X games and Civ4 holds that legacy strong. Beyond the Sword is easily the best turn based strategy game I have ever had the pleasure of playing.Now, there is a caveat. This game is complicated and the expansions only make it more complicated. The appeal here is to a player who has an intellectual bent, who likes a game experience that takes its time and requires considerable attention to detail. Turns can take upwards of 15 minutes on a larger map with dozens of simultaneous factors to keep in mind. To me, that sounds like an engaging challenge where there's always something going on, but if it sounds like a tedius grind then this is not the game for you.			"

It's main feature, at least in my opinion, is that it adds 10 new civilizations, however the only ones I can remember right now are Native America (which is highly historically innacurate) and Ethiopia. Beyond the Sword's best scenerio is Final Fronteir. In it, the player is in space and it is wonderful!

												The game still looks good inspite of it's age, something that really helps it in this regard is how in the eraly game units will look different depending on what part of the world they come from, the faces of the various world leaders are expressive and really nice to look at.The combat in the game starts off pretty simple as mostly just rock paper scissors until the ages move on and new tech is made on these fronts, becoming more complicated with artillery and aircraft being thrown in to the mix.Building an empire is fun, as populations rise and cities and buildings are constructed the appearance of said cites change  in size with the various buildings being visable inside them.Researching technology is a neat experiance; every time you have completed on you will be given a lovingly narrated qoute and a short description of what you accomplished, and after certain techs are resaerched you will enter a new era that will be accompanied by a change in the ambience music will change along with the asthetics of your cites to signify the age your people live in.Espionoge mixes things up quite a bit, it gives you opportunites to see what your friends and rivals are resaerching and with enough intelligence you can do everything from poisoning the water hole to learning every single last move the target of your spies is making.Wonders are great buildings and monuments that offer special bonuses such as The Great Wall, which will prevent barbarians from entering certain parts of your borders, The Oracle, wich will give you a free tch of your choosing, and The Taj Mahal, which gives you a golden age- a event that lasts a number of turns which will give boosts to virtually everything.Another thing that can occur is the creation of Great People: Great Builders, Great Prophets, Great Merhcants, Great Generals, Great Artists, Great Scientists, and Great Spies. These guys can give you a variety of different boons from starting a corperation, expanding your borders, giving more experience to some of your units, and giving you a free tech.You can manage you system og government from it's humble beginnings of tribal barbarism to slavery, police states, free speech, state property, theocracy, etc. These can vary in terms of expense but can also effect what kind of special events that can occur along with how other nations view your country.Diplomacy is another thing that is simple at first but becomes far more complicated over time, between wars, religion, charity, various events, actions made by your friends, and many, many, other factors can change how the leaders of the world view you- or even how your own people see you.I think above all others however in importance is the world maps, randomly generated that still manage to retain a sense of organization and beauty that are never the same, your experience will be different every time you play.There are many other details that I think should be learned from playing or have been described by others, but it is mostly for the reasons I have described above that I have nominated this game for the Test of Time Award.

												Still the best Civilization game at least up until number 5. I haven't played Civ VI yet as I am a cheap♥♥♥♥♥who won't buy until it gets a sale. There are a couple of reason for this one being the best. One is that I find it a lot more accessible than Civilization V. There is less clutter and when it comes to the controls the square based map is just better suited for the numpad... And controlling with the mouse is a hassle. The second and to me far more important one is that Civilization V especially in the late games draws to an absolute stand still with the opponents taking their turns. I like big games on big maps with marathon length. In Civ 5 every computer turn takes 1-2 minutes meaning that an endgame of 100 turns (which is a conservative estimate) takes upwards of 3 hours of me doing absolutely nothing but waiting. In Civ 4 the computer turns on my system never takes more than 10 seconds meaning I spend a lot more time playing and a lot less waiting. I have heard Civ players telling me basically I'm too impatient. But if I can actually go make a cup of coffee between every turn in the late game I'm not playing a game. I'm drinking coffee with the game as sort of a distraction.			"

												Loved this game. Played it exclusivley until civ V got Gods & Kings. In terms of pure gameplay,  Beyond the sword Beats vanilla civ V in every aspect other than warfare. Now its rather difficult to justify the purchase of Beyond the sword with Brave new world out for Civ V, which should be regarded as the definitive civ game (lets ignore Beyond Earth, not really a 'civ' game). If you see this on sale with civ iv (which you need as BTS is not standalone) pick it up for the pure nostalgia feel. If you are new to the Civilization franchise, try Civ V and its expansions over this. 9/10 many many hours to be taken from this. On the disc non-steam version i had of this, i must of put hundreds if not a thousand hours into this game!			"

												Of all the addons for Civilization 4, Beyond the Sword is my favourite. It's main feature, at least in my opinion, is that it adds 10 new civilizations, however the only ones I can remember right now are Native America (which is highly historically innacurate) and Ethiopia. Beyond the Sword's best scenerio is Final Fronteir. In it, the player is in space and it is wonderful! Beyond the Sword would be FAR better with achievments.Ignore the ""2 Hours,"" I've played A LOT more but not on Steam.			"

												If I could I'd give this game a neutral. I've played it alot pre-Steam and have played Civ since the first one. But they all suffer from the same problem, random game crashes. It's frustrating and annoying and if you load a save after a crash (game has stopped working), it'll crash at exactly the same spot. Start a new one, may or may not crash or may crash at a random time. Nobody knows why. Also, if your save is greater then 1.3 megs, you'll never be able to load it. And when it's nearing that, a crash is coming soon. Curse of 32-bit applications. Until the Civ games get out of the stone age and move to 64-bit........Otherwise, I like this over Civ 5, you can stack lots of units (last game, had around 25 units in a stack). Civ's don't care if you found cities next to them or not, or how many. You can build spies and unleash them on your enemies, destroying  everything from improvements to poisoning water.You can aquire other Civ' cities thru culture, instead of war. The more religions you have, the better, unlike Civ 5's religion intolerance to other religions. Overall, the game is fun, that is when it's working correctly and not dumping you to the desktop..

												You know, it doesn't matter which one of these Sid Meiers Civilization games you play, they are ALWAYS conquest games. You inevitably have to build a huge military in order to stop the computer players from attacking you, and then MAYBE, you can try and play for one of the other victory conditions. I have yet to have found any of them that allow for anything but. I just quit a game because 3 out of 6 computer opponents all attacked me. One of them managed to march 3 absurdly huge stacks through 3 other computer opponents to do so. This is NOT a reasonable design. This is a Firaxis game flaw that has been woefully apparrent in every one of their titles. Instead of creating an A.I. that is capable of defining it's own goals, the A.I. is designed to attack the human player, period. They never got past that. I can't tell you the number of games I have played and quit because the A.I., instead of following a strategy that would actually be in their best interest, has moved settlers across the map just to settle next to me, the human player. Obviously the team at Firaxis simply cannot figure out after 20 years of game design how to create an A.I that is capable of actually playing a competent game without having to resort to game cheats and silly decision algorithms			"

												Not a bad try, but still worse then Civ3 in many ways. I think Civs are just getting worse on each number. They should repair and improve the old ones instead. Still a good game, but feels like you do not even have to play it, as the game gets either so big that it is awful to micro, and it feels the ages and technologies and whatnot are just passing by. So if you have an enemy, you could basically choose to attack him with axemen or invent the Internet and visit Mars. Then you would have destroyed your enemy and lost to all others, or you would be stuck with your enemy and developed. It does not reflect the Civ feel as well as 1-2-3, but is better than 5.			"

												I must say with all the Positive reviews from everyone i cant seem to grasp what is good about this game, i realize i have very few hours into this game, but that is simply because it cannot hold my attention for more than 5 minutes... the moving of units and clumsy and makes no logical sense (you can move units 4 squares at a time diagnolly, but only 2 at a time side to side or up and down) which makes moving diagnolly the ONLY viable option when moving armies or exploring (which in my opinion alone, kill the early game of exploring to me), i have watched youtube video after youtube video and basically the only option i see in everyones ""lets plays"" are all military conquests. every seingle time ive started a game,even on the easiest difficulty,  by the time youve researched 1 technology, and built one unit/building, the AI is already 2 techs in, with several buildings or several units, there seems to be no way in order to build an early economy without leaving all cities empty for takeover, the only thing this game seems to have for it, is decent mid to late game politic customization, (your goverment styles etc), i find this game you have to FORCE yourself to play, and when you do, it doesnt make me feel like im building an empire my way, so much as following the strict guidelines in order to make an empire (to me, its as if every time you play the game, you have to use the exact same strategy and build every time) and from ""lets plays"" ive watched everyone builds basically the same way anyway, (use workers to put cottages on your plots, and built military units exclusively), so yes the game has a LOT of customizable features, that are basically formatted to only be usefull when you customize a specific wayif you want an enjoyable empire building game, get Civ5 with the expansions (where you can actually maximize on every aspect of the game in one match...yes, there is not as many features in civ5 as civ4, however they flow together SOOOO much more smoothly, you can play a game on diety (the hardest setting), and with enough experience, you CAN lead in culture, science, happiness, religion, city size, army size, basically actually create a ""world superpower"" unlike in civ4 where you basically are ""only culture"" or ""only science"" or ""only military"" etc etc, civ5 gives you much more realistic wars as theres no ridiculous unit stacking where you have all your units in one square to build one unkillable unit, in civ5 you actually HAVE to use movement strategies, and the layout of the land to win wars, not just send your one unit that takes next to no damage, and kills everything in one hit. i cannot comprehend the appreciations of civ4 when theres civ5  that actually makes you want to play. where as civ4 just makes me want to hit alt-f4 and play ANY other game in my library (and yes, ive tried to make myself enjoy civ4 as empire building games are my favourite style of genre. bottom line, Civ5 is infinitely times greater than civ4.

												While this is not a universal truth, I believe that a strategy game where only on strategy can be used to win is in essence: NOT a strategy game. The reality is that in Civlization IV vanilla, defence is kind of possible, but needs a LOT of effort and is not ultimatly worth it because your score point generation falls off the map while producing military units you will not use to take a capital/city. However, in BTS this is even worse because defence is not even possible. You must research knights to counter catapults? wtf. The research is only like 1000 years apart. The only stategy available in Civ IV is: ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK! If that is how I wanted to play then I would play a fricken RTS. (Real Time Strategy) Like AoM, Warcraft III, or Starcraft. The fact that this grind for military units is the only way to play makes all other parts of the game more like a dissapointing minigame you pursue while everyones LotR size hordes hump eachother in the field. If you pursue a science victory you essentially are achieving a military victory, but decided to make a spaceship while your nukes were in transit to your enemies loved ones. So, once again I state: A strategy game with one strategy is not strategy game at all. Don't really want to be identified as a Civ V fan boy, but yes they fixed this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in Civ V and you can actually enjoy 5 different victory goals. (if you buy all the expansions that is, otherwise the vanilla game is the same meatgrinder of military units you wait on, while you fap or look at reddit) So, do not buy this game unless you want to have stacks of units slap eachother until one loses the strength to go on. If you still want to buy this game, buy it on {LINK REMOVED}www♥♥♥♥♥com for a $6 steam code intead of fricken $30-35 on steam, or what ever its up to now with the Civ VI announcement.I am sorry Leonard Nimoy.

I also love the resource gathering and the tech trees. My biggest problem with these games (and Civ IV specifically) is when my Modern Armor unit dies to a Russian Longbowman. I shouldn't be penalized because my civilization advanced faster than someone else's. A modern era tank > anyone carrying a bow and arrow. At that point my immersion was gone and so was the enjoyment.Sorry, Sid. You got this one wrong.			"

												This game was amazing, even though it was outdated when I got it, I imagined it was still better than Civ 5, which I haven't played, but whatever. Mostly, I played the multiplayer. There were three of us, me and two of my friends, usually against two or three AI. I could trust one but there was so much paranoia between me and the other friend that every game we played, most of the time I ended up taking him out or nuking him at least. He would literally sell his soul to the devil to gain a single relationship boost, which is why I never wanted to trade with him. But as I said, the game WAS amazing. I would have recommended the game a few months ago (Don't think update was out then), but with the latest update, the multiplayer is SO laggy, I'm considering uninstalling my game. For my friend Cole's birthday, I got him 20 bucks so he could finally play the game with us (which he wanted for a while but never had the cash), and so he bought it. But we haven't played more than 30 minutes worth with him just because of the lag. I don't know what caused all of the lag, but it was a terrible terrible thing. I'm glad the servers are still up but for me and my friends, there's no point now. I did get my money's worth and I don't regret getting the game, but as much as I hate to say it, I wouldn't recommend anyone getting it now if they want to play it with friends.			"

												I tried to like it.  I really did.  I tried.  But it isn't as fun as Civilization V for me.  I know it is a 2005-2006 game, but the graphics look circa-1998,  I should know, I play Command and Conquer.Pros:Fast gameplayGlobal WarmingCons:Confusing UIHorrible GraphicsImpossible Attacking SystemAnnoying MusicImpossible Happiness SystemUnrealistic Religion FoundingI rate this game 2/10.

												If you thought Civ 5 was disappointing, (as i did), this adds nothing to change your mind.  I was suckered into thinking it was going to be drastically better by the metascores and reviews.  Awful decision.  Still hated it.  It's merely a more complex version of the terd it has always been.			"

Overall impression is very good.I enjoyed getting back into Civ with Civ 3 recently and I hadn't played since Civ 1. That was in 1992 on an Atari STE.Seems I've come full circle with Civ 4 after playing Total War games.Civ 3 is still good and this is just as good as that. I can't compare with Civ 5 because I haven't played that.With what is included in this package with Colonazation thrown in as well it certainly is value for money even at full price.

You can lots of mods as well - these include Final Frontier (space related), Afterworld (zombie thing) and lots more! And if you do want to play normal Civ 4, then there are more leaders and units to choose from. And, in addition, random disasters.

												Civilization IV is probably my most played game of all time.  I suspect less man hours were put into planning some land invasions.  Beyond the Sword is the expansion pack that made everything about Civilization IV better, plus is necessary for some of the really good mods outs there such as Fall from Heaven.So, I am certainly going to recommend it.  It is a strategy game that got a lot right.  The gameplay mechanics encourage expansion, but simultaneously impose reasonable limts.  New technologies can alter the way the game is played, making a very different strategic picture through railroads, airplanes, and democracy.  The religion mechanic adds great flavor and some interesting gameplay.  Diplomacy is easy to understand, but hard to exploit.There are some flaws.  Get to far behind and you've lost, even if it takes another 100 years for the axe to actually fall.  The end game becomes a bit to grindy with units becoming to common.  Still, the hundreds of hours I've spent playing this game is a testament to both its addictiveness and its quality.			"

												9.9/10All of the Civ games have taken a huge amount of time out of my life and I would say that every hour was worth it. Civ IV is my favorite installment in the series and BTS is by far my favorite variation of it. If you're wondering what makes BTS different from regular Civ IV, the difference is that BTS combines all of the exra features from expansions like Warlords and then adds a lot more: new units, buildings, wonders, AI and features such as events and new mods and scenarios. It is basically everything from the Civ IV era combined into one game. It is also one of my favorite games and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Civ or strategy games in general.			"

												This game was an incredible timesink throughout my adventures in PC gaming, I am having waves of nostalgia as I write this. To keep the review short (since this game is very old), this is, in my opinion, the best civilization game I've played. The game is much more chaotic than Civilization V, with armies able to occupy one tile. This leads to some frightening scenarios. For example, you could be minding your own buisness as a modern civilization, and then a horde of Mongolian trebuchets can decend upon your cities (this is from experience). Ultimately, I recommend at least looking at this game if you enjoy any other Civilization games, and as the best piece of DLC (in my opinion), this is the most valuable Civilization IV bit.			"

												I have not played the previous version. But I have played the sequel. I like this one more for several reasons. Its style, mode, and mechanics. The random events really are interesting, but the need to balance culture, research, and espionage through sliders makes the game. It forces you to build things in a certain order, and to expand quickly. The new Civilization does not include this, and although it uses newer hardware and a different engine, it has a much different look. Choose this version if you want a more realistic civilization strategy game.			"

												Civ IV is my most played game ever, and a pinnacle of the strategy genre. I have installed it on every computer I have owned since it came out. The Steam play time reflects that I played from my CD-ROM copy of CIV 4 complete until recently when my install discs became incompatible with Windows 10. I feel that the Civ 4 gameplay is the most balanced and addictive of Civ 4 series games, with strong ai, diplomacy, building, expansion, religion, commerce, and war all providing great depth that makes playing just one more turn addictive. In my opnion, only the great Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri has comparable all around strengths and innovations for its time, Moreover, Civ 4 has given me unparalleled replay value because it is the most modable Civ game.  Besides the usual tweaks of the vanilla game on can find in Civ 5, Civ 4's structure enabled the creation of many complete overhaul mods that transformed CIv 4 with new gameplay and graphics, including historical, fantasy, and sci-fi mods. For example, in my opinion, the Civ 4 fantasy mod, Fall From Heaven 2, remains of one of the best 4x strategy fantasy pc games ever made. Civ IV, however, does show its age when compared to more refined interface of Civ V. Civ 4's maps of square titles and battles with stacks of units on the same tile, also give a less sophisticated first impression. However, when I compare the gameplay between Civ 4 and Civ 5, I find Civ 4 AI is usually more challenging, sophisticated, and strategically effective than in Civ 5, with regard to both combat and non-combat activities alike.Install Civ 4 complete (Civ IV, Civ IV Warlords, and Civ IV Beyond the Sword) and join the addiction!Note: I have reviewed Civ 4 and its expansions as a single game.

												awawawawawawawawawawwawawawawawawawawawawawa[EDIT][I just saw this review and I consider it to be lacking]400 hours of Civ IV later, I can still recommend this to you, I have not gone insane. It's a classic turn-based empire game with real charm, character and a grammy winning theme song. Voiced by Lenard Nimoy, and emblazoned with the Sid Meier's logo, this game is almost a must own for any self respecting human being.Although, some people might think that this game is slow and boring. And yes, if you play on marathon mode, or long mode or even normal mode, you can satisfy a whole week's worth of game time in just one save file.But, and this but is a Nicki Minaj scale but, turn the turn speed up to quick, set the world size to small, with random terrain generation and a full house of 16 civs, and watch your hour-or-so long chaotic power struggle ensue.Of course, if you were looking for a more epic game, the RevDCM mod pack alongside one of the larger scale earth maps, or a huge scale random map, will set you up for one of the most enjoyable empire building sim game experiences you can get.To round up, a flexible game with stunning audio, that can be tailored and played to pretty much anyone's needs. A great game and worth picking up.			"

												Best expansion for the best PC game out there. The base game, Civilization IV, is great. It is a really in depth ""civilization simulator."" You take control of a civilization starting at the dawn of time all the way to the modern era and beyond. The game is very in depth with all of the options at your disposal for how you manage your government, economy, religion, espionage, foreign policy, and many other factors. You can be Gandhi and set up a fascist theocracy with a socialist economy and nuke everyone on the planet. There is a lot of literature out there about how spectacular this game is so I’ll just stop here.One of the few flaws is the combat. It is all percentage based, so you can get in some pretty frustrating situations. Maybe you go into a battle where you have and 80+ percent chance of winning, but there is still a chance you can lose. Even at 97+percent I’ve lost some times. This combat system is extremely frustrating when you “get haxed” and lose on battle you should have won. Another issue is that in late game the combat really just becomes “who can have the most units crammed into a tile.” Your (and your opponents’) empire will get so big and have so much production that it becomes quite cumbersome to manage a war with all the military units you’ll have around. Since you can fit literally infinite units in one space, it really becomes a contest of who can get the biggest army and march from city to city. These flaws pale in comparison to how great and addicting this game is, however.This expansion, beyond the sword, is the best. It adds even more units, buildings, and civilizations to the game. Also, it comes pre-loaded with some of the best mods, including Rhye’s and Fall of Civilization, which takes this game to a whole new level. Over all it’s as close to a 10/10 game I have ever seen. You won’t regret spending the money to buy this, especially when it is on sale.			"

												Civ IV: Beyond the Sword is the ultimate version of the now-classic Strategy title.The game offers a turn-based look at history from the stone age to modern times, as is the case with all Civ games. What sets IV apart from the rest of the series is the sheer depth of the different mechanics that the player must manage to be successful. These include, but are not limited to: Economy, Military, Population, Health, Technology, and Espionage. With all of that work to do across the different eras of human history, it is easy to say that the turns you take in Civ IV will be longer than any other in the series.How you deal with this fact is up to your personal preference. However, one thing is certain, Civ IV is extremely well streamlined, and even new players will be right at home with the mechanics with a modicum of perseverence. As someone who struggled with Civ III, I had fully grasped the mechanics of Civ IV by my tenth hour of gameplay: easy to learn, hard to master.Ultimately, I recommend this game wholeheartedly to strategy fans. If you have Civ V, consider this the wise granddaddy of that great game. It is a wholly different and in some ways far more rewarding experience. If you have never played a Civ game before, Civ IV is a deeper choice, though if you are impatient and seek a more casual experience, the excellent Civ V is recommended.			"

Playing Vanilla Civ IV after a good match of Fall from Heaven 2 (look it up its awesome) makes you feel like half the game is missing. Some loyal fans put a lot of time into this game to make it even better. Appreciate their hard work.			"

												Civ IV: Beyond the Sword is the ultimate version of the now-classic Strategy title.The game offers a turn-based look at history from the stone age to modern times, as is the case with all Civ games. What sets IV apart from the rest of the series is the sheer depth of the different mechanics that the player must manage to be successful. These include, but are not limited to: Economy, Military, Population, Health, Technology, and Espionage. With all of that work to do across the different eras of human history, it is easy to say that the turns you take in Civ IV will be longer than any other in the series.How you deal with this fact is up to your personal preference. However, one thing is certain, Civ IV is extremely well streamlined, and even new players will be right at home with the mechanics with a modicum of perseverence. As someone who struggled with Civ III, I had fully grasped the mechanics of Civ IV by my tenth hour of gameplay: easy to learn, hard to master.Ultimately, I recommend this game wholeheartedly to strategy fans. If you have Civ V, consider this the wise granddaddy of that great game. It is a wholly different and in some ways far more rewarding experience. If you have never played a Civ game before, Civ IV is a deeper choice, though if you are impatient and seek a more casual experience, the excellent Civ V is recommended.			"

												The game may be old, but that doesn't matter. Civ IV: BTS is a great game, from choosing awesome leaders like Sitting Bull or Augustus Caesar, down to having the liberty to play your music in the game. The complaints I would have are that the espionage can be ridiculously unbalanced as well as the battle system (Warrior v Tank, warrior wins because of hill). Great people generation fails, Great prophets are the only thing I seem to get, and I would like to have a custom history system, to view my games like real history. Scenarios like Rhyse and Fall alone make up for these, which allows you to view history and see if you can Rhyse to glory, and not Fall to despair.			"

												Civilzation 4 contiunes to raise the bar from the previous civilization games. The game is streamlined in a good way, while keeping the depth of strategy of the previous titles. Religion adds a new dimension to the game in huge ways. Every country is unique and has advantages and disadvanteges, you can find one to suite your playstyle or difficulty curve. The graphics, the soundtrack and the technology quotes (done by lenoard nemoy) are all excellent. If I had one complaint, it would be the difficulty. I have played CiV2, Civ3 and alpha centrai. I can say with certinty that the AI is much harder in this game. In previous games I could win on the hardest settings. In this game I lose on the easy settings. This can get frustrating as you can easilly sink at least three hours into one game and lose. The music can also get repetive as there are not many songs in the soundtrack.This game is worth every penny, if you liked other Civ games get it!			"

												Best expansion for the best PC game out there. The base game, Civilization IV, is great. It is a really in depth ""civilization simulator."" You take control of a civilization starting at the dawn of time all the way to the modern era and beyond. The game is very in depth with all of the options at your disposal for how you manage your government, economy, religion, espionage, foreign policy, and many other factors. You can be Gandhi and set up a fascist theocracy with a socialist economy and nuke everyone on the planet. There is a lot of literature out there about how spectacular this game is so I’ll just stop here.One of the few flaws is the combat. It is all percentage based, so you can get in some pretty frustrating situations. Maybe you go into a battle where you have and 80+ percent chance of winning, but there is still a chance you can lose. Even at 97+percent I’ve lost some times. This combat system is extremely frustrating when you “get haxed” and lose on battle you should have won. Another issue is that in late game the combat really just becomes “who can have the most units crammed into a tile.” Your (and your opponents’) empire will get so big and have so much production that it becomes quite cumbersome to manage a war with all the military units you’ll have around. Since you can fit literally infinite units in one space, it really becomes a contest of who can get the biggest army and march from city to city. These flaws pale in comparison to how great and addicting this game is, however.This expansion, beyond the sword, is the best. It adds even more units, buildings, and civilizations to the game. Also, it comes pre-loaded with some of the best mods, including Rhye’s and Fall of Civilization, which takes this game to a whole new level. Over all it’s as close to a 10/10 game I have ever seen. You won’t regret spending the money to buy this, especially when it is on sale.			"

												9.9/10All of the Civ games have taken a huge amount of time out of my life and I would say that every hour was worth it. Civ IV is my favorite installment in the series and BTS is by far my favorite variation of it. If you're wondering what makes BTS different from regular Civ IV, the difference is that BTS combines all of the exra features from expansions like Warlords and then adds a lot more: new units, buildings, wonders, AI and features such as events and new mods and scenarios. It is basically everything from the Civ IV era combined into one game. It is also one of my favorite games and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Civ or strategy games in general.			"

The complexity of the game is daunting to some, but it is easy to learn - yet hard to master - like any skill-based game.With random world generation and around 20 civilizations to play, along with a sliding scale for challenge level and multiplayer options, potential replayability is high for anyone looking to get deeply involved in complex strategy.5/5. 10/10. 100/100.

												This older version of Civilization really is still worth playing. The narration is proved by Leonard Nimoy, which will never be bested. There are some really nice short animations showing the construction of your ancient wonders and its a shame they didn't make more of these for Civilization V. The gameplay hasn't changed much other than the tiles being sqaure rather than hexagonal. Strategy games don't get much better than this.			"

												The game may be old, but that doesn't matter. Civ IV: BTS is a great game, from choosing awesome leaders like Sitting Bull or Augustus Caesar, down to having the liberty to play your music in the game. The complaints I would have are that the espionage can be ridiculously unbalanced as well as the battle system (Warrior v Tank, warrior wins because of hill). Great people generation fails, Great prophets are the only thing I seem to get, and I would like to have a custom history system, to view my games like real history. Scenarios like Rhyse and Fall alone make up for these, which allows you to view history and see if you can Rhyse to glory, and not Fall to despair.			"

												Part of the legendary *Civilization series*, this turn-based strategy (TBS) games reward careful planning. Unlike its newer sibling, Civilizations 5, Civ IV allows you to fine tune every aspect of your civilization. For some, this means tedious micromanagement. But for people who like fine-grained control (a.k.a., 'control freaks', like me), this game is much better than (the much-simplified) Civ 5.The ""Beyond the Sword"" (BtS) expansion is not only a bugfix of the previous Civilizations IV releases, but also introduces some 'twist' to the gameplay. In addition to the 'Great Generals' units of Civ IV Warlords, BtS expands on the importance of Espionage, and the introduction of the 'Corporations' allows players a 'second attempt' at 'religion', but with more devastating economic effects.Simply put: If you're not a twitch gamer, but a strategic gamer who likes deep, encompassing games, then this game is for you.

But anyways, it really is a good game, the graphics are nice, the stratagy is really in depth, and there are a large amount of countries and leaders to chose from.

												Possibly my favorite gameplay-focused game of all time. Civ4 is absolutely one of the most accessible and yet simultaneously the most complex strategy games I've ever played. And it's FUN, it's just so much darn fun. The idea of building up an empire over a large span of time isn't all that novel, but Civ4 pulls it off so well that I can't complain.Civ4 is the perfect game to play with friends, provided your friends have any sort of attention span. But it's not just that, I've lost entire days just playing Civ4 all by myself. It's so much fun to change things up, to force myself to play different ways. And it's not just the different victory types; changing anything from the map to the number of players to the settings can completely alter the way the game plays out. I've done all sorts of weird stuff, like a highest difficulty game where all forms of victory are off except time limit and my goal is just to survive until 2050.I can't recommend this game enough. It's really great.			"

												First (and only) Civ game I ever played, so I can only compare it to vanilla and warlords. It's definitely better and more in-depth than either of those with many more choices and features. I can also, of course, compare to other games in general, in which case it is well above average.The mods are pretty cool and very interesting and keep it fresh when you get bored of regular games. The one negative I can think of now is that, no matter how much I hear to the contrary, I'm still convinced the A.I. cheats! This can be very frustrating, especially when you've put dozens of hours into a game only to get destroyed, or lose in a ridiculous manner, by some civ that has some stuff/things that you're convinced they shouldn't. Either that or they make a decision that seems to make no sense, in terms of benefitting themselves, at all.Still brilliant though! and I can definitely see why they call it the 'just one more turn' effect.

												This review is... hard, not because it's a bad game or mixed, mostly because despite how many hours I put in on it, the amount of Civ V I've played since has forced almost all of IV out of my mind. From the vague memories I have, it was a lot of fun, but V was better in every way (after V got the expansions). I would play this all the time with my ex in college back then. But for a real review, it's Civ, if you liked II, III, or I, you'll enjoy IV. It still has stacks of doom and is a fantastic game. However nowadays V is generally preferred and recommended. IV should only be played with all the expansions as well. If I were reviewing this 8-10 years ago, I'd probably rate it even higher, but there are better games out.9.0/10			"

												Civ 6 has just come out, and has not yet dislodged Civ 4 as the best in a long lasting series.  The depth and complexities that are included in Civ 4 make the decisions made in both 5 and 6 pale in comparison.  The most common criticism of 4 is the doom stacks that it is possible to make, and yet doom stacks are simple to take care of using simple mechanics.  This is also the last version of Civ that the AI was capable of playing.  The one thing that I would complain about is the square tiles.  Hex tiles were a fantastic upgrade over square.  However, between a competent AI, decisions that feel like they make a difference, the ability to make an empire larger than 4 cities, and meaningful diplomacy, I do not think this game will be surpassed any time soon.

												CIV 4 and BTS are one of my favorite games of all time, according to steam ive put 500+ hours in the game (about 1/6th of my total playtime from my original discs). Currently I play with the original release beta option, doing this allows me to use hamachi and play with people that dont have the steam version. Theirs still semi-active 3rd party mods, maps and scripts for this game you can find on civfanatics if you start loosing intrest in the game.			"

												After playing Civ 1,2,3 and only watching Civ 5 i decided to give Civ4 a chance. I played it for a couple of hours and have to say for it's age Civ4 is 7.5/10 Graphics and music could be better. Gameplay is very good but barbarians and CPU Civs are very hostile and like to forward settle. I place a city and next thing you know they come and they found their new city directly on the border of mine. By doing that they take my luxuries and strategic resources.			"

												This review is... hard, not because it's a bad game or mixed, mostly because despite how many hours I put in on it, the amount of Civ V I've played since has forced almost all of IV out of my mind. From the vague memories I have, it was a lot of fun, but V was better in every way (after V got the expansions). I would play this all the time with my ex in college back then. But for a real review, it's Civ, if you liked II, III, or I, you'll enjoy IV. It still has stacks of doom and is a fantastic game. However nowadays V is generally preferred and recommended. IV should only be played with all the expansions as well. If I were reviewing this 8-10 years ago, I'd probably rate it even higher, but there are better games out.9.0/10			"

												This is definitely my favorite civ game (haven't tried 6 yet).  I have many more hours on record than what it shows here.  The reason I thoroughly enjoy this is because of the nuts and bolts.  The tech tree, various military unit types, and the way you have to manage resources is much more interesting and fulfilling.  Also, the wonders just seem to make more sense in this game.  The only major drawback is the giant stacks that the AI throws at you, but generally if you're keeping an eye on your enemy and build your military accordingly, you can deal with it, except on the brutally hard levels.Civ 5 combat is certainly more fun, but everything else in Civ 4 is more fun imo.  Have yet to check out 6, and never played 3 or prior.			"

												The already amazing Civilization IV becomes so much better with BTS. Beyond the Sword adds ten new civilizations (examples: Korea, Byzantine, Holy Rome), 5 new leaders (examples: Lincoln, Stalin), some scenarios from modders of Civilization IV (including the fantastic Rhye's and Fall of Civilization, or RFC), and gameplay additions that make the game funner and more addicting than the original Civilization IV. RFC is amazing. In RFC, you can choose a civ, and play as them, in world history. You can also change history - for example, the Germans winning World War II, or the Mongolian Empire reaching from Africa to China. I have to criticize, though, that, if you want to play as, say, the Americans, I am pretty sure you have to select another Civ and play as them until 1775. But other than that, RFC is good! But not as good as BTS itself.A++. GET THIS IF YOU HAVE CIV IV, OR GET CIV IV COMPLETE!			"

												Occasionally, along comes a game more demanding than the most lusty of succubi; a game that will truly suck the essence out of you, and you love every minute of it. Civilization 4 was such a game; from the moment you played your first turn, you knew it would claim far more of your time and energy than you were sure you had to give. Just one more turn? No, just one hundred more. And now that the latest expansion has dropped, it's time to re-evaluate your schedule once again.Before we launch straight into all the new stuff, let's get the game's most noticeable flaw out of the way: Leonard Nimoy is no longer the voice for the game's pithy quotations. And since the tech tree has been considerably changed up, you'll be hearing Sid Meier's voice, and not Nimoy's very early in the game. Sid's a nice guy and all, but he's no Mr. Spock.The expansion brings with it a host of changes, additions, and re-balances of Civilization 4's old formula. The benefits of the previous expansion, Civilization 4: Warlords, are rolled right in as well. Among the new systems are the espionage system, the corporation system, an advanced start system, and an army of new combat options. This is before we even look at all the new scenarios and mods that come packed on the disc.Espionage makes for an interesting addition to the game. Unlike the somewhat awkward spy unit of pre-expansion Civ 4, the re-worked espionage system provides for a variety of different options. By spending espionage points, which are generated much as research points are, you can work on counter-espionage, foment rebellions, gather information, attempt to steal technologies, sabotage buildings in opponents' cities, influence local civics and religion, or even poison the local watering hole. Most of these require you to send a spy along to a target city, but there are still some passive benefits to building up espionage points, most of which are just gaining inside information on your foes' activities. The espionage system doesn't really require you micromanage carefully, so it's a pretty rewarding system all around. While you shouldn't be expecting to watch James Bond murder his way through the Soviet Union to make certain your civilization comes out ahead, it's nice to know he's on your side.Excuse me a moment, I have to conquer Mongolia.[3 hours later] Crap, it's that late already? Alright, well, let's talk about one of the other new systems quick – the random world events. The addition makes a lot of difference to the game, and they're worked in amazingly well, frequently playing off of the events that are already ongoing in the game. Random events pop up due to wars between civilizations of different religions, over-farming, failed royal marriages, or just plain chaotic weather patterns. In a lot of respects, the random events are reminiscent of Galactic Civilizations 2, though they generally feel more balanced and less arbitrary.Some of the new systems don't go over as well, though. The corporate system in Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword presents an almost nightmarish window into our own corporate structures. Founding a corporation is an interesting proposition, as it may very well harm you more than it benefits you. Corporations can potentially generate massive profits, but they take a great person, access to specific resources, and a fair amount of startup capital to get off the ground. Even after that, they can end up costing a lot to maintain, and getting rid of them is hard. Spread a branch office to your foe, however, and suddenly the maintenance burden is lessened, because your neighbor is now shouldering some of it. It's a weird, and eerily accurate, process, where frequently no one but the corporation really profits much. When you feng shui your trade routes, resources, expenditures, and diplomatic relations just right, however, corporations can generate an impressive amount of income – finding and maintaining those balances is the trick, and it's not a simple one. Overall, corporations can be far more trouble than they're really worth, so players that aren't trying to eke every last benefit out of the game should really just stay away from 'em.The combat refinements - including some considerable changes to artillery units - change up warfare in some interesting ways. The new specialized units bring some flair, and can help define some civilizations' preferred ages. Likewise, the new rulers (and in the case of Rome, a change in the ruler) also help spice things up in some interesting ways, and help to provide an even more varied experience. The new changes and additions help the game's replay value immensely – though it's not as though it was needed in the first place.Hang on, Egypt's getting uppity again...[Another 3 hours later] Well, I'm happy to report that the pharaohs have made friends with my cannon balls. A few rounds through their fancy stone walls, and suddenly we're the best of buds again! Hatshetsup was positively grinning when she heard I wasn't going to put holes in the roof of her palace – but it's not cause she asked me real pretty, it's because she always serves the best beer at her diplomatic functions.The A.I. in Civilization 4 has been revamped immensely with the new expansion – for once, you can't win the game just by keeping up with the science and agreeing to the occasional demand. When I first took up Civilization 4, I got into the habit of playing on ""Emperor"" difficulty level and doing alright for myself, but Beyond the Sword has forced me to scale back to ""Noble"" to break even, and ""Warlord"" to do well for myself. Between the new complications and the much cleverer A.I. opponents, I've found the game to be a renewed challenge, and a heck of a lot more fun. Given that the game was already siphoning off shreds of my very soul to power its dark simulations, I fear I might need the services of a preacher before I'll rid myself of this game. What's worse is that I'm not even clear I'll want to get that exorcism.Getting away from all that's new to the gameplay, the expansion also comes packed with a variety of mods and new scenarios. Some are great. Some are really quite bad. There's a total conversion packaged with the game that's frankly terrible; it attempts to be some kind of tactical RPG, but ultimately comes off as a clunky turn-based strategy game with ugly units. Though it's interesting to see what can be done with the platform that Civilization 4 was built upon, it's a poor addition to the expansion. There's also a fantasy total conversion packed in, which fares reasonably, though will likely not distract you much from the main game. The varying new scenarios and little mods add some extra amusement to the game, especially the Next War mod, which expands into futuristic, sci-fi technologies.Overall, Civilization 4: Beyond the Sword presents a lot of additions to what was already a great game. It's a good expansion, and capitalizes a great deal on fixing some of the weaknesses of the original. That said, the expansion doesn't do anything that will make someone who did not already enjoy Civilization games dance for joy. The expansion is absolutely great.			"

												Every time I go back to this game, I think, ""I've played way too much of this game."" Then I just shrug and start playing another 4 hours of the game. This game is great for people who like strategy or just for people who like messing around and declaring war on your friends. It takes very long to complete a whole game, but I think it's worth it if you have a few hours to kill. The world builder feature is quite fun to mess around with, it makes it easy to launch your enemies back to the stone age and give yourself an army of lions, but it's also fun to take the long route and build up a world religion, an army, a huge economy, or scienctific discoveries.

												The already amazing Civilization IV becomes so much better with BTS. Beyond the Sword adds ten new civilizations (examples: Korea, Byzantine, Holy Rome), 5 new leaders (examples: Lincoln, Stalin), some scenarios from modders of Civilization IV (including the fantastic Rhye's and Fall of Civilization, or RFC), and gameplay additions that make the game funner and more addicting than the original Civilization IV. RFC is amazing. In RFC, you can choose a civ, and play as them, in world history. You can also change history - for example, the Germans winning World War II, or the Mongolian Empire reaching from Africa to China. I have to criticize, though, that, if you want to play as, say, the Americans, I am pretty sure you have to select another Civ and play as them until 1775. But other than that, RFC is good! But not as good as BTS itself.A++. GET THIS IF YOU HAVE CIV IV, OR GET CIV IV COMPLETE!			"

												I have not played the previous version. But I have played the sequel. I like this one more for several reasons. Its style, mode, and mechanics. The random events really are interesting, but the need to balance culture, research, and espionage through sliders makes the game. It forces you to build things in a certain order, and to expand quickly. The new Civilization does not include this, and although it uses newer hardware and a different engine, it has a much different look. Choose this version if you want a more realistic civilization strategy game.			"

												A few years ago CNN did a fun little written piece that identified Sid Meier as the “Father” of computer gaming.  Now the rest of the article was rather dull, but this first part was, at least, quite accurate.  And if Sid is the “Father” than “Civilization 4” is his son sent to save us in our time of need.On a serious note.  This is the best Sid Meier Game EVER! No contest.  Along with a dumbfounding number of  AAA, “5 Star” quality mods (Fall From Heaven, Rise Of Mankind, etc …) this title is, off hand, one of the best PC games ever made.500 hours on steam but 2000+ hours on my 2005 CD version.A MUST OWN for any strategy or management enthusiast.10/10Edit ~11/26/16~ Nominated for the Steam ""Test Of Time"" Award			"

												I have loved Civilization since I first played ""Civilization: Call to Power"" while not a true Civ game it was still loads of fun and when I saw Complete in stores i HAD to have it, enjoyed it so much as I built up a German Empire and humbled the Russians, then i moved onto Civ IV and it did not disappoint, once again I was building an Empire and conquering my foes now in 3D.the moddability promised wasn't that great, it's so much easier to mod in Civ III, but Civ IV is still my favorite Civ game, and beats Civ V in my opinion, why? well let's just say I like the stacks, immemse armies battling each other for supremacy and the satisfying feeling that once you killed your opponents stack, you've broken his back and his cities are yours for the taking.

												Best balanced version of all the Civ games in my opinion, and Beyond the Sword specifically adds a bit of interest to the later ages compared to Warlords and Vanilla via corporations, although to be honest few games are still meaningfully in play by that point. The improved epic game speed changes are quite beneficial if you like to play at slower speeds - essential if you want to play a more war oriented game on larger maps in my opinion, so that you actually spend time using the intermediate units rather than them being obselete by the time they reach the front lines.The extra civs and leaders obviously always is a nice bonus, and they generally avoid being too similar to existing ones (within the limitations of how many there are with all the expansions enabled). The AI improvements I didn't notice too much myself from playing Warlords, but while the AI isn't great, it is competent enough in most spheres, particularly when given production bonuses at the higher difficulties, although the diplomacy aspect remains somewhat erratic, and invasions by sea tend to be a weakness.

												I don't know what it is with this game. I love the birds that come out of the trees when I enter a forest. I love the wonder movies. I love how the units speak in their language when selected. I love the empire-building aspects of it. I love this game!And yet, it doesn't feel like a video game. It feels as though I've returned to my childhood and I'm playing with my swordsmen and my knights. I can't really explain it, but through the way it's designed, this game has an effect on me that Civ 5 didn't, and where Alpha Centauri made me feel as though I was in a very adult-type situation, this game is just fun. Get it on sale, or just use $30 and get it now. It's a very fun game with one of the most creative modding communities I've ever seen. Now, I've gotta get back to my game.

												Possibly my favorite gameplay-focused game of all time. Civ4 is absolutely one of the most accessible and yet simultaneously the most complex strategy games I've ever played. And it's FUN, it's just so much darn fun. The idea of building up an empire over a large span of time isn't all that novel, but Civ4 pulls it off so well that I can't complain.Civ4 is the perfect game to play with friends, provided your friends have any sort of attention span. But it's not just that, I've lost entire days just playing Civ4 all by myself. It's so much fun to change things up, to force myself to play different ways. And it's not just the different victory types; changing anything from the map to the number of players to the settings can completely alter the way the game plays out. I've done all sorts of weird stuff, like a highest difficulty game where all forms of victory are off except time limit and my goal is just to survive until 2050.I can't recommend this game enough. It's really great.			"

												First (and only) Civ game I ever played, so I can only compare it to vanilla and warlords. It's definitely better and more in-depth than either of those with many more choices and features. I can also, of course, compare to other games in general, in which case it is well above average.The mods are pretty cool and very interesting and keep it fresh when you get bored of regular games. The one negative I can think of now is that, no matter how much I hear to the contrary, I'm still convinced the A.I. cheats! This can be very frustrating, especially when you've put dozens of hours into a game only to get destroyed, or lose in a ridiculous manner, by some civ that has some stuff/things that you're convinced they shouldn't. Either that or they make a decision that seems to make no sense, in terms of benefitting themselves, at all.Still brilliant though! and I can definitely see why they call it the 'just one more turn' effect.

												The pinnacle of the Civilization series, I first bought the Retail DVD of Civilization IV: Complete (Includes Vanilla + Warlords and BtS) in 2008 and was hooked on it. I had my eyes on this game ever since I played Civilization III on my friend's computer (and lost epicly). This game is really a cornerstone of strategy games, you will spend 100s of hours just wanting to play one more turn, and to lead your Civilization to victory. The learning curve here is steeper than it is for Civilization V, but you will get a full strategy experience that is very satisfying (even though Civ V BNW is very fun, it can't match the depth of Civ IV).

												awawawawawawawawawawwawawawawawawawawawawawa[EDIT][I just saw this review and I consider it to be lacking]400 hours of Civ IV later, I can still recommend this to you, I have not gone insane. It's a classic turn-based empire game with real charm, character and a grammy winning theme song. Voiced by Lenard Nimoy, and emblazoned with the Sid Meier's logo, this game is almost a must own for any self respecting human being.Although, some people might think that this game is slow and boring. And yes, if you play on marathon mode, or long mode or even normal mode, you can satisfy a whole week's worth of game time in just one save file.But, and this but is a Nicki Minaj scale but, turn the turn speed up to quick, set the world size to small, with random terrain generation and a full house of 16 civs, and watch your hour-or-so long chaotic power struggle ensue.Of course, if you were looking for a more epic game, the RevDCM mod pack alongside one of the larger scale earth maps, or a huge scale random map, will set you up for one of the most enjoyable empire building sim game experiences you can get.To round up, a flexible game with stunning audio, that can be tailored and played to pretty much anyone's needs. A great game and worth picking up.			"

												As suggested by the lack of negative reviews (most of them are just criticizing Valve and/or Gamespy for multiplayer issues), Civ IV is truly a masterpiece. I've been playing since its release, own physical and digital copies, logged 50+ games (most before transferring to the steam version), and still not tired of it. Although a good deal of micromanagement is necessary to really thrive, the game is fairly intuitive and has tremendous replay value. Add to this the large selection of mods and custom scenarios and it is easy to see why this game is so highly rated. Although some multiplayer functionalities have been impaired by the transition to steam, I still enjoy playing this game and will probably continue to for all eternity.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization is known for its addictive nature and now I understand why. If only I found the time to play some more...			"

												Absolutely fantastic game.  I purchased a copy when it first came out about 10 years ago, and I consistently come back to it.  I have played some of the newer Civ games - Civ V and Civ: Beyond Earth - but IV is the game to which I always return.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a well-rounded turn-based strategy game.			"

												This is still one of the best Civ experiences, possibly the best, although Civ V with all the DLC has finally just about measured up to Civ IV Beyond the Sword.I highly recommend this mod pack http://civ4bug.sourceforge.net/BUGMod.html "

												It's like crack.  You start getting into it, then when it's time to stop, you say to yourself, ""Just one more turn"".  When your friends come knocking on your door at 3am a week later, asking why you haven't been to work the last week, you tell them ""It's ok, I can quit whenever I want.""   They try to have an intervention, but you don't show up because you just discovered Uranium.Then the electric company shuts off your power cuz you haven't paid your bil in three months.  So you move in with a friend for a week.  Two months later, he's kicking you out, but it's okay because you traded your desktop for his laptop and you can play at an internet café.Then finally, you discover space travel and take your civilization to a new galaxy and you start playing the space colony mod.  Your achievement' so great you wind up in a local newspaper - because you're the first kid in your town to die in an internet café while playing a video game.  You're not even Korean.			"

												I've had the game for years as a physical copy and have enjoyed every moment of playing. I wholy recommend the mod Caveman2Cosmos, it makes the game longer and more complex.			"
