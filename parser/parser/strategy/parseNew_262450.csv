												Dead Man's Draw is a pleasant 1 vs 1 card game with fun mechanics that keep you on your toes with every card you draw. It would be awesome if they updated the game for multiplayer or at least put out a similarly priced sequel that includes it.Matches with real people would be a total blast with how fast and furious the action can get in this game. With the right draw no lead is safe.			"

												Warning! This game is incredibly luck based. If you can not take losing in a graceful way I would recommend skipping it.That said, Dead Man's Draw is a very polished card game with a decent learning curve and simple gameplay you can easily get the hang of. You can make a lot of combos with a lot of cards and you will probably have a few good hours with it.While it may seem the AI cheats, to this point I have not found it to do so. In fact, for a large part of the game the deck is stacked in your favour by giving you two traits at once while the AI has only one. The AI though is incredibly agressive, prefering to use cannons to blast your hand over potentially winning moves. This is quite annoying if you're just starting out, but often it leads to the AI impotently blasting away your 7 score card to reveal a 6 underneath, barely doing anything.The AI does not seem to be able to really understand the game, it's functional, but feels very much like it follows a flowchart rather than that it plays the game. All opponents are the same as well, all following the same AI.Luckily, where the AI does not change, the traits they use does, and the game has interesting ruleset changes after every 'tournament' (A string of a few matches) you play to keep things interesting. As much as it looks like it may be enjoyable with a friend, it does not have multiplayer at this point. To continue on with its flaws, the game needs you to play a lot to unlock things. To the point where it begins to feel like grinding, and that the randomness begins to get annoying after yet another loss to an AI using a trait that you haven't even unlocked yet.Is it polished, entertaining, and an interesting game?YesWorth 10 euro? I'd be sceptical. If you can find it on sale you're sure to get a few hours of amusement out of it, but otherwise it might be hard to get your money's worth.			"

												Well lets start by saying one thing about this game,how shall i put it ""GOD THIS GAMES ADDICTIVE"".Ok got that out of my system now on with the review,this is one of those casual games that just creeps on on you grabs you by the shoulders and says ""HEY PLAY ME I AM A REALLY GOOD GAME"" and trust me it is just that.You start the game with a normal hand of cards and when you first start you have no special traits that can be applied to your deck but you earn these as you play and earn points and level up.Now the object of the game is to win and be in front by the most points come the end of the game,now this is on some games a lot harder than it sounds depending on what special objectives are applied to that game and what special traits your opponent has equipped as these can spell success or failure depending on which ones are equipped.Some special traits make you draw 3-4 more cards,some let you take an opponents card from any set you havent got and some further still let you play a card from your hand over again and there are many more for you to discover.The graphics in game do there job (although this game is'nt about graphics to be honest) and the sound does its job also (again not really an issue as this games not about the music either) but its the play mechanics and the actual simplicity of the game that drags you in by the scruff of the neck and wont let go.Start to play and you'll see why hand follows hand and eventually you realise that you have been sat playing the game for what seems like no time at all and yet 2-3 hours have passed.Now let me say that things start of nice and easy but (and this is where the game gets you) things soon pick up and eventually you end up at one of those pull your hair out moments that a lot of these deceptive games allways seem to posses (""I NEVER GET LIKE THIS I PROMISE"" ""OH YES YOU DO YOU LIAR"" ""OH OK THEN I ADMIT I DO OK,HAPPY NOW"").Dont worry about this though and dont let it put you of because as you play the game you will eventually start to learn the little Intricacies this game has and all the little tricks it throws at you and eventually you will wade past that difficult point you were stuck on,to only then get to another point thats just as annoying and just as tricky (but allways in a good and entertaining way).So in closing if you like your games to be simple yet at times throw you with its twists in gameplay styles and also have the time to learn to play through all that the game throws at you then jump on in ""ME BOYO"",if not then i would suggest you look somewhere else as this game wont be for you,and remember why are pirates such dastardly deceptive blighters-answer ""BECAUSE THEY AAARRRRRRRRRRR"" (GOD THAT WAS SUCH AN AWFULL JOKE)			"

												A tactical card game with a mix of luck and thought. You might like it if:+ You like cardgames that have a decent amount of luck,+ You like making tactical combos with the situation at hand+ You have a weakness for pirates+ You like tactical/puzzle kind of game which provides many different challenges by having differenttakes on the rules+ Choosing 2 bonusses/modifiers is enough strategy for you.+ You like unlocking new possibilities+ You want a quick gameYou might not like it if:- You're looking for Multiplayer- you want deckbuilding- you get frustrated about luck easily- You're looking for visual spectacle.I like to play it every now and then, and it's pretty relaxing and challenging at the same time.

												I debated for a while whether I should give this a recommendation or not - and ultimately I have to say no, it doesn't deserve it.This IS a great little card game and I really like the way it plays.  Mechanically it works well once all the different card abilities have been unlocked, and I like how it eases new players in to the game.  There is some strategic decision making to be had, and there is also a 'push your luck' aspect which mixes things up nicely.  The graphics are good, but the pirate theme is pasted on.There's two things that stop me giving this a recommendation:1. There is no multiplayer.  If this game had online multiplayer for 2 players I would not hesitate to recommend it.  As it stands this omission makes the game feel a bit pricey for what it is.2. Unbalanced AI.  Far too many times the AI will manage to put together a combo that is just amazing (it's not uncommon to see a significant lead wiped out in one hand), or will draw in such a way that it doesn't make sense (for example sometimes the AI will stop drawing after 2 useless low value cards and bank them; this could be a strategic decision, but every time it happens the next card turned over would have made the AI Bust).  It all leads to too much frustration for what should be a fun time waster.			"

												This is the best card game on Steam!  (Also one of the few card games lol)  This game is easy to learn and very fun to play.  It's a game of chance and wits.  As you advance the cards have ablitities.  This isn't some RPG game.  If you like simple card games like you'd play with popular playing cards you'll love this game.  It's not poker and you don't have to twist your brain to learn this.  You can learn the game in just minutes and it starts with a tutorial.  The visuals are great too.  The cards look great and the environment has a nice pirate feel to it.  So far this game is only single player.  Hopefully they'll update it with online multiplayer.  If you're still unsure if you want it, download it on an iOS device.  It's free in the App Store.  $10 sounds like a lot for this game but I gave this game a shot and a few hours later I was still playing!  It's addictive :)			"

												This is a fun card game that you can just sit down and play and relax while your doing it. Easy to learn, but that's not to say there aren't things to think about while playing. More strategy in playing your cards are added at the different challenges. And there are a lot of challenges to go through so there is always a reason to keep coming back to the game. The game is more based on luck of the draw than strategy but it's not all luck. You can also unlock abilities by completing challenges that you can use to make certain cards more powerful for your own style of play that you prefer. Up to two can be used after you unlock both ability slots.  Overall I recommend the game if you enjoy card games for sure.			"

												Dead Man's Draw is hard to explain. It's a card game with pirates, and it's a very casual one. Anyone can play it and anyone will understand it, unlike Magic The Gathering. Just believe me when I say that it's a very fun game and one that I'm still enjoying.You'll be playing tournaments against other pirates, which start off rather easy, but increase in difficulty after just a few of them. And that's not because the game is becoming harder - it plays out the same way in every tournament you participate in - but the rules do change. Where initially your goal is to get the higest score, there'll be tournaments where you have to get a score of 60 or lower or certain drawn cards will be added to your opponent's score. This keeps things fresh and challenging.You get XP for every opponent you beat and every tournament you complete. Leveling up allows you to unlock perks and portraits. Perks can be used to make your life a little easier. For example, there's a card that allows you to see the next card on the stack and 'activating' a certain perk might allow you to see 2 more after that. There are many more to be unlocked, but it will require quite a few battles. The limit seems to be level 34, by the way.I'm not sure how many tournaments there are just yet, but there seems to be tens of them. I think I'm about 10-15% finished now so completing the entire game might take you more than 20 hours if I had to take a guess.Plenty of content here as you can see. Unfortunately there's not much else to do but to battle opponents and level up. I have the feeling that it's missing something, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe I was hoping to see you get money for tournaments that could then be used to unlock things like portraits (instead of leveling up). It's not even worth mentioning if I look back now, but maybe I'm not the only one.Dead Man's Draw is a fantastic little addictive game and truly is a game for everyone. Highly recommended ![Rating: 86/100]			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Stardock Entertainment Publishers: Stardock Entertainment Initial release: Feb 2014Genre: Casual, Strategy #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationARRGH to the winner be the spoils, the loser, TA DAVY JONES LOCKER WITH YAR!Dead Man's Draw is a deceptively simple game based on both skill and luck together.  In all honesty its about 40% luck 60% skill.The core game is based on 1v1 drawing from the same deck, once the deck is gone the player with the most points win. How do I earn points you ask? Well, let me tell you. There are 10 suits which have numbers on them 7 to 2. Each card in your hand adds to your point value. However only the highest card in each suit counts. Each suit has a specific ability once drawn which are slowly introduced and pretty easy to quickly grasp. But a few examples are the canon suit makes your opponent discard a card or the mystic suit allows you to see what card is next in the deck. You can pull as many cards from the deck as you want each turn unless you pull 2 of the same suit, then you bust and all the cards drawn are discarded. However further into the game there are modifiers that may change this function. There is no multi-player which is a little sad but its still very enjoyable against the AI. The game is also slightly RPGish in that you earn experience points even if you lose, though not as many. It'd be cool if it had some tech trees or something to tailor your own progression but you earn XP fast enough where that doesn't really matter. The games aren't very long either, probably 5-7 minutes if I had to guess. The XP earns you levels which at each level unlocks either a new character portrait or a character trait which is essentially an additional modifier to the core rules. Using the example from before, the mystic trait would change when the mystic card is active, it would reveal the next 3 cards in the deck rather than just 1. The other traits are similar in this fashion. Once multiple traits are unlocked you can choose from them before each match to attempt to thwart any rule changes that may make you play more defensively or cautious rather than an all out attack or risking a bust. The game is split into tournaments, each having their own modifiers on the core game as well as each opponent within having modifiers of their own. Which leads to what is a very simple game into something that keeps you on your toes and keeps you switching tactics to progress. THE GISTVery fun, enjoyable casual filler game that is easy to grasp but hard to master with a side of luck thrown in. May the best pirate win.Follow my curation for more "

												I really enjoyed this game, the rules are really simple to pick up, it's fun to play, the characters are memorable and consistent in 'who they are' with the trait combos they use. The AI is really good and not overly cheaty, there were a couple of times I thought you wouldn't keep drawing like that or you'd have had to have known that card was there to have carried on or to have played that card, but this didn't happen often enough to make it a concern. It is incredibly fair the majority of the time.Basically cards in your hand are banked, cards in the draw pile are the ones that you play with.There are 10 suits and each suit has a function.You're trying to beat the characters and usually you need a score of 65 at least on each game to get 3 stars on a tournament. (It will unlock the other tournaments on just one star though which just requires you to win each game with any score. I was going for the achievement which is why the 65 was important to me.)You play cards from the draw pile, if you get a duplicate suit you lose all the cards in play to the bust pile (unless your opponent has a trait that puts bust cards into their hand instead)Only the highest card from each suit is counted towards your score (although there are a couple of tournaments that count every card towards your score)* Anchors lock all previously played cards so you can't lose them* Hooks let you play a card from your hand* Clairvoyant lets you see what's next in the deck. (The mystic trait will allow you to view the next 3)* Swords lets you play a card from your opponent's hand as long as you don't already have the suit in your hand or currently           in play.* Chest combines with a key card to give you a selection of cards from the bust pile based on how many cards you drew that turn (or your ops hand if you have the plunderer trait. The treasure hunter trait will let you triple the amount of cards you get given)* Cannon makes you discard a card from your hand which goes to the bust pile, or you can take the misfire trait and you can discard a card from your ops hand instead....if you combine misfire with the scavenger trait, the card you blasted goes in to your hand.* Kraken makes you draw 2 cards to play so you can't choose to bank the cards you have until you've drawn them. If your op has the beastmaster trait you'll have to draw 4 cards.* Mermaid lets you replay a card currently in play....Sir Lovesword sometimes uses a trait that banks the card you replay (you can also unlock this trait)* Maps lets you take a card from the bust pile and put it in play. Ordinarily you get to choose between 3 cards, but the navigtator trait lets you pick from any card in the pile.You don't have to memorise the suits to play effectively, if you hover over a card it will say at the top of the screen what the suit does. There are loads of traits to choose from which you unlock as you level up (much more than the ones I've mentioned here) which allow you to manipulate how the suits work for you or against your op.You can choose 2 traits at a time to use.I completed the game with 3 stars on every tournament and I tended to stick with the misfire and scavenger traits. I only occasionally swapped one or both of these out for something else.Here's a tip if you're going for the 3 star achievements....you can only get 70 points in total (unless you're in the tournaments that count every card towards your score) and you normally need 65 points per game, so I played to get five 7's and the rest as sixes if I couldn't get 7's (obviously any extra 7's will allow you to have another suit at lower than 6 and still get the 65 points you need), all lower numbers are dross and can be gambled with. The cannons trait combo will let you steal the 7's you need from your opponents hand. There are a few times this trait combo doesn't work as well, or you'll find it's better to negate your opponents traits instead but for the most part this method worked brilliantly.There is no multiplayer, which doesn't bother me, I prefer single player games for the most part, this game would be great as   a multiplayer though.I bought Dead Man's Draw when it was on sale for around £1.64 but I think it's worth the £6.99 they normally ask for.Brilliant game, very easy to learn, simple to play yet there's loads to it :)			"

												This game is incredibly addictive. its a card game sure and therefore a casual gamers game but this game is really quite complex and tactical. Don't be put off by the piratey theme of this game, I'm not such a fan either. there are lots of rules but each rule is introduced to you one by one so its easy to pick up. I have alot of games to play at the moment but I find myself putting more hours into this than anything else. despite its complexity I cannot fault this game. its not always easy but it is well balanced and extremely well thought out. I do however wonder why there isn't an option for local or online multiplayer because this would be a great game to play against other people but I guess the the point of this game might be to promote the fact that this game exists as an actual card game. if this is the case then they have suceeded because I assuming I can find a copy I will buy a deck.

												So, although not nearly as cool as the name and pictures would suggest, this game is still good, addictive fun. The actual card game consists of equal parts strategy and luck. However, the better you are at the strategic element of the game, the less luck factors in. Especially if you choose your buffs well (once you have unlocked one and/or both slots available). You unlock different buffs as you rise in level and/or defeat certain ""levels"". Each level (or whatever) comprises of up to three battles (so far anyway, around 40 or so battles in (maybe 50), or hands if you will. Different ""enemies"" use different buffs as well, which can lead to some challenging battles. Overall, it's a fun game that you can play in small 15 minute chunks if you want, or play for hours at a time. This game is well suited to work around your schedule.Anyway, I defintely recommend at the recent sale price, but the full price is still a reasonable asking price.7 out of 10.			"

												What an outstanding game. Dead Man's Draw is a strategic card game that fully immerses the player in new and exciting ways as they progress through the game. It doesn't take very long at all to  become very familiar with the game mechanics and how the game is played, but it does take quite some time to truly master any number of dazzling card combinations to become the victor. As you progress, you gain experience and level up, unlocking any number of ""traits"" that make your card playing abilities even more powerful.  For the price, this game is definitely worth its money. Its easy playability make it a perfect game for taking a break from other games, and its a great standalone game as well. If this game were actually played with real cards, I could see it being a family favorite really fast.I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a well rounded, challenging card game, pc game, or strategy game.

Both the app and board game have their pros and cons, but the game design is solid, the artwork is great, and most importantly, they're both really fun to play. Highly recommended as a fun diversion. The PC app is particularly fun because of all of the things you unlock and variants that you end up playing to help keep the game play fresh. I just wish it had a multiplayer option and continued to be developed by Stardock.			"

												Do you like card games?  If so, then this relatively unknown gem is one that you need to add to your collection.  The game was so well-received that Mayday games (in conjunction with Stardock) made a physical version of the game that can be purchased at Amazon and other retailers.Dead Man's Draw is a pirate-themed  card game with an interesting rule-set that changes each game.  Each of the 10 suits has it's own unique 'ability'.  Additionally, players can choose up to two 'triats' each hand that invariably change the gameplay and adds to replay value.There are some things that the game could have done better.  The lack of multi-player is the biggest thing missing from the game.  Another thing that would have made the game even better would be a 'free-play' mode; the game is very structured -- which is great for learning the game -- but that 'structure' means that the game will decide who you play, in what order you play them, and any special rules for that particular game/hand.Dead Man's Draw is an entertaining card game that can be played for 5 minutes at a time or 5 hours at a time.  If you like cards and you see this on sale ... get it.			"

												If you like card games, definitely give this a shot.It has a unique deck, and each suit has unique properties.  Unlocking traits lets you extend the abilities of each suit.  The play is in tournament style, with each tournament having its own rules to make this an interesting game.  The nine different opponents you face also have their own play styles.The game is simple to learn, but your traits and the opponent traits, plus the tourney rules make the gameplay varied and not boring.EDIT: You don't get to simply pick your two favorite traits and stick with them for every game - the traits chosen by your opponent can nullify a trait you choose.

												Game is extremely fun, but warning about some really lousy progamming decisions by the developer.Basically, if you are the only one playing this game on a single computer you are fine. But if you EVER play the game on the same computer that someone else has played under even a different Steam account, you end up permanently sharing the same game. There is only one in-game profile, which can not be dleted easily [Seriously?], the game shares a common save file with all other players on a computer [who does that? i.e. not account based], and if it ever cloud synchs it overwrites them all.So if you have a seperate computer for each player and never play it on another computer, good to go.That all being said the game is so cool that my partner and I made a physical card deck verision of the game so we coudl play two player while we wait for the multiplayer option.

												After hours and hours of playing this card game I need to say it's really well made. While I'm not a huge fan of pirate theme, it's still something I really enjoy playing and I don't think I'll ever get bored of it. For first I'll point out pros of this, because I need to point out few of them:A) Combination of really easy to learn mechanics combined with amount of strategies you may pull off with cards you have on your hand + traits. Traits is what make this so fun to play and yet allow you to be creative with your plays. Technically after tutorial you learn everything you need, while with each in-game tournament you learn new card combos and gain traits to use.B) The amount of gameplay which in-game tournaments provide you. Counting all cards when it goes to points ? No problem. You need to reach 50 points first ? Also in. You can't score more than 60 points while beating opponent in points ? In as well. The amount of possible modes to play in is just nice making each tournament pretty much different. C) Graphics and music are good combination here. For a simple game like this, I would say it fits really well.D) Still lots of room for improvements and new additions. The amount of cards is good, but not huge enough IMO to add few cards in-game without making it too complicated. There's also a possibility of new traits. In other words - this game has still more potential for improvement.E) Good AI which actually can not only count well (which is not as obvious in such games) but counter your strategies and eliminate/steal cards which are the main core of your strategy. I'm really happy with this as it makes game challenging.Although unfortunately I see few problems as well:A) Lack of multiplayer is outright unacceptable. I would really love to play this game against real players and outright test some traits and card combos against them, especially when this game has the perfect combination of simple mechanics and yet good amount of strategies and combos available to use. Please, do it. It's such a waste otherwise.B) Price is a bit too high for a card game like this, but I must admit I don't regret spending this money. But still, I would lower the price. Or I won't even bother mentioning this as a con as long as creators will add multiplayer option. C) While it is luck based (and I don't mind this, it adds additional thrill for example when one lucky pull saves you), but I think game favors AI a bit more than a player. But maybe that's me and I'm a bit biased. But still, you should still win more games than loose if you choose your cards and traits right.In other words I give this game 8/10 because of small cons and lack of multiplayer. I really recommend this game as it's fun, addicting and challenging, while you don't need to waste time learning complicated mechanics. I would give 9.5/10 with multiplayer, but without it - I can't. Still good buy and certainly not wasted money as long as you enjoy card games ;).			"

												This is very close. Another game I wish I could give a neutral rating. Its a push your luck card drawing game with each suit triggering a different mechanism and along with your traits you can combine them in to more or less devestating attacks in order to collect cards that bolster your score.Contrary to some of the reviews Ive seen nothing to suggest that the AI is cheating, it does pull off some last minute nasty moves at times but keeping my cool I can think back to the many times I have done the same thing. How much this actually matters is debateable, if the game makes you feel like it is cheating then whether it is or it isnt, the frustration is always real. I think this will be the biggest sticking point for most people, at first it may not be quite so apparent but as things go on you will see through to the luck component of the game increasingly easily and more and more you will feel robbed by complete chance regardless of how well youve played a hand.The traits and the combination of traits can be fun to toy around with, but this leads to a scoring issue. The game considers high scores to be good, not a difference in score between you and your opponent. This means that the many aggressive tactics put you at a horrible disadvantage; even when winning regularly with your strategy if you have not defended your high score you will end up winning tournaments tens of points away from the three stars you are aiming for. Its kind of a punishment just for picking a style of play. You can unlock more and more traits as the game goes on, but also portraits which are quite dull. Id have preferred them just to stick to a lower level and give the portraits for free along side the traits. Each tournament has a set of rules, and some of them really shake up the game format, unfortunately they repeat the rule sets two or three times due to the huge number of tournaments there are. Again, I would have preferred fewer more focused tournaments, as the gameplay simply isnt varied enough to support the huge number of what are essentially the same games over and over. (60 tournaments in all, with about 3 games on average in each.) The tournament scores are also very harsh, some require you to be within 5 points of maximum score in each of 3 or 4 games, it can lead to _a lot_ of repetition. (Cards go from 2 to 7 so a single lost card is more than enough to bring about a failure.)and of course. A big issue for many, no multiplayer. I can understand this to a degree, they have a boardgame to sell as well, and this is about a third of the price of it, but the different use cases really should take care of this. A lot of people buy boardgames even when they have a digital version on an iPad or some such to hand. In fact there are plenty of people who play computer games who dont board game and vice versa. It seems that for every good thing in this game there is something that brings it back down or ends up making it tedious or frustrating. By and large, Im going to recommend it, its not that expensive and its fun enough. _Just_ fun enough though, not nearly as enjoyable as I think it could have been.			"

												Starts off very simple as the game teaches you the basic mechanics, but gets progressively more challenging as different card traits are unlocked. There's a lot more depth to the strategy than I expected initially. There's a lot of risk involved in deciding how many cards to draw each turn, so it's not a good choice for people who don't like the randomness of card games, but for those who enjoy assessing the odds, it's an enjoyable challenge. Easy to learn, great for casual play. Pity there's no hotseat or multi-player modes.Update: Why can't I stop playing this game? It keeps getting better and better as more traits and interesting challenges are unlocked. And the challenges seem to go on and on and on... when is this game going to end? Lots and lots of content in this game. Simple yet continually challenging. Highly recommended. The AI is usually pretty good too.			"

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/dead-mans-draw-game-review/Dead Man's Draw is a fantastic card game. Although a lot of it may be luck-based, the AI never appears to have an advantage and, for the most part, the AI plays fair.The game is really easy to learn. I picked it up in the very first match I played, probably because the concept is simple: Draw cards to fill up the various suites in your hand, but draw too many, and risk losing the currently drawn cards. For example, if I draw three cards from the deck: a sword, an anchor, and a cannon, and then draw another card of the same type (like another cannon), then I lose those three cards and cannot add them to my hand. The goal is to have the highest number of each suite in your hand, combining to form the highest overall score.Each card ranges from values 2-7. Whatever value is the highest that you currently have in hand will be the one added to your score. You can have others of the same suite, but they wont be counted towards your total score. The optimal hand would consist of a 7 from each suite: anchor, hook, crystal ball (?), cutlass, treasure chest, key, cannon, barnacle, mermaid, and scroll. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins.The gameplay seems simple, yes, but it gets progressively gets increasingly complex the more you play it. Eventually, each suite will have its own ability. The cannon, for example, when drawn from the deck, allows you to discard one of your opponent's cards. If you're smart, you'll usually go for whichever card has the highest value in its suite. Later on, an ability is also added to the cutlass, allowing you to, upon draw, steal the top suite from your opponent for a suite that you currently do not have. Each card will eventually have their own abilities, all of which are very fun to use.Once you've unlocked all of the card's abilities, you'll get into character traits, which allow you, and you specifically, to make use of a special trait. The first one you'll unlock makes it so the cannon removes an entire suite of cards, instead of the highest number of that suite, from your opponent. This prevents them from having a backup to replace that suite once the higher number is removed.The AI in the game also puts up a fair fight. They don't seem ""too"" lucky, but they do know their math, and will make a lot of good decisions. Regardless, I still found the game surprisingly easy, even in the later levels. I only ever lost a couple of times, and those few losses were very close matches too.Overall, Dead Man's Draw is a must-buy. It is incredibly fun. Although it may appear boring, or simple, it can certainly provide a one-of-a-kind experience.			"

												Wish i could give a neutral review as this game does not really deserve positive review necessarily but thumbs down is too harsh. especially as the price is right and the game delivers basically what is promises. Basically. Game mechanics has two things that deserve attention: too much RNG based gameplay which in turn slowly but surely sours the gameplay once you put in more than a few hours. Every game is a RNG luck fest of defeating your opponent with trait Y who in turn uses X while rules Z are in effect..  Not bad - for awhile.... but the random feeling win-loose chains really dont make much sense after some time. You can't look back and say 'i should have done that hand differently.  You can - and must - put in some tactics to how you play but this far no specific strategies are winning strategies because of RNG. Buyer beware.  "

												The card game itself is original and interesting. It's fun to play and discover at first.However, it does get repetitive after a while, because it's incredibly luck based. You can tell yourself you're using sneaky tactics, but at the end of the day, you're given a random card, and there is one optimal way to use it, so thinking of new strategies is useless. Also, you play versus all kinds of different characters, but they all make the same moves, and use the cards the same way.Regardless of that, I think it would be a decent game if it had a multiplayer option. I mean - that's why you usually play card games. It'd be fun to play with friends, see who gets lucky and who doesn't. But with no multiplayer, it's unfortunately a game that gets old very fast.			"

												A time killer, just realize there is NOTHING random about the cards. At one point you will play numbers instead of suits. You will notice that you are pulling 3 card doubles about 80% of the time. Let's see, 2 cards drawing a third, 7 numbers total. That's 2 cards of 7 that will cause a double and 5 cards that won't. Does it seem like you are playing those odds. Now add the 2 card doubles. This game also has tension builders that are not needed. You have to rush your discard pick because it moves right away. The computer's is figured before the graphics even shows but the screen pauses and slowly scolls like it is choosing at a relaxed pace. Creating what seems to be an unfair illusion because the computer does not need that relaxed pace. Now the ""Busted"" graphic does get old but it is also creating tension. First, you are being told repeatedly that you have failed. Next, clicking the mouse should remove it and the cards, starting the next hand. It doesn't work, you have to press the mouse a second time to remove the cards. Thus you try to match the timing of the double click or wait for ""busted"" to disappear on it's own. As that tension builds you are now button mashing thinking that will speed it up. One click should finish the process but they want that tension there. It helps the AI appear to be a tougher opponent. Actually the AI follows a pretty basic set of commands. In the end the Devs ruined the game by adding these things so I cannot recommend it.			"

												This card game is similar to 21 (Black Jack), in that players draw cards (10 suits, 6 per suit) increasing their score until they stay and collect, or bust by drawing 2 of the same suit.This is an unusual video game, because a player experiences 3 different phases that are completely different.Phase 1. Honeymoon: You love it. You are winning most games. You get half the achievements in 2 hours of play.Phase 2. Frustration: Now the games are evenly matched you each have 2 traits. Your opponent is better than you. They have a computer program that instantly calculates odds on inceasing the score risk. Now the rules change often and your AI opponet never forgets them. The AI has all the best card play sequences for every situation stored in its memory, you don't. You are still winning games, but you are losing 4 times as many.Phase 3. Resolution: Out of your frustration to proceed you look for a guide and read the forums. You learn about a bug that gives you an unfair advantage. It is merely an undocumented key board stroke. No 3rd party. You use it to slaughter your opponents now scoring huge wins. You feel elated and take revenge on the opponents that hve been consistently beating you. You feel justified because you have convinced yourself that the deck is stacked in the AI's favor (even though it is not).Few other games have brought out more emotions in me as I played it. Both thrill and agony.Get it on sale for $2.49Don't get it if you are a purist strategist, this game has too much random luck for you.			"

												I appreciate how hard it is to create a card game with new rules. Well, there are books around here with rules for hundreds of Solitaire game and 2-player games made with regular cards, so you can always get inspiration from those, I guess. This one game uses a custom deck with many more suits, each being associated with a power-up.The hardest part is balancing it out, I guess. DMD doesn't do it with flying colors, though. You can only unlock tournaments one at a time. If you really suck at a particular set of rules, you're screwed, you just can't finish the game. I'm only halfway through it and with about 12 hours of playtime, I'm guessing there's at least 25 to 30 hours of time to play. It's all very artificial, though... After a while, new tournaments are just variations on the previous ones, with harder AI, etc.My biggest issue with the game is the complete lack of a story. There are characters; tournaments all have a title that supposedly draws from pirate lore. Great. But no one has anything to say, you just play against them and I guess you have to make up your own story.The soundtrack is very limited, too. There's a quasi rip-off of the Pirates of the Caribbean score used in the main menu (at least it's longer than the very similarly PotC-themed single track from Clicker Heroes), and a more ambient song used during games. Overall, it looks like most of the development time was spent on refining the game rules. To each their own.I'll also note that some of the special rules are self-contradictory, and as such the AI appears to be cheating, when it's just not applying the rules properly. I don't know what to say about that. This game is getting old, I doubt it'll ever be fixed.If you're into hard casual games, walk the plank and give this one a try. It's well worth its price on sale. Maybe even at full price. I don't know, I'm not used to buying games full price any more... I'm so scared they'll get bundled the following week for a buck. Yes, it has happened before, and it will happen again™.EDIT: I finished the game after 25 hours. In line with the last of story, there is absolutely no ending. No even a congratulations message for finishing all 60 (?) tournaments. Gosh, I wish it weren't so addictive... At least, now I can move on. Game isn't too hard because it relies so much on luck, and getting XP on losses means you'll eventually unlock everything, including unbeatable combos like Misfire/Parry or Plunderer/Davy Jones' Locker, etc. The fun comes in trying to find the right combo for each duel. Unfortunately, after the first half, all of your adversaries start using the same usual combos, so there's nothing new to see beyond the first dozen of hours. Still, well worth its price.			"

												Addictive little card game, like Uno in that every card has an ""action"" that occurs when you play it (steal cards, be forced to draw two more cards, allow you to ""protect"" your existing cards, etc) , but you draw cards until you either decide to bank them, or you draw two of the same suit (in which case you lose all the currently drawn cards).  The idea is to get the most points, and the highest-scoring card of each suit from your hand is all that counts.Nice, steady introduction so you don't get confused, calm progression so you don't notice that you're learning the full game, and occasionally a spin-ball thrown into the rules to keep you thinking.Ignore the comments people make about it ""cheating"" - as far as I can tell, it's the usual gambling fallacies where you remember bad luck that happened to you, but not your good streaks.  It's as random as any other card game, but unlike a lot of others this would actually make quite a fun two-player card game with a real deck.Would be nice to see a multiplayer mode (even if only two-player).

												I don't typically do a lot of reviews, but I had to write about this little gem.  It won't blow you out of the water with anything amazingly awesome, it's just a really well made and balanced card game that they can (and do!) throw a lot of twists and kinks in to make it enjoyable for numerous hours.  You also get access to more abilities and cards as you progress through the game.  I would normally never want to play a card game (especially a card game!) in a single player mode without any multiplayer options, but there's an exception to every ""rule"".  This one is that exception.I really loved the hell out of this game and after seeing it in my library I had to write a review, re-install, and am now currently very looking forward to playing this game from start to finish a second time!  To top it all off, it is on sale quite often, even at 75% off where you can snag this pirate's bounty for a mere $1.74!  And hell, it is even worth the original $6.99 price tag.

												Dead Man's Draw is a pirate themed card game that you play against an AI opponent.  There are 10 different card types in this card game, each card type has it's own unique abilities.  The game further allows you to equip two traits before each match in order to form a strategy going in that could best counter your opponent.Even though I gave this game a No recommendation, it doesn't mean that this game is bad.  It's can actually be quite fun at times.  The problem comes in when you put in more than 5 or 6 hours in the game.  The first bunch of matches were really fun, you were unlocking new card powers and then new traits to augment those card powers.  Each game felt really unique and it was fun to learn how each new power interacted with the ones you unlocked before it.  However the tedium started to set in after about 6 or so hours of play into the game.  Unlocks became very slow and instead of cool new traits now you were getting cosmetic hero potraits which further slowed getting new traits.  The game does try to combat some of that tedium by introducing a different set of table/map rules for the matches as you further progress into the game.  And yes the first time you play those rules it again brings you back into the game.  Instead of just having more banked points/gold than your opponent you have to beat him and have less than a certain number of points/gold, or instead of just counting the highest point value cards in your hand it counts total value of all cards currently held (which can get kind of crazy with some of the traits that you or the AI can have).  But once again the tedium sets in.  Once you've played through the rule sets twice, it's no longer that fun and combined the fact that you've progressed so far in the game and nothing else has really changed each match feels more like the ones before it and there doesn't feel like a really big need to keep playingAnd then there is some randomness that needs mentioing.  The randomness is mostly contained to only the drawing of cards.  After the draw is done based on how the cards interact with each other and the traits you can equip you can control the randomness of the drawing a fair bit by comboing cards together.  However that still wont' stop you from drawing a key and drawing a second key and busting your turn without being able to do anything.Lastly since this is against the AI only, I'll mention that the AI isn't exactly the most polished.  They do make some questionable moves at times while at other times pull off perfect combos and that inconsistancy can add some not needed frustration on top of game that kind of feels like it's to long.I'll finish up with saying that I'm not giving this game the thumbs down because it's bad.  It's not a bad game, it's actually quite well done and the card mechanics are quite fun.  It's just that I can't recommend it to everyone, it's a very niche game and for someone looking maybe to kill 10-20 minutes here and there it can be fun but playing for longer times in one sitting shows the weaknesses the game has.

												Far, far too luck-based for my taste. I'm not opposed to certain types of randomness in games (especially card games) as far as the initial dealing of the cards, but once you play your cards, they should be played. Dead Man's Draw doesn't feel that way, though.It's essentially just regular old ""War"" where you and your opponent draw cards and whoever draws the highest card wins, but DMD just puts off the score tally until the end and has you ""test your luck"" each around by drawing additional cards and trying not to bust. Essentially, it is a combination of blackjack and war.What I don't like about it, though, is that the game is overflowing with random occurrences of upsets and reversals. Imagine blackjack or war where every number between 1 and 10 has a special effect, where if you draw that number, a certain thing will happen every time you draw that number, no matter what. This goes for both you and your opponent. Drawing a 1 reveals the next card to be dealt (note: it doesn't give you the OPTION to look at it; it just shows you). Drawing a 2 forces you to remove a high-scoring card from your opponent's discard pile, dropping their points. Drawing a 2 and a 3 on the same turn automatically doubles your score for this round. Drawing a 5 forces you to steal any card from your opponent's discard pile. As these effects are turned on, they can be chained together into combos by you or your opponent. Draw a 5 and steal a 1 from your opponent (lowering their score), which allows you to see that the next card is a 2 and won't bust you, which you draw (raising your score) and use to destroy another one of your  opponent's cards (lowering their score). When you are chaining these combos, it feels like ""strategy"", but the only reason you got to perform this combo was luck (you happened to draw a 5), and deciding which card you are going to steal or destroy is a bit of a no-brainer. So it is a very shallow sort of strategy as far as I can tell.The net result of every drawn card having some kind of game-upsetting effect is that even when you score points, you can't count on the fact that you simply scored those points. Your opponent will randomly draw a huge combo opportunity on the next turn and drop your points from 50 to 10 while raising his points from 7 to 48. The score upheavals and reversals can be so random and large, it's enough to give you whiplash.Ultimately what this game feels like is if the game gave you and your opponent each a bag full of random effects, and each turn you both randomly draw an effect out of the bag, which makes some random stuff happen, and then one of you ends up having more points than the other. Whoever that turns out to be is the winner. End game.Also, the game has the most superficial and meaningless use of XP I have ever seen. I don't know why it is in there. For a feature brag, I assume.The art is great, though. The game looks and sounds fantastic. The test-your-luck blackjack element is a great aspect of the game and probably my favorite thing about it (and the gameplay element that persuaded me to give the game a try). Unfortunately, the torrent of forced upheaval effects on the cards just turns the whole thing sour for me. It feels like a game of interesting decisions getting overruled by a steady torrent of RNG interruptions, which just turns me off.			"

												Ignore my 6.5 hours on record, as my wife and I played this game nearly every day while aboard a ship crossing the Indian Ocean. Ahoy matey, is right! Unlocked all but the ""Legendary"" Achievement.Anyway, I recommend this game as a fun diversion for those times when you want to play something without having to think too hard. The 50 tournaments will give you plenty of gameplay for your doubloons, but it does start to feel repetitive after a while. If you spend any time trying to 3-star a tournament, you're likely to unlock the last of the Traits and Avatars well before reaching the final tournament which ultimately makes reaching the bottom of the tournament tree a bit anti-climactic. This is starting to sound kind of negative. It shouldn't. We enjoyed the game for a long while, until it started to bore us with its same-sameyness. Then again, what 2-player card game doesn't get old after a while?			"

The tournament conditions adds a very nice variation to the game, which gives a nice boost to the replay value. If your a fan of RNG based (card)games then Dead Man's Draw is surely a game to pick up.			"

												Gamers have been around pirates for a long time now, and my experiences trace all the way back to the Monkey Island Series. Dead Man's Draw is now the game that I imagine grogged up pirates in other games have been playing all along. Something about the rules seems familiar but I could not off the top of my head think of what game it could be inspired of. Its easy to pick up and understand and it has a good blending of skill and luck. I really like the high seas theme for the suits of cards and the game has an appropriate sound and casual pirate music background to accompany its pleasant tavern-ish décors and caricaturesque pirates. This is a very nice time waster to enjoy in company of people who otherwise dont enjoy video games. This game is a mobile port as far as I read from other reviews and does not accomodate Pass and Play Modes or any Online Mode. Lack of Pass N Play is a huge disappointment to me.I recommend this game!			"

												One of the best casual card games I've played -- and I've played a lot of them! The deck consists of 10 suits of cards numbered 2 through 7, and your simple goal is to get the highest single card of each suit you can, with lower-ranked cards you collect functioning as backup for when (not if) your top card gets stolen.Each suit has a special ability tied ingeniously to its thematic element.  For example, swords allow you to steal and play a card from your opponent's hand, while anchors ""lock down"" all previous card in the current play to protect them from a bust. (A bust occurs if you draw a second card of an already-played suit in the same turn.)The artword could not be better, and there are tons of special abilities (""traits"") to unlock.  Achievements are gained by playing a series of tournaments using special rulesets (e.g., ""Swords and cannons target the lowest card of a suit instead of the highest"").  Even though it's a completely casual game, I find myself enjoying it for hours at a time.  If you like card games, you MUST get this one.			"

												This is possibly the worst game I've played yet. The ""luck"" of the AI is slanted so extremely in its favor, its impossible to win a match. Every time I draw the octopus card, which forces you to draw 2 more cards, 80% of the time I immediately draw another octopus, which busts my hand. You can't have more than one of a card type out. If I draw the fortune teller to see what the next card in the deck is, 75% of the time it's another fortune teller card, which I can't draw, because I'll bust. This also means I leave that card for the AI. I've been able to play 5 cards maybe twice without busting. I've seen the AI go up to 7, clean out my entire hand with cannons and swords, and not bust. The AI draws a cannon and/or a sword 90% of the time, more often than not it draws both. Sometimes it even draws a mermaid so it can reuse one of those. The AI draws the chest + key fairly regularly. I usually only get it if I pull the chest or key out with the map or hook cards. This is hands down the most frustrating game I've ever played, especially a casual card game.			"

												Ahhh... One another lazy coding about game mechanics and AI. When you climb up the Tournement Tree, the only thing you see is ""How lucky (!) AI is when drawing cards"" and how you lose following one hand after another. Developers even did not bother themselves making a small numbers of music or effect archive. Ohhh, moreover they did not even bother to make some more ingame AI opponents as well. Sometimes you play against the same AI character 3 times in succession.The only positive side is the Card Game rules. IT's a lot fun.... more than many of card game types. Also the graphics are somehow well done.If you would like to have some different type of card game which will be fun for about 1 to 5 days, then buy it, but only when it is on sale.			"

												Once you've played for an hour, the deciding factor of any match is luck rather than skill.  Combine with an a computer opponent that may or may not be cheating, and you have a very frustrating game.  It's all well put together outside of that, but I just can't waste any more time on this.

TL;DR Very simplistic card game requiring almost no skillThis is a very basic card game where the objective is to form a better hand than the computer opponent.  You form hands by taking turns drawing from a deck, each turn ending when you/AI collect the cards drawn, or bust by uncovering two cards of the same suit.  When the deck is depleted, the round is over and the winner is the player who has the better hand.There you have it.  If that sounds interesting, go ahead, but that's all you'll be getting.Sure, there are special card abilities and other razz-a-matazz to make the game seem more interesting but those don't change the fact that it's basically a simplistic luck-based game with a little bit of decision-making thrown in to make it seem like your skill factors into it.Good graphics, good presentation, good user interface and reasonably smart AI, yet stupid enough to make conspicuously bone-headed decisions, which breaks immersion.Maybe I've played too many card games in my life, or maybe I've programmed too many, but this game doesn't offer me what I want which is a skill-based card game with a little luck thrown in.  Instead this is a luck-based game with a little skill required.			"

												This is a fun puzzle game. You can play it for an hour or two unutil you get bored. Casual.However, the game has an extremely annoying mechanic. The opponent player prioritizes removing your card over everything else. For example, let's say he can play a key card and there is already a lock card on the table. So playing that key will get him loads of cards from the deck. But instead he's going to play a cannon to remove 2 points from your deck instead of gaining 15 points himself.And this trait makes it a very very annoying game as you see over and over again in each level the same underhanded tactics being used by the opponent.Another annoying thing is that the opponents can use advanced-level abilities and you can't. And it makes the game quite unfair. I wanted an easier casual game where I don't have to repeat the same level over and over again.But if you can overlook both these points then everything else in the game is positive. The graphics, the puzzles, the simplicity, the variety of powers.I still can't recommend this game because I had to keep playing thanks to my OCD else I would have quit a long time back.			"

												Initially, this was a thumbs up review...In the beginning, I was very impressed with this game. It's a bit complicated to understand the mechanics, but once you got an idea of how everything works together and what combos are possible, it starts to get really entertaining. BUT: DMD gets frustrating in late game. Reason? The AI is balanced in early ~, but I'd prefer it if they failed drawing as much cards as I do. No matter what I do, AI always gets the needed card to win on the river. Made me uninstall it, because it really makes no sense to play when anything I do is getting countered on the last card. Tried for like 100 times. 100 times last card win. Call it bad luck? Maybe. I call dips on bad balancing.			"

												Pros :+ interesting concept for a card game+ simple to learn+ moderately challenging AI+ fast-paced match,can choose for faster animation for faster gameCons :-Sometimes can be very frustrating due to the nature of the game being luck-based. However this can be somewhat mitigated by choosing a correct skill for each corresponding enemy-(very rarely)freeze and crash to the desktop unexplicably. Had this happened twice so far so it's not that bad.-can make you feel repetitive after a whileConclusion :A very good game that is easy and quick to pick up,learn and pass the time with. Good for the price. You might want to pick this up if you're looking for a mini-game that's on par with bejeweled and the likes.			"

												I haven't played that much of it yet, but so far it's a great little card game. Interesting game rules, fast games that don't take forever (and you can even setthe game speed to fast if the normal speed isn't enough for you), and simple to learn/pick up. It also has clean menus and gameplay without a lto of distracting clutter. It's a fun little game for when you just want to play something quick, casual, and without too much thinking (perfect for when you're tired, but you wanna play SOMETHING). I personally enjoy the art and the pirates theme.			"

												I love skill based card games, and this is no exception.  Yes, there is a random facter here, but it's not as bad as other games I have played.  The few times I have lost a match (so far), I have never felt completely cheated; a few times were even because I got entirely too greedy.  The first few matches are a little boring, but once you unlock all the card abilities, the game really shines; and then once you unlock traits it gets even better.  Matches don't last too long, and there is no time limit, so it's a great casual game.  Really glad I picked this one up.			"

												A draw-'til-you-bust card affair simple enough to constitute a game (mostly) about risk management, but complex enough to exceed a tarty pirate-themed two-up competition. As with most card games, probability (and fluke) is a core mechanic, serving to simplify the front-end of the game's nuances, but facilitating various rude surprises and foregone conclusions that may strike players as unfair or indecent.Although play is easily mastered, the game achieves a degree of longevity by posing a vast array of combined challenges and unlocks; although the revolving roster of opponents is exhausted within a couple of hours, there is no shortage of opportunity to interrogate otherwise winning strategies under new, subtly altered rule conditions.

IF you attempt to change the display settings because it loaded up bad for you and you accidentally set the graphics to a higher resolution then you will never be able to fix it. I can now no longer play the game AT ALL. I have even uninstalled it and reinstalled it but it permantly locks it to the bad settings.The game itself is nto that bad even though th luck factor gets tedious as you can be destroying them and then on the last hand they completely flip things arround with some ridiculous combo that they seem to get more often than not. Your odds do improve as you learn to master the combos your self so it is interesting.Still when you consider teh graphic bug can permantly destroy the game even if you uninstall it then it becomes a complete waste of money.

												Dead Man's Draw is a slick and polished head-to-head card game, played against an AI opponent. The rule-set is initially very simple, with more rules and features introduced as the player progresses, providing a smooth introduction to the finer points of playing the game. As with many card games, luck plays an enormous factor in your success or failure, but there is also a significant degree of skill that can be applied to influence the outcome of a game. A single round of the game takes only a minute or two, meaning that this is an excellent ""filler game"" for when you only have 5 minutes to play something quickly. That said, there's a reasonably long campaign-style progression, which continually offers new opponents with various abilities and tweaks to the rules to keep things interesting over many hours of gameplay, and it's easy to get sucked into ""one more round"". Overall, it's a splendid little game.  "

												Fun little game of chance card game which in concept is great, and would be fantastic to play with friends face to face.Unfortunately, the AI is embarrassingly bad. It is a total waste of time to play against it; you will either face-roll it because it doesn't have a clue what to do, or it will just draw the card that matches it's trait over and over and makes the game really artificially difficult.Sometimes it just banks cards for no reason, but when you draw the next set of cards you can see it would have gone bust.I do really like the concept of this game and multiplayer would probably make it worthwhile, even though I think it would lose some of it's charm playing against random people. So unfortunately I can't recommend this game.			"

The pirate themed game play is also pretty interesting with cool art and card abilities.

												An Excellent card game, where strategy really comes into play, as the player unlocks abilities that can be utilized in future games.The opponents' AI is very good -- you won't find the computer taking foolish chances, plus the game does not ""cheat"" to give the computer opponent an upper hand. The computer opponent gets to use abilities too, and based on the goal for that particular scenario level, chooses accordingly.The game plays very quickly and requires the player to determine what is the best strategy to win a scenario level, and pick abilities to achieve that goal.Strategies are unlocked, the more scenarios the player wins. The player can only use a max of two abilities, but has all abilities unlocked to choose from. A player can change abilities each hand, if they so choose.All in all, a very enjoyable card game that plays quickly. If the subject interests you, you will not be disappointed in a purchase.The game also is very stable. I have never had a problem starting it up, or playing it.			"

												An Excellent card game, where strategy really comes into play, as the player unlocks abilities that can be utilized in future games.The opponents' AI is very good -- you won't find the computer taking foolish chances, plus the game does not ""cheat"" to give the computer opponent an upper hand. The computer opponent gets to use abilities too, and based on the goal for that particular scenario level, chooses accordingly.The game plays very quickly and requires the player to determine what is the best strategy to win a scenario level, and pick abilities to achieve that goal.Strategies are unlocked, the more scenarios the player wins. The player can only use a max of two abilities, but has all abilities unlocked to choose from. A player can change abilities each hand, if they so choose.All in all, a very enjoyable card game that plays quickly. If the subject interests you, you will not be disappointed in a purchase.The game also is very stable. I have never had a problem starting it up, or playing it.			"

												Really fun game. Luck based, like everyone says, but most IRL card games are so it's not an issue for me. I like to open it up and play in between other games. It's fun :) I would definitely wait until it's on sale, though.			"

												I haven't played that much of it yet, but so far it's a great little card game. Interesting game rules, fast games that don't take forever (and you can even setthe game speed to fast if the normal speed isn't enough for you), and simple to learn/pick up. It also has clean menus and gameplay without a lto of distracting clutter. It's a fun little game for when you just want to play something quick, casual, and without too much thinking (perfect for when you're tired, but you wanna play SOMETHING). I personally enjoy the art and the pirates theme.			"

												Pros :+ interesting concept for a card game+ simple to learn+ moderately challenging AI+ fast-paced match,can choose for faster animation for faster gameCons :-Sometimes can be very frustrating due to the nature of the game being luck-based. However this can be somewhat mitigated by choosing a correct skill for each corresponding enemy-(very rarely)freeze and crash to the desktop unexplicably. Had this happened twice so far so it's not that bad.-can make you feel repetitive after a whileConclusion :A very good game that is easy and quick to pick up,learn and pass the time with. Good for the price. You might want to pick this up if you're looking for a mini-game that's on par with bejeweled and the likes.			"

												I got a lot of hours out of this game before I kinda burned myself out on it trying to get all the achievements. It is definitely an achievement-fueled game, for me at least. It's a pretty fun little card game that makes you think some and changes things up from game to game. I may go back and finish what I started some day and rate it higher. The music will drive you nuts eventually. Turn that♥♥♥♥♥♥off when it starts to or it will start to make the game a little stressful.  7/10			"

												Now, I've had to change my review because, to their credit, the developer more-or-less fixed my initial key complaint in their biggest patch, namely in the balance of the special traits. Unfortunately, as time has gone on, other complaints have replaced this one, even if they're not QUITE enough to merit another thumbs-down. I'll detail them here so that buyers can make an informed choice. If you'd like details on how the game actually plays, the descriptions and some other reviews/threads should give you the gist.Needless to say, the lack of multiplayer is one gaping flaw, although it should be noted that a good chunk of the player abilities would have to be disabled or revamped for this to work, since some of them do too much to cancel out others to make for consistently balanced matches. And there's no point allowing players to see each other's selections beforehand, since this would just lead to a cyclical bout of power-switching as they keep trying to counteract the other's selections. Still, doing this would make multiplayer perfectly doable.The next complaint is that there is an incredible need for some kind of counter or image to give the player at least some idea of how many cards are currently in the discard pile, which is currently off-screen. Some players can apparently keep track of this mentally without disrupting their experience, but the rest of us often have no idea what to expect once the pile starts to get low, and when choosing whether to take from the discard pile or do something else, it would be nice to be able to tell whether there were many - or even any - cards in the pile altogether.And the final gripe is that, as much as people dismiss the mere suggestion, I think there is some genuine unfairness in the AI's knowledge of the draw deck. I don't think it's deliberate stacking or cheating, but rather a partial failure to partition what the AI SHOULD know (i.e., nothing) from what it actually does. I base this on the sheer number and proportion of cases in which the AI will take unreasonably high risks (namely drawing when it already has four, five, or even six cards on the table and the chance of a bust is high, even though there is nothing protecting most or all of the current cards from loss in the event of a bust) only to be rewarded with exactly the right card or even succession of cards it needs to get the most out of its current hand. I understand the effects of luck, but this particular bit of grand (and situationally specific) ""fortune"" has played out a few too many times for me to be satisfied with that explanation. Combine this with the AI's being generally aware of what's in the discard pile (unlike the player), and there are times when what should have been a fair bout turns into an infuriating, unbroken string of losses for a perfectly completent player. Now, to be fair, the program does sometimes make less-than-efficient or even self-defeating plays thanks to other holes in the programming, and luck does indeed play its role in all cases, so this doesn't really break the game. But it sure makes for a less enjoyable experience than it might have been.Still, for a cheap, renewable diversion, you could do worse.			"

												It's a basic card game that you can play single player. You can progress to different skills that you can use. It is limited in variety, challenge, and rewards, but comfy and easy to pick up and play.Ran flawlessly without issue.Soundtrack is repetitive and limited. Under two dollars is fair and good value.

												Very fun and polished card game.  I would agree on how this game 50% luck and 50% skill so don't be surprised when you start off doing very well and get destroyed by the AI in the last few draws in the deck.  The pirate themed game play is also pretty interesting with cool art and card abilities.  As you play the campaign, card abilities will unlock and game play modes will change as you beat given challenges.   I say if you like card games in general this would definitely be worth a try and i guess it can also be somewhat comparable to Blizzard's Hearthstone card game.			"

												The AI cheats its♥♥♥♥♥off, which takes away from the end game.  It is fun to play, but with no multiplayer and a cheating computer player..... it becomes frustrating and boring fast.   3 out of 5 stars  You will want to keep playing but will soon realize its a dead end you're cruising down.

												Dead Man's Draw is a slick and polished head-to-head card game, played against an AI opponent. The rule-set is initially very simple, with more rules and features introduced as the player progresses, providing a smooth introduction to the finer points of playing the game. As with many card games, luck plays an enormous factor in your success or failure, but there is also a significant degree of skill that can be applied to influence the outcome of a game. A single round of the game takes only a minute or two, meaning that this is an excellent ""filler game"" for when you only have 5 minutes to play something quickly. That said, there's a reasonably long campaign-style progression, which continually offers new opponents with various abilities and tweaks to the rules to keep things interesting over many hours of gameplay, and it's easy to get sucked into ""one more round"". Overall, it's a splendid little game.  "
