												I have died and gone to Minesweeper Heaven. This makes the original Windows game look like a joke. The number of strategies you need to use to solve the puzzles is incredible and gives the game far more depth than Minesweeper. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this game is if you could not beat the original Hexcells. The puzzles here are brutally difficult, much harder than the original, and some may take you hours to figure out. If you're up for a challenge, you'll find that this game truly hexcells.			"

												[I know this shows 0 hours played, but my achievements should prove that I'd previously bought and beaten this game. In fact, I played it three or four times over!]Hexcells Plus is everything I am always looking for in a puzzle game, distilled to a deceptively simple interface. Though comparisons to Minesweeper are not unwarranted, these comparisons miss a crucial difference: in Minesweeper, the final moves often (and annoyingly) come down to chance, debasing all the carefully planned moves you'd made before should you--at the end of a long game--happen to click a mine.In Hexcells (and Hexcells Plus), however, the game gives you JUST enough information to never, ever have to guess. But you will often spend many, many minutes searching for and debating your next move. While the game provides various clues as to where you can find Hexes and numbers, it does not (at least past the first few levels) make this obvious (as it is in a game like Picross, for example, where every column's number of squares is provided). It only provides clues for a limited number of columns, rows, sections, etc.; based on this, and based on tricks you'll pick up and teach yourself as you go along, you'll have to very carefully make your next move.And this is the crucial difference: any mistake you make in Hexcells is your own fault--thus Hexcells corrects an unfortunate norm in the puzzle genre. So, between chess-like demands on your every move, between the security of knowing the game will not force you to guess, between the pleasing visuals and soothing ambient soundtrack, Hexcells Plus is one of, if not THE, best puzzle games I have ever played, and I play many.5/5			"

Game SeriesHexcells Plus is the second game of its' series. Previous game: Hexcells.Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're minimalistic. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. GameplayThere is no difficulty mode option that's assigned. But each of the puzzles has their own difficult.Hexcells Plus basically has same formula as its' predecessor Hexcells. So the objective remains the same. Which is to figure out which cells to make blue and which cells to make black.There are total of three slots with six worlds that has thirty-six puzzles to solve. The first world for each of the three slots are automatically unlocked. Completing one world will unlocked the next one. All of these puzzles can be replayed after the first go around. Please do note that the puzzles in the other two slots are the same as the ones in the first slot.There's no time limit in this game. Allowing the individual take as much time that they want to solve each of the puzzles.There six achievements for this game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.MiscellaneousFinal thoughts, it's an neat game to play and enjoy. As for the game's replay value it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.Reviews for the games in this series:HexcellsHexcells PlusHexcells Infinite "

												Regular Hexcells is like super happy fun puzzle time. Hexcells Plus is the diabolical demon from hell version of the game. It's a whole lot harder than the regular version. There were points where I couldn't find the next logical solution in the puzzle and had to guess. That doesn't mean there wasn't a logical move, just that I couldn't find it! The boards are much bigger and there are added game mechanics that result in more complicated play. It's way more like sudoku, with times when you have make complicated deductions based on the overlap of number clues.If you want a nice, relaxing puzzle game, buy regular Hexcells. If you want a challenge, grab Hexcells Plus. Better yet, both. I think I slightly prefer regular Hexcells just because I like the more relaxing puzzles, but there is a certain sense of accomplishment to be found in Hexcells Plus that regular Hexcells lacks.			"

												Like its predecessor, this is the best puzzle game I have ever played. This is more of an expansion than an actual separate game, but the price is so cheap that it doesn't matter.  Both games are worth far more than the asking price, in my opinion.The music and sound effects are spot-on fantastic, the puzzles are lovingly and painstakingly crafted, and the difficulty progression is just perfect from one puzzle to the next.  Hexcells Plus adds a few things over its predecessor:  additional types of puzzles, a couple of new types of clues, and a bit more difficult end puzzles.I simply cannot recommend both games enough.The mechanics are similar to Minesweeper and if you find yourself clicking the wrong mouse button (like me), you can change the button configuration from the Input tab of the configuration menu when you first start the game.  Also, keep in mind that there is never a time that you must guess.This game makes me feel smart.			"

												The first Hexcells game is basically the tutorial to Hexcells Plus. If you thought the first game was too easy (and let's face it, that surely includes everyone) then this is the real game right here. The first Hexcells only gets interesting in the last few levels; well, Hexcells Plus starts off from that point, so it's logically a much better game. The concept is simple: find which cells are occupied and which are empty using surrounding clues that tell you how many occupied cells are in a row, how many occupied cells are adjacent to each occupied cell, and how many occupied cells are found within a certain radius of an occupied cell. It looks like Minesweeper at first glance, but it's far more interesting than that. Some of the later levels here get pretty tough, and there are times when you find it difficult to believe that it's possible without guessing, but then suddenly you'll spot a line of reasoning that you've missed and a few more pieces of the puzzle fall into place. It's highly addictive, and not to be played at 2am when you're half-asleep. Great puzzle game, recommended, but if you're new to the series then start with the first one.			"

												After Hexcells Plus, previous Hexcells looks like mere demo. Or easy mode. Or rather tutorial for the _real_ game. Hexcells Plus looks visually the same as previous game, including the same achievements and same amount of puzzles. But Plus version adds new mechanics, and is much, much more challenging. I enjoyed it. Too bad that all puzzles are handmade, so no more games possible after finishing existing set. Otherwise I could use this game as substitute for Minesweeper on the regular basis.

What is it?Hexcells is a challenging puzzle game set to an ambient score for relaxing brain-exercise!  The style of gameplay is somewhat similar to ""Minesweeper"" in that you must reveal all the highlighted hexagons based on surrounding clues, but that's where the similarities end...Hexcells: Offers clues horizontally, vertically and diagonally Always has a logically constructed solution (random guessing is not required if solved properly). The variety of clues offer more interesting challenges than Minesweeper In addition, Hexcells Plus offers further clues beyond the immediate perimeter cellsIs it worth it?If you play the game PROPERLY (ie: no cheating with 'random guesses') and solve each puzzle based on logical deduction, you will find the game deeply engrossing and will find many hours of play.  If however you play it like Minesweeper and click on an unknown cell with a wing and a prayer(!), the game will likely feel unremarkable and no different to Minesweeper (especially as it will permit you unlimited mistakes without penalty).  Since not allowing myself to guess and setting myself the goal of ZERO mistakes, the puzzles have been a huge challenge and really enjoyable.			"

												If you had one of the older Microsoft Windows versions, than you might remember the game Minesweeper. You had to find the mines and avoid them by marking them. It worked with some clues, since numbers gave away how many mines are close by.The Hexcells games are very similar to it, but they are not working in square blocks, they come in hexagon shape and often remind of chemical combinations when you open the next level. These shapes make it sometimes hard to figure out what is going on and in later levels you get extra clues for the lines of hexagons and stuff like that.playing Hexcells is fun in a kind of weird way. Even if you don't want to make your math homework, you sit down to ""calculate"" the grids, but it is not that much math anyway, more like drawing lines from dot to dot.Later versions of Hexcells (Hexcells Plus & Hexcells Ininite) are basically the same thing on harder levels and Infinite includes an Endless-Mode that let's you play levels created by chance. Start with the normal game and get infected, this game is addictive and you should consider buying the complete pack right from start.10/10 I think I've seen more hexagons than a beekeeper did "

												I'd give this game a 4/10. The original hexcells was fantastic, one of my favorite puzzle games. This is the same, but... Hexcells is based on the idea of having a clever puzzle game with simple rules. The introduction of the blue tiles that tell you how many other blue tiles are within two hexes, however... It's not a good mechanic. It's not impossible, but it's just not intuitive, especially with the shapes hexes create. You're suddenly dealing with these weird flower shapes where much of the flower is confused by strange colors or parts missing. It's not fun. It's confusing, but not in the way a puzzle should be. It feels like bad design and it comes in very early on. I don't find drawing patterns on the screen to find what I'm supposed to be looking for fun. I'd rather be solving the puzzle than trying to figure out *where* the puzzle is. A simple outline to show where the area is, like was done for the slanted lines in previous games, would have gone a long way.It's not the worst mechanic ever, and I'm sure some people enjoy it, but I personally cannot recommend this game because of it.

												I finished the original Hexcells in less than two hours, figured I could have played some more, and bought this one too. And you get what you order: clever puzzles in the spirit of good old Minesweeper, sans the random guessing element. The difficulty level in Hexcells Plus goes up way quicker than in Hexcells, there are few really easy levels. The more difficult levels can even take up to 30 minutes or so, which started to feel like too much, especially given that you cannot save the game in the middle of a level! Also, it does feel irritating if you make a mistake towards the end of a level after having spent 20 minutes on it, especially if you're after the Perfectionist achievement without cheating.Anyway, the puzzles are hand-made and some actually almost made me laugh out loud when they revealed some perfectly composed, might I say beautiful, hint as to how the blue hexes are set. If you liked the original one, then this offers more of the same, but much more challenge too. (My play time ended up to 11.5 hours, but a couple of times I just left the game running while I was away from keyboard, so I'd say my actual play time is about 10 hours.)			"

												I reviewed the original Hexcells as ""Quite entertaining and good value for money."" While the latter is true (if you like the game), the first part isn't; Hexcells Plus is frustratingly difficult.I'll argue that the game mechanics have changed, and it's straight up not as fun as the first game.Like in chess, you have to be able to think a couple of steps ahead, but if you're unable to do that to a sufficient degree, all hope is lost. If you've played (Microsoft) Minesweeper on 'Advanced', you'll know the feeling of having to guess at least once per game. In Hexcells you'll be guessing a lot and that is frustrating as hell.The game does give you some leeway in regards to the number of mistakes you can make, but while I could make it to the end of Hexcells in about 2 hours, and achieve a perfect score with some determination, I have given up on making it further than the 5th 'World' in Hexcells Plus. There is no difficulty setting, nor a hint system.If there is some sort of system to solving the game (other than what is taught in the first few levels), I certainly haven't been able to figure it out, and the game hasn't led me in the right direction.(Edit: To clarify; the puzzles are 100% solveable by logic and time spent (unlike Minesweeper), but you'll be guessing a lot if you find the game difficult, as I did. This was an unexpected change from the first game, which I found to have a reasonable and enjoyable difficulty level. Had Hexcells Plus had some kind of difficulty setting/hint system, my verdict would have been ""Recommended"".)The new mechanic of showing ""number of blues in a 2-hex radius"" isn't polished; it is a bit difficult to see what is 'lit up', and I found it annoying more than challenging.The (droning) background music is not very good - Hexcells is also better in this regard.The game has 3 ""save slots"" to save progress for different users, which is nice.I'd guess that the time to complete all the levels (if you know that you're doing) is 3-4 hours.

												Hexcells plus is the devil spawn of the simple logic puzzle game that stole our hearts, Hexcells.While at its core, Hexcells is a fun, loving simple logic puzzler, Plus is what happens when demons spawn on the streets and start dragging people to hell. For how the game feels, you can read  my review of Hexcells. Plus is the same game but with much harder levels, which you shouldn't be playing unless you've tasted the sweet fruits of the first one. Plus is hard to the point of getting stuck in a level and just not seeing any way to progress through it any further. It had me guessing on some levels which really should not be done in a logic puzzle. I'm not sure whether I just didn't see the clues or if the puzzles were designed that way. Think of it like eating chili peppers. The mild ones have a rich taste, not too hot and spicy enough to open a pallet of flavors. Plus is what happens when you eat that 700.000 scoville habanero pepper and just cannot taste anything for a week after that. That's kind of how I feel about Hexcells plus. It's still fun, I still kept coming back to it after failing many times. I'd only recommend it if you tried the first game and were left wanting more. 11 hours to 100%.			"

												Hexcells Plus is the same exact game as original Hexcells, but it offers 36 different (more challenging) puzzles.  Hexcells is a minimalistic logic puzzle very similar to classic Minesweeper. You need to find blue cells and numbers show you how many of them are nearby. For one, there is no instadeath. If you make a mistake, you just keep going. Most importantly with a little bit (and sometimes with a lot) of thinking you can figure out where each blue cell is located. Unlike minesweeper where sooner or later you come to a point when you have to close your eyes and guess randomly. Music is very nice and the game itself is relaxing. I recommend buying Hexcells Complete Pack (Hexcells, Hexcells Infinite, Hexcells Plus) because you will definitely want more.			"

At the Time of WritingGame: Hexcells PlusPrice: $3.29*Genre: PuzzleTime Played: 9 hoursPersonal Enjoyment Rating: ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺ ☻GeneralI did give the first Hexcells a not recommended because it was very easy and a bit pricy. At the time of writing that review, I was unprepared to spend another few dollars on Hexcells Plus. One day Hexcells Plus was on sale, and I figured I should give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. This game is certainly an improvement on the first one and I enjoyed it a lot. The puzzles are a bit harder and some present an actual challenge, particularly if you are disciplined and refuse to let yourself make a blind guess. GameplayThe concept of this game is intriguing, adding a few levels of complication and being much more accurate in the solution than Minesweeper is. No guesses are required, everything can be figured out with logic and enough persistence. Harness your inner vulcan!Some of those complications I mentioned include: cells are hexagons, there are more numbers (rather than just being on the cells they are also found on columns and rows), there are different sorts of numbers (some mean that a string of ""mines"" are all adjacent, others that ""mine"" strings are interrupted by a gap). ControlsVery simple - right click and left click. Still no option in game to change which button does what, but you can change it at game launch. However, by now I've become mostly accustomed to them and didn't make too many stupid mistakes by hitting the wrong button.StorylineNo storyline, doesn't need one.SoundRelaxing gentle zen echoie noises. Also, when you click a cell you get nice tinkling chime-like noises. I don't know why that makes it more satisfying to click on cells, but it does!GraphicsVery crisp, clean, and clear. The numbers are reasonably large. Some puzzles form an interesting overall image or pattern, and overall, the puzzles come across as well designed.Pros+ crisp clean graphics whose job is to be functional+ simple controls to grasp+ more interesting concept than random old Minesweeper+ improvements over the first gameCons- still a fairly short game- the option to switch the mouse button actions is outside the gameHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

												Hmmm....what to say? This game was pretty fun. The puzzles are pretty neat, with math and logic being the primary factors. For me, it was a fairly relaxing way to spend an evening. However, there are some random aspects to the puzzles that I feel make some of them pretty cheap. Because of this, you are really needing to memorize the patterns since the occasional question mark instead of a numeric hint throws math and logic out the window.So...what I did was finish each puzzle and unlock enough points to progress to the next set on y own, until I was able to finish the game (which took me around an hour and a half or so, then went back today with a guide and got each one perfect for the final achievement.I would have given this game about an 8.5 out of 10, but the cheap moments sort of work to nullify actual logic and math thus defeating the actual purpose of the game, and so I knock this down to a 6 out of 10. Still a good game, but the random moments force you to rely solely on memorizing the puzzles that have the question marks (this will make more sense when you play it by the way) rather than the intended math and logic. Had they left that randomness out though, this would have been a near perfect puzzle game. Still, I recommend it. You will enjoy it regardless of that huge flaw.			"

												Hexcells Plus is an atmospheric puzzle game with really logic levels on which you never have to guess, but cross-analyse clues to make the right decision.Sometimes you can almost swear you reach the point in a level there are no clues on what to do next, and you'll have to play a dice, but it's just the result of a very well done bunch of intricate puzzles, despite their clean and simple presentation.You have some different kind of clues and it's variations to deal with, which can be hard and confusing, but the game provides you marker features to help you with it.It felts a bit short to me, despite more than 20 hours spent to get perfect on all levels, and i still wanting more. So that's no doubt an awesome game to me and those who also enjoy this style.For those who know the old Minesweeper, the mechanics of Hexcells Plus are similar, without bombs.			"

Hexcells Plus is more or less a standalone expansion pack for the original Hexcells, but definitely more difficult and challenging. There are a few new obstacles and hints in the puzzles that have been introduced since the original game too, which can make problem solving a little more thought-prevoking. If you enjoyed your time with Hexcells, you will definitely enjoy your time with this too. There isn't much else to say here, this is definitely another one to pick up for puzzle fans of all ages.

												I guess I'm all alone here on Steam, but I don't get it. I mean, I get that the puzzles don't require you to guess. That much has been pounded into my head thirty times per discussion board thread. And it's been proven to me to a degree that I accept. Okay. The puzzles don't require you to guess....who cares? They're not fun.I think that the main reason I don't like these puzzles is because if I'm stuck, there's nothing I can really try. What I mean is that the puzzles are completely binary - every space only has two possible choices. So if I'm stuck and I decide that I want to make a guess, I can either guess left click or right click, and my guess is either correct, in which case I know the answer, or it's incorrect... in which case I know the answer. There's no exploration of the puzzle. If I'm stuck in this game and don't want to automatically give myself the answer to the part of the puzzle I'm working on, my only option is to literally just stare at the screen.Link-A-Pix is a good example of an interesting puzzle because while it only has a single solution, it allows me to try many things without giving parts of the puzzle away to me for trying them. If I'm stuck, I don't have to just stare at the screen - I can try to connect the 9s in one place a different way to make room for something else, or I can pick a different 9 to connect to altogether, or I can even completely erase a small section and redo it to see if it makes room for something I haven't connected yet. Link-A-Pix is not at all binary - when I'm stuck, I can actively search for the solution to a single piece of the puzzle without it being handed to me if that guess is wrong.Of course, Sudoku is another great (and probably way more popular) example. How many of you guys have come to the end of a Sudoku board and realized ""Oh crap, something's wrong here""? That's because Sudoku cleverly gives you options and ways to mess up without giving the answer away if you do mess up. Can you imagine if putting a number in the wrong place revealed to you the right number to put in that place? It would be silly because you wouldn't be able to try anything without parts of the puzzle being handed to you every time you make a mistake. And yet, it also only has one solution, and can even be solved without ever guessing.With Hexcells, I can't very actively try anything - I can sit and stare at the same material until one little piece jumps out at me, and then I can sit and stare at the same material some more. Spending hours just staring at the same obscure clues over and over again... is just not fun. I don't find the puzzles to be engaging.I really don't care if you disagree with me. I'm not saying the game was poorly made - like you've all said a million times, the game has logical solutions that do not require you to guess. Okay. I still don't think it's fun. And who seriously recommends a game on Steam that they don't think is fun? I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to pretend that reviewing games is an objective process. No amount of fact can make me like Hexcells, or recommend it to someone. I just simply can't do either one.So, I guess I'm the lone negative review. UPDATE: Yay, a couple people agree with me, I'm not alone anymore.			"

												I really enjoyed the first Hexcells, but my main complaint is that it was far too short. While Plus technically has the same exact number of puzzles, it will last you a whole lot longer--there are new mechanics that make the game far, far more challenging than the first. The same basic gameplay is still here: it's kind of a mashup of Minesweeper and Picross, and it's incredibly satisfying to logically work out all the solutions.If you played the first game, there's two new types of tiles. Black hexes can have a question mark on them; they serve to severely limit the paths one can take to fully solve the board. These end up being an effective way to resolve the primary issue with the game's structure, in that it is otherwise far, far too easy to finish puzzles. The second new mechanic is blue tiles with numbers--the number represents how many blue hexes are present within a two-tile radius. They're great additions; I found them to be a pretty clever way to expand the basic structure of the game.It's absolutely wonderful to have a sequel that provides more of what I enjoyed while also resolving every issue I had with  the initial entry in the series. The first Hexcells honestly just feels like a prototype after playing Plus; I'd still recommend it, but there's no reason whatsoever to play it if you've skipped to Plus.

												The second game in the trilogy is much harder. The challenge went up significantly. You can still complete all levels using only logic and clues without any random luck. The levels are bigger though and unfortunately there are times when you have to look very carefully for the next clue. If you couldn't get enough from the first game, you might like this.			"

												Hexcells is a puzzle game in which you can use hard logic and intuition to solve the puzzles. If all the numbers put you off, t is less mathematical it appears, focusing more on deciphering patterns. The relaxing sounds are a nice contrast to how hard your brain will work. I thoroughly enjoyed all three and highly recommend them.This one has a steeper learning curve than the first. I would suggest playing the first one before this, just to get to grips with it			"

												This is the follow-up to a nice casual puzzle game. It still reminds you a of the classic minesweeper game on Windows with some additional ways to calculate moves.

It does deliver that, but with a few new mechanics that increase the difficulty by a good bit.  I would suggest playing Hexcells before Hexcells Plus, if only because it's easier, and would not present much of a challenge if you've beaten Plus.Overall, a really good casual puzzle game, and if they ever make another sequel, I would not hesitate to buy it.

Hexcells Plus is essentially more of the same puzzle sets introduced in the original Hexcells earlier in 2014. As such, my earlier review comments 'here' still hold true. Where I feel Hexcells Plus differs is in the difficulty. I found most puzzles relatively easy in the original, but in Plus there were a number that kept me scratching my head. These took me approximately 20% longer to get through; I certainly enjoyed the increased challenge.Your deduction & logic skills will need to be sharp to get a perfect run on some of these levels! Well worth playing .. would flex my brain muscles HARDER again! Great puzzle game!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												Quick Note - I played this entirely offline, so it didn't track my play-time at all.  I'd guess a good few hours myself.  Either way, it was time well spent.  This is more of the same kind of fun from the first game, but it kicks up the difficulty a good deal.  In the first game, I defeated most of the early level bundles in a very short period of time.  However, in this game even the earlier levels were taking me longer because of their increased complexity.  It adds a couple of new gameplay elements, which makes the player have to figure out new methods to logically deduce what tiles can be clicked on or eliminated.  I appreciated the increase in difficulty myself, though it did get pretty brutal in the last few levels.  I'd say it's worth playing, especially if you appreciated the new kind of puzzle game from the first title.  Looking forward to trying the last game of the trilogy, see what it has to offer to close off the series.			"

												(9/10) More challenging (and fun) than the original version.  The biggest draw is simply that theres another big pile of puzzles to solve.  Some of which use some new mechanics, and some of which are going to be serious stumpers.  I'd say 'on average' these take around 2x as long to solve as the first batch, which honestly is a good thing.			"

												Logic puzzle game, similar to minesweeper but without the need to guess any moves and sequel to the original Hexcells.Hexcells Plus increases the difficulty over the original game while having only 6 more levels(36 in total) over the original the amount it took me to finish them all was an extra 10 hours.Again like the original every puzzle is fully solvable buy logic alone and like the original it is forgiving with no punishment for guessing or making mistakes.Also again one negative is that puzzles can’t be saved mid game, so you lose progress when you exit, which given the increase in difficulty in puzzles could be a problem.Hexcells Plus is easy to recommend to those wanting harder puzzles over the original; it increases the difficulty and the playtime with it for the same price.I had no technical issues with Hexcells Plus.

Hexcells ReviewThis game is tough! The developer definitely put in a ton of effort making these puzzles - there's always times where you'll get completely stumped for a few minutes, then suddenly notice something you didn't earlier! The game is extremely addicting; I kept getting an urge to play the next puzzle immediately after finishing one!The game does have its flaws, though. There's a special blue numbered cell that creates a highlighted area when clicked on, but that area is white on a white background, which led to me making mistakes more than just a few times. That really ruins your current puzzle, because getting more than 2 mistakes makes you lose your perfect puzzle status, which I went for!Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who even remotely likes puzzles and Minesweeper - it's an extremely unique game with calming music and an ambient atmosphere! :)Oh, and check out Rock Paper Shotgun's review if you haven't yet!

												This is probably my favourite of the three Hexcells games, all of which I enjoyed (I also like Squarecells, but haven't finished it or been back to it in a while).  It develops ideas that are only skimmed in the original game, which seems much simpler in comparison.  If you haven't picked up any Hexcells games yet, I think you could start with this one rather than the first without getting lost or missing much (but why do yourself out of more puzzles?).  If you're a bit nonplussed by the praise for the first game, give this one a go.			"

												There isn't that much to say about a game like this. That's why the Steam description is actually one line, just like the original Hexcells. And this review, that's pretty much the same as my review for Hexcells :)  Like other reviewers mentioned, it's like minesweeper but then much more sophisticated. At first the game may look simple but the further you progress, the more complex is becomes. I found it an enjoyable game. Especially the moments that you solve a complex puzzle without making a mistake. The ambient soundtrack and sound effects also make it a very relaxing game to play. I also think the price is just right. This is a standalone expansion so you don't need Hexcells to play this. But if you buy one of them, why not buy them both? They cost next to nothing. Simply a must buy for puzzle enthusiasts.			"

												You should take this recommendation as being for Hexcells as well as Hexcells Plus - I bought both elsewhere earlier (hence the near-zero playtime, but it seems to have awarded me the achievements for my progress) and they really should be played together. At least, if you're still interested after the first one, which won't take you long to get through. They're both magnificent.Hexcells is often compared to Minesweeper and that's quite apt (also, Sudoku), but where Minesweeper usually devolves into frustrating guesswork, the puzzles in Hexcells are finely crafted individual pieces that (as far as I can tell) always contain just enough information to solve. So often, when the combination of elements that unlocked some part of the puzzle finally revealed itself to me, I would not just feel the wave of satisfaction at my own accomplishment, but would find myself nodding in appreciation, seeing how carefully that whole side of the board was put together.And despite Hexcells Plus containing some incredibly tough puzzles (I have one level left to do at the time of writing), perhaps the aspect most worthy of raving about is that they're both such calming games. The gorgeous ambient soundtrack is...gorgeous, and the developer has enough respect for his puzzles to not add some forced layer of pressure like a time limit. The pace is then whatever you need it to be - for me, the harder puzzles in Hexcells Plus were often a ""leave it on all day, have another look at it in half an hour"" pace - and I love that. Taken together (and they should be, because Hexcells is almost just an introduction to Hexcells Plus), these form a really marvelous little game.			"

												Sequel to Hexcells, Hexcells Plus offers more of the same as the original, excellent logic puzzler but with considerably more challenge. This can be both a good and a bad thing. Because of the higher challenge level, I strongly recommend you to first play the original Hexcells.Game has changed little from the original Hexcells. User interface (UI) is exactly the same as before. Just like in Hexcells, you have to deduce whether hexes are blue or black based on simple rules similar to Hanjies and Mine Sweeper. However, the puzzles are completely new. The sequel adds one new mechanic: now blue cells can also have a number on them that dictates how many hexes in two cells' radius are blue. Still no guessing is required at all: everything can be logically deduced.Music has changed a bit but it retains the ambient theme from the original.Just like in Hexcells, there are 36 well-designed, challenging puzzles. Unlike Hexcells, the challenge level jumps up very quickly, and the further you get, the longer the puzzles will take to complete (assuming you are not guessing and strive for perfection). Coming straight from Hexcells it's alright but starting out it would be a bit too much. Especially the new mechanic of numbered blue cells can make it difficult to understand what's going on, though the UI has a convenient helping function to keep your thoughts straight. Unfortunately at least I had to resort to the infamous ""try and exclude"" deduction strategy way more often in this sequel than in the original game, so the puzzles can drag a lot longer. The lack of saving option within puzzles can become a drag if you find yourself in a hurry.I still recommend Hexcells Plus to anyone who liked the original Hexcells and was left craving for more. The upped difficulty level is more hardcore though and I can't emphasize this quality too much. For me the game took some 10 hours to complete fully, while original Hexcells was just a 2-hour stroll. If you want a smoother difficulty curve and a more pleasant a sequel considering the difficulty level, you should skip straight to Hexcells Infinite that also finally adds saves and random levels.In that effect Hexcells Plus shares many problems of its predecessor: it has limited content that lacks replayability after being completed and saving feature before that. However, it also shares most of its virtues: well-designed, albeit (perhaps) too challenging puzzles (when compared to the original one) with pretty much perfect user interface and audiovisual outlook for its game type. For challenge's sake it continues from where Hexcells was left so in that effect it is also a fine sequel for the puzzle enthusiast.			"

												This game is like a combination between Minesweeper and Picross/Nonogram. 36 puzzles in total, and a great soundtrack. I found the difficulty to be just right, though once you beat all 36 puzzles, you've finished. Still it's totally worth it, and definately worth $3.I recommend buying the Hexcels Complete Pack, which costs $8.99 at full price. The pack includes Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each 36 unique puzzles, which adds up to a total of 108 puzzles. However, Hexcells Infinite includes a puzzle generator, where you put in a string of 8 numbers, or have the game randomly pick, and will generate a puzzle based on those numbers, so you can challenge you friends. Also, instead of pressing the ""generate random number"" button, you can press a button to use the days date, so you can have a 'daily' puzzle too.			"

												Hexcells Plus, much like its predecessor, Hexcells, is a puzzle game which features minesweeper-like playstyle on a hexagonal grid. In it, you are given information about the number of specific tiles (and some context clues of where they lie), and must use logic to determine where the tiles are.Where the original Hexcells was rather easy, Hexcells Plus manages to hit a sublime level of perfection in managing to toe the line of being extremely difficult by the end, while never feeling impossible. I took around 8-9 hours to complete the game, and it's been a long time since I've felt the same level of satisfaction that I did when I finally beat the game.This is an excellent, excellent puzzle game and I cannot recommend it enough. Those familiar with Minesweeper or logical principles can probably feel free to jump in here without having played Hexcells., Those less familiar may want to look into Hexcells first, but keep in mind it's effectively ""easy/intro"" mode - it'll probably take around 1/10th the time to complete.

												This review is mainly a response to the reviews claiming that unlike Hexcells, Hexcells Plus requires guessing to complete the  levels. This is false. The game is certainly more difficult than its predecessor, but no level actually requires guessing. Some places just requires combining information from two or even three different sources, but those sources are plain to see (though sometimes you have to complete other parts of the level to uncover that information). It's not always easy, but with a firm grasp of the mechanics involved you can always figure out 100% which hexes are what. One of the most fun aspects of the game is finding that logic rather than guessing. If you liked the first game and would not mind a more difficult version, I see no reason not to recommend Hexcells Plus to you.			"

I might recommend the sequel Hexcells Infinite over this game though, since it's basically the same, but better and infinitely more levels to play through.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game.

												This game is clever, very clever. As the other reviews will tell you it's a mix of Minesweeper and Picross played on a Hex grid instead of a square one. And that's just the start of it, with additional rules introduced slowly that will definitely keep you challenged.This is the first Hexcells game I've played, even tough it's the second one in the series, because of this the puzzles might have grown harder a bit faster than you might be used to in a game (I know I had to get used to it). I assume Hexcells introduced the basics at a more leisurely pace, however Plus also starts with these basics and assumes no prior knowledge of how to solve these puzzles.All in all there are 36 puzzles, which range from ""engaging"" to ""fiendishly hard"". Later levels are unlocked by playing earlier levels and doing well on them (rated on number of mistakes made, there is no timed element).There are some points where I feel the game could have improved, primarily a mid-level save functionality and the ability to mark black cells as done (or have this done automatically), but these are small issues that do not detract from the entertainment.A solid game that I recommend to anybody looking for a puzzle game that doesn't follow the same tired concepts.

												Ok, after almost being done with the game (still got World 6 to do!), I can honestly say that this is probaby the most difficult, rewarding and entertaining puzzle game I've ever put my time into.I bought the first Hexcells a while back and fell in love with it, but I felt it was a bit easy.  Then I picked this one up.  Hexcells Plus is RIDICULOUSLY harder than the original, and I love it.  I almost never use walkthroughs for these types of games, but one puzzle had me stumped for so long that I had to resort to it once.The puzzles themself are brilliantly designed, and it's clear that the developer put a large amount of time into making sure they were of the highest quality.  The ambient music in the background is wonderful and calming; it also adds to the wonderful experience this game provides.  The graphics are simple but gorgeous and charming.Overall, this is by far one of, if not the best puzzle game I've ever played and there is no reason to not pick it up.  However, this game goes by the assumption that you have played the original Hexcells first, so before you pick up Hexcells Plus, start out with the first one.			"

												It's pretty much minesweeper but instead with squares it's with hexagons along with other hurdles and mechanics into the mix.Good puzzle game. I would get Infinite too as this version is Medium and Infinite is Hard and higher. The base version is good too but Easy I would get them in a bundle instead of individually. Worth it.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.			"

												Much like the original Hexcells, Hexcells Plus is an updated version of the classic strategy game Minesweeper with a bit of added style: you play with hexagons instead of squares. The board starts with an oddly shaped field made of orange hexagons. Mines are marked by left-clicking a hexagon, turning it blue. Hexagons are revealed by right-clicking, showing the number underneath if you click correctly and shaking the piece and adding a tally mark to your mistake count if you're too hasty in your decisions.Unlike the original Minesweeper, Hexcells is a much more complex game involving a board marked with various different types of clues that give the player hints about how many mines are in each column or in the surrounding area of the board. Hexcells Plus expands upon the original Hexcells by giving players an additional thirty-six puzzles to complete with a couple of added gameplay elements. These elements include the dreaded ?, a marking that denotes a hexagon that has an unrevealed amount of mines around it, as well as numbered mines that indicate how many mines are in a two-piece radius surrounding the hexagon.Unfortunately, the addition of ? hexagons adds a somewhat frustrating element to an otherwise well-balanced game. I often found myself encountering large walls of ?'s that split the board in half, preventing me from continuing on without making a few risky clicks based off some logical guesswork. Altogether, I found Hexcells Plus to be fun, but slightly less enjoyable and more frustration-inducing than the original Hexcells (although that, perhaps, might have been caused in part by the ridiculously long span of time I had been playing Hexcells for by the time I reached some of Hexcells Plus's more challenging levels).Nonetheless, Hexcells Plus is an engrossing way to spend an afternoon. Hexcells Plus can be seen as an expansion to the original Hexcells, adding thirty-six new levels for players to complete, or it can be played as a standalone experience, with the basics of the original Hexcells being explained in the earliest levels of Hexcells Plus. After completing the set of levels contained in Hexcells Plus, be sure to check out the original Hexcells or the inexhaustible Hexcells Infinite, which includes a rather effective level generator and the ability to play user-generated content.

												Traditional Rating - 94/100Recommendation - Like Hexcells, but Plus!Remember the free old Windows game Minesweeper? Remember how fun it was finding those hidden mines, and how you could feel your brain scream ""NOOOOOOOOOOO"" whenever a mine would pop its stupid head up and kill you? Remember how immensely frustrating it was when it was entirely impossible to solve levels without guessing?WELL, NO MORE! Hexcells to the rescue. Hexcells is very similar to Minesweeper in that you have to use various clues and reasoning to find the hidden blue cells on each level, but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells' soultions can ALWAYS be reasoned, and if you're doing it right you will never have to guess.The levels start out easy, with simple rules and puzzles, but new tricks are added just regularly enough to fully grasp, and before you know it, you'll find yourself scanning through 15 different criteria to find the 1-in-100 blue cell to start a level off. It's very satisfying.Speaking of satisfying, the puzzles here never seem overwhelming or too tricky. Take my opinion with a grain of salt (since I have always loved games like this), but the level of difficulty in these puzzles was just perfect, and while some levels did force me to stare at them for a while, the solution was always there somewhere just waiting for me to grab it.The Hexcells series is really 3 games: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each have different puzzles, and they are each worth getting, but Hexcells Infinite is the one to get if you're on a budget. It has the most advanced puzzles, and it includes a random level generator, so you can literally play to your heart's content. All 3 of them will slowly progress you through the mechanics of the game, though, so don't feel like you will be overwhelmed if you jump right into Infinite.It's worth mentioning that the random levels in Infinite are mere pale shadows compared to the premade levels (they are often quite easy), but for fans that cannot get enough and don't want to go back to the guess-fest Minesweeper, they can be a lot of fun.I highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of logic-based puzzle games, you can't go wrong with any of these 3 games. The prices are cheap, and the series is rather unique. If the devs could have just tightened up the infinite level generator ever-so-slightly, this game might be the only game I've rated to pass Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.Scratch that Minesweeper itch, my friend!

												I feel bad not recommending this game, but it really cranked the difficulty past the point of being fun for me.Many levels have ""bottlenecks"" where there are only one or two moves you can deduce as being risk-free, and these sections feel deliberately, artificially hard. The signal-to-noise ratio is such that you feel like you're looking for a needle in a haystack. I feel no shame in stating that I had to consult a guide (which had so many pictures that it frequently crashed the Steam browser) just to know which column or blue hex I should focus on to deduce my next move - there's no option to save your progress and resume later, and real-world obligations meant that being stuck for tens of minutes on a single move would mean the difference between finishing the level or starting over from the beginning the next day.Even then, it took me 11 hours(!) to complete Hexcells Plus, versus just 2 hours for Hexcells. And that says it all, really. I had fun, overall, with Hexcells Plus, but it felt too tedious too often for me to recommend it in good conscience.			"

												Copying my review from Hexcells since the games are essentially the same (I had a much harder time with it, though, so that's a plus):Hands down my favorite puzzle game that I've ever played. My only wish is that it would last longer (though your mileage will vary depending on your experience with puzzle games). Think of it as a game similar to Minesweeper, but instead of needing to make guesses every once in a while regarding the position of ""good"" hexes, you always have the information available to make the right call. Purchase Hexcells Plus as well if you enjoy the base game. Can't recommend it enough if you're a fan of puzzle games.			"

												Hexcells is a fun cross between Sudoku and Minesweeper.  The original Hexcells is simple, but this one offers some challenge, especially once the concept of 'double circles' is introduced.  I ended up using the snipping tool on my computer to take screenshots.  Then I could 'draw' the double circles in order to count hexes, because I couldn't visualize the patterns otherwise (not without leaving smeary fingerprints all over the screen!).  Once I figured out that trick, it became doable.  If you enjoy puzzles, Hexcells Plus is definitely worth the few dollars it costs.  You'd do better to buy both, since the original Hexcells teaches the techniques you'll need for this game.  The upper levels of Hexcells Plus have definite replay value, which is a nice bonus.			"

												I found Hexcells Plus to be gnawingly compelling, diving in for one last quick go until I'd finished it. Like a big bag of pork scratchings. It's somewhere between Minesweeper and sudoku in terms of completing each level by unpicking it a cell at a time from the chain of clues, using logic and elimination. It sounds a bit dull when I put it like that, but it had me hungrily searching for an indication of which cell to click next like I was doing a Where's Wally puzzle. Each level gives you a score based on how many mistakes you made, and I made it my mission to get a perfect score on each one. They don't change, so you can learn from your mistakes and, if all else fails, remember a few tricky cells from your last try. If I had any criticisms they would be that it's frustratingly easy to click the wrong button by mistake and wreck your score, and that with no random level option it has limited replay value.			"

												WARNING: If you don't like to stare at a screen for several hours, seeing a big bunch of colored, partly connected cells and you're not able to count -> don't waste your time with this game... and reading any further ;-)Otherwise it's a really nice game and I ""wasted"" around 23h to beat it perfectly. The predecessor took me only 2h.In mid-game the developer introduces a the new blue cell type which shows you the number of blue cells surrounding it. This new feature combined with the old known ones will crack your mind.Level 6-5 took me 3.5h to solve it perfectly in my first turn... I wanted to give up several times because I didn't see any chance in coming further. In the middle I didn't make a click for at least 1h... but suddenly I found the solution for one single cell. And with this new information I was able to keep on track.  And it was in front of my eyes all the times.This are the moments you want to experience when you play this game! You can't really get stucked, but you have hundreds of possible locations where you could go on, but sometimes there is only one single cell which you can determine exactly. And if you find it, you will be very, very happy because you knew you didn't try, your logic succeeded.It's awesome and mind blowing... but ONLY if you really like stuff like this. Then you get a good value for small money.			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Hexcells, Plus and Infinite. Cheesing in the Cells.Genre: Minimalist Casual Atmospheric Number PuzzlersDeveloped & Published by: Matthew BrownPlatform: Windows, Mac and LinuxBusiness Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review about the entire Hexcells Series on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsHexcells is a minimalist puzzle game that I like to think of as a combination of Minesweeper and Sudoku. A comparison that has probably been made elsewhere. Every level is basically the same. You’re presented with a variable number of cells with a number in the top right corner telling you how many blue cells there are in the puzzle. The challenge is figuring out which cells are blue and which are numbers. If you guess incorrectly, it’s counted as a mistake that will affect how many points you get at the end of a level. The numbers on or adjacent to cells are telling you how many blue cells are connected to them. It’s up to the player to figure out the pattern by examining the numbers. In general terms, if there are two unknown cells connected to a cell that has the number “2” on it, they’re both blue cells. There are several different mechanics used to confuse the player and make them logic out the solution. Upon completing a level, you’ll be rewarded with points that are used to unlock additional groups of levels. As such, this does requires you to complete most of the puzzles with a minimal amount of mistakes in order to progress forward. Hexcells: Plus FeaturesPlus is the expandalone title to the original featuring 36 new puzzles and a some new twists. The main new mechanics is a cell that tells you how many blue cells are in a radius around it. Otherwise, the game is as good as the rest and there are some tricky levels in it. It’s not required to be played but if you haven’t gotten enough Hexcells, this adds some more to theoretically sate that hunger. My Main Issue With HexcellsHere’s the problem I have with the entire Hexcells series. It’s a pretty good puzzle experience, if you play it how it’s intended to be played. However, I feel that they have a problematic design flaw: all of the puzzles can be cheesily completed. If you’re stuck at a certain sequence, you can just click through the rest of the puzzle making as many mistakes as you like. (I had some puzzles at 50-60 mistakes). What about the points you would get from a near perfect completion? Well, once you nearly finish the puzzle, take a screenshot and then instantly replay the level with your own personal guide. It’s possible to win all three games this way without much effort on your part. PC Settings & Audio/VideoIt’s a minimalist game so there really aren’t many settings to change. Since its running on the Unity engine, the Unity launcher menu pops up when you start the game every time. It allows you to change resolutions and turn fullscreen on/off. The graphics quality is set to beautiful and can’t be changed. However, I was able to play this on a basic, five year old laptop running Linux Mint and there was absolutely no trouble running it. Alternative keys can be changed here as well. Hexcells Infinite was the only game of the three that allows you to swap the left and right mouse button functions. Final ThoughtsOverall, I think the Hexcells series is a decently executed puzzle idea with plenty of content. I take issue with the lack of anti-cheat but it's not enough to make it an anti-recommendation. (Thanks to a friend for making a case to change my mind on this). It’s a fun logic number puzzle series. And I did play the three games how it was intended too, with a few exceptions. I had quite a bit of fun deducing the my way through the levels and had several “aha!” moments despite it’s more casual nature. Additionally, it maintains a mellow and atmospheric experience that I can appreciate. While there is the less honorable part of myself thinking “you can just easily ‘cheat’ this game and not spend hours on it”, that doesn't disqualify it from being a decent puzzle game. So, if you can avoid cheating yourself, get the Hexcells series. But if you can’t restrain yourself from looking up help on even the slightest bit of challenge, I probably wouldn't get it. Otherwise, that's my thoughts on this series. Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												If you've played the original Hexcells, this version has harder puzzles, and is definitely a challenge for people familiar with this style of game. If you have not played the original Hexcells, I highly recommend buying that game first; the puzzles are more suited to people just starting this series.I highly recommend this game, with a personal recommendation of buying the original game first. Even if you're adept at puzzles, it's a good refresher to do well in this version.This is a copy+paste of my review from the original. Gameplay is the same, the puzzles are just harder:-------Hexcells plays like Minesweeper, using hexagons instead of squares. However, unlike Minesweeper which is randomly generated, each level in Hexcells is pre-made by the developer to have a unique and deducible solution. There are bits of spacial thinking that come in play, from crossword puzzles like Sudoku.Hexcells also takes the minesweeper playstyle and increases the complexity (always offering a deducible solution though), by introducing row/column markings in lieu of additional viewable pieces, as well as special tile number markings that denote certain behavior of where the blue pieces will be.I was a bit skeptical at first, but I'm really enjoying this series. I'm not noticing a terribly large complexity in this game, but I haven't gotten to the other two Hexcells games yet. I would recommend to people who enjoy puzzles.			"

												Mindbogglingly amazing logic puzzles, each intricately crafted to be solvable without guessing. Despite simple interactions (you only need to mark cells black or blue) there are lovable hidden details all over the place. Solve some of one section until you just can't move forward, and that's when you notice that you've uncovered the solution to the other section. As soon as you think you've figured out every trick for a puzzle method, it throws something new at you. It's not the first logic puzzle to offer these, but it does it in so many different and interesting ways. You'll be tempted to guess and take the risk of making a mistake. Don't. First off, you're going to make your own mistakes anyway. Secondly, you're spoiling the amazing ways you can solve these puzzles. They are so clever while being completely discoverable. So good that it's worth going back to puzzles you messed up on and figuring out how to get it with no mistakes. I generally don't like it when the best way to play a game is with mental rules like this, but Hexcells is so good that I'm so willing to overlook that. Play this game.			"

Simple idea, but because you need to use 2 or 3 levels of counter-logic to complete certain sections of some puzzles, with the extra information piece, and harder puzzles, this was a great sequel to the original. I got about 3 times as much time out of Plus going for the perfectionist achievement as I did with the original.			"

												This is the second game in the Hexcells trilogy, and I HIGHLY recommend you play the first game (Hexcells) before attempting to play this one.While the first game provided wonderful puzzles and brain-stretching ""Minesweeper crossed with Sudoku"" logic, the second one cranks up the difficulty.  Don't be too alarmed, because the game also provides a new puzzle mechanic that adds a whole new twist to solving the puzzles.  When you solve these new puzzles, the sense of satisfaction is also cranked up another notch.The number of puzzles and the increasing difficulty of these puzzles definitely makes Hexcells Plus a 15-to-20 hour endeavour to finish, assuming that you feel the need to get the ""Perfectionist"" achievement for solving the puzzles without an error.I highly recommend this game.

												This is a logic puzzler at its finest!It has a few simple rules and an intuitive 2 button interface.The best thing about this game however are the 36 carefully craftet puzzles, each one is solvable by applying strict logic, there is absolutely no guessworking ever - that's how it should be :-)If you like picross or similar games then you should definitely take a look at this gem.

												If you've played the original Hexcells, this version has harder puzzles, and is definitely a challenge for people familiar with this style of game. If you have not played the original Hexcells, I highly recommend buying that game first; the puzzles are more suited to people just starting this series.I highly recommend this game, with a personal recommendation of buying the original game first. Even if you're adept at puzzles, it's a good refresher to do well in this version.This is a copy+paste of my review from the original. Gameplay is the same, the puzzles are just harder:-------Hexcells plays like Minesweeper, using hexagons instead of squares. However, unlike Minesweeper which is randomly generated, each level in Hexcells is pre-made by the developer to have a unique and deducible solution. There are bits of spacial thinking that come in play, from crossword puzzles like Sudoku.Hexcells also takes the minesweeper playstyle and increases the complexity (always offering a deducible solution though), by introducing row/column markings in lieu of additional viewable pieces, as well as special tile number markings that denote certain behavior of where the blue pieces will be.I was a bit skeptical at first, but I'm really enjoying this series. I'm not noticing a terribly large complexity in this game, but I haven't gotten to the other two Hexcells games yet. I would recommend to people who enjoy puzzles.			"

												WARNING: If you don't like to stare at a screen for several hours, seeing a big bunch of colored, partly connected cells and you're not able to count -> don't waste your time with this game... and reading any further ;-)Otherwise it's a really nice game and I ""wasted"" around 23h to beat it perfectly. The predecessor took me only 2h.In mid-game the developer introduces a the new blue cell type which shows you the number of blue cells surrounding it. This new feature combined with the old known ones will crack your mind.Level 6-5 took me 3.5h to solve it perfectly in my first turn... I wanted to give up several times because I didn't see any chance in coming further. In the middle I didn't make a click for at least 1h... but suddenly I found the solution for one single cell. And with this new information I was able to keep on track.  And it was in front of my eyes all the times.This are the moments you want to experience when you play this game! You can't really get stucked, but you have hundreds of possible locations where you could go on, but sometimes there is only one single cell which you can determine exactly. And if you find it, you will be very, very happy because you knew you didn't try, your logic succeeded.It's awesome and mind blowing... but ONLY if you really like stuff like this. Then you get a good value for small money.			"

												A fun and challenging logical puzzle game similar to MineSweeper.Using the numbers to work out which tiles to mark.The big difference between Hexcells and Minesweeper is that you never need to guess at any point, there's always a way to work out where to click.Also, numbers can be shown on the outside of the grid and show a different symbol with the number to tell you how the tiles you need to mark are laid out.The only issue I have with this is that it's really short and there's no replay value in it.If you wish to save a bit of money then I suggest only buying HexCells Infinite which contains the same as this but also has a random level generator for.. infinite.. replayability.

												This series is criminally overlooked.After the simple breeze through Hexcells in comparison, Hexcells Plus dialed up the difficulty significantly. This installment is where the rubber met the road for me.If you enjoy games like sudoku, you will find logical puzzles here that work your brain for hours. While a naive comparison, the game plays similarly to a very advanced Minesweeper. By the second act, though, you'll have discovered the futility of that comparison; this game is on an entirely different level and has an elegance in the solutions that random Minesweeper puzzles cannot ever hope to achieve.A couple of the puzzles stumped me for more than an hour, and my roommate rapidly grew tired of me talking the solution out loud as I moved my mouse around. There's a brilliant simplicity to the gameplay and yet, while playing, one must keep a large amount of logic in their head. It's easy to get overwhelmed by logic in one area of the puzzle while overlooking the simple move forward in another area, and the feeling is intense when you slap your forehead in stupidity on discovering it.The soundtrack is quite relaxing, and even after working on the same puzzle for an hour it did not grow tiresome. It's really fun when you get on a ""roll"" of solving the puzzle, too, because you generate little ditties as a reward.The entire Hexcells series contains puzzles that are among the greatest I've ever solved. I highly recommend the entire collection, and also very strongly recommend that you start with Hexcells. It is easier than the other two, this one included, by far. For perspective, I am not the greatest logician, and I invested about 15 hours solving this campaign -- for 15 hours of gameplay, this game is a steal.			"

												Hexcells plus is a standalone game that's a follow on from the original hexcells. The concept of minesweeper/sudoku is still the core of the game and just like the first one the soundtrack is excellent.The first hexcells managed to achieve a perfect difficulty curve where you never really got stuck for long periods of time which kept the game ticking over and enjoyable. Unfortunately, this one gets too difficult too quickly. There's barely any instruction as to the rules of the game and as this is a standalone from the first one, you shouldn't have had to play the first one to understand the rules.By the time I got to the 2nd set of levels (2/6 through the game) I was already getting stuck for 5-10mins fairly often which just became boring and frustrating. It's not like other puzzle games where if you spend that long you might find a good chunk of the solution which makes the effort rewarding. You can literally spend minutes upon minutes staring to uncover a few more cells only to get stuck again because of how big some of the levels are. Maybe it's the way I play; I know there is always a logical way to move forward in the puzzle so I refuse to guess. But in no way does the game punish you if you do guess. You fail if you guess wrong too many times, but it should be like minesweeper where if you make a single wrong move you've failed the whole level. This is a hard game to give a thumbs up or down; it is very cheap so is worth getting. I think it would be a good idea to buy the other two hexcells and play them first. So then you become very familiar with the game and learn the strategies, then you can come to this one and enjoy it.So, certainly don't buy this if it's going to be your first hexcells game. But also don't but it if you haven't play hexcells and hexcells infinite first. Otherwise, it is a good buy to complete the hexcells collection.			"

												The addition to the original Hexcells game.AddendumI already wrote a review about Hexcells and how much I love it. This game can be completed with pure logic and process of elimination, though the difficulty curve on this additional content is much steeper. If you're up for the challenge, then go ahead! It's definetly worth the price. Here is my original Review for ""Hexcells"".Originally posted by Enix:A compelling puzzlegame, as an obvious big brother of Minesweeper.ContentMany puzzles await your solving. Go through different levels of difficulty and solve all of the puzzles to get to 100%. Can you get every one with no mistakes?Hexcells (apparent from the name) adds new dimensions to the classical game of Minesweeper: More adjacent fields to one hexagon as well as border numbers, which indicate how many fields of the pattern are in a line/row/diagonale. Each boder number can indicate different things, everything is explained within the game. No need to rush things. You are now thinking outside of hexcells.Sound & MusicShallow but fitting background soundtracks and sounds. Nothing special, but that wasn't needed here. The soundtrack and soundeffects change every once and a while when you complete a puzzle.GraphicsDon't expect anything here. The game is primarily a puzzle game, so no high end graphics or effects. The design does its deeds and fulfills its task. Visuals are never irritating and do what they need to do.WeakpointsSometimes, portions of the soundtrack are a little too high-pitched in my opinion. This can get annoying, if you are not used to hearing the same sounds over and over again. They are adjustable ingame though, from soundeffects only to completely mute.Concluding ThoughtsGreat puzzlegame, compelling, challenging, tricky but fair. Nice soundtrack, nice sounds, simple gameplay yet sometimes mindwreckingly hard. Don't worry, if you are the enthusiastic puzzle type of gamer, you will get used to loving this game! "

												The puzzles start off taking a few seconds / a minute and end up taking over an hour. The idea itself is rather simple (or perhaps minimalistic). When the puzzles hit their full size and complexity the result is fantastic. It feels a bit like a mix between Minesweeper and Sudoku, but is much more than that.There is no guesswork, every step can be worked out logically. Sometimes the next move will be hidden from you, but with enough patience you can finish with the ""perfectionist"" achievement. It took me a total of 10.9 hours, but I had practice on the first Hexcells.			"

												Hexcells Plus is 36 more levels of the wonderfully satisfying (and somewhat melodic) puzzle game Hexcells. The difference here is that whereas Hexcells is beatable in a couple of hours, Hexcells Plus is much trickier and will probably take you longer. This is good in that it's more challenging, although sometimes the puzzles got so big and tough that I found myself pulling hair more than ""enjoying"" them. Nonetheless, I recommend this game if you love simple but challenging puzzles.			"

												Mindbogglingly amazing logic puzzles, each intricately crafted to be solvable without guessing. Despite simple interactions (you only need to mark cells black or blue) there are lovable hidden details all over the place. Solve some of one section until you just can't move forward, and that's when you notice that you've uncovered the solution to the other section. As soon as you think you've figured out every trick for a puzzle method, it throws something new at you. It's not the first logic puzzle to offer these, but it does it in so many different and interesting ways. You'll be tempted to guess and take the risk of making a mistake. Don't. First off, you're going to make your own mistakes anyway. Secondly, you're spoiling the amazing ways you can solve these puzzles. They are so clever while being completely discoverable. So good that it's worth going back to puzzles you messed up on and figuring out how to get it with no mistakes. I generally don't like it when the best way to play a game is with mental rules like this, but Hexcells is so good that I'm so willing to overlook that. Play this game.			"

												Hexcells Plus is a puzzle game and a sequel (or stand-alone expansion) of a Hexcells. A minesweeper style puzzle game, which has hexes and 36 levels of non-randomized logical puzzles.it isn't revolution of some sorts. It's just ""more of puzzles"". Same logical ""there is always a way"". Still have to figure out a path to victory based on all info that hexes give you as you clean the field. Still same ambient soundtrack and graphics. Just 36 more levels?Well, here is a catch: it's not 80% tutorial, unlike Hexcells. It still introduces elements, for new players, but does it quickly, and then sends you to figure out the challenging puzzles, varied and with ""aha!"" moments. THE real game of Hexcells.Oh, and it introduce one new element, where some blue (mines) hexes show the amount of other blue hexes in a big radius, as a number. Yay, not just new levels.Oh. And new players, do try not to just cheat and get the map of the non-randomized puzzles by just clicking on everything and then replaying level perfectly. It's more fun to figure it out by yourself in a honest way, restarting as soon as made a mistake.So yes, definitely pick this Hexcells Plus, possibly skipping the Hexcells, if you don't want to get whole bundle! It really is the meat. Though, Hexcells Infinite, the last in trilogy, is as good too, check that one out.			"

I totally recommend this game, however I want to point out a big issue which is really annoying and game ""breaking""I really enjoy playing this game because it's very good brain and attention training and I'd totally recommend it to anyone because the price is great for what you get (Brain training, attention training).For me as a programmer it helps improving my attention when programming a lot, this is the main reason I own this game.So all in all it's awesome.Let's get over to a very annoying issue which can break your joy.The problem is the wiggling orange Hexcells, once you hover over them. The wiggling motion reveals what's hidden behind them. For example I am using my mouse to keep my attention on a Row/Column and I hover over one cell. It wiggles and reveals what's underneath so either it is blue or black and once I see that I already know without thinking. It's very distracting a frustrating because I missed the chance of thinking on my own.Please fix (make it grey or something, or orange below)!			"

You can leftclick to make the areas visible.The half of the game was very joyful and challenging. But the higher levels are almost unsolveable.

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | 2 *3*] = ~88% (75%-100%)I recommend that you buy the Hexcells Complete Pack with all 3 games - that's why this review text is identical for all 3.It's a great puzzle game series that strongly reminds of Microsoft Minesweeper, but not only is the grid hexagonal (meaning 3 instead of 2 axes), the games even go well beyond mere neighbor-field estimation.The levels eventually get very hard, and the procedural mode in ""Hexcells Infinite"" that exists in addition to the hand-crafted levels all three games have is a bit too chaotic (and hard) for my personal taste - well, it's procedural, its levels are not nicely designed and organized like the other levels.Anyway, since I wanted more of the easier puzzles and especially of the feature that numbers at the grid's periphery say something about the grid's content, I made a (very crappy) puzzler[dreamspace-president.com] in a few hours after finishing the Hexcells games that helps a bit with those needs.Hey, Matthew Brown, if you ever make a game like this again, I'm very likely to buy it, and I bet there's a bunch of people out there who think alike.For those who like this kind of puzzle game, I can't recommend the Hexcells games enough.

Als ich so etwa Level 15 erreicht habe hab ich zufällig auf die Uhr geschaut und war ganz überrascht dass es schon 2 Uhr morgens war.Das Spiel macht einfach süchtig.Im Prinzip ist es eine Art verbessertes Minesweeper. Das Spielfeld besteht aus Sechsecken, und man muss alle blauen Felder finden (entspricht bei Minesweeper den Minen). Dazu zeigen die anderen (nicht-blauen) Felder immer an, wie viele der 6 benachbarten Felder blau sind. Zusätzlich kriegt man manchmal noch gezeigt wenn diese benachbarten Felder zusammenhängend sind, oder wie viele blaue Felder in einer Spalte oder Diagonale insgesamt liegen.Spätere Level werden natürlich immer schwieriger, mit immer weniger Hinweisen welches Feld man als nächstes mit 100%iger Sicherheit aufdecken kann. Es sind aber alle Level eindeutig lösbar ohne auch nur einmal raten zu müssen.Für Leute, die Minesweeper mögen und auf Knobelspiele stehen sicherlich eine lohnende Anschaffung			"

												It takes everything that made Hexcell great and pushes it even further. Everything that was barely introduced in the first game is exploited at its fullest here. Consequently, the game is much longer. Maybe even too long: by the end, you get tired by the concept, and the grids take forever to analyse. Play it if you did not get enough from Hexcell, but accept that you may not finish it (and even then, I would rather recommend the hexcellent third opus, Hexcells Infinite!).			"

The other mechanics get more room to breathe when the empty hexes aren't necessarily providing information as to where the blue hexes are.

												Hexcells Plus is basically a much more difficult version of Hexcells.  It shares the same basic design of a sort of combination between minesweeper and picross, but adds two more hint types: Stacked row hints and area hints.  While the puzzles are much larger and more difficult, they can still be solved without any guessing though it takes a lot more work to do so.  This version has 6 more puzzles than the original, 36 total, and takes much longer to complete.  It took me about 5 times as long as the 30 puzzles in the original to complete without guessing for a total completion time of about 5 hours.Hexcells is a full, well-crafted puzzle game but I would only recommend the Plus version to people who are very good at logic puzzles or extremely patient.  The difficulty is high enough to be undesirable for some people.			"

												Like the original Hexcells, I believe this game offers too little value for your buck, but it's still worth getting at a slightly reduced price.  I simply wish it was longer.  This would be an easy game to 100% if you're into that, but the original Hexcells is much easier.  Expect about 2 hours worth of gameplay if not cheating.			"

												Ich mag diese Art von Knobelspielen.Als ich Hexcells zum ersten mal gespielt habe war es etwa 22 Uhr abends. Als ich so etwa Level 15 erreicht habe hab ich zufällig auf die Uhr geschaut und war ganz überrascht dass es schon 2 Uhr morgens war.Das Spiel macht einfach süchtig.Im Prinzip ist es eine Art verbessertes Minesweeper. Das Spielfeld besteht aus Sechsecken, und man muss alle blauen Felder finden (entspricht bei Minesweeper den Minen). Dazu zeigen die anderen (nicht-blauen) Felder immer an, wie viele der 6 benachbarten Felder blau sind. Zusätzlich kriegt man manchmal noch gezeigt wenn diese benachbarten Felder zusammenhängend sind, oder wie viele blaue Felder in einer Spalte oder Diagonale insgesamt liegen.Spätere Level werden natürlich immer schwieriger, mit immer weniger Hinweisen welches Feld man als nächstes mit 100%iger Sicherheit aufdecken kann. Es sind aber alle Level eindeutig lösbar ohne auch nur einmal raten zu müssen.Für Leute, die Minesweeper mögen und auf Knobelspiele stehen sicherlich eine lohnende Anschaffung			"

												First one was really good minesweeper+nonogram with occasional slips, but this here is just terryfying amounts of grindy brainless busywork, by which only autist on ADHD medication (spoiler: it's meth) won't be driven to madness with percieved dead ends and trial-and-error gameplay.Even with all new mechanics (which are not that well refined — they mostly hit player agency without any payoff), some of which have potential, level design is weak and only reinforce hopeless feeling of conveyer-belt repetative grind. It's seems like just more of the same, and despite relatively short full completion time you can spend eternity on down-time, making unpayed work of a buchhalter of crunching unending rows of same entry-level math numbers and basic operations.It's just unenjoyable by people who think too fast for kindergarten count-on-fingers-math problem solving due too all setbacks and bumps on a road which not even nearly can be called autobahn.

												It takes everything that made Hexcell great and pushes it even further. Everything that was barely introduced in the first game is exploited at its fullest here. Consequently, the game is much longer. Maybe even too long: by the end, you get tired by the concept, and the grids take forever to analyse. Play it if you did not get enough from Hexcell, but accept that you may not finish it (and even then, I would rather recommend the hexcellent third opus, Hexcells Infinite!).			"

There's NO single level which you have to guess, so all is about logic. This is a slow pace game. Lot of patience is required. The problem is there's only 36 levels, kind of a short game.			"

PROS:+ satisfying gameplay+ really nice UI & menu+ relaxing soundtrack (not as good as Hexcells though)+ more chalengingCONS:- longer than Hexcells (35+1 levels) but still could use a couple of levels- you have to guess what to do next in most cases- could use resume option when exiting a levelComment:An okay game that makes you think more and more as the levels progress. Overall it is a good ""time waster"" when you have a couple of minutes to play. Hexcells had a couple of points where you would more or less just guess what tile to choose. Hexcells Plus has a lot of this and it can be really frustrating. I still do recommend this to anyone who likes logic games. Also worth mentioning are two sequels, all three games can be bought in a nice bundle.			"

It's approach is entirely logical, each puzzle can be solved purely by thinking and combining different clues on the board. It's simplistic design underlines the fact that it's really all about brain work and the nice ambient background music alleviates the pain of solving some of the puzzles.In my opinion Hexcells Plus has got the whole package for an insanely small price.

												An amazing example of how to take something good and ruin it. While the original was a fun, challenging, and relaxing puzzle game, Hexcells Plus throws that away in favor of making it frustratingly difficult. The introduction of new mechanics was a good idea, but so miserably executed that it sucked out every bit of fun that the original had. Most of the ""puzzles"" near the end were just guessing.It comes with the same amount of content as the original for the same price, but totally isn't worth it. I'm really glad I didn't pay for this, because I didn't enjoy it. Get normal Hexcells instead.			"

												Hexcell Plus is basically a set of fixed ""mine sweeper""-type levels where the controls are inverted and every cell has six neighbors instead of eight. Once you've completed each level they have about as much replayability as a solved sudoku. The game itself takes about 2-3 hours to solve and yet another hour to master (solve without making any mistakes at all). So far so good, it's more or less the same thing as picking up one of those puzzle books in the book store. A fun short collection of puzzles. My problem is that, unlike a book, the game forces you to solve the levels in a certain order, where the ""harder"" ones are locked until completion of the first ones. That in itself might not have been so bad if it wasn't for the fact that the game just DELETED MY SAVED PROGRESS. The second time I started the program all the further levels were locked again.			"

												Hexcells is, on the most basic level, a more sophisticated version of Minesweeper. You are given a layout of golden hex tiles, possibly with one or more of them already highlighted or flipped. Flipped tiles have numbers on them, and also labels indicating whether or not adjacent tiles which should be highlighted are continuous or non-continuous (or no designator at all). There are also row and column labels which allow you to see how many tiles need to be highlighted in any given row or column.Each puzzle mixes these up in a unique way to push you to solve it.Thinking about this game as a more sophisticated version of minesweeper is, I think, fairly ideal, because that is more or less what it is, and the function it serves. It is something to throw away a bit of time on, not sit down and play continuously.It is about as fun as Minesweeper is, and I’d basically consider it filling that role in your game library.That said, Hexcells Plus, as a sequel to the original game, is designed for people who have beaten it; if you haven't beaten the first game, this is much harder (and some of the puzzles, especially the very last couple, were extremely frustrating; I still don't know how you are supposed to solve the very final puzzle correctly).My advice? Pass. It isn’t a bad puzzle game, but it isn’t anything remarkable either. If you did get it as part of a bundle or something, it isn’t a terrible thing to install and just screw around with when you’d mess around with solitaire or minesweeper or whatever, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to buy this.

												I'm not one to normally leave Steam reviews for a game, particularly not negative ones, but I feel the need to point out this problem as no one else seems to have done so. I have played the original Hexcells and quite enjoyed it, getting perfect on each level. While I liked the first game my only problem with it was the few occasions where the game forced you to guess, with literally no way to logically figure out a puzzle without risking a mistake, and having to try it again if you were going for perfect scores. Hexcells Plus claims to be more difficult, but I feel this isn't due to any real increase in difficulty, but due to artificial difficulty, particularly directed towards players who try to get perfect scores. I've finished the first three worlds, halfway through the game at this point. There have not been any new mechanics which make the game more difficult introduced, but I believe every level so far I have had to restart due to being forced to take a risk and failing. There is no logical way to solve the puzzles correctly on your first try, and the game turns into repeating levels over and over while trying to remember what to do with the spaces that have no way to be figured out. If you look at more traditional, non video game puzzles, there is usually a way to solve them without resorting to guesswork. This would have been easily possible with Hexcells Plus but the developers chose not to so they could artificially enhance the sense of difficulty. I really don't understand how this game has gotten so much praise when it's such a terrible sequel and none of the levels are well designed.Summary: Levels force you to guess rather than using logic, very poor level design overall compared to the first game.

												I bought Hexcells and Pluss for 2.49, which is all they are worth.  The original was fine, completed in a few hours, but the Plus version is horrible.  They cannot be solved by logic, since enough information is never given, but a whole lot of guessing, which leads to mistakes, not too many to complete the puzzle, but they accumulate and you're not allowed to progress to the later levels with too many mistakes, and you can't figure which puzzles you can improve on since it doesn't tell you how many mistakes were on each level.  This is a sick attempt at replayability.			"

												Very challenging game at later levels. I could win some off memory of mistakes on previous attempt, but I found myself going back to the level again and again trying to figure out WHY the hex was black, or WHY the hex was blue.Only thing I wish is if it had more levels, especially awesome if they somehow made it possible to generate random ones, although that is likely very difficult to code.Overall I'd say 8.1/10 for a puzzle game. And I don't look at puzzle games often.Graphics         10/10Concept         10/10Addiction        8/10Length            7/10Replay Value (after all puzzles beaten perfectly)  3/10			"

												It's a hexagonal Minesweeper, guys, and basically a standalone level pack based on the regular Hexcells – not an enhanced version but ""more of the same"". Try the regular Hexcells first, see how you feel about it.The ""Plus"" version's levels are huge. Unfortunately for me, my brain's pattern recognition breaks there and I start to believe huge levels like these aren't possible to beat purely on logic – I thought there's a couple of levels you need to rely on guesswork to advance, but it would battle against the grain of the game so I'm going to assume I'm the guilty party, not the game. At first some of the levels appeared entirely unbeatable by using logic, but then again a lot of my favourite games incur an initial feel of despair.One initial gripe of mine was that unlike Minesweeper, there's really no penalty to messing up – you get a score reduction and advancing to the final levels requires a certain amount of points, so you're either puzzling through them like you should, or trial-and-erroring through them and then ""beating"" them with zero mistakes via memorization or screenshots just to advance to the new puzzles. (I didn't do this.) However, if you play the game fair and square, the pressure to stay frosty and not to mess up during the later stages of a huge level is tangible. Really good.I initially felt I shouldn't recommend Hexcells Plus at all, but I changed my mind. Get the regular one first, and this after that if you want SUPER HARD MODE levels.			"

												If you liked the first one, this one is a no-brainer buy!This is a good addition to the series, following up with all the clever things the first one was praised for and increasing the difficulty yet by having more complex puzzles. There's a bit of assumption that you're somewhat familiar with the mechanics, since the tutorial pretty much skims through the 'new' mechanics that were thoroughly tackled in the first one, but it's so that there are more levels that actually challenge you.On that note, the puzzles start requiring more complex thinking than those in the first one, and you'd more easily get stumped here by overlooking minute details. Tricks such as how many are remaining and the overlapping ranges are slyly used to hide the correct path, and it was masterfully done.And yes, there still is ALWAYS a proper solution; you never need to guess - much as you'd want to in your frustration.Brilliant game. Will heavily recommend this, as with the first one.			"

												Hexcells Plus is not just adding more puzzles to the original game. It's adding new and more difficult puzzles. Things get very hard very fast as the game introduces more gameplay elements. If you have not played Hexcells, I recommend getting it before you try out Hexcells Plus. If you did not enjoy Hexcells, you will certainly not enjoy this harder version.			"

Experienced logic puzzle players may want to start here, while those who don't play much logic puzzles should start with the original.There is a new mechanic introduced, blue cells that have a number, but it's not too big a change to how the game plays.

												Several features have been added to the original Hexcells to make this more puzzling; not all black hexes have numbers, now, and there are a number of other classes of hints. World 3 level 6 seems to require at least second-order thinking, there is no immediate starting point as there was in every Hexcells level. My one complaint is with the music: more ethereal than in Hexcells, which makes it no longer reasonable to delay the mouse feedback sounds until the next beat, as the beats are imperceptible.			"

												First of all, if you're considering getting this before playing regular Hexcells - don't.  Hexcells Plus is far more difficult than the original and for me, that sapped some of the fun out of it.  I LOVE the original Hexcells and recommend it wholeheartedly.  It's a casual, relaxing little game that introduces you to some new puzzles that will stretch your mind a little by challenging you to think in a new way.  A lot of people compare it to Minesweeper, with the major distinction being that you never have to guess in Hexcells.  You can reach the solution to each puzzle with logic alone.  The difficulty curve on the original is great and most likely the whole way through you're going to have a smile on your face and feel enough of a challenge as new methods are introduced.  Is it going to leave you wanting more?   More than likely.  That's where Hexcells Plus comes in and why I was really looking forward to it.  Did it provide me with more Hexcells? Yes.  Did it give me more of the Hexcells I love? No.  The new puzzle solving techniques introduced in Hexcells Plus, although a logical progression, take it too far.  What the original Hexcells has in common with Minesweeper (other than searching a grid to mark empty and occupied tiles) is an addictive simplicity.  In Hexcells Plus, by making things more complicated to up the difficulty level, some of that charming simplicity is lost and sorely missed.  Bottom Line - Hexcells Plus is not simply more Hexcells.  It will most appeal, I think, to people who felt the original was too easy.  I thought the orignal was just right.  Hexcells Plus isn't a bad game by any means and I'm happy to support the developer but it's hard not to compare it to the original and be a little disappointed.			"

												This is a game of patience and logic. It's a fun twist on what is essentially minesweeper and nonograms. There are 36 puzzles in this expansion, and each one has been carefully crafted to always give you enough information to complete without any guessing at all. It took me around 8 hours to solve each puzzle perfectly and unlock all 6 achievements, and I would consider myself to be pretty good at these games.The later levels will make you sit and think and evaluate every possibility one-by-one. There are even a few times when you'll have to make a connection between two clues, but for the most part you won't go outside the realm of 1 or 2-step logical inferences. If you like logic puzzles, if you enjoy spending half an hour looking at the same thing thinking to yourself ""I don't know what to do..."", if you want to relax with a calm, quiet brain teaser accompanied by a faint sedate atmospheric audio, or if you just already played the first one and need another set of puzzles to work through, this is the game for you.

												Great sequel to an already great puzzler game. If you found the original Hexcells too hard, stop here because this sequel is a LOT more complex and harder. The original took me a little under 2 hours and wise nice and smooth to get into the system.This however is in another league, it took me almost 12 hours to complete. Of course you can always guess your way through it, but there's no fun in that. The brilliance of this game lies in the fact that all puzzles can be solved by simply using logical thinking. There's never any guess work needed. On the downside, since there's so many variables to keep track of, it sometimes takes prolonged staring at the screen to figure out what move is next.Which is also part of the greatness in the system. You sometimes have to hop from the left side to the right side of the puzzle or from bottom to top in order to make the next step. A nice change from doing things linear.Also the game comes with a new smoothing soundtrack, a bit calm spacy tunes with no lyrics. Keeps you very focused (at least it did for me) but it can get a bit dull when you're stuck for a longer period.All in all a worthy sequel, much much harder than the original but highly recommended if you're into logical problem solving or puzzles in general. If you dont want the spend too much get all three games in a package, or if you simple want to test out if this game is anything for you, start with the original.			"

												After playing and reviewing the original Hexcell, I realised it was the first game of a trilogy.I bought it and was pleased to see that my main complaints in Hexcell were fixed in the following games.(First Hexcell review here : http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068982092/recommended/265890/)Hexcell Plus is a Minesweeper-like, with hexagons instead of squares, line indicators, "" ? "" marks, etc... But the one thing that makes the Hexcell games shine is the level design! Unlike minesweeper, the levels are not random but designed. Because of this, you'll never encounter a case where you have to take a random choice and have 50% chances of winning. There will always be a path to the end of the level and we you get stuck, it's more both frustrating and motivating because you know there is a path to find.Hexcell Plus introduce some features that were not present in Hexcell and is a nice improvement on the difficulty. Hexcell was easy for me untill the end of the game but Hexcell Plus got harder sooner. I even had to replay some puzzles at least five times to get the perfection.If Hexcell was too easy for you but fun enough, this might be more entertaining. A fun minesweeper inspired puzzle of average difficulty!			"

												Hexcells plus is essentially the same as the previous one, with one key difference, as other people have mentioned: it's much more difficult.This comes with its advantages and its disadvantages. On the whole, though, I'm all for it!For those unfamiliar with the game, it's very similar to Sudoku, which more people are probably familiar with. The big difference is that you don't have the same structure in every game; instead, you get levels with vastly different layouts.There's never a need to ""guess"" or risk a move that might be wrong. If you combine the information at each turn, you'll find at least one correct move.Each moves reveals more information, which forms the game cycle.The first game was too easy. Why? Essentially, because you always had a group of valid moves at each turn. This meant that, even if you missed one or two, you could easily make significant progress. This time around, there's a new mechanic: '?' tiles. These don't reveal useful information.Many people have reacted negatively to this, but it's not as bad as it seems. I would even say it's necessary, to increase the difficulty.This way, you lose the number of valid moves, so you need to combine the more subtle information you get to reach the answer. With bigger levels, information is quite sparse, and you can get some really tricky puzzles.That's basically what Hexcells Plus does that its predecessor did not. The last game was fairly easy, while some of these puzzles can take you tens of minutes, if not an hour.Still, the game is still fair, giving you at least one valid move, if you're carefully looking for it!The biggest ""fault"" I find with this new tile is this: the previous game was surprisingly replayable! Since you always had several moves to make, you could choose very different paths to the solution. Each new path seemeed almost like a new level... which made a puzzle game replayable! That was great.This time, that doesn't happen (not to the same degree, anyway) simply because you have less options. Overall, this is just as great as the previous one! The mentioned disadvantage is undermined by the fact that it's more challeging, and thus brings something new into the formula.			"

 Hexcells Plus Hexcells is what I personally consider to be the second installment in the Hexcells series. While Hexcells is very good for the beginner, Hexcells plus will add another mechanic and roll on at a steeper pace. You are still given a beginner's level like that of Hexcells, but think of Hexcells Plus is the intermediate flavor of the three games.			"

												Gonna recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle games or brain teasers. :)Prior to the first Hexcells, this is much more challenging (or maybe I'm just not that smart), but still fun at the same time. I used less than 2.5 hours to finish the first one, while I used 13 hours for this one. (I did afk for more than 2 hours though.)I loved that I didn't have to read any walkthroughs nor ask anyone for tips or clues, nor guessing any of the answers. This is different than Minesweeper is that you won't have to guess, ever. You should be able to figure every single cell out without any mistakes. You can perfect the game easily, getting all the achievements and stuff too.			"

												The sequel to the original Hexcells game. Gameplay is still the same, so if you've played the first game you won't need any help getting started. Almost 8 hours of play time to perfect all the levels (this achievement is pretty forgiving, as it allows you to make one mistake on every level).Pros:*Easy to get started, especially if you played the first game*Still the interesting twist on the classical minesweeper gameCons:*Low replay value, only if after a while you've forgotten the levels will this be worth playing again.*No save function! I didn't miss this in the first game as most level were relatively short, however this sequel has several levels that had me wishing for an option to save my game so I could come back to it later.It's a good game if you like puzzles and brain teasers. Don't listen to the negative reviews telling you that these can't be solved by logic. Every single level can be solved with logical thinking! If you're a die-hard puzzle fan get this game, or the bundle of all three games (preferably on sale because of the low replay value). If not, but you'd still like to play- just get the Hexcells infinite game, as this game supports mid-level saving and has a random level generator for a lot more replay value.			"

												Effectively a solid standalone expansion pack of Hexcells itself, this was more satisfying than the original mainly because the tutorial section for each set of levels/type of clue you get to solve the puzzles is dealt with faster, so probably half of the 36 puzzles in this set are challenging (and a couple are downright fiendish in places until you know the answer).There is a slight risk for those less comfortable with this style of puzzle to get lost, but if you have already played through Hexcells it seems likely less hand holding this time round will be fine and just means you have more fun challenging levels to play through.

Quick Breakdown: A follow up to Hexcells, that feels like the next series of levels in the game, essentially it’s hard mode.Length: 8-10 hoursScore: 6.5/10Full Review: If you played the first Hexcells game, then you’ll already be familiar with the basic premise, and most of Hexcells plus mechanics, so I won’t go over them again. If you haven’t played the first Hexcells, then you should either play that before playing Hexcells Plus, or just play Hexcells Inifinte (the last part of this review will cover that more).What I will go over is what’s new and different to Hexcells Plus compared to the first game in the series. The short answer: not much. Hexcells Plus is basically the next series of levels after the final ones in the first Hexcells game. It does re-introduce the mechanics found in the first game, but its difficulty has a sharper spike, and it’s (thankfully) quite a bit more difficult to complete. It only has 10 more levels than the first game (making a total of 36 in Plus), it takes quite a bit longer to complete than the first did, Plus in more in the range of 8-10 hours, as opposed to the scant 2 of the firstNow, what’s new about Plus? Well, it introduces two new types of cells to the game. Vacant cells that have a question mark instead of a number in them, simply not indicating how many adjacent cells contain hexes. The other type is a blue hex that contains a number, indicating how many blue hexes are within a 2 cell radius. These two mechanics add a lot more difficulty to the game, and overall make it more enjoyable.That added difficulty spike is also why my two criticisms from the first game are even more noteworthy than before. Those being: 1). An option to save your progress mid-stage to resume later, something I once again get around by taking a screenshot to glance at when re-doing my progress if I need to stop playing before I can complete a stage. 2). A way to test out potential solutions without actually applying them yet (essentially like Picross’ overlay feature). This would be far more useful here than in the first game given the more complicated puzzles, and needing to look at how all the different numbers indicating hexes interact with each so that you can determine which cells have hexes and which do not.None-the-less, Hexcells Plus is still a fun puzzle game. If you’ve already played the first game, then this one serves as a fine continuation to it, offering what is essentially a hard mode. If you’ve not played any Hexcells games, then either pick up the complete pack when it’s on sale for under $3, or get just the third and final game Hexcells Infinite, as it offers a level generator, so it offers more gameplay, if you only want one.

												You shouldn't expect the same difficulty as the first Hexcells game, this game has the same mechanics but way and way more difficult. Since the first Hexcells looks more like a big tutorial instead of a full game, this one will throw you in the deep within a puzzle of 3. It took me 14 hours to complete the whole game perfectly, someone who is more experienced in puzzle games can probably complete it in a hour of 11. I bought the whole Hexcells pack in sale for below €3,- which was a great purchase and totally worth it, it's even worth the full price! If you are extremely low on money but love puzzle games, I recommend you to purchase the Hexcells infinite game. If you have a little more money, buy the whole Hexcells pack since the puzzles in Hexcells Plus will hold you busy for a while.+ Great Puzzle Experience+ Can be very challenging+ Simple to understand, hard to master+ Lots of different puzzle mechanics+ 60 Levels and ~12 hours of playing time+ Very cheap~ Can be a little frustrating sometimes- The puzzle doesn't save when you quitOverall, I give it a 8.5/10 for the great experience, challenging puzzles and cheap price.

												Zen in the art of Logic Puzzles. Hexcell Plus is a beautiful, ambient, relaxing - unless you are not a fan of logic puzzles that involve   deduction based around numbers (I mention it's based around numbers because there are people who love the type of logic puzzle that is based around text given clues, but brains are wired differently and excelling/loving one doesn't mean you excell/love the other. Brains, am I right?) - puzzle game.Just challenging enough, with a nice difficulty ramp as it introduces concepts and new gameplay mechanics. It's rather well done.  It's hard for me to find a straight puzzle game on the PC that I enjoy (Straight puzzle meaning the game has no ... Puzzle Agents is a puzzle game that is not SIMPLY a puzzle game, for instance. First counter example that popped into my head. There's probably better ones. But anyway. This game is just puzzles, no story or characters or whatever.)  -- But I haven't really found something that utilized the ambient atmosphere and logic as well as this, to my memory. On PC*. Not that there is anyhing wrong with the puzle game selection on PCs. I'm just picky.Anyway, highly recommended for fans of peaceful (or chaotic. You could always mute the games music and play Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, instead. Although...chaotic ambience can be peaceful...			"

												Nothing prepared me for what this game has done to me. I was looking for a puzzle game and came across Hexcell as one of Steam’s recommendations. “For two bucks and some change, I’ll give it a shot,” I thought. The game lulled me into relaxation by introducing concepts in easy to understand tutorials and basic puzzles. Then it added another layer of complexity, then another, and another. After finally completing one of the later puzzles without making any errors, I realized that I was not just playing a game. I was being trained on how to thing rationally and methodically using geometric and mathematical principles in ways that were light years beyond anything I had ever encountered before. At times, the game has taunted me, frustrated me, and even seemed to take a delight in watching me click on the wrong hex after getting three quarters through a map. Yet, I always go back for more. My cheap, cute, and spontaneous purchase has become an addiction. There is no other word for it. I have had to uninstall this game so that I would not be tempted by its siren call.If you are looking for an excellent puzzle game, you need not search any more.  "

												Hexcells and Hexcells Plus are both excellent games.  They introduce a fresh pure puzzle scenario not unlike an extra dimensional minesweeper.  Meditative music and chimes set the blissful mood for critical thinking, using deductive reasoning to solve puzzles subsequently in fashion.  Quite nice and worth the value.Note that Hexcells and Hexcells Plus are different games---neither share puzzles; however, the former has less content, less challenge and one less rule.  I obviously recommend both, but Hexcells Plus is of course superior for those reasons.			"

												I love all of the Hexcells games. They make me feel like I'm a genius and an idiot simultaneously. Hexcells (the original) was pretty easy to complete, but Hexcells Plus is much more challenging. Great puzzles that have a definite solution, so no guesswork should be involved, but sometimes you can stare at a puzzle for 30 minutes before seeing what you're supposed to do. And then once you figure it out you feel like the smartest person in the world. :D  Love this game!			"

												I love the multidirectionality of Hexcells Plus: solving a single cell can affect three lines of cells, as well as the set of surrounding cells. At first, it felt much like a hexagonal version of Minesweeper. When the lines were added, I was reminded of nonograms / paint-by-numbers puzzles. Then, as the puzzles continued, my mind became so occupied with the intersecting logic that I stopped trying to compare it to other games at all. The level design is excellent, and the puzzle progression slowly encourages you to learn new solving techniques, with no huge jumps in difficulty.Beware, though: Hexcells Plus doesn't save level progress. If you accidentally quit a level, you'll have to start over from the beginning.			"

												The game doesn't build on the originals mechanics, but instead offers much more challenging content that will last longer than the previous experience. That is the only difference really, but for anyone that played the first and are hungry for more (and that would probably be most of you), this will certainly satisfy. PROS:more of the same, but harder. Cons:nothing new, but no real complaints. 8/10(Just a note: Although the ambient music is amazing, I usually enjoy hexcells while listening to a music album in full, emotionally Im invested in the music while cereberally I am focussed on hexcells. It's a great zen-like ballance)			"

												This is the second installment in the Hexcells trilogy.  Whereas the first game might have a valid complaint of being a bit too quick and easy to complete(I acquired all acheivements in about 3 hours), it helps set up the foundation of game 2, in which the difficulty curves up must faster.  This game also continues to add a few new rules to change up the gameplay and increase the difficulty.This game is for you if you enjoy a mixture of minesweeper and logic problems, especially if you are wanting a somewhat greater challenge over the first game. For it's price(especially if you wait on a steam sale), it's great content.My one complaint is with the higher challenge comes longer solve time, but no saving during the puzzle.  It can make it frustrating if you spent 20-45 minutes on one you thought was really difficult, but you cannot quit unless you are willing to start from scratch.  it is a minor issue, but one that definitely added to the tougher levels.

The new mechanics work well, posing an additional challenge and increasing the difficulty to a satisfactory degree.  Hexcells Plus scratches the itch for more puzzles.This game can be described as a combination of Sudoku and Minesweeper with a visually pleasing aesthetic and soothing music. There is not much content (see the playtimes on record for other reviewers), but for the price it is definitely worth it if you like puzzle games. Will definitely continue to play as long as new content keeps being released (see Hexcells Plus, Hexcells Infinite).			"

												My two complaints about Hexcells was it's length--it was waaaay too short--and the lack of 2nd and 3rd order deductions.Yeah, so I really couldn't complain as I stared at a puzzle for 35 minutes trying to figre out where the sure click was...yeah, complaint withdrawn.  Mr. Brown, excellent job.This is, as far as I'm concerned, a perfect logic puzzle game.  The graphics are clean.  The rules get explained once and you're on your own with the elements.  There are a few more hint types.  They won't get introduced all at the same time, but by the last two sets of worlds you're on your own and the puzzles are not easy.  However, every puzzle has a logical solution.  You do not need to guess at anytime.  If you figure out the logic they will build on those methods.  If you randomly guess you can win and derive zero enjoyment from the game--or, you can be the wacko like me, who every time I made a mistake I restarted.  I was determined to figure it all out and I did--but there were some puzzles that took me a few hours to get through--and then I'd see the new method I was supposed to use, or the set of clues I overlooked and then the puzzle would get solved in another 10 minutes.If you like logic puzzles, this game is for you.  The first one, maybe not at full price, but it will serve as a proper introduction to it's very worthy successor, Hexcells Plus.			"

I loved the first one but felt it was a bit short, so I was pleased when this sequel upped the puzzle difficulty.  It has the same number of puzzles, but they took longer and required more thinking to get correctly.  It feels like it picks up where the last game left off, rather than just starting over from the start again.My only complaint is I would like the ability to quit a puzzle and come back to it with my current selections saved.

												Firstly, The title can be a little miss leading so I want to confirm to anybody that is interested in this game that this is a standalone game seaqual and not a DLC of the original game  Hexcell.Hexcells Plus is very similair to its predessor. In this version of the game there are additional ways you can work out the puzzles.It is very similar to the Mine swiper game you find in any version of Windows, but with a little twist. The idea of the puzzles is very simple. I found this version of the game a bit harder than the orginal game. Also I believe that there are more situations whereby you need to make a outright guess. This spoils the michanic of the game a little.Like the orginal game, it does get fustrating in the last couple of stages were the puzzles get bigger. Specially if you are after the achivements.The graphics are simple and styled well for this game.The music and sound is very good and compliments the game well. However after long play it does get a little repetative and you may want to switch the music off.I do recommend this game however again just like the orginal game it does have a short playthrough value. I picked this little game up in a midweek madness deal.			"

												Highly recommend this game. The levels are designed in such a way that you never have to guess; what makes it better is that there are usually multiple avenues towards solving each given level. If you're finding it too difficult to solve one area of (solvable, but tricky) hexes, it's often the case that you can make progress in a separate area before returning with a little more information. I would have liked to see some more content, but it was cool how the game kept with the hexagon theme. 6 worlds with 6 levels each. (Though admittedly, a few of the levels were filler / instructional, and didn't pose as much of a challenge.) I wonder if an optional timed mode would be a good idea. On the one hand, it would be nice to come back to the levels in a few months and see how fast I solve them second time around, but on the other hand, the pressure might take away from the uncluttered minimalist feel of the game. Overall, thorougly enjoyed Hexcells & Hexcells Plus and would definitely recommend as a stimulating challenge.			"

Quick Breakdown: A follow up to Hexcells, that feels like the next series of levels in the game, essentially it’s hard mode.Length: 8-10 hoursScore: 6.5/10Full Review: If you played the first Hexcells game, then you’ll already be familiar with the basic premise, and most of Hexcells plus mechanics, so I won’t go over them again. If you haven’t played the first Hexcells, then you should either play that before playing Hexcells Plus, or just play Hexcells Inifinte (the last part of this review will cover that more).What I will go over is what’s new and different to Hexcells Plus compared to the first game in the series. The short answer: not much. Hexcells Plus is basically the next series of levels after the final ones in the first Hexcells game. It does re-introduce the mechanics found in the first game, but its difficulty has a sharper spike, and it’s (thankfully) quite a bit more difficult to complete. It only has 10 more levels than the first game (making a total of 36 in Plus), it takes quite a bit longer to complete than the first did, Plus in more in the range of 8-10 hours, as opposed to the scant 2 of the firstNow, what’s new about Plus? Well, it introduces two new types of cells to the game. Vacant cells that have a question mark instead of a number in them, simply not indicating how many adjacent cells contain hexes. The other type is a blue hex that contains a number, indicating how many blue hexes are within a 2 cell radius. These two mechanics add a lot more difficulty to the game, and overall make it more enjoyable.That added difficulty spike is also why my two criticisms from the first game are even more noteworthy than before. Those being: 1). An option to save your progress mid-stage to resume later, something I once again get around by taking a screenshot to glance at when re-doing my progress if I need to stop playing before I can complete a stage. 2). A way to test out potential solutions without actually applying them yet (essentially like Picross’ overlay feature). This would be far more useful here than in the first game given the more complicated puzzles, and needing to look at how all the different numbers indicating hexes interact with each so that you can determine which cells have hexes and which do not.None-the-less, Hexcells Plus is still a fun puzzle game. If you’ve already played the first game, then this one serves as a fine continuation to it, offering what is essentially a hard mode. If you’ve not played any Hexcells games, then either pick up the complete pack when it’s on sale for under $3, or get just the third and final game Hexcells Infinite, as it offers a level generator, so it offers more gameplay, if you only want one.

												Summary: 7/10 - get it on saleA great sequel. Much harder than the original Hexcells.Hexcells is a game much like Minesweeper, except with more rules and more lateral thinking required. It's much more challenging than Minesweeper.Pros: Tons of challenge Relaxing musicCons: The game is quite short. If there were daily puzzles like some other puzzle games I could list, it would help this greatly. (nit-pick) Minesweeper is right-click to mark, left-click to dig. This game is the reverse by default, but you can configure it. Obvious tablet port. "

												This is mostly just a level pack for Hexcells. The original game's puzzles were easy, and these ones are more challenging. Experienced logic puzzle players may want to start here, while those who don't play much logic puzzles should start with the original.There is a new mechanic introduced, blue cells that have a number, but it's not too big a change to how the game plays.

												Great sequel to an already great puzzler game. If you found the original Hexcells too hard, stop here because this sequel is a LOT more complex and harder. The original took me a little under 2 hours and wise nice and smooth to get into the system.This however is in another league, it took me almost 12 hours to complete. Of course you can always guess your way through it, but there's no fun in that. The brilliance of this game lies in the fact that all puzzles can be solved by simply using logical thinking. There's never any guess work needed. On the downside, since there's so many variables to keep track of, it sometimes takes prolonged staring at the screen to figure out what move is next.Which is also part of the greatness in the system. You sometimes have to hop from the left side to the right side of the puzzle or from bottom to top in order to make the next step. A nice change from doing things linear.Also the game comes with a new smoothing soundtrack, a bit calm spacy tunes with no lyrics. Keeps you very focused (at least it did for me) but it can get a bit dull when you're stuck for a longer period.All in all a worthy sequel, much much harder than the original but highly recommended if you're into logical problem solving or puzzles in general. If you dont want the spend too much get all three games in a package, or if you simple want to test out if this game is anything for you, start with the original.			"

												Slightly harder than the original game, but still quite easy to finish without guessing. Becomes more oblique with having to remember what everything means, but at least numbers in blue hexes are more intuitive than different bracketed numbers. Still fun, similar soundtrack to the original (tolerable but ignorable) and generally addicitive, though with puzzles that require even more of a hunt to find the number you haven't completed yet (because there are more numbers to sort through).If you liked the first, get it, if you didn't don't bother. Start with the first game regardless as it will show you what all three games are about. They go on sale often enough, and the discount for getting all three isn't significant enough to not try one before getting the rest.			"

												For anyone not familiar with the original game, hexcells plays like a cross between minesweeper and sudoku. It is a well crafted little puzzle game with a range of challenging but beatable puzzles. I picked up Hexcells, Hexcells Plus and Hexcells infinite as a pack in the sale for around 3 Euros and I am extremely happy with the purchase. Hexcells took me around 2 and a half hours to fully complete, whereas Hexcells Plus raises the complexity of the puzzles and took me probably closer to seven hours (although I do like to take my time). Overall I would definitely recommend it if you like logic puzzles like Sudoku. "

												First Steam game I've been compelled to review. The craft and focus in this puzzle game is unmatched in my experience so far, except by a Tetris/Dr. Mario, perhaps. The way the rules of the game continue to build on each other is absorbing. The payoff when you can piece it all together, with the serenely soothing sounds and animation of receiving your perfect score -- it's satisifying in its quiet meditative reward.Of course this is the sequel to the original Hexcells, which is a sort of requirement, as this game continues the logic branches from the previous. The first set of puzzles in Hexcells Plus basically assume you've played the first.That game is definitely worth playing, but this is certainly the stronger of the two because of how in-depth a challenge it presents.If you like puzzles games, this is a must. If you don't, then at least play the original Hexcells on a friend's account if possible to give it a shot. Brilliant game.			"

												A definite jump in difficulty from regulars Hexcells, this game also plays like a combination of Minesweeper and Nonograms and introduce a new concept (2-Hexcell-range proximity indicators).  While every puzzle has a unique solution that you can deduce, you often have to consider upt to 3 or 4 facts at once in order to make progress. Its only downside (for me) is, that it has many big boards that take forever instead of challenging smaller ones. I recommend getting this in a bundle with Hexcells and Hexcells Infinite. The latter also got Steam cloud, generic puzzles  and you can finally save in between a puzzle instead of having to leave the game open.			"

Starts very much like minesweeper, but adds thing such as seeing the number of mines in a row/column, amount of mines within a radius of 2, and whether the mines are contiguous or not. It doesn't sound like it should be as enjoyable as it is, and I almost put myself to sleep while describing it, but it is very enjoyable and addictive. The downside is that when it's done, there's not much replayability. That said, I certainly got my fair share of enjoymenet out of it.			"

												This puzzle game is Minesweeper on steroids, and I strongly recommend it.It is basically Minesweeper in an hexagonal grid, where mines have been replaced by blue tiles/hexes and uncovered numbers tells you how many of those blue tiles are adjacent to them. Correctly uncover all tiles to finish the puzzle. But various other visual clues have been added to the mix, such as: digits telling you the number of blue hexes in a row or column (or diagonal); numbered blue hexes indicating the amount of other blue tiles in its vicinity; question marks hiding information from you; and other intersting hint systems that let you deduce the locations of blue tiles without resorting to luck.As far as I know, it is always possible to deduce the tile locations using the hints given. No more of these 50/50 chances that occur all to frequently at the end of a game of Minesweeper. And mistakes are allowed too, you can continue the puzzle even after clicking on a wrong tile. Though you need to keep mistakes at a minimum to unlock everything.The presentation is clean, simple and slick. Cool visual aids are provided that help you easily identify all the tiles of a row, or all the hexes in a 2-tile radius around a numbered blue hex. These are particularly useful in big and unusually shaped puzzles (unlike Minesweeper, the shape of the grid varies from puzzle to puzzle).The electro-ambient music is also very fitting for a game that requires your full concentration. Notes are played each time you click on a tile, merging beautifully with the ongoing music. It is a detail, but it certainly adds to the experience.All in all, if you like this kind of puzzle game, you cannot pass this up.			"

												Hexcells is my favourite puzzle game of its genre yet, and I've tried a few. It has an easy concept, with more rules thrown in as you progress. Be warned, just because it starts off easy doesnt mean this game is easy; the first Hexcells took me about 4 hours to complete - 26 hours into Hexcells Plus and I've got one level to go.  I love this game, it got me hooked for weeks. 26 hours for £2, my best investment for a game and my time so far.I wouldnt reccomend this game to everyone, however if you're a fan of minimalistic puzzles that actually require you to stare at the screen trying to logically piece everything together one step at a time, then this is a game for you.10/10 IMHO.

												A fun puzzle game. Although it feels repetitive after playing the first Hexcells, I can't seem to quit it. Very addictive if you enjoy puzzle games! If you're able to, I'd go for the bundle for Hexcells, since you'll want to play them all!			"

												Overall: GoodDifficulty: MediumComments:- The puzzles in Hexcells Infinite are more challenging and more tightly designed; it is a better game all around.  This game is still worthwhile, though.Likes:- Every puzzle can be solved without guessing- Can be fairly challenging- Relaxing- I enjoy deductive logic puzzlesDislikes:- The puzzles tend to be large, but not necessarily difficult.  For me, often the difficulty was less in actually solving the puzzles, and more in noticing the relevant clues.  This felt a bit tedious.- The puzzles often have more clues than strictly necessary, which makes it easier- For the clues that indicate blue cells within an area, it can be hard to see their coverage / edge- Does not save progress within puzzles- Does not support Steam Cloud to sync progress			"

												For anyone not familiar with the original game, hexcells plays like a cross between minesweeper and sudoku. It is a well crafted little puzzle game with a range of challenging but beatable puzzles. I picked up Hexcells, Hexcells Plus and Hexcells infinite as a pack in the sale for around 3 Euros and I am extremely happy with the purchase. Hexcells took me around 2 and a half hours to fully complete, whereas Hexcells Plus raises the complexity of the puzzles and took me probably closer to seven hours (although I do like to take my time). Overall I would definitely recommend it if you like logic puzzles like Sudoku. "

												If you've played Hexcells - and you should! - then you already know what this game is about: Minesweeper-like logic puzzles where you process out hexes that are occupied and those that are empty.  But if you've played Hexcells you are still only slightly ahead of the curve, as these puzzles are much more difficult and require much more attention and deduction than the predecessor.  The first Hexcells took me 3 hours to master all the levels (without a guide, natch) while Hexcells Plus has already taken more than that from me and I've only FINISHED 1/3 of the puzzles so far!  Granted that may say more about me than the game, but I think the general truth of the proposition holds.  A unique introduction is the ? hex, which can lead to a puzzle board dead end that can only be solved by looking off the board rather than on it; no numbered hexes to assist you, and only the beauty of logical deduction can remedy it.  As with the first Hexcells, you can always guess (ala Minesweeper's early game ""cheat"" method) but that frankly defeats the purpose of playing a logic puzzle game.  You can also refer to the Steam guides to solve overly difficult puzzles, but I would recommend doing neither; this game is immensely rewarding when you defeat a level using only your reasoning faculties and that is how it should be played.  Highly recommended (even though I haven't finished it yet!), and the best $3 game on Steam I've yet found.			"

												This review is written for Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells InfiniteHexagonal PuzzlerReviewed after completing all achievementsGameplayHexcells plays like an average 2d puzzle games, you click your mouse to solve the puzzles not hard.  Untill you get to the later puzzles that is.  This game has one of the most ingenious puzzle systems I've played to date.  It isn't so complex that you're left scratching your head at what the rules that these puzzles follow are, but it isn't so simple that it becomes boring after you've completied a few of them.I will say that while trying to %100 this game I looked up a few of the solutions after completing them once.  This is because this game has a 'perfect' rating, in which there must be no missclicks on a puzzle to actually complete it for the achievements.  And while I did mess up sometimes when solving these puzzles, most of the time these missclicks were due to me acidentally resting my fingers on my buttons while trying to solve a hard section, or right clicking when I should have left clicked that time damn it!GraphicsThis game has a great look to it, but playing it at night will strain your eyes due to the brightness of it.VerdictThis is a great game and well worth your time if you're looking for a puzzle game to play.  Though the achievement in Hexcells Infinite where you must complete some of the random puzzles just takes far too long. 8/10  "

												How to play Hexcells Plus? It's easy.All you need is to sit in a comfortable chair and start doing simple math. Counting, counting and counting.This is the very same review that I have posted about Hexcells.But if you really want to try this game now. Don't buy this version. Purchasing its sequel Hexcells Infinite is a way better decision. Because the later one has a puzzle generator that can give you tons of new puzzles to play.Link to Hexcells Infinite:This game is basically an alternative to Minesweeper. Changing the shape of hidden block from Square to Hexagon doesn't make this game any special. Both games give you very similar gameplay experience.However, Hexcells makes the game a lot easier by giving you a lot of hints. I didn't have any difficulty to finish this game very quick. So, I have to say that the game is not that challenging comparing with Minesweeper.But still is a decent game and deserve your attention.			"

This game will destroy your confidence in being able to count. Not only that, I find I can't do other activities shortly after, such as write a review or workout, because I tell myself it can only ""contain 3 hexes, so there has to be an empty space somewhere, and this is real life, there are no hexes, yea but you should watch out for the overall column's number you probably only got 1 hex left, just go to the gym, you turned the game off a half hour ago, why is the world still blue and orange?!""

												My main complaint with the original Hexcells was that it was fairly easy and only took me a couple of hours to complete. Hexcells Plus does not have that problem. In fact it has the opposite: it was harder than I could handle. I don't know if I was missing some logical step in figuring out the solutions, or if the game actually forces you to guess (I'm betting on the former) but there were quite a few levels that I ended up completing the first time with many mistakes. I only got all of the achievements through sheer memorization and repeating the harder levels multiple times in a row. Even so, I am looking forward to getting Hexcells Infinite and trying out the procedurally generated levels.Reasonable price: $4.			"

												Nothing prepared me for what this game has done to me. I was looking for a puzzle game and came across Hexcell as one of Steam’s recommendations. “For two bucks and some change, I’ll give it a shot,” I thought. The game lulled me into relaxation by introducing concepts in easy to understand tutorials and basic puzzles. Then it added another layer of complexity, then another, and another. After finally completing one of the later puzzles without making any errors, I realized that I was not just playing a game. I was being trained on how to thing rationally and methodically using geometric and mathematical principles in ways that were light years beyond anything I had ever encountered before. At times, the game has taunted me, frustrated me, and even seemed to take a delight in watching me click on the wrong hex after getting three quarters through a map. Yet, I always go back for more. My cheap, cute, and spontaneous purchase has become an addiction. There is no other word for it. I have had to uninstall this game so that I would not be tempted by its siren call.If you are looking for an excellent puzzle game, you need not search any more.  "

												Now, compared to the first Hexcells game, this is something worth buying. A much steeper learning curve and harder levels mean that 100%-ing Hexcells Plus is no longer something you can do in one, two-hour-long seating. If Hexcells was the tutorial or the demo, Hexcells Plus is an actual game. As of writing this review, I still have 5 puzzles to do perfectly, and I've already played almost 3 times as long as it took me to 100% the first game.As for what the game is - it's the same as the previous one: a brilliant, addictive fusion of Minesweeper and Picross. This time around, the interactive soundtrack is more rigid - sounds play according to the rythm of the ambient background music as opposed to the rythm of your own clicks.Overall, a good puzzle game that's worth the price, especially if you grab the Hexcells Complete Bundle during a sale.

												Much more difficult than the original, particularly if you are going for an error-free game. There are more hexes and more mechanics, so you are going to mis-click just by crossing wires. The increased difficulty is usually for the better, but sometimes the levels are just unnecessarily long, complicated, or tossing together mechanics so you need to pause and remember what each symbol means, because they are ALL on the board.Level 5-3 is a great example of where the game shines, elegantly using the mechanics. I think I enjoyed the first one more with its elegance and for the consistency of not having ? hexes, although the increased difficulty is appreciated.			"

												The second part in the Hexcells series expands and improves on the rather lackluster first part. A new mechanic is introduced and in general the levels are much more challenging and demanding. As a seasoned player of logic puzzels this game took me around 10 hours to complete and brought me much more enjoyment than the way too easy first part of the series. Sadly there still is little replayability (this is only fixed in the third installment). My only real gripe is that far too often this game derives its difficulty from a bigger quantity rather than a better quality. Most of the later levels are huge and the challenge becomes less figuring out logic puzzles than it is spotting the one tile bottleneck that lets you continue. Still each level typically has an area that is very interesting and makes you feel really satisfied after figuring it out. The absolute high point of this game were the three small levels providing tough nuts to crack with little distraction.Design and UI are the same as the first installment. The soundscape created is still interesting but I had to mute the game an hour in because it started to become grinding. During some of the larger levels a save functionality would have been nice to have. I've never encountered a bug, error or crash.If you like challenging logic puzzles this might be worth full price to you. I can wholeheartedly recommend picking this up as part of the trilogy compilation or at a discounted price.			"

												First Steam game I've been compelled to review. The craft and focus in this puzzle game is unmatched in my experience so far, except by a Tetris/Dr. Mario, perhaps. The way the rules of the game continue to build on each other is absorbing. The payoff when you can piece it all together, with the serenely soothing sounds and animation of receiving your perfect score -- it's satisifying in its quiet meditative reward.Of course this is the sequel to the original Hexcells, which is a sort of requirement, as this game continues the logic branches from the previous. The first set of puzzles in Hexcells Plus basically assume you've played the first.That game is definitely worth playing, but this is certainly the stronger of the two because of how in-depth a challenge it presents.If you like puzzles games, this is a must. If you don't, then at least play the original Hexcells on a friend's account if possible to give it a shot. Brilliant game.			"

												A fun puzzle game. Although it feels repetitive after playing the first Hexcells, I can't seem to quit it. Very addictive if you enjoy puzzle games! If you're able to, I'd go for the bundle for Hexcells, since you'll want to play them all!			"

												Simple, satisfying, and addictive. Starts very much like minesweeper, but adds thing such as seeing the number of mines in a row/column, amount of mines within a radius of 2, and whether the mines are contiguous or not. It doesn't sound like it should be as enjoyable as it is, and I almost put myself to sleep while describing it, but it is very enjoyable and addictive. The downside is that when it's done, there's not much replayability. That said, I certainly got my fair share of enjoymenet out of it.			"

												Slightly harder than the original game, but still quite easy to finish without guessing. Becomes more oblique with having to remember what everything means, but at least numbers in blue hexes are more intuitive than different bracketed numbers. Still fun, similar soundtrack to the original (tolerable but ignorable) and generally addicitive, though with puzzles that require even more of a hunt to find the number you haven't completed yet (because there are more numbers to sort through).If you liked the first, get it, if you didn't don't bother. Start with the first game regardless as it will show you what all three games are about. They go on sale often enough, and the discount for getting all three isn't significant enough to not try one before getting the rest.			"

												Overall: GoodDifficulty: MediumComments:- The puzzles in Hexcells Infinite are more challenging and more tightly designed; it is a better game all around.  This game is still worthwhile, though.Likes:- Every puzzle can be solved without guessing- Can be fairly challenging- Relaxing- I enjoy deductive logic puzzlesDislikes:- The puzzles tend to be large, but not necessarily difficult.  For me, often the difficulty was less in actually solving the puzzles, and more in noticing the relevant clues.  This felt a bit tedious.- The puzzles often have more clues than strictly necessary, which makes it easier- For the clues that indicate blue cells within an area, it can be hard to see their coverage / edge- Does not save progress within puzzles- Does not support Steam Cloud to sync progress			"

Challenging, entertaining, engaging, and a little relaxing. Wrong.This game is HELL. Please play it if you like staring angrily at the same puzzle for a half hour at a time. I lost many evenings to this game. I don't know if I regret it or if I want more. ...I think I want more.			"

												This game is a nice mix of sudoku and minesweeper. The puzzles get increasingly harder as you progress through the game and it is very satisfying when you perfect at level quickly. I highly recommend all of the Hexcells games, but if you are to buy only one get Hexcells Infinite. That one adds some mechanics on top of the ones presented in this game, and best of all includes a random puzzle generator for when you complete the game for added hours of fun.			"

												I like Hexcells and the Plus challenge is certainly a move in the right direction. Some smaller problems, however, do not allow me to recommend this version of Hexcells. Currently, there is no way how to save your progress in a given puzzle which becomes a real pain in the later worlds. Either you spend a lot of time working on a single puzzle or you rush it and make useless mistakes (or have a permanently running game in the background).CZ: Hexcells je skvělá hra, ale tuto verzi nemohu doporučit. Zejména kvůli tomu, že nemá možnost uložit pokrok v řešení a tedy musíte řešit velké závěrečné hlavolamy najednou.			"

												A fantastic followup to Hexcells, itself a game that I really enjoyed.  This game was only slightly larger in scope in that there were 6 worlds as opposed to Hexcells' 5.  There also was not a lot of addition to the ruleset established by Hexcells.  However, neither of these are particularly negative points, given the polish of the original game.  The additions to the ruleset are well thought out and add another dimension to the game.The set of puzzles in this game are particularly fiendish, but all can be solved without guessing, although sometimes it might be tricky to spot which part of the puzzle you have unlocked.  I played to get the Perfectionist achievement, which meant plenty of restarts of tricky puzzles.  I thoroughly enjoyed it though, even with the frustrations of being most of the way through a tough map and then making the wrong call!I would wholeheartedly recommend this game, and look forward to getting stuck into the next game!

												You might be wondering if Hexcells Plus is worth getting if you've played the original Hexcells and found it a bit short - it is. It took me about 6x as long, in fact.The original almost feels like a demo compared to this one; it doesn't reach the full potential of Hexcells, in my opinion. So, you're really doing yourself and the game a disservice by not getting Plus.			"

												A happy medium between the original Hexcells and Hexcells Infinite. There are a handful of mind-benders but the majority of the puzzles can be done in a reasonable amount of time if you understand the logic of the game.The only con is that the game doesn't save your puzzle progress. If you're trying to get the Perfection achievement a few of the puzzles can take quite a while and not being able to stop and return later is frustrating. If this is something you're concerned about start with Hexcells Infinite which does save progress.			"

												Updates to my previous review:Only get this game when you finished the first game. If you got this game via bundle and missout the first game. go buy that one first. This one is much harder than the precedesor.Look like ? block is there to make the game a lot more chalenging. When got stuck, don't forget to look around for some clue. Especially those number at the corners. Random guess is maybe ok for quick start into the level, just like Minesweeper..... Sometimes using the intended way is a bit too time consuming, but don't use it too often. This game punishs any mistake real hard.I'm now more upset when I made mistake because of one single click that would force me to restart. (On my 2nd play for perfectionist achievement). With this extra amount of logic in this game, I seriously wish there is a third button for flag (somewhat like minesweeper).......-------Old review:First game is far better than this game because it doesn't contain ? blog that involves too many random guessing.

												This is a fun, challenging variation of minesweeper, which uses a hex grid and many different styles of clues.  Compared to the first game in the series, this game is far more challenging.  While I breezed through the first game in about 3 hours, I haven't finished this one as of 13 hours in.  The number of puzzles is only slightly greater than in the first game, but the challenge means each one takes much longer.The only downside is that sometimes puzzles almost require a couple guesses to solve.

												Start with Minesweeper, remove the guessing: this is Hexcell. This is a brilliant puzzle/logic game. The hand crafted levels are beautiful, and will challenge you for a few hours. If you want more, Hexcell infinite introduces a puzzle generator. Computer generated levels are less interesting than hand-crafted one, but still a welcome addition to this 3rd episode of the hexcell franchise.			"

												So I played all the Hexcells games and this is the second of the series.Let me tell you something right away, if you expect this game to be exactly like the first Hexcell, IT IS NOT.This game is harder and challenging by introducing new elements.One of them is the ""?"" spaces where it removes the number around the blank spaces which forces you to look at other details for information.ALL PUZZLES IN THIS GAME CAN BE COMPLETED WITHOUT GUESSING AND JUST PURE LOGIC.Every other review that states you need to guess to progress are terribly wrong.You need to check other information such as how many blue space remind for example.IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME, I LARGELY RECOMMEND CHECKING THE 100% NO MISTAKE GUIDE AS IT EXPLAINS HOW TO SOLVE EVERY PUZZLE LOGICALLY! I use it to check on cases where I am just stuck, hard, and see if there was something I missed and I missed a lot of stuff. (I also suck at counting...)Anyway, I would recommend this game if you want a challenge but do not get it if you wanted the same game as the previous version. The puzzle's pacing is long because of it.PS. Hexcells Infinite added a save feature which I wish it added in this one...			"
