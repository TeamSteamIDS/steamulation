												This game is basically a standalone expansion to Revolution.  It's a much better game overall, and the workshop support is very cool, but you can't help but feel like a lot of this should have been in Revolution to begin with.The problem with the game though, is that even though it's better than both Revolution and Reloaded, it's still a shadow of a game compared to Armageddon.  Sure, it has the same number of weapons and even lets you use the Armageddon HUD for your weapons, but that's really the only areas where it matches that old classic, and even then it replaces fun weapons from that game (such as the bow) with newer weapons that, honestly, just aren't as fun.The graphics are decent, but you will have stutter and FPS drops even on decent rigs when you play games with a lot of onscreen objects/worms.  They've said for some time now they have been working on the FPS issues, but the fact I have not heard anything in a while combined with the fact that one update actually made my performance *worse*, doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.  Also, the game does not have an FPS cap on background objects, but the foreground objects are all animated at 30FPS.  It's incredibly awkward looking and makes it blatantly obvious the game was made using an engine designed for consoles, not exactly the grand ""PC exclusive"" we were promised.Even looking past that, it's just painfully obvious that you cannot have a game like this in 2.5D if you play for even just a decent amount.  You can't always tell just what it is you can actually stand on, not to mention if a chunk of landscape is small enough, you can't even see it at all (I even have proof of this in my screenshots for this game).  We do not gain a single thing going to 3D graphics, we only lose precision and performance.  Team 17, please stop trying to make Worms in 3D graphics.  If you want to do that, make another 3D Worms (and make a decent 3D camera while you're at it), because it's not like 2D graphics is some kind of forbidden thing to have in a video game these days.Admittedly, all the new weapons and tools do serve their purpose and can be useful at times (to be honest, this is the first time in a Worms game I actually *like* using the mortar), but they range from fun to boring.  And frankly, one weapon isn't even new, the Bovine Blitz was already in Ultimate Mayhem, yet they act as if it is new (maybe to 2D Worms, but they should specify that instead of just saying it's new).  And everyone who cried that the rope is overpowered in Armageddon?  The water jetpack is far, far more unbalanced than the rope ever was (and the rope wasn't OP to begin with...but the aqua pack sure is).  To be fair though, the winged monkey is a very useful tool for stopping darksiders, and it's amusing to block someone between two physics objects and then go blast them out (""Oh, are you stuck?  Here, let me help you...heh heh heh"").As for the teleport gun being the compromise to the rope no longer allowing Armageddon levels of speed?  It's not a compromise at all, it's incredibly easy to use and has no real skill ceiling to it.  It's like whoever was in charge had no idea what it was about the rope that made it so fun to use.  Had it been developed with the mindset that you need to do a lot of practice to master it, it could have been something really cool, but it's a big disappointment if you're an old roper.  Team 17 needs to stop being so pigheaded about the rope and just revert it to the way it was before, because I just don't see how anyone could think the new rope or the teleport gun are more fun, even after having spent hours using both.But let's say you can ignore all that, and are willing to play anyways.  What's that you say?  You want to play Hysteria?  Not possible because you can't fine tune the turn timer in this.  Bow and Arrow?  Haha, sorry, there is no bow in this.  Shopper?  You'll get bored when you realize the limitations of the rope.  Heck, you can't even really get crazy with something original, because...and this alone is *THE BIGGEST PROBLEM* with the game, and the series since Reloaded in my opinion...Team 17 keeps removing gameplay options with which to customize schemes.  We don't exactly gain anything worthwhile in their place either.  Frankly, the only reason this is better than Reloaded is because Reloaded's physics were just that bad, Reloaded has far more options than Clan Wars, and that game is only a few years old.I don't recommend any of the newer Worms games at all.  Not because I'm a die hard Armageddon fan (I actually preferred Hedgewars, back when it was more active), but because these games are cash grabs that have obvious signs of Team 17 just flat out being lazy, all while promising they are listening to the community and that this game will be ""the best Worms yet"".Heck, they barely acknowledge the old Armageddon fans, and make it pretty obvious they are not listening to their input on these games.  So...they want to build a game with an active community, yet all but shun the oldest fans unless they are willing to lavish praise on their half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sequels?  And yet they wonder why the series has been losing fans.  They also tend to delete negative topics on their forums (even banning users for telling people how to get refunds on the Revolution board...myself included), and I wouldn't be surprised if this review gets flagged by them.So why did I buy this?  Because I'm still a fan of Worms.  And it was cheap with a discount and trading card money.  But Team 17's rotten attitude and laziness make it extremely hard to like the new games.  I seriously doubt I'd ever buy any of their future games, Worms or not.  Not until they stop being all talk and actually make a game designed for people who don't just play casually (as casuals are less likely to notice a lack of depth or laziness on the developer's part).TL;DR version: Another half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Worms game from Team 17.  One I wanted to like but I just can't.  Avoid unless you have to have every single Worms game ever, and even then, get it for at least 75% off, as $25 is nothing short of overpriced for this game, especially considering Armageddon is $15 on steam and will last you far longer.

												Lets just say maybe you don't have a clue what ""Worms"" is. I think this is HIGHLY unlikely, and certainly embarrassing for you if that is true in anyway possible. The Worms of a decade ago is much the same as the Worms of today, with newer titles adding a few spins and twists on the classic formula but generally sticking to what made it work all these years to go Basically its just all the lovely new features from Worms Revolution have been retained by its wriggling, younger sibling: classes, water, and physics. Combatants are split up into soldiers, scouts, scientists, and heavies, all with different movement speeds, health, and special abilities, like the scientist worm's knack for healing his chums. They've been tweaked and balanced since Revolution, with area of effects for special abilities being added or increased.What makes Clan Wars above its predecessors is the effort that has been put into multiplayer. There's local multiplayer, then your standard online PvP, but the truly special, properly new addition is the titular clan feature. With the same tools used to make a team of deadly, slimy worm-warriors, you can put together a whole clan, with a distinct appearance along with a shiny emblem and a clan name, and then recruit members to this clan, not that it matters at all since the pvp on this title is most likely dead or with 1-10 players.Ultimately, its success lies in its ability to maintain a healthy population, which certainly won't happen if Team 17 keep churning out more Worm titles, so one hopes that they will take a breather. If Revolution was the best that Worms had ever been then this definently is a title worth having.			"

												Great addition to the Worms collection. Expands on Worms Revolution while adding a host of both new and old weapons. They even bring back some of the classics like the Morter, and Scales of Justice, only with a twist to them this time around.Only issue I have, is an issue that I also had with Worms Revolution, and seems to pertain only to a fraction of PC's, where lag occures, often causing jumps to be unreliable (and unsafe!). Overall though, this one still gets 5/5 from me so far (about 23 hours of playtime).			"

												Worms Clan Wars was gotten me more friends than any game I've ever played. I've never had so much fun practising one technique until its perfect. You learn something every worms game and when you see something amazing you just want to try it, 100s of times. I may of played more revolution but clan wars is so much better (but roping got harder). Anyway, This game is so much fun, worth buying, especially with friends			"

I don't use the online play of this game a lot i only play with friends but i think it's a bit bugged.So if you want to have a good time playing a game with your friends i would definitely recommend this game.

												Nothing short of lazy cash grab, compared to Revolutions takes few steps forward and many steps backwards.+ Still has Local vs mode+ New themes & layouts look nice+ Different classes have distinct benefits and drawbacks- Runs very sluggish (Revolutions runs much smoother on same rig)- Too many easy to use weapons & gadgets (I suppose it's a good thing if you want to play this casually)- Scientist worm + Magnet = practically immune to anything that's not long ranged weapon FOR REST OF THE MATCH- bad matchmaking system, finding other players is very bothersome and time consuming- bad netcode, I've seen more DC's (both mine and other players) on this game than any other multiplayer game-- Team 17 can't handle ANY critique. No seriously, try posting ANY FORM of complaint to Steam forums and see how long it takes until Team 17 removes your post.Verdict: Avoid like plague, spend your money elsewhere.			"

												I have always had a soft spot for the Worm's series, which it's crazy physics, bazookas, dynamite, super sheep and holy hand grenades and this game hasn't changed that opinion one bit. I took advantage of the package deal and got this Worms game along with several others. Note this is a first impression review.Worms Clan Wars is an 2.5D artillery game where you control teams of Worms to defeat the other teams. You use a wide selection of weaponry and tools to secure victory. Sometimes in hilarious ways. Gameplay wise this is no Armaggedon but it comes close.Even when you lose or do something daft you can always laugh about it. In one case, I was going to do a classic tactic of using a baseball bat to send an enemy worm into the water, only instead for the worm to catch onto a piece of landscape, I was still laughing afterwards.Unlike most Worms games including Armaggedon, you have several classes of Worms to use. The Soldier is basically the standard Worm, but gains the ability to detonate grenades at any time. The Scout is a weaker, but faster Worm that doesn't set of mines. The Heavy is a slow, but tough worm that does extra damage. The Scientist is similar to the Solider but can heal itself and its teammate each turn whilst producing better tools. You can configure your team to adapt to this.Online Gameplay is fun, and even when something daft happens you can still enjoy it and the clan features are nice.The only criticism I have is the modded in cosemtic options, which with some items like that Master Chief helmet can really cause the lag in an online game to go theough the roof and with a rather low spec computer it has firced me to quit several times.Definately recommend giving this game a shot!

												I got the four pack with some suitemates in my dorm and might I say this was well worth the 4-odd dollars I had to pay per copy. Among the four of us we had collectively broken 100 hours within the first two weeks.DOWNSIDE: If you can't find friends to play, it can be hard to find a match with more than one opponent. Not enough Clans play and I feel people are really missing out.UPSIDE:This game series is and always fun, and this game is no different.Clan Wars uses four different characters with different movement speeds and damage outputs, and you can have any combination you want... keeping things interesting.There's always new workshop content such as soundboards, worm outfits, and maps.Playing with friends is hilarious, especially when that one friend you have that is terrible at these games keeps accidentally committing suicide while parachuting or jetpacking. Alliances will be made, betrayed, and winning is always a curse.Half 3D maps are visually satisfying and destruction is... a ""blast""Dynamic water/Good weapon choice/physics objectsNot strenuous on your pcOverall, it's a great game and made better with friends.I've even considered buying extra copies to get more people playing, but my wallet disagrees...Get it!

												[UPDATED]Clan Wars is as same as Revolution, but it's better version - Steam Workshop, better customisation, more weapons, amusing Story mode, Worm Ops, Clan Wars mode... But this is not a game without its drawbacks. First one, the online seems is empty of lobbys. Second, A.I. is a laughter in the courtroom (I mean - they're snipers or ""moles"") There are only five worlds (even I was hoping about the worlds from Revolution), but this doesn't change fact this game is medicore. Playing with friends (both online and locally) should be good, but playing solo after hour can just get bored. Overall, this is a game that makes me pleasure.Pros: It's a Worms game; Lots of humor; Steam Workshop; Clan Wars mode; Class abilities; sometimes makes me fun...Cons:...sometimes bores me; Almost empty Multiplayer; so-so AI; only five worlds?!; weak optimization; (unnecessarily, but) where's the smoke?!Rate: 8,5/10 "

												Bugged, hardly any online community and lack of support from Team17 but still great fun.If you want a tactical turn based and very silly game this is well worth looking in to when offers pop up from time to time on Steam. However, the game is branded ""Clan Wars"" but the online play (and lobby system for finding matches) is bugged. The offline game is short and not much of a challenge but does teach some techniques useful for online play.One nice feature of this game is that beginners in 3-way and 4-way games often have a chance to win and should never give in! Players tend to pick on the biggest threat (most health left/experience/skill) and this means someone with a basic knowledge can challenge to win.If the numerous bugs were fixed and more people played online  the game would live up to it's name and provide fun clan wars..

But I honestly still couldn't recommend this product. In my opinion it can be quite fun playing with friends (if you manage to persuade them to buy it). But the fun doesn't last very long and soon you start to get sick and bored of the game. Take my advice and take the time to find a game that looks more fun, better and generally will still be fun after 6 hours.			"

												Great game for the Worms series! Its 3D but keeps the old worms 2D on the side style (making it a 2.5D game) and with new and old classic weapons to choose from, anyone whos played any of the Worms game is sure to enjoy this!Its got a nice little story mode that with each level shows you how the game plays that will help you beat some of the harder levels, there is also Local CO-OP multiplayer mode with also online multiplayer which all seem to run great!You get to edit your teams, they have different types of worm such as heavy (take more damage then the average worm) scout (runs and jumps far but is small and weaker) scientist (gives 5hp each time its a scientist worm's turn to the whole team) and then the average worm which is a soilder class/rank each all play a part of winning the match and not just relying on luck and good shots. But thats not all, you get to chose their victory dance, their voice (soundbank) what they wear such as hats, glasses or facial hair and even selecting your type of fort for your team with plenty of options for each category.Steam Workshop is also supported for the game so there is heaps of content that you can add to your teams customization, you can add more content such as gravestones, hats, glasses, trinkets, mustaches, soundbanks and even levels!If your a fan of Worms from the 90s or weather you started when it first went 3D or even just thinking of trying one, Worms Clan Wars is def worth giving a go!

												Worms is in line with the previous games, a 2D team-based arcade arena, and their humour is par for the course, along with the weapons, stages, etc. Clan wars is a great little title to play with friends, the updated interface and 3D graphics are nicely done, customization is high, with mod support to boot, and I've gotten more than a couple laughs and good entertainment already. If you like dicking around with your friends with mayhem and well placed mechanics and overall gameplay, this works great. I'm not sure about solo, or the full price point at the moment, but I'd say worth a sale price.			"

												Clan Wars is probably the most innovative Worms game to date offering the same diversity of classes as Revolution albeit with some tweaks for balancing.In case you're not familiar with them:  Soldiers are the same regular worms from all other games except they can choose when to detonate grenades.  Heavies have the most damage and biggest explosions but are slower and (obviously) heavier.  Scouts are more mobile with longer jumps and are light enough to avoid triggering mines but deal less damage. Scientists heal friendly worms in a small radius at the start of their turn and all constructions (girders, turrets, magnets, etc.) are more durable but they also deal reduced damage.Weapons variety is largely the same as in Revolution from the traditional bazooka to some of the more wacky ones, many of which have multiple uses, like the Lightning Strike allowing you to heal worms, resurrect dead ones, convert turrets and activate inactive mines and magnets. Unlike classic Worms and Armageddon the Ninja Rope functions more like a rope than a mix between a rope and a ladder, meaning you'll weigh it down and have to use your momentum to swing around. Other mobility items, both old and new to the genre, include such items as Jetpack, Water Jetpack and Teleport Gun to name but a few.As far as gameplay goes Clan Wars is an optimized Revolution meaning no lag when water sloshes about. However, both games are made in the same engine which limits animations to 30 frames per second regardless of what fps the actual game runs on. Note the game itself can run above 30 fps; only the worm animations are limited.So all in all I think it's one of the freshest Worms games out there since Armageddon.			"

												If you remember playing Worms years ago and thought that this is the new improved version with much better graphics and much more features you might be disappointed. It is rather fine but the weird multiplayer lobby makes it hard to get any opponents online unless you friend people who frequently play multiplayer matches.The graphics are somewhat hideous, with blobs imitating water and 3d-ish models that lokk outdated.The mechanics are so-so. The ninja rope is prone to blocking constantly, but other than that the combat is okay. Would I recommend this game? Yes, it's a fun part of the Worms series. There's a ton of weapons to choose from and a lot of customisation. The single player/tutorial part is rather short, but the story part long and fairly challenging.Is it what I was expecting of it? Not even close. 5/10			"

												This is a Worms game worth playing. I played a lot of Worms Armageddon and World Party back in the day and was pleasantly surprised with Clan Wars. I expected it to be among the ranks of Worms 3D and Forts but it's actually good! It's good enough that I play it most nights with my friends. The gameplay is satisfying, doesn't have many gimmicks (3D objects and dynamic water are implemented well) and has enough new content (i.e teleport gun) to be worthwhile. There are a few bugs but the quality of the gameplay balances it out. I highly recommend getting Clan Wars but only if sale ($25 USD is too high a price for a Worms game). Definitely get Clan Wars over Revolution.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but it sadly misses the mark quite badly. The game visuals are soft and unresponsive. The camera is sluggish and makes gameplay more difficult. The controller interface is an infuriating puzzle that never actually works as intended. The weapons are poorly implemented and lack the range of functionality required for any proper worms tactics. Overall, I'm very sorry I bought this game. But I'm more sorry that I'm still missing a proper PC based worms experience to share with friends.			"

												Worms is, by far, my favorite PC game. It's easy to play, quick for beginners to pick up, and still challenging even after years of (casual) play. Clan Wars has been nicely done. Beautiful artwork, finally a windowed mode, and plays well cross-platform, unlike the previous versions. I have not tried the Clan side of Clan Wars yet, but this is because I'm busy talking my friends into buying the game so we can.. clan. :)			"

												I really don't like the checkpoint in the game, which will end your turn immediately once you touch it. The check point is something should be helping players, but in this case it becomes something I am trying my best to avoid touching--more like a trap than checkpoint. The Ninja Rope in this game is bad as well. Comparing to Reloaded (the only other worms game I played, it is also the reason why I bought Clan War), it is much worse. You have no way to control your rope if you touch the wall, but in Reloaded you can bouce off the wall, which made it possible to go from place to place using rope.			"

												Sigh, you most likely already know what worms is about, it's one of the most well known video game series, and it is the essential party game. For the antisocial people that live under a rock (no offence though), Worms are creatures that have a long cylindrical tube-like body and no limbs. Worms the video game series is about teams of those creatures killing other teams of those creatures in a turn based format, sometimes with usual weapons, like an Uzi, and sometimes with a CONCRETE DONKEY.But really, it is a very simple game, that's probably the reason why it's so popular, it's incredibly easy to just pick it up and play, and 18 years and 60 million copies sold later, the worms formula has been basically perfected.Now, the worms games have been heavily criticised for publishing new games without much new content, and I completely agree, and this game also follows the same format, it's still the old 2D, worm killing, psychopath game we all love. But it also add some new content, I know, weird right?This game has 3D graphics, the whole terrain, items, worms and weapons are fully modeled and rendered in 3D, even though the gameplay is in 2D. Also, it adds a single player campaign, now, I usually dislike having a single player campaign just for the sake of it, but in this game I feel like it is it's highlight, the story is really quirky and funny, and the narration by the psychopathic Crypt Creeper Tara Pinkle is just wonderful and really funny, one of the best parts of the game. The game also has an extensive character and terrain editor, with steam workshop compatibility, making it really fun to customize your game. And finally, the game has extensive additions to online multiplayer, there's a Clan option, allowing you to create a team up to 8 players and face off against other clans, and ranked mode, for both player vs player and clan vs clan, a clash of clans, if you will.This game also looks really good, the 3D models and textures are really well done, and the game looks gorgeous, the 3D graphics are a step in the right mine-filled direction. And as I previously mentioned, the game has Steam Workshop compatibility, and it allows for some really funny and creative worms, like one that says Terry Crew's lines from the insane Old Spice commercials.Also it has a very User-friendly interface, it's easy to figure out what each weapon does, the help menu is extensive, and the game has a great controller support. Also steam achievements and cards.Overall, this game more than just more of the same, but it still is basically more of the same, so if you don't yet own a Worms game, this is undoubtedly the one for you, but if you already own one, the only real reason to get this one is Tara's spectacular voice acting.Read more video game reviews at cassus.org "

												Team17 had recently a lot of downtime of their servers for Worms Clan Wars.It was very frustrating not being able to start a mutliplayer match even all players were ready.A few days later, everything works again and online multiplayer fights are fully functional.So in case this happens again: yes it sucks, but give it some time, try some days later again, it's worth it.Worms Clan Wars is a classical Worms-Game from Team17 like the early versions back in the childhood.Still the cool old weapons like holy hand grenade, the Grandma Fart or the concrete donkey - but also plenty of new weapons.Its awesome to play it with friends - Consider buying a cheap 4-pack of the game. More friends having a copy of the game - more fun. I would recommend to wait buying it until a sale with a good discount offers this game, because the standard price is way too much. All in all: Awesome game!			"

												I bought this game, and everything seemed to work, but I can not rename any of the worms, or name my clan without the gamecrashing on me.  This rather defeats the purpose of getting to customize your own game when you are unable to.  I have tried fixing the problem, reinstalling, changing game permissions, but nothing has worked.  I tried emailing support and after a huge delay they emailed me back saying they would need to check if this was a problem in the actual game, and I have heard nothing since.  It has been at least 2 months with no reply.  I haven't played online, but from what I have seen there are issues with connecting with other players, if you find a match.For the story, I find the narrator annoying, certain levels are quite unfair.  Sometimes what you are suppose to do is not quite clear to solve puzzles.  If I play for too long the game crashes.  usually if I play more than an hour.This is my first and last game I will be getting from Team17. I have a Mac, so my recommendation to those who have a Mac and want to play a worms game is to either get it from the App store or get an older version of worms.			"

												Worms Clan Wars is another game at the famous franchise Worms. Like its predecessors, you'll create your team of worms and battle against other teams with an arsenal of weapons. However, this game has some changes from the previous versions and that's why is worth a shot. Graphics The graphics didn't change too much from the previous games. Th enviroment and the characters and colorful and lively, being nice to the eyes.  Gameplay The gameplay is the same of previous Worms: each player has your own turn and you choose one of your worms to do the action. You can move with the directional buttons, choose a weapon through your mouse or keyboard shortcuts and press the spacebar key to use the weapon. Depending of the weapon you choose, the effects at the opponent (and yourself) will be different, so you need to be cautious to not blown yourself up when you use the weapon. This is one of the many great things about the worms games, because a wrong use of a weapon can lead to very funny moments and even make you lose, instead of your opponent. When you use a weapon, your turn is over and it's your opponent turn. You win when every worm of your opponent is dead. If every worm, even yours, die, it will be a draw.Also, you can also use some items which help you to fight or get a better position to knock out your enemy and, different of when you use a weapon, you won't finish your turn when using it. For example, with the ninja rope, your worm can reach high places and even shoot at your opponent while escaping for your own safety. For example, you can use the ninja rope to go higher and throw a dinamite at your opponent and, before the dynamite blows (you have only a couple of seconds), you can reach another safe place and watch your opponent getting blasted. Your opponent will be damaged by the explosion and be throw at the air because of the explosion and even can fall at the water, losing all its hp. By the way, there's water and you lose your worm if you fall there. Oops, didn't I say that before?Anyway, it's really nice the huge variety of weapons for you to use at Worms Clan Wars. Plus, some of them are funny, like the powerful ""Concrete Donkey"", which, when used, a giant concrete donkey falls from the sky and go stomping every place at a vertical line, while doing a funny donkey sound.By the way, I said before this game has some changes from its previous games. Well, this time, your worms are not equal. At previous games, every worm is exactly the same, changing only its name, but at this game, there are 4 types of worms, which can add some deep to your strategy. For example, there is the tiny worm, called ""Scout"", which can be faster and jump higher, but they are weaker than the another ones. In another hand, there's the ""Heavy"", which is the totally opposite of the Scout: it is fat and heavy, so it'll be slow and jump really low, but it's more powerful than the other ones.  Audio & Soundtrack There's not many musics here, but the few remaining are nice to hear. But the Audio and sound effects are great! They are nice and funny, specially the many voices you can use as your worms voice. You can laugh a lot with these.Storyline Worms usually has no fixed storyline, except this one has a campaign mode about some worms hunting some rare artifacts. But you don't need to do the campaign, if you prefer only fighting to the death against your friends or the AI or both.The veredictIt's another amazing Worms game, with some good improvements, but keeping the old and good formula of success that made Worms a loved franchise. If you love Worms games, don't miss this one. And if you never played a worms game, try this one! It's lovely and I think you will enjoy!Rating:Graphics: 8/10Audio: 10/10Gameplay: 9,5/10Overall: 9/10			"

(Anti Aliasing and V Sync are off, alongside Shadows) Had the 3D backgrounds on to try matching a maximum of 30fps in game (I get a minimum of 24fps in Feudal Japan) (This speed or above is the recommended speed for your Worms Experience), as Deadrising 3 was on Xbox One (It was 720p in that version). In other Words, this game was built for Medium End PC's.I like the look of Steam Workshop Support. It allows me to use Wheatley's (From Valve's Portal 2) voice in the game for my Worms.

												great fun, I've cried from laughing while playing this and I HONESTLY thought I was playing for like 3 hours.... but it was 8.1 in one sitting because i have no friends. At first I wasn't a big fan because I played the classic worms on the older consoles, but the game grew so much on me super fast, play the game as it is, then make game modes with stipulations and play with friends. Only thing I didn't like AT FIRST (meaning I do like it now) was the class based worms but they're not that hard to comprehend. Fat worm with more health more damage, small worm faster doesnt activate mines, genius worm heals and does genius♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the default worm. Mindless violence, and strategic gameplay, probably good for anybody 12 and up.			"

												So Worms... It's a great game to play with friends. Never gets old it's just so fun. I don't really know what else to write for a Worms game but if you have friends buy the 4 Pack when it's on sale. Well worth it.			"

												2v2 with friends is probably the most fun you can have with this game!i even recorded some hilarious moments of us messing up ingame, or making epic shots.the modes are a little limited but with workshop support the game can survive longers(there are voice packs you can install to annoy your friends)			"

												Clan Wars was released less than a year after Revolution, so just this fact alone should tell you something. Team17 are just after some more money and this wouldn't have been a problem if this title was indeed bringing something new and better than the previous. But unfortunately is worse, way worse than anyone could imagine coming from an engine that shouldn't have suffered in such a short time. Problems such as multi-player de-synchs, audio effects cutting off mid-game, usually after the first round, and framerate drops are plaguing it. There are very few additions in terms of weapons and their area of effect seems rather limited.  They feel completely unsatisfying. Also don't be fooled by the contraptions you see in the snapshots. They're not available in multiplayer. I won't talk about the clans because neither I nor my friends are interested in building some sort of reputation amonst unknown players. But if you're after this sort of entertainment, you won't find any people to play against. In the end, all I've got to say about this title is that if you're after shiny graphics buy Worms Revolution instead, otherwise stick with the classic titles in this series, most notable Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party, where you get a pletora of satisfying weapons to decimate your friends with. The trend nowadays seems to be: throw to the bin a good game, apply a fresh layer of paint on top of a shaky new engine, ignore some good ideas from the successful releases in the franchise, and sell it in whatever shape it is. The good old reputation won't keep this franchise afloat for too long, Team17.			"

												Worms Revolution v2, this could be a patch to that game but it costs 25 euros, i just love how even worms has become COD style, new game each year to kill the old one and with only maybe %10 difference. this game will die as fast as revolution in multiplayer. i can not tell how much i love worms games dont get me wrong but the company is going WRONG way!

												After watching Sips, Turps, and Total Biscut play Worms: Clan Wars during the Yogscast stream, I was excited to play it. It looked very fun, with its numerous weapons of mass destruction, from dynamite to a bazooka. I really thought that I would love this slapstick-humor filled game, especially when playing with friends. But, unfourtatently, after playing only about 20 mintues of it (I admit, not enough to form a very good opinion of a game), I knew that my overall feeling for the game could be summed up by one word; ""Eh"". It was only okay. It had a rather odd set up that confused me. I wasn't sure if I should be focusing on the multiplayer aspect of the game or the single-player campaign. The tutorial, too, confused me. Not that it was a complicated game, but more that unless I was in a perfect position, playing with my friends, forming clans and the like, I would not get much out of the game. Another big problem was the controls, which I tried for about 10 mintues to adjust to my liking, yet none of the combinations appealed to me. It would simply not let me change to controls to allow my mouse to play a bigger part than it was. I didn't feel comfterable with having to adjust my aim for my bazooka with the arrow keys, especially when on a turn timer. Overall, I had a lousy experience with Worms: Clan Wars, but that doesn't mean that you should not give it a try. Just do a little more research than I did to find out wether it's your kind of game or not. To me, It simply was not enticing enough.			"

												Pros: - It's Worms and Worms is awesome - Decent Graphics, those having framerate issues should maybe try using a PC that doesn't belong in a museum. - Decent sound - Water physics are great fun - Level editor is simpleCons: - TERRIBLE online system ""Wormnet"" - Multiplayer is DEAD - Limited customisation options & items - STILL HAVEN'T BROUGHT BACK ""THE RAJ"" SOUNDBANK, WHICH WAS COMEDIC GOLD. - Needs more themes, lots more.If the Multiplayer wasn't so AWFUL, aswell as DEAD, then I would highly recommend this game.  Without decent multiplayer there simply isn't enough content to warrant a full price purchase.  $5 is the MAX you should pay and then only if you have enough friends who already own it.			"

												I was playing Worms Clan Wars around the same time as I was playing Worms Revolution, so I will mainly compare this game to that one.Worms Clan Wars has:- Fewer (and easier) single player missions.- Worse AI. The enemy worms kill themselves half the time. Some people were complaining that the AI in Worms Revolution was way too skilled, but I'd prefer that over this idiot AI any time.- More annoying (and less funny) narrator, although this probably is a matter of taste.- Game-breaking bugs. Some levels can't be completed and you have to do them all over again from the start, possibly even multiple times until you figure out what causes the bug.- Crashes.- A higher price.Overall:Don't buy this game unless you have already finished Worms Revolution and just want to do some more single player missions (that you might have to redo several times).

Old fan of the series from way back? You'll probably hate it!Fan of the series from newest titles? You'll probably love it!Never heard of it? Continue reading:Worms Clan Wars is a turn-based strategy game where you control a team of worms with one mission: kill all the non-beliver worms controlled by everyone else. There are four classes of worm to use to customize your army: - The Soldier, which is the average worm that you start with with no special traits other than manually detonating grenades. - The Heavy, which is very slow and cannot jump/jet high, but is bulky and makes a bigger explosive on death or by using dynamite.- The Scout, which is very agile, can jump/jet higher, fit into small spaces, see crate contents & doesn't set off mines, but is very weak in health and can be pushed around quite easily.- The Scientist, which is similar to the Soldier, in that it is average save that it heals your teammates on its turn for 5 points each and makes magnets or sentries last longer and do be more effective, but they also take more damage from weapons.Overall really, you either love it or hate it, but if you get it, play with friends with voice (better if using Mumble or Skype) as it's typically much more fun this way (and you can persuade a friend to kill someone else instead of you). The game is a steal on sale, even though I haven't clocked many hours yet (my friends won't play it :/), but with the 4-pack split among your friends it's even cheaper.			"

												Instead of adding the new stuff introduced in this game to Worms Revolution Team17 decided to make another new Worms game, which is even not as good as Worms Revolution. To be honest, it almost feels like a beta version of Worms Revolution.Here are just some negative points in this game:- You can not zoom the camera to the point you want, for me it's either too close or too far, which makes it difficult to play this game. In Worms Revolution it was easy to zoom the camera to the point I enjoyed.- Fat worms leave a massive explosion behind, feels unbalanced- Whats the point with the name? Worms is not meant to be a clan-game.- The environments are not as interesting as in Worms Revolution and they even don't look as good. Sadly they did not include the environment from Worms Revolution in this game.I like most of the new weapons they have included and I also like Steam Workshop support but that is almost it. There is no reason to play this game because Worms Revolution is much more fun. I think the time they spent creating this should have been used to improve the good concept of Worms Revolution.			"

												Worms Clan Wars seems to be a really good game. The weapons, controls and other features feels good. However, the art style for the levels and background really annoys me.What really puts me off from playing it, and actually made me buy a 4-pack of Worms Reloaded instead, is the extra layer for the levels that make it really hard to read which has collision and what is pass through. The part you stand on and navigate on has depth, since it's 3d. And that itself can make it slightly hard to judge where a ledge stops. But the real problem is the second layer of the level, which sits directly behind the parts you stand on. That layer also gets destroyed or mostly partly destroyed, creating an even more unreadable level.Worms Clan Wars has some good things, but my recommendation is to buy Worms Reloaded instead!			"

If only i could count the worms died to me due to some stupid bug or unpredicted behaviour of the pyshics that it's just ridiculous.Even if you're a Worms fan, do yourself a favour and skip this game.

												I'm sorry, I can't recommend this game. Especially when there are way better and larger Worms titles.I had fun playing this game, don't get me wrong. But that's purely because it's Worms. It just works, it's a great game franchise. But... everything else is lacking if you ask me.The graphics are bad. Really bad. Reminds me of the era when video games that were meant to be 2D were made in terrible 3D - just because it was new and exciting. I just don't feel that the 2D gameplay and 3D graphics go well together. In fact, the 3D graphics get in the way of the gameplay for the most part! sometimes you fall off edges because it LOOKED like you could stand there, but in reality it was just part of the background. It has a few problems with bad visibility (the backgrounds are just ugly and distracting), but this one is by far the worst.Next: it's a trainwreck on a technical level. It stutters like crazy! Not because my PC can't handle it (lol yeah right), but because the FPS are limited to a mere 30 or whatever. It feels like a console port! All the worms' animations are locked to 30 (or maybe just 24?) keyframes, making it look... not particularly smooth, needless to say. There's no excuse for it. My eyes literally start to hurt after playing this game for too long. It's really that bad - for me at least.As for the weapons: It may not look that bad at first glance. And it isn't bad, but... half of the weapons you're not even going to use more than once. In comparison to other Worms titles such as Worms Armageddon, the weapons are really badly balanced. Some weapons simply have little to no use. It doesn't even count as ""situational"", because it's that difficult to even think of a situation where said weapons are applicable. And when they are, it's better to go with one of the standard weapons anyway.The super weapons are lacking, too. There are only a few of them. And worst of all, they are sort of balanced. As in - Team17 tried to make all the different super weapons roughly the same in terms of effectiveness and firepower. Why? Because you can ""buy"" them by collecting coins in crates and spending them on a super weapon of choice. This may sound good, but it's awful (IN MY OPINION!!!1). Why are ridiculously overpowered superweapons bad? Isn't that the point of a super weapon?Next issue: A maximum of 16 worms. SIXTEEN WORMS. (Compare this to the 48 worms that Worms Armageddon has to offer) That means, in a party of 4, each team can only have 4 worms. It's not terrible, but sometimes you just want to have a bit of fun. Worms Clan Wars is just a lot less sandbox-y.Last but certainly not least - the ninja rope. What have they done? The rope physics just don't fit. Ropes are almost completely useless in this game. The most useful tool for transportation is the jetpack, which lowers the skill ceiling considerably.Okay, now for the good. There are water physics and different kinds of worms with pros and cons. Don't get me wrong, it's kind of cool, but just that: kind of cool.And this brings me to the final, most important part of my review: I know exactly why I dislike this game exactly. It is very accessible and has a low skill ceiling. An inexperienced worms player can easily beat someone with over 30 hours of playtime just with a little luck. People that are new to Worms will approve and like this game. They can't be bothered with the many menus and options that a Worms Armageddon offers. They just want to casually play a game of Worms with their friends. And if the same applies to you: Go for it, it's certainly not a bad game objectively speaking.But for someone (like me) who prefers game that have a learning curve, where you FEEL that you get better, I highly recommend you to buy Worms Armageddon instead.TL;DR: It's a good game, but has terrible framerate issues and a dangerously low skill ceiling. Many features feel handicapped and executed worse than in other titles. But on the other hand, it's a lot more friendly to new player who just want to play a casual round of Worms with their friends. I highly recommend trying Worms Armageddon instead.			"

												Coming from Worms 2, this game has the two features I always wanted... dynamic water and non-destructible terrain. Unfortunately, Team17 is the dumbest game developer out there and simplified this game to death. There's only one kind of water generator and you can only have two on a map, not to mention they are huge and take up a lot of space. They also remove any terrain around them and can waste water particles filling up the space they inhabit. The rope physics might be technically more realistic, but feel terrible and clumsy compared to the W2 rope. The amount of worm customization is very limited. The level editor is clunky and does not allow for precision land design with it's weird 3D look that makes it hard to tell what is actual land and what is decorative land around the actual land. As I stated, the game is terribly simplified in options of customization. You can't make wooden beams fixed, nor make them indestructible. There are no door objects or other nifty things. The water generators are also succeptible to being blown up and cannot be made indestructible. You can't set things to float on water either. You can't set the bounciness of the terrain, or the gravity, or a dozen other options that they could have easily made available. Why? Because it was designed for consoles and ported to PC/MAC. I really really hate this design mentality. Why limit your game by stupid consoles? I love my PS3 but at least make an enhanced version of the game for PC/MAC. Team17 gets 1 star from me, for being a terrible, narrow-minded company. They could have added lots of game modes like real time combat, which would open the door for even more modes, like soccer, capture the flag, american football, etc. There's also no snow or ice, which is another example of their short sightedness. The snow theme was my favorite in Worms2. Basically, this is a decent game if you need your worms fix, but I'd recommend not buying it and teaching Team17 a lesson.			"

												This game is in no way optimised for PC, with huge frame rate drops even on the lowest resolutions. In 600x480 it's playable, but the pixels are then so bad that the worms just look like pink blobs.It's a worms game, however and can still be enjoyable, but Armageddon is a far better choice.Plus:- A classic-style Worms game- Some cool new features to add variety to battlesNegatives- Mostly unplayable due to bad console porting- Essentially the same as Worms Armageddon but with a few extra features and far less customisation options			"

												Clan Wars is my favorite Worms game. I even like it more than armaggedon, probably because it has full controller support, is more accessable to newcomers than Armaggedon, has better graphics and also water physics. It is maybe not the best game for die hard Armaggedon fans but newcomers to the series (where have you been all these years!) should really enjoy it.			"

												i LOVE the worms series and i want to enjoy this game, i really do but it runs at such a sow frame rate, which leads to issues like input lag (something you absoulutley DON'T want in a worms game) To me it feels like worms revoulution gone horribly wrong, and that is my favourite worms game! the only good thing about this game is the graphjics, but revoulution was good enough and worms doesn't need good graphics. overall, nless you have an AMAZING PC, you are better off with revutio, reoded or armagedon.

												Honestly I have had the game for two weeks now and there are like 0 people playing it online. Maybe 1/5 of the time I log in there are people hosting a game its like a damn ghost town. Also, the matching and search system is complete garbage. The developers should make a game searching feature similar to what CS-GO offers where you just wait in a que instead of having to constantly hit 'search'. Also this is not worth 25$ this game should be sold at full price for 9.99 tops.			"

												Who even plays this Game? I mean i wait 1 hour to join a match but those people dont even click to make theirself green so its an forever going waiting process. The day i bought it, i thought its worth the 3 euro, but its not even 1 euro worth it.. Not worth my time. Just playing offline is boring as hell. The game is full of the polish force no wonder why we need to wait forever, dont want to be racist but i was not even once able to join a game since i bought this Game. I wonder why so many people enjoy this game. I personaly didnt enjoy any moment in this Game. The offline gameplay is just poorly and online like i said not working. Thank you whoever made this Game... Many People will say now:"" then why did you buy it?"" or "" Why dont you refund?"" I thought its a good game with competend people and i dont refund because the money i would get is just not worth my time. Dislike this review or whatever. This is my personal Review about this Game.			"

I think they will restart quick unranked matches servers too, so it will be fixed. On Wormnet you can play unranked too, so don't worry :)			"

												This is one of the most entertaining and challenging real time strategy type games I've played in a long time.  You will undoubtably kill your own worms many times before mastering their attacks and movement.  And that is part of the hilarity of it all.Overall I give this game 9/10.  The deduction of one point is because I think the worms have a little too much gas.			"

												Great Game! I wish more people played this online. This game is very entertaining, if you're like me, you'll spend some time on customizing your worms accessories; i.e. hats, bling, facial hair. Single player is a bit dull, but that's because you lose the comical value gained from multiplayer when someone makes a mistake and kills their own worm. If you're a fan of worms, I'd definitely buy this game.			"

												The thing that I learned from Worms Clan Wars is.. Proverbs followed by ""That's what she said."" never get old.-- Family Play --Worms Clan Wars has been great fun for our family. Our 4-year old and 9-year old both really love to play this game. I have a long history of worms play, but nobody else really does. That doesn't mean that I'm landing my shots, though.Worms is a game that is easy to play, but hard to really succeed in. I can't speak about the online play. Only how it works in my family. There are a lot of pre-packaged rules and you can customize your worms teams for local or online play.The graphics are really nice, the single-player campaign is a really nice way to be forced to learn all of the weapons / tools.My 4-year old loves putting on a jet pack and a parachute and just rocketing as far upwards as possible, then gliding downward.

												If you're planning on playing worms, go ahead and buy a four pack because you're gonna want to play with friends. This is probably the most fun you can have in 20 minutes with three friends, assuming you have three friends to play with. If you don't, you can randomly be matched with other people who want to play the game with you. If you don't like playing with other people at all, there's the perfectly fun campaign, voiced-over by the sadistic and sarcastic Ms. Tara Pinkle, archaeologist and adventurer extrordinaire. This is a very fun game, and very relaxed, easily playable once you get used to the slightly flash game-esque controls.			"

												Probably best worm game in long time. Game is basically same as Revolution, but huge change is clan system which is really fun if playing with friends. Also maps are littlebit bigger in clan wars.One great addition to game is steam workshop where you can download and make own costumes to your worms and own SOUNDBANKS. That is probably one of the best things in whole game. Adding fun sounds to your worms. ExampleArnold Schwarzenegger !Ranked games are fun but unfortunately ranked system sucks. Sometimes you get pro players who have played over 300+ hours the game and sometimes who have played 2h. Meaning you have to check your opponent steam profile in order to play efficiently and kick those who have barely played the game so you dont waste your time... Im not sure how it works. You can play online ranked games with one friend which means your team will be split to 2. Each player controlling 2pros+ clan matches+ bigger maps+ liquid water (also in revolution)cons- ranked system is bad "

												It's kinda depressing how many people DONT play this game... I really enjoy it. It is a twist on your typical ""tank"" turn based player vs player game play. Beyond some of the other games out there, The physics engine in this game 'Yes I said Physics Engine"" is pretty remarkable for what it is. The water is basically well... ""Water"" it doesn't ripple when you shoot it sorta speak. But the brute force of an explotion will send what ever water there is on the map flying, Careful... It will drown you or knock you off the map. The water follows the path of least resistance. It'd be nice if more people played this game. My buddy and I both get on to run a match or two to chekc out the community every night or so. Hell... If people add me I have no problem buying this game for them when it goes on sale if they'll play it.			"

												The controls are hard to get used to at first, it's poorly optimized, and it's hard to play with people online if they have a bad internet connection because it makes you wait for them, but if you can look past those flaws, it's a very fun game to play with your friends.			"

												I love the gameplay. However, the story mode didn't keep my interest and finding an online match is really hard. I'd get it mainly if your friends get it too, at least then you won't run out of thiungs to do. Other than that It's a perfected formula that not enough people play.			"

												They tried to reinvent a classic with 3d graphics on a 2d game. And horribly failed. This is just Worm-3d-bad. The overall grafic effect is painful for my eyes and so unoptimized it's going to stress your CPU and you. Maybe you could get used to that but I uninstalled it and tagget it ""Never More"" in my library before this could happen. ""Worms Reloaded"" is nothing new but it works, if you love the classic game, go for it.			"

You will undoubtably kill your own worms many times before mastering their attacks and movement.  And that is part of the hilarity of it all.Overall I give this game 9/10.  The deduction of one point is because I think the worms have a little too much gas.			"

												I don't like it, just my personal opinion. It's the exact same game as Worms Revolution which was released 10 months earlier, but the new menu screen, weapon selection, interface and narrator are so displeasing to me that I'd rather play the old version. Worms Clan Wars feels like an unintended step backwards.I am, however, eagerly awaiting Team17's next Worms game. Like clockwork, they've been releasing a solid title, followed by terrible one for decades now. It's no different from the 95/NT/98/2000/XP/Vista/7/8 pattern.			"

												First of all a disclaimer: I've never played any of the other Worms titles, I'm a total newbie at this so you won't find any comparisons in this review, which seems to be quite unusual judging by most other reviews. I'm also on a deadline to write this and it's a large game so I haven't completed the campaign like I usually do before a review, but I've played enough to make a judgement I think.This is a game that can be placed into 2 genres: puzzle platformer (single-player) and competitive/strategy (online multi-player).Story mode has bucketloads of charm and humour in keeping with the whole theme of the game. You progress along the main map and each level has an intro telling the story, explaining the objective and telling you to kill the enemy worms (in ever inventive language). You have a team of 4 worms, each with individual characteristics - big/slow with more powerful explosions or small/fast with less damage, and various other traits. Some levels you control all 4 and on some parts of the map they split up so you only have one or two. To complete levels you have to reach objectives by collecting weapons and killing enemy worms along the way. Some weapons are carried over to the next level, others have a limited number of uses, there are always variations in line with the puzzle element of the level. Some levels are an all-out turn-based battle, 60 seconds per turn in the levels I've played so far. In all cases, shooting at the enemy ends your turn. They have points values, some more than others, and if you only wound them then they get to shoot back at you and that's mainly how you can end up failing the level - there are other hazards too like machine guns, landmines etc.Worm Ops is more or less a tutorial with a single worm and a different weapon on each level to kill the enemy worms without any other objectives. The trickiest thing to learn is how much power to apply to your ranged weapons so they arc through the air accurately to hit the enemies. I suspect this is a key skill for experienced players but I still haven't got the hang of it, the enemy worms are much better at it than I am at this point.Multiplayer: my first foray was a ""partial success"", as they used to say on the Fast Show. I made several attempts to join matches but kept being rejected, perhaps because of my Beginner status. After a couple of hours I eventually I managed to join a game with two other players. It took so long to load I thought it was stuck and almost quit, then eventually the terrain appeared but one player immediately dropped out, or maybe failed to connect. The in-game chat didn't work for me so I couldn't reply to the other player, we took a couple of turns (during which I probably embarrassed myself) then he decided to quit so I won by default, whereupon the game CRASHED. I think I'll need a lot more experience before trying to compete anyway, I was overwhelmed with a full array of weapons choices having only encountered a limited number of them so far during my single-player campaign, so I would have been dead meat in short order had the game progressed any further.ProsKatherine Parkinson's voiceover (she's the TV actress best known as Jen in The IT Crowd comedy). Oh My. God. I could listen to her all day long anyway, but there's not another voice on the planet that could improve this particular game. Inspired choice.Aesthetics: crisp, detailed cartoony graphics and wonderful animations - the way they go flying through the air from explosions is perfect - with cute squeaky voices and funny little comments. The background music is happy tunes that match the level themes, all very pleasant.Customisation: you can rename your worms and there are many options for worm appearance (eg. moustaches, hats, comical specs), worm accents/phrases (eg. Angry Scot, Hostage, Wise Guy), level appearance etc. and as if there wasn't enough already you can download/create even more content with the workshop editor tool.Level overview: you can zoom in and out and mouse over the whole level to plan your strategy, spot enemies and places to hide etc.Overall quality: very slick and polished, charm and humour, loads of content, cross-platform.Performance: I have an i7, 8Gb RAM and midrange graphics (nVidia Geoforce GTX 550 Ti) and I had all video settings maxed. The offline gameplay is very smooth, no glitches. I've seen others complaining about framerates when there's a lot of activity on the screen but I haven't advanced far enough to experience that level of action yet so I can't comment on it. The online multiplayer is another matter.Value: after 12 hours I'm barely halfway through Story mode and the levels are already becoming pretty difficult, I'm having to make more and more attempts to get through. After that I can replay to improve my scores and climb the leaderboards which are based on time taken to complete levels. So all in all excellent value even without taking multiplayer into consideration.ConsNo Linux controller support. This was a big disappointment for me and it's not mentioned anywhere on the store page. People have said that it doesn't work well with a controller anyway but I disagree, I tried it and it felt much more efficient and natural. However, no offence to Win users but for me playing games in Windows is like trying to enjoy a nice meal in an overcrowded, smoke-filled cafe surrounded by festering armpits and screaming, puking babies. I'll take the keyboard in Linux, thanks.Multiplayer: there's a full built-in system for finding individual matches and managing clans, both of which have leaderboards, so all the infrastructure is there. However, my experience of it was not ideal so if it's mainly multiplayer you're interested in then perhaps this one isn't for you. Personally I prefer the single-player campaigns anyway, I'm a puzzler at heart.Strange default keyboard hotkeys but a) you get used to them after a while and b) you can change them.Hidden game mechanic: telekinesis requires the tab key to turn the object. This is not explained anywhere, either in-game or on Google. I discovered it by trial and error. You're welcome.VerdictA fun, highly polished game with tons of content and a good learning curve. The Story mode will give you many hours of platform puzzling and then you can hone your strategic skills in online competition with your customised worms. It's not a cheap game but still good value for the quality and amount of content.This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												I don't understand how this awesome franchise went as down for their two last games.First of all Clan Wars & Revolution are the exact same games! A real copy and past, even for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs!One of my favorite tool was the rope cause you could do really funny things with it, now you get stuck all the time and die because of that...Ho yes, now you have the water! Yeah.. The water... Well this feature is to-ta-lly useless...The 3D graphics did make sense in worms 3D, but in here there is absolutely no point to use it..The bots are completely useless! I don't know how many turn I have waited 45sec to see the AI doing nothing at all!The games modes are seen and seen again and again. Nothing really new.They could have create new vs games with this awesome feature (the water) but I think they realized how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it was and did nothing with it...Ho, and about the controls on a controller. Even this is totally wrong! The buttons mapping is totally TOTALLY NOT intuitive! I mean, jump with A? A?!! And fire with X? X?!!! That's the best way to mislead everyone!The only good point is the story and the voice acting. It seams they spent all their money in it....Anyway, I'm so disappointed with those games, I really miss the previous worms...It a shame cause I really like this franchise, I have so many memories playing with friends. But recently it not fun anymore. It just kinda fun mixed with gameplay bugs & annoyance...			"

												Worms clan wars in my opinion was one the best games in the franchise, but I cannot safely reccomend this game. It IS an amazing game, and I would DEFINITELY reccomend it if you have friends to play it with, but the online community has long since died, and there is almost nobody playing anymore. If that was not the case I would be able to safely reccomend this game. Try some of their other games, as they have more active communities			"

												Like most Worms games it's just an upgrades version of the previous Worms game, This one being Revolution. That's not a bad thing, Worms in it self is a great game so any improvment or added features/equipment is welcomed and this game delivers! So many new items, Weapons and customization making this in my opinion the best Worms game I've played yet.			"

												How can they keep getting it so wrong?Before you even begin the game you're assaulted with the worst menu imaginable. It's a mess of clicking back and forth. So many clicks to access options that should be in one place. Basic UI design, or even testing the usuability should have addressed these issues. Why does each succesive Worms game have a worse and worse UI? It's been downhill since Worms 2. Like our thumbs have been growing non stop since the nineties. It looks like it's made for a touch screen interface, and probably was. PC versions should have PC interfaces.I'm so vexxed about the UI I don't really even want to talk about the game. Back to Worms Armageddon!			"

												The game looks visually atrocious with jagged edges around everything, I'm not normally the kind of person to complain about graphics, but the game just looks bad, even with anti-aliasing turned on, the game also runs at a terrible frame rate (generally hovering around 20fps) on a PC that easily meets the minimum required specs.I am a huge fan of the Worms series but I unfortunately cannot recommend this game whatsoever due to the horrific visual problems this game has.

												Dear Team17, why are you still trying to fail in making a great game better with 3D and the exactly same gameplay. The low poly Landscapes feel boring, even with high settings the edges are unsharp, the music makes you fall asleep and the textures look like a 500% zoom onto some picture.Can't you just try to add some gamemodes, worlds with physics and destruction or funny new weapons into some new worms game with a sharp and clear graphics style? I cannot see any reason to recommend this game and will never buy any new Worms as long as it is as boring as this one.Anyway the idea of having a Macro-World in a Museum is great at least and the FX (even if they don't match the graphic style of the rest of the game) are nice, too.

												Game looks like it would be a lot of classic worms fun but I never got that far as the game runs with such terrible performance on my PC that I cannot play. Before people ask yes I do have a decent gaming rig. Not the top of the line but if I'm able to play: BF4, Borderlands PS, and AC Unity I'm sure it ""should"" be capable of handling the graphics on this game even if on lowest settings. However after checking obvious things like drivers/updates reinstalling and such I was unable to get this game to run on reliable framerates above 15. I opened a ticket with Team17 and one of their reps did exchange emails with me to troubleshoot the issue (briefly) but in the end i was told:""Thank you for attempting all of the actions which we have previously recommended.At this point, it sounds as though you might be one of the unfortunate handful who are experiencing a yet unresolved performance issue with particular system configurations. Please know that you information has been raised to the appropriate team and should be reviewed shortly. Our apologies for any inconvenience that this issue may be causing you in the meantime.""This was back in November of 2014....still nothing was done to help address this performance issue. Until this is resolved I wouldn't recommending purchasing this game.			"

												It's just Worms Revolution with a bunch of added leaderboards and some new content.  Minus a few more points for the ninja rope being soaked in water and no longer magically standing on your weight, to end all the fun you used to have with it.It also was entirely incompatible with my computer (that didn't stop me from trying it on another, though).  The screen was black, just with the HUD displaying.Its new graphics may look good, but it's very hard to tell when the map ends and the background begins, leading to a lot of stupid mistakes usually ending with a worm either falling off a cliff for land damage and a wasted turn, shooting himself with a rocket, or just drowning in the water at the bottom of the map.Just buy Worms: Reloaded and/or Ultimate Mayhem if you're looking for a good Worms game.  This one might be a little fun, but if you're a big Worms fan, you're probably going to be disappointed with this.			"

												I was enormously let down by this game. First of all, all I get in-game is a black screen, so there's definitely some bug in the visuals. Secondly, there is no versus mode between teams that is not Deathmatch. In fact, creating new teams is needlessly complicated, as the game automatically creates one for you using your Steam name. Why can't it just use the Armageddon principle? This game is not at all structured like older Worms games, so those of you wanting an updated Worms experience in the reign of Armageddon, stay away. At least I got this game on sale.			"

												From what I've played so far, it seems to be a great game. Originally I played Worms: A Space Oddity on the Wii, and this is much like it, but with waaay more things, and way better graphics. If you played other worms games I definitely suggest getting this.			"

												Imagine if you loved marmite one day, then despised it the next, breaking all the rules. That's how Worms Clan Wars is for me.On the one hand, the artistic maps with dynamic water provide a highly involving environment on which a remixed version of the classic worms gameplay can take place. Moving worms about with water - particularly small bodies of water released from high terrain, sweeping worms to their doom or at least discomfort - has proved very entertaining, much as it did in Worms Revolution. The weapons are exceedingly well balanced with just one major exception, though even that (the Concrete Donkey, of course) is more challenging to use now due to realistic interaction with the terrain. I'm impressed how tricky it is to make use of some of the most powerful weapons, for example it's rare to be able to get a lot out of the Old Woman unless on a very basic landscape with some long, gradually sloped or flat sections.The darkside to the game involves somewhat dodgy physics when attempting to move about. For the most part, things are alright, but every now and then a worm will get caught on a small, pretty much invisible speck of land and this can ruin attempts to cross decent distances with a single jump or rope swing. Speaking of the rope, that really can be a nightmare, as for some reason it tends to get caught on bits of land very easily, forcing you to release and try another shot (if you have one). Not only that but it has a notoriously unreliable 'up and over' feature, which sees a worm that has pulled the rope all the way in to the land attempt to spring up from the rope to get into a ledge. It's about 50/50 whether the worm will make it or not, and if not - and this is the real troublemaker - the fact that the worm makes contact with land removes its ability to shoot out a new rope and save itself. All too often this results in a worm sliding into deep water or off the map entirely. Brilliant blow-by-blow standoffs have come to an unjust end as one player attempted to relocate just a short distance for a more strategic bazooka launching position.Overall though, the game has entertained me enough to keep me coming back, despite a bit of lag due to the game's minimum requirements being a bit higher than the specs given in the store (trust me - I've tried turning all the options down to their lowest).While I'm at this I may as well add that I feel the game would have greatly benefitted from the inclusion of a couple weapons in particular; the mail strike (a tactical wind-affected strike for which I always enjoy watching the different items of mail affect each others paths in Worms Armaggedon) and the Ming Vase (a cluster weapon dropped like dynamite that was good for blasting away several layers of land in W:A - making it a great tactical weapon despite being 'super'). This is, of course, a matter of personal opinion and does not affect the rating for this game that I am giving, which is:7/10So I do reccomend this game provided your PC/Laptop exceeds the minimum specs slightly (e.g. at least 4GB RAM) and/or you are willing to set the various game options to the minimum .

												Pros: Great fun. Many improvements over worms reloaded and the bugs from that game are not present. Interesting variety of weapons and the AI has been improved. Graphics have been improved too.  Lots of customization options.You can choose between different worms to have in your team. Scientists for example heal nearby friendly worms, scouts can move faster and don't set off mines, soldiers make a huge explosion when they die, etc. This adds a bit more strategy.Cons: Online multiplayer is deserted. I could not find a clan or a ranked online match with people. You will most likely need to play this with IRL friends. This is a multiplayer game!! There should have been more out-of-the-box variety in landscape art. Neutral: The music is only OK. It could be better.Careful: This game may not have cross platform support.			"

												Well this game isn't exactly bug- or  lag-free, but it at least is fun. This is one of the funniest unrealistic battle games you can get out there, being worms who are smacking each other with holy hand grenades, banana bombs, super sheep or even concrete donkeys. There is also the option to customize your worm, from their looks to how they talk. Just like any other fighting game, don't try this at home IRL. Especially not if you really are a worm.My score: 7			"

												This is without doubt the most hilarious game I've ever played. Never tried online-multiplayer and I don't plan on it either but if you have two or three friends to play with you will definitely have a good time.Can't say it is a game to play for hours straight but those few matches, only lasting minutes, in between watching series and shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in csgo is something I've begun to look forward to. For its fullprice at 22eur I can't say it's worth for a cheap guy, but no person shall ever find this game boring.If you have played any other worms games then you know what the deal is but I cant guarantee this one is the new♥♥♥♥♥♥since Armageddon. Really.8/10 or smthn whereas the last 2pieces are missing due to poor(or hardmanipulated) settings and graphicbugs without understanding.			"

												For a long time I've been waiting for Team 17 to release a working version of Worms World Party that was compatible with a version of Windows beyond 98. I don't really think thats ever going to happen because Team 17 insist that Armageddon reaches feature paritywith WWP before thats possible, and they no longer work on that game.So, this game is pretty close. It doesn't seem to run that well on my ATI hardware (my computer is fairly rubbish anyway), but its pretty good in terms of being somewhere between the Armageddon kit and the WWP kit. The physics feel pretty spot on. I don't know if thats good or bad, considering the cartoonish tone, but as a whole it all seems to knit quite well. Its true that the backgrounds confuse the foregrounds a little, but moving the mouse around tends to resolve the confusion. The museum set idea is cool, and the narrator is quite droll (funny), but the water (bottom border) is a really crappy texture/surface that is entirely unbelievable, particularly in context of the museum set.I'd give it a 7/10 production value, but as usual, with a Worms game, the real value is in having someone to laugh at your incompetence in trying to kill them. The game seems to do that exceptionally well, and allows hot seat, so it gets atleast one more point for longevity. The online component is deserted, but LAN and hotseat is what this game as always done best anyway. Its an underated gem in the Worms series.			"

												This is the first new Worms game I played since Worms 3D, and maybe my memories of the older generations of 2D Worms games have been filtered through nostalgia, but I just remember World Party as much better than this game. The third dimension adds practically nothing to this game, in fact, the game would probably have looked better with high resolution 2D environments instead. The worms have a terrible knack of constantly getting stuck in terrain, even more so than in older installments.The online rooms are almost devoid of life, maybe because Team17 choose to release new Worms games so close that the community can't keep up support for them. The single player campaign is not very good at all. All the missions have you drudging through linear levels full of annoying mechanisms for your worms to get stuck in. The AI, by the way, hasn't improved at all in the 12 years since World Party either.I'm not sure about the introductions of specialized classes, it's all right I guess. The only new thing I really enjoy is the water mechanics. That's not enough. It's disappointing, but I could rather just reinstall World Party and play hotseat than keep playing this game.			"

												Worms Clan Wars is a really great game to play with friends, the integration of the Steam Workshop means that it's more hilarious than ever. Over the week that I've had it I've already racked up 14 hours on this game and counting. I'd really recommend it if you're a casual player or you just want to mess around with friends. It's not amazingly optimised truth be told but it makes up for it with a Campaign that teaches you about all those weapons you never really knew what the hell they did. If you're on the fence, I'd say go for it.			"

												Why did I buy Worms Clan Wars and not Worms Reloaded? This is so much worse... It's 3D, looks ugly, very laggy and slow on my laptop (even on LOW settings), although I can run, for example, Crysis WARHEAD perfectly fine :( It's so laggy that most of the time it processes double Shift (back flip) as single Shift (forward jump) and my worms simply jump into water. Can I replace this with much more classic-looking, 2D Worms Reloaded? :)UPD: Oh, and did I mention that Worms World Party or Worms Armageddon are still the best? Hell, even Hedgewars is 10 times better than this (serioursly, try them out).			"

												I do love me some worms games. A great multiplayer game and even great fun to just mess around with alone. My only qualm that I feel needs mentioning is the lack of customisable play styles. I put a great many hours into Worms 2: Armageddon on the xbox and loved the feature that I could immediately start overtime, or limit the weapons or cut turn time down to a few seconds. It always made things interesting. Clan Wars should have done that and more. Supposedly, they stopped because they didnt want the interface to get to messy, but it would be a good ""advanced"" panel that really spices up the game. I only wish that someone could fix this on the Workshop.The game is still great and you should buy it, but keep in mind that it is not the most customisable worms game out there.			"

												Well this game isn't exactly bug- or  lag-free, but it at least is fun. This is one of the funniest unrealistic battle games you can get out there, being worms who are smacking each other with holy hand grenades, banana bombs, super sheep or even concrete donkeys. There is also the option to customize your worm, from their looks to how they talk. Just like any other fighting game, don't try this at home IRL. Especially not if you really are a worm.My score: 7			"

It's still just Worms, but the game runs smoothly, the graphics are good, the silly comedy is still there and blowing you friends away in this game never gets old!Only complaint, if at all, the price is a bit high, but get it on sale and you'll get a great value buy.

												Pros: Great fun. Many improvements over worms reloaded and the bugs from that game are not present. Interesting variety of weapons and the AI has been improved. Graphics have been improved too.  Lots of customization options.You can choose between different worms to have in your team. Scientists for example heal nearby friendly worms, scouts can move faster and don't set off mines, soldiers make a huge explosion when they die, etc. This adds a bit more strategy.Cons: Online multiplayer is deserted. I could not find a clan or a ranked online match with people. You will most likely need to play this with IRL friends. This is a multiplayer game!!

I am a fan of Worms, i think the Armageddon is the best for PC. I have a good PC, so my experience with this game has nothing to do with my config or drivers.What i really disliked:  - horrible input lag, around 500ms ! - bad visuals - auto-scrolling is stuttering, with or without vsync on... - stupid story...who needs it in a Worms game ?!Positive things: - i can't really mention, if you really want to play Worms you should get the Armageddon.

												While the community is not as lively as it could or should be, and prior entries to the season (such as Armageddon) are going strong to this day; as a whole, Worms Clan Wars may be the best 2D Worms title yet. Expanding on Revolution's physics-based combat, especially dynamic water, this is a game that requires a change in strategy from say, Worms Reloaded. For example, in Worms Clan Wars, when a grenade is thrown anywhere that is not completely flat land, it rolls. Typically in an older Worms title, grenades would not be nearly as affected by gravity. This makes combat either much easier, or much harder, depending on how you are at the game. Either way, it requires a bit of getting used to.Clan Wars' strength lies in its customization. While Mac users are out of luck currently regarding the Steam Workshop, everyone has open access to the in-game level editor, which is excellent and very easy to use thanks to a selection of brush and line tools which make precise editing simple.Unfortunately this is a game, and an entire series that shines with its multiplayer; but the community is lacking, as of now. So, unless you have friends to play with, you may want to get Armageddon instead.If that's not an issue, by all means buy this. Especially on its current $6 sale.			"

												Worms Clan Wars is a really great game to play with friends, the integration of the Steam Workshop means that it's more hilarious than ever. Over the week that I've had it I've already racked up 14 hours on this game and counting. I'd really recommend it if you're a casual player or you just want to mess around with friends. It's not amazingly optimised truth be told but it makes up for it with a Campaign that teaches you about all those weapons you never really knew what the hell they did. If you're on the fence, I'd say go for it.			"

												I have never played worms before, but I have seen videos of it and it looks very fun; however after buying this game I couldn't get into a single online game.  I am very dissapointed that there is never anyone online.  The single player is pretty boring and runs on pretty low FPS.			"

Also, rope mechanics and such are totally ruined thanks to the new physics engine-even Super Sheep are rubbish.DO NOT BUY, I bought it on sale and it was a waste of my money.Team17 should go back to Worms 2/Armaggeddon/World Party and start from there if they're doing 2d plan worms again, their new attempts are just pitiful.

												*I have not played other versions such as revolution, nor do I play any sort of single player mode.  I play this with friends online.That being said, we have fun with it.  If you can get it cheap and you don't already have other versions of the game then it is worth getting.  It is a turn-based game (turns are timed, so watch out) where you try to knock out your opponents.  The wide variety of weapons are not complex, but you can make them more effective with proper strategy.  Multi-player seems relatively smooth and the variety of maps has lead us to play this game over and over again.  A single round is reletively quick.  We play this game while we chat or while waiting on other people to show up to play more time intensive games.  It seems to be playable by a wide experience range.			"

												I am really disappointed. The graphics and the reviews sounded OK, so i bought the game. It was not _that_ cheap, so i have to warn the people. I am a fan of Worms, i think the Armageddon is the best for PC. I have a good PC, so my experience with this game has nothing to do with my config or drivers.What i really disliked:  - horrible input lag, around 500ms ! - bad visuals - auto-scrolling is stuttering, with or without vsync on... - stupid story...who needs it in a Worms game ?!Positive things: - i can't really mention, if you really want to play Worms you should get the Armageddon.

												While the community is not as lively as it could or should be, and prior entries to the season (such as Armageddon) are going strong to this day; as a whole, Worms Clan Wars may be the best 2D Worms title yet. Expanding on Revolution's physics-based combat, especially dynamic water, this is a game that requires a change in strategy from say, Worms Reloaded. For example, in Worms Clan Wars, when a grenade is thrown anywhere that is not completely flat land, it rolls. Typically in an older Worms title, grenades would not be nearly as affected by gravity. This makes combat either much easier, or much harder, depending on how you are at the game. Either way, it requires a bit of getting used to.Clan Wars' strength lies in its customization. While Mac users are out of luck currently regarding the Steam Workshop, everyone has open access to the in-game level editor, which is excellent and very easy to use thanks to a selection of brush and line tools which make precise editing simple.Unfortunately this is a game, and an entire series that shines with its multiplayer; but the community is lacking, as of now. So, unless you have friends to play with, you may want to get Armageddon instead.If that's not an issue, by all means buy this. Especially on its current $6 sale.			"

GameplayGameplay has improved since I last played a game of Worms, but the core gameplay is the same. Some weapons has been added into the game, but most of the classic weapons is still there. You are basically worms with weapons killing the other worms. The last worm alive wins. There is a good amount of strategy in the game, which makes it a fun and a challenging game. The multiplayer is quite excellent too. As the name suggest, you can now form clans to create the ultimate team. The game also features a singleplayer campaign, which is heavily underrated. There is also a lot of customization, you can change anything from how your worms speak, to what clothes they are wearing and a lot of maps in the workshops. GraphicsThe has been modernized enough to keep it classic for nolstagic fans as well as newcomers. Worms has always been a cute-killing game. There is also a lot of depth in the levels and interesting map design. Too bad they are not as memomable as the earlier games.SoundAll the guns sounds satisfying, especially the explosions. The voices the Worms makes when they die are hilarious too. VerdictWorms Clan Wars is an excellent party game, and with the brilliant multiplayer it makes it even more easy to pick up and play. It is worms, guys! What else can I say?! "

												I honestly loved the franchise, and played most of it. The game created a whole new genre, and didn't give a chance to any rivals to compete. This game, though, I feel like it's missing the soul of Worms. It limited many options which customized weaponry, and the amount you want for battle. Another thing is, the online system seems a bit unfair, and needs to balance it so that the person who gets the first turn is at a bit of a disadvantage because the players with the later turns can get teamed up upon, and just thrown off cliffs into water. Don't get me wrong, the game still kept many of the qualities, and is still fun to play with friends.			"

												Overall I can recommend Worms Clan Wars to everyone who likes to have some fun with friends.It's a not the most versatile game ever, but with regard to provoked emotions it's awesome. While being happy with the run of the game, the next player's move can turn the tides substantially. From rags to riches and the other way round, this game has it all!Downside: The game is not well optimized and players may experience lags and stuttering in some parts.			"

												My friends and I have spent quite a bit of time enjoying multiplayer chaos. The game is pretty good, my only complaint would be that I wouldn't find a few more match options in multiplayer games. I want to be able to further customize the match rules. I also feel it doesn't have as good of weapons as Worms Armaggedon, however, that could be nostalgia talking.			"
