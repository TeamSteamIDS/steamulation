												0/10DO NOT BUY! IF SOMEBODY GIVES YOU A COPY, IT STILL ISN'T WORTH IT!The main problem with this game is that it is a multi-player only game with dead servers. Which means that people paid money to sit in a lobby waiting for somebody to show up. They never do. Save your money and buy Blood Bowl instead, a game with a solid single-player mode AND a healthy multiplayer community.Add into the mix how many teams have been cut out just so they can be sold back to you at a stupid rate, and you have the worst purchase ever on SteamEDIT: This review was written before the ""Knockout"" edition came out ""too little, too late""I haven't seen the new version because the DRM only allows limited downloads, and since I replaced my PC I've not been able to activate it. Take from that what you will.			"

043/100The game comes with no in-game manual. I hope you already know how to play Dungeonbowl!Oh you don't? Well you are out of luck then.2 Years after release a 1 player mode was finally added. Hey, better late than never right?And all the DLC is now included for free. What more could you ask for? Deserves a thumbs up right?WRONG!Dungeonbowl is a game about managing your team, customing your team and playing matches with your team. So what we thought what we would do is, in 1 player mode you can't use your team and instead have to choose a pre-made team thus removing the WHOLE POINT OF MAKING YOUR OWN TEAM! Oh and no progress is saved for that pre-selected team either!I just...NO!Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												Since the update there have been some changes, but my opinion on whether it is worth it or not is still the same.  I will admit I am glad they got rid of the outrageous dlc and added some ai, but the has changed very little.  The single player is shallow with only allowing the player to choose pre-selected teams with no team custimization of any kind.  The multiplayer online for all intensive purposes is still dead, and the online ai teams kinda break the whole purpose of online multiplayer.  Glad it changed but still not worth it.			"

												I am of the rare breed that prefers Dungeonbowl to Blood Bowl; after extensively playing and enjoying the tabletop game, I waited for this game to be on sale.  Purchasing it I was initially impressed with the game play but frustrated with the difficulties in finding an opponent.  I made teams to match my tabletop ones which won consistently but here this was not the case.  I pressed on assuming that I did not have the skill and it took me time to get used to the interface.  I eventually realized that my gameplay had little to do with it: the rules were subtlety different and at times broken, such as game duration limit and no blitzing off a teleport.  The final blow for me was the Dwarven Deathroller which in my opinion is so broken that I have caught myself swearing at my monitor at least forty times.  All other ""big guys"" have a detriment skill like take root, really dumb, etc. but not this beast.  I calculated that teams I played against that did not have a Deathroller, I won >65% of games while if they did have one, I would win less than 20% of the time.  Why not make a team with a Deathroller, Trou?  My answer: why not make a game that is at least reasonably balanced?I am able to look passed a lot of this game's flaws that are stated here in these accurate reviews but combined together with this diarrhea on top, I would not recommend this game even if you love the table top version like I do.  Jepumk said it best: it is a poorly realized version of the table top game.			"

												Don't even try it.  As a fan of the Bloodbowl Game, I thought this couldn't be too bad despite the the negative reviews, right?  I won't regurgitate the comments already posted in the negative reviews, but I will add that once installed, it will not uninstall correctly, just launches the game every time you try to delete local content.

												Altho I really like Bloodbowl (Have only been playing it for about 15 years) and I adore Dungeonbowl, this iteration of the game I can not endorse. It lacks polish. It lacks flair. It lacks a decent AI, UI and single player campaign. Seeing how the campaign works in regular BB, I don't see why Cyanide couldn't let the player make a single player team. Instead you can only play offline with premade teams. Kinda missed the mark, by a mile or two...			"

												this is not a game, is a bad DLC for bloodbowl sold pretending it to be a full game. Which it is not.this is a complete crap for many reasons.1) It's an online-only game, no single player or AI of any sort, there's not even a tutorial, nothing. you sit in the lobby waiting for a player to show up for hours, and when it does, the connection is bugged and the challenge system doesn't work.2) the game itself is just bloodbowl with walls. good? nope. because the nice and functional free camera that worked as a charm in bloodbowl, here is cramped and unfunctional. you will not understand a♥♥♥♥♥♥of what is going on in the match, because there will always be a wall in your way.3) the game comes with a super-♥♥♥♥♥♥ third-party DRM which gives you a total of 3 activations. this means that if you uninstall this game 3 times, the 4th time you can just throw it in the toilet, because it won't work.STAY AWAY FROM THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥ GO PLAY BLOODBOWL INSTEAD.

												In the kindest and gentlest way I can think of, or at least, the way that uses the fewest expletivies, I will attempt to review this game.  The short version and all that you probably care about is the fact that... it SUCKS!!!  Ok, with that said you can stop reading or continue if you want details.  First off, this game is online, LAN, or hotseat only.  No singleplayer.  Yep, Multiplayer only.  Also the interface is terrible, the sound is underwhelming, and the dungeon creator is abhorrent.  The only redeeming factor seems to be that the character models are interesting.  I am a fan of Cyanide and enjoy Games Workshop, but this game is crap.  The only thing keeping me from being disappointed in this game is the fact that I got it as part of a Bundlestar deal where I paid less than $1.00 USD for it.			"

												When people still played this game, it wasn't bad.  It was a fun experience.  However, since this is a MULTIPLAYER ONLY GAME, only in a blue corn moon will you find somebody else to play with.  I cannot recommend a dead game, no matter how good or fun it was.They eventually added sorta-singleplayer, but it's just not the same as the other games in the series.  Instead look for Blood Bowl or something else similar.  This game just isn't worth your time or money.DO NOT BUY THIS! "

												Kinda disgusted at this crappy attempt to make a few more bucks with little effort done to do it properly.The lack of a tutorial mode or even a manual meant I spent ages working out how to teleport more players into a game and eventually I found out how through an online forum.In saying that, you can get past that part eventually by just learning on your own.  What really grated me was the misleading comment about playing against the computer ai.  That is total bulls**t.  The only option to playing against the ai is a lame exhibition mode, unlike the bloodbowl series where you have proper single player campaigns.Don't waste your money on this one.			"

												Richard Walter Zisk (born February 6, 1949) is a retired Major League Baseball player currently in charge of pro scouting in Florida for the Chicago Cubs.[1]Zisk was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates out of Seton Hall University in the third round of the 1967 Major League Baseball Draft, and made his major league debut on September 8, 1971 replacing Roberto Clemente in right field in the eighth inning of Pittsburgh's 10-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, and got a single in his first major league at-bat.[2] Zisk also made seventeen appearances with the 1972 Pirates, however, he was not on either team's post-season roster.In Zisk's rookie season, 1973, he batted .324 with ten home runs. On June 9, 1974, he hit for the cycle in a 14-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park.[3] For the season, he led the Pirates with 100 runs batted in while also clubbing seventeen home runs. He made his only post-season appearances with the 1974 and 1975 Pirates. While batting an impressive .400 in the post-season, Zisk only scored one run and had no RBIs as the Pirates were swept in the 1974 and 1975 National League Championship Series by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds, respectively. Following the 1976 season, the Pirates traded Zisk along with Silvio Martinez to the Chicago White Sox for Terry Forster and Rich Gossage.			"

												Got this on sale so I figured it would at least be worth the sale price but I was wrong. It takes about 10 minutes to load even the smallest match and then the AI just stopped working halfway through the match. Had to just sit and wait for it to run out of time each turn... so broken.So sad this has so much potential to be a faster paced take on BB.			"
