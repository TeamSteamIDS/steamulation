												Battlepillars is a cool tug-of-war game that has great value and a decent spectrum of difficulty (towards the end). It gives you about 10+ hours of content with a few types of challenges for various campaign levels. The bosses during the later half of the game also require a bit of contemplation and strategizing because they start becoming a bit more challenging.As an added bonus, the multiplayer was seamless and I had no issues whatsoever while achievement hunting with a friend. It's one of the more casual strategy games out there in the same price range but it was definitely quite fun. I definitely recommend it whether you are buying it for your phone or on Steam.			"

												WOW, easily the best 2 pack ive ever bought.. great price and even better game, simple yet deceptively complex. A solid campaign with tons of unloackable upgrades. When I post d about addtional multiplayer modes in the future, they responded quickly and positively. We picked up x2 twin packs and have been playing it head to head and switching opponents between the four of us. I am hereby recomending this game to all my friends. I will also be checking out other games made by these Devs. the gameplay reminds us all of Swords & Soilders, which has been one of our favorites since we got in the Wii like 5 years ago. When we saw that game on Steam we picked it up and enjoy the online multiplayer modes in both of these games. REAL online multiplayer done right... we look forward to buying any DLC for this title the moment it is available. Also we hope they add 2vs2 multiplayer ASAP. Swords & Soilders sadly never did. Bravo Devs! Battlepillars Gold Edition ROCKS!			"

												About game cards:First game is nice for buy if you want to level up and create new badges but it has 15 cards!!?!About in battle:Otherwise game is nice i love games like this. More armor you give they become more strong and they upgrade to captain and more. To get  more leaves you need to upgrade that's in the corner of the game more you  upgrade faster you will get a leaves. Money: Well in this game you don't have gold or other money. In this game you have an apple for money. With money you can upgrade items, buy new items, give new sking and get allies for help.Story:In this game is not a lot of  story you just start and contiuned.Bosses: Bosses are in 7-8 levels they show there you will need to be very careful how do yo use you're army cause they will win.Gameplay:Well game is easy you need only mouse to play it :DAt all this game is worth for buy!!! You will enjoy it for few minutes or maybe for hours			"

												Battlepillars was originally a phone game, and it certainly shows. But does that mean that this isn't any fun? Certainly not.Here's a Quick Look video of what you should expect when heading into this. Take a look if you're interested or just read my summary of the game below. Just a warning though, it has birds carpet bombing with their crap. 


YouTube™ Video: Battlepillars Quick Look 

			Views: 5,239		

			Watch Noble of Lost Pause take a quick look at Battlepillars, a tug-of-war game of mutant insects armed with nonsensical armaments. I honestly can't describe it any better than that.		

I'll start by saying the basic premiss of this game is a tug-of-war between two sides, something you've probably seen before in other games. But does this do anything different? No, not really. However, it's still pretty fun to play.You construct your units with a regenerating resource that can be upgraded to regen faster for the same resource, the cost gaining in price every time. The units  themselves are mashed together by a decent number of parts you can select before going into the match, and each one does different things, such as make your guy charge faster, shoot enemies at a distance, knock the enemy backwards, set up mines, poison an enemy, heal the soldier over time, and so on. The charm to it is constructing the unit you want to make and seeing it charge into battle and (hopefully) crush your foes. You just have to keep in mind that even though you're creating a stronger unit, it costs more to make it while the enemy might be swarming in on you.The other fun part to this game is customizing your soldiers with skins and upgrades, and you can choose which upgrades/skins you want without having to go through others first, which is always appreciated. I also like how open ended this game is about beating certain levels/challenges. There isn't always a correct way to go about something to achieve victory. You can either spam out fodder to overwhelm your enemy, have a mix of certain parts that benefit off each other, or have titans with every expensive part you can throw on it that stomp mostly anything in their path. There's just a good number of things you can do.But lets talk about some of the negatives now. Because this is a phone port, there isn't much interaction with you and what's happening on the field. You're kind of farting around and waiting to send out your next unit. While it is fun to to watch your units do the work, I wish there was more you could do than just summon an animal friend.I'm also not a fan of buying straight upgrades for parts you already own. That doesn't encourage swapping parts from ones that you made better than others. I much rather play with a different weapon to give my units than use the same ones for every mission simply because the game is that much easier with them. The fact that the game limits how many parts you can take into battle also irks me. There could've been a lot more depth to the game if you could always choose a counter unit to what your enemy was sending at you instead of being stuck with what you chose and hoping it works out.But to sum this game up, even with the lack of interactivity, this is still a solid title for under 3 bucks currently, and possibly still worth it for 5 if you enjoy a decent time waster. The multiplayer options also open this game up for more fun if the campaign and endless modes aren't your thing.			"

												I didn't honestly expect this game to be that good, having picked a key up for free. While lacking in higher strategy, this game has managed to turn a simple concept into a decent experience, my main issue being resource management and economy. The simple concept of 'build minion, send at enemy' could have been done quite poorly, however with Battlepillars there is a decent amount of customisation that makes the game fairly enjoyable to play. The current price level is reasonable (as far as steam goes when there isn't a sale on) so you may want to pick it up if you have younger children who are better suitable for a simple mechanic. Note: Please bear in mind that the stuff you unlock in single player is what you often get in multiplayer (there are options to limit the opponent to mutually aquired items, and to grant opponents the items you have if they don't.) This allows for some  seriously unfair matches (+150% resource gain for example) that will often sweep you quickly.In conclusion, it's not perfect and it may be a bit too simple for some, but it's still reasonably enjoyable to play.Overall, 5.5 - 6.5/10EDIT: Accounts from other people have highlighted problems I have not yet experienced myself. Please take into account these other accounts before considering purchasing this game. Thank you!			"

												Battlepillars is somewhat similar to Swords & Soldiers. You're moving battlepillars across the screen, in 2D, from left to right, and have to engage in fights with other battlepillars. Get to the base of the enemy, destroy it and you win the game.The game isn't about tactics but more about spamming these creatures as fast as you can, if possible with as many weapons as you can add. You see, you can create your own battlepillars by selecting which weapons you want it to carry. By collecting and generating leafs you can make your creatures even larger.Winning a level earns you apples that can be used to upgrade your battlepillars, special powers and/or base. All of this is extremely fascinating stuff. So fascinating that I got bored within an hour. But considering the price it's not a bad deal at all. There are just better alternatives out there (I urge you to look at them).[Rating: 62/100]			"

												This game is great fun! It's essentially a tower defence game. You spend your resources to build caterpillars armed to the teeth with flamethrowers, sticky honey, mines, machine guns, and more! in the hopes to eliminate your opponents base before they elinimate yours. It's a very simple mechanic but works extremely well and is very fun to play.			"

			the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/280930		

It's a fairly a simple game.On the left you will have a leaf counter that goes up slowly, this is used to pay for pillar parts or make the gain faster.Your pillar parts are under the battle field and what the little guy will look like is above it.Each segment of the pillar is added to the head and then you send the little tyke off to kill.Each part you add gives them some hp + whatever bonus the segment gives like say armor, speed, hp, defense, but most are weapons.When you send them out they will start at your tree (left side unless your in co-op) and move out until they come to an enemy or the opponents tree.At that point they will attack with what ever weapon they have or bite if they have none.Push them back and take out their tree without them doing it to you first.If the level was at the base of a tree on the level map you'll fight a boss.After fights you can upgrade your pillars segments, the tree's leaf gain, tree hp, the trees gun or change your pillars skin.There are also 3 animal helpers that you can buy to call in during a fight, a squirrel (gives you leaves), a turtle mage (slows enemies), & a bird (craps on all opponents and they will lose health).

												One good thing about the game is the upgrades.  As the game progresses, new tools and upgrades become available.  Some of them use unit that will help your team or hurt the other directly.  The unique thing about some upgrades is that some of them do not work until later.  For example, one upgrade acts as a revenge bomb.  Once the unit dies, it will unleash several smaller units that will start attacking the enemy.  Another upgrade is calling in allies that will aide your side through effects like attacking the other side or bring in extra supplies.  These ally units come at a steep price, but they can turn the tide of battle if ever in a tight situation.Unfortunately, the weakest part of the game is the battle itself.  Like most strategy games, you need to send your units towards the enemy base.  However, these games usually have a detailed map where terrain is part of the strategy.  With Battlepillars, it is always a straight line with no option of changing direction or even sidestepping.  Without a way of changing things along the way, it becomes merely a battle of unit selection.  Even with that area, there is not much strategy to use there, either.  As mentioned earlier, you can buy new units in order to use deeper strategies, but that really is not necessary.  By using a few powerful units with a little speed and/or armor, it becomes too easy to overwhelm the enemy with only a few units.  This is especially true with multiplayer.  In multiplayer, the first player that can send three strong units will usually win the battle.  Without the need to think, the battles are merely a series of crashing units.The battle’s one redeeming quality is the gold challenges.  Along with simply defeating the enemy army, a gold challenge asks you to complete the battle under special circumstances.  Some of them are simple enough like using a certain size unit.  However, others require things like limiting how much you can use.  When working under these conditions, it forces you go use some strategy.  It is not enough to save the game, but they help it from being a total lost.			"

												Initially due to the graphics I thought this was a kids game.. I was mistaken. Its a pretty fun push style game where you get full customizable control of your units. It can feel a bit spammy in the beginning but as you get to later levels more strategy is involved with how you build your units. Overall a really cool idea executed well, only downside is the MP seems to be a bit dead.			"

												A fun tug of war game where you pick weaponry and amount of segments desired for your battlepillars and send them across the screen to engage the enemy who is doing the same. Various weapons are better in some situations that others, so you have to pick with care and react to what the enemy is doing, as well as determine if you want to armour up or hope to blast the enemy before you take too many casualties.There is certain a lot to experiment with, as the various weapons systems are very distinct with different damage levels, ranges, side effects, as well as some other segments to add armour, slow the enemy, or apply a damage over time effect, etc. You also have to factor in length - the longer battlepillars have more health and survivability as well as firepower (normally), but move slower across the screen - so if you want to use heavy armored battlepillars with lots of segments to defend ""glass cannon"" units that do the damage you will need to plan ahead to ensure they get there before the previous one dies.The single player campaign is pretty good, there is a reasonable amount of variation even apart from the boss fights which mix things up further, and of course you unlock new weapons and upgrades as you go along. Multiplayer is presumably pretty dead unless you have some friends to play with that probably isn't going to be a reason to get it at this point. Overall though, it is an easy recommend even for just the single player portion.			"

												I normally don't play this type of game, but this one held my interest well while only being mildly addicting. The late game could use some balance tweeks, but overall I would say my purchase was a bargain.3/4. A nice distraction; well worth the dollar I spent.			"

You can battle against your friends in a epic fight for dominance or try your hand at the single player campaign. Buy BattlePillars now and march(do caterpillars march?) your way to VICTORY!!!			"

Name: BattlepillarsDeveloper: HitcentsDate: 2014Genre: Rail RTSPopulation: Ghost TownPerspective: 2D - Side-ScrollingTimeflow: Fast-Paced, Match-Based, Real-TimeSkills: Brain > FingersSetting: UndefinedStyle: Cartoon, ComedyTags: 1v1, Cross-Platform, Indie, No Story, SimplisticModel: B2PContent: SolidPlatforms: PC, Android, iOSReview: Simple comedy styled 2D strategy, where ants fight each other with miniguns and rocket launchers. Build your perfect army of ants to counter enemy strategy and destroy their tree!	Every battle starts with each side having a Tree - barracks with 1 turret, where your ants come from.	You construct every single ant right during battle from segments - parts of their body, which can be weapons, armor, legs, or some utility stuff like honey-throwers that slow enemies or spider eggs which spawn spiders. All segments have different stats and Leaf cost - so the more segments you add to an ant, the bigger, stronger and more expensive it will be. Leaves are the only auto-generated in-battle resource, its production can be upgraded to increase generation rate - so you always have a dilemma of building another ant vs upgrading production right now - games are very short and every second matters. You cannot directly control units - once they are ready, they will go forward to an enemy tree, until they meet enemy in their attack range. Note, they move with different speed too - 1-segment ants will overrun your 6-segment monster and die with no use long before he shows up - unless you time things correctly.	For destroying trees you get another, non-battle resource, Apples. These are used for buying new segments and upgrading old ones, upgrading the tree, buying skins and Allies.	There are 15 segments total, each segment can be upgraded 3 times, but you can only choose 6 for each battle. Think wisely.	Skins change how your ants look, and more important, they also change stats. Different strategies require different skins. The only one I couldn't get is Golden (hidden) skin - it is only unlocked when you complete gold challenges of both campaigns, and I only completed 1st one.	Allies are game-breaking 1-use powers, which you can buy for lots of apples. Like a bird bombarding the battlefield with dung and destroying everything like a nuclear bomb. I didn't use them during campaign, AI doesn't use them either :O - they feel like cheats.	Campaign has different levels divided into missions, each ending up with unique boss - a huge tree-sized ant. All of these actually require different strategies to complete, and many of them will require you to restart until you know your enemy well. Each level has a Gold challenge - for example, to complete it with some limitations or conditions, varying from very easy to extremely hard.	Game is Android port, PC version is called ""Gold Edition"" for there is 2nd campaign, Moon missions. Its so hard I could only finish half of it, with only 3 Gold challenges - a real test of skills.	Strategic depth is pretty good, people invented many strategies already, but somehow multiplayer didn't appeal me at all - I didn't even try, though for strategies I usually do.	Nice small game, but not for long.Class: III - BreadVerdict: YesReviewed: 8.24.2015Versions: Battlepillars Gold EditionApproach: Steam - PCTime: Several Dozen HoursDeeds:  1st Campaign Complete With All Gold Challenges All Upgrades All Skins Except Golden 77% Achievements "

												Well, out side some minor farming of apples, which allow you to buy upgrades, there is not much wrong with the game. Even that was covered, if you put your mind set wise, just try to get the golden bonus for each level.Music for me got very annoying but was very easy to just turn off with no issue. It is good fun, and a challenging Tug of War game, the AI is not dumb. Each mission has its own ways of being beaten and just a matter of testing the waters or making your own path. I love the Slug medics, and wide options to choose from, for this price point, yes its worth your time. In this review I cover what you need to know, but I decided to do so in a fun manner, I hope you enjoy and check out other reviews here. https://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho

												The issues with this game are well captured on other reviews, I won't reiterate (I just wish I read them before).* No difficulty setting, game expects you to grind lower levels until you get what you need.* No buying guide. Game allows you to buy whatever you want, and the the AI assumes you have what you need to deal with rushes, not cool.* Minimal to no strategy. It seems like you conduct the battle, the the problem is that a specific set of tools will work on a specific level. Get in, get beaten, try again with a different combo, again, again, until you realize you don't HAVE what you need, so GOTO 10; (grind)* People put the gold challenges as a plus, but it isn't, because to get gold you need tools and tools cost apples and you get extra apples by getting gold, so you either have what you need and breeze the gold or you don't. Helps with the grinding, EXCEPT gold makes levels harder so it's not even grinding, it's hard grinding.Would I recommend this game? No. If I do, someone will pick it up, get stuck at the 10th level or so, flip it off and go to sleep, never to play it again. Why would I do that, when so many great games are on sale for less? And for what? I'm not condemning the graphics, or the gameplay, or the music (fix that loop, BTW, at some point it just ENDS), I'm condemning the laziness of the developers to put in difficulty, which is mandatory for casual gaming, and a mild hind on what should use for a particular map. I don't have infinite time to waste on trial and error. Some people do. They play on Normal/Hard. I don't. I play on easy with hints. In good games.			"

												Battlepillars is an absolute masterpiece of a game. Ground breaking graphics which put the Frostbite engine to shame, extremely good performance on computers which have less than desirable specs, and an encapsulating and emotionally deep story which will drive you along a rollercoaster of emotions. Enter an engrossing world where the player assumes the role of a colony of caterpillars which rise against their fascist, oppressive brethern in an epic conflict which will try your resolve, morale and ability to lead others to victory. With a limited ammount of resources and an unrelenting foe, you must lead your citizens in a revolutionary conflict the likes of which have never been seen before. The conflict of Battlepillars will make the Russian Revolutions of 1917 look like a picnic day. Once you realise that the war against your extremist allies is fruitless with troops, you must call upon your allies in arms to lift the siege against your territories, including a large, blue feathered bird, which will decimate your foes in an unholy storm of hellfire.After beating your enemies back, you must then press the attack deep into enemy territory, eliminating high ranking officials of the enemies war-machine, and steamrolling any resistance in your way until total and utter victory is yours.Battlepillars Gold Edition was a gift from a dear friend, and I thank them from the bottom of my heart for blessing me with this masterpiece of a game. Anyone with polarised opinions of this game should definitely invest their money in this work of art. Some claim that The Last of Us should receive a Game of The Year nomination, some would also argue that it is Grand Theft Auto V which has reached the zenith of what is quality and an excellence in design for the gaming industry. These critics have clearly never experienced the ferocity that is Battlepillars. Words cannot explain the utmost respect I hold for the creators of this game, who have blessed gaming community worldwide with a masterpiece which will not be forgotten anytime soon. 10/10- Dinkum			"

												Somehow way too hard.I got this game thinking that it looked like a nice little game to kill time and unwind... I was wrong, after I struggled finishing the 1st boss (seems like there is 8 of them) I got stuck on the first level of the second act. And seems like the only way to get by this level is upgrade your parts to be stonger. And if you upgraded your parts to play more of a rush tactic and face ennemies with flame bomb (which does AOE) and destroy any weak unit, well you're screwed. You need to go buy some other part and upgrade them which cost you 150 apples(currency of the game) and you get around 12-14 per level. So go play 20-30 times the same level in order to level up a bit to get by this level. SO MUCH FUN! It seems like this game was made for android and you could pay to buy apples to get un-stuck from harder levels. Had fun for 30 minutes. Uninstalled and will never play again.			"

												Battlepillars is a tug of war kind of game where you make up to 6 segment catterpillars with different unique parts , like shell for more armor , legs for more speed , a ray gun for area damage , or even a bazooka why not?.This game was originally a mobile game and you can really tell the amount of microtransactions it had , luckily for pc you don't have to pay a dime other than to buy the game , but max upgrading your favourite part, base or even buying a premium skill like instant wipe enemys deployed require a giant amount of apples (the previously currency bought with cash) and the multiplayer of this game is dead but you can still play with your steam friends if you want to.The game consists of 50 levels with a boss every 10 but the gameplay gets repetitive quite fast, this game is definetly not worth 5$ but if you find it on a big discount sale or a bundle you might want to get it for an hour or two of fun... and steam trading cards! everyone loves those.

												This game is great. You basically put a lot of parts together to make a ""battlepillar"" and send it out to fight the enemy's battlepillars then the one that kills the other and advances towards the enemy base to destroy it. It's a lot more fun than it sounds, leading you to come up with new strategys left, right and centre to keep up with the enemy's strategy. The campaign mode is fairly long and has interesting modes and enemy strategys which change throughout but the best part of the game is grabbing a friend and going 1v1 where you and your friend will be frantically trying to outdo each ther in a battle of will. I highly recommend it.			"

I don't recommend or reject this game. I wish there was a 'neutral' button, not because the game's bad, because it's casual.+Funny game+Well-made casual+Nice upgrade system+Lots of armors, weapons+Achievements-A little 'gay'-There are free and funnier games-Weak online gamingPROS1. Funny gameThe game's much funnier as it looks like, believe me! I bought it at a 75% discount and for the first ten or or fifteen minutes I thought what the f'ck am I playing? Don't even believe I bought it. Just gonna give a chance then leave. But turns out that the experience was better than I expected and I'm completely sure I wasn't the only one who thought like that.2. It's a well-made casualEvery single detail was well drawn and well thought. The leaves falling on the ground, the 'pillars crawling to attack, the weapons animations, everything. It sounds stupid - but it's not, having a well created game, even if the concept is not good (not saying this game concept is bad, just giving an example), boosts the gaming experience a ton times.3. The upgrade system is coolIt has a very nice upgrading system where, unlike almost all other games upgrade trees you usually afford useless (sometimes expensive things) to reach the stronger ones, this game allows you to focus on what you need.4. A considerable amount of armors and weapons are availableLots of weapons and armors are available! Lots of them! Thus, the game is way more personal and less linear, you can evolve the way you want and follow the upgrades you want. The upgrades can be related to 'pillar skins (generally armor or life upgrades), 'pillar segments (support and attack upgrades) and various others, such as increasing leaf regen or you tree maximum life.5. Ingame achievementsThe game has Steam and ingame achievements (the golden leaf). Earning any ingame achievement earns you more money to upgrade your soldiers, upgrading them probably will give you more achievements and so on.CONS6. A childish interfaceDespite the game being awesome, its interface is waaay too childish - even though is a more complex strategy game than it looks. The point is: there's no problem for you if you intend to buy this game but if you do so you'll probably want to play alone. If you have roomates or relatives constantly passing close to your computer there's a very big chance (if not certain), that you will be mocked. You shouldn't even discuss this game with other people that are not close friends, or else there's a possibility they may guess you're a little childish, or even gay (not saying it's a bad thing, okay, just poiting this out). This is, in my opinion, the most important topic of this game. If you urge to buy it please consider this topic 6 strongly.7. Free and funnier similar gamesYea, despite this game's great there are other free and even funnier games! One of them is the [/i]Epic War[/b]. Here are some of their best games with the same line of thought of Battlepillars and even better graphics, made of Flash: Epic War 3[www.kongregate.com] Epic War 4[www.kongregate.com] PalaDog[www.kongregate.com] Epic War 5[www.kongregate.com] Miragine War![www.kongregate.com]They're all casual and more funny than 'pillars.8. Weak online rooms I've been playing since a long time and I've never (I repeat never!) seen an online room to play with. That's not a problem and does not change gameplay but you should at least consider it if you will to play with someone or earn all the achievements. "

												If you're going into this wanting a well-presented time-killer of a flash game, you may like this. For someone hoping for a complicated base defense or tactics-heavy game- or even something as complex as a basic tower defense game- you're likely going to be very disappointed [as I was].Pros*Didn't seem to have any bugs*Polished presentationNeutral*Putting together parts is as cool an idea as you'd expect, but you never really feel a good impact from adding a single part, and the aesthetics feel like they could have been made more interesting.*Upgrading system is straightforward and uncomplexCons*Available Parts have preferential- rather than tactical- relation to one another. This is emphasized by the small number of parts you can bring to a map.*The map interactions are bland and repetitive, with the same tactics working each go, and the enemies feeling far too identical*Combat is overly simplistic- hands-off combat can be fun, but only if team building/tactics is emphasized, which in this game, it is not.*The game is far too easy- likely because making it harder'd require a more complicated combat system.*The interface is lackingIn summary, the game is just overall lacking in depth. It- as the store description states- is a tug-of-war game, not a strategy game.Of course, if you want a tug-of-war simulator represented by sacrificial swarms of caterpillars with special woodland summons to affect the outcome, then by all means, this is your game!This would have done a lot better as a free flash game- even for fans of the casual strategy genre, I can't recommend paying full for the game, not with better games cheap or even freely available.2.5/5			"

												Wow I'm glad different people like different games cause it gets a lot of positive reviews. I don't like tower defense games or casual games so this certainly is not for me so if your like me, think twice before buying. With my backlog, I just don't have enough time to invest in a game like this.			"

												Really, really good value. Especially during Summer Sales, when its a dollar. Large amount of content. No ""pay to win"" to be seen, which is surprsing considering it was originally a mobile game. Fun, exciting, difficult, and it has multiplayer. 8.5/10. Pretty good, but not perfect.			"

												This game is very random but also a ton of fun. You build segmented catepillars (segements might have legs=extra speed, miniguns, grenade throwers, etc etc) and fight incoming catepillars with the objective of getting to their tree first and destroying it. I'd say if you can get this game on sale, buy it.Pros:-Simple-Fun-RandomCons:-Mildly repetitive-Difficulty varies drastically (like one level might be hard but then next super easy)Rating: 8/10			"

												This game when I first saw it wasn't the game I thought it was, but when I started it, the joymeter went to from 10 to 100 in 2secs. It's really refreshing from that kind of games (tug of war), upgrades, combos, ressources, all those adds to this game a nice touch. The concept of using caterpillars is actually pretty cool, the skins are funny at times (like the hippy one), they make look caterpillar like real predators and badass! The levels, well it's a tug of war, what do you expect from a tug of war map? else than a straight line. Bosses are quite long, still not challenging yet (just spam with 125 cost of legs then gg). Sometime challenges for the golden flowers (bonus in missions) are nearly impossible. Available in nearly any possible language (even japanese!) it is really easy to play and learn, I could give this game to a 6years old kid and he could play it easily. Haven't tried the multiplayer yet but I think it's pretty much the same but with all upgrades unlocked.Overrall i give this game a 9.5/10 would fap again -IGNSeriously recommend it.			"

												I got this game in a bundle, and it was easily the best one in the batch.I've played many line defense+attack games on websites like Kongregate and newgrounds, and Battlepillars is remniscent of those childhood memories. If you like line defense/attack games where you have to create units to destroy your enemy, you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are nice, and the music is pretty decent. The weapon effects are not too flashy, but it still works well.The controls are simple quite, with visible hotkeys if you don't want to click on your caterpillar parts. The learning curve is minimal, and the tutorial is fast and helpful, allowing you to get a feel for the game very quickly. The feedback for both the enemy and your units are provided as small health bars and a minimap helps you keep track of the action. You can zoom out to view the entire battlefield. Unlike most games of this style, you do not have separate unit types to send out. Instead, you have caterpillar parts that you can add to the base (the head). Each piece has a different function, and the cost increases with each added component. Your ""mana"" to send out units comes in the form of leaves, and you can upgrade the maximum leaf pool (which also increases the generation rate). Periodically, leaves will drop on the ground, and you can click these to add quick points to your pool. There are quite a few pieces to choose from (ex: long range cannon, armor, speed legs, slow gun), and you have the option of upgrading each to a maximum level of 3. At each level, the aesthetics for the piece changes, something I particularly like to see in games. A few levels into the game you will unlock base defenses (a fixed turret) and the ability to upgrade your base components. You also get special weapons (like a bird bomb, a turtle slow, etc) that are one-time use (and very expensive). To buy upgrades, you use apples that are rewarded at the end of every level. As you attack the enemy base (a tree), apples will randomly fall - picking these up are optional but highly recommended.The grinding is actually very reasonable and can be quick. You can even afford many of the upgrades if you just progress through the levels.There is an option for getting a gold (flower/medal) for each level if you complete a specific challenge. For example, some might ask you to beat the level under a time limit, or to use x max number of leaves, or x max number of caterpillar parts.The game plays very well and can be a lot of fun if you enjoy this type of playstyle.Definitely recommend!
