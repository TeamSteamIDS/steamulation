												Let's see... First, no multiplayer LAN/Steam capability(only local hotseat). Second, There are no extra gamemodes other than classic(no Capital Risk, no Same-Time Risk, no choice in 60%/80%/100% Domination, JUST CLASSIC.... ONLY CLASSIC). Third, the game just doesn't really articulate the battle sequence and will leave you wondering what just happened. If you want to play Risk on your computer get Risk: Factions, this game is horribly incomplete. Alternatively, you can download Risk II on CNET but it is up to you to get a game to work with no support(just like this game I imagine).Post Sctiptum: Same-Time Risk, best way to play in my opinion.

												If you just have an itch to play the classic game of risk but no one will play with you this game is for you.  There is no online multiplayer but it does have local multiplayer.  It's good for someone like me who doesn't really care about online play for a game like this.  It also lets you play the game fast pace because you can quickly skip through the computers turns and then see what happened and make your move.  No more waiting for that one pesky player that just wont go, and no worried about someone online going AFK for long periods of time.  If this sounds like something you would desire from a game this is a good pick (I travel a lot for work and it is a nice game to play when I am sitting on a cramped air plane, I have even played with other passangers I meet sitting next to me).  If this game sounds like you I would also recommend picking up the game of monopoly on here that is also on steam, it is a very similar setup as this game. If you just want online play then your going to be disappointed and I would recommend avoiding this game.			"

												If you feel the need to play Risk but have no one to bring to a table, this scratches the itch slightly. But you can only play against AI (which doesn't act remotely human), the virtual die rolls tend toward extreme results with implausible frequency, and even the interface is somewhat unreliable. I mean it about those die rolls - you can easily go from the only player with long-term control of defensible continents to the guy getting hosed off the map because the ""dice"" gave the AI a 10:1 kill ratio when it counted. Granted, this partly compensates for the awfulness of the AI, but it's still pretty aggravating. Oh, and it crashes or drops your current game from time to time, though they're getting a little better about patching it. But it's just a bad product.. Sadly, it's also one of the few of its kind I've found on Steam, hence my embarassingly huge play time.			"

												This is a good game for the $5 I spent on it when it was one sale. It would be even better with online multiplayer but no game is perfect. One of the best games to pass time with, and it is much quicker to play than the board game. This game does have ""Hot-Seat"" local multiplayer for those who are interested.

												Risk, one of the best and most competitive board games I've ever played. Your goal is to conquer the world. Achieving this won't be easy though. You'll have to be tactfull and keep an eye on your competition all the time.Pro's:+ If you like the board game, you will like this version aswell.+ Nice graphics. Nothing too fancy, staying true to the original board, but with a new touch.+ AI is tactfull. AI will try to prevent oponents to gain/hold of a continent.+ Customization of your game. You can set a limited amount of options in order to customize your game.Cons:- Very limited gameplay options. No missions, no on-line multiplayer.- Replayability is low. Ofcourse every game is different, but due to the limited amount of options it feels like repeating the same over an over very quickly.I can recommend the game for the true Risk fans. If it's on sale it's even nice to pick up if your relative new to the game. However else I'd save my money for something else. Mainly due to the limited options a no for Risk. I'm giving Risk a 4/10.			"

												Why would Hasbro put out a port that doesn't even include the original rules or options for the board game?  No way to randomly be assigned territories, them place your armies one at a time as you wish.  AI is the worst of any online Risk I've seen.  Drisk for Android is better.  All they do is take a territorry and leave 1 army, then swap back and forth amassing 60+ armies that they then do nothing with until their continent bonus gets broken.  I agree that $3.99 was $3 overpriced.			"

Now, before I pressed POST I checked other comments and I see everyone feels the same, so you should really PASS this game.

												After reading all the comments about this game I was skeptical but decided that I like Risk and I went ahead and bought the game up and I am glad that I did. The game never crashed  on me, and I destroyed the AI after an hour of playing against 4 other computer controled players. There were no freezes, there was no game lag, nothing that kept me from having a fun time in a Risk game I have grown to love over the years. I felt like the music was fine and set a good mood and pace. Honestly the only thing the game could benefit from are some instructions - what does this card type do if I get 3 in a row? Or what does this button do? The rules of movement in each phase? etc etc. If you have ever played Risk before, you should  be fine.  If you haven't, then one play through of the game will explain it for you with learned, hands on experience. Honestly, the game is a Great buy and I wouldn't be suprised if you end up being happy with it too. TY Steam for making this game available!			"

												There are two games you want to win at when attending a party to really flash your nuts--prove that you got big ole steel ballz.  Of course, those would be Chess and Risk.  Ladies, I know you don't have ballz, but I know for a fact you kan dominate at Risk... so don't think I'm discriminating.  We'll just say if you have an iron cl*t... or something.  Why do we always measure dominance in ballz?  Anyways.....This is a bare-bones version of Risk.  You can tweak a bit of the rules, but very little.  It's essentially classic Risk, like when it first came out.  It's single player, unfortunately... because EA doesn't have the money to throw down on figuring out how to make Risk f**king multiplayer.  But.... it is redeemed in its fast gameplay.  You can choose to auto battle or roll each turn.  Each game lasts me only about 10-30 minutes which is nice so you can sneak a quick game in once in awhile.  No mission cards, or tactical cards, which I very much like.  I think the original board was perfect in itself and enjoy this pure experience.  It's great to practice different strategies on since the games are so simple and quick.WORD TO THE WISE: Alright, really this game is kind of a giant load of sh*t.  Don't let the description by the developers fool you.  They could have made it a million times more immaculate. It IS a great alternative to all the shotty attempts at Risk knock-offs.  But it's also the same game, essentially, that is on Pogo.  So your money is probably better tossed there if you don't permanently want this in your steam library.  At least on Pogo you could play other people... you can't make alliances unless you pay money though.Caveat emptor~Risk works half the time on my computer and half the time just completely frizzes out in ridiculous ways I can't understand.  I am pretty sure this is a Win8 problem, but if you can tolerate the program freezing 50% of the time you try and play, it's worth it.  Try and get this game on sale, definitely.. unless you REALLY have that kraving for Risk.  I'll throw the specs for my laptop up on my profile if you want to compare... I suggest going to canirunit.com or whatever the hell that one site is when trying out games.			"

												So I played this game thinking perhaps that it would be something simialr to the adaptation released on the PS1. Sadly I was very mistaken.  It's very simple, multiplayer has to be done on the same computer (I can get that for PS1 but on a PC? LAN should at least be an option). To top it off, the 'dice' rolls are blatantly rigged in the favour of the computer opponents. Even accounting for the base game's bias toward a defender, it's staggering how blatantly the computer loads these digitial dice.All in all, for a digitial game of risk, you'd be better dusting off that PS1 and firing it up. At least it also had plentiful maps and game modes.			"

I would also add that this is possibly one of the greatest sta\tergy games ever made and I actually spent hours playing the board  game version, (remember them?), whilst sitting on the engine decks of a Challenger Tank waiting to free a small country from a naughty man so we could all enjoy cheap fuel for the rest of our lives - ( no I didn't get any cheap fuel either but it made some people, (political dig coming up), millions of dollars to ""relive"" thier experience of the mind cripplimg events).Anyway, back to the review and, I must say, if you need a quick injection of thought provocing strategy action this will do nicely!!

												Ten dollars for this basic edition of Risk is too much, you can [purchase a physical version and get the full indepth experience for that kind of price (obviously plastic or paper pieces)But for 5 or less, it's not bad, I'd even recommend it for 50% off or more. The AI is smart on hard, it's simple click and or drag and thats all.			"

												If you like strategy, then this is the game that will capture you for hours. But that's about it. A few hours is all you'll get out of it. It has one function: the game of Risk. Absolutely nothing else. You will get five hours of entertainment from the game because of the lack of gamemodes. Sure. It does what I bought it to do, but I would expect a little more for $10. If you can get it on sale then it's a good game to pick up and is good for the times when you're bored and are out of games to play. It's very fun for the few hours that you'll actually play it. Although, because of the price and the lack of content, I have to give it a 6.7/10.			"

												This is the first game I've played on Steam. I rarely play any PC or console games at all. This met my hopes and expectations. I don't regret the purchase AT ALL! I will have much fun playing this classic with my family and friends. I don't like the online multi-player world but I love playing against family and friends and with this game you can do just that. I'm looking forward to doing the same thing with the golf game in my wish list, hopefully without all that upgrading clubs, equipment, clothes and skill level crap and without having to play LAN-style on separate computers in the same house like with WGT or Tiger Woods. I'm looking forward to more classic and popular modern board game adaptations becoming available too. The only thing that was a bit disappointing with this game was having to play it in the 4:3 aspect ratio. It was enjoyable enough but I would love to have it fill the screen in an update (or if I'm missing something, I would love to have someone explain to me what I'm doing wrong). A big thank-you (and a nudge and a wink) to the developers. :)			"

												Worst RIsk game ever. Had a version from ATARI I think for Win95/98, that makes this look like utter sh*t. Gameplay is crap, visuals are crap, sounds are crap. This is the definition of crap.  Also made the mistake of thinking (for some reason) that it was multiplayer and bought two copies. Stupid, stupid, Stupid. Definitely wont buy anything else from ""Sperasoft, Inc."" 20 years later, and their version of RISK is garbage compared to Risk II (Microprose, or Atari), Way too expensive on Amazon now though, unfortunately.

												This is a very basic version of this game. And nothing more. So that means:-No alternate maps-no real varriation in gameplay (except changing card redeem values).If you just want basic risk and nothing else this is fine.That being said I had these issues with this version of Risk:- 3 basic AI settings and they are all pretty easy.- The acomplishments are just basic ""Repeat this task X times""- There is nothing done to add visual interest (such as unit movement or battle animation)There are better Risk  style (not officially licensed) games that are free for mobile and pc.I think that there may be more extensive offically licenced versions of this game (I at least hope so). I found this one lacking. "

												If you're into strategy games and want the occassional quick-fix, something that has quick loading time that you can jump into and kick around for a bit then jump out, this does okay.  The format works well enough, the sound effects are fine, the blitz features helps speed things along.  If you're after Risk, here it is.  However, if you're after a quick strategy fix I will say that it has thus far struck me as having a limited feel of tactical application.  In some ways it feels like Spider Solitare -skill is only half of it, luck determines the rest.  On sale for $3 seems a fair price though.			"

												Very vanilla version of Risk to begin with.  Sure, it's cheap, but I've gotten more playable games for much cheaper.  The AIs are pretty dumb.  There's only one map.  The game crashes here and there, especially on expert level.  Also, the game's rigged.  It decides to favor the AI or you in certain situations.  It's not purely chance which I find to be a core element to the game and its outcome.So, while you may pick this version up for a low cost, and it does provide an outlet for the people without anyone to sit down with in person, I would not suggest this rendition.  If you're looking for a nice PC rendition of this classic game, continue searching elsewhere.			"

												Totally unimpressed.Currently waiting for a refund, as I can't even start the game. It appears to run, but then I can't select anything in the opening menu, it simply doesn't respond to the keyboard or mouse. My 9 minutes of ""gameplay"" was me just opening it several times and trying to get it to work.An opportunity to view it elsewhere also left me unimpressed. I played an older version while growing up and that version puts this one to shame. I do not care much about the lack of multiplayer, as I was only looking for single player with AIs, the way I used to play, anyway. But the screen is awful (the game launches in a small window, and the so called ""full screen"" is a skinny view, running down the centre and leaving at least half the screen wasted to either side. It also appears to be far less attractive overall compared to the years-old game, has a terrible AI system, a complete lack of options before starting the game, crappy sound effects, no clear battle sequence, I could go on.Hasbro should be ashamed of itself for releasing this version. It appears as if they did not care to release a game that could even be considered decent. A shame, considering how fun the original board game and computer version were.			"
