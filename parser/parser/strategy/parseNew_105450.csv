This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want to know why I recommend this game skip the Results and read from there.Age of Empires III not only lives up, but pushes forward the great series that is Age of Empires. Most people compare it as being weaker than its predecessor Age of Empires II, but I find that these people tend to not see the greatness in this game. It seems in this Age of Empires the game became more realistic, in that the Colonial Era was a point in time when no longer were kingdoms limited in wealth by the amount of gold they could mine. Instead it brings in new Cash Crops, which allow each nation to produce Gold outside of traditional methods. Campaign:This is a great game with an in-depth campaign that goes through the stories of a Scottish Explorer and his sons/daughters. The campaign is interesting and introduces different styles of gameplay from macro-managing to micro-managing with scavenging and hording. Definitely worth the play through, for Age of Empires III and Age of Empires III: War Chiefs. Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties is fun, but the campaign has nothing to do with either of the other two expansions. Gameplay:Age of Empires III offers a brilliant combat system that no longer requires precise delegation of finite resources, but allows for macro-scale battle. Allowing some players to turtle and others to expand, depending on your gameplay you can grow or stay at home. Mining gold and gathering food will always garnish better results than farming gold and food. Not only can you focus different resource harvesting strategies, but you can also use different strategies in your combat choices. You can buy mercenaries which cost only gold, or even capture native towns and create tribal units. This can allow you to vary your tactics based on your environment as well as your team. Teams:This game introduces new challenges with Teams that are complex and highly differentiated, unlike in the predecessors where each team essentially was the same as the last minus a few shifts in upgrade options and one special unit (plus two special upgrades). Age of Empires III and its two expansions offer a variety of teams which include peoples of Europe, Americas, and Asia. Age of Empires III includes the Spanish, British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, Russians, and Ottomans. Age of Empires III: War Chiefs then offer three more teams including The Aztecs, Sioux, and Iroquois. Finally Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties adds an additional three teams the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese. Hints:If you actually want to enjoy this game make sure you edit your cities in order to get all the cards, as earning all the cards takes more than one lifetime. I have owned all three of these games before they were on steam and I put over +300 hours into it still to not have one civilization at maximum level. Results:If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more. Pros:+Fun campaign with a rather interesting story (for a strategy game).+High level of variability in teams+Allowing for turtle or rushing player types+Good difficulty curve in AI (allowing boosting resource harvest rates to find the best balance of difficulty)+Each civilization is like a whole new game+On map bonuses to give reasons for exploring and moving quick across the map.+Brilliant strategy diversification with special tribal towns on each map type, and special mercenary units for each map. +Many different types of gameplay which keep the skirmishes from seeming repetitive. +Loads of cards to choose from allowing you to choose if you want to Turtle, Rush, or Support. Cons:-Leveling civilizations is rather dull (just edit the text file)-You cannot select your AI team members’ cards, which means they will just use resource cards, villagers, and soldiers (not team cards).-Some civilizations seem unbalanced. (figure it out for yourself as we all have our views on this).-Rather than producing names for the map choices they are named after states (which can be really hard to guess what type of map you will get if you're not familiar with US Geography).-You can only have two teams in skirmish mode, which is really annoying if you used to like playing 2v2v2v2. -You cannot have repeat civilizations; this means there is only one England per map.

												If you haven't heard of Age of Empires, then say hello to one of the most iconic RTS franchises. With the release of Age of Empires 2 HD Edition, there's quite a bit to go around for fans of the franchise. But enough about that, how is Age of Empire 3?Well it really depends on what you're after. Visually, it's still pretty freaking gorgeous, and it holds up quite well, though it does show its age a bit (what do you expect for an 9 year old game). the lighting effects are great, and the smoke and particle effects, especially the destructible debris that falls of buildings is a nice visual treat, and I remember how amazing it looked back in 2005, and to me it still looks great.In terms of gameplay, it feels more in line with Age of Mythology, Ensemble's previous entry, rather than Age of Empires. From the way you choose a leader each age (mirrors choosing minor deities in Age of Mythology) to general UI layout and control schemes, AoE3 feels much like a spiritual successor to Age of Mythology, with a focus on historics rather than mythos. Though with this iteration of the series,  there are new, much needed improvements. Gone is the need for a drop off point for your workers; like the Atlantean race in AoM:TT (Age of Mythology: The Titans), your workers only need to mine from the resource to generate that resource. This makes macromangement considerably less fiddly. Another change is how Caravans work in AoE3; instead of building a market, creating some caravans, and sending them to a Town Centre, there are now neutral Trading Posts that need to capture, which provide a steady steam of either Wood, Gold, Food or Experience. There are other neutral buildings the map, such as native settlements, or saloons which give you access to new units. But by far the biggest addition to the series is the Home City. The Home City has a deck of shipment cards which can be sent to you during the game, depending on how many levels you gain through experience (gained by fighting, find treasure, building or from aforementioned trade caravans). The shipments can range from dozens of cavalry soldiers, supplies of wood/gold/food,  to permanent improvements to military, defense, economy and so on. It can change how you play, and it's an interesting additon to the game.The singleplayer in the Complete Collection offers up plenty of content, with about 8 campaigns, ranging from 15th/16th Century colonials to Battle at Little Bighorn, to the Indian Revolution, and even a little bit in Japan during the Sengoku period. It has plenty of nicely realised characters, interesting stories for each campaign, and enough content for each campaign so they don't feel short. This along with the 14 civilizations you can play in singleplayer (and multiplayer, though there isnt much of a population) skirmishes means plenty of content for your money's worth. If you're new to the Age of Empires franchise or if you enjoyed Age of Mythology, then Age of Empires 3 will be a fun ride through some events through history. If you preferred Age of Empires 2, then you might not like Age of Empires 3 quite as much. For me though, its a hearty recommendation.			"

												Age of Empires III. How can one possibly begin to review a game of such magnitude and prevalence that this game holds on the gaming world? A game that, even though it has been out for over 10 years, has a large active online community? It isn’t possible, but I shall nevertheless try.This game has a rich story, which is full of interesting historical points. Even though it is fictional, it pleasantly covers the conquests of the new world. In the vanilla version and “The War Chiefs” expansion, the player can endeavour to fight against various European civilisations in order to achieve glory and fame throughout the Americas. In “The Asian Dynasties” expansion, it spans centuries of Asian colonialization by the British as well as the Japanese and the Chinese Dynasties. The gameplay is a perfect reflection of the RTS genre. You slowly build your settlement to include markets, barracks and a host of other buildings, increasing your population and army before getting ready to attack your enemy or defend your settlement. Getting the fine balance between your food, wood and coin collection can be challenging but rewarding when you get it right. Will you build a good army to begin with, or a good economy, praying that your enemy won’t attack before you’ve had chance to convert your good economy into a powerful army? Each of the units has a strength and a weakness. For example, skirmishers counter musketeers, cavalry counters skirmishers, and musketeers counter cavalry. So it’s important to get the balance right when creating your army. The new eso-community patch has nicely levelled out the civilisations, making the OP civilisations slightly less powerful and the UP civilisations slightly more powerful.Graphically, the game is simply gorgeous. Even though it’s definitely not a new game, it doesn’t feel outdated in this respect and looks magnificent from a distance (you’ll want to play fully zoomed out to maximise what you can see on the screen at all times). From buildings setting on fire and slowly crumbling as they take damage, to the glorious water reflections, to the breathtaking bloom effects, you’ll be wondering whether it was actually made in 2005, or 2015.The music is purely divine. I’m listening to it as I type this as it’s one of my favourite game original soundtracks of all time. As your colony grows into a mighty empire the soundtrack seamlessly transitions from slow, peaceful renaissance/discovery era, to the powerful and more rhythmic late game, mimicking the chugging of steam engines and factories as you journey into the industrial age.Overall, a stunning game. If you haven’t ever played it, buy it and experience it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.			"

												 I remember playing this game as a child. I would come home every day hoping that my brother wasnt playing so i could play. The game only got more fun. I only had the original game and no DLCs so when i saw this game on steam 8 years later, it was obvious that i had to buy it. If you havnt played this game yet, i acctually feel bad for you.10/10 Would ""Tuck tuck tuck"" again.			"

												Pros: Excellent strategy game for its time and still today. In general, much more refined and fun gameplay compared to previous AoEs with more of an emphasis on combat, rather than micromanaging villagers. Still has decent graphics even by today's standards.Cons: The French.11/10 would buy again.			"

												Age of Empires makes a comeback by jumping forward to the Imperial Era. Cannons, muskets, armed cavalries, large vessels and more cannons present a change of pace from the old sword-and-shield Age of Empires II. The third instalment of the franchise also introduces trading routes, a set of locations that you have to capture and control by building trading posts on it, reinforcing your income and XP gain. You can order shipments of goods from your mainland at intervals of time and befriend local indigenous tribes.In a sense, there are plenty of new features to keep long time fans of Age of Empires interested, while retaining the same core gameplay. Build stuff, gather stuff, advance Ages, kill baddies. Only this time, with more cannons.			"

												I am a big fan of the AOE series, and history. This game is brilliant, although the AI may be silly at times *cough, Napolean* it still has unique gameplay and good graphics, as well a Pretty decent uprgade system. I loved the fact that different units would take up a certain amount of population, e.g. A dragoon would take up 2 population where as the a musketeer would take up 1. There is a huge variety of map choices and with the Asian dynasties pack and The war cheifs DLC, the selection choices are endless, they vary from the Amazon River, The Andes, Anywhere in the US and even the Great silk road in Asia. Best feature for me? The Expansion Packs were actually expansions that changed the game in multiple ways and added on to the complete/full base form of the game. normally DLC nowadays is required to get the full package of what the final product should've been. AoE3's Expansion Packs ARE NOT DLC. The Expansion Packs in AoE3 add on to the game content enough to make it feel like a different game within a game. The Expansion Packs aren't neccessary to fully enjoy Age of Empires III; however, having them improves upon the player experience greater.If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more.			"

												A fine installation in the Age of Empires series that has a greater emphasis on combat as well as teaching you about things other than human resource management and medieval history lessons. Instead, you will gain a deep knowledge of zoology and learn how to beat up people and steal their stuff.General:>Zoology Lessons – Some things you will learn: Capybaras and tapirs live in Central and South America, Ibex, Saigas, and Marco Polo sheeps live in central Asia, Serows live in Japan and the rest of Asia.>Japanese Daimyos can materialize samurai out of thin air.>Shogun Tokugawa is a wizard that can open portals to other worlds and summon the likes of monks with clubs, shinobi that shoot grenades using their bows, and entire artillery companies.>The original American Continental Marines were an army of Japanese Ronin Samurai mercenaries.>If you throw a lot of torches into a building, it will not burn. However, it will break apart and then finally explode.>Native American fire pit dances generate magic that they put to use in battle, putting Warcraft spellcasters to shame.>Medicine men, surgeons, and priests all perform the same healing magic.>Even standing near an idle monster truck could be lethal.>Even before the creation of the United States, George Washington always knew he’d end up on both the quarter and the dollar bill.>As an Asian power, you can ally with your enemy through the consulate… and still wage war with their forces with soldiers from their own home country.>Chinese flamethrowers never burn anything, they just kill it and blow it up.>The British employed the use of longbowmen well into the 1800s.>Cuauhtemoc of the Aztecs is a cool guy; he has a blood fetish and refers to himself in third person.>Queen Isabella so desperate, she’ll sleep with Cuauhtemoc>Akbar of the Indians is worse than a fervent Jehovah’s Mormon as he constantly attempts to convert you to his religion (Hinduism) while beating him up. On the bright side, he can’t nuke you like Gandhi.>Russian strelets are a gift from the Aztec blood gods.>Russian strelets are equipped with large foam axes and airsoft muskets.>Created an Iroquois home city called Toronto, named the warchief Rob Ford. He smoked crack, befriended blowgunners and blew up his own city.>As another reviewer simply noted, you can beat up monkeys and steal their money.>The Haitians hoped that their new ironclad warships would be their knights in shining armor. They turned out to be their morons in aluminum foil.>The story of the original Thanksgiving is full of lies, propagated by the capitalist pigs in Washington. The true story goes as follows. In 1603, Shogun Tokugawa wanted to construct a new shogunate palace. He sent a group of Japanese pilgrims across the ocean. A few years later, they landed on Plymouth in New England, an excellent place for a new shogunate palace. There, they befriended a native scout and his pet intrepid scout turkey. Shortly thereafter, a group of allied Chinese pilgrims came ashore and set up shop alongside them. The Japanese and Chinese came together for a great turkey dinner. HOWEVER… The French and the Ottomans landed around the same time and did not take kindly to what they saw as encroachment upon their lands. A great war ensued in which the Chinese and Japanese ultimately prevailed. In the end, a great Thanksgiving feast was held in the new shogunate palace with Tokugawa as the host.>SPECIAL EDIT: Indestructable outposts

												Still better than Age of Empires 2.Strike one for imperialism.Looks nice, sounds nice, cannons are a great feature, has a working online service, trading cards, steam hours counting, *breathes*, all the DLC you might have missed in the old days, great 3-tiered base campaign which follows a families lineage. Takes place in the times of exploration, which is a nice departure from ancient times.The simplification of some game features were hit or miss, some were niceties, others just are too simple. An example of one that was a miss was the removal of individual farm squares, and collection buildings, although it can be assumed that it is automated, it still seems too simple.Has a nice variety of units, although, the crossbowmen seem kind of weaksauce when I got Janissaries with guns and cannons so big they can be used for artillery. Its let hack and slash, blow for blow of some other strategy games, and more so the style of ""you mess up, you just might die"".Price is a little on the high side however, and if you can get it cheaper than $40, I would whole heartidly recommend it.

There are many nations to play, each with their own special units. a real time stradegy game where you upgrade through the ages, offering better units and upgrades. You can fight with humans or with computer players. The best part of the game by far is the battles. Huge battles with infantry, calvary and cannons, War will be every where and dead bodies will rittle the bafflefied. A must play if you like RTS games			"

												Though many people say AOE2 is the best in the franchise, I actually think AOE3, with the abundance of exotic civs from 2 expansions and unofficial mods, has surpassed that timeless classic.Graphics: AOE3 looks great at distance, even up to today's standards. That's mainly due to the excellent using of lighting effects (shades and HDR), the textures and animation on a closer look however, are on the same level as Age of Mythology (kinda obvious they used the same engine), which is a little bit dated. But it doesn't hurt at all, for some of the best RTS games like SupCom and COH aren't beautiful up close either.Sound: Soundtracks are awesome, definitely the best in the franchise and probably one of the best in the whole genre. I especially love the track of revolution event, it pumps me up so much that I want to punch a freaking baby in the face. Sound effects are even more impressive, more so the sound of canons. God how I love the sound of canon fire in this game, every shot is like the mixture of bass solo and Morgan Freeman monologue coming out of a subwoofer. Pure heaven.Gameplay: Quite different from the previous games. The tempo has been speeded up a bit. Range attack becomes the mainstream and melee the sidekick. Resources are down to 3, which I think is acceptable. Civs feel very distinct from each other especially those from different continents. Balance is marginally okay, with 3 pretty OP civs and same amount of trench tier ones. Many new features like homecity and card deck building are actually great fun and add a lot to the strategic depth. Online games are quite stable and smooth, and usually end in stomping.Mods: I love the mod Napoleonic Era to death. This along with another mod called The War of the Triple Alliance make me rate this game among top 3 RTS on my list. Holy crap the additional civs and features are mindblowing. I really wish for 2 things, that we will one day get Steam Workshop for AOE3 and one day the devs of these two mods be contracted by Microsoft to combine the mods into an official expansion, just like The Forgotten to AOE2. Community: Friendly, steady, small in size but alive. That's all I can say.Conclusion: Don't let nostalgia get the best of you. AOE3 is different from AOE2, but in a good way.			"

												My opinion on every AOE is almost the same. I absolutely love these types of games. I enjoy building and training a growing army then completely smashing everyone else (unless they are better than me huhuhuhu) but honestly AOE III is a bit graphic outdated now but it’s still an amazing game for it being released in 2005. Recommendation: Absolutely.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games and won't mind a bit less graphics then the newer games.			"

												Do you like video games? Do you like RTSs? Do you like not having to have 300 apm to keep a constant stream of resources coming in? Then you will like AoE 3. If you don't go hardcore or of Asian descent and play strategy games like a casual (like me) then you will also like this game. What I mean is that the macro from Age of Empires II was VERY watered down in AoE 3. Sure you still need some form of it like all RTSs, but the amount has dropped very much so. And I LOVE gunpowder units. Nothing is more satisfying then seeing 100+ musketiers poppin caps in each other like this is Chicago. The addition of Home City shipments is another feature that I like. Basically you choose around 20 shipments (they are cards that you put into a deck and you pick new cards everytime you level your home city) gain experience from various actions and once you accumulate enough you gain the ability to call in a shipment to your town center. Cards are also Age related and most can only be used once. The cards can range from calling in military units, villagers, economic shipments and buildings, and upgrades for many different things. And some cards affect all your allies. There is a lot of different strats you can go with a deck.As I mentioned earlier you have Home Cities for each civ. Basically when you first start the game you choose which Civilization you want to be, then you choose your home city name and your explorer name ( you can put any name you want for both, great feature ) then you go into a game. You gain exp as you finish games, gaining levels for your city. Then you can unlock new cards. Some cards are locked until later levels ( it goes something like 10>25>40 I think) but from what I have since they aren't that much better, still useful though. If you want to play a different civ you have to make another home city for them and can also name that anything you want, along with the explorer, starting back at level one ( Unless you play the DLC, for some odd reason you start at level 10 with 10 unlocks. So just play the Asian DLC since it has everything for the other one and the base game.) Each Civ has different cards available at the start and to unlock although about half are universal.Onto the gameplay it is mostly the same as AoE 2. With the addition of Trade Routes and Native camps (which supply extra resources and unlocks special respectively) it adds some degree of map control. There probably was already map control on AoE 2 but I know little of how the meta is for it. If there was I'm sure trade routes and native camps add even more since the extra resources are a huge bonus ( They start off giving only Exp and can be upgrade 3 times with the last being a train, another feature I like. And the free exp is HUGE to getting early home shipment points) and natives can harass early on. Natives also don't add to pop limit but you can only train a certain amount. Having more than half of all the trade posts and native camps gives you the option to start a Trade monopoly victory, which gives you victory in 5 minutes if they don't destroy any trade posts/native camps, helps if the enemy is turtling hard. You also can only build one castle and thats from a shipment you get (Russians can build more I believe). And if the wagon it starts off as gets destory you don't get another. Stone was also removed as a resource. Also, cannons and muskets. Pretty much the two man things you will build, or at least for me. Still plenty of archers, cavalry, swordmen, pikemen, etc. A lot of civs have more than one special unit, and they aren't built from the castle only. The population cap is set at 200 and that has mixed feelings but I'm fine with it. The graphics are great even though I run it on low. Haven't played the campaign nor the multiplayer, just skirmishs.Overall, a great game and a must buy for any RTS fan. Even if it is slightly watered down from AoE 2 the new additions to it and time setting are amazing, great gameplay, and good graphics.40 dollars though? Damn, definitely worth at at any sales price, but who even buys triple A games over 30? Still worth it at 40.			"

												The original Age of Empires packed a stunning visual punch and backed it up with solid gameplay. Back at a time where most strategy games were chunky and 2D, the first Age game pulled aside the curtain to reveal a world that was sunny, animated, colorful and lifelike. Strategy games were never the same. Age of Empires III presents a similar leap forward for real-time strategy fans. As Half-Life 2 did for first-person shooters, AoE III shows just how inspiring these games can be when lovingly crafted with outstanding artistry and solid gameplay fundamentals. Age of Empires III doesn't redefine real-time strategy gameplay. You're still scurrying to collect more resources than your opponents and rushing to field a giant army, and the game still rewards frantic clicking and unit management. But the presentation is unmatched, and even though the game is rooted in RTS conventions, there are enough new elements and strategic variations here to addict even grizzled veterans. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this game out. And if you've never played a real-time game before, this is the place to start.Graphically, the engine that powers Age of Empires III has a laundry list of the latest graphics technology: real-time shadows, high dynamic range lighting, you name it. There's even bump-mapping on the barrels of the cannons. But the real impressive thing about the technology isn't that it's there, it's that you don't notice it. From the moment your Home City first appears on the menu screen, or a new map loads up to reveal pale grey waters lapping quietly against rocky New England shores, you become lost in the game world. The latest in technology is coupled with truly beautiful art.Age III pulls out all the stops to depict the sweeping majesty of the old west or the unspoiled beauty of the colonial-era Americas. One of the single-player campaign cutscenes, done in the game engine, pans across rolling hills of golden grass while huge herds of buffalo amble along like waves of water. Another level depicts a small Caribbean port picking up the pieces after a devastating hurricane, with citizens milling about amidst wrecked ships and broken docks. Yet another level has you picking your way through a dense swamp looking for the ruins of Spanish treasure ships half-buried in the mud and dripping with gold doubloons. You're never lacking for eye candy.The music is equally impressive. Done in full orchestra, it moves effortlessly from majestic scores highlighting the beauty of the landscape to pounding battle drums accenting the fury of battle. Of course, the combat is equally spectacular. The goal of the game is to devastate your opponents, and said devastation is accompanied by deeply satisfying images of destruction. A large part of this has to do with the real physics incorporated onto the game engine. You can feel the impact when a cannonball shatters into a wooden frontier building, breaking it into pieces that fly off in macabre arcs. Smoke billows from muskets, cannons leap back as they expel their fury, building spires burst into flame and collapse into themselves, and the masts of ships crash to the deck as the vessel shudders with the impact of enemy fire. Every game of Age of Empires III drips with spectacle.Age III simulates colonization, meaning that the town you build in the game can request ""shipments"" from your Home City. You gain new shipments by earning experience, and you have a set list of things that you can send over. This has a profound impact on your strategy. Do you send over economic resources early, to give your town a leg up on the competition? Or do you send over tons of military units, so that you can field an advanced army while your neighbors are still building up? Shipments add a lot to the game by giving you more strategic possibilities, and by giving you incentive to rapidly earn experience. They really reward players for going out and making things happen around the map. Every map is also dotted with Native American villages or trade routes that can be built up by your colony. Controlling a trading post gives you free experience or resources whenever a trade cart comes by, whereas Native American villages can provide you with inexpensive military units or technology upgrades. Controlling these points on the map gives you a major edge over the long term. As a result, it's a rush to be the first to locate these points, and they are always hotly contested. Battles usually play out as a series of skirmishes across the map before big conflicts rage at the town centers.Finally, Age of Empires III adds the ""Home City"" concept. Outside of the real-time portion of the game, you can create a Home City representing the world power that's supplying your colonies. Your Home City has a level - like an RPG character - representing how experienced it is. As you earn experience playing the game your city will ""Level up"" and you can choose new abilities for it, in effect deciding what kinds of shipments you'd like to send to your colonies. The decision about what kinds of upgrades to make to your city is agonizing and has a tangible impact on the main game. It's also fun just to level up, develop, and customize your own personal city. One nice side effect here is that, even if you get totally♥♥♥♥♥whupped in a multiplayer game, you probably still earned a lot of experience to use to develop your city. This concept works great all around and really contributes to the game.The single-player campaign is divided into three acts representing three generations of the same family. Picking up where Age of Kings left off, the lead character in the first campaign is a Knight adventuring in the New World in search of a lost treasure. Said treasure impacts his whole family line, as depicted in Act II, a rip-roaring Davy-Crockett style adventure starring his Grandson. Act III picks up two generations later, featuring a wild west romp involving railroads, the Mexican war, and a quest into the Amazon jungles before the family finally finds closure. As with the other production values of the game, the writing is solid and the voice acting is great. There's a good variety of missions in the single-player campaign, from protecting a stronghold until help arrives to building a railroad line to battling pirates along a series of islands. None of the individual scenarios have you doing things that hadn't been done in other RTS games, but the real magic is in the gameplay, which allows you to develop a different Home City for each act and tackle each scenario differently. Truly hardcore strategy gamers might find lots of nitpicks in Age of Empires III. It's difficult to unload transport ships, healers have to be micro-managed or they'll charge into combat, and there aren't a lot of options for customizing your hotkeys. Artillery units on occasion can't decide to fire or pack up to move. But the important thing is that none of these little problems really impacts the core game. Age of Empires III is an absolutely fantastic title with superb graphics and tight gameplay. Single-player or multiplayer, no matter what your skill, you'll get hours of joy out of this sucker online or off. Age of Empires III may not redefine real-time strategy gaming, but it sets the bar so high that we'll be comparing games to this for years. Shoulder your musket and pony up: this one's a real trip.

												Age of Empires III is criticized for being not a good follow-up to AoE II. I don't fully understand the criticism. I prefer the colonial-era setting of AoE III much more than the medieval one of II. The skirmish mode of AoE III results in roughly 45-75 minute games, which is great for short bursts of gaming. It's a great way to unwind and is an engaging game that has stood the test of time.			"

												I own two coppies of AOE3, that's just how great of a game it is.Between my retail copy and my steam copy I'd have nearly 1000 hours played.Positives: ""Card Deck Tech Tree"" Allows you to select up to 35 technologies that are unlocked based on your XP in the match. The abillity to name your Explorer and Homecity. City leveling and user leveling adds noticeable multiplayer progression. Tradepost [specified spots on the map allow you to build a tradepost  for extra resources, units and technologies offering a bit of a King Of The HIll feel].Negatives: No diplomacy [unless a custom scenario], only 3 team options [FFA, 1 or 2], no capturing enemy units/technologies [in previous games you could use your priest/monk to convert enemies to your team].

												Age of Empires 3Genre: Strategy - Real Time StrategyRating: 10/10Personal playing period: 5+ yearsIs it worth a buy: Yes. Even at full price. This is a necessity for any strategy players collection.Girl vs Game: Unless it's some super model I'd definately rather play the Game.Personal Comment:This is an amazing game with endless amounts of game time. The hours on here isnt a fraction of my actual game time online and offline. Been playing this game since the day it was released and still play it and love it today. I even missed a couple of meals as well as toilet breaks playing this believe it or not. I have bladder and bowel control of a ninja thanks to AOE.Online gaming:The online gaming community is still very active and people of all skill levels are on it. You will find anywhere between 500 to 2000 people online at any given time. Beware though that even though AOE is helpful and awesome the online community are sometimes a bunch of cocktonsil nimrod supremists who think they're amazing whilst never having seen or felt a girl up close unless in a magazine. But if your skin is thick and you dont give a flying **** about other people you'll be fine.Short Summary:This is a real time strategy game that plays off in the medieval times. There are 8 standard civilizations, 3 native indian civilizations and 3 Asian civilizations. Each civ provides a different set of advantages and it takes time to learn how to utilise the various civs to their full capability. Learning each civilisation takes time and it is great fun doing that. There are countless amounts of maps that allow for the use of different strategies. The game also has a story rich single player campaign. I have not played the campaign yet but never felt the need to as the standard game modes offer more than enough fun and game time.The game also has progressive improvement meaning the more you play the more items get unlocked and the stronger your civilisation becomes. This ensures that you want to play more and more in order to improve the strength of your favourite civilisation.Learning Curve and Gameplay:Easy to start but tough to master. The learning curve to start playing and learning the basics is very easy. Learning the various civilisations and their strengths is more challenging and may take a lot of practice and time. The gameplay is very simplistic in it being a basic RTS with click and place. Gathering of basic resources and using those resources are easy and self explanotary. A tutorial can be played to understand the basics but this game is very playable and a new player will get it after playing only for a few hours.			"

												A game from back when RTS games were still riding high, when ""base building"" wasn't a dirty word and factions were meant to be colourful and fun.  It shows its age now, but the core mechanics are still solid.An unusual characteristic of an RTS was persistency; or how your play affected you in the next game.  AOE III had experience gain over time that would unlock ""cards"", which then could be called into play in a future match.  This also came with nice cosmetic upgrades for a ""capital"" city, which let players really feel that they were leading an army into battle.  Sadly these cosmetic upgrades were not in place for Asian or American civilizations in the expansions, although the persistant card unlocks are still present.The factions are nicely done.  The European factions all largely play the same, with some emphasis on artillery, cavalry, or infantry between them.  Asian civilizations are also fairly similar, just implementing ""wonders"" as well as other minor changes.  I do like the emphasis on the Americans, who end up playing much more differently as they lack the hard defenses that others do.  Overall these different factions make for a high level of replayability.An old game, but worth the money.  Especially since newer quality RTSs are infrequent.			"

Posted: November 16, 2014
												Well, a third part for Age of Empires. What to expect of it?If you have never played the first two parts of AoE, here you'll get a little summary: Age of Empires I and II were defining new standards for the RTS-genre when they came out. Not as fast-paced as Starcraft or WarCraft, but with more strategical Depth and more focus on the organization of your camp and with a build-in history-part wich made the game even a little educational without decreasing the fun of the gameplay. You always could choose from many different cultures which had some units and technology in common, but some unique units and cultural advantages and disadvantages.Now, what is different in AoE III?First of all, after AoE I playing in antique times and AoE II playing in Medieval times up to the discovery of the new world, AoE III consequently plays in times of the colonization of America and the civil war. Like AoE I & II, AoE III contains many true historical events, locations and persons, but unlike both prequels, the main storyline of the campaigns is highly fictional so that it might be difficult to tell which events in the game truely happend and which are made up. The main storyline of the campaign is about a sect which tries to find and conquer the fountain of youth in the new world and a family which is bound by fate to stop them. On their journeys they encounter many historical persons like Georg Washington or Bolivar, but most of the game is about hunting down the sect. So the game is far less educational then the previous ones.The second big difference is that the cultures do not longer have most techs and units in common but every nation has their own tech tree. Some things of course still are open to every culture but the differences between the cultures are far bigger then before. This isn't much of a problem because you can still tell the strengths and weaknesses of an unfimilar unit very fast, but it is more difficult then before to play a new nation.And the there are the RPG-elements. Not only do you have imortal hero-units (like in Age of Mythology) which can only be knocked unconscious and stand up again if no more enemy units are around, you will also play random maps with a ""hometown"" which can level up between games and send you support if you collect enough experience by surviving a certain time, killing enemy units or building your camp. Although this may increase the motivation to play more random maps they removed the option to play a random culture, which I really loved in AoE I & II.The AIs are weaker then in AoE II which is good for beginners but a little disappointing for more expert players. The balancing is also worse. There are some strategies to break the game. A pack of at least 20 osman heavy bombards, for example, is almost invincible. No AI-player ever was able to beat me if I got that far.With the complete Collection, you will also get the two Add-Ons: The War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties.The War Chiefs adds playable Native American Tribes (Without this Add-On they are only available as some sort of mercenaries if you build trading posts near their villages witch appear randomly on random maps). Although playing a native american culture is a very wellcome change and a challenge, it is clearly unbalanced. Those cultures are given many new and unique techniques like sending settlers to a totem and dance to do rites which give you advantages like faster ressources or stronger soldiers, they still desperatly lack heavy siege weaponary. Native american soldiers are only strong in large nummers and will have to attack early to not get overwhelmed by superior firepower of other nations.The Add-On also adds two campaigns which complete the storyline of the original game campaign by filling gaps and finishing the somehow open story. The focus, of course, is more on the war of the native americans against the europeans and so it is no true surprise that you will have to face general Custer at wounded Knee. Still the two new campaigns are much more shallow...The Asian Dynasties finally adds some civilizations from Asia like the Indians and the Chinese. The storyline of the new campaigns has nothing to do with the story of the original campaign. The Indian campaign for example takes place around the fight for independence in India and the chinese campaign describes the discovery of the american continent by a chinese admiral which might have taken place (or maybe not) long before Columbus was born.Overall AoE III: Complete Collection is a decent RTS game with some unique features, but if you were a big fan of AoE I & II you might be disappointed because it is a really different game then what you are used to. Still it is worth a try.If you have never played AoE I or II, but you like RTS games, you should definitly try this one.			"

												A follow up to the 2'nd Age of Empires that everyone loved. Among many this game is not so good, some things were simplified, such as gathering resources - now there are 3 instead of 4 of them and your villagers don't have to come back to the lumberjack or the city centre to store them. Many smaller tweaks and adjustments, and of course a heavy focus on musket fights, artillery and the transition from Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution and father away into the 19'th Century. It's a shame that there weren't any additional elements added to the Steam release of the game. Controls being one of the more touchy ones. For instance, to change the hotkeys you need to manually go through each tab. There is also no Steam Cloud, but they did add Trading Cards so that's one interesting thing to look forward to.This game is soon to have 10 years after it's release. But this edition is by far the best one yet. You get all the expansions. Working multiplayer with a community that still lives. And of course that same old strategy many remember and honor as ""one of the best"". The modest presentation of it's ancestors passed away. I'd say that the magnificence of the soundtrack itself says a lot:

												Good points of Age of Empires III:Good unit diversity: Each civ has a core of units semi-unique to them, making each one feel different enough that playing the Germans doesn't feel like a playing a reskin of the British, or vice versa. For the ""European Civs"" (I put that in quotes because while the Ottoman Turks are not from Europe at all, they play like one of the other European civs), that diversity is actually rather subtle, with each civ having one or two units totally unique to them, as well as a couple semi-universal units that are their ""Best Units"", which get special high-tier upgrades. For example, while the Spanish get Hussars, like the British, the British can upgrade them to ""Kingsguard"" Hussars, while the Spanish just get regular ""Guard"" Hussars. The distinction is rather intuitive; basically, if a unit gets a special name once it hits its second upgrade, it'll be better in some way than a unit that doesn't. In this way, the European civs harken back, somewhat, to Age of Empires II, which had each civ only have one or two unique units. On the other hand, each of the Native American and Asian civs are completely different, with entirely different units and even different mechanics, and which units each civ is best with is fairly obvious a few minutes into playing them. The diversity is further enhanced with mercenary units available from the home city and native american units from trading posts.Good story campaigns: I can't quite make this point without clarification. The first three campaigns were not that great. Those were the pre-expansion ones, and frankly, the series had really stopped working out those storytelling muscles it had in Age of Empires II. The action often felt disjointed and rushed, with the endings of each of the three campaigns being the only bits that seemed to matter or have any impact. However, all of that said, the latter five campaigns were actually quite good, especially if you could disengage them from the taint of their predecessors in terms of tropes and pacing. In addition, the characters personal struggles in the latter five campaigns were more apparent, their inner struggles seemed to mean so much more. Really, if you want a great story, the latter five campaigns are pretty damn good.Good* Mechanics: This game has some rather... mixed mechanics. I'll get to the bad later, but for now, the good news! The home city is the big thing that was touted on release, and frankly, I like the concept a lot. It allows a player to gain advantages specific to their strategy, whether it be resource gathering, naval dominance, or raw military power. Essentially, the way the Home City works is that the player assigns cards to a deck, each card representing a batch of units or an upgrade or some resources. When a home city shipment is available in game, the player selects one of the cards they've assigned, and after a brief waiting period (Hey, it takes time to get a Declaration to Claim the New World overseas. Cut them some slack.), the units, tech, etc. arrives. In addition to this as one of the primary mechanics, you've got your normal suite of resource gathering (done with villager-type units) and military unit production. An interesting nuance of the unit production here is that when you've got a military building selected, let's say, the Barracks, and let's say you want to train a sqaud of Musketeers. You can shift-click the unit portrait to train five at once. While this may not seem novel by itself; a few games already allow this sort of thing, the novel thing is that doing it this way makes the waiting period for your units slightly longer, but you get all five units at once. The Russians and Chinese have this as their primary mechanic, with the Russians training ""blocks"" of infantry, and the Chinese creating ""Banner Armies"" which are groups of various unit combinations. Overall, the mechanics are decent in most respects. In addition, the game very cleverly and subtley hampers rushing, which was a brutal, and often severely effective tactic in Age of Empires II, by making it so that the player cannot send units from the home city, or even train them, until the second technological era. I hardly ever notice that my efforts at building an army are being hampered by this restriction, but when I do notice it, I am appreciative of the clever design choice.Bad points of Age of Empires III:Bad* Mechanics: As I said, this game has some mixed mechanics. Now we come to the bad. The primary problem we have here is that while the home city, is in concept, a nice idea with some potential for strategic use, it seems best used as a rush enabler. Earlier, I mentioned that the game restricts rushing by limiting military units to the second age and following. But the home city can easily be stocked with military unit shipments so that come second era, you can get an entire army, virtually free of charge. Here's a hot tip for those cheese players out there: Get the best second-era military unit shipments you can. Then, in game, save up your shipments. Once you get to age II, build a Church. Then research Mercantilism, which gets you around 3 shipments for 1,000 Coin. Then, in essence, spawn a horde of troops. Admittedly, this really only works for the European civs, but the overwhelming potential for early-midgame rush is still somewhat staggering, and it means that some of the more interesting home city shipments may not ever see play. In addition, many games, it seems, are decided well before the final technological era. The reasons for this are two-fold: A) Reaching that final era and researching all the upgrades is simply prohibitively expensive, and B) It just makes more sense to strike your enemy before then, fatally, if possible. This makes the late-game content feel a little unnecessary, as you're probably already winning if you can research that final era, and if you're not winning, spending 4,000 food and coin isn't going to make things that much better. The game does mitigate this somewhat, by having a ""Revolution"" feature, an alternative to the final age-up, which turns all your villager-type units into militia-type units, and also gives you a plethora of new military options for your civ. However, if you're far ahead enough that you can forgo economy entirely, than you probably don't need the feature anyway. Also, it's only available to European civs, so the final age cost problem is still relevant to Asian and Native American civs. Also, unit counters and stats can be difficult to wrap one's head around, as the developers saw fit to give the player the literal math used to determine unit stats. For example, I believe the movement speed for the average footsoldier was 7.25. Not 7, not 8, but a fraction, 7.25. While this may not seem like a major issue, throwing numbers like that at a player makes the game feel less than polished, and also degrades the meaning of the numbers themselves. 7.25 what? And what does it mean when my Musketeer deals 8 damage, but the Hussar it's attacking has 0.20 armor? Does it deflect 0.20 damage? Or 20% damage? The game doesn't tell you, meaning you'll have to examine the numbers closely to determine exact impact of your units against your opponents.Anachronism: While I will be the first to admit that anachronism in a strategy game isn't that huge an issue, and is in fact, almost to be expected in these kinds of games, the situation here is rather glaring. Granted, the problem is bigger in the first three story campaigns, and I wouldn't mind it quite so much if it were restricted to the game itself only. But c'mon. Having Revolutionary War era musketeers accompany Amelia Black, a railroad owner? And having them in full garb in cutscene? That's the sort of thing that stretches disbelief to the breaking point, and was one of the reasons that those campaigns did not match the quality of the latter five.Overall Review: It's pretty good. Steam's char. limits are♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This is a very solid game. I was expecting this game to be absolutely awful, however, in playing it and completing all three campaigns on normal in about 19 hours, it was an enjoyable game. The campaign is above-average, and the variety of the campaign is solid, yet it can become repeatitive, in my opinion.The AI is very solid, they act like they know what to do. This, with the gameplay, cooperates and makes it a very fun experience for strategy gamers because the gameplay, is as normal with Age of Empire series, is great.The graphics are dated, however they are not all that bad.People still play multiplayer, and MP is very fun, as it has modded modes, to just normal gameplay, so the community is not dead.Overall, I would recommend this game to any strategy fan. The overall experience is worth the price tag.8/10.----Thanks for reading my review!

												The game gives rather different experience than Age of Empires II, it's much more faster paced, the natural resources are limited, but you can get farms, plantiations and factories that produces them in unlimited amount. Also, you can capture trade outposts that allow you to get more experience needed for shipment's (which give additional units, resources or upgrades for your nation). Which those changes you are able to fight for longer, have bigger battles and in exchange - have more fun.The unit combat is really sweet and enjoyable, mixing various types of units gives an edge in the battle, which means that spam blobs can be easily defeated if played right.The game is well balanced, even with weakest nation you are able to defeat any other nation,and if meele combat is your kink, you can have a lot of fun here.The only con is that camera position is really really close to your units, and you can change it just by a little bit, which might be irritating, and when you alt+tab the sound options reset's so you have to change them again.Also, there is a lot of problems with multiplayer if you want to play via lan, which I still didnt figured out.

												Age of Empires 3. An amazing RTS taking place in the ""New World"" during the colonial age. Great game play that keeps you entertained for hours, continuously coming back wanting more!Pros:-Great game play, keeping you entertained for hours. -Has funny and entertaining cheats, like ""tuck tuck tuck"" which allows you to spawn in a huge monster truck. That will drive over anyone or anything, creating global havoc. -Has a large supply of maps, each map making you have to adjust your strategic plans to win. -You get all the DLC's, adds more to the game, civilizations, maps and more!Cons:-Dying online community and online support, servers can get high amounts of lag. Servers will go offline sometimes even for an entire day. -Franchise has been disbanded, meaning no more support. No updates, no fixing current glitches. -Population cap reaches only 200, meaning that your stuck fighting smaller battles. I would purchase this game on sale, it's worth to get the game. Just not at full price.Overall I will give an overall positive review: 8.3/10			"

												Age of Empires 3 (AOE3) will always be my favourite RTS of all time. I have played this game since 2008 and on my disc copy (actually 3 disc copies lol) I would say I have played around 1500 hours or so total.The Campaign: The campaign is not a hugely different playstyle from skirmish or multiplayer but it allows you to feel more like you're involved with the people and characters than usual which definitely makes the campaign worth playing through. Each expansion has a separate campaign and I remember them being highly entertaining and interesting each to their own. The campaigns also allow you to use civs not playable in any other game mode.Map Editor: Not something I played around with too much, but it was fun to just create giant battles, or create your own scenarios and historical events.Civilizations: The civilizations are really interesting. So interesting, that my interest in European, Native American, and Asian history are based from this game. I play this game as an excuse for studying for my history tests but I can't say that it helped with much more than trivia-like questions. Anyways, This game makes every civilization slightly different from each other (The War Chiefs and Asians are much different respectifully though) and every one is recognizable by not only building styles but troops as well. Each nation is given at least one troop that is unique to their civ. In the original there is 8 European nations (Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Ottoman Empire) with War Chiefs, 3 Native American tribes were added (Iroquois, Sioux, Aztec) allowing 11 total playable nations, and finally with Asian Dynasties, 3 more were added (Japan, China, India), with a total of 14 playable civilizations . Apart from the 3 civs that are just a little bit better than the rest (You'll know soon enough), it is pretty balanced when playing online (IF playing with someone with similar experience).Multiplayer: AOE3 was slowly getting weaker with age a few years back but with the game being more widely sold on steam, I feel the community has a chance to bounce back. Usually when I go on, there are anywehre from 600 - 1000 people on at a time. This doesn't count the community that play on places like GameRanger and other programs like it. Don't get discouraged by people baiting new players into their games when they are veteran players. Host a game and name it something welcoming new players, read the ranks of the people who join, to make sure the game will be fair and welcoming to you if you are new. Or join another low ranked players game or grab a buddy or two and practice between you all. I would recommend being able to beat Hard or Expert computers before playing online, but of course, it is your choice. Multiplayer is the best place to play, practice, and have a competitive and some-what stressful game of AOE3. :)Graphics: Honestly, in my opinion, the graphics are spectacular for their time and do not look anywhere near ""bad"" even in today's time. Of course they aren't great for today's standards but they aren't awful enough to turn you away. I actually find them quite nice and I am more than satisfied watching the ships travel the oceans, or seeing the parrots flying through the rainforests. The loading screens are really nice too, all 3 games have different styles. For example in Asian Dynasties there is one loading screen with the Indian Emperor riding on an elephant with the troops behind them. Or the Japanese loading screen with the beautiful Torii Gates. In War Chiefs, one screen is the Aztec emperor on top of a temple with his arms up with the people looking up to him from the ground. This game sparks not only interest, but imagination, its amazing!Soundtrack: The soundtrack is phenominal! I absolutely love the theme song of each game and I find myself testing my opera skills most times I play this game. The music is great, intense, and is fitting to the epic introduction to the game or the conclusion to the massive multiplayer game you just finished.Opening: The opening to each expansion has a really cool video based on the game. The War Chiefs has the European explorers searching the forest and them being ambushed by the Native troops. It's epic, and amazing to watch from time to time before jumping into the game! I recommend watching all 3 intros so I'll let you watch to find out what they're like!Extra Features: Unlike previous installments to the franchise (AOE1, AOE2, Age of Mythology), AOE3 introduces cards, card decks, city levels, city customization, explorer naming, and city naming. Cards can be purchased by leveling up. One level is one card unlock point. A deck can have I think 21 cards to start, and with every ten level ups, can have an extra card in the deck. Cities level up by playing with them, and EXP is given for every building or troop made, or enemy building or troop destroyed. Cities can be customized by upgrading the buildings, such as France's Notre Dam by changing colours, adding features, etc. A minor touch but still interesting enough to have your own sort of style with leading a nation in the game. Your explorer can be named so you can make yourself, a friend, or family member be the greatest European explorer, Native American War Chief, Japanese Shogun, Indian Brahmin, or Chinese Master that has ever existed. The same goes for cities, you can name them the small rural town you live in, or your country's capital city and make it the most advanced city in the world! All theses extra features expand upon the replayability and fun that you can have with AOE3. Note, AOE3 - The Asian Dynasties expansion was the latest released and updated. All Civs can be played on this expansion and the majority of the people play on this one. I suggest only playing the original AOE3 and War Chiefs when playing with campaign, or really dislike playing with or against the Asian Civs as they cannot be played in the others.Also, check out Age of Mythology Extended Edition (AOM) on steam if you like this game, or if you're into Greek, Egyptian, Norse mythology. I prefer AOE3 myself, but AOM is my second favourite in the series. Personally, I would wait until this game, and/or AOM, go on sale to buy them but I still feel they are worth the cost. Like I said at the top, I have 3 disc copies of AOE3 that all work (long story) and also disc copy of AOM. These games ARE worth it.All in all, I want to see AOE3 bounce back strong. If you're new looking for help, a partner to play with, or want to join a clan who are mostly active, just message me on steam and I hope to see you on the battlefield soon!  "

												A fun RTS? Definitely. Better than Age of Empires II? Not necessarily.Age of Empires III  is a RTS game in the 18th/19th century, featuring Native Americans, European Countries and Asian nations. The recipe is the same as always: Build your town, build units, gather resources, build more units, defeat your enemies. However, they found a few things to spice it up: - Home Cities, allowing you to seperately level up ingame and overall- shipements from your home country to gain bonus units, buffs and resources- no more gathering stations > youg et wood / money / food right away- lots of diverse nations and units, making it possible to have a huge variety of tactics.The game aged (heh) very well and still looks awesome today. Graphics are very good, same for the physics. The gameplay is very fun, even more if you play multiplayer with friends. Here is also the only downside - multiplayer requires a seperate login. However, that's not too much of a problem.Would i recommend the game to others? Yes of course! THe campaign will take a good amount of time to finish and the skirmish mode is endless. This game will continue being aweosme until they release Age of Empire IV or equivalent.			"

												Age of Empires III: Complete Collection is a real-time strategy game from Ensemble Studios and published by to what now Microsoft Studios. It is a sequel to the Age of Empires franchise. Age of Empires III: Complete Collection also contains both expansion packs from Age of Empire III.Age of Empires III saw many improvements and feature upgrades in term of gameplay while retaining the unique play of Age of Empires series. Many new features included are the new home city and card deck. Card deck allows you to call many abilities such as reinforcements of units, resources delivery, unique upgrades delivery and many more from home city to your new colony. Age of Empires III takes place in the new world of America. You will be seeing units such as the Musketeer, Dragoon, Minuteman and many cannons. Another new features added here is a trade post. Trade post can be built on trade routes or local tribes such as the Aztec to gain their allegiance and lets you train their unique units.Graphics in Age of Empires III is definitely far better improved and upgraded than the previous Age of Empires, far better effects, models and textures, shaders, everything is beautiful and fully detailed in this game. Performance is also great, no issues that can ruin your play.Seeing that many Microsoft games such as the Age of Empires II or Age of Mythology has been upgraded with Steamworks feature, Age of Empire III should see that support too, since this is the latest Age of Empire series.Age of Empire III: Complete Collection is a great game to play, I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Before this incredible game was added to Steam, I could honestly say in all the years since its release I've played well over 300 hours. This game is therapuetic. Played AoEII since 2001 and you could add at least 200 more. It deeply saddened me when Ensemble went bankrupt. However if you want MORE than the complete collection, check out the unofficial sequel/expansion pack: the Wars of Liberty mod. Adds an extra 15 or so civs and a TON of features, even modifying the current vanilla civs with special features, and with a reasonable community backing and dedicated admins keeping up with patches every now and then, you will NOT regret this.Nevertheless, this game, and franchise, is truly up there with the best RTS games money can buy. To this very day, I enjoy a cheeky skirmish or two to kill time. Absolute classic.			"

												Beautiful game! If you are one of those guys that hate easy strategy games, and want something that relies more on your capacity of situation analysis, like war strategies, economic strategies, and psychological pressure, this game is perfect for you. You have different kinds of troops, like light infantry, heavy infantry, cavalry, artillery, and your settlers. And each one counters the other. So it's all about team work and planned strategies. You can either create a strong economy, or make a fast attack. Of course it's not as simple as that. That's why this game is so awesome! Each game is full of posibilities.			"

												If you love complex and inovative RTS games this is for you; however, there are still many draw backs that new buyers should be aware of. There is no support from the dev's anymore due to complex company issues, so there will never be anymore balance changes or ui updates. Servers go down quite frequently. The little community that is there is stong but gets no attention. Over all the game is really fun but not worth spending $40 on.			"

												I wanted this game for years, finally I own it and it has been worth the wait, it's easily the best in the franchise (In my opinon.)This time you play as the power hungry european empires from the colonial era, like The British Empire (Salutes to Union flag) The French, Spainish, Russians and more, addtionally since this the Complete collection, you get the bonus DLC which includes some tribes and Asain powers like Japan.A lot of features have been added like trading posts, and you can upgrade them from transported by horse into trains, however they removed some features I enjoyed like Captapults and cannons attacking areas you want them to, for an example if theres a forest in the way, I could send a small army of cannons to destory the forest so I can build a wall or something, sadly this feature has been removed possibly due to a glitch where you can attack ally buildings with no penalties.Overall if your a fan of RTS games, there is no reason to say no to this amazing game.*Note* Everytime I hear ""The New World"" I keep thinking of these.

												Pros :This is absolutely a fun strategy time-sink. Many hours haven't even been logged on Steam for my current account due to owning two accounts with AoE3 on it. Since good RTS seem limited to Starcraft and Warcraft, I like more realism and history than a fantasy universe. The art and graphics (if that is your main focus) are beautiful. Units work create formations which I have always enjoyed in a RTS. Gathering materials is pretty basic, wood, gold, food, and balancing everything is not too stressful which is great for any strategy game. I also enjoy the way the different difficulties are set. Easy being easy enough to learn and still win and Normal seeming challenging. There is a sandbox mode which is great for people learning the game as well and dont wish to focus on combat.For single player, Age of Empires 3 has a genius combination of history, customization, and RTS. I make myself sick of this game and even if I stop for a few months I WILL be back.Cons (without bias) :Let me start with the warning alert. Over and over you will hear this as long as you are being attacked and not watching that area. It causes me to mute my game when there are multiple battles. Not fun.It seem frusturating laggy during combat and this is because of units being in formation. Getting used to a combination of different unit speeds makes you break up your selection. Being that realistic is not fun to a lot of people. Single player doesn't hold your hand during the ""tutorial"" portion. They expect you to know a bit about RTS already.The ships are terrible in huge groups which they make up for in speed. This is for both you and the enemy so it may seem that they pop up on you very quickly.			"

												While singleplayer is pretty boring, AoE III is one of the most fun RTS games in multiplayer. Factions play differently, some feel like totally different game, but at the same time they are well balanced. This also forces use of different tactics against different kinds of enemies. There is an abundance of units and buildings, and the game is fast-paced. The graphics are amazing even today, AoE III is one of the best looking RTS games I've seen. The multiplayer is well alive even today, after so many years. I definitely recommend getting this game for every RTS fan. The only thing is that you shouldn't expect a game similar to AoE or AoE II as AoE III is a different game, however, even better in multiplayer in every way. "

												Its different from the AOE 1 & 2 style , with more choices , rpg like , enhanced better graphics etc.-Story is awesome if you will choose to play campaign , 3 stories , each one is better than another.-The difficulty with this one is reasonable , i mean unlike AOE 1 & 2 campaigns , you have to be so pro to finish them without cheats , this one will let you finish the campaign with no cheats.-The purchasing unit in this game is intersting , saves alot of time than previous AOE's , for example you could build 5 units in 1 queue instead of 1 by 1 , theres also town supplies that you can get them every 4 mins ~ ( you get to choose ur cargo and set up before starting game ).-This type of games aint about graphics i know , but this game's graphics are fairly nice and pleaseing to see.-When you're done with the main story , you could still play customized battles , as you will gain experince that will allow you to level up ur own town , with way more more cards/choices/upgrades than you had in story mode.Either you're going to play it alone or with friends , its so much fun. i'd recommend buying this game in full/sale prices , worth it anyway.  9.5/10.

												Do I recommend this game? I do. I really do.It's like masterpiece of music or artwork. You can make beautiful colonies, great armies and great battles. It's not about accuracy, but about tactic, strategy. You need to get resources as fast as possible, get units and destroy your enemy. Simple, but hard, since different nation has different bonuses. So far I loved France and Portugal. France for unique settlers, which are strong and gather faster than usual settlers. Voltigeurs and Gandarmes are strong together. Advanced formation for Gandarmes recommended. (able to turn on in gameplay options)Portugal is... just beautiful. I love the language and voices they have. Cassadores are powerful long-range units with cute voice. Organ guns are ideal against infantry. Jinetes (dragoons) are hardcore enemies for cavarly, so use 'em to keep your artillery safe from enemy's horses. There maybe hard choice for pikemen or halbardies, but imo pikemen are way more useful, even if weaker. I work with 45 Cassadores and 5 Heavy Cannons (also +1 for voice) which are powerful formation, but also weak. So I used to work with weaker (low hp) units, but faster and more powerful. Rathauses (or how do you call it) are a bit annoying, since if you want to build beautiful looking colony, 3 rathauses are enough imo.Even tho price may not be very convincing, spend money on this (or wait for sale, it's always an option) and have fun. Company is fun either.			"

												A Great Game. I would say Age of Empires III is the best Of the Age of Empires series. But some might very likelly disagree with it. Specially comparing this game to Either Age of Empires II or Age of Mythology. But i prefer this game better.I cant bring myself to like the graphics in AoE II but i really do like AoM. Now for the review iself: Graphics: Nicely Detailed Envinronment with an (G)UI that is appealing and very straightfoward so you rarely get confused in the menus. Sound: Really nicelly recorded voice acting with very clear sound quality and excelent sound effects.... Although they sometimes seem a little bit too bland. Gameplay: You got a Map, Quick actions on a few buttons on the right of it and Basic information about your units such as: Unit count, unit health, attack, armor and relevant stuff. To the right of it a simple grid of commands to give to your units with very self explanatory action. Buildings can build more than one unit at a time allowing for up to five units to be deployed at the same time. It takes the same amount of time to deploy 1 unit and 5 units. Story: The game follows the story of a family known as the Black family. In which the first of them is a man Named Morgan Black. The story revolves around this particular family. This family also has relevancy in The WarChiefs. Although more to the side. ANd little relevancy in Asian Dinasties. Needless to say the story is very well structurally built with a fluent and smooth continuum without any drastic changes except between Acts 1,2 and 3. Difficulty: The game gets progressivelly harder as you progress further in the story. The same can be said in multiplayer except in multiplayer there is a point where the difficulty will stall as the game seems like its going nowhere.The final missions of each act are Significantly Harder than any other missions in each act. GFX: I already talked about graphics but now is for a less apparent thing. The effects used are detailed to a certain degree and really gives that extra punch to make them even more immersive. Variety: The whole game speaks variety. All countries have thier own unique characteristic. For instance, the Dutch can build banks which produce coin/gold constantly, albeit a little bit slower than mines, but never run out. The French have a better kind of villager (Called settler in the game) that is called ""Coureur des bois"" it gathers resources considerably faster, but cost more and take longer to train/build. Total: Overall, this game is a masterpeice for sure. But you probably wont want to play it if you dont have enough time. Because this game gets very long sometimes.			"

												The game is very enjoyable. Nice graphics like for a year of production, enjoyable missions in Campaign and a large variety offered by the multiplayer as well as singlplayer. Every game is not perfect, and this too has its drawbacks, one of which is the inability to select many languages, which is propably a problem for a younger players, but unfortunately you can't do anything about it. I could exchange the advantages and disadvantages, but i think thats enough to say that this game is really good and I really recommend this game for fans of open world-strategy games.			"

Posted: December 21, 2015
												Introduction: My favorite RTS franchise of all time! Loved AoE 2 especially! Now coming to this one I wouldn't say its perfect as there are many new additions which is a mixed bag but overall I liked this game after spending some time. Played all of the AoE games and I would happily place this at the second place after AoE 2 HD.Campaign: Campaign in short is okay but mind you I didn't complete it though. Its not easy either but it just didn't feel interesting enough to me so as of now I have yet to complete it. So take someone elses opinion regarding the Campaign.Multiplayer: The multiplayer community is decently active, around 1300 to 1500 players are online on most weekends. Multiplayer is also one of the strongest points of this game as with 2 or 3 players against 'expert' mode Bots it can be really fun while being challenging and you can 'master' the game more quickly by playing with veteran players! So I recommend playing Multiplayer if you get the game. If the ESO Servers are down for some reason you can still play multiplayer on Gameranger and Voobly. Some dedicated players play there exclusively.Conclusion: Besides the Multiplayer the Skirmish Mode can also be challenging and decently fun to play. Other than that all I would say in the end is that I can definitely recommend this game when on sale to those looking for a RTS to play with friends. Yes this game has some bugs on more recent Operating Systems like Windows 10 though it can be fixed. Also there are some issues like path finding and builders getting stuck after building structures though it can be taken care of if you build your Empire a little spread out rather can cramping your structures while making sure you have it well defended with castles on all sides.NOTE : When you click on the 'Play' Button it will give you several options like AoE: Complete Edition, War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties etc. The full game with all the expansions is the Asian Dynasties option not the Complete Edition option ironically!Also for Windows users while you would expect Steam Overlay like every other game here it doesn't works for this game unless you run Steam in Administrator Mode though it depends on your UAC settings.

												This review comes after a four-in-the-morning-coffee-fueled 3 hour run of the game, just to give perspective.So I'd been wanting to buy AoE3 for a while, since I got AoE2HD actually, and the oppotunity came up, so y'know, here I am. After playing a substantial amount of AoE2HD, I thought I knew the system pretty well and there wouldn't be a shock to the system.Well..This third installment of the series was actually quite surprising, obviously there is the update in graphics, which is really smooth and eye-pleasing. Some of the games mechanics change too, gone are the days of clusters of gold and stone, mining camps and the like, it's been simplified so that all you need are settlers (Villagers). There's also a system where the player can use a card deck for a civilisation that bring in certain imports, such as food crates, siege equipment or units. This spices things up because to unlock these, you must gain XP (another new addition), this is done by killing enemy units, or building trading posts along trade routes or next to native hamlets.Basically, if you like the Age of Empires series, get this game (Preferably on sale, as it's bloody expensive when it isn't)Rating - 8/10 Tentacles			"

												This is one of my all time favorite games. I've been playing these titles since they came out in the late 90's and they are just as good now as they were back then. The complete collection is amazing with no glitches and great game play. If your a real time strategy person this is the game for you. It's not a new titile so the graphics are a little dated. The maps are huge and you can play up to 8 people. Theres also an online mode with a ton of active players. It's very competative so I advise getting some practice in before you decide to take on some people online. The on-line games are pretty diverse with a risk mode, supremecy , zombies and a bunch more. The game is also fun to play with a few friends. There's a campain mode, a senario mode, and an online mode. Lots of game play for a reasonable price. Hope you liked the review and see you on the battle field.			"

												This game never gets old. Even though most of the modern base builder games are more in depth. This one just sits in a special corner of mine for games that I will always love. I started playing Age of Empires when they were first released and once this on was released on Steam at a good price I had to jump on it. The graphics are simple the task is simple.. destroy the other players or play though the campaign and destroy the other groups. This game is a progression style base builder which means you start in an early age and advance once you have the materials to progress which will give you better technology. The faster you advance before others the bigger weapons you have to destroy :) or take the non violent way and just build a wonder... But there is no fun in that :p I recommend this game to anyone who likes to lob spears.. you go lob them spears ;) "

The story line is amazing and although not perfectly historically accurate, its close enough that if you know your history, you will be able to relate the time period and settings to the characters story line. Graphics were phenomenol for their time so it still looks good today. All of the classic rts game play exists here. IMO this is the last great rts game made			"

												Age of Empires 3 is the third and (seemingly) final game in the Age of Empires series. If you  don't know already, it's a traditional real-time-strategy game set in the colonial and imperial ages of European history, with a little of flair of Asia for kicks. Although Age of Empires games traditionally feature a very strong campaign, the replay factor in AOE is always the multiplayer and skirmish options, and this time players are given a multitude of options to suit their gameplay preferences. As a ""turtle"" (high defense, weak offense) player, I especially like the ""treaty"" mode, which turns off combat for a set number of minutes at the beginning of each round and also forces players to build their base within a confined space during that time period. As with previous games in the series, AoE3 features 4 different ""age"" milestones that allow your civilization to access new technologies and units.The Good:* Trading cards enabled.* Different civilizations, especially those from different continents, have entirely separate styles of play, giving the game different ""flavors"" of play and replayability.* Rather than just giving each civilization unique units and technologies, AOE3 takes ""Uniqueness"" a step further by giving every play 21 ""bonus cards,"" which can be used to dramatically alter your play choices. Two players can conceivably play as the same civilization and require completely different strategies and playstyles due to the bonuses given to them by their cards.* Vastly more multiplayer options than the predecessors in the series.* Some Civs, such as the Sioux, are fairly simplistic. This is a positive attribute as it allows differently-skilled players to enjoy the game in their own way.* There is a ""home city building"" side-game that is a little enjoyable.The Bad:* I feel like a game that supports 1000+ units on the screen and 1920x1080 resolution should let me zoom the map out a bit further. My town center annoyingly takes up way too much of my view!* No Steam achievements.* Antiquated map controls - the only way to scroll the map is by moving your cursor to the edge of the screen. RTS games should support WASD map scrolling and/or click 'n' drag.* The final ""age"" is rarely ever needed in a match, and costs more than it benefits your team, in my opinion.* Map-editing is nowhere near as easy and intuitive as it was in previous AOE games.* Weak AI. It seems like a 1 vs. 1 AI opponent always focuses strictly on cavalry, which in turn focuses me to only focus on building one type of unit.The Ugly:* Horribly WRONG launcher screen. When starting the game, you are given the choice of loading (a) Age of Empires III: Complete Collection, (b) Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs, and (c) Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties. However, option ""A"" is not complete at all: choosing it gives you access to neither of the two expansions. Option B gives you access to the War Chiefs Expansion (but not Asian Dynasties), and Option C gives you access to ALL game content: the base game and both expansions.* Not as fun as AOE2. A sequal should be a step forward, not a step back. The differences are noticeable in all sorts of small areas, which individually would not be a problem, but lend to an overall diminished quality. Some examples are unit formations being nowhere near as ""tight,"" and units having a tendency to WALK into battle if they are grouped with a slower unit.The Verdict:* At the time of this writing, the base price for AO3 is $39.99. That is overpriced, especially since AO2-HD is a more solid and overall better game and comes for the same base price. However, I do think AOE3 is worth checking out if you can get it on sale. I have had a lot of fun with this game, perhaps 100 hours or so, before it ever became available on Steam. But now that AO2-HD has come out, I see little reason to play AO3.			"

												At first, I was hesitant to play Age of Empires III, refusing it due to the sheer fact that it has guns. I see now how foolish I was. This game is by far one of the best in the series, the asthetics being amazing, the gameplay unique from the other games, letting you actually progress a bit, and train groups of units rather than singles, and, honestly, the guns are not overpowered or cheap, they work really well in the AOE setting. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes AOE, or any RTS. Give it a try, you just might like it. 9/10.			"

												GameSpot said it best: ""Age of Empires III has some very big shoes to fill"".It is a very good game, and there are barely any real flaws to speak of, but I still prefer its predecessor, even though almost everything that was good about Age of Empires II is improved here, most noticeably the A.I. and the graphics.Perhaps the historical era covered by the game and its heavy focus on gunpowder in later stages isn't as compelling, and the scenario editor (which played a big part in Age of Empires II's prolonged success) is a little more complicated to use.But the core gameplay, which is easy to understand, but hard to master, remains pretty much the same, with some interesting additions like the ""Capital City"" and the ability to choose different bonuses as you advance through the ages, a similar system to the one seen in Age of Mythology.If you're a fan of the ""Age"" series or you just enjoy well-designed, polished real-time strategy games, or are looking to get into the genre, Age of Empires III is definitely worthy of your time and money.

												Super fun game, especially if you play with your friends online. There are many different civilizations to choose from and each one has a unique playstyle which can be strong or weak depending on how you play them and how your enemy plays as well. Very difficult but very fun at the same time. So much strategy and thought goes into every match and you have to make very quick and precise decisions or else you can set yourself behind from the very start and lose extremely easily. Keep in mind that this game is over a decade old now so the graphics are not ""cutting edge"" but the game still looks good, and graphics don't really matter in this type of game anyways. With how old the game is, the online functionality can be pretty bad at times. I've had many time with my friends where we struggled to all get into the same lobby together as some of us could connect and others literally could not join no matter what. There are rumors of an Age of Empires 4 possibly being made, but I wouldn't count on that too much. Despite the online problems, all the game mechanics work very good and the strategy required to succeed is insane. I recommend this to anyone who likes a thought invoking game.			"

												This game is worth every single penny. It's a classic RTS game. It's fairly easy to get the jist of. Hell, even I got the hang of it quickly. That really speaks volumes to me. This game is even better when you have someone to play with or against. On occasion, the online service will run into problems and people may not be able to join your game and/or you won't be able to join theirs. I have only recently started to notice this problem (10/31/15) so I am not sure how common it will become. It usually just takes a bit of time to fix itself though.As mentioned before, it's real-time strategy. You get to pick the Civilization that you like the most. These include the Germans, Spanish, British, Asian civs,  Native American civs, and a lot more. Each have their own strategies. In the game, you are pitted against another Civ(s), whether it be an AI or an actual player. Your civilization's economy relies on 3 things: food, wood, and coin. Your villagers, or workers, must work to gather these resources and build your colony. You can use the resources to create buildings, buy improvements, and train an army.Eventually, you'll need an army. There are infantry, calvalry, and artillery units. You can also have naval battles with various ships if there is a body of water on the map. As mentioned before, there are numerous strategies for victory. I'd recommend trying out all the Civilizations and see which one you feel most comfortable with.Overall, this game is godly. It will stand the test of time, and I hope that the online service will remain available for years to come (after all, it still has a sizable community).P.S. There is a fort called Het Huys de Hoop.			"

												Following on from the monumental success that was Age of Empires II, this third installment brings the franchise into the light with jaw-droppingly amazing graphics and a style of gameplay that is a dream to play. The attention to detail is astounding, from everything to cracks in a townhouse just about ready to crumble, to the wide range of sound effects ranging from hilarously stereotypical comments from Isabella of Spain to Frederick the Great of Germany, to the sounds of canons such as the Falconets. Even the different environments manage to evoke a sense of belonging, as if one is truly standing in the snow in Siberia, or sweating bullets in Caribbean - not an easy feat for a strategy game to achieve. The fact that no major installment have been released since (Age of Empires IV anyone?) is simply a testament to the replay value and endurance of one of the all-time greatest strategy games released.VERDICT: 10/10			"

The campaigns are challenging and fun, there are a great varierty of maps to master and a good amount of civs. Even at the full price is still worth it but if you can buy on sale its a no brainer !!The community is still very active and there are community run tournaments with cash prizes. There is lots of youtube and twitch content, plenty of established mods and mods currently under development, new maps, observer UI and scenarios.

												I played this game when it came out 10 years ago. The conventional thinking is that Age of Empires II is the ""best,"" but the truth is that Age of Empires III is actually the best.I'll make it simple. Age of Empires III is better because it's newer and it's more of a game and less of a time killer. There is actually a single-player with a real story to the campaign. There are a ton of different units in the game and I haven't even gotten to the DLC yet. This version is more fast-paced and is equally as fun on land as it is on water.There is one issue that isn't major, but it kind of is for me. That is the game hasn't been updated in a while and doesn't allow for steam overlay (shift+tab) and does not contain any achievements. I'm not sure if the game supports 4K either.I am using WIndows 10 with a GTX 970 and i5-4466. There are absolutely no technical hiccups and the game runs very smooth.Overall, great game that surpasses Age of Empires II in every way while looking GREAT for its age. Also, no major bugs or compatibility issues with Windows 10. Needs update to add new steam features like the Shift+Tab overlay and achievements.			"

												Summary: Age of Empires III offers gamers the next level of realism, with advanced battle physics and unparalleled visual detail. The new game picks up where Age of ""Empires II: Age of Kings"" left off, placing gamers in the position of a European power determined to explore, colonize and conquer the New World. This time period features stunning scenes, from towering European cathedrals to courageous tribes of Native Americans, and spectacular combat with Industrial Age units like rifled infantry, cavalry and tall ships bristling with cannons. Age of Empires III excites strategy gamers with new game-play elements, including the concept of a ""Home City,"" new civilizations, units, technologies and an immersive new single-player campaign that will span three generations. Recommendation: I crucially recommend this game to all Strategic game lovers :)			"

I wish microsoft would see how much people love this game and make a REAL sequal to it or even a HD remaster. I have to say thank you to the people who worked at ensemble for making this game happen and making my childhood great. 10/10 must buy.

												Better than AOE 2 ofcourse :)Play the game for a lil bit, Like it.... This game is a small scale war, unlike C&C Series or Total War Series.Simple RTS game with max population cap to 200. Mid-Age wars with horse, sword, lance, bow, and cannon artillery.Why it's better than AOE 2 :+ Significant graphic improvement+ Significant Improvement in gameplay+ Neutral campaign on maps (defeat the treasure guardians to get bonus for early  level)+ Trading Post available on maps (Neutral area which can be post by ur building for extra content) + U can train 5 units at once per queue, except worker+ Card System. This is used for shipment (shipment is somekind of a free bonus given to u for leveling up in the game)+ Unlockable & Costumizable Shipment (Various bonus that can be used in game)+ Indian Tribes have Warpit, and the other side Western country have Factory The bad thing in AOE 3 : - Towers has a limited build to 7.- Town Center can't be build by workers, instead by Hero / Explorer / WarChief & sent by shipment.- Town Center has build limit- Military units no longer can be garrison into castle or towers- Castle is an exclusive building, can't be build by workers instead by shipment.Well I don't like to play the Asian Dynasties anyway it's imba, just stick with The Warchief expansion.Having fun with this installment,  not the best RTS game on the market, but  'S awright to givin' 2 thumbs up for tis game.About the online multiplayer ? i dunno, never try it, cause  i play it just for single player fun mode only :DScore : 80/100			"

												AoE... Need I say more? If you like things that are awesome, there really isn't much more that you can ask for. Lean back in your chair and builld an empire, harvest resources... Then storm the gates of your enemies and destroy them.Then make some hot pockets and do it again.			"

												Age of Empires 3 is a great game, in my opinion better then the previous titles.Age of Empires 3 (especially the complete collection) provides with so many scenarios it makes my head spin, its geniunely challenging and the fact that I can spawn a Monster Truck in a game to murder my foes should be a testiment to the amazing game this is.Buy this game, like, yesterday.

												AoE 3 is the third installment in the series, offers an intriguing main single player story as various characters search for the fountain of youth. The single player skirmishes, custom made games, and multiplayer is the bread and butter of the game. In single player skirmishes, enemies are further apart, giving your base time to upgrade and build your army to your specifications before attacking enemy camps. You receive experience points when in battle, building, working, etc. Combat is much better than in AoE2, but unless you are playing on harder difficulties, the AI isn't as good as in AoE2.  This time around you  get wars dogs as well as cannons, and other weapons. You can build decks of cards for the shipments to your colony, forge alliances with natives or other allies to take over the new world.  There are a few things in the game that is annoying. 1. You can't put your soldiers in patrolling mode, you have to manually put them where you want them to be. 2. The npcs are dumber than a bag of rocks. Workers will just stand there while being attack instead of fighting back, soldiers will ignore enemies attack them while they are attacking buildings. 3.They have taken out most of the different matches from AoE2 like King of the Hill, Capture the Relic, Wonder Race, Deathmatch (where you start with supplies), and other matches that made AoE2 great making this game a dumb down version of AoE2. It is still a very good game in the series it just lacks depth. The music is okay and the graphics are beautiful I just wish it had more to offer. 8/10. A good strategy game to own.			"

												Age of Empires series was supposed to be the best series around - as I've read through many and many reviews. Many people recommended this game and when I saw it on sale I gave it a shot. Basically, this game is like European Wars : Cossacks. Old style RTS. The only downside to this Age of Empires versus the second is the way you can choose formations in the second. It felt overall the second had more to control whereas the third sort of simplified things and tried to make the game easier and smoother. AoE 3 is your typical RPG, offering peasants (or settlers), militias, markets, church's, walls and gates to protect your city. I really can't see all the hype about this game to be truthful as everyone says. Yes the campaign stories are good, but I find that this game doesn't really set itself apart from other RTS's. If I had a choice between playing European Wars : Cossacks or this - I would most likely choose EW : Cossacks. Not to say that this game is bad, but the options that are given in EW far outweigh those of AoE for me. I would give it an 8 if it had something to differentiate itself from other RTS of it's class, but RATING : 7.6/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B- "

Addressing Concers for the GameThis reaches back to memories. I remember playing this game back when I was a kid. It was either my first or second RTS game that I still play even today. There are balancing problems, but I'm not the guy who favors the idea of balancing. However, it is worth noting that there are problems with certain civilations within the game as I spend the majority of my time in the multiplayer.Multiplayer Civilation Problems/Underdogs/My Opinion and ConcernsSome civilations, even through balancing with the popuation and resources, are just underdogs on their economy or just plain tough suckers who are hard to kill. An example of this are the Azetcs and the French. The Azetcs have food eco. power, but they lack in earning gold to pay for required units to counter such others. The French have an elite calvary that my cost alot in food, gold, and population. However, even that balancing doesn't stop them from being massively produced quickly and used effienctly. It becomes a redundant tactic to use in multiplayer games. Other civilations also have such advantages like the Russians using advance formations with seige calvary surrounding a horse archer to form a compact square formation in treaty games. This would generally cause massive economic damages and strategic disappointment for the opposing team. There are more in the game, but these are just a few examples.Unit Combat/Understanding of the UnitsThe game has unit balancing that kills the reality of what would really happen at the time, but I don't blame them for that balancing. An example is that a lightly armored unit can be have resistance to guns and arrows, and the same can be side to heavly armored Chinese units. I'm not saying that all firearms and archaic bows can break through dense armor, but I believe that the game should be updated to the point where things can make some sense and use. This is because that every unit within the game have only one resistance to a certain type of attack. There is the seige, the ranged, and the melee attack. Each has a different use and affect on certain units. There are even other units that can absorb lots of balls from muskeets and still not die. Even when they are lightly armored. I do want to note and point out my understanding that the game is an old RTS from 2005 with a golden RTS combat system, but looking at this just breaks my reality I put in the game.EconomyEach and every map in the game that are offical are designed differently with certain arount of food (animals/berries/treasures), gold (mines/treasures), and wood (trees). In addition, there are certain sites that can improve the players economy, such as trading posts. Do you that everything that is ""natural"" in the map is a consumable.  So, this makes them a nonreliable source of income. To further worsen this, they are all spread out through out the map. This stress the player to try to control the map and protect their gathers from hurrassments, which is what I like. What I don't like is that when the map runs out of trees, I have to rely on trading at the market. The market is a building that is used to upgrade your gathers to increase gathering rate. In the game, upgrades will generally consume two of the resources (food,wood, or gold) to perform upgrade for combat unit, gathering, minor improvements, and etc. Now, the problem with every map in the game is when the trees are all gone. Wood is esstential for constructing buildings and certain units. When wood is gone, this causes the player to rely on the markets or vulgar production from factions, trading post, and wood producing units. They don't produce a decent needed amount that is need for the battle. This makes pikemen and longbows useless; one of the few units that can counter French calvary are upgraded pikemen. Some civilations don't need to worry about wood income like Japan. Their shrines can generate a lot when upgraded and max. However, for them to generate more they need animals. In standard games, Japan is a faction that you might not want in your team due the fact that some players will generally take animals you use as food for their purposes. When that happens, you can't kill the animal for food. They are protected by the shrine from being killable or taken. This leads to another topic about popuation that I'll explain about later; Japan has a small limit of the amount of villagers that can produce. Back to topic, this causes Japan to become dependent on animals and other players to produce domesticated animals for them. Even more...Home cities are cities that provide aid to the player in the game. They do so by shipping passive upgrades that are unique to certain civilations, standard upgrades, consumbles, units, buildings, or ships for the cost of points(levels). Points are earned by reaching a ceratin xp (level (> or = to) xp). Xp is earned naturally, produced, or in bountry of a unit's death. Not all civilations can have passive upgrades to improve their economy to a decent or dramatic advantage. Take a look at the Aztecs. They can bloom their food production so well, but lacking in gold production to train certain units. To make this even worse for them, they can't have access to resource production type buildings or enchance to gathering like the Indians. Same can be said about all Native American civilations, and their firepits can screw up their uses of villagers in desprite times.PopulationMost Civilations have a popuation limit. This is a balance to pervent overwhelming quanity of units that we are all not interesting in coming at use. However, the there are limits in the amount of units each civilations have train. Most civilations can train upto 99 villagers/settlers/gathers (the three are interchangable). However, those who gets a benefits on their economy has a reduction to the amount of villagers they can have. This is a balance to pervent massive generation of income for a civilation. Do know that there are ways to lose a game. One of them is lose all your gathers, your town center, and your hero. So, those with lower villager counts are in a risk if they aren't protected. What I like:Decent Amount of CivilationsDecent Amount of UnitsAdvance Formations OptionsGood Options/Setting for a 2005 GameA Stable Way of IncomeMap Control is KeyUnit Combat is OkayVillager Gathering is OkayCivilations are uniqueWhat I want... Updates maybe and less redundant actions in the game? If you guys have any concerns about stuff you want me to address I'll add them below here. Questions about game mechanics will be answered in the comments. Anything that is etc. will also be answered in the comments. If there are grammar mistakes or something you want me to take another look back in the review please also note them in the comments ,too.  Pros Cons   Adds Asian Factions Underdog Factions   Okay Balancing ♥♥♥♥ed up Balancing   Lots of Units to Choose From Hard to Kill Units That Ruins Match Kill Results   Shift to Count for Five in Hundreds or Ones Digits Hotkeys are Poorly Designed "

												Age of Empires III, is by far my most favorite RTS game of all time. It is a well balanced masterpiece with plenty to do that will keep you busy for hours. Well balanced as in, it has that mixture to where it isn't too militaristic. You spend a lot of time improving your economy. Between building your Empire, leveling and customizing your home city, and developing new technologies, you'll be hard crossed to go to bed at a decent time. It has multiplayer, thirty or so maps, a scenario editior, and twelve unique nations ranging from the powerful British Empire to the traditional Japanese. This game is beautiful, even on my potato battery laptop. I've been in love with this game since 2005. I lost my retail copy so i was thrilled when it was added to the Steam Store. MANY more people should know about this game. It has tons of depth, and is one of the few games from Microsoft i love. Do yourself a favor, and buy this game! It is most certainly worth the hefty price tag!			"

												The game that reassigned the life goals of thousands of angry real-time strategy nerds who relentlessly blasted death metal out of their sterephones while molesting the taunt buttons when it first came back - is still alive and well. That is, perhaps not so much as when it first premiered, but AoE 3 still attracts a considerable amount of gamers which is impressive given how the strategy gaming industry was completely dwarfed with upsurge of other games is latter years. There's not much of a gripe you can hold against this now-classic: the texture and gameplay is focused and realistic, in startling contrast to the puerile graphics of the prequel (although I won't hold back that Age 2 also rocked) as well as the addition of the home city, which granted a completely new dynamic to the game. As is the problem with most strategy games, the inherently incoherent AI (some kind of stratagem devised by evil game planners to render games inconsistent and all puddy) is a bit problematic, but it's still something that can be coped with. The Online could definitely use some revitalizations, though. Yeah, everyone knows Ensemble Studios called it quits years ago, but still... can't someone do something to add some color to the online community and gameplay? The lack of updates is unnerving.However, AoE retains its place as one of the best RTS games, ever. Even the two expansion packs kicked♥♥♥♥♥ Asian Dynasties in particular added an exotic and 'colonial' palette to the game that made it even more memorable for me. The addition of three new factions (China, India, Japan) certainly made the game the well-nigh perfect, multinational, multi-tactical strategy delight. So without further ado, here's what you would expect from AoE 3:1)Strategy rampage.2)Fast-as♥♥♥♥♥♥cavalry running down your hapless peasants.3)Slow-as-dirt peasants 'collecting' resources.4)No corpses.5)Finding a mother♥♥♥♥ing enemy base near your town center just because you didn't have a proper sight.6)Wreckage.7)Learning the basic words for most languages.8)General ♥♥♥♥ed-upedness on the battlefield when your batallion of musketeers get creamed by a few cannons.9)Magical unicorn-horses attached to artillery that appear whenever the artillery piece has to be carried and disappear when you start shootin'.10)Free geography, history and zoology lessons.11)Free philosophy lessons from Monks or other atavistic religious dudes whom you'll name after your ex-girlfriend's pet iguana - who can literally outwit their opponents by a having a thick-as-♥♥♥♥ smoke (did they even have that stuff in China back then?) .12)Flying numbers.13)Paying attention to the meticulous numerical details of every unit until you realize that your horde of 100 pikemen can be ♥♥♥♥ed by a pack of rockets.14)Epic flanking action.15)Facing stubborn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who wouldn't give in even after you've destroyed their town centers.16)Taunts! (number 15 in particular)17)Witnessing the beauty of a New England forest until ramming it down with a barrage of mortars.18)Imperialism. Exploitation.19)Where every Wall Street magnate begins: the 100 wood market.20)Stupid ♥♥♥♥ing peasants getting stuck in between the buildings that they built.21)Tresures guarded by wolves, dogs, jaguars and other animals who pack a serious punch.22) Treasures that can be literally collected by empty ships (because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why) .23)Literally immortal colony explorers who yell like 9-year-old ♥♥♥♥♥es when they 'die' and start clutching their stomachs in agony as if they're on their period.24)Stupid ♥♥♥♥ing population limits.25)Villagers that sigh for unexplained reasons whenever they spawn.26)Realizing that the narrator from the tutorial is the same guy as Arkantos fron Age of Mythology!And so forth. It's a fun ride. You'll learn along the way.So yeah, go buy the game. It's not like you've anything better to do.			"

												AOE3 is a very good strategy game. Personaly i think its better than AOE2. It is fun to play, and very exiting. the online has not the highest  ammont of players, and that is too bad cause it ofen take some time to make a match. but the game is so good that it is worth buying. and it has a great campain too. If you like strategy games this is a game for you.			"

												I've been playing this game A lot before it came on steam so don't judge the review based on the number of hours.Anyways, age of empires 3.... its just fantasticI grew up playing age of empires games, from the first one up to this one, and each one was just so much fun, including this one...Now It's not the most nostalgic experience, but it does bring me back to those days where RTS was amazing... everything about it feels good, the mechanics, the gameplay, it all feels nice compared to other RTS's ive played..One thing that pisses me off is that you keep getting free villagers, and i don't really know (ironically enough) if i can turn that off or not, another thing is that sometimes i feel that resources run out way too quickly, or maybe i just suck at resource management..I have yet to go through multiplayer (im not highly interested in it, i mostly play skirmish since im a loner), so i don't really have much of an opinion on it..The graphics are good, i mean for a game this old i don't expect crysis llke graphics, and i feel that the graphics suit the game pretty well.In the end, this game is just fun, there are some bugs, but i barely really notice them, if you want a GOOD RTS, this game is for you, hey, it's AoE, nothing can go wrong there.EDIT: Some of the music in this game is really nice, by the way			"

												Whether you are a fast paced strategist or a laid back gamer, Age of Empires might be the game for you. Personally, I can't keep up with the many skilled players in the online PvP part of the game, however, I enjoy the more personal single player skirmishes that AoE has to offer. That is not say that the community is terrible, because it is just exactly the opposite. When I first was trying to learn the hotkeys and tips and tricks of the experts, there were many players willing to take their time and guide me when I needed guidance. As you may have seen from the trailers and videos of this game, there is much fun to be had. The beauty of being able to conquer another empire is a victory in and of itself. It is a great game to come home to and just unwind from the stresses of the day. The campaign mode can be quite easy, so I recommend trying to challenge yourself and set the difficulty a bit higher than you normally would. The AI in the game can be slow and unchallenging should you choose the normal or easy settings. Also, the story is very cinematic so try to watch the video bits if that's your thing.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It is great for all ages of players.			"

												A fair sucessor to AoE2 it takes gameplay to a 3D level but keeps the Age of Empires charm. It adds new features like a hero and hunting which add different stratagies to the game. In my opinion the gameplay is quite different to the second AoE which is misleading. Still this game pushes new limits for it's time and retains the live action charm of its previous version.			"

												  Having started my AoE experience with Age of Empires II back when it came out, I started playing this game with a high level of Skepticism. At first I didn't even really like it, it felt awkward to me, and perhaps I was a bit biased since I favor AoE2 (and still do). In fact I even stopped playing this altogether for several months. But I finally came back to it with an open mind, and ya know what... after completing the first campaign... it grew on me a little and started to win me over. It's not as great as its predecessor. But still quite fun and deserves its own place in your gaming library!			"

												Age of Empires 3 is my favorite game. Yes, that places it infront of other video game giants, including Arma, Warband, Civilization, and perhaps more appropriately, Age of Empires 2.It's not the graphics... it's definately not the graphics. They're not bad per se, in fact they are sometimes beautiful, but compared to the standard rts of today, they probably rank 4 or 5 out of 10.AoE 3 is my favorite game because it's *fun*. Over the last decade or so, I've loved and then grown tired of dozens of games, Fallout 4 being the most recent victim. Age 3, however, is always fun. AI provides a challenge, the community is still amazingly friendly and going strong, there are tournaments where you can win cash prizes, plenty of mods, and a quite large amount of diverse factions. When you drop yourself into a game, both single and multiplayer, it's an engaging experience every time. Honestly, I can't even find the words to explain why it's always so fun, it just is. Perhaps it's the historical care given to each unit, or maybe the ridiculous cheats and snarky comments of the AI, I don't know. If I said every game was completely unique, I'd be lying; but that's not a problem, because Age 3 does what works.I usually don't like writing reviews, especially ones over 9 words, but this game deserves at least a little bit of support from me. It's the least I can do for the most captivating game on the steam market.			"

Old farts say the second one of the series was bettuh but they just crank as fuc. Got it when it was 8 smackaroos and lemme tell you they were well spent. Me and my bubs played this on multiplayer too and it was as fun as taking a sht in the n-th dimension while going at the speed of light. I mean like I was playing the Ottoman's and I had these big as fuc cannons that just blew everything up. Liek Yall dont even know fun until you blow the fuc out of some dumbass peasants working on a farm. It was liek BOOM and then BOOM and BAM and it was all fun until some sht asss enemy cannon started blowing up my factories that were making them. But other than that it was hella fun. The single player is real cool too with the campaign and sht. I mean this game is even kinda historically accurate so its some educational sht too. So if yall have kids, get em this game and theyll learn their sht cuz this is like studying history but doing it in a funner way where you can just kill ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. But seriously doe dog, this game is da sht. Highly recommended sht here bubs.			"

												I am a big fan of the AOE series, and history. This game is brilliant, although the AI may be silly at times *cough, Napolean* it still has unique gameplay and good graphics, as well a Pretty decent uprgade system. I loved the fact that different units would take up a certain amount of population, e.g. A dragoon would take up 2 population where as apose to a musketeer taking up 1. There is a huge variety of map choices and with the Asian dynasties pack and The war cheifs DLC, the selection choices are endless, they vary from the Amazon River, The Andes, Anywhere in the America's and even the Asian Maps. What I love most though is the story based campaigns, I have finished the Asian one's which I find very addicting, but the way the whole plot goes together makes it so intresting, the characters always serve a unique purpose on the battlefeild, + they are well designed.My favourte part in my Japanese campaign, was when I sent a group of Ninjas into the enemy base using stealth mode, to assassinate the leading daimyo, Immedialty after his death, a rebellion started and I gained control of most of the map. :P +1 BodygaurdsBoromir approves 9.5/10			"

												Good graphics game, fair Age of Empire II successor, but i feel more enjoyment while playing AoE II. The UI of AoE II is far better, not so robust, showing more things at once. This game is a bit simplified although it was not needed, because AoE was easy to understand game always.Well, not so good as AoE II, but still good to play game. A bit overpriced for an old game - 37€. If you don't have any AoE game, I recommend to get AoE II first for 20€.			"

												Fun variation on the age of empires formula, many features are ""streamlined"" and aoe-lovers might turn their nose on that.For example the workers don't have to make the trip back with the resources, this completely removes the skill involved (where once you had to properly place a gathering building, abuse sweetspots and manage workers, here you just tell the workers to gather X resource until it runs out) but allows for the game to run a lot faster.Many changes in aoe3 are like that, a gameplay feature is changed or removed completely so that the matches last less.But it's not just a ""simpler age of empires set in colonial times"", it adds 2 features that distinguish it from the ancestor and cousins completely: hereos and shipments.Age of empires doesn't have ""important"" units, everything is sacrificable as long as you spent less compared to the enemy's losses worth. Because of this the idea of a powerful RPG-like ""hero"" unit is not only heretical it's illogical and goes against the concept itself, does it work in aoe3?It doesn't and it does.It's not really an actual hero, it's an explorer unit that you can use for scouting or for clearing ""creep camps"" that give you a bit (or a lot, if the camp is big) of resources that you can use to strengthen your army, or build buildings. Other than clearing ""monsters"" the hero can build trading posts, these can be used to connect to neutral camps that give you a (weak) unit to train and (sometimes good) improvements for your economy, or travel routes which give you experience and this connects us to the next part the ""trading cards"" system:The experience points you gain through certain buildings don't go to your hero or any unit in your army, but instead allow you to receive ""shipments"" from the mainland. Meaning you can get moscow/amsterdam/istanbul (or whatever your home city is) to send you a shipment of resources, extra villagers, buildings, improvements, entire armies to help you fight.Aoe2 (and aoe) while fun in its own way, suffered from its length, only at 10 minutes you get to age up, aoe3 uses the above to ""fix"" that, with enough skill, by 10 minutes you might hit the last age.Not everybody can get there, but it's possible.Other than the several races, the shipment system can be edited allowing for a deeply personalized ""deck"" and gameplay style, takes a while to get used to, but the standard deck isn't painful to play with either.The servers work, and people still play, there's a consistent community that still gets to hone their skills.do you recommend this game?Not for 30 dollars, but the game goes on sale pretty regularely, get it then, it's well worth it if you want a faster  (but by no means simpler) age of empires title.

A brilliant game with a still very alive online community for the stand alone game.Solid story line and can be as difficult as you want it to be. As far as im concerned the whole game is a 8/10. I didn't give this a 10 because I know this is the last in the series and the graphics are starting to show their age. However I could put both these factors aside and give it a 10 if it wasnt for the lack of updates. Also adding no rush as a game type would of helped my review.Overall do buy, it's been nearly 10 years since I bought this game and i'm still playing it and will continue to if the online stays strong.

												This is one of the best games I ahev played.  I have been playing AOE from the time the first came out.  When this came out it was really something neat.  The guys have shadows and leave tracks in the sand.  I actually fried a graphics card many years ago playing this game... it was a mid range card.  Multi player is realy fun with my kids.			"

												Classic Real-Time Strategy set in during the colonisation of the Americas. Play as several European empires, the Dutch, German, French, British, Spanish etc. in multiplayer battles consisting of constructing a base, forming an economy, training an army and pillaging your enemies. Game modes range from FFA, TDM, King of the Hill, Treaty, Supremacy or Deathmatch and custom scenarios. Single-player campaign serves as great starting point for novices of the series to learn how to play before making the leap into multiplayer. Great for LAN parties.			"

												I've probably played about 10 matches online. I'm late to the game and it's kinda hard for new players to get into lobbies with experienced players due to a level difference. I was kicked from lobby many times for being low level. Gameplay is terrific. I only experienced a lag issue once - all 8 players couldn'y move and units for about 45 seconds at the start of the game and then everything was fine after.			"

Pointless nostalgic introBack in 2005, when AoE III was released, I'd already been playing the 2nd for several years. Being an amateur and enthusiast of medieval warfare, the period of time didn't seem too appealing to me. Moreover, I was so used to the iconic 2D graphics of the first 2 AoE titles, that I couldn't join yet the revolution Age of Mythology had started some time earlier.Then, I found a torrent for the vanilla plus TWC somewhere in 2009 or '10 and it didn't took a while before I developed a passion for the game. But enough of my personal history and feelings with the game's series.Actual review and ratingI rate the whole expanded game 8/10*. If I were you I would wonder what's wrong with the game so that you didn't rate it 10/10? The main reason I didn't entirely like AoE III was:-Lack of deep european theatreWhich subsequently implies the game lacks the following content (more or less):-European maps and respective natives (local inhabitants that commonly formed regional cultures)-European conflicts within Europe (like the Napoleonic Wars)-European major factions/civilisations like the Austrians, the Swede, the Poles, the HRE, and so on-European ""minor"" factions between which most of the mentioned-above conflicts occured (e.g. the thirty years' war?)-I could go on for ages*I rate the vanilla 7/10, and Asian Dynasties 9/10. I liked the accuracy and dedication towards the Asian cultures and peoples, perhaps the crappiest part was that they didn't bother changing the town noise and sounds at all. I cannot say anything about the Warchiefs because I played the native factions very little and am myself not-so experienced with (post-colonisation) north and mesoamerican civilisations.Many by now are probably already thinking that the review is pointless because ""muh europe"", but hey, we successfully founded the first advanced civilisations, kingdoms and later empires - ultimately colonising the world. So, whether you like that or not it's history, and we're a large part of it.Anyway, if you want to know how good the game is, just read older and more rated reviews. I can simply tell you that if you're looking after a traditional RTS set right after the middle ages until the beginning of the 19th century, you won't be disappointed at all. In case you agree with me on the lack of the European content, I highly recommend you install the Napoleonic Era mod[www.ne.elpea.net]. It adds some 5/6 factions and a bunch of units, maps, etc. It also has a small online community.			"

												Haven't played it in years. Got this one and age of empires 2. Its a must buy on steam regardless if you play it or not. We need a new age of empires four, or maybe age of empires 2, but with 100 times the map size.  You can make women do whatever you feel like. Your villagers are your slaves.  You can gather them up and throw them at the enemy as a distraction while your main force attacks your enemie castle line. Or charge with you main force and distract their army while you send a hundred villagers to swarm and destroy everything in their town square. DOn't think just do it.

												A very entertaining and balanced RTS. It is probably my favourite RTS out there. I find that the home cities/ shipments mechanic really adds a cool dynamic that is completely unique to AoEIII. Each European faction has similar core units (hussars, musketmen, ect) but each has a few unique units and upgrade paths, similar to AoEII. However each of the expansion factions look and play completely unique from the rest of the factions. 9/10 hard AI can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sometimes			"

												One of the best new features in AoEIII is unfortunately also the one that keeps me from enjoying it as much as I have enjoyed other games in the series. The introduction of the Home City was a pretty radical departure for the series, introducing persistent leveling to your favorite civilizations, with immediate and powerful gameplay modifications tailored by you to enhance and compliment your playstyle. On the one hand, this feature works great and is very enjoyable, as you pick and choose 'cards' before going into each match, which might upgrade your units, or your production, or they might give you free units, or unlock abilities. On the other hand, you'll quickly realize that each civilization has its own Home City and you have to play each and every one of them for dozens of matches if you want to competitively play all of them. If you have one or two favorite civs that you'll be playing all the time then that's no problem; you can focus on your favorites and be happy as a clam. If you enjoy playing them all though, and are a fan of the Random Civ option from previous games, then the removal of that feature and the introduction of persistence may irritate you.Other than that, all I'd have to say is that this is a great RTS, with good campaigns, good civilization variety, artwork, music, sound design, gameplay, and scenario editor. Highly recommended.			"

												This is the best Age of Empires game and one of the best strategy games of all time. Ships are big and beefy, cannons are cannons that do huge damage and splash and each civilization is unique. In AoE 2, you have crossbowmen shooting arrows at stone walls, battering rams hitting farm fields and making them burn, and swordsmen using their swords to beat down structures. In AoE 3, units have their own siege attacks and animations which fix that problem. Every civ's Church or religious building is a different model. Every civ has their own unique units and tech trees.The Explorer is your colony's leader and sort of a hero-like unit from Warcraft 3. You get to explore the map, fight neutrals and claim treasures during the start of the game, which makes games less repetitve and more fun in the beginning.The Home City part of the game is awesome. You can send shipments or technologies from your mother country to your colony. Every civ has a ton of different strategies.Each map is different enough. Most maps have Native people and settlements that you can trade with or ally. Your mother country will give you additional support on some maps, like early shipments or free economic starting buildings. There are also trade routes that you can establish.The game has good balance, almost rock-paper-scissors, with various types of infantry, cavalry and artillery. Also, farms and plantations do not need to be 'queued' like in AoE 2, fixing any annoyance from that game.In conclusion, AoE 3 is the most improved and well made Age of Empires yet. Every civilization is unique and all the annoying or bad features from the previous Age of Empires series games have been fixed. Each time you play will be different and every civ has different strategies. The maps are all different. My favorite part of the game is the sound of distant artillery, which echoes far! This is a great game and I am glad it is on steam, now it will continue to be supported!			"

												One of my favourite childhood games. Age Of Empires III is an fantastic game even for one of the older games, it's definetely one of the best older games you'll find here on Steam!Select between many countries and defend your home city/colony in skirmish mode, play online multiplayer with up to 8 players! Create a home city and level up to customize it! Make cities, forts, and train soldiers and war ships to defend your base with over 35 new maps to try out and explore! Create your own heroic explorer for your country and use him/her in skirmish mode!Play the exciting 3 original campaigns stories with 2 new campaign stories to enjoy with the DLCS installed!There is loads to do in this game and it just never get's old, always loved playing this game. One of my all time favourite!In-game music is great and the graphics are pretty good and you can create your own levels/maps with the scenario editor! Have fun using brand new hilarious cheat console commands lol :-DClassic World war game, much fun and is absolutely fantastic! Best age of empires game by a long shot!This is a must have game for your steam library!This is a really great game this but I would most like to see an James Cameron Avatar, the Hobbit, and an How to train your dragon age of empires game as well, be even cooler :-D10/10Game Rating: PG (Mild Violence)Catagory: Adventure, Strategy			"

												This is By FAR my favorite game of all time! Ive Been playing this game since it came out (on and off of course). Now even as an adult 10 years later I still have yet to find a game that compares. The graphics are still high quality and The gameplay is awesome! If you enjoy the RTS genre and havent tried this, you have seriously been missing out!!!! The things i would do for an AOE IV are unspeakable. MS please please please i beg of you atleast sell the rights or something.  I cannot accept the answer that there is no money in it. I mean the AOE2 and 3 communities are still alive after YEARS.  How could there not be interest!?			"

												A very entertaining and balanced RTS. It is probably my favourite RTS out there. I find that the home cities/ shipments mechanic really adds a cool dynamic that is completely unique to AoEIII. Each European faction has similar core units (hussars, musketmen, ect) but each has a few unique units and upgrade paths, similar to AoEII. However each of the expansion factions look and play completely unique from the rest of the factions. 9/10 hard AI can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sometimes			"

												One of the best new features in AoEIII is unfortunately also the one that keeps me from enjoying it as much as I have enjoyed other games in the series. The introduction of the Home City was a pretty radical departure for the series, introducing persistent leveling to your favorite civilizations, with immediate and powerful gameplay modifications tailored by you to enhance and compliment your playstyle. On the one hand, this feature works great and is very enjoyable, as you pick and choose 'cards' before going into each match, which might upgrade your units, or your production, or they might give you free units, or unlock abilities. On the other hand, you'll quickly realize that each civilization has its own Home City and you have to play each and every one of them for dozens of matches if you want to competitively play all of them. If you have one or two favorite civs that you'll be playing all the time then that's no problem; you can focus on your favorites and be happy as a clam. If you enjoy playing them all though, and are a fan of the Random Civ option from previous games, then the removal of that feature and the introduction of persistence may irritate you.Other than that, all I'd have to say is that this is a great RTS, with good campaigns, good civilization variety, artwork, music, sound design, gameplay, and scenario editor. Highly recommended.			"

Gunpowder units are unrealistically weak, samurai's and dopplesoldners can slice through musketeers with ease.3. Ships overlapping with each other : looks unfinished.4. Can't customise home cities in expansions.5. Skirmish does not allow multiple players with the same civilization.Good Points:I spent 100+ hours on scenario editor. LOLZ!!! Score : 7/10 "

												Still one of the best RTS games I know.I only wish they remastered this or made AoE 4 (never ever happening)Anyway, I'll take what I can get.The single player campaign is long and interesting, also both of the DLC add more campaign and civilizations to play as.Even the multiplayer community is still somewhat alive, though I usually just play with my friends and bots.If you're used to Age of Empires 2, this game will seem a little confusing as it introduces some new mechanics, one being the ""home city"" system.This system allows you to get free shipments to your war, like a bunch of soldiers, boats, buildings or even castles.Along with that, you also spice up the game with an explorer, a special scout/hero who you can use to gather treasure and other bounties of nature. Overall a comfy RTS game, even if it's gradually becoming outdated.It's well worth the sale price.This is recommendation is coming from someone who has played the game for atleast five hundred hours.

												An awesome game.Pros:- It has a shallow learning curve making it very easy for anyone to play.- A large selection of units allows you to build a very customisable & efficient army.- Stunning visuals even for a game that came out years ago.- Wide variety of units, unit types and upgrades - AOE3 allows users to participate in naval battles as well as land.- You can build items such as huge upgradable walls and towers to give your city that 'Empire' feel.- Mulitplayer is still alive and kickingCons:- For a game that came out in 2009, the price tag is high. I'd wait till it's on sale.- AI can be a bit tedious- In multiplayer, players are free to leave mid-game without repecussions.- Lag and frame drop become evident during large muliplayer battles as players can have 200 units each (thats a lot in a 8 player game)Neutral:- Multiplayer games can last a long time ranging from a 20 minute game to a 3hr game.- Hosts tend to choose bias teams during matchmaking.- Single player is a little too easyOverall, an 8.5. I recommend this game purely for the multiplayer aspect. It's just a shame Esemble studios, the developer, was cut loose from Microsoft.			"

And the following games in the generation don't fail to impress either. Age of Empires 3 is not only one of my favorite Strategy games of all time, it should be somewhere on your list too. This game brings endless hours of gameplay in singleplayer. Don't like playing by yourself? A03 has a pretty decent-sized community so you can play head-to-head with other players just like you. Got 40 bucks laying atound? Want to play an amazing RTS game? This game can fix both problems.			"

												This is a great game, if you ever consider picking this game up, or have the money to... DO IT. I've played countless hours of this game on disk and on steam, It's simple mechanics but hard to master strategies will leave you coming back for more. Also age of empires II is really good as well, but this one has a soft spot in my heart. Also, one last thing. Prussia Master Race!			"

												It's a fantastic experience  how you never stop learning new things about this mysterious explorer lost in the new world..The way you feel when you start the game for the first time, and you have to build those silly towncenters and you have no clue of what they do.How scared you are at first raid, when the enemy trashtalks to you for the first time.When you figure out which keys do what, and why.How you get to feel when you figure out how to play.When you figure out what goes where and why, and why it shouldn't go somewhere else.When you figure out how to play your favorite civilization, you feel surreal...The sadness that fills you, as your first  settler (that you became so attached to) slowly dies , and you cannot do anything becouse the enemy is in the Imperial Age already..When you have to make a new one..When you figure out that you are lost, you hit the resign button..When you achieve defeat... you feel like you are worthless..But then.. you realize you have to do it again..And the old feelings become new.

												Hooh boy, AoEIII. A very good contender for my favourite RTS game ever, and definitely somewhere in my top 10 games of all time. As a game? I would definitely recommend it to anybody who hasn't played and has the capacity to play. The lack of requiring a storehouse or similar structure to gather resources is a welcome addition, especially for me who often finds it tedious to construct a lumber camp every hour or so in aoeII. It's fairly easy compared to its later installments; i won a Moderate game with the Trade Monopoly condition in about two hours or so. But this version... it's basically the same minus a few upgrades, and doesn't really justify a $40 price tag 10 years after its release. It's also a little glitchier than the store version. I also can't get it and Steam to syncronize, which I was looking forward to and was primarily why i bought the game from steam. Get it if your current version doesn't work anymore or you've never played before, as AOEIII is a really fun experience, but if your current version works on your computer, I'd give this one a skip.

What I like about it:- eco and micro managing the fights are both important- there are loads of viable strategies- there is more than 1 resource (!!!) wich makes managing economy more demanding- the historical setup with the unit types artillery, cavallery, infantery makes it easier to understand strength and weaknesses of each unit. For instance, it makes totally sense that artillery beats hand infantery, whereas I cannot figure out that easy why one alien is better than another alien in a futuristic or fantasy RTS.			"

												10/10 would age again...Best game ever, like honestly I love this game. This game stresses your multitasking and reaction to your opponents strategy. All while doing your own. Would certainly recommend you get this game. Easy to play, nearly impossible to master. Also AI is very good and considering how old this game is the graphics are what you would expect from a new game if you crank the resolution very high and max everything out. You need a fairly powerful PC to do so but the bright side is you can play on a fairly underpowered computer if you are not gaming on your main rig. 10/10 would age again.			"

												Nowhere near as good as good as it's last installment, Age Of Empires II (HD edition is on steam). However, it still holds up now. Ragdolling soldiers with Cannons never gets old. Also it has a decent fictional story which spans a few hundred years.My advice: while I recommend this to someone who just loves RST and plays every single one they can get thier hands on, this will be a treat. There are definately better ones however.A few to consider are: Age Of MythologyAge Of Empires IIStarCraftStarwars: Empire at WarEnjoy,			"

												Dont let my steam gametime fool you, i have nearly a hundred hours on this game non steam.Well, it is different from AoE2, thats for damn sure. If you are a hardcore AoE2 fan, chances are you won't like this game. There is some RPG elements, you win experience points and you use them to level up your home city and get different bonuses and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Campaign is decent. "

Age of Empires 3 Complete Collection ReviewAge of Empires 3 Complete Collection is a nice bundle for RTS fans that offers many hours of gameplay. I have been a fan of this series from its beginning. In fact, Age of Empires (the original) was my first PC gaming experience ever and a big reason why I switched from console to PC. If you enjoy this game then I recommend picking up Age of Empires 2 HD and Age of Empres Gold as well. Now, let's get on with the review.Age of Empires 3 is a lot different than its predecessors. Aside from improvements on graphics, it introduces several new features to the series. Home cities are a huge addition to the game. Players get to tinker around and spend upgrade points on their Home Cities to change the appearance of the buildings and environment, but more importantly, during each mission map you are able to receive a variety of shipments (resources, settlers, army troops) from them that help you achieve your goals. These shipments are selected from another new feature, a deck of cards. Players can build custom decks of cards that are somewhat unique to the civilization they are playing as they gain experience from missions played. The shipments you receive from your Home City are based on the deck the player chooses to use prior to beginning each new map.Another new feature is the addition of hero-type units based on the chosen civilization that regenerate health and can perform special abilities. A few new buildings have been added to enhance gameplay in a variety of ways: the fort, the factory, the capitol, and the plantation.  Maps now contain a few new features as well. Players will find treasure locations scattered across each map that can give a variety of rewards. Also, maps now contain ""trading routes"" that enable players to gain additional experience (used for receiving shipments from Home Cities) or resources once building a trading post along the route in designated areas. The new features added into Age of Empires 3 are integrated extremely well. They enhance overall gameplay and are not just thrown in hastily just to add something different. The bundle contains the base game, the Asian Dynasties expansion, and The War Chiefs expansion. Each of these contain lengthy campaigns to keep players entertained for hours. There is also a new multiplayer feature that players have been wanting for a long time (they even added multiplayer to AoE2). Overall, this game is really great. It plays smoothly on most all systems and is virtually bug-free as it should be since its been on the market for a long time.As with any game, there are some setbacks though. Firstly, it is way too expensive for a game this old. There is a lot of game content included in the bundle but its still not worth paying full price in the Steam store. It doesn't go on sale often but I recommend waiting till it does or else find a 66% off coupon for it. Secondly, players who have previously played other AoE games will find that the maps are much smaller and cramped up compared to the oher franchise releases. To compensate for this, the developers decided to include hefty population costs for various troops. This means that the days of having a huge army to overwhelm your opponent is a thing of the past. The city-building aspect has also been dummied down to the basics which will take some of the enjoyment out of the game for a few. Resources collected by settlers now go straight into the stockpile instead of needing to be deposited at resource collecting points, which takes some of the realism away from the game. Research is still included in the game but is not as intriguing as in the original games. Most notably, there isn't much diversity in the civilizations offered. The troops and research options seem to be the same regardless of which civilization is chosen. The map editor tool feature used to create custom maps and campaigns is no longer included so don't expect a lot of new player-made content to add even more life to the game. And lastly, only two types of smirmishes are available compared to the four types in the previous versions.The Good:========+  3D graphics with rich detail+  Smooth gameplay and controls+  Offered in a bundle+  Quality DLC content+  Great storyline and 3 full campigns+  Numerous new features to enhance gameplay+  High replay value+  Numerous patches to fix bugs from initial release+  Multiplayer online play availableThe Bad:======-  Extremely over-priced for a dated game-  Small player maps-  Limited Skirmish Options-  Simple tech tree-  Civilizations lack true diversity-  Its not Age of Empires 2Final Thoughts:===========Overall, Age of Empires 3 is a fun game that will keep players busy for numerous hours and I recommend it to all RTS game lovers as long as you can pick it up on sale. However, don't load it up and expect it to be anything close to  the other Ensemble Studios titles. In general, the game feels generic and simplistic compared to other games such as Age of Empires 2 or Age of Mythology. Instead, it offers a different style of play due to the numerous new features added and for that reason its worth playing.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												Age of Empire III: Complete Collection contains the base game and two expansion packs: The War Chiefs & Asian Dynasties. This is a good deal for any RTS player. Like Age of Mythology the game is in 3D, so you can rotate the scenario, zoom in and out.There are also some addition features added, so each colony can have special perks (They are called Cards in the game) that you can add and remove so your colony is specialized for a certain map or warfare. This is something you can do before you start a match.My only gripe is that there is no Steam Workshop support. I know this game was released before Valve even created it, but it would be awesome if Hidden Path Entertainment (the guys who worked on Age of Empire II HD Edition) could add it. It's not a big deal since the base game looks beautiful graphically speaking and the sound is superb.The game also contains a scenario editor, so you can create extra content and share it with others, but not via Steam Workshop.Three words: Buy. This. Game.Peace.			"

												This is the game that gave me my love for both strategy and History itself.  Until I got Civilization V, this game was by far my most played strategy game.  You get to fight in the New World or Asia as you build up resorces, construct an army, and conquer your neighbors!  Though I feel the game should add more factions to play like Sweden, Austria, or Denmark to add to to the already great experience (without the need of a mod) and the ability to fight in Europe!  Also, if you're a person who doesn't like to win legitimently, then look of some of the cheats, the're hilarious!  Also, the AI difficulty is very spaced out between easy, moderate, and hard, unlike some games that have easy WAY too easy, medium has a massive jump from easy, and hard is nearly impossible.  Great choice if you're a stategy fan.			"

Cards add an even further element of strategy as you're able to carry out a designated or set game plan before the game even starts. Extremely unique and different civilizations, making the game an almost unlimited source of entertainment. Only mishaps are with the multiplayer as it can be laggy at times, and microing in this game seems awkward compared to games such as WC3 or SC2.			"

												 I would say no because of the price tag, but this has to be one of the best RTSs that I have ever played. I can play this for hours. All the diferent things you can do. You can have a one-on-one battle with AI or maybe you would perfer an eight-on-eight battle with you friend. You can do what ever you feel like. On the other side, the AI is quite persistent. I have had times when they wiped out my partner then nonstop attaked me. I ended up having to surender because I didn't have time to build an army. I highly recomend this game to anyone who has the patience and time to sit through an hour-two hour game.			"

												One of my favorite strategy games of all time.  It's almost a decade old, yet I still find time to play it.Campaign:  8/10  The base game's campaign is broken up into three stories loosely connected via the characters.  The level designs are creative and the gameplay is always engaging.  For first time players, the campaigns are a good place to learn the intricacies of the game.Skirmishes:  9/10  The base game has 8 or 9 ""Home Cities"" to choose from, each with unique units, buildings, etc.  Each Home City gains experience independently, so there is no shortage of game to be played.  The map selection is very diverse, especially if you indulge in the expansion packs.  The AI can be a little idiotic at easier difficulties, but challenging at harder ones.  The only fault I find with the gameplay is the lack of diversity among the units available.  Each Home City has access to a different combination of a dozen or so units, each with a specific purpose in your armies, so if you opponent is building mostly cavalry, you just build anti-cavalry units.  This can become stale after several games.Graphics:  8/10  What can I say?  The game looks great, especially considering its age.  The building models are great and 'evolve' as you age up in-game.  The landscape and scenery are very well detailed, notably the water and trees.  The game even has some physics involved when you attack buildings and the buildings fall apart.  The only fault I find with the graphics are the character models, which dont have idle animations and have identical faces, uniforms, etc.  Overall, I give this game a solid 85/100.  You might get bored of it, butonly after many hours of rewarding gameplay.  By the way, the soundtrack is fantastic.			"

PROS:+ fun campaign stories+ nice building & unit variety+ AoE look+ XP system+ fun multiplayer+ two cool expansionsCONS:- simplified building & resource gathering- home base cards- the unit formations are useless- lacks stuff that would make this game iconic like the first twoComment:Do not be fooled by the hours played I have displayed here as I have played many many more. So to this date this is the last AoE games made. It has lots of new stuff and is very inovative from the first two...and yet...a bit boring compared to them. For some reason the developers simplified building stuff and gathering resources then they added home cards and reinforcements. At first it looked cool. But as you play it somehow distracts you, from the game, from the upgrades selectable in the buildings. It lost the AoE charm. By no means is this a bad game! But it falls short even with the great War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties expansion packs. I truly do recommend this as a RTS game because it is good, but it just lacks something to be really great...

												Age of Empires 3 is an RTS classic, the (unfortunately) last game in the Age of Empires' series installment, was brilliant for it's time, and definitely still can count itself among the best classic RTS' out there, even according to the standards of today for that genre in particular, as well as the Strategy genre as a whole.Aside from this, the game also has an interesting shipment system, which is quite unique, and spices up the game, that is not even mentioning all of the different units, from the different civilizations and their playstyles.The graphics are beginning to show their age, but nevertheless are still quite good, and decent to look at.The AI, though a bit rudimentary, at hard difficulty can easily prove to be quite a challenge, especially if you are fighting the French with the Napoleon personality (viva la Baguette?).The game is not supported anymore, due to it's age, however, you can easily through third party programs like GameRanger find and play multiplayer games online.Oh, and remember to launch the game through Asian Dynasties, as you would otherwise not be able to access the content of all of the DLCs and their content at the same time.

												A new world, new adventures, and a new beginning...Following the successful Age of Empires franchise is AOE III, now wonderfully remastered into one complete pack on Steam. This is a must-get for not just AOE fans, but fans of strategy games in general. Age of Empires III is a strong example of what makes the AOE series a classic in RTS games. From micro to macro-management, housekeeping to empire building, the game is easy to learn yet difficult to master.The game is set in the 17th thru 19th centuries when European nations expanded their dominions and colonies across the world. On the other side of the globe, Native American civilizations fight to survive or adapt to European incursion, and Asian civilizations cautiously open their borders to a foreign and strange culture. From large musketeer battles to cavalry charges, and artillery blasting away at mortar and brick, the game is a visual delight to relish.			"

												Even though I'm only speaking on behalf of the campaign, it is an excellent primer for RTS noobs that teaches you the fundamentals of resource management and iconic series combat through a host of interesting scenarios. The plots in all of the campaigns are funny because of how linear and predictable they are, but you'll get to a point where you're more engaged with the elements of gameplay. I'd highly encourage this game to be the one in the franchise to start out in if only because it has an easy mode unlike its unforgiving brother AoE II. Some minor gripes about this game would be unintelligent friendly AI (you have to direct them to do everything, even attack enemies that are 4 feet away), audio desynch issues with cutscenes, and lack of steam workshop integration. If mythology and II have it, why not this one? All in all it's a steal for the sale price.			"

												It's AoE 3.Granted, tis' not the one that is the most popular in the series (compared to 2, AoM, or even the first one), but there's a lot of replay value when they introduced the card system. You can tweak it to your liking, whether that works or not. They also integrated one of the game modes that I used to play (xx minutes no rush) into the actual game as a game mode, which is fantastic if you like to build up economies and then clash with big arimes on the field. You can also have large navy fights that I haven't seen in a RTS except for the Empire Earth series. Very fun and replayable.			"

												I had forgotten just how good this game was. Like many people i'd bought it years ago, only to find my playing days cut short thanks to it being incompatible with Windows Vista onwards. Not any more! I can confirm the Steam version works perfectly on my Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit system.Fans of the first two games will immediately be able to dive straight in, although there have been some major changes in the third installment compared to the first two. Firstly there's not so much emphasis on micro management now. Instead you get to concentrate on the exploration and battle elements, which makes this game the most enjoyable of the three. Secondly there is the new home city section which allows you to ship units and supplies to the new world during the game. Between games you can customise your home city to change which units and supplies can be sent out to you, along with the appearance of the city itself.Visually this game absolutely trounces the two previous games, and indeed almost any other game in the genre, it is graphically amazing. Sound-wise it's not much different to the first two, with the sound being good but not excellent, and not too intrusive. The campaign isn't too difficult, so the greater challenge will come from skirmish games (rather like Age of Mythology... indeed all previous comparisons to the first two Age of Empires games also apply to Age of Mythology).If you did not have this game before, you really owe it to yourself to buy it now that the compatibility problems have been sorted out and it works fine on Windows 8, 7 and presumably Vista as well. If, like me, you already had this game but could not play it because of those compatibility problems, well i can now confirm that those problems have been solved! This game deserves to be in everyone's collection.			"

												This is the game that gave me my love for both strategy and History itself.  Until I got Civilization V, this game was by far my most played strategy game.  You get to fight in the New World or Asia as you build up resorces, construct an army, and conquer your neighbors!  Though I feel the game should add more factions to play like Sweden, Austria, or Denmark to add to to the already great experience (without the need of a mod) and the ability to fight in Europe!  Also, if you're a person who doesn't like to win legitimently, then look of some of the cheats, the're hilarious!  Also, the AI difficulty is very spaced out between easy, moderate, and hard, unlike some games that have easy WAY too easy, medium has a massive jump from easy, and hard is nearly impossible.  Great choice if you're a stategy fan.			"

Only mishaps are with the multiplayer as it can be laggy at times, and microing in this game seems awkward compared to games such as WC3 or SC2.			"

To elaborate a little on my original review, when this game came out, I was a die hard AOE 2 fan still, and a lot of the mechanics in this game (the cards especially) I saw as a gimmick. I figured they had just run out of ideas or something. Thankfully, I was wrong, I haven't played enough of this to say more but its definitely a good buy.			"

												This game is fun, I love the essence of strategy. The only problem is you'll have to know what your're doing if you want to win the game. But besides that, the graphics are pretty good, the story mode is intriguing, and you get to play on multiplayer and blow up people's buildings and men from around the world!			"

History + action + strategyA bit underrated if you like history and RTS. Basically, you load up a map, gather resources, build buildings, train armies, etc., etc. Great diversity of nations, tactics and unique units/bldgs/techs.You can capture trade routes and mini-civs (""villages"") on many maps. Easy to customize multi and, when the game's balanced and playing right, it's a thrilling challenge. If you're the creative kind, you can dig into the editor and pretty quickly start creating your own maps, scenarios and cinematics. If you loved Age of Empires 2, this is an easy recommendation. Graphics hold up well - the game still looks gorgeous on a good rig.			"

												""This is my opinion so you cant Critique is"" ok so now that we've gotten that out of the way I would like to admit that when it comes to real time strategy. Age of Empires 3 has always held a special place in my heart. I've played since the first AOE so just liking what I have is not a thing here. I genuinly see this as an improvement and large innovation in the series. The pace is nice, and the fact that resources gather so long as your settler are gathering is a nice change that speeds up the game. the addition of deck and shipments is also very fun allowing multple builds for nations and different ways to play your nation no matter what you play. The base nations alone are also well made. some balancing is an issue as it is with most unsupported games but each nation feels different and has a new way to play and thrive. IE Russian= numbers over strength, France= cavalry and defense. There's quite a few ways to play your nation so don't be too focused on the ""meta"". Trade routes and native alliances make a nice change as well, most native upgrades are helpful and give you a reason to explore the map and find native settlements. Frankly the game I see here is great and I wish the community was larger rather than focusing on the past of AOE 2. The changes are well done and keep the game fresh.If you're a fan of RTS's I would highly recomend playing this game. especially is you found AOE 2 to be a bit slow and lacking.			"

PROS:+ fun campaign stories+ nice building & unit variety+ AoE look+ XP system+ fun multiplayer+ two cool expansionsCONS:- simplified building & resource gathering- home base cards- the unit formations are useless- lacks stuff that would make this game iconic like the first twoComment:Do not be fooled by the hours played I have displayed here as I have played many many more. So to this date this is the last AoE games made. It has lots of new stuff and is very inovative from the first two...and yet...a bit boring compared to them. For some reason the developers simplified building stuff and gathering resources then they added home cards and reinforcements. At first it looked cool. But as you play it somehow distracts you, from the game, from the upgrades selectable in the buildings. It lost the AoE charm. By no means is this a bad game! But it falls short even with the great War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties expansion packs. I truly do recommend this as a RTS game because it is good, but it just lacks something to be really great...

												Great game for RTS fans, It has an amazing multiplayer mode. I personally only play treaty NR40 which is 40 minutes without attacking but most people play with just attacking at the start. Honestly the diversity in the civs and units is great there are no civs that arent usuable in anything. Every civ has its own advantages and disadvantages and while there are a few that are clearly somewhat overpowered you will find that players will often host ""No OP"" Lobbies where you can really play whatever you want.

Constructing your battles is intense and unique. The single player campaign is lacking but who the ♥♥♥♥ likes campaign in a strategy game.Pros:-Lots of fun-Lots to do-A unique twist on an awesome seriesCons:-DLC required for the full experince-Gets repetitive-Low amount of people online-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So overall this game is a game you should  buy on sale it is not worth the 43 dollars in todays market maybe 3 years ago but not today.

												Age of Empires III: complete Collection is a small compilation consisting of Age of Empires III and the two expansion packs. I already recommend buying this over the retail version since there was an issue with it. If one was to purchase Age of Empires III then War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties retail, it would only allow the use of Asian Dynasties OR War Chiefs. So, one pro is that both expansions can be played at the same time.GameplayAge of Empires III is an RTS that is set in colonial times. What is most appealing about the game is the beautiful graphics for the time and the amount of replayability. The effort that was placed in each nation was specific and displayed the obvious strengths and weaknesses of each nation after some experience. For example, one nation might be unable to build a tower type build, but have a unit or another building that allows better protection against enemies. This also limits the player somewhat since not all nations can just wall up and defend well like in Age of Empires or Age of Empires II. StoryNot much to say on this subject as the story is loosily based on true events and is sub-par at best. To say the least, you would probably play through it once and never touch it again.VisualsThe audio is superb and feels right. The gun shots of the muskets don't sound like bb guns or anything, the ambient music is relaxing, and combat has its own fast paced music as well. Graphic wise, the game is very beautiful and seems to bring out the environments of the real world. Overall, I would recommend this game to long time fans of the series or fans of RTS games.			"

												Even though I'm only speaking on behalf of the campaign, it is an excellent primer for RTS noobs that teaches you the fundamentals of resource management and iconic series combat through a host of interesting scenarios. The plots in all of the campaigns are funny because of how linear and predictable they are, but you'll get to a point where you're more engaged with the elements of gameplay. I'd highly encourage this game to be the one in the franchise to start out in if only because it has an easy mode unlike its unforgiving brother AoE II. Some minor gripes about this game would be unintelligent friendly AI (you have to direct them to do everything, even attack enemies that are 4 feet away), audio desynch issues with cutscenes, and lack of steam workshop integration. If mythology and II have it, why not this one? All in all it's a steal for the sale price.			"

												It's AoE 3.Granted, tis' not the one that is the most popular in the series (compared to 2, AoM, or even the first one), but there's a lot of replay value when they introduced the card system. You can tweak it to your liking, whether that works or not. They also integrated one of the game modes that I used to play (xx minutes no rush) into the actual game as a game mode, which is fantastic if you like to build up economies and then clash with big arimes on the field. You can also have large navy fights that I haven't seen in a RTS except for the Empire Earth series. Very fun and replayable.			"

												This is the game that gave me my love for both strategy and History itself.  Until I got Civilization V, this game was by far my most played strategy game.  You get to fight in the New World or Asia as you build up resorces, construct an army, and conquer your neighbors!  Though I feel the game should add more factions to play like Sweden, Austria, or Denmark to add to to the already great experience (without the need of a mod) and the ability to fight in Europe!  Also, if you're a person who doesn't like to win legitimently, then look of some of the cheats, the're hilarious!  Also, the AI difficulty is very spaced out between easy, moderate, and hard, unlike some games that have easy WAY too easy, medium has a massive jump from easy, and hard is nearly impossible.  Great choice if you're a stategy fan.			"

It took some time to get used to the whole cards thing, but once you get past that, its all good.2017 Edit: I would still recommend this game today, but if it was a ""one or the other"" situation, I'd recommend taking a look at AOE 2: HD. To elaborate a little on my original review, when this game came out, I was a die hard AOE 2 fan still, and a lot of the mechanics in this game (the cards especially) I saw as a gimmick. I figured they had just run out of ideas or something. Thankfully, I was wrong, I haven't played enough of this to say more but its definitely a good buy.			"

Only mishaps are with the multiplayer as it can be laggy at times, and microing in this game seems awkward compared to games such as WC3 or SC2.			"

The complete collection offers massive replayability, and I can atest to that as I am still not bored with this game.			"

												Hands down will go down as one of the best RTS games created. The depth of the campaign storylines makes for amazing experiences, the maps have great detail with more options in the game than the previous chapters. As for the online features sadly the mode has decreased much with people playing it but you will still get games. Overall it is a great game and I would highly recommend it.			"

												First of all let me say that I love Real-Time Strategy games and consider myself kinda an authority on them.  If you like old school RTS, then you’ll love this!  I love how your city ""levels-up"", so even if you loose a game, you still gain something form the experence.Multiplayer is where it is at  :)			"

												AoE 3 is a pretty decent historical fiction RTS.  The game takes place mostly around the frontier days, with the exception of the Asian Dynasty pack.  I'll be talking a lot about that expansion because it's vastly different from the rest of the game.  Voice acting is decent, as are the stories, predictable though they are.  The music is catchy but highly repetitive.  85% of the game has no chill.  While it's not really all that challenging on Normal difficulty, most of the missions in the game have some kind of time or mechanical constraint that prevent them from being standard ""build then destroy"" affairs.  Normally I wouldn't complain about this, but themes are re-used so much that they quickly grow old.  ""Oh, I don't start off with a base again.""  ""Oh, I can't get any villagers again.""  ""Oh, I don't get any resources so I have to use trading posts again.""  So on and so forth.  The UI is kind of bad.  It eats up a third of my screen on 1080p, and hotkeys (of which there are many) aren't discernible via mouseovers of the buttons, so you wind up having to go back into the Options menu repeatedly if you want to use them.  Attack-move seemed not to work properly for me, which was very noticeable but not a dealbreaker.  Asian Dynasties involved very different mechanics.  Minus the UI, the production value, and a couple of buildings/progressions, it was almost different enough to be another RTS.  Some of the alterations were neat, others were bizarre.  If you play the Chinese faction during Skirmish mode, they can't build any common soldiers until they Age Up (upgrade the town hall), only siege units.  I'm sorry, what?  Whose brilliant idea was that?  You see, although there are many factions, there are really only four styles in the game:  European, Japanese, Chinese, and Indian.  It's not merely a difference in units, or buildings, but the fundamental mechanics of how they work.  Because I didn't spend a lot of hours in Skirmish mode, it's impossible for me to say if the game is balanced, but I doubt it.Something that appealed to me were the farming/shipment mechanics.  There's food, wood, coin, and a separate export resource if you're playing Asian Dynasties.  The way it's handled, however, you can build farms or receive shipments that are slow, infinite pools of any of those things.  If you run out of wild animals to hunt, build a farm or raise livestock.  If you run out of gold, plantations or rice paddies are infinite.   Wood is more difficult, but Asian Dynasties allows you to plant groves, or you can receive shipments in any case.  As a result, resource-management in the game is a lot less stressful than pretty much any RTS I've played.  Another thing that stood out is the ability to train stacks of five.  If you have the resources, you can train five troops in one building at once, and when it's finished five will pop out.  The need for multiple barracks is basically absent.  That's about everything that stood out for me.  I wouldn't pay 40 dollars for the game, wait for a decent sale, but it's definitely worth picking up for RTS fans if you don't mind historical backdrop.			"

												Some people prefer age of empires 2, but this still has got a lot of advantages and excellent updates, worthy to be considered a sequel. There is a lot less micromanaging of the unenjoyable kind as you can train 5 units at the speed of 1 and villagers don't have to travel back to resource drop off points. It feel more action packed and lacks the dull late game turtling that age of empires 2 would drive to. The AI can be an absolute retard at times but they can come up with excellent tactical decisions. I actually prefer this to AOE 2, and it certainly has made a lot of changes that makes it stand out with its independant identity within the AOE franchise.			"

												Age of Empires 3 takes an already established concept, and expands and improves it greatly.  The game features ""cards"" -upgrades that you can send whenever you reach another experiance tier.  Cards allow you to specialize your nations units, which are sharded between all of the nations, with one or two expections.  There are also playstyle differences between nations, with the ottomans getting free yet slow settlers, or the duty settlers costing gold instead of food.  The core gameplay is similar to AoE 2, other then this new card mechanic and trading posts.  Trading posts can be built on trade routes or on Indian villages.  Both of them are worth it.  Trade routes supply you with either resources or exp, and indian villages grant you powerful units and upgrades.  Overall, it is better then AoE 2, the card system is unique, and it is worth getting.			"

												A Timeless classic reborn in HD. The Age Of Empires series stands upon one of the three pillars of RTS royalty with the other two being Comand and Conquor and Dawn of War. AOE is one of those games you can spend hours on just fiddling away, building up a strong empire only to loose it when you win. But thats half the fun because you get to do it again. I often found myself building a strong base only to toy with my enemies before i crused them.In many aspects this game seems more ridgid and strict than the ones before, but on the whole i beleive it to be an improvement. With a single player campaign that i actually enjoyed playing this is my favourite in the series.A strong 8/10			"

												Okay, here's how it is. If you absolutley adore Age of Empires 2 and want a clone, don't play this. If you like StarCraft 2 or similair games, Play this. Nice story, nice graphics, decent gameplay. The multi-player is not very fun unless it's with friends. There is mild customization. Such as which nation to play in skirmish. The ""card system"" is a little odd, but effective if you like it.   I have seen all the bad reviews, they all hate that this game isn't AOE2. The game is simple. Spam musketeers and two cannons and you win. But the story is fun. The historical accuracy is off, but this is a video game, not a history lesson.

												8/10If you like the classic RTS style – that is building a base, collecting resources, amassing a giant army, and eventually crushing your opponent with massive amounts of soldiers – this is a great choice. It includes two expansion packs which extend the play time considerably. Graphics are a bit dated but look fine. You get a lot of game for your money and if you find it on sale don’t hesitate to buy. Single player missions are fun and somewhat varied in their objectives; it will take you a long time to finish. The challenge is decent but you probably won’t be failing too many missions.			"

												This game is a classic RTS experience which can be enjoyed by anyone from a novice right up to strategic masters, I have been playing this game since release and was so impressed by the amount of times I have returned to this game after a few months break has made it worth every penny for a re-purchase on steam. If you enjoy games that envolve collecting resources and a large quantity of military and economic micromanagement then this game is for you!The multiplayer is what makes this game fantastic, the community are amazing and the battles even more impressive. The graphics even to this day are impressive so this is not a game to hold back on and is very well optimised for even the oldest and slowest of computers, if your looking for a game to keep dragging you back, this is the it!My only comments on improvement would be the reliability of the servers as of recent, there has been a few times I have failed to connect (I know they have maintenance on tuesdays, good to see they are still keeping the servers updated!), but with a good NAT type this shouldn't be an issue!My Rating - 8/10			"

												Great game but I can't play the DLCs? Dynastys and The War Chiefs??UPDATE: I know the solution, Dont start the game from the shortcut. You have to select the game at your steam game list and press Right mouse button on it. Then you see the 2 expansion, Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties. Good luck and have fun playing the game!			"

												The card system of this game is amazing because it rewards aggressive play styles over turtling (with experience and trade route domination). Both early and late game are given equal chances to win a game.In the first games, rushing is only viable in 1v1 matches.This is a step up from Age of Empire 2. "

Age of Empires III is a great base-building RTS game for older and less powerful rigs.This game will run on almost any machine that will run Windows 10 as long as it has the space requirements met.  It's quick to load and easy to host/join.  It's not online-only.  It has single-player campaigns, one for the base game and one for each expansion, and it has LAN support.  (It has online features, too, though I never mess with that.)The game is real-time strategy or RTS at its core.  It offers a lot of resource-gathering options and many ways to creatively gain a foothold over your competition.  It also has hilarious cheats! If you don't care to cheat your way to victory but need an edge over everyone else on the battlefield, there is the handicap percentage.Why do I play this so often over all my other RTS games?My wife's laptop can't play much else.  That's the biggest reason.  We like playing strategy games cooperatively and AOE3 is one of the best-looking, most fun experiences we've got to work on her laptop.  Someday, I want to build her a gaming desktop out of my old parts so she can play newer, prettier RTS games.  Even then, we'll probably compare all of them to AOE3.			"

												Hands down will go down as one of the best RTS games created. The depth of the campaign storylines makes for amazing experiences, the maps have great detail with more options in the game than the previous chapters. As for the online features sadly the mode has decreased much with people playing it but you will still get games. Overall it is a great game and I would highly recommend it.			"

												I've played Age of Empires games for what feel like, well, ages. I felt that Age of Empires III was by far the best in terms of graphics, but the gameplay for the campaigns seemed a bit shorter than the previous games (at least it felt this way to me). Sometimes a win is determined by who has more resources and is able to get the largest fighting force, while other times you gotta think of the best plan of attack and use what you have to win. I would recomend this game. Now if only they would release Age of Mythology on Steam...that would be amazing; it's my favorite of these games and I do miss it so.			"

I love a game that makes you think, strategize, not just run around a map and shoot people. That's why I love this game. You have to think ""Whats going to be my next move?"" and then you have to think how will this affect your economy, your settlers, and most importantly your military. This game is also good because you can't just work on your town because you won't have a good military and vice versa. That's why I recommend this game.			"

												One of my all time favourites. Great strategy game. The campaign is nice, but the skirmish matches are the best. The bots AI is a bit too op on Expert mode (they always know where you are). There were multiple games where I had to ""migrate"" my settlers to my friends base, or just spent the whole game hiding from the bots (which, again, always find us). Here's a small list of weird funny matches I played on, mainly when I was just starting out and was a noob: - Against a french player, he made a square with his horses and placed one horse of a different type in the middle of the square. The square was incredible fast and basically destroyed all my buildings in under a minute- There was this one guy who made like 50 cannons (no other units) and they would simply destroy everything that I threw at them. After destroying my buildings he spent 10 minutes chasing my last settlers with his army of cannons.- On this one game after I was defeated my friend hid his explorer on a treasure, in a way that it wouldn't be visible from above. After getting to imperial and researching spies to see the whole map, they spent 15 min looking for him until his explorer attacked a settler passing nearby.It's a shame ESO online is terrible. The system is so old I can't even join a single game. This game would become so much better if there was a steam based multiplayer mode. As it is, I have to use gameranger to be able to play with my friends.Also worth mentioning, if you lose your password for ESO Online good luck retrieving it. I had an old copy of the game but couldn't remember the password, emailed microsoft, asked on the official forums and never got an answer. I then bought the game on steam only to find that I couldn't join online games...			"

												This was the first strategy game that I had ever played and having tried many, many others, this is always a treat to come back to. I first had it on a disc for mac but that computer broke years ago. I got a laptop quite recently and saw that there was a complete collection of the game. On sale, I couldn't resist coming back to it and it was worth it. The base game was good with easy, simple mechanics and a fair bit of content, without much range between countries (with the exception of the Ottomans and Russians). The expansions however, add a huge range of content, with vastly different playing styles for different countries and it's still very balanced.My favourite map remains Caribean but all of the new ones I have tried are very good too. I haven't gotten on to the new campaigns yet. The first campaigns weren't particularly compelling in story but the play modes are unique compared to the 'skirmish mode' so it's worth a play-through.This is an absolute classic of real time strategy games and it is deserved of any praise it gets.

												In my opinion, this is the best RTS, and perhaps best video game ever made. Despite being over a decade old, it still holds up as a great game which can be played over and over for hundreds, if not thousands of hours. The music and gameplay of this is excellent, and while the graphics may not be top-notch, they are decent for the game and allow it be played without much lag interruption. With 14 playable factions and multiple gamemodes, you'll stay interested and there is always something new to do with the excellent scenario making of this game.I would rate this game 10/10. It is a masterpiece.			"

Age of Empires III is a great base-building RTS game for older and less powerful rigs.This game will run on almost any machine that will run Windows 10 as long as it has the space requirements met.  It's quick to load and easy to host/join.  It's not online-only.  It has single-player campaigns, one for the base game and one for each expansion, and it has LAN support.  (It has online features, too, though I never mess with that.)The game is real-time strategy or RTS at its core.  It offers a lot of resource-gathering options and many ways to creatively gain a foothold over your competition.  It also has hilarious cheats! If you don't care to cheat your way to victory but need an edge over everyone else on the battlefield, there is the handicap percentage.Why do I play this so often over all my other RTS games?My wife's laptop can't play much else.  That's the biggest reason.  We like playing strategy games cooperatively and AOE3 is one of the best-looking, most fun experiences we've got to work on her laptop.  Someday, I want to build her a gaming desktop out of my old parts so she can play newer, prettier RTS games.  Even then, we'll probably compare all of them to AOE3.			"

												Age of Empires 3 takes an already established concept, and expands and improves it greatly.  The game features ""cards"" -upgrades that you can send whenever you reach another experiance tier.  Cards allow you to specialize your nations units, which are sharded between all of the nations, with one or two expections.  There are also playstyle differences between nations, with the ottomans getting free yet slow settlers, or the duty settlers costing gold instead of food.  The core gameplay is similar to AoE 2, other then this new card mechanic and trading posts.  Trading posts can be built on trade routes or on Indian villages.  Both of them are worth it.  Trade routes supply you with either resources or exp, and indian villages grant you powerful units and upgrades.  Overall, it is better then AoE 2, the card system is unique, and it is worth getting.			"

												I've played Age of Empires games for what feel like, well, ages. I felt that Age of Empires III was by far the best in terms of graphics, but the gameplay for the campaigns seemed a bit shorter than the previous games (at least it felt this way to me). Sometimes a win is determined by who has more resources and is able to get the largest fighting force, while other times you gotta think of the best plan of attack and use what you have to win. I would recomend this game. Now if only they would release Age of Mythology on Steam...that would be amazing; it's my favorite of these games and I do miss it so.			"

												The only negatives is that walls are so weak they're pretty much useless, and the population cap is ridiculously low.   Also, there aren't very many large maps.  AOE2 had stronger walls and unlimited population, which was great, but the graphics were pretty terrible.  The graphics on AOE3 are pretty decent.  I do wish there was a way we could zoom out more, though.  Otherwise, it's a pretty fun game.			"

Posted: March 1, 2016
												AoE 3 is a pretty decent historical fiction RTS.  The game takes place mostly around the frontier days, with the exception of the Asian Dynasty pack.  I'll be talking a lot about that expansion because it's vastly different from the rest of the game.  Voice acting is decent, as are the stories, predictable though they are.  The music is catchy but highly repetitive.  85% of the game has no chill.  While it's not really all that challenging on Normal difficulty, most of the missions in the game have some kind of time or mechanical constraint that prevent them from being standard ""build then destroy"" affairs.  Normally I wouldn't complain about this, but themes are re-used so much that they quickly grow old.  ""Oh, I don't start off with a base again.""  ""Oh, I can't get any villagers again.""  ""Oh, I don't get any resources so I have to use trading posts again.""  So on and so forth.  The UI is kind of bad.  It eats up a third of my screen on 1080p, and hotkeys (of which there are many) aren't discernible via mouseovers of the buttons, so you wind up having to go back into the Options menu repeatedly if you want to use them.  Attack-move seemed not to work properly for me, which was very noticeable but not a dealbreaker.  Asian Dynasties involved very different mechanics.  Minus the UI, the production value, and a couple of buildings/progressions, it was almost different enough to be another RTS.  Some of the alterations were neat, others were bizarre.  If you play the Chinese faction during Skirmish mode, they can't build any common soldiers until they Age Up (upgrade the town hall), only siege units.  I'm sorry, what?  Whose brilliant idea was that?  You see, although there are many factions, there are really only four styles in the game:  European, Japanese, Chinese, and Indian.  It's not merely a difference in units, or buildings, but the fundamental mechanics of how they work.  Because I didn't spend a lot of hours in Skirmish mode, it's impossible for me to say if the game is balanced, but I doubt it.Something that appealed to me were the farming/shipment mechanics.  There's food, wood, coin, and a separate export resource if you're playing Asian Dynasties.  The way it's handled, however, you can build farms or receive shipments that are slow, infinite pools of any of those things.  If you run out of wild animals to hunt, build a farm or raise livestock.  If you run out of gold, plantations or rice paddies are infinite.   Wood is more difficult, but Asian Dynasties allows you to plant groves, or you can receive shipments in any case.  As a result, resource-management in the game is a lot less stressful than pretty much any RTS I've played.  Another thing that stood out is the ability to train stacks of five.  If you have the resources, you can train five troops in one building at once, and when it's finished five will pop out.  The need for multiple barracks is basically absent.  That's about everything that stood out for me.  I wouldn't pay 40 dollars for the game, wait for a decent sale, but it's definitely worth picking up for RTS fans if you don't mind historical backdrop.			"

I've been playing these games my whole life and now I just bought this 3-pack and I fell in love again. I recommend this game if you like strategic games and growing a colony to take over others. This game really gives your brain a tingle. You can play the campaign but I prefer the skirmish matches. Build your town center and start building Barracks, Stables, Farms, Armories etc. Build your army and crush your foes. (I enjoy building huge walls around my city!)			"

												One of the best RTS games created.Should you buy this, you will not be dissapointed with your purchase.Best feature for me? The Expansion Packs were actually expansions that changed the game in multiple ways and added on to the complete/full base form of the game. What I mean is, normally DLC nowadays is required to get the full package of what the final product should've been. AoE3's Expansion Packs ARE NOT DLC. The Expansion Packs in AoE3 add on to the game content enough to make it feel like a different game within a game. The Expansion Packs aren't neccessary to fully enjoy Age of Empires III; however, having them improves upon the player experience greater.			"

												This game is a classic RTS experience which can be enjoyed by anyone from a novice right up to strategic masters, I have been playing this game since release and was so impressed by the amount of times I have returned to this game after a few months break has made it worth every penny for a re-purchase on steam. If you enjoy games that envolve collecting resources and a large quantity of military and economic micromanagement then this game is for you!The multiplayer is what makes this game fantastic, the community are amazing and the battles even more impressive. The graphics even to this day are impressive so this is not a game to hold back on and is very well optimised for even the oldest and slowest of computers, if your looking for a game to keep dragging you back, this is the it!My only comments on improvement would be the reliability of the servers as of recent, there has been a few times I have failed to connect (I know they have maintenance on tuesdays, good to see they are still keeping the servers updated!), but with a good NAT type this shouldn't be an issue!My Rating - 8/10			"

												Great game but I can't play the DLCs? Dynastys and The War Chiefs??UPDATE: I know the solution, Dont start the game from the shortcut. You have to select the game at your steam game list and press Right mouse button on it. Then you see the 2 expansion, Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties. Good luck and have fun playing the game!			"

												This is my second time playing the base game and I still love it. The graphics are a bit old but the gameplay is as exceptional as it used to be years ago. Understandably a lot of people prefer the older games to this but I think AoE III has its fair share of pros. Enough to buy and play it, at least.Unfortunately there aren't many games being played on the online multiplayer mode. I guess it comes with the game being old.			"

												Great game! The improved graphics and gameplay are definitely a step up from the 2nd game in the AoE series. The ships are a lot more realistic in size, and your army sports some new equipment (namely, guns). The one thing that I don't like about this is the resources. For example, in AoE 2, you had to build a mill, and then build farms in order to gather food. You would also have to constantly resupply your farmland. In AoE 3, however, it's more of a one-time-deal; you build a mill, which comes with farmland included, and that's it. You don't have to resupply the mill with more wood to keep the farm going. You can just let it sit there for forever. Now while some people may like this, I personally, am not a huge fan of it as since it makes the game a bit TOO easy. Overall though, definitely still a good game and a worthy buy.			"

												As a proud AoE fanboy, I was delighted to learn a steam version had become available. AoE3 is something of a unique RTS game in that it is well balanced vanilla (prior to expansions) because of nearly a decade worth of patching. While the expansions fail to deliver as solid a RTS experience (and bump the faction count from 8 to 14), they aren't inherently bad either.I was pleased to learn also that my ESO log in and password still worked after all this time.

												Scarry how well this game has held up over time.  One of the best RTS that Microsoft ever put out.  It toes that fine line of not being too complex or too fast as most of these games fall into.  The allows you to set the pace and give your nation a life-like feel,    The UI is excellent and providing the information you need to keep up with your opponents while staying out of the way so you can see what your minions are up to.  I love that nations feel different, each having their own culture and quirks that gives this game a very Civilization feel.If you want to sink some time playing a game, there are few better than this.

												This review is part of the vow I made to play ALL my Steam games and make short reviews of them.Age of Empires II was among the first games I ever played, and possibly the first RTS I ever played (that, or Warcraft 2).When Age of Empires III was released, I wasn't very interested, mostly because I had been pulled away from the RTS genre and that scene for a couple of years.9 years after it's initial release, I decide to get this, and boy what a great purchase. This game summarizes what I love about RTS games. Age of Empires III feels so much like a polished and new Age of Empires II, which is exactly what it should be, and at times, it doesn't even feel like this game was released in 2005.This game does most things right, having some flaws in it's gameplay since it's so old and many new games have stepped in and added to the RTS genre. Take this out of concideration (because the game still doesn't feel out-dated to me), and you have one great RTS game well worth it's price even though it's old.			"

												I spent years playing Age of Empires 2 + Age of Kings expansion. Since I'm not much of a RTS fan, I never liked other strategy games much, but AoE 1&2 were a pleasure for me. When AoE3 first came out, I tried it, but didn't like it. It was annoying to young me, because I was used to AoE2-like gameplay, and the sudden change was something I hated in AoE3.Years have passed, and a friend talked me into buying AoE3. We started playing it together, and it changed my opinion completely. While he is a huuuuuge fan, I wouldn't call myself a fan, but I like the game very much. It's smooth, and has some interesting advantages compared to older AoE titles.Although I'm still not a good RTS player, and I still don't really like playing RTS games, AoE3 captured my time. When played with a friend, this game is a great co-op opportunity. A variety of races, all with their unique units and strategies, makes this game what it is: A classic.Although I loved the game, I must say that Age of Empires 3: Complete Collection is not worth buying at 37€. It's too expensive, and is old enough to fall below the 15€ mark. However, if you're like me, and like sales - buy the game when its price gets low enough for your expectations.My score: 7.3/10			"

												Though It seems very similar to the previous two titles, AoE3 has vastly superior graphics and a greater variety of unit types for each nation.  Combine this with several engaging single player campaigns and excellent multiplayer options to give you a solid strategy experience.			"

												Good and decent game.I grew up playing Age of Empires 2 and loved it.I saw Age of Empires on Steam and got the newest one because it may have many upgrades. It did have many upgrades (graphics and such), but the gameplay is really different. The gameplay is not bad either, though.However, if you grew up with AoE II and want to play it, get AoE II instead of AoE III. Really differet gameplays and feels.Overall, Age of Empires III is a good game. Not anything that I would call amazing or classic though,			"

												I bought this to play with my friends but we can't connect to a single game online. Neither LAN nor to any ESO servers. For 37 Euros I don't think it's actually worth it to go through trouble trying to connect online and end up lost in troubleshoots. Lucky for me that I spent a fifth of that price. I wish that it is able to be played online without errors and lots of problems between steam users.Overall I did play the campaigns and they are nice and have lots of work put into them so I would still recommend it if you're going to play this single player.

												An absolute classic. Although many wouldnt consider it as good as AoE II, I find the single player campaigns and improved graphics make it far more enjoyable these days. The Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties add well balanced playable factions as well as new campaigns. There arent many people still playing the multiplayer but if you can get this game on sale the single player and skirmish mode are well worth playing. The only drawback is the price tag, £30 for a ten year old game even with the two expansion packs isnt a great deal but this bundle can be acquired cheaply on sale or from other sites.			"

												I can Recommend this game !!!!! For me it's a 10/10, but when you go play this game there are from my point a few requirements. 1. The multiplayer mode sucks so you have to install gameranger to play online or with friends. 2. Friends also should buy this game, because playing alone is fun, but when you play with friends its 10 times better. 3. You should have a lot of free time. You can change the game speed, but when you turn it to fast it's really boring and unrealistic. If you play at normal speed its the best and that takes for a good game 1,5-2 hours. It brought back my youth ! You don't need a brain for this game it's very easy to play. This game is great. You should definility buy it ( [/b]if you have the 3 points I said[/b] ).			"

I don't play as much due the time needed ( I like long economic battles) and the lack of players at times. This game got me into gaming consistantly and PC gaming in general. If you like RTS games this is perfect for you. If you like FPS this is actually pretty fast paced. Easy game to learn, hard to master, still can't get the Germans and Russians to work.10/10, One of the greatest game ever produced. Wish the developers were still around.			"

												This is a VERY good game. If you want to play single player, PLEASE BUY IT and you won't be sorry. BUT.Online gaming and support are beyond terrible. You can't join 99% of the games, and even after spending hours and hours trying to fix the issues, nothing works. NO support from steam, NO support from microsoft, and NO (working) support from the forums. Treat this as a single player game because multiplayer is broken beyond repair.""Failed to join game"".

												8/10. It's really tactical, you usually don't just hop in and kill everybody, the physics are kinda funny. The campaign is good. Why 8/10 then? Well, if you put it on easy you don't even try. You WIN no matter WHAT. NO tactics, just start, quick colony then victory. This is why youu should NEVER press the sandbox difficulty and RARELY the easy one. Sorry if this is long, but at least I hope it is useful for you :)			"

												Old school realtime strategy with some pretty nice physics, building demolitions and ideas based on colonial powers. Story is trying to fill some historical gaps but is pretty simplistic and nothing to be really interested in. Playing as different civilizations and trying their unique strategies is something worth giving a shot. Especially after introducing Asian Dynasties expansion pack, Asian civilizations have some pretty interesting mechanics of building and combat.			"

												I like this game, because I've been playing this game since my childhood, and it is still one of my favorite games of all times. It has a good skrimish play for both causal and returing players, there's mutliplayer for experienced and pro players but also has lobbies for causals, and has a descent campagin. Which most games these don't have (First comment).			"

												This is a GREAT game. a little out dated graphically, and in some ways can become somewhat repetitive. but the gameplay itself delivers a well balanced tactical strategy, that changes with every new round. Factors such as locations of resources, natural land obstacles, the strengths and weaknesses of which team you play as, which team you are playing against, and timing of every move all come in to play. If you are looking for a graphically superior game, this is not for you, but if you are looking for a well balanced game that tests your wit on decision making and productivity, this is for you!			"

Well, if you put it on easy you don't even try. You WIN no matter WHAT. NO tactics, just start, quick colony then victory. This is why youu should NEVER press the sandbox difficulty and RARELY the easy one. Sorry if this is long, but at least I hope it is useful for you :)			"

												One of my most played favorites, goes in the hall of fame. Easy to master, lovely and balanced. Virtually zero learning curve, and the UI is a joy.The game does a lot of the work for you, while you consider small strategies. But a child can do the same.It feels complete and polished, but lacks depth and becomes extremely repetitive, however i seemed to overlook the repetition very easily.The is a large veriety of units and enough customizability to have an unspeakable number of permutations of a player's deck build, and the player can easily emboss their own personality into their army and city arrangement.You can be in any state of mind and enjoy this game, as it is relaxing and stimulating without being mentally over-taxing.

												An amazing sequel! Better graphics, better game play better everything! Age of Empires 3, has a very fun levelling system which each level you gain special cards that will give you perks for your colony. These can be customised into the players own 'deck' which then can be used while in game on multiplayer or skirmish, and it’s amazing. This immersive system really brings the thrill of a well planned strategic battle, keeping you hooked for hours. Although the multiplayer setting is extremely harsh on new players, you may have to spend half your time trying to find a lobby that will allow you to join; once you've reached a reasonable level, the game is at its peak. 10/10			"

												I know many who love the original Age of Empires games (especially #2) hate this game or mock it for not being like the others. I grew up on Age of Empires 2 and it remains to be one of my favourite games of all time. Unlike the others I love this game as much, maybe even more, for fixing the small issues in the other games and generally making a more polished product.  The campaigns are more exciting and the combat more visceral. The expansions add many new civilizations with a whole new set of playstyles the likes of which the franchise hasn't seen before! The point of this short review is to convince people that the naysayers are wrong and that this product is the perfect swan song for Ensemble Studios.			"

In addition to game development, Ensemble Studios also made the Genie Game Engine used in Age of Empires, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, and Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds.

												If you're planning to play this solely for the single player then get this game on sale. If you're getting this for the multiplayer...eh. I wouldn't recommend this game for multiplayer because not only I forgot my login account (which is very stupid btw imo to have an account when AOE2 didn't), but I keep getting ""Failed to join game"" message. I'm from the US and was able to play with my European friend once before, but after that I can't play multiplayer with him ever again.			"

												What can I say? Its AoE!!! Epic game :)I really like the nostalgie you get when playing AoE 3, this one is def. my favorite, i love that you can manage your city and build it up from start to something amazing, with the cards u unlock for the deck and stuff! I love it!It brings back memories from back in the good old days with AoE (normal) and AoE 1Thanks summer deals for a great buy! hahaBut.. I did wish there would be achievements for this, in AoE 2 there are some (a lot) but none in AoE 3 which kinda disapointed me but didnt stop me from playing thoughtThis game has lots of things going on to make cool achievements from. But that is just my opinion here :PAlso, a couple more abilities for your city would be nice too, maybe as an extentional DLC?I am not sure if this is a bug, but when i try take defend towers in my game, it gives me barracks instead, I would like to know how i can fix this because i can already buy barrack by default, so its givin me something totally useless and it says it can be used for barracks or defend towers yet i only see the barracks option when i try to build them. (its unlocked via cards in the deck)..Further as that i have no complains and i do enjoy this game a lot and i will play it more often againMuch more i cant say, its a great game if u love strategy..Thanks for making this awesome game :-)			"

												The game is alright, but forget going online with it. Multiple people seem to have been issued the same key, I had it tell m,e a spanish person used my key online and I don't even know anyone in spain. Ui is bigger than AoE2 almost to the point of intrusive and wasting space. You can rush people even easier now, which makes it less a strategy game and more of a race to see who has best early game. I mean, getting an army now in less than 5 minutes is a requirement for survival outside of the scenerios and campaigns they, the game makers, give you. >_>			"

												If you have never played a RTS before in your life, this is the GO-TO Holy Grail of all real time stradegy games in existence. Best to catch this game when its on sale, because the 40$ seems a bit pricey for an older game. I have 1000+ hours on the game on my disk version of the game and I would have to say I have played this game more than any other game I have played. The Multiplayer is dismal due to low population on the online server, but is a perfect platform for some co-op fun vs AI. One thing that sets this game apart from the other AoE, AoM and RoN is RPG elements built in to your home city to provide a personalized way of play.			"

												While somewhat weaker than its predecessors, this one still holds up the AoE experience.> The campaigns are fun enough, though not that interesting. The exception being the Asian Dynasties which I enjoyed a lot more.> There is life in the multiplayer, though there is a progression system involved that is quite annoying if you just start up.Launch the game as Asian Dynasties!!!All other content is included and the game is vastly improved with more options, better UI and full unit stats available in game with no extra clicks. I don't know why that was ommited in the first 2 itterations.			"

												I have played this game for at least five years and only recently have I found out that they sell it on steam. This is the best strategy game out there. It even beats Candy Crush. Just being able to work with an actual intelligent AI team is such a great feeling. 10/10 Hobo Harry's			"

												One of the best  RTS games out there. I don't care how old this game is. It's still better than many new strategies. it's a  MUST BUY if you like strategy games. Also get the DLC since they add lot's of cool stuff in game. "

												If you have never played a RTS before in your life, this is the GO-TO Holy Grail of all real time stradegy games in existence. Best to catch this game when its on sale, because the 40$ seems a bit pricey for an older game. I have 1000+ hours on the game on my disk version of the game and I would have to say I have played this game more than any other game I have played. The Multiplayer is dismal due to low population on the online server, but is a perfect platform for some co-op fun vs AI. One thing that sets this game apart from the other AoE, AoM and RoN is RPG elements built in to your home city to provide a personalized way of play.			"

												While somewhat weaker than its predecessors, this one still holds up the AoE experience.> The campaigns are fun enough, though not that interesting. The exception being the Asian Dynasties which I enjoyed a lot more.> There is life in the multiplayer, though there is a progression system involved that is quite annoying if you just start up.Launch the game as Asian Dynasties!!!All other content is included and the game is vastly improved with more options, better UI and full unit stats available in game with no extra clicks. I don't know why that was ommited in the first 2 itterations.			"

Age of Awesome!Back in the day when this game was originally released it was often compared to the civilization series of games.In keeping with that, this is a game that has stood the test of time.So much so infact that we are what? 10 years since it's original release and the game still holds up!The multiplayer netcode is amazing, the gameplay is deep and fun and the graphics still hold up well today.The team behind this game would later go on to make the 'Orcs Must Die' series of games which are also fantastic games as well.The main goal of AoE3 is to crush all those who oppose you. Typically stragedy game stuff, but what makes the AoE series unique is that you go through 'Eras' similar to the Civ series of games however unlike those games this all happens in real time and acts as a barometer as to how deep in the (military) tech tree you are. There is a lot about this game to talk about and I can't do this game justice; The home city customization, the deck tweaking to fashion future battles to your tactics, unit formations you can switch on the fly, the explorer unit that can't die, allying with neutral locals ala city states in Civ5, years before Civ5 was even created! To Stand the Test of TimeThere are too many things about this game to like infact that is how it was designed. Greg ""Ghostcrawler"" Street, formally of Blizzard Entertainment said: ""We worried a lot about how to innovate while staying true to the heart of the Age series. Many of the earlier features we tried were pretty different, but frankly a lot of them weren’t all that fun either. When we had iterated on an idea for too long and weren’t getting anywhere, we usually went back to what worked in our previous games. We knew our iterative design process makes great games.""And what a great game it is. Even after all this time you can boot it up and have a blast playing it. Speaking of blasts, despite being a war game, it has real time physics and ragdolls so when you shoot someone with a cannon they actually and believably go flying! Your mortor shots on buildings leave entry and exits holes in buildings, you really feel like there is weight behind your unit attacks and that is very awesome. Infact the whole game, is awesome!Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												Sadly, something about the combination of Steam, AOE III and Windows 10 x64 appears to be broken.  While I can get the two expansions to work (after being forced to enter the admin password!), the base game crashes during startup with ye olde ""This program failed to start..."".  The only way I managed to get the base game running is when logged in with my admin account, not something I want to do ongoing.  I've tried explicitly setting file permissions in the Steam games folder to give my normal user account full control but that didn't seem to change anything.  Also ran the usual verification process and it always reports one file failed to verify but never seems to resolve this.  Steam support pages indicate this message may be normal...Disappointed because AOE II HD edition works fine so thought AOE III would too.  Will most likely seek a refund if I can't locate a solution today.			"

												I practically lived on RTS games for nearly a decade , and this was one of them , back when hi def was 800x600.This game didnt dissapoint , rather its like seeing the girl from school you fancied 20 years later , and realised you dont want something rekindled and realised you have moved on.FPS games , rpgfps , replaced those strategy games I once loved , just like that schoolcrush , the love for the old diminished on the realisation that the good old days have their place , in the past.IT is still as good as the orginal , if you get it on a silly offer its worth it , but as an intro to the younger player that never grew up on a diet of computer mags , bbs was the only internet , and windows was installed from a floppy , then I doubt it fairs well with any of their reviews.

												Good Game Rubric, but also hints of historical features which make everyone happy. Fun early, midgame and lategame competition, as well as plenty of replay value. I develop a Fan Patch for this game, N3O FP1.3z3N, which is available at aoe3.heavengames.comIncludes new maps, balance, spice, new unique features, without changing the way the game is played!Has been tested by some of the best players in the community, and aims to achieve the highest regard. Developed over 2 1/2 years, it should give every player a new feel, just like when Warchiefs expansion came out. It is large enough to be considered an Expansion Pack by itself, except that it comes free of charge!On top of this, it includes a deadly new AI, highly skilled in 2v2 matches. If you are a fan of the Age Series, Buying Age of Empires III this is a must. If you are further very adament about this game, I would highly suggest trying out the Fan Patch. If not the Patch, then for its AI player! regards,murdilator			"

												Extremely frustrated with this mess of a game, had to register externally from steam to play even though I downloaded through the steam client (no other game has made me do that unless I had bought it elswhere)and surprisingly I was able to play for an entire 2 hours straight no issues at all, no frame rate drop or glitching.After that 2 hours of play I closed the game (foolishly it would seem) and since then it has crashed every single time I try to start up, even dropped the graphics settings to minimun thinking that was the issue but no it was not. I went ahead and used the check files option in the advanced settings to see if something had corrupted, no luck everything was apparently fine.So now i have to delete my local content and go through another 13gb download if i wish to continue playing this game.The actual gameplay is quite polished and satisfying to play, yet with an issue like this I can't give it anything else except for a thumbs down.

												Offers a slightly different play-style than in Age of Empires II. One of the biggest changes to the game is the resources and resource-gathering process. There are only three resources instead of four.  Your resource-gathering does not have to be micro-ed as much as in previous games because in the later ages, food and gold do not run out. Wood can also be continuously generated through factories, shrines, trading-posts, etc. This allows the player to focus more on their military. The nearly-unlimited supply of resources means that later battles do not turn into ""trash-fights"" induced by the lack of gold/wood. Overall, a very good game but overpriced without any discounts. Wait for a sale.			"

												You guys have got to get this! Its friggin amazing! The multiplayer has brilliant progression system. (selecting special abilities from a deck of unlocked cards to personalise your play style.) The building in this is quite unique in that you can place your structures anywhere, there is no 'grid' placement. The destruction is entirely satisfying; watching cannons blow appart a building and the peices cascade over the landscape BLEW MY MIND! No more generic, repeated destruction animation! The customisation of your home city was an a great surprise! A fantastic reward for leveling up and a great backdrop for the menu screens. Additionally I dont really mind the fewer races, as there are so many units in each. What I would have liked to see is the unit formations buttons from age of empires II, allowing you to alter the positions of your army better. Additionally the stance buttons to prevent your army running off would be great to implement. 4.2 out of 5, im addicted already!			"

If you like starcraft this is pretty much it with nations from the british to russian, not only that but the complete collection adds asian nations such as japan, china, and india plus the indian tribes like cherokee and iriquoi (excuse my spelling) which makes this game great. Also adds mods such as risk and colloseum which is a mass army no population limit mod. no downloading needed for the mods but it is a little costly out of a 5 i would put a 4 mostly because of its price			"

												First off, this game is NOT as good as AOE2! this is pretty weak in comparrison, but it is MOSTLY a AOE game.......i say mostly because the civilisations don't feel that unique anymore, theres no real benefit to play as england against spain, for example. and the city idea just proves that. the graphics are pretty nice, which makes this game a bit more enjoyable. The story mode is pretty short and very.........slow and weak. i wanted it like in AOE2, where you could play as several people in history, like El Cid.  I'd say avoid this UNLESS you never played AOE before, as it is a decent introduction. THEN get AOE2			"

												This game is one of my favorites and a great game. If you like starcraft this is pretty much it with nations from the british to russian, not only that but the complete collection adds asian nations such as japan, china, and india plus the indian tribes like cherokee and iriquoi (excuse my spelling) which makes this game great. Also adds mods such as risk and colloseum which is a mass army no population limit mod. no downloading needed for the mods but it is a little costly out of a 5 i would put a 4 mostly because of its price			"

												Really fun RTS, one of the best RTS because you can feel so at peace with your town and your people even though all the players on the map are out to get you and run by your base every 10 minutes, scouting it out. It's one of the best RTS I've played, only reason I don't have more playtime is because I barely play RTS and when I do, I play Dawn of War.I recommend it to anyone who likes RTS even the slightest, and all the other AoEs aswell.

												Age of Empires III is, without a doubt, an RTS classic. Though perhaps not as popular or widely played as its predecessor, AoE3 deserves recognition for its gutsiness and charm.Gameplay is comparable to other RTS titles with the notable exception of the home city and experience mechanics. Prolonged games and even campaigns will accrue experience points that grant resource, tech, and military benefits to players based on their customized home cities. The ability to level up one's supply support and farm experience through side objectives and battles adds an entirely new dimension to the economic and military struggles that have typically comprised RTS experiences.Aesthetically, the game is quite enjoyable. While it is a tad old, the textures and visual resources manage to be reasonable (though cutscenes are frequently laughable in quality). The ability to zoom in and out on the game has made a return from Age of Mythology, making combat engagements easier to watch and enjoy up close. The soundtrack is iconic and will get stuck in your head after only a few games.The campaigns are what make the complete collection really shine. While deathmatches and skirmishes are entertaining, the at-times-poorly-written-but-still-enjoyable story of the Black family over six generations establishes a sort of epic within the game that players will find themselves driven to progress through. Lovable and hateable characters such as the black family, Billy Holme, Kanyenke, Major Cooper, and more color the games often cheesy but still fantastic story. The relative historical accuracy of the game makes is engaging and watching characters such as George Washington, Simon Bolivar, and General Custer being woven into the story is quite amusing. An expectation emerges as to who the story will involve next. Once players get bored with the stories of the Black family (in the original game and the War Chiefs expansion), they can turn their eyes to several shorter stories of Japanese, Chinese, and Indian heroes in the Asian Dynasties expansion, allowing for a whole new Age of Empires experience.Most faults within the game are fairly minor and don't impede playing extensively. The most irritating problem comes with managing large groups of units and selecting individual soldiers out of said groups. This can be accomplished much easier with hotkeys, but it's a lot of effort for such an activity. Unit speeds, managing artillery, and certain little ticks with targeting, action queueing, and attack orders are also frustrating at times, though not game breaking. The pacing of the Japanese campaign in the Asian Dynasties expansion is also notably broken, although it arguably allows for a wider range of deck and home city customisation.Age of Empires III is, in brief, yet another respectable and pleasant RTS game from Ensemble Studios. The gameplay echoes older titles while incorporating novel elements to breath new life into the series, and the story is engrossing and captivating in much the same way that Age of Mythology (and, to an extent, not Age of Empires II) was. AoE3's knack for good storytelling and gameplay that is quick and easy to pick up overcomes its small mechanical faults and sometimes poor campaign pacing to present an enchanting and memorable game that is definitely worth playing, and the variety of campaigns provided by the various expansions will ensure the player does just that for a considerable amount of time. Welcome to the New (or perhaps the old, as is the case with Morgan Black and the Japanese campaign) World!			"

												I've had this game and previous titles in the series since the discovery age (pun intended) but was unable to play multiplayer until i purchased it on steam, the multiplayer is so much more in depth and unexpected than single player. The only 2 things that annoy me and they REALLY annoy me is that, It takes a very long time to find opponents using ""quick"" search which i guess can be explained by the small playerbase, and in game browser you will always end up with at least 1 pro on your team or the enmy which will single handedly win the game for that team, even if you change the title of the lobby to something like ""noobs only"" some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will still join. The other annoyance is that if one person is lagging either due to low FPS or bad internet all players will lag to the same extent or even more, which is very frustrating to experience with a high end system and good internet.Overall  I would recommend if you have played the singleplayer enough and want to play multiplayer, and think you are good enough to not be smashed by the pros, i would not buy for the singleplayer aspect though as the campaign is quick and the skirmish with bots get's repetitive fairly quickly.

OverallThis game is honestly one the best, no... I'm sorry, THE BEST RTS game I have ever played. I liked this better than other games like dota and smite (though I am more of a historical strategy nerd) but I think that the mechanics of building buildings and being able to control of all of your units amazing. I would say that this game is a little overpriced, and that's why I got it during a sale.DLCI like the complete edition because playing as the native americans or the asians is very different from the way that you play the Europeans, yet I feel that each country is still pretty balanced. The campaign is actually very fun to play, too.Age of Empires III versus Age of Empires II Now, if you are trying to decide between AoE II or AoE III, I would recommended this game (AoE III) only if you haven't played AoE II before. I've heard that this game is different from AoE II in ways that the people who play AoE II don't like, but if you have never been exposed to AoE II before you will find that the pros outweigh the cons of playing this game because most people who like AoE II mostly like it out of nostalgia.ConclusionIn the end, this game and Civilization V are the only games I play frequently on Steam. So, if you enjoy strategy games of historical themes, get this one of you like RTS or get Civilization V if you like turn-based games.P.S. As for you AoE II fans, well just get AoE II because AoE III tends to disappoint the lot of you. "

												A really solid RTS game.... I was happy to see that they chose this particular time frame (Napoleonic Era).... It's a nice relief to all the sci-fi, WWII, modern day and ancient era RTS games.... The Graphics are particularly well done and obviously smarter AI compared to Age of Mythology and Age of Empires II... The War Chiefs and Asian Dynasty are also very good expansion packs and I suggest if you purchase this game...get the expansion packs with it.... I give this game 8.5/10 it loses a point because unless you are interested in this era, this game can get boring really quickly.... I've played this game long before I got Steam so that would explain the low amount of hours!!			"

												I have been a fan of Age of Empires since it first came out. I have two accounts and I will pay for the game again if I had to. This is probably the best game ever made (not many people play it) but it is sure entertaining and never gets old. You can be playing for hours in one single game and have fun. I had multiple nights playing 4-5hrs in one single game is insane. If your thinking of getting this game..trust me is worth it. It takes some time to get used to but the community will help you along the way. Can you imagine playing 8 players in a map and all of them are real players? My stats show about 3500+ games played now that tells you something. Since it came to steam I am more excited as more new players will play. This game is now considered ""old"" but trust me the graphics are good for this day in age.Writing this much about a game can tell you something. Trust me...BUY IT!:::Best LOST player:::			"

												I'm really only posting this to encourage others to buy AOE3 > AOE2. AOE3 has better graphics and the gameplay feels more streamlined like other modern RTS. There are distinct build orders and you'll feel satisified completing a fish boom trurtle against a rush player, and on the other hand cavalary rushes will feel different than inifantry rushes so there is a lot of replayability regardless of play style.The overall game is similar to older AOE installments with a Rock Paper Scissor style of unit balance. The same type of units are shared across multiple civilations so its easy to understand what units you'll need to overcome your opponets army. The resorce collection is more invovled and extremely engaging compared to other RTS. Resource collection is simplified from AOE2 but still demands that players understand map control to secure future resources for continued military production. I can't compliment the resource gathering system in AOE enough its the main reason I feel this game has stood the test of time.Trading posts and deck building add dynamic map centric objectives, there is a lot of negativity around the card system and yes its true most players will use the same cards for the first 1-3 shipments, in late game they provide diversity and allow you to specialize into specific tech choices. If you're coming back to Age of Empires from Starcraft or another modern RTS than AOE3 will have the best feel for you. 10-20minute games compared to 40-60minute games in AOE2. The gameplay is more streamlined and build orders are unique and rewarding. And if you're the player that enjoys long turtle games they are still 100% possible and as I stated feel more rewarding when defending challenging pushes from your opponet.Happy Hunting.			"

												Love the game, but I lost my ESO account login password. And when I try to retrieve the password on the AOE website I need my prodcut-ID.. And steam gives me 1 product-ID per game.. so that's 3. And all 3 don't match my CD-key.. So I can't retrieve my password. Now I can't play the game online anymore.. And i've contacted steam support. And they keep sending me to the ESO forum and they let me e-mail ESO. But ESO doesn't respond.Nice going steam. selling me a product that doesn't work properly. you could just as well sell me a car, and when I get into a crash the car has no airbags. (And no i can't make a new ESO account, because AOE says: 1 ESO account per cd-key)I would recommend the game, it's awesome, but Steam needs to sell you a properly working product.			"

												AoE 3 with its addons is a fine little edition created by ensemble.im not one for writing long as hell reviews so ill keep it simple and informative.Pros:- Stays faithful to AoE mechincs- Interesting way to customise your chosen nation in mp/skirmish with cards- Interesting stories in the numerous campaigns- looks pretty- cheesy but funny in game voice overs of leadersCons :- I felt the maps were small- Combat can be rather onesided for or against you depending on tech- Cant build a wall over trade router but you can in tutorial (dafuq?)- AI can be turtle like or rush like theres no real balance or intelligence to it- Multiplayer is deadOverall:Id say buy it if you a fan of the other AoE titles. If youve never played AoE before then again buy it it will give you something new to try. Being an age old AoE fan my oppinion is biased but i do like and i would reccomend it for those who like RTS and looking for something different to play7/10			"

												I wanted to like this game. However, Age of Empires® III: Complete Collection is a game that simply doesn't meet what I remember as a child and the awesome gameplay that I used to have to load from a disc (and still do own). As nice as the visuals in this game are, the gameplay simply is sub-par and I was bored very quickly into it, unlike the fast-paced action of the original game. In addition, Decks feel like a clunky and unnecessary addition to the game. The benefits they provide are not neglectible, so you can't enjoy the game as is; you have to play with decks in order to not be left behind, which is something I find unnecessary and tedious as an old player of the game.This game is not worth it. Simply put, Age of Empires II is a better game, and for good reason. It is the same price as this one. Once I get the money, I will be purchasing AoE II: HD Edition with all of its DLCs, which is ultimately the same price as this. So go buy AoE II: HD Edition, not this game. Unless you really like the deck building, or a slightly more relaxed gameplay, this version is not for you. As an RTS, this game is not bad, but as an Age of Empires game, I would take my money elsewhere.			"

Each campgain comes with 3 acts which should (depending on your difficulty) take you maybe 5-6 hours to finish. Plus, you have the online part which should add some extra hours of gameplay.

The online multiplayer is still enjoyable till this day, With an overall good community and hours of intense battles among many.+Good graphics for its time+Overall good AI+Soundtrack is nice+Many Civilizations to choose from with each their own advantages+Easy to learn controls-A few bugs that can be annoying but not drastic			"

OverallThis game is honestly one the best, no... I'm sorry, THE BEST RTS game I have ever played. I liked this better than other games like dota and smite (though I am more of a historical strategy nerd) but I think that the mechanics of building buildings and being able to control of all of your units amazing. I would say that this game is a little overpriced, and that's why I got it during a sale.DLCI like the complete edition because playing as the native americans or the asians is very different from the way that you play the Europeans, yet I feel that each country is still pretty balanced. The campaign is actually very fun to play, too.Age of Empires III versus Age of Empires II Now, if you are trying to decide between AoE II or AoE III, I would recommended this game (AoE III) only if you haven't played AoE II before. I've heard that this game is different from AoE II in ways that the people who play AoE II don't like, but if you have never been exposed to AoE II before you will find that the pros outweigh the cons of playing this game because most people who like AoE II mostly like it out of nostalgia.ConclusionIn the end, this game and Civilization V are the only games I play frequently on Steam. So, if you enjoy strategy games of historical themes, get this one of you like RTS or get Civilization V if you like turn-based games.P.S. As for you AoE II fans, well just get AoE II because AoE III tends to disappoint the lot of you. "

												Love the game, but I lost my ESO account login password. And when I try to retrieve the password on the AOE website I need my prodcut-ID.. And steam gives me 1 product-ID per game.. so that's 3. And all 3 don't match my CD-key.. So I can't retrieve my password. Now I can't play the game online anymore.. And i've contacted steam support. And they keep sending me to the ESO forum and they let me e-mail ESO. But ESO doesn't respond.Nice going steam. selling me a product that doesn't work properly. you could just as well sell me a car, and when I get into a crash the car has no airbags. (And no i can't make a new ESO account, because AOE says: 1 ESO account per cd-key)I would recommend the game, it's awesome, but Steam needs to sell you a properly working product.			"

												Got this game for £2.50 on humble bundle. I do miss the really nice cut scenes from AOE II though... But the game is suprisingly addictive. I also like how they added shipments, and the fact of being able to customize your home city.If you like building an empire, going to war and a non-turn based game, this is THE game for you. "

Each campgain comes with 3 acts which should (depending on your difficulty) take you maybe 5-6 hours to finish. Plus, you have the online part which should add some extra hours of gameplay. I sugggest you get this game.			"

												medieval strategic game and quite fun, creativity, and play for hours if he's running the shıt in that game too if you take, then you can go off and get bored of the game, but eventually you can do on a whim one day and play open and how much if you develop yourself, the better you will play and increasing the level of age of empire game is another classic game I'd say guys I might call the 2 DLC's when you receive that comes from the game itself, nothing i have to say about.

												AMAZING GAME!! I advanced every faction to level 40 back when I used to play it with the Warchiefs expansion on cd. The Asian Dynasties is a fantastic expansion alowing you to start a city at level 10 and play as the economically superior Indian faction, the versatile Chinese, and expensive but powerful Japanese.

												To me its theme is not as fun as Age of Mythology (I like fantasy better than westerns) but came later so you can expect better graphics. It is an old style rts with an easy campain; though it is long enough with the add-ons from the complete collection. The nice touch here is the home city you can level over the game (it will take many games to get all the upgrades for a single nations) and the variety of civilisations available in the complete collection.Definitely a good game to play if it goes on sale and you want to try a game in the Age Of series (this was the last release). If you like fantasy better and don't mind older graphics go for Age of Mythology insead. Though you may find better / nicer looking games			"

												The best of the AOE games, a solid and strong RTS, one of my favourites. With many factions to choose from, each unique in their own way. The Steam version also includes the 2 expansions which all 3 expansions factions can be played at the same time, unlike the disk versions where you can only play 1 expansion at a time. Strongly recommended for the RTS fan or someone who likes to control armies and dominate the battlefield, whether it be land or sea.			"

Personally, this game remembers me of the good old times and makes me feel very nostalgic. I totally recommend the whole AoE bundle.			"

												Build a colony, Recruit some troops, Build boats, Put troops on boats, Send boats to other island, Then completely blast up the Spanish and send them back to where they belong, in Spain. But in all seriousness this game is great and I've played it for years, and I'll probably play it for many years to come, I give it a 10/10 because I love sending the Spanish back to Spain.			"

												Good game, AI is kinda trash though but it's still pretty fun to play against and you can always play multiplayer as there are still people playing. ""Scenario editor"", used to make maps, is pretty cool and fun to mess around with. I recommend buying this when it is on sale, I got it for about $10 which is ~75% cheaper than the normal price.

												AoE 3 with its addons is a fine little edition created by ensemble.im not one for writing long as hell reviews so ill keep it simple and informative.Pros:- Stays faithful to AoE mechincs- Interesting way to customise your chosen nation in mp/skirmish with cards- Interesting stories in the numerous campaigns- looks pretty- cheesy but funny in game voice overs of leadersCons :- I felt the maps were small- Combat can be rather onesided for or against you depending on tech- Cant build a wall over trade router but you can in tutorial (dafuq?)- AI can be turtle like or rush like theres no real balance or intelligence to it- Multiplayer is deadOverall:Id say buy it if you a fan of the other AoE titles. If youve never played AoE before then again buy it it will give you something new to try. Being an age old AoE fan my oppinion is biased but i do like and i would reccomend it for those who like RTS and looking for something different to play7/10			"

 Have been a massive fan of age of empires all my life and brought this game as soon as it was realeased. I have played thousands of hours on the disk version of this game. I brought it on steam to purchase the DLCs and experience them. They are just as good as the base game; but i always go back to my personal favourite: the french! Putting that aside Age of Empires III ensures that the Age of Empires is one of the best RTS series' on the market. The new card and shipment system has brought in an extra level of strategy. The cards can be instrumental between a massive victory and a crushing victory, and i have often been involved in battles decided by who has the better cards. They can be the decider in who rushes the quickest, or who has the strongest military, or assist in establishing a stable econonomy with resource cards. Trade routes and native training buildings also bring in more strategy, with the ability to train cheap, effective native troops who have no impact on your population (but still have a build limit). Trade routes pretty much replace and improve on relics and allow you to collect more than just gold from them and can be a good resource provider.Units have been improved from 2 and nearly every unit has a strength against another type of unit, but for every strong unit, there is always a counter of some sorts. Although unique units from castles has been removed, you will find that in the base game, some civilisations will have access to some units while not having access to others.Artillery has been improved (organers from AOEII would destroy every unit in a battle, friend or foe alike) and the artillery can play a much bigger role in deciding the outcome of a battle.Ship Combat has also been refined and has become more fun to engage in, with access to ships that can train units, and having more than one ranged DPS ship designed specifically to destroy other enemy ships from a distance.Overall, Age of Empires III is a great game and is my personal favourite out of the series. I would recconmend it to new players and veterans of the genre who have played the first 2 and are looking for something new. Although be warned, stratetgy masters from the first 2 games will also have to learn the new mechanics; you cannot just pick up where you left off in AOEII and think you'll be just as good in AOEIII, and vice versa. It will feel alot different when you go back and play the first 2 games. But enough rambling on, i greatly recconmend this game to anyone 8.5/10  "

												Age of Empires III is more than just a game, it's the latest generation in a legacy of great games. It is the exampe of what games should be like in this genre. It still sets the bar for excellence. I come back to in continually to pop on and do part of a campaign or a quick squirmish. The online multiplayer is a bit lacking, but it appears they are working on new servers for it. Mainly there arent many people playing it, and it can be difficult to connect. Hopefully they will continue to develop and work on this great name for some time (and one day we'll see the much anticipated Age of Empires IV). This is a must buy. I've played every type of game there is to play for a couple of decades now. Just like Link to the Past and MGS, you will return to this game to remind yourself of what you love about it.			"

												Age of Empires III is less of a successor and more of a reimagining of Age of Empires II. Limited, level-based, and less challenging than AoE2, it's not easy to fairly compare the two games. It feels like the AoE3 developers never really played AoE2 much, but were fond of playing the Warcraft series and based it off of that. In every game you get an ""Explorer"" which isn't much more than a glorified villager that never permanently dies. Your choices for game setup are 1-vs-1 team or a free-for-all. There are no in-game alliances, all your units and buildings are limited in number, and your max pop is about 200. Oh, and your home city can only earn 30,000 xp each game.Despite these limitations, resources (Wood, Food, Gold; stone is nonexistant) couldn't be easier to gather. Buildings such as Farms, Rice Paddies, etc. offer unlimited free resources after building for one low cost.The goal of this game is to level up your home city and earn ""cards"", shipments you recieve at no cost from your home city. You try each civilization out, level them up, and if you don't have a fiance, friends, or a family member to play with, you never play this again for a very long time.If you like Age of Empires II, DON'T buy this game unless it's dirt cheap. You will try it, play it, tire of it, and return to Age of Empires II.5.5/10			"

Posted: April 26, 2016
												I haven't had much call to write negative reviews thus far - I habitually only choose to say stuff about things I like, which would make my mum proud I guess - but duty compells me to speak out against Age of Empires III, and sundry, on account of the hideous let down it proved to be with regards to the duty of all sequels to take the best parts of earlier titles in a series and strive to improve them further.Age of Empires is one of the few series in which I can honestly claim to have a comprehensive base of experience in on which to form opinions (TES, Deus Ex, Civilization and MGS spring to mind as other examples), in fact I don't think there is any game series which I have a more complete relationship to than this one. (I might say Vanilla WoW had the biggest impact on me, for better or worse, but that's not a series is it)So this might be a bit rant'y. But I will try to also make it instructive.This game is a massive betrayal and letting down of everything that made the opening two titles of the series, and their expansions, so fantastic.Starting at the beginning: Age of Empires. Released in, I believe, 1998, this was one of the first full computer games that I ever attempted to play, since my family got it as part of a deal for a new PC, our first modern computing system. I wouldn't say that I played it, per se. I was a bit of a dumbass then and it took me a few months at least to realize that the trial version game I had been playing over and over again actually existed on the same computer in full version, if only I would insert the play CD located near the computer. The trial version however informed my relationship with Age of Empires, and informed what I came to really expect from Age of Empires: The mini-campaign we enjoyed (indeed, I believe it was a single mission - practically at least this is what it was because as a total nubcake I believe I never actually beat the mission, though I got extremely good at playing it) traced the birth of the Hittite culture, from gathering food from a carcass or two to entering the Bronze Age and raiding one - perhaps two? Broad Swordsmen to take the fight to our dastardly red foes.The game was about history, it was informative, the graphics were detailed, the music lovely, the missions loooong and the scope for imagination limitless.Then of course we all know what happened when Age of Empires II came out. I first caught wind of AoE2 when I was outside a PC shop in a shopping centre food court and I saw some lucky so-and-so playing the Joan of Arc campaign opening mission inside the window. As someone who had loved Age of Empires for so long (a couple of years at least) this game represented a quantum leap in graphics, detail, narrative, storytelling, scripting - everything! It blew my mind.But it was still about history. It was still informative - even more so - the graphics were so detailed that even now 16 years later they are still gorgeous to me, the music was even more lovely and the missions seemed bigger, longer, but also more accessible.Age of Empires II: The Conquorers Expansion was the final shining badge of honour on the series, the ultimate RTS game. Adding a few tweaks to the fantastic Age of Empires II model - one click garrissoning, farm build queus - everything went into overdrive with the addition of the Aztecs and some other South American civilzations, as well as the introduction 'closer to home' as it were of such slightly less antiquated groups such as the Spanish or Koreans. The Hun campaign, following Atilla, would prove to be the most immersive and replayable of all the narrative-driven campaigns, supplanting Joan of Arc and Ghengis Khan from the base game.So finally we get to what happened when Age of Empires III came out.Well, initially it looked like another fantastic rebirth of this timeless, epic series. I deduced this from a raft of gorgeous screenshots - never before or since has a historic setting been so beautifully presented. Turtled sunned themselves on logs, Native Americans rode dustily across a distant plane, Mayan temples towered above misty swamps. These screenshots can all still eb found online if one looks hard enough through the google image results. It was inevitable, I thought, a done deal: Age of Empires III was going to be the most beautiful, expansive, historically absorbing, atmospheric RTS game ever created. I was so proud of my series.So what did I get instead? Well to prevent you from feeding money to this pile of excrement I will spoil it for you (at least partially).The long missions and giant maps have been replaced by crap maps with ridiculous scaling and a totally inadequate zoom range, as well as the addition of a ton of third-party NPC settlements and the like designed to aid the flow of quick gameplay. The graphics that looked so unbelievable - like Crysis made into an RTS - in early screenshots lost entire fields of polygons, lost textural acuity by the boatload, giving us something that looked like a cross between Age of Mythology and freaking Warrior Kings. The gameplay, which had looked pacific, ephemeral and deliberate in the screenshots turned into a pile off bullspit, with hero characters and wonky missions structures completely doing away with micromanagement or preparations. Your villages didn't even walk anymore, you just sent them to gathering places and they just stood there feeding you resources. What the hell does this even MEAN?But the biggest sin of all is what they did to the historical roots of the series: They took a pewp all over them. You wanted to relive the conquests and dying resistance of the Aztecs in beautiful, out of this world graphics and scale? Too bad. You get some coque and bull story about frigging jesuit knights searching for the fountain of youth. This spoiler is but a taste of the range and depth of the ridiculous plots that we get shoved down our throats by this ridiculous title, which ends up having our chief enemy during our South American adventure being the trucking Ottoman Empire.Don't even get me started on the massive gimmick and gameplay-hastener that is the home city concept.No. Don't get this game. Get the AoE2 HD bundle available elsewhere on Steam. This game is god awful. You will get more fun out of Rise of Nations - a lot more fun - or indeed Age of Mythology which was excused from the sings of this title by being specifically set in a mythological universe.I detest this game, and if ever someone takes the time to craft the game that this one was meant to be then you'd better believe I'm gonna play it's donkey off.

												I had nothing but problems with this game. First there was the key server error everyone was getting, but that was sorted out so whatever. Next, you have to run either the Asian or War Chief expansions because the game will crash if you try opening the Complete Collection. Multiplayer was a no-go because my two friends and I weren't able to create an ESO account and there isn't any way to create one outside of the game. For a game going on seven years old $44 is a complete ripoff and even being on sale for under $9 it still isn't worth all this trouble. At least the refund worked properly.			"

9/10NOTE: The hours on record are inaccurate because i've owned a pre-steam retail copy. The Age of Empires series has always been a personal favorite of mine. Dating back to the first AOE I i've been always astonished by the overall gameplay experience this game delivers. The AI system is very well written and, depending on the difficulty, will always provide a challenge. This game is often compared to Starcraft II yet there is a lot of differences between them. In Starcraft I always found myself rushing and trying to be the best, and if you were bad at the game, you were in for a lot of stress. But in AOE players can find servers with their own skill level which makes this game one of my favorite strategy games. In my opinion, you don't HAVE to play online like most competitive games. This game actually has a very good Skirmish mode where you go against bots. It may seem boring but if you give it a chance, it will not disappoint you. As for aesthetics, the graphics are great considering it was a game made in 2009 but this is just a small factor since the game's mechanics draw you away from noticing. There is rarely glitches, units walk with great animation, and the battle scenes have you urging to see what team will win. The only downfall the game has is that there is no cross-platform multiplayer support and it lacks an intriguing storyline. It is common for an AOE game to have a blan or boring storyline. And you can see that when looking at its predecessors. But don't let this change your opinion. The game wasn't really made with a basis on heartwarming or intense storyline experiences but more of a play-with-friends or AI and just have a great time.Overall, I wish they made a AOE 4. Their progression from each Age of Empires have only been big leaps in the gaming industry. But I will happily settle for AOE 3 and look forward to playing it many, many years from today. If you are in to strategy games like StarCraft, Warcraft, and Command & Conquer, this is no doubt a game worth adding to your arsenal!			"

												I have just bought the complete collection and have just installed it on steam. It then asks me to put in cd key which I did. After that it asks me to download Directplay which I click. The Windows Features just continually load for no result. I try the same thing on War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties for similar results. Any help please as I really want to play this game. I just looked at the specifications and it wanted me to have Windows XP I have Windows 10 woops.			"

												Marginally a thumbs down, and for valid reasons. Its a familiar game genre that is easy to pick up and play from scratch, and i remember enjoying this first time round, on old low-res CRT screens.  It is so close to the Settlers that most people will already know intuitively what to do.  HOWEVER...and it's a big however. It's curious that the game hasn't yet been patched or updated to play in HD res, so if you've invested in a thumping good HD flatview monitor you'll have a somewhat pixellated view whichever resolution you opt for, or maybe just stick with AOE 2 with its twee retro graphics.  The control GUI takes up far too much of the screen area, and a lot of features on the map are heaped close together and appear confused.  Things you get used to during play.  I doubt they'll patch or update this version, more likely they'll go for AOE 3 HD and get us to buy it all over again for the higher screen resolution compatibilities.  I scratch my head at Steam, for not making these things clear in the game info.  Getting to the point where they've abandoned any pretence at quality control and are happy to sell us anything.Final analysis: a glib good-clean-family-fun game by the Bill Gates Empire, except that families don't play games on computers, individuals play games on computers.  The demographic doesn't exist beyond film and TV.  They worked on assumptions back in ""those days"".  Now we know better and this would have been a slightly grittier game if they'd woken up ten years earlier.			"

												A modern classic.Storyline is a little silly but interesting.Fans of AoE and AoE2 will enjoy the final (?) installment in the series. If you've put it off the past few years, don't put it off any longer. The two expansions are rich and in spirit of the vanilla game.Multiplayer, by the time of this writing, is somewhat dead but you can still find about 400 or so dedicated multi fans online at peak times.Buy this.

												I don't think I should have to explain why Age of Empires is fun, so instead:Homemade Tortilla (for 8 servings)Prep : 30 minsCook : 25 minsIngredients :- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour- 3/4 teaspoon salt- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder- 1/4 cup vegetable shortening- 1/2 cup hot waterDirections :1. Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add vegetable shortening and work into flour mixture using a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs.2. Form a well in the middle of flour mixture and mix in hot water. Work flour and water mixture together with a fork and transfer to a cutting board.3. Knead until a smooth, soft dough is formed, about 3 minutes. Add more flour if dough is too sticky.4. Place more flour on cutting board, cover dough with bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes.5. Cut ball of dough into eight equal parts and cover until needed.6. Roll out balls of dough either by hand or with a tortilla press.7. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place flattened tortilla in skillet and cook until it begins to bubble, about 1 minute. Flip tortilla over and cook for an additional minute. Flip again and cook for 1 more minute. Repeat with remaining dough.			"

												I played this game many years ago with the disc and enjoyed countless hours of it. I now own it on steam and spend even more on it. This game is about statagy and growth. It can be every addicting with other people and even alone. The campaign is very interesting and fun. You are even able to do a skirmish mode in which you play against bots. Overall I love this game and highly reccomend it to everyone.			"

												Simplifying my gripes with the game:-No formations like in AOE2, not talking about tactics, actual formations.-Poor pathfinding, units get stuck and slowed down very often.-Clunky, busy UI. Hotkey banners get clicked on accidentally often. Too much space wasted at top, everything crammed at bottom.-Unbalanced units makes games often end up as a rock paper scissors with civilizations. Artillery is extremely OP and easy to win with, even against their counters.-Not very many civilizations.-Campaign plays completely differently than multi. It's also campy and the missions jump from too easy to too difficult.-Card system breaks games.Plenty of reasons why AOE3 is not as fondly remembered as AOE2. The real talent left Ensemble to make Rise of Nations.			"

												Okay so before i start this very short review i would like to note that though i only have 3 hours in this game i have played roughly 200+ offline in the past, before it was on steam. Also note that i am comparing this to AOE2. Okay so let me start with the plus's of this game.+Better Graphics+Bigger mapsThats just about all i can think of for plus's.When it comes to the minus's i'd like to think i have a fair comparison when looking back to aoe2 and this game. So this games ""RTS"" system is probably the most unqiue and bull♥♥♥♥♥♥excuse for a game under the genre... The games AI is broken as ♥♥♥♥, the level up system is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and dont even get me started about the varity of teams. A small thing that made AOE2 unique was the randomised team names where in AOE3 it uses actual historyical figures to play as, all of which are terribly voiced over. I can't stress enough that this game is a watered down yet stale game.I cant recommend this AOE game because it hardly even stands up as an AOE. PS: Yes AOE2 is one of my favorate games.			"

												I come from a long background with AOE1 and 2, so by comparison, this game was an overwhelming disappointment. The game is, for one, not easy to just pick up and learn. The traditional control scheme of gathering resources while building cities and armies is skewed, removing a large part of resources and troop-building altogether. Most of your income is transported from the 'homeland' to you over the course of a match, which makes sense from a colonial standpoint, but makes games painfully slow, leaves you feeling significantly less in-control of your empire, and narrows down the game into 2-3 playstyles regardless of your civilization choice. And while the game's visuals are nice, the scaling up of buildings and units alongside the 3D view leaves the maps feeling much smaller and minimizes the emphasis on careful exploration that was a landmark of previous games.AOE3 is, essentially, not reminiscient of its predecessors in any way, and can hardly be called a continuation/conclusion of the franchise: The fact that AOE2 is STILL getting support and new, regular DLCs today while this game is largely left in the dust, speaks to how few gamers made the transition.

												If you're a die hard AOE II then you'll be dissapointed in AOE III.  The best parts of AOE II is gone.  I feel like I'm playing empire earth.  Its pretty terrible.  Even though I paid $3.99 for the entire collection of AOE III.  Its not worth it.  Very dissapointed with AOE III.			"

												As a big lover of Caribbean colonial era.. this game is one of the best I've encountered in that genre.Graphics, simulation & UI is perfect for me. In my whole life, I bought 4 copies of this game.. 3 of them I lost but the 4th is on Steam so it will be with me and my future generations for good. =)			"

												I have this game since 2006 and been playing it FOR DECADES ...so...(The degradation of the game  Multiplayer experience has reached really high levels):ppl hackingdisconnecting and so on..It's a shame..Great package, great memories, not so great achievement by Microsoft, Ensemble Studios that closed downwards an ""age"" of strategy with this game and its expansion that have nothing to do with AOE II and ""The Conquerors"" which instead made history (as we all know).This game (AOE III and the expansions (2) ) has reached today a level of acidity also online that can't be called longevity, it' can't be called such at all.The missing of patches (only available today via Eso Community - an unofficial community - and that allows to play with a few players, mostly skilled ones), the fact that ESO in origin chose to put this HORRENDOUS thing of the ""military ranks"" that makes the game totally trivial and perfect for ""immature behaviour"" when looking for a match (online), or when approaching an other player, and many more WRONG doings have destroyed the future and crippled my experience.It's TRILLION LIGHT YEARS FAR from MSN GAMING ZONE, if some of you know (I doubt it since most of readers are too young) was a perfect free open space to meet and play randomly with ANYONE. Here there are classes, you can't actually get to play with all, you will be able to play just with a part of the people online, for a lot of reasons that are totally unreasonable. (ranking is one of the issues... the rest is Human failure).This game is a drug as I love strategy, but for sure there is much better then this as a strategy game.I raccomend it if you are just newbies as now it's full of new players just crashing against each other in matches (conscripts, vs concripts, privates vs privates).The ""middle class player"" (sergeant) is missing, and then there are the strong players (a ""small"" niche) only playing against each other. Actually playing with other players you don't know today is like playing slot machines, they can be ranked as you want but then in game there is zero respect of the colleague and of the enemy, I mean verbal attack are daily made, there is anyway a total unbalance for some civs that if you don't use will just turn against you.If you use French and Japan you have a big chance to win this game, Russia is strong too, the rest are just ""down graded"".Some players use the treaty mode, which requests for long long time as you need from 20 to 40 minutes, where you can't actually attack the opponent. (for me it is a waste of time)  why?It's simple. As mentioned above the Civilization (which are quite a big number) came with 2 expansions plus the original retail AOE III: of these the Asians are actually the most unbalanced (strong in relation to the others) as also is today (and stays) French (of the european batch, the original group of civs) in particular (why? Becuase of the units, they can't simply be countered, especially under a constant state of Lagging at the time where these units come in handy (late age around after 20 minutes of game) ... and you can't micro, you can't actually manage to stop them... they will cripple any possible advantage you have. I don't wanna point the finger against a civ or something in partiucular, the game is simply not balanced.The best way to balance it is just play it RUSHING (attacking at the beginning). And this happens especially in team game.The only way to play this game is knowing everything of it, and just playing what is stronger, you will just win all the time if you know how to play or have a better deck of cards (Ah yes... I forgot, this game flows as a card games as you have a deck you can choose to interact with as it was the home land sending you help that supports you)....Today the knowledge of the game has got so far from players that they (this is somehow a good thing and a bad thing) find ways to exploit the weak spots of every civ or the strong points so that today everybody knows (BOOSTING THE PREDICTABILITY of the game) that if you play Japanese against Dutch or French against dutch for example, the former(s) will have a better chance to win against the latter(s).In fact there are parts of the game you can't actually use today against skilled players because they know how to walk over that easily, it's just the game that is unbalanced and even if you improve all the units and are at the last age, there won't be a way (if they improved all the units to counter some of them), There simply isn't a way.I can mention a dozen of facts that would just make you understand this game is not OPEN. You already know when you start who is pratically going to win and lose.So, not just because of the PR (percentage of winning - which after all is not such a bad thing and it is a ""ranking"" precision information added to the already disturbing military ranking - which you start from constript and goes, private, lance corporal, corporal, sergeant, master sergeant, 1 liutenant, 2 liutenant, and so on...) but also because of the attitude of many today worst players still online, with no respect of other people time, (when playing in team with them), nor respecting them even as ""opponent"" after or during the game (If someone drops during the game do not expect someone else going out to balance a 3 v 2 where one has dropped out of connection... not at all... we will just play 3 vs 2 ... - that's the honor there is in these people and game ... disturbing and disgusting).Do not hid behind the fact that ""You are a noob"" or ""you don't know how to lose"" or ""it's just a game"".It's not just a game, we are here together to respect each other.And this rule yes, does really apply to this game community too and to real life in general.So if you wanna play, then play it, I suggest you to do it 1 v 1 .. until you find friends, with which you can rely on, you have alchemy with and you maybe can talk on Team speak or something like that.otherwise you will just waste your time on random team gaming. It's just a waste of your precious life.The predictability of the game is one of the major flows (and a game that really was fun I have played maybe 1 a year and I play a lot! ... Most of the best games are when you play with skilled players, it's fun because you can rely and if you play hard you can get the price of that effor which is THE FUN you get from the match.Otherwise a big NO NO for this game,Unbalanced CivilizationsPredictabilityRanking system that is really heavy over the human factor, self imposing, not allowing a normal exchange between people, which are not users or A.I. ... we are HUMANS. (I do understand why ESO closed, they do not understand nothing with Marketing, anthropology and much more if they chose to put in place such a public system online dividing people instead of uniting them).LaggingNew Gen. Gamers behaviour (zero honor, zero respect)All this said in an haphasarded way ... maybe but very clear to me. You play this game you just will be stressed if you do not have friends to play it with, if you believe in the game as a balalanced one (you are dead wrong).French are not the only ones, Japanese can't actually be blocked, raided, you can also use some civs against Japs, French mainly and Russians and they will constantly be tore to pieces.It's not about being a noob, this game doesn't allow to be fun for all, it has a steep learning curve at some point and for the basics of amicality, respect, fluidity, humanity in the game totally fails to deliver.Buy at your own risk.(Ah, btw, I have hundreds of hours on this game, just check on Elo rating AOE - _Tomahawk_ .. that's all).Thanks for reading the review, comment, or feedback.

												Unfortunately given its normal price, one shouldn't pay it unless you've never played it and want to play it ALL through, otherwise the costs kind of outway the benefits in this case.Why?1. Maps are very creative don't get me wrong, but the circular world doesn't really work and restricts some maps to feeling smaller than they should be.  Although when compared to AOE2 this isn't really a valid arguement, you can't create your own maps in terms of customising so most of the maps aren't great in my opinion.2.  IF YOU ARE GETTING THIS GAME FOR MULTIPLAYER, CONSIDER MY ISSUE!  I've had numerous trouble with the SOE servers which periodically times out on me resulting in a ragey loss not due to my incompitence in the game.  I assume this is their server hosting related (which unless you live in the Northern Hemisphere then you'll likely struggle to find a unlaggy game), although unless you playing with friends you could struggle with the same problems as I have.3. Singleplayer is interesting, but as to if it can really hold your interest or if its challenging enough then you might have to do your own research yourself.  I personally enjoyed it, but I wouldn't recommend it for this alone (thankfully its the complete edition so you'll have more than the base game mission series to run through).4. Graphics are nice and should be able to run on any computer made since 2007 I would say, although as I found out later its just as good as AOE1 in terms of content and playablility.5. How units are created really bothers me for some reason in this game.  Although its nice not to have to click 40 times for 40 units on a building, spitting out 10 soldiers and only 1 'demoman' hasnt really made me any better off especially because depending on what civilisation you pick only a handful of units are worth having.  Oh, and before I forget about population issues your not allowed to build trading posts anyway or exceed a certain number of houses either!Sure get it on sale if you really want to have a bash, but don't get your hopes up too far because many other games made 10 years ago in my opinion deserve more attention or have better pro's than this game can offer (sadly).

												I really love this game and it's one of the most fun games I've ever played. So why the negative review you might ask?Well, multiplayer is garbage. I played 1-2 days and then it stopped working, only giving me some errors. I tried to solve it, tried every solution, and finally realized that if these steps didn't help, I would need a new router. But I can't do that, my ISP forces me to use it, otherwise my TV wouldn't work, as they're tied together.TL;DR - buy this game if you only want to play singleplayer - multiplayer is trash.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												I bought this game at a discounted price of $7 which is the only way you should pick this game up since the price will match the content in this game.Age of Empires 3 is a joke without any DLC you have like 4 or 5 nations to choose from and a few maps, which would be ok if the game was not $40.Next, this ""RTS"" game has many issues with the single player and multy player, first the multy player since thats the easist to cover, it doesn't work, like at all, i tried to get a game going with a friends since as I said I had bought it for $7 so if it sucked I wouldn't be too mad, but it just doesn't work at all which makes me mad, I would have been fine with there were some connection issues or latency since the games so old but no, just doesn't even start.Secondly the single player which is divided into Skirmish mode and story, the story I found lack luster and not as interesting as AoE 2 stories, and secondly Skirmish mode, this mode got wrecked, Maps are way too small and we all know how Age of Empires AI was and still is SUPER agressive, well small maps just make that worse since you now have to rush around with your villagers to gather resources to get to the next age before the AI does and comes over with cannons and kills you.Lastly is the card system, while I enjoy it because it makes the game slightly more easy to new and old comers alike, that still does not give this game a pass for punishingly hard AI and really no totorial since you would think that you would get one in the story right, not really their idea of a totorial is just throw them into the heat of battle and tell them how to make units, what building makes what unit, and the time and resouces it takes to make said unit, not what unit is best to kill what unit, you kind of have to go off common sense with that one, like samurai (you only have samurai if you get the asian DLC) what do samurai kill the fastest because it's not infantry like you think it would be, but they seem to kill light cavlery the fastest.all in all if you pick this game up at a discounted prices like I did you can't complain too much but if you do pick this up keep in mind that this will be a solo game with some seriously cut content, but if your looking for a game like this and don't care about price get Age of Empires 2, it has more content, less DLC and is like $20 cheaper.

												Nope. Fun for a while, but the utterly terrible ai (AoM has MUCH better ai) and poor (Win7) optimization ruins it. 20 fighting units on screen will sometimes drag the framerate to single-digit levels. May work better on older hardware, perhaps?The game is quite dumbed down compared to the previous games. This may be good or bad depending on your taste. For me it is bad.The ESO (online mode) is down a lot, and the games lose connection frequently. Playing through a VPN solved that, though. I probably have 50ish hours outside steam's counter.			"

												DO NOT BUT THIS IF YOU DO NOT OWN AGE OF EMPIRE'S 2, AOE2 is so much better in every single way. this game is overall a downgrade in quality. In AOE2 it contains many more features, custom map building, steam workshop texture packs, characters, maps. this contains none of what i just listed. DO NOT BUY			"

												I was disappointed with this game, primarily because of a few things they chose not to include in the game:You CANNOT SAVE MULTIPLAYER GAME. They took that option out. If the game crashes you're out of luck. Start all over again.Also, not sure if you can see the chat history in the game either.I feel this game had great potential, but when you force the player to finish it in one setting and pray that it doesnt crash on any of the players because THERE ARE NO SAVES then it becomes rather frustrating. Age of empires 2 and Empire Earth are much better choices.			"

												Hello readers,Age of Empires 3. To start off, the game has been turned into a cartoon. It feels very solid and is certainly not like the original: AoE2. The RTS on this game is a lot more smaller scale and the gameplay feels fixed.If you want to buy an age of empires, going for number 2 would be your best bet.I rate it a 4.5/10			"

												This game blows. Do not waste your money on this trash, like seriously. I know that it's newer than Age of Empire II but trust me, AoE II is a much better game. This game lacks so many features that the second one had that made it great. Somehow, the more modern graphics seem like a step backwards from the graphics of AoE II. I just can't get the same fun out of this game that I can out of the second one. Every time I load this crap up and get to the garbage main menu (don't even get me started on creating an account and logging in) I feel the urge to load up AoE II.			"

												OKAY,im not going too touch up on the game but im going too say this. WHY DID YOU TAKE AWAY THE DLC PACKS?!?!?!?! without both dlcs this game is an ovverrated strategy game that feels less complete than age 2. if you cant find the dlc packs for asian dynasties and the warcheifs then just play age 2. they literally expect 10 purley european races (except maybe ottomans) too be satisfactory which is a JOKE compared too the amount of races and technologies in age 2, not too mention the most ♥♥♥♥ED part about this game is you have FORCED ALLIES! thats right you start the game and end the game with the same allies, there is no forging of alliances because of battlefield circumstance or betrayal like in age 2,which in my opinion was a gold star for the game.   IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED AGE 2 TRUST ME WHEN I SAY BUY THAT FIRST BEFORE YOU TOUCH THIS OVER PRICED WHITE SUPREMECY GAME LOL			"

												This wouldn't be a bad game, 15 years ago, and I understand it is an older game. However, given it's initial release date was 2005, I am going to review it's gameplay based on the common expectation of features, and it's current playable status based on compatability with modern computers.Compairing this to standard RTS of the time that had been released prior to this one, starcraft and warcraft, it is seriously lacking. Units have no special controls that were standard by 2005 such as attack move, patrol, ect. your only option is attack and move, and hope your units are capable of figuring out what to attack.The storyline is great, it's interesting and engaging, however quirky, and without adding spoilers, it tries to be historically accurate as far as timeline and unit names, however it is like the entire story and themes were created by someone who never achieved a higher grade than C- in history.The hero unit voices are so repetitive it will make you want to not use them just so you do not have to hear them. As far as current compatability, this game works fine with current Windows 7 8 10, however my biggest issue is the size of the interface, it seems like despite the game being made compatible for larger screens, it didn't scale correctly, which makes the entire gameplay feel very claustrophobic on larger screans (higher than 1080).I would give this game a 4/10, but most would rate it higher, it's worth trying if interested and you can get over the above mentioned problems, but for me it was just too many announces to really make it fun to play.

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			"

												My friends convinced me to get this game but after playing around 4 hours of multiplayer and 2 of single player, I've decided it isn't for me. The graphics keep bugginf out so there is a little sliver on the right side of my screen on at the bottom where the game doesn't ""exist"". I mean that I can't access buttons down there or see graphics but I can see my home screen. I constantly experience lag while playing multiplayer no matter who is host. I also don't like the graphics. Given, it is an 8 year old game but I still just don't like it. And lastly, the UI is just a bit too busy for me.			"

												Age of Empires III only really has one problem. It's not an Age of Empires game. Gone are the truly massive maps where layers upon layers of walls and fortress barricaded your way to the enemy stronghold. Gone are the contest for resource locations where everything from half-naked barbarians to well dressed musketeers would throw themselves into certain death just to save that last stone mine.It is a game that has lost any sense of character and identity. The combat is a garbled mess without any use for formations, flanking or even tactics. The maps are small and boring. The campaigns bring nothing new to the table and the units are nothing but rock, paper, scissor stand-ins.Age of Empires was a great series and this is the game that killed it. Age Of Empires III is a shell of a game and why anyone would chose this game over Age of Kings is beyond me. It simply isn't worth it.			"

What i liked, graphics,  the concept of a homecity that grows as you play, i bought it cheap.What i didn't like.  Lacked in content compaired to other Age of Empires games, The homecity concept was poorly done and pretty much pointless, even the largest maps was small , it just didn't do the title of AoE justice at all.

												How to talk about the game without being too negative?It really is a wasted potential, but there is just to many things that are horrible for it to be worth it. I really did give it my attention and i wanted to like it, but it's crap, honestly.Horrible UI, nonsensical Hotkeys, terrible Unit acknowledgment all the time, insanely bad voiceacting, crap mission designs, worst unit-AI ever. Give me another minute and i can list quite a few other tidbits that are wrong. It's got Microsoft Game Studios written all over it, and i mean that in a bad way yes.But there are good stuff in here as well! It had potential. Hometown, cards, old Warcraft feeling to resource gathering, upgradable units, boss-units, cannons! But it's not enough.How the series is so popular (i judge from AoE3 only) i cannot fathom.I'd rather play Kohan or something then this. What a wast of time.			"

												The game is great! But the main reason I pay for this is to play online. That's impossible, cuz I am getting constantly ""version missmatch"". I ask for refound, and I am getting this from steam: -""You have played over 2 hours or your game was purchased more than 2 weeks.""Here is the thing. Ofcourse I have played the game in single player, to build my level and XP, so I can have a chance when playing online with someone. But when I tried to play with my brother and some friends, there was always a problem with ""version missmatch"" I contacted with Microsoft Studios, with Microsoft no support at all. I read on internet, and I see I am not the only one. There was instructions to try and fix it. Reinstalling the game, checking if my files are not edited (some cheaters do that) -nothing helped! I uninstall the game and I am asking for refound, and steam won't let me. You shouldn't sell 11 years old game, and not having any support! When I was kid, I couldn't pay for games, I just downloaded pirated versions. Now, I can afford it so I would like to support the developers. This times there is no developer behind, just steam thieves! Sorry about that Steam.			"

												Personally I never owned AoE3 growing up and coming to it later on I can say it has not aged particularly well.Unlike the new AoE2:HD release, increasing the resolution unfortunately does not allow you to see more. Usually this is typical of competitive RTS games in order to keep the playing field even. Unfortunately how much is shown to you on screen is limited at best, especially when groups of units grow beyond the screen size, a particular issue when moving across a map with multiple unit types of varying speeds. AoE3 sports a more to-ground camera perspective causing vision to be obscured by walls or buildings to a far greater degree than the other AoE games. Not helping this is how the buildings are absolutely massive (houses are huge!) while this might make it seem like your town is more impressive than it is, navigating your town in a pinch can be very fiddly.Combat is unbalanced and to be fair, pretty broken. units can be queued but are all produced on the same timer. For example you can make 1 musketeer, or 5 at once in the same time. This all but removes the need to spend any resources until you need them. Most games I find end very quickly both online and against a computer.Unlike AoE3, the only realistic way to win is through combat, immeditae and unrelenting combat, removing a large portion of what an AoE game means to me. Naval combat has however improved significantly over previous installments, sporting a wide range of galleons and some very pleasing combat animations and damage manifesting visually through holes, masts falling and other immersive effects in constrast to AoE2's all-purpose flames.Overall I cannot recommend this game however I can see how it could appeal to those looking for a more basic RTS than is typically offered by the AoE franchise.

												I am a huge fan of the Age of Empires series in general, but for the most part AoE III just did not sit well with me. The graphics were good, but unfortunately that's about where to the good ended for me. I enjoyed the first few missions, but after that I began to dislike how the game was structured. For one, the maps were much too small compared to many AoE II campaign maps, but maybe it only seems that way because the HUD takes up a HUGE portion of the screen and is zoomed in more than other games making you blind to things 100 yards away. I can see myself playing through because it is nostalgic. The AoE franchise is one of the things I can attribute my love of gaming to and it has points for me from that. AoE III unfortunately is at the bottom of the list in terms of which I would recommend to a virgin of the series. If you can, pick up AoE (the first one, and don't skip Rise of Rome!!) or even better pick up AoE II on Steam.			"

												As someone looking primarily for a single-player RTS, I have to say I was disappointed. There are some interesting ideas and designs to this game, but as a single player experience I don't think either the campaign or the skirmish mode measure up, and I'd say in many ways inferior to games that came out 2-3 years earlier (Age of Myth, Rise of Nations, Warcraft III, etc.).What I liked:As a concept, the home city idea was very interesting. As a practical measure, I found myself using basically the same combo of cards every playthrough. It did make for occasional surprises (to be attacking an enemy city when they suddenly cashed in a bunch of units in your midst), but by and large, it became routine pretty quickly.   -Graphics are good, though some framerate issues even without settings maxedWhat I didn't like:-AI is terrible. In most of the campaign, you'd have to make a pretty major mistake to actually lose. I didn't really have any need to learn the unit counters until the last scenario in Act II (which can largely be won by exploiting a single counter).  By the same token, your own units will wander off and get themselves killed more often than you'd like.-Unit control isn't great. And sad that a 2005 release doesn't let you put units in multiple groupings. Want a group for all artillery for and a subgroup for just cannons for combat precision?  Too bad!-Reward for advancing ages was implemented better in the earlier 'Age of Mythology.' There the rewards represented actual tactical choices with pros/cons. Here the proper choice is often a given. ""Let's see - do I want a boat reward on this map with no water or whatever option B is?""Maybe this game is great for multi-player, I can't say. But as single-player goes, it was disappointing.  Honestly I can't say it would even make my RTS top 10, despite the few things it does do well.			"

												AoE III is one of the well known RTS of all time. This make me felt I really want to play this game. Unfortunately, maybe it just me or the game mechanic is not my type. I felt struggle about control in both control unit, micro management unit and event the screen itself.I choose the 1080p resolution but it still I can see the battlefield in very limited area. I wish I can it from more far distant. I try to scroll down the mouse wheel but it won't work. maybe it's the farest I can see which I think this is limited my view of the battlefiled on screen.on the first mission, the game ask me to use Crossbow man to kill enemy outside the gate, I felt struggle to control those unit because it keep moving out to the outside of the gate. I do not sure the game has ""hold position"" command to the unit or not. This keep constantly lost unit and cause me lose the battle in the end.after spend more time to try and lose again and again, I realize it later I can create more unit but with such a limited resource and enemy has like infinity resource to overwhelm my base, I felt this game is not fun. at least, it's not for me.later on, I can pass the first mission. The later mission seems reasonable and do not pressure player like the first one. I can play and keep proceed next 4-5 missions so far but still I do not feel fun factor from it at all. maybe the worst experience I perceived during the first mission keep huant me. After that, I felt this game is not for me and I just uninstall it.If you are a novice player like me, I do not recommend you to get this game unless you try it before you buy. Otherwise, you will not feel this game fun for you and regardless how good the graphic it is, not fun = not enjoyable.			"

												This game is fun, I grant you. However, it is not nearly as good as it seems from the pictures and trailer. The graphics are not very good, the pictures are bad representations of the game. The AI builds up way to fast and by the time you have a few buildings and units ready, they have already ammassed an army and destroy your city. I wish Steam has a return policy.			"

												They should call this Age of Empires Not. I've always liked Microsoft Games Division because they made quality games. I've been an AoE player as long as I can remember, but this is not AoE. Here's why.Someone in a meeting during the development of this game, who has obviously never played the game,  must have raised their hand and said these 10 Things;1. Hey, you know that scenario creator thing? No one really uses that, and the ones that do really don't like it being so easy to use. So let's make one that's much harder to use. 2. Let's don't let them save game when testing a scenario so it can be played as a game later. No one does that. 3. And those random maps? Ah, you know they don't use that so let's take that out too. 4. When selecting an AI, instead of just selecting one for the computer, let's make them also place objects in the game to make it actually work.5. And here's something really fun to them. When they create a scenario and choose human for player 1, computer for all the other empires, and select AI's for the computer players, here comes the fun part; When they go to play the scenario, we'll switch them from player 1 to another player instead. They'll find that really funny!6. And you know those formations that you could use in older versions of AoE? I don't think anyone uses that. Let's remove that.7. Patrols? Why would they want their troops to patrol? Nah. Take that out too.8. And you know those towers? People build way too many of them. No one needs more than 7, so let's put a limit on them. Even if one player gathers more resources, they shouldn't be allowed to build unlimited towers. No one should ever build more than 7 in my opinion and people should play it the way I would play it, not just any way they want to.9. Same with Ships. They shouldn't build so many, so let's limit that too.10. Oh and this one is real important. Players used to have the ability to place waypoints from their barracks, stables, etc. at an enemy location and fill the queue with 15 troops from each one and if it was more than the population limit, they wouldn't be made until the pop fell below the limit. Instead, in the new AoE, let's not let them schedule those troops in advance. If they want reinforcements, make them go back and do that during the attack so the other player gets a break.Those aren't all of the problems with the new AoE compared to the excellent older AoE versions, so other people who never played the game must have also raised their hands too.

												Being a long time fan of Age of Empires: 2, I bought this game a long time ago, way before it came to steam. At that time I thought it was mediocre, the mechanics being odd, why do some things require buildings and some do not? There are no great ways to get resources, everything costs more and takes longer to build so you are looking at lower villager counts but higher resource costs, it is ridiculous. Much harder to build a good economy and military. Also there is the fact that you can build gunpowder units at the same time as archaic units. Why would you use crossbowmen when you could have musketeers? The two didn't exist at the same points and so it makes the game ""feel"" weird. Not to mention everything is in a frontier/colonial era. Why are there pikemen at all? Makes no sense. All in all this is a horrible sequel to the amazing second installment and I will be spending my time on the second one.			"

												I was expecting the same level of fun that the first two Age of Empires gave, but I didn't exactly recieve that. Let me just say that the game feels...small...in comparison to other games like it and to its own games. There are only a few unit types, the research and upgrades feel dull, the maps are a little weird, and the UI looks really bad for 2009. (Sure the UI shouldn't give the game a lower score but it is the one continous thing on your screen the whole time playing which can help you find buttons and/or match the game so it doesn't look out of place) Also there really is no strategy, as you just need a more researched army and big a economy. On top of this the Campaign is uninteresting and the weird home city hub never truly fascinated me. Nothing feels dynamic it all feels linear.And lastly the AI feels like it has an upper hand when I was playing on Normal, as their cities weren't as built up as mine for most of the game. Now here are the good parts about the game. Graphics are solid, Building Destruction is nice, Units speak in their native language, building management, and resource gathering is perfect.My FINAL SCORE is, (5/10) I love rts games but this feels weak compared to past installments and other rts games. If this game was 20$ I would be happier but this costs 40$!! And this game feels way too short with little variety to keep the ages feeling bigger and last longer. Thank you for your time.			"

												Don't buy this game for it's name. Actually, it's a shame for the outstanding AoE franchise.AoE III is a wonderful game, with good graphics and enough in-game possibilities (i'm talking about buildings and characters), but it lacks the supremacy of AoE II and AoE.This game looks like the developers wanted to make a game that would ressemble the very first Empire Earth. Well, it doesn't. - Remember that awesome feeling in AoE II and EE when changing the map size to 'gigantic' and you had no idea where to start exploring first? You won't find it here. According to me, this game stands or falls with the scale of its maps.- Also a big fail is the building-aspect. You don't have the feeling, when building your houses and military buildings, that you're constructing a city. After putting your, let's say 20, buildings close to each other and in an structurised manner, it looks like a mismatched slum of the 14th century which you want to put on fire. I know, some of you will say: 'Oy, AoE isn't about building, it's the fighting that counts!' And i'll even say they're correct. But be honest with yourselves, it's the whole that counts, isn't it?- Another, rather 'stupid', improvement is the fact that in-game you have the possibility to make your homecountry deliver supplies (troops, food and villagers). Seriously, who gives a damn for this? This makes you feel incompetent for playing this game, since you'll have to 'beg' for help. Not a nice feeling, not?The lot of you will buy Age of Empires III for the name and because you expect it to be even better than AoE II and EE. But don't be fooled by the name, nor the metacritic score; this game isn't worth buying for the full price.In sale? Well, yeah, with a 75% Steam sale.			"

												Unlike 2, AOE 3 is all about the graphics. To be honest i prefered the graphics of AOE 2, 3 feels unspacious, cramped and just too much. The gameplay has been simpled down and is generally just too easy. It no longer requires much multi tasking skills to both maintain your economy and your military.Age of Empires 3 is still a good game but in my opinion has nothing on Age of Empires 2 and is overpriced.

												as a veteran of the RTS genre there are a few words I’d have for this gamelets start with what is good. for a game made in 2005 it has very good graphics. And the way buildings fall apart when damaged is very satisfying. There are ALOT of choices for what units to build.That being said there are far more negatives in my opinionthe controls are clunky at best and hot keys are far from intuitive or fast. The 'cards' add a level of complexity that is completely unnecessary. The units and their counters are so hard that there is almost no point to getting more then the other guy and if you don't have the perfect mix to take him down there is almost no chance to heavily damage his army let alone kill it. Field artillery is far over powered. Workers are absurdly expensive but I suppose that was a balance decision to make up for the fact the resource gathering and macro, if you can call it that, is so simple that it makes where to send your workers to gather minerals in starcraft seam arduous. Factions are far from balanced and not in the good way that promotes a healthy meta game. The computer AI if you can call it that is a joke and needs some serious attention. Battles even when they are at peak seam sluggish or everything is dead before any exchange has happened and micro is almost a joke.In conclusion. Never buy this game when it's not on sale and your money would be far better spent buying age of empires two and it's expansion for cheaper			"

												I pretty much instantly gave up on this game as the mechanics regarding the home cites are just so insanely bad i will not waste my time with this. While a neat concept in theory, the fact that you have to level them up, turns the game in to a grindfest. There is no really reason for this, all it does is to force you to invest a lot of time to get the full experience and all options the game has to offer.While it is easily to edit the files for the SP game, i am still not sure if such an option exists for MP and i frankly have no desire to bother with this any more.  It was a horrible design decision that ruins the game for anyone who cannot be botherd to grind though it.			"

												Fantastic if you don't have any wish to play online. Somehow, they've managed to send the same CD key to multiple people and only one online account may be registered per CD key, I have found multiple people online who've suffered the same. So far AoE and Steam customer support have been all but non existant and the redirect to Microsoft support was useless. It's a real shame because this is beautiful, clever game, but I brought it for the multiplayer with a group of friends, unfourtunately I lucked out and got the second-hand CD key. I wouldn't risk purchasing it again knowing this.If I actually recieve a response/reimbursement or solution from any of my attempts at contacting support I might be inclined to recommend this game, as yet, it's a firm no.

												This game does have some good things although I have found that Age of Empires 2 has more to offer than Age of Empires 3.Reason I would choose AoE2 over AoE3..- More people to choose- More structures to build- Larger maps- More customizability- Easier to create things and understand things.- Better customizable economy (can choose to start with 500 of each resource and work your way up from scratch vs 20k to start)- Stone resource. (Some may argue this makes it harder and more of a BS resource but at the same time, its not a max out and win game.)- Stronger structures with more unit specializes.- More of a story- A lot more.Things AoE3 has against AoE2- Better graphics- Better UI- One off screen to choose things to summon in from, ""Levels""- Level up (One hero that you normally need to ransom to get anywhere.)- If you group someone into group 1 and hold down the 1 button, it doesn't stop the unit dead in its tracks (Until the button is released.)If your going to buy this game, wait for it to go on sale otherwise your wasting your money..If your going to buy AoE2 and like stratedgy games that you can waste hours on end, then buy it any time. I could easily sink a day in just playing a couple games without realizing that I just went from 8am to 11pm, having missed work due to forgetting the time.			"

												Honestly? ♥♥♥♥ this game.I was a fan of Aoe 2, and I've had a lot of fun with it, so i picked this up to see if I could enjoy it too.The tutorial went well-ish, not very interesting, even by RTS standards. noteable that they get rid of the usual RTS tutorials in favor of just giving you a skirmish round with a narorator as you do♥♥♥♥♥♥After that, tried campaign. Not fun, gave up.Tried a skirmish mission on the very easiest difficulty, with the intent of learning the ropes. Built  a base. felt a little insubstantial. Built army. Charged into battle against one of my enemies. Killed their army with heavy casualties, okay. started attacking base, and was mulched by their incoming allies. My allies then say ""You suck, we should just give up because we'll lose no matter what.""New army, new attack, same result. Allies do nothing, insult me.So ♥♥♥♥ you Aoe3, wasn't a hard game to make a fun sequel to, you didn't have to change almost anything. Do. Not. Buy. At 10$ It wasn't worth it.			"

												Do NOT buy this game.  The UI is half-@ssed; another grind-for-gear fest.= Graphics =+ Water looks beautiful !+ Ships are properly to scale -- they are BIG !+ Physics for destroying buildings and units look great -- especially heavy artillery !- Icons for buildings and units are extremely bland; ALMOST as bad as ""Ultima Online.""- Every 3D model in game is ""fully lit"" making it hard to recognize things you CAN click on and things you CAN'T click on.  The artists didn't understand Contrast ratio nor S/N ratio -- it is TOO HARD to find when crates or bags of gold get delivered to your colony due to foreground objects blending into background objects.  See this excellent talk to understand how to do background + foreground + UI properly:http://gdcvault.com/play/1015306/The-Art-of-Diablo= Gameplay =+ New card system is interesting- You have to *grind* to unlock cards for EACH city and civilization  You can no longer select your civilization in multiplayer; you must first build a home city.   LAME.- Teams are limited to 2 instead of 4 as in AoE2 so you can no longer have multiple, separate, computer teams.- You can only reset your deck ONCE !?!? More grind-for-gear crap.- Stone resource removed from the game. :-(- Computer AI cheats like crazy in Hard and Expert. (See next post for details)= UI =* The default camera zoom is too close to the ground.  Change ""Camera Zoom"" to ""Very Far"" in ""Game Options"" to fix.- Selecting a group no longer shows the individual health bars -- it is extremely hard to tell WHICH unit needs healing- The UI chews up 1/3 of your screen (WHY??) unless you go into Options and turn on ""Enable Minimized UI.""  - When you are unable to unlock a card the error message is too generic and doesn't tell you WHY.- No ""TEAM"" icon next to cards to EASILY tell which cards benefit the team.- Stupid default UI settings.  Why is ""Show Gathers per Resource"" OFF by default??- The status bar at the top in AoE2 that was easy to read of resources summary has been moved to the clunky bottom UI where it blends in making it WAY too hard to read.- Tooltips for buildings and units don't work if the item is in the queue.  *facepalm*- There is no option to remember your password; 2013 and still no auto-login??- Creating a multiplayer game with a password requires you press a retard ""Password Protected"" button IN ADDITION to typing in the password. Gee, how about using a -blank- password to determine if the game is password protected or not like every other online game??- Can only have 9 groups instead of 20 in AoE2- Can only have 50 units in a group instead of 75 as in AoE2- Can only have 200 max population with no way to increase it.  This _IS_ 2013 and we have quad-core computers these days ... why can AoE2HD be patched to up the limit but this game can't?- Hotkey for Flares was removed *sigh*- You MUST _first_ create an ES Online account with the ORIGINAL game, THEN you can ""upgrade"" it with the Expansion.  LAME.- The password box doesn't work in the original host game UNLESS you press the TAB key. LAME.= Support =MS Support are a bunch of R.E.T.A.R.D.S.  I misspelt my ES Online name and there is no way to either rename or delete your account !?!?  WTF is this ... 1977 ?Edit: Fixed spelling mistakes, added note about computer AI cheating.Edit.2 Valve censoring ""re-tard"" is lame.			"

												Honestly? ♥♥♥♥ this game.I was a fan of Aoe 2, and I've had a lot of fun with it, so i picked this up to see if I could enjoy it too.The tutorial went well-ish, not very interesting, even by RTS standards. noteable that they get rid of the usual RTS tutorials in favor of just giving you a skirmish round with a narorator as you do♥♥♥♥♥♥After that, tried campaign. Not fun, gave up.Tried a skirmish mission on the very easiest difficulty, with the intent of learning the ropes. Built  a base. felt a little insubstantial. Built army. Charged into battle against one of my enemies. Killed their army with heavy casualties, okay. started attacking base, and was mulched by their incoming allies. My allies then say ""You suck, we should just give up because we'll lose no matter what.""New army, new attack, same result. Allies do nothing, insult me.So ♥♥♥♥ you Aoe3, wasn't a hard game to make a fun sequel to, you didn't have to change almost anything. Do. Not. Buy. At 10$ It wasn't worth it.			"

												Horrible game. the interface is so basic and they have added a load of crap that really detracts from the good old values of age of empires.Skirmish mode is outragously restrictive. you have a very limited choice of map types. what ever happened to good old islands ?i selected a map to play only to realise that all my villagers walk away to do what ever they feel like doing ? seiously?really do not reccomend this game.

												A part en simplification Age of Empires III n'a pas gagné beaucoup par rapport au mythique Age of Empires II et les graphismes sont à peine mieux. En bref...une erreur / Age of Empires III isn't better than its predecessor and is even simpler with slightly better graphics. In short...forget about it.			"

I tried to find any solution all over internet, including steam and windows forums but found nothing. So i can say nothing about this game because i faced a problem (and not only me. many people did) that doesn't allow me to run it. So the game, the support (both steam and windows) are awfull. Thank you.			"
