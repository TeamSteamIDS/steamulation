												Great boardgame!This is an abstract game, with easy to learn rules, but with as much depth as Chess, or Go. Put some thought into your moves, and you'll have a wonderful time with this game :)			"

												Love the board game and this is a good port.  AI is decent enough, but seems to weaken with the added DLC, perhaps due to their complexity?  Anyway, got it for 75% off ($4) and it was worth that.  I waited for the sale because if I was going to pay $16, I may as well get a friend another board game of it and play offline.Get it on sale at around $4-5 and you won't be disappointed.  You may even want to get the board game version and rejoin the real world (ok maybe not).7.5/10			"

												When one measures the strength of a game that is an adaption of a previous title to a new medium, it becomes vital that one takes into account the strengths and weaknesses of both the original and the quality of the implementation of the new game.  The version of Hive I played is a pre-release version and thus subject to changes, but with 6 hours under my belt I feel I am able to give at least a reasonable assessment of what BlueLine Game Studios[bluelinegamestudios.com] have done with Gen42 Games' work.Published in 2001, the original Hive is a strategy board game without a board, like with Settlers of Catan the game uses a hex based tile system to create the environment of play, but Hive differs greatly from the beloved German classic.  Hive has no fixed play area, it's tiles are it's units and can be played and moved based on a very Chess-like set of structured rules.  The game is an enjoyable and varied one which lets players go through a game quickly against their opponent with no need to set up the board or learn too many rules.  An additional bonus to the game is that it is largely language-agnostic, once the rules are known nothing in the game requires any kind of reading to cause issues between players.This PC version of the game sticks well to the original game and implements the ruleset in a very by-the-book manner that gives no room for house rules, like modifying the unit list of the two players, which is a double edged sword - on one hand you aren't overloaded with a multitude of options in your face from the onset, but you are also limited in what you can do with the game, there are no handicaps.  The game comes with the original Hive's expansion, the Pillbug, a single unit that most players would make a cardboard stand-in for when playing the physical game, in the game as purchasable DLC, which most PC gamers will agree has a sting to it, after seeing the PC version of Settlers of Catan, called simply Catan, one would hope all developers put as much love into their titles, including all expansions and many differing options for how to play.Artificial Intelligence in this game on the lower levels is not overly resource hungry, but suffers from being a little daffy at times, on the highest level the opposite is true however.  When playing on the 5th difficulty level you can occasionally wait a couple of minutes as it plays out possible moves it can take before settling on one and it makes for a much better fight, if a sometimes boring wait.The musical selection is somewhat boring and repetitive, the game has a single and rather short track that repeats before you eventually disable audio playback after hour one of the song playing with your mind.  One assumes it is a placeholder awaiting a little more variety in the playlist.Interface for the game is a rather bare-bones at this stage, clean and responsive, but not overly attractive.  The camera auto-zooms and includes the entire play area in your view, this is again both a good and bad thing, as I could find no means to change my camera angle, which is helpful in a game when you are in a difficult situation and want to get a fresh perspective on the game.  Tool tips are in your face, unavoidable, and unclosable, you have to wait on them to fade away on their own, which is quite bothersome when you only want to see if a unit can move or not.  There is presently no customization to the game, one cannot change the game's colours, nor use alternative tilesets to make the game more aesthetically appealing.As there are no options to change resolution, modify volume, go to fullscreen instead of windowed mode, or change the graphics of the tiles, the game feels a little more limited than what many PC gamers might expect or even demand from a game.  But the game is enjoyable in spite of it's presently simple presentation, one hopes that BlueLine will take what they have and move forward with the ability to control the camera, to change tilesets, unit lists and add a little more polish to the visual and auditory aspects of the title.  I can easily say the game is a good one, I am just unsure if Steam users will be able to get past it's aesthetic limitations to the boardgame underneath.  For strategy board game fans, this is likely a no-brainer to pick it up, but others will probably be less enthusiastic about the title as when it comes to boardgame adaptions, PC gamers tend to be more into Axis and Allies level complexity, and less into Chess.

												Análisis en español aquí[tny.cz]I can barely recomend this game. It is good but a small amount of issues makes it not so pleasurable as it should.*IntroductionFor start I should explain what this game is about, without going into details about the rules and moves of each type of piece.Hive is a well known tabletop game for two player. It doesn't use a board, instead players take turns to place or move their hexagonal pieces (representing bugs) contacting one another and thus forming the playing area (hive). Each type of piece has its own move (like chess). The goal is surround the opponent's queen bee while we protect our own queen.Hive is a very good game, awarded over here and over there, by these and those people. The description of the Steam store handles make it clear that it is a awarded game. It's a game with not too much rules to learn, easy to play. Still the game has a lot of strategy to consider. Move or place? Attack or defend? Which and how many bugs play or conserve?*GameplayThe game stays true to the rules of the tabletop game and therefore it's played practically the same, except for the difference we not have to wonder if every move is valid. Just click on on of your pieces and it will be show the places where we can place it with another click.About the AI, it can take too long time to decide to move, especially in higher difficulties, so the match will always be interrupted. Also the AI is not very smart in higher difficulties.*Graphic user interfaceThe menu is simple and minimalist. That is usually good, but this time it's taken to the extreme scarcing in basic options such as selecting screen resolution.When a match is created you can choose how to compete with our rival (remember that it's a two players game). We can play against artificial intelligence on 5 difficulties, on line through Steam, and two local modes, each player with its own peripheral (keyboard and gamepad) or sharing the same peripheral (pass and play).During the match, the playground is a wooden surface, on which we will place the pieces. The pieces are placed or moved, first by clicking them and then clicking on one of the marked areas. The pieces can't be dragged.We can control the point of view but not the zoom, which is automatically adjusted to make visible all pieces.*AudioIt can be summarized as boring and repetitive. Little choice and very boring. I know it must not distract players, but it is soooo boring that is annoying and you will end up turning it off. As a curiosity I can mention that some sound effects and music are free from Freesound.org and OpenGameArt.* Online gamingAs multiplayer game, online gaming should be an important part. In this section we can create and join public and private lobby, although the private ones can only be joined by invitation.It has an ELO rating system (like chess and go). This is a scoring system to calculate the skill level of the players. So when creating a game we can choose whether we want it to be ""rated game"" or not. That is if we want to bear in mind that rating system for the match or not.It doesn't have online player waiting to play. It's one of those games you must play with friends since you can not find random players.An important negative point is that the online game often fails, forcing you to restart it. That doesn't always happen, only in matches you think you are going to win. I don't know how that affects your score because I have not played with that option enabled, but I suspect it should not be good since my opponent informed me that the game notify him I abandoned the match when it failed and we had to start another one.One last detail in this section. The game requires Steam to play online. An important detail to note as it is advertised as DRM-free on the dev's website via Humble widget.*DLCSomething you should know is that the game is incomplete, it has missing pieces. These missing pieces are sold separately as DLC. As a result you get an incomplete game and additional parts cost almost as much as the base game ($10 base game and $3 each of 3 DLC, $19 total), although there are discounts for purchasing bundles. Unfortunately, developers planned to sell the game this way from the begining. Probably they developed the game thinking about the DLC. They justify this by comparing it with the physical version of the game (a comparison that does not seem appropriate to me). As if that were not enough to buy an intentionally incomplete game, each DLC gives only one piece which is distasteful (remember that it's about pieces of a tabletop game, not hats or skins). These extra pieces already existed at the time of game release, they didn't have to think and create new pieces.If you own a DLC, you can use it in a match although your competitor doesn't own it, both player obtaining additional parts. That means that content is included for all in the game and is not an optional extra download, but is locked until you shell out more money. Note that we talk about pieces of a tabetop game and not about hats or cosmetic items, for a paid game, not a F2P in which would be acceptable.Pros:+ It's Hive and maintains its rules.+ Online multiplayer.+ It has artificial intelligence so that those who are ""forever alone"" can enjoy it.Cons:- DLC based business model. The game is incomplete and you must pay almost double for the extra pieces (every DLC offers one miserable piece). $19 for the full game is very overpriced for a game like this with all the drawbacks.- Repetitive and boring music.- Few options. Not much to modify to your pleasure. You can not change the game screen resolution, to do this you must change the desktop resolution. You can not control the zoom.- Artificial intelligence is slow. This is more noticeable in higher difficulties.- No online players (though no fault of the game).- DLC. I have already said it, no?- It is only available in English. It is not necessary to know english to play if you know the rules. Conversely, if you do not know them, you must learn them in english. Language can be a barrier and this may impair the growth of the community.- Online matches usually fail.- No low-end system friendly.I should mention that many of the comments and analysis  I read are outdated. Some corrections:- Camara and perspective. Now we can move the camera, but the zoom is adjusted automatically.- Options. You can play in windowed mode or full screen and can also change the volume of music (can be lowered to not hear it) and sound effects. Can not change the resolution yet.- Appearance and aesthetics. Now you can choose the tileset between 3 options: Standard (with 3D bugs), Classic (as the classical version of the game) and Carbon (black and white as carbon edition physical version). Pop-ups are less obtrusive and pieces no longer float, now are sustained on a wooden table.- Artificial intelligence. It has been improved both in their deciciones as in the time it takes. It is still slow in higher difficulties.- Missing pieces. The missing pieces are sold as DLC.- It is not DRM-free. No, it's not. It is advertised as such but to play online you need Steam. You can copy the program files but only work to play without internet connection.Edit: Since I wrote this review, there was an update that fixes some online problems (some of which I was a victim). I didn't test it yet.			"

												Genre - Board Game ConversionThis is a 2 player game that can be played against adjustable difficulty AI, Hot Seat or Online, this covers all bases unless aliens exist or we can some how get monkeys invoilved. It is a game that MENSA backed and I can see why. It has the mechanics to make each game a quick strategic test, the more moves you think ahead the more chance you have to win. Each bug moves differently (like chess) and the aim is to suround the enemy queen. They have included many achievements for those who are interested and different bugs have been added to allow customised games and re-playability.			"

												This game is like the original board game in play. You can enjoy the same tightly woven gameplay as the original anywhere you can connect to the internet, and to boot it's cheaper than the boardgame also. Pretty easy to learn, but to become a real master might take more time for those who are challenged by strategy games like chess. Find a friend who likes this style of game and get all those achievements!			"

												Hive is a fantastic game, and this is a pretty good implementation. However, there is some minor wonkiness with the interface: 1. You can't pan around because it really isn't necessary, but this causes an effect with some tile placements where you have to find the portion of the tile at the top which isnn't being obscured by other text.2. There are announcements that are displayed when a move repeats a previous hive configuration that are very distracting and practically useless because they obscure the playfield.3. The developers used this 3D zoom-out display mechanic that automatically scales the playfield to hold the tile configuration, even when there is only one huge tile on the playfield at the very beginning of the game.Despite these minor problems, the game is very enjoyable and is the perfect distraction for ten minutes between other activities.

												I can't really do an unbiased review, but I will say that I think that this is by far the best game I've been involved in making, up to this point! :) - and no, it's not my first game. :PI'm really happy with how fun the Steam features are, although I'm a bit surprised how few people have gotten the Barrel Roll achievement ;)We've had a blast adding more and more features over the last few months since launch. At the time of this writing, there have been at least 9 notable updates since the launch 4.5 months ago: http://steamcommunity.com/app/251210/announcementsWhile we're supporting Hive we've already begun work on our next game, Khet 2.0.  The exciting part is that all of our board games are likely to be built on the same engine we've written... so any new features we add into Khet will likely result in another upgrade to Hive! ...for instance, this week I've been working on teaching the AI to think during the opponent's turn.  If that works out, it should be in the next Hive update, also.We have a bunch of fun stuff planned for Hive in the future. Our only limitation seems to be the 24 hour day... but over time, you should see more and more of the cool ideas we have in our head!			"

Should You Buy This Game?The game succeeds in allowing you to play the strategy board game Hive on Steam utilizing different match parameters including local/online coop and solo play with various difficulty levels. It's pretty rare to see PC versions of board games on Steam with a solid AI. If you like strategy board games at all, I definitely recommend getting this game. If you want to add another layer of depth and difficulty to the game, get the amazing DLC.GameplayRulesHive is a Mensa Select award winning board game, and this Steam game with the same name manages to bring the tabletop fun to a virtual platform. For those that have never played Hive before, your objective is to surround the opponent's ""Queen"" with your various ""Insect"" pieces. Each ""Insect"" has a particular moveset, similar to Chess pieces, that will force you to really think hard about where to move your bugs. The board is created using the ""Insect"" tiles you place.Game ModesFrom the same developers that brought Reversi to Steam, similar game options are present. You have the ability to: play against AI with multiple difficulty levels, pass and play for local coop, or play online against other users. The online feature provides a game browser with custom matches including ranked play. You even have the ability to utilize asynchronous play - you can quit the game and receive a notification when it's your turn. The online community seems to be present, with a decent amount of open games observed on the online browser.AI DifficultyRegarding solo play, the AI is moderately difficult on Queen and above difficulty levels (Brood < Drone < Worker < Queen < Hive Mind). Even though the DLC ""Insects"" greatly enhance the depth of Hive, the base game is already robust enough for complex matches. I am glad the game shows you possible move locations as the rules can get a little tricky to keep track of. DLCThe Pillbug, Ladybug, and Mosquito expansions add three new ""Insects"" with new and unique abilities. The Pillbug is the only method to directly move an opponent's piece, and also has the ability to lock the opponent from moving that piece in the next turn. The Mosquito inherits abilities of any piece it touches, while the Ladybug combines the movement of the Beetle and Spider pieces. From this description alone, it should be easy to imagine how these DLC ""Insects"" will change your gameplay.You have the ability to activate each expansion separately, in case there is an ""Insect"" that you don't like playing with. Unfortunately, the game only allows one piece of each DLC ""Insect"" to play with if enabled. Allowing the ability to modify the quantity of each piece, adding more personalization options/improved graphics and upgrading the UI are the only suggestions I can think of in order to improve this game.

												This is an awesome game. The original tabletop/boardgame was designed by John Yianni in 2001 and for me it's an modern classic. The steam version is very pretty and gives you the tabletop expirience and has some  nce visual features to help you play like highlighting your possible moves for the selected piece. Other features are pass and play, async online play and five AI settings.If you like boardgames and want a quick, easy to learn but hard to master strategygame  i can recommend this.I also recommend you get a copy of the boardgame. It is very portable and you can play it anywhere with a friend, a little space and about 5-15 min. time.			"

												It took me a little while to get the hang of this game and learn the ropes. I definitely should've paid more attention to what each piece can do and not tried right off the bat to beat the hardest difficulty. When I lowered the difficulty back to normal, I was able to win several games and explore several different strategies. I bought the DLCs with it because I got the game on sale and wanted to see how the ladybug, mosquito, and pillbug added to the gameplay and strategical depth. On the surface, it looked relatively simple, but once I got about an hour into it, I saw just how much there is to this game. The object of the game is just to surround your opponent's queen bee piece on all it's sides. To do that, you and your opponent take turns moving or placing different bugs to create the game board (called the hive). There's the army ant, which can move any number of spaces along a straight line. It can't go over any pieces, however. There's also the grasshopper that has to move in a straight line hopping over pieces as it goes. There's a beetle that can climb on top and over any piece. Any piece that it's resting on top of can't move as long as the beetle is on top of it. All the beetles can be stacked on top of each other, too, but I'm not sure that there's any reason to do that. MY favorite is the spider which always moves 3 spaces. It can't go up and over pieces and always has to move 3 spaces. It's one of the trickiest pieces to work with, but extremely satisfying when used successfully. The queen bee always has to be placed by your 4th turn and can only move 1 space at a time-kind of like the king in chess. That's it for the main game's bugs. Together they provide a decent amount a variety to the strategies that can be used, but like I said, I got the DLCs for it, so I also get to use the ladybug, mosquito, and pillbug. Each of them has a special ability that makes them uniquely powerful for certain situations. The mosquito can be the most powerful piece in the game and the weakest. Alone, it has no ability to move, but it's special ability is that it can copy the movement abilities of any piece that it is touching. And yes, that means, the more pieces, the more abilities. The ladybug is a little strange. It can move on top of the hive (other pieces on the game board) for 2 spaces, but then it has to come back down. It's extremely useful in certain situations. And lastly is the pillbug. It's the piece I've used the least in the game so far, but it can be a real life saver. It moves like the queen (only 1 space at a time) but it has the unique ability to be able to move any piece that touches it-regardless of whether it's yours or the enemy's. It can only move one piece a turn, but still, if used correctly, like I said, it can be a live saver.			"

												This is a very fun game.  I never played the physical version.  I just came across this on sale and bought a two pack for myself and a co worker to try it.  We played a few times and then I bought another 2 pack for the other guys in the office.  Fun game.As a program it works well.  The controls are easy.  Not clunky at all.  I love that you can take days between turns.  Not that we have had to do that, but our job is such that we can't just sit and look at the game board.  Being able to walk away for 30 minutes or an hour...etc., and not miss your turn is a great option.  Perfect game to have in the background and just take your turn whenever you get the chance.The original tileset provides a good game and then the DLC just expands it that much more.Definitely worth it for board game fans, and strategy fans.  Fun to play with others on different computers in the same room.  Probably fun with random stangers online, although I haven't done that yet.			"

												Not sure if you will like this game? Just answer these questions:-Do you like Chess?-Do you want to play Chess with different rules?-Do you want to play Chess on an open board?If you answered ""Yes"" to all then this game is for you.Basically, Hive is an open minded Chess game. The strategy feels simular, yet different, and possibly more challenging. You get to choose what pieces you want to play and how to play them. You can play agressive or defencive, based on your set up. This being said, I think most people who like Chess will like Hive.The one drawback I have so far is that to play online you have to sign up with an account not connected to steam. So I've only played against the AI. They have been challenging enough for me and enjoyable. However, I've only put 2.5 hours into the game and have beaten the hardest level AI. You can play against friends locally with just one copy of the game as well so that's a huge plus! Hopefully this helps! "

												Nice game. Like the graphics and the overall idea. Not played the board game although I am a particular board / card game fan (old school and computerised versions) This reminds me (for those of you who haven't played the board game already) of a cross between chess and drafts. Mainly chess. There are quite a few moves to remember and will take a while to become proficient. However, the game highlights the areas which each peice can move to. I have only played in the ""novice"" mode so far so I don't know if this continues through the levels or indeed via online options. ( only played the computer who was very kind at that level and I won LOL It could have beat me at least five moves before I eventually worked out some stratergy) I have purchased the full expantions which make the game more interesting too which I am pleased I did. I have bought it for my partner and am looking forward to playing via the net in a private game. There is also a lobby where you can pit against others which is a good option for any type of board / card game :)So; Like the graphics      Like the concept      So far 10/10 will update if I change my mind after more game play but very plesaed so far			"

												I bought this game because I have really been getting into the abstract strategy genre of board games recently. I'd heard mixed reviews from many sources about this game, so I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. I LOVE it. It's very well-designed and fun to play. It's like chess in a lot of ways, but it's more than a chess variant. I highly recommend this game!			"

												Nice game. Like the graphics and the overall idea. Not played the board game although I am a particular board / card game fan (old school and computerised versions) This reminds me (for those of you who haven't played the board game already) of a cross between chess and drafts. Mainly chess. There are quite a few moves to remember and will take a while to become proficient. However, the game highlights the areas which each peice can move to. I have only played in the ""novice"" mode so far so I don't know if this continues through the levels or indeed via online options. ( only played the computer who was very kind at that level and I won LOL It could have beat me at least five moves before I eventually worked out some stratergy) I have purchased the full expantions which make the game more interesting too which I am pleased I did. I have bought it for my partner and am looking forward to playing via the net in a private game. There is also a lobby where you can pit against others which is a good option for any type of board / card game :)So; Like the graphics      Like the concept      So far 10/10 will update if I change my mind after more game play but very plesaed so far			"

												Hive is a good digital translation of the table-top tile game for 2 players.  This version seems to be a direct port of the mobile platform, and while I've not had issues with gameplay, it did freeze when I went to look at the extras.  Not a big deal.  Well-designed in terms of how the various pieces interact, and their distributions.  Personally, I think the game isn't fully realized without the DLC, and those pieces should have been included with the basic game, otherwise your limited options will often leave you playing to a draw.  The AI doesn't start to get difficult until you set it to Hive Mind, but that might just be from my own familiarity with the physical game.  I gifted a copy to a friend in case we ever want to play, but otherwise I don't envision myself playing online much.  Recommended at full price for fans of abstract strategy games.  Hive's hex tiles and spatial fluidity are a nice change from other games in this genre.			"

The interface is quite and gives you the views and feeling you get while playing the bord game.

												A favourite abstract tabletop game, the Windows implementation of Hive is a brain-burner that can be played in as little as five minutes while still providing a strong strategic gaming experience similar to Chess.This isn't the first implementation of Hive for the screen, including iOS and Android versions. The iOS version is fairly well-done, but the Android version left something to be desired. In comparing both to this version, this version comes out dominating, not simply because of the extra features and ease of implementing a Windows game, but also for a well-designed, slick game and interface.The game is best suited to board gamers, particularly fans of abstract games. The addition of the Mosquito, Ladybug and Pillbug expansions makes for an even nicer gaming experience. Having the option to play vanilla Hive or with any number of the expansions turned on makes for a great game to have in any abstract fan's collection.Play online or against the AI, which has a range of skill levels from the incredibly random to the master Hive player.Worth checking out.

												Hive is an abstract, innovative game in which the pieces are the game board (the 'hive'). Each piece is one of a variety of insects, and each has its own rules governing how it may move in play. The rules are simple, but play is deep; there are infinite board configurations. It's somewhat chess-like in that respect.There's single player and multiplayer. With many games the multiplayer depends upon who else wants to play at the time, but If you can't find someone to play when you hop on, you can go to 'Create Game', make a non-private game, click 'Ready' then 'Start Alone', ESCape and 'leave game' -- and your game will wait around for somebody to join it, even if you're not online :)This incarnation of Hive (the best ones are real world copies you can take to the pub!) is charming. The pieces make cute chirping noises when they move... the background music is a little repetitive (but if you turn it off, after a while I think you'll miss it).Definitely worth the investment.			"

												Complicated enough for mensa with convoluted thinking in layers (some critters can even crawl on top).  Simple enough for a preschooler to play, without so much strategy barring the fun of just moving bugs around on a screen, and winning occasionally.  I suggest that you look at the various movements as an overview and just play to get the feel for what the different bugs can do.  The complicated sounding movement rules almost kept me away from enjoying the game.  After just playing anyhow, it's much simpler to follow.			"

Many of the stalemates resemble Go stalemates (ko situations), much of the early piece selection is much more reminiscent of Chess early game.I absolutely recommend this game for anyone who loves to learn the rules of a game in 20 minutes, and then be constantly surprised and fascinated in how a game can turn out for many hours to come.

It's great fun.  You can play it fast or very slow and methodically.  The thing that is interesting about the game is that the design space is very very big.  Or put another way each game you play will be quite unlike the last one if at least one of you tries something different.  There is a huge amount of variability of strategy in the plays I've had.  Being able to play with friends around the world while chatting via skype makes the game indespensible for me.  Highly recommended.			"

On my desktop, the game would start, would show up in Task Manager processes, would show as Running in Steam, but there was no Game UI/window or icon button on the Task Bar by which to get to the window.  On my laptop, I got a memory corruption error.  Unless something changes in the next 10 minutes, I'm getting a refund.New News as of 9/27/2016: Not sure what changed, between Steam, Win10, or the game or some combination, but the game now works! :)  Thanks to Sean (one of the developers) for working with me initially to try to debug the problem.  Wish we knew what has changed and fixed the problem, but I'm just OK with it working now. :)~Bruce			"

I didn't play it much, but basically the game is : try to prevent your opponent to move his pieces while moving your pieces yourself. It leads to very blocked situations very fast with very little choices, and the 5 games I played looked very similar to each other.This review seems pretty accurate of my experience http://steamcommunity.com/id/BosozokuKane/recommended/251210/ , but it has been heavily down-voted, so maybe I'm missing something.

I really can't even beleive they are charging money for this. The AI is shockingly horrible. There is literally no difference between the top three difficulty levels. None. The computer makes numerous mistakes and obvious misplays.Don't worry, at least there's multiplayer right? No. There isn't. It looks like there is, but nobody plays. Most likely because the matchmaking system looks awful and most likely doesn't work. There is no way to chat in the lobby. There are literally no games...ever. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME HOPING TO PLAY ONLINE WITH RANDOMS, IT WON'T HAPPEN.I feel cheated. I can't believe I paid money for this. This should be an early access beta but instead they are charging full retail.All I can say is absolutely do not buy this game. It isn't finished. The AI is elementary. And there is no multiplayer. For all intensive purposes this game doesn't work!			"

												Hive is fantastic and addictive board game that has a ton of replay value. The gist of it is that each turn, players can either place a hexagonal piece on the playfield, or move a piece that is already placed. Each piece represents a different bug, and each type of bugs has different rules of movement. The goal is to surround the other player's queen bee. Like any truly great board game, the ruleset is easy to learn, but hard to master. This game has that ""just one more game"" quality to it, where if you lose, you've got to play another round because you're just so close to beating it. The ai is fantastic and does a good job of scaling to the various difficulty levels. I really enjoy this game and it seems like the developers are adding more to it. The DLC pieces are well worth getting as well, as they add some great mechanics to the game. Overall, this is a must-have for fans of board games on Steam.			"

												The original ""board"" game is really cool. Totally worth getting if you have people to play physical games with.This computer implementation is acceptable, although even the hardest AI isn't really hard enough.You can play multiplayer, either locally or online, and games are kept active when you sign out so you can play over many days. You're informed via steam when your opponent has moved.Unfortunately, there is a little bit of DLC. It's probably best to buy the complete set as most online games are played on that version. (Update) the new (and official) pieces (in the DLC) are a positive addition to the game mechanics IMHO.Board game: 98/100.Steam version: 67/100.			"

												[EDIT 6/21: I'm finding the multiplayer community to be extremely small. Wait time for an online game is usually upwards of 20 minutes. It's best to get this game if you already kind of have someone you're going to play it with.]The boardgame version is an instant classic, and so I got really excited once I saw it on Steam. My brother and I love the game, so I picked up a 2-pack and sent him a copy. Thanks, steam sale!For those of you who haven't played it before, think of this as a fast-paced version of Chess based on insects. Instead of your pieces arrayed on the board, you actually create the board as you lay pieces down one by one and move them around. Very fluid. A typical game will only take you around 5 minutes, though, not 5 hours. The base game is fun, though the expansion DLC is a must-buy to enjoy the game's full potential.My main concern was with how the game would look and play, especially since it's a port. The trailer left a bit to be desired.First impressions after a half hour of play:- Visuals are crisp and fluid, much better than you'd think from viewing the trailer.- Music gets old, fast.- AI is good enough to give you a challenge, especially if you're new to the game or just kind of rusty. I've busted through the first 3 tiers of AI in about 30 minutes.- Love having the ability to change the visual style of the pieces. Charcoal (the grayscale) is my favorite. Wasn't too keen on the '3D' style. A little disappointed that there isn't any way to visually customize the, er, 'table' that you're playing on, but this is a tiny gripe at best.- Multiplayer seems ... functional? I guess? There were only 3 people on when I tried, all of whom I guess were AFK, so couldn't test it. There is an online mode though so that makes me happy. There's also hotseat for those who want that.- Multiplayer lobby lacks a chat function. That sucks. I've had to deal with the same problem in other games, though, especially with XBox ports. Form a steam group, I guess -_-All and all it's a faithful representation of the game with only very minor drawbacks, and well worth the money. A 2-pack with all DLC is going for 11 bucks right now for the summer sale.			"

												Fun game and an interesting aspect is the more extra pieces you have, the easier it is to win.   My only con for the developers are that the harder the AI becomes the slower (dog slow on highest level) the game becomes.   I suspect this because the AI difficulty is looping through every possible move to determine how to beat the user versus a more advance AI algorithm.   Great game though, fun and original!			"

												The original Hive is a great game, destined to be a classic like Checkers, or Chess. The Steam version looks good, but I initially had some problems with it.-When playing with extra pieces online, the game will sometimes lock up when a player uses one of the ""extra"" pieces like the Mosquito. After contacting Blue Line, I was told that it could be an issue with my virus scanner (Total Defense), and it was. -One time, the computer assumed that I had no moves to make. This gave the computer unlimited moves to surround my Queen. This only happened once, and it's possible that the game was correct. Unfortunately, the computer resolved the turn so fast that I couldn't see what happened.-It is not made clear that the play area can be rotated for a better view of the pieces. When pieces get stacked, it's possible to block the view of adjacent pieces on the far side of the camera.Besides the above issues, this version is very polished. It has online play, hotseat play, different displays, and different levels of difficulty for the AI. I hope Blue Line fixes the above issues, and creates new computer versions of awesome board games.			"

												The boardgame it self is good. It is simple but sophisticated.But the video game is totally an unfinished product, it's not worth the whole price. And don't expect multiplayer because nobody plays it. If you want to play with your friend in hotseat, that's ok, but don't buy it for the whole price, it's too expensive for the simplicity and the lack of polish of this game.			"

												Think chess is complicated?  Not compared to this.Think chess is abstract?  Not compared to this.Think chess is boring?  Not compared to this.Think it's hard to convince a friend to play chess with you on the computer?  Not compared to this.I've played it mostly offline, and the achievements do not post unless you earn them while connected.  I tried to play a quick match online but there wasn't anyone online to match me against (I wasn't surprised).Playing versus the computer all except for one of my pieces was locked down unable to move, leaving little choice in what to do.The graphics and music are awful, just look at that wood grain.  I'd recommend the physical game over this rendition, unless you are looking for a cheap cure for your insomnia.			"

												The concept is interesting and the game is balanced.  I am no expert at this game, but I would not equate this game to either Chess or Go.  There is simply not enough gameplay and depth to the game.  In Chess and Go, there is much more to both strategy and tactics, while here there is very little. The games move through stages of strategy and tactics so quickly that there is really little time to develop strategy during the game itself.  There is no room for any kind of intuitive game play, like the early stage in go, either.  I think once you learn the rules of the pieces well, you will probably do well in this game.Overall, I say the concept is interesting, but something is missing from the game to add real strategy and increased depth to the tactical side.  If you enjoy a higher paced version of chess with fewer pieces and quicker results, this might be good for you.  I enjoy the depth of Go much more and the give and take of the game.Also, as others have said, the online community does not exist.  So, it is best not to count on getting an online match.			"

You might like if: You really enjoy the likes of chess, Mahjong or solitaire on the PC and want a quirkier game to try your hand at.Mensa Shmensa... Is this game fun to play?Answer: Kind of, but it's a pretty basic implementation. It's a digital version of the game with a basic UI... that's it.The game board itself cleanly presented with an elegant, yet striking, design. Animations are clean and the possible moves being highlighted is an excellent touch (especially for spiders). Any illegal move is also explained to the player, so it's nicely intuitive. However, the menu and UI is poor, there's little music / atmosphere and, unlike the likes of Chessmaster, there's nothing else in-game to teach tactics, suggest moves or the equivalent of ""2 moves to checkmate"" style puzzles... So it really depends what you expect from it. If you literally just want a means to play the game against the AI or another player (local or otherwise), this should suffice. Anything else, and it might feel a little bare.As for Hive itself, the game plugs the ""more complex than Chess"" spiel as it mathematically has more possible moves... But if I was to rearrange my eyebrow hairs, that would mathematically have even more possible combinations ... so buy my eyebrows*. Mathematical complexity doesn't necessarily make it more fun or strategic. What it is, however, is a clever little tactical duel that can generally last about 5-10 mins (if that). Whilst it doesn't have the same drawn out development or range that chess does; it's punchy, the bug types are interesting and the fact that the game board is dynamically built by the pieces themselves is a nice twist. But where many pieces quickly get pinned, it can equally make the game a bit frustratingly fiddly (and limited) at times.What you ultimately get is a quick filler with tactical depth... but that's about it. If you're not looking for anything fancy though (i.e. are guilty of clicking many hours away on Solitaire) and want something with a lot more bite, this could well be worth a shot. Just note though that the game is missing 3 pieces, which are sold individually as DLC.*Please don't. I like them			"
