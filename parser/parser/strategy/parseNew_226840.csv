												This game is absolutely incredible. It stays true to the style and feel of the previous games in the series, while also embracing some of the more modern elements in the 4X genre. Some may find the game a bit ""simplistic"" compared to other 4x games, but this is misleading. While this game is very easy to learn, and keeps most of the numbers and math pretty simple, there is an incredible amount of strategic depth to this game, and even after over 500 hours played, with 90% of that focusing on just *one* class, I am still learning new things.The game itself takes place on about 3 different levels. The most prominent level is the tactical combat itself. This is unmatched by any other game in the 4x genre. In truth, it's more akin to the Total War series than anything, except turn based. It is not an understatement to say that this is the best combat system in any of the modern 4x games, bar none.The second level is strategic movement. Many reviewers and players alike who only play this game for a bit do not understand just how much thought goes into something as simple as moving troops around. Each hex has different movement costs, which affects how fast units can move across them. But the movement costs are variable based on race, unit type itself, and even what the player has researched. Furthermore, different types of units may benefit from terrain features, such as Druids and Rogues who have units with Concealment. This allows some of their units to be rendered invisible in forest tiles. Compounding this issue is how classes and races interact. For instance, Dwarven Rogues are the only combination in the game with access to mountain concealment from the beginning, and this allows for some rather unique strategies involving raiding parties in the early game. While many will say that the tactical combat in this game is what stands out, at the intermediate skill level, the strategic level may actually be more important. After all, you can't actually GET to tactical combat if your enemy utilizes terrain to outrun you, or to reach your cities before your main army can get there to repel them.The third layer is the empire management layer. This layer is pretty much what your typical 4x player expects to be the bulk of the game, as games like Civ largely ignore the first 2 to focus entirely on management. To those who have played and enjoyed the Civilization series: be warned. Age of Wonders 3 handles city management *vastly* differently than most other 4x games. The key difference lies in how cities work. Unlike civilization, there are no wonders or structures that can be built in cities to give them a specialized role. But don't worry, there absolutely are ways to make cities unique. Where this game differs from most others is that cities are largely defined by the terrain features within their domain. This creates a very different feel to empire management than other 4x games, in that the single most important factor of a city lies in where it is placed. In fact, a city placed on the right structure can often unlock units that cannot be accessed normally, or allow unusual and powerful modifiers to your armies. Some even give massive bonuses to income, or research.While each layer is important, it is worth noting that this game is still very much different from many other 4x games. The focus is of the game is, at its heart, a wargame. While the diplomacy is functional, the predominant strategy will always be to crush your enemies, and annex their cities. Make no mistake, though. Although the goal is the same in every game, the methods are as variable as your imagination.I'm not exaggerating when I say that there are players in the multiplayer community who have reputations for using an iconic style or strategy, that is almost entirely their own. The sheer number of options in character creation means that a player could very well run a strategy that is truly unique.So if you're looking for a fantasy 4x wargame, you will not find a better one out there. Age of Wonders 3 is simply the best at what it does.			"

												Review based off of playing the Closed Beta. (Which is voluntary, and invites were sent based off of forum participation.)I like TBS games, generally ones with interesting combat systems, and the last one I genuinely liked was XCOM. I've spent the past years lamenting every TBS game that came out, because of the combat systems that resolve the battle in damage exchanges on the World Map. So I was excited about Fallen Enchantress, and I played it for a while, but it had no multiplayer which inevitably killed it for me.So, I was overjoyed to hear that Age of Wonders was returning with all the Tactical Combat and multiplayer features that I so loved. I've played each of the games in the series, I thought that AoW1 was excellent, AoW2 was abysmal and Shadow Magic was great. For whatever reason, I actually expected to be disappointed by this entry and was considering not buying it. After playing the beta, I can see that my initial instincts were unfounded.There are obvious graphical improvements, and I can't really fault them, beyond what I feel is an issue with the change to lower tier unit parties. Though each of the models is well detailed, because they are stood together in a tight stack I feel the units lose a bit of their definition, this might be because of the level at which I zoom out to, but at the end of the day I need to do that to see a practical amount of the battle.I think the time it takes to enact tactical combat is good, there are speed settings to allow you to increase unit movement and attacks if you're in a hurry, and I generally am. The game ran smooth for the most part, and my biggest issue, which is fairly minor, with the combat is that the hitting animations don't feel particularly visceral in terms of sound, graphical action and reaction. (Some do, but for the T1/T2 melee clashes I didn't feel it was as brutal as the earlier games.)I prefer the combat system to any TBS that I have played in the past years, and it allows for larger scale battles as well in beautiful settings. (When I compare it to HoMM, which I dislike, or XCOM's, which I loved, or Civ's, which I found boring as I'm sure I would Warlock, etc.)Each of your Heroes/Leaders has access to a number of upgrades when they level up, leveling up is fairly easy and painless compared to the earlier games (where you had to get the final hit to get the exp) so your heroes become quite strong, quite quickly, but still steps below higher tier units until they reach higher levels. Each hero has it's own class, which grants it access to class specific upgrades, but they all share access to basic upgrades to upgrade stats like Defense, Attack etc. which are fairly straight forward. Each Hero can become a spell caster, and each class has its own subset of spells, though only one spell can be cast a turn (regardless of how many spell casts you have in a battle) which prevents the issue of your army getting instantly destroyed by a barrage of spells in the first round. Your heroes have items slots, and you can get items from exploring dungeons etc. You can also make your own items if your city is advanced enough. I felt that there the items available were interesting, particularly the range of mounts (which unlike other gear displays graphically) that allow you to fly about, in the case of wyverns or manticores, and offer other abilities.I thought the leveling system for heroes was quite good, I found myself often upgrading the default stats and I didn't feel that there was much variation between each hero class type, though there were some cool melee orientated abilities for the Warlord and some interesting ones for the Theocrat, as well as the Rogue. A lot of abilities amounted to global damage reduction to your party, and so the differences amounted to a change in damage type.The class you choose for your leader (which has its own levelling/point allocations and is quite similar to a hero) will determine what research/units you will have available to you through the game, as well as three sub-specialitions you can choose when creating your hero which can give you access to new schools of magic, or more practical exploratory/empire building skills. In that regard I thought that there was a good variation of research/summons/units across the six classes and the sub-specializations added extra replayability/variation to that.Unfortunately, I haven't had time to play the multiplayer. I thought that one of the campaigns was excellent, and that one of them was good, I had some issues with it, but I expect those will be resolved before release. Both of the campaigns were a cut above any TBS campaign I've played in the past, featured interesting protagonists, solid writing, and excellent voice acting.Each campaign has a text, voice-acted prologue, and an epilogue for each mission, and throughout each mission there are text pop-outs for dialogue from your enemies and allies. In both campaigns there is a branching point where you have to choose sides so I believe that would result in at least four different endings, though I'm not sure.Either way, there should be a good amount of replayability and entertainment value from the campaigns, and I'm sure that there will be more to come (both from the developers, and users using the editor), and the excellent mechanics of the games themselves (combat, beautiful world design, variety of units and strategies) will add to the enjoyment of those campaigns. There are currently six races, each has different benefits/negatives to its racial units, there are some instances where lower tier units are quite similar, but I think that's to be expected. Overall, I thought there was a good range of units available and that each of the races/class combinations offered a good variety of choice. Across the campaign you play multiple leaders (races/classes) though your main character always sticks with you, either as the leader or as an accompanying hero.I would recommend the game simply for playing the campaign, or for playing the scenarios available or using the random map generator. If you enjoy TBS games then you'll probably like this one, and it should provide you with hours of entertainment. I intend to play the multiplayer when it comes out, and I imagine it's going to be fun, but as I haven't played it I can't really say for sure. "

AGE OF WONDERS III - Good Turn based tactical combat, Hero RPG elements and Empire building 4X strategy  || 8 || Score Comment   Graphics 8 Nice graphics and detail on the strategic map and even better graphics for units, terrain and magical effects in combat. UI is nice, detailed and easy to use  Audio 6 Music gets a little repetitive - maybe a little more variety needed, sound effects are good but nothing special. Gameplay 8 Age of Wonders III is a turn based, 4X strategy game based in a fantasy setting. The tactical combat view (when your army's battle) is excellent, you really feel like you are head to head with the AI (which seems to do a good job most of the time) in a battle of wits. Casting a well timed spell or outmanoeuvring your enemy can sometimes turn the tide of a battle, unfortunately usually the outcome of a battle is a forgone conclusion due to the relative strength of the units involved, but even when this is the case its still fun to crush your enemy and minimise your losses. The strength of the Units in your army really plays such a large part of the battles that you can actually choose to skip the tactical battle entirely and have the computer automatically calculate the results. Some of the units have somewhat of a balance issue with the higher level units often being able to take down whole armies by themselves with little damage or risk. This inevitably results in a race to upgrade your city buildings to create these higher level creatures. AI at the strategic level is a little predictable but there is still fun to be had placing your cities and grabbing as many resources as possible to fund your economy. One thing I noticed at the strategic level is there doesn't seem to be any downside to city spamming (covering the map in loads of your cities) as you gain resources (mana, gold, research) for each city. Ruins, shrines and artefacts are scattered throughout the maps and these will often require you to fight a monster to claim the reward for your Hero. Hero's are your army leaders you get a main one and then can hire more for gold. Hero's have a selection of spells they can use to aid you in battle, summon monsters or benefit your cities. Items you collect / make can be given to your hero's to increase their stats and they also get skills as they earn xp through battles.   Story 7 The game contains a number of well written scenario's which are fairly fun to play through. Overall I think I preferred playing the random maps though.   Replayability 7 If you enjoy the game you will probably want to play it again, random maps and steam workshop adds more community made content.   Overall 8 A fan of this genre will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. While not as complex or detailed as others of the same type what it does it does well. Hotseat mode (a mode I loved from Civilisation) is a great addition to this game and playing with friends is a lot of fun. More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

												Finally the perfect game to scratch my TBS/4X itch! I have a feeling that in 15 years or so I will still be playing Age of Wonders 3. I make this prediction because once in a while I still  play the original AoW and it came out in 1999. So unless they come out with an AoW4 or standalone expansion that is even better in every aspect I think this game will stay on my computer and my next computer and the VR headset after... a long time.My favorite part of AoW3 is its focus on tactical combat while still including all the 4 Xs (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) plus RPG elements. There are cities to form into an empire, heroes to level up, spells to research, dungeons to loot, resources to manage, etc... On top of it all players are engaged in battles early and often. The battles are killer fun tactical experiences that take place on their own maps separate from the primary strategy map. When a hex is attacked on the strategy map the armies/stacks in that hex and all neighboring hexes get pulled into the tactical battle. This means there could be 42 units (7 hexes x 6 units/hex) in the same battle and they could even belong to several different players! The combat mechanics like attacks of opportunity, flanking, guarding, and 3 action points to use for movement, multiple attacks, or multiple reactions are very well done. When playing single player I almost always choose to fight each battle manually because they are so much fun, but there is an option to automatically resolve them if you wish.The only bad thing I can say about AoW3 is that it feels like the morale systems need to be flushed out a little more. My wish for morale is that your starting/ruling race should have more influence on the morale of your cities and units and diplomatic relations with independent cities. It was important in past AoW games. These things will probably get improved with some patches, and should not stop anyone from buying the game.There was a period of years where I played a lot of Civ4 and some Civ5. Eventually I found myself thinking - I wish there was more action in these games and battles were more realistic like... Age of Wonders. Before AoW3 was announced, I searched for recent games with gameplay similar to AoW but nothing seemed to be on the same level. Warlock was too simple and too Civ-y... Total War just didn't draw me in... Others didn't even look worth buying. Age of Wonders seems to fill a special niche that no others do.edit: Forgot to mention one of the things that makes AoW games so replayable - the races. Past AoW games had at least 12 races, but AoW3 is releasing with 6 which is a little disappointing at first glance. However, this is made up by the new class system which did not exist in previous AoW games. The developers have done an amazing job making both race and class matter. An elven archdruid feels different than a draconian archdruid or an elven warlord. Thus, instead of having simply 12 races to choose from you have 36 race/class combos (6 races x 6 classes). There are also specializations/spheres that further customize your leader and playing experience, similar to previous AoW games. I expect more races to be added in DLC or an expansion and am fine with that.			"

												Although Age of Wonders III features story based campaigns and scenarios (many of which are obviously balanced for multi-player), the real meat of the game IMO is the Random Map mode. This is equivalent to the default mode of most 4X games like Civilization, and that's what I'll talk about here.Unlike most 4X games which start you off with a single settler in a mostly empty undeveloped world, the default mode (normal game flow) of AoW3 starts you off in a populated world which already has roads, cities and armies. In these games you can get stuck into the action quickly and may not need to build any cities at all, just capture existing ones. These games can be a lot quicker to play than other 4X games.However, the random map games are extremely customisable, much more than Civ. There are three other preset modes - Battle, Empire Building and Adventure - which provide very different game experiences. Better still, go into the advanced setup screens and you can tweak the details to your heart's content. You can start with nothing more than a settler and a leader in a completely empty world, just like Civ, if that's what you want, or you can fill it with as much or as little of the different options that are available. You can also tweak the geography, altering the quantities of different terrain types that will appear on the map.The graphics are superb, they blow away the old AoW games and are better than most current 4X games IMO. The music is excellent too, one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a game, making it well worth getting the Deluxe version for the 2 hours of music, not to mention the huge 8 player scenario Dragon's Throne.The huge variety of units in the game, and the many different unit abilities and spells, provide for an awesome variety of strategy and tactics. The game is far more detailed than previous versions, and while the older games were great in their own right, AoW3 takes it to a whole new level. I can't go back to the old games anymore. It's a game you can get sucked into for many, many hours of your life.The two expansion packs - Golden Realms and Eternal Lords - are real expansions, not shallow cash grabbing DLCs like in many games these days. They add a lot of real content, not just new races and campaigns, but many new rules and game mechanics.I highly recommend this game, one of the best 4X games ever in my opinion.			"

												It's difficult to follow up a classic. It always feels like something is lost when a great game from years ago is brought into the modern age. Things get prettier, bigger, and more streamlined, but many times it feels like some essential chemistry is lost. Some of us blame nostalgia, others simply write the developers off as appealing to the largest audience or the lowest common denominator. Sequels always lose something.Which is why Triumph Studios had no right to produce such a perfect game.This is the perfect sparkling bouquet of what made the original great, combined with the streamlined production quality we've come to expect from a quality modern game. It's asymmetrical and unfair in the most balanced ways possible. Whether you're outfitting your heroes or designing your player class, you'll find great satisfaction in trying to break the game. You'll be very good at some things, and very bad at others, but it will always make sense and it will always feel right.The unit design deserves special mention. Each unit is deeply well-crafted and unique, even when comparing racial units of the same role. The attention to synergy is unmatched, both between units of the same race and in the way that race and class combine to make a whole. Leveling up often provides interesting new abilities that also tend to synergize, instead of simply providing better stats.This game has a lot of everything, and all of it affects everything else. You'll build cities, research and cast spells, and train units. You'll command armies on the beautiful strategic map, and when you explore dungeons or fight another army, you'll go down to fight on equally beautiful tilesets. Tactical combat is reasonably simple but very deep. This game has not been casualized. The A.I. is maddeningly clever, and you won't take this statement seriously until you've experienced it. You'll fight skirmishes in the woods with bandits, and you'll fight in truly massive sieges to conquer cities. Your heroes will explore dungeons, find and equip items, and lead your armies into battle.You will build your strategy, and then get excited about other strategies you think could work. They probably will. Your race, your class, and your specializations all fundamentally change the way you need to approach the game. It takes a long time to bloom into a full understanding of how the various parts of the game work together, but the journey is pleasant, and you can absorb it by playing.The campaign probably deserves it's own review. It's gloriously cheesy golden-age high fantasy. The campaign follows branching questlines, so you can end up doing different missions. The base game has two campaigns of eight missions. Eight does not sound like a lot but you can easily spend an entire day playing one mission. They're huge. Think of them more like chapters. The expansion packs can add another two campaigns. There are also a number of scenarios which are like competitive missions for X players. The ""real"" Age of Wonders though is in the procedurally generated random map mode, where you can fight other players or the AI. There are a huge number of random features on the maps, such as ""dwellings"" where you can purchase units from a non-player faction like Giants or Pixies. You'll need to play many games before you've seen everything you can find. Also of note, Age of Wonders has an underground map, full of caves, tunnels, and the cities of the Goblins and Dwarves.Triumph is confident enough in the mastery of their game to give the player enormous freedoms to explore how to play. Their own mastery is evident in the careful design of how every element acts together. If you find anything this game does interesting, play it for that reason, but be prepared to fall in love with the rest. This is what a strategy game should be. 10/10			"

												Amazing game! Been having many hours of fun with it. It's well made, intriguing, solid voice acting, deep strategy, and overall a complete and fantastic experience. A solid combination of heroes of might and magic, civilization, fallen enchantress and master of magic, with the best of all of them.Solid recommendation for ANY TBS fan or anyone interrested in giving TBS a try.Edit: The review is based of my closed beta participation.

												It has been almost one-year since release, I've been playing this game constantly for almost the full year.  Incredibly addictive coupled with vast replayability and a veritable smorgasbord of options, units, spells, structures, and game mechanics... and the developers have only expanded on the deep content with Golden Realms and the upcoming release of Eternal Lords.  I am not normally a review-writer or poster but this is hands down the best game of the genre I've ever played, including Master of Magic.Only a few fairly minor issues - mostly having to do with requested features  such as added victory conditions, more customization options, and more gameplay options have been addressed by the developers or are in the process of being addresed.  Kudos to Triumph.  They've certainly earned the name.  A long-time  player of other 4 x games I would enthusiastically recommend this for any fan of the genre.  I definitely encourage anyone on the fence to try it out!			"

												17 Years ago while I was in college and working at Babbages I bought and played Age of Wonders, I still remember a woman coming in asking me if I knew any games like Heroes of M&M 3, it was surprising to me because you did not get many females back in the late 90s(especially middle aged women) who were into strategy gaming, I remember telling her that if she liked Heroes 3 then she would really like Age of Wonders, so she bought it and left with a smile on her face.  A week later she returned and with the same smile on her face she thanked me for recommending Age of Wonders.  I am now around her age, and I still smile like her when playing an Age of Wonders game.  Triumph has staid true to its formula while adding wonderful new content and graphics to the series.  This is not something that you can say often in this age of gaming, especially with most big companies doing everything they can to create or cater to a casual gaming market where product quality comes second to just feeding gamers their new content fix every couple of months.  Thank you Triumph for staying true to your work of art, and thanks to all of the new and old gamers who have bought their products and supported them, I am sure most of us will agree that they deserve every penny and more....

												Great game, I bought all of the DLC for it and have not been disappointed. It basically is like Civ 5 but the combat is played out on a small map when to armies meet. Considering the combat is the whole reason why I dislike Civ 5 this was a big boon for me. The game has a wide vareity of races and leader types to play as and has a ton of replayability becasue of it unfortunatley though the larger game (6 to 8 players) can take forever (40 hours) and by the half way point everyone has the highest level units and are basically just spaming them at each other. The AI is very competent in the fact that they don't stupidly start a war with you just because and the roving enemies or bandit camps can actually become a problem if you are play on a higher difficulty (this is a good thing). Really its a great game for anyone who likes turn based games, it is not as deep as Civ is in certain areas such as culture and technology, but it makes up for it well with balanced and fun combat.

												ADDENDUM THE REALLY VERY LAST (and probably the most important): While I might not recommend the vanilla game (even with all its patched-in improvements), you can still purchase it and all its DLC (which I would, overall, recommend) as part of a bundle that saves you about $10. I personally don't think the Gold Edition upgrade is worth it, but you're still getting a hefty discount on the meaty bits like Golden Realms and Eternal Lords. The rest of this review pertains to vanilla AoWIII. If you like what you read, definitely consider the bundle. Compared to similarly priced titles like Civ V Complete and Endless Legend + DLC, I'd say it's worth it.Let me preface this by saying that AoWIII is a very polished game; it looks quite nice, has few glitches, and it seems like the Devs put a lot of thought and work into this game.However, I cannot recomend it. Why? It's simply not an enjoyable experience for me. Now, don't get me wrong: I've always been fond of TBS games. I loved Civs 3-5, and have played quite a bit of Fallen Enchantress, as well as some Galactic Civilizations. I'm acquainted with the genre, but am by no means an aficionado.So, why don't I enjoy this game? Well, a large part of stems from how narrow your in-game options are. There are plenty of choices between class and race, and those choices feel significant enough, really, but once you actually start playing the game, you realize that there's really only one way to win: expansion and conquest. I knew going in that this game would be more heavily conflict oriented, but to the point where that's the only means of victory? Not exactly what I had in mind, though I can certainly get by with that.But it's not just that you'll have to go to war to win. It's more holistic than that: everything in this game is about conquest. The only real purpose of your cities is to produce soldiers, in some form or fashion. You build buildings to unlock units to fight wars. You conduct research to unlock units to fight wars. You manufacture ""merchandise"" to fund your wars. You ""build housing"" to increase your domain to capture ""resource nodes"" (that only provide a slight buff to production rather than serving as actual resources) to more quickly produce units to...wait for it...fight wars. Now, fighting wars isn't necessarily a bad thing. The combat is very well designed and has a good deal of depth to it, especially when you take into account the racial and class distinctions. But, this generally superior combat seems to come at the cost of the depth of everything else.And that's just the problem: this game lacks depth. There is no real economy management, no real resources to capture (the only two ""currencies"" are gold and mana, the former of which is over abundant and the latter of which is often too scarce), and no real tech tree to navigate. You just plop your identical cities down to increase you GPT to support a bigger army. There's nothing else to it. You don't have to worry about acquiring special resources or developing advanced industry to train particularly powerful units, you just unlock them via research. And you can complete that research very quickly (late game starts at around turn 50 in a standard game, though the overall pacing can be sped up/slowed down during setup). By the time you've done that, you've rendered most every other standard unit in the game obsolete. You can really spam your way to victory against the AI (assuming they're not doing the same; otherwise you just get caught in a gridlock). And so, you lose that depth again.If you love TBS combat, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you're looking for something more well-rounded, consider picking it up on sale. If you're expecting something akin to Civ V, check out GalCiv III (maybe; it's really expensive and still early access).ADDENDUM 1: Since patch 1.093 (I think), pacing has been slightly improved through the addition of new production-related buildings and other changes. However, there have been no major changes made to the other mechanics, so, take it for what you will. Mana has been capped as well, which helps to prevent surpluses. T4 spam is still prevalent, though it occurs about 20 turns later for non-summoning classes.ADDENDUM 2: Since patch 1.12 (or something, I dunno), different races have received different buffs/nerfs, and different gamespeeds have been added. This does indeed help with pacing, and provides more strategic depth to the potentially longer early/mid-game. However, economy and diplomacy are still pitifully simplistic, meaning that my core issues with the game (the near single-minded focus on combat) remain. The late-game is still shallow, even when opponents are on fairly even footing.ADDENDUM 3: A new expansion has been announced, Golden Realms (I guess? Heck if I know.), that adds a new shorter campaign and race. It's Halflings, and it's only three episodes long, compared to Vanilla's 6? So, basically, it's half-sized, just for the Halflings. It's pretty clever. More importantly, (to me, anyway), it's supposed to bring a lot more to the table in regards to empire management, like special, competitive city projects, new, powerful effects for ""special tiles"" like treasure sites, and exclusive racial defensive improvements. A new victory condition has been added, as well. Unsure as to what they'll be doing with diplomacy. Iffy on the price, too. Something to think about, though.ADDENDUM 4: Golden Realms is out and it can be yours for a cool ten dollars. If you're American. Not quite sure about the pricing in other regions, as Steam doesn't do direct conversions. I've played a teensy, tiny amount of the new campaign but, to be honest, I really couldn't get back into it. Diplomacy has been upgraded (for free) as well, as part of patch 2.4 (I never get these right). It's an improvement, but you simply won't see specialized treaties or tech trading a la Fallen Enchantress or Endless Legend. No manipulating multi-national councils, either, even though they exist per in-game lore.ADDENDUM THE LAST: Late to the party, but that Necromancy expac, Eternal Lords, released and, if you're willing to drop whatever they're asking for on it (~$20 up front, less on sale), the game definitely becomes robust enough to where I can call it a worthy 4X title. The new Necromancer class does a good job of shaking things up (as most necro-oriented civs do), and the new races (Tigrans and Frostlings, both returning from previous AoW titles) are surprisingly distinct from each other and the rest of the cast as far as units and aesthetics are concerned. Diplomacy received a hefty overhaul, with the inclusion of a new racial diplomacy system and related victory conditions. Play nice with races and you can construct wonders cementing their allegiance, or somesuch. You also unlock various empire-wide policies in the process, which adds another layer to empire management. It's fairly simple, but the overall concept's a pretty novel approach to diplo.The game's pretty much where I want it to be now, though you have to invest in it to get there. I'd say it's better than Endless Legend + DLC now, but that's just my opinion. I'm leaving the review as ""not recommended"" if only because most of the core problems in the review can only be alleviated with DLC. Unless the modding scene fixed that. Did I mention, they added workshop support. Pretty nifty.			"

What Age of Wonders 3 consists of content wise.6 Fully Playable Factions Humans Dwarves High ElvesDraconiansOrcsGoblins 4 sub factions you encounter in the world and can also control while playing as a main faction to suppliment your forces.DragonsGiantsFeyArchon Revenants 249 unique units all with their own custom visuals and animations depending on raceThese are split between 4 tiers with 4 tiers of ranks every unit can level up to obtain passive stat bonuses and unique abilities. There are 6 unique classes you can choose from in order to determine what specialty your hero leader unit posses which also affects access to unique units only for that class.DreadnoughtTheocratRogueArch DruidSorcererWarlordEach hero class offers different sets of spells you can use in combat and on the strategic maps.104 Combat Spells91 Strategic SpellsLeaders and hero units have an extensive range of passive stat bonuses and abilities players can choose every time they gain a rank. 44 hero leadership passives that affect troops. 29 spells and hero specific passive abilities for the rogue class alone. There are plenty of abilities, passives, and spells for each of the 6 classes to make them widely customizable. Each leader has 8 slots for gear ranging from melee weapons, to cloaks, and even unique mounts they can ride. Weapons and mounts are fully displayed on your character while in-game during combat. There is an additional 10 slots per leader/hero available for ranged weapons and storage. Empire building including city upgrades and other dwellings you'll find located throughout the map24 city upgrades to expand and customize each settlement33 unique dwelling upgrades that allow for custom non faction units such as dragons and undead to suppliment your army. To further customize your facation you have access to a total combination of any 3 different specialization available to any class and any facationCreation AdeptCreation MasterDestruction AdeptDestruction MasterFire AdeptFire MasterEarth AdeptEarth MasterWater AdeptWater MasterAir AdeptAir MasterExpanderExplorer A fully functional leader creatorEmblem option2 tiered color choices13 different categories of visual customizations such as gender, head, hair, skin color, accessory, eyes, hair color, eyebrows, posture, clothing, skin decorations, facial hair, and scene (background environment). Also various static character portrate angels to choose from of your unique character model.Randomized generator option for visuals, class, and/or faction.53 pre-made leaders to choose from What else can I say about this game? You've just read through a ton of in-game content making it one of the greatest turn based combat games out there. So many different ways to customize and play you most likely won't even encounter or use everything available in the game. Even if empire building and diplomacy features are fewer than combat assets there is more than enough to satisfy 4X genre players. The games strenght  is getting out into the world, slaying monsters, finding treasure in dungeons, and crushing rival empires. If you like to send postcards and and have tea parties to talk out your problems with rival warlords, this game might not be for you. If you like to trick rivals into allegencies only to build up your forces while their guard is down then knock over their castle when convenient, this game is for you.Beyond being an absolutely great game with tons of content it's technical side as a PC game is solid. No poor low resolution console port, plenty of game options, and loads key bind customization to be found. Performance is a dream and the game is beautiful whether raiding dungeons relieving dragons of their loot or sacking major cities, and doing so right outside their gates seeing the city itself in all it's 3d model glory on the battlefield.One of the greatest PC games of all time. More factions and content to come via expansions. If you are a 4X fan and like fantasy genre games you cannot pass this one by.			"

												This game really captures the 'just one more turn!'-feeling. It is addicting and the game becomes better with each patch & DLC.Pros: A beautiful strategic map Combat is fast, brutal and entertaining  It is fun to level your Heroes and Leader; it adds RPG to the game. Also quests that can be gained from independent cities or dwellings add to RPG-feel. Concept of Race & Class for your Leader provide much variety in play. For example, you can play as a Orc Sorcerer, Dwarven Warlord, Elven Rogue etc.  Classes are really different from each other; this applies to gameplay, spells and units. See this wiki[age-of-wonders-3.wikia.com] for an overview (click the class name for more info). Nice campaigns with different outcomes A pretty good Random Map generator with tons of options Users make custom scenarios and challenges with Map Editor Great music Triumph Studios listens really well to the community and has fixed (almost) all bugs/issuesCons: In general races could be more varied. The good news is that Triumph is working on this and it is expected to improve in the next patch. See this official dev journal[ageofwonders.com] (nov 2014) --> *EDIT april 2015* - this has been addressed in the latest patch 1.5!! Although the idea behind alignment is nice (good/neutral/evil is based on your actions and not on your race choice), it remains a bit shallow imo.  --> *EDIT april 2015* - this has been addressed mainly in the DLC Eternal Lords! MOD-tools are not released at this moment (nov 2014). They most probably will in the future though.Other comments: For new-comers to the game it can be difficult to learn and to master. It is recommended to watch some videos on YouTube if you are new to the Age of Wonder-series. For example: How to play Age of Wonders 3-videos by iHunterKiller.

Disclaimers:- I was a closed beta tester for the base game as well as its two expansions. However I'm not an employee of Triumph Studios, only a community volunteer. - This review was written post Eternal Lords and 1.5 patch releases. Age of Wonders III is a turn based hex based fantasy 4x game that is a lot more combat focused compared to something like the Civilization series but also quite a bit more strategically and tactically involved than let's say Heroes of Might & Magic which can be both good or bad depending on your personal preferences. GameplayCompared to the previous games AoWIII retains most of the series' fundamentals but also iterates and adds to the formula. The most notable change is the way yor faction is presented via the class system. Your research tree and unit roster are not only determined by spell school and starting race picks but by your leader class (warlords, sorcerer, archdruid, dreadnaught, etc.), starting race as well as specializations which are akin to the previous game's spell spheres and leader skills. Your base unit list is thus determined by the race of the towns you own as well as your chosen class.Comparing it to AoWII the class system in a way separates the racial aspect of a faction from the  gameplay theme of it. For example, in AoW2 Elves were always Druids with nature themed units, Archons were always Theocrats with their religious and holy theme, Dwarves were Dreadnoughts due to their technological prowes, Orcs were Warlords with strong physical combatants and so on. The AoWIII class system separates race and theme so Elves can be steampunk-ish technologists, Dwarves can wield druidic powers while Goblins can be religious crusaders. Thematically this allows you to create both stereotypical combinations (wizard elves) as well as some unusual ones (holy angelic goblins). Gameplay wise the trio of race, class and specialization (additional mini tech trees) allows for a myriad of different play styles and strategies and a very diverse meta game which encourages experimentation and greately enhances replayability.  Each class comes with a unique tech tree which consists of special class units which can have their own racial variations as well as a large number of combat or strategic spells and passive upgrades that enhance your empire as well as units.CustomizationAoWIII features a leader creation process which allows for detailed aesthetic and gameplay customization. Visual options are akin to rpg games like Dragon Age allowing for changes to race, gender, clothing, accessories, hair style and color, skin color,  eyes, hats masks, postures, background scenery, portrait poses, coat of arms, etc.Gameplay-wise the options include race, class and 3 slots for specializations that can be magic oriented or more mundane empire upgrades.Game settings include numerous tweaks to the random map generator like map type (land, continents, islands), map size (s, m, l, xl), geographical settings (types of terrain and climate, existence of the underground layer), starting town/army, amount of resources, treasure sites, independent monsters, etc. Furthermore various game parameters can be tweaked like the number of heroes, hero level cap, hero race, game pace, starting resources, turn progression (classic i-go-you-go or simultanious), empire quests, map events, victory conditions, type and number of opponents, preference for manual or auto-combat and so on.Much effort was made to cater to different preferences and play styles.CombatLike in Heroes of Might & Magic for example, combat in AoWIII happens on a separate tactical map that is derived from the participating units' position on the strategic map. If the units were standing on a snowy arctic hex the tactical map will also have snow on it for example. Same with forests, swamps, etc. Not only that but various sites like cities, farms, dungeons, mines, tombs, etc. are all represented on the tactical map and can have different effects like providing obstacles, choke points, magical effects and so on.Compared to AoWII combat in AoWIII has less randomness and is more dependent on the player making the right moves. Attacks will always hit for example (except under special circumstances) but the damage can still vary and there is the possibility of criticals or fumbles.There are many things to keep an eye on in combat like move points (usually the less you have the less attacks you get but not always), limited retaliations, defensive stances, attacks of opportunity, flanking attacks, distances, unit position and facing, range, the presence of obstacles or city walls, types of movement (walking, floating, flying) and so on.And this is without taking into account unit stats (physical attack vs. defence, magical/elemental attack vs. resistance), traits, special abilities, morale (which influences critical chance), combat spells, unit and battlefield enchantments, unit types, etc.The basics of combat are simple. Click on a unit, right click to attack an enemy unit. But is the enemy unit far enough to trigger the charge ability, can I flank it, what's the chance of my special effect triggering, what elemental protections does it have, how many retaliations does it have remaining, does it have first strike, is it a polearm unit and will my cavalry take extra damage, can I weaken it prior to attack and how, can I kill it, will my unit survive the next turn after it attacks...there are many questions you could end up asking yourself.Learning about the units, what abilities they have and how they can be used and combined for maximum effectiveness is necessary for mastering the game but learning can be achieved in gradual steps.AoWIII retains the adjacency rule of previous games so all armies that are adjacent to the hex being attacked will also participate in combat which can result in some pretty large battles. Thankfully animation speed in battle can be adjusted during combat. Units and heroes that perform well and survive will accumulate experience points and become stronger acquiring new abilities as they level up and grow into valued veterans. StrategyOn the strategic level you build up your empire by settling or capturing new cities and expanding your borders in order to bring more and more resources under your control. There are resource sites to be captured, treasure sites to be explored, artifacts to be found, neutral creatures, cities and enemy leaders to be subdued. All in all the world is a dangerous place and venturing forth requires combat worthy armies and leaders. Luckily there is a beautiful cloth map to be zoomed out to in order to get an overview of the situation.Resource gathering and exploration primarily serve the goal of building up armies that can defeat the dangers that lie beyond your borders. A new addition here compared to AoWII are the creature dwellings which function as minor races that offer unique units for hire as well as their own sets of buildings. These dwellings can expand your unit roster and provide unexpected tactical  and strategic options.Both creature dwellings and independent cities can be outright conqured or negotiated with towards peaceful annexation by vooing them with money or performing quests. How you treat various towns and races can determine their attitude towards you as well as your alignment and diplomatic relations. Another addition is that clearing out and controlling certain treasure sites can unlock special unit or town upgrades in cities controlling those sites which can make some cities more valuable than others.All in all after 618 hrs of playing I have not yet experienced everything this game has to offer, so many untried combinations and strategies, which is probably the biggest endorsement I can give.

												I always knew I'd review this game, it was just a matter of when. At 331 hours, I believe I have enough exposure to offer an insightful look into AoW3. I picked this up on a whim during the Steam Summer Sale at 50%, having never played any other AoW games but myself enjoying Civ seemed like something I could get into. AoW3 would quickly become my most played game on Steam by a large margin and for good reason. There is so much good here, so much depth, variation, custimization. If you enjoy Strategy games, buy this game. If you enjoy Turn Based Combat, buy this game. If you enjoy City Building, buy this game. If you enjoy all these things AND Multiplayer for up to 8 people, FFA, Teams or AI partners or any combination BUY THIS GAME. 6 Races and 6 Classes that can be mixed and matched how ever you see fit, an ABUNDANCE of unquie units and Heroes that can be leveled and equiped with various gear that you can find or forge yourself. Sling spells in battle or on the World Map. Giants, Dragons, Titans oh my! Various map settings to take the game in whatever direction you want, size, land type, Underground, number of roaming Bandits etc. 2 Main Single Player Campagins and multiple Scenarios to play through. Up to 7 different full armies in Turn Based Combat. This game has it all and plenty of highlights I'm forgeting. BUT. And there always has to be a but. I do have some complaints to address here as well after all my praise. The community  is FAR too small, SO BUY THIS GAME. Also there are occasionaly minor issues connecting with players (which a simple restart of the game remidies) but the problem is there and it needs addressed. Other than that, this game is perfect at what it is. It's some sort of Civ meets Fire Emblem, coming from someone new to the series and never played Might and Magic. This is worth full price. Buy it. Add me. And read my guide to help you get started too :D			"

												Turn-based strategy, how boring.Then this game changed my (gaming) life. (To be honest, I also love Heroes 5)Look at the DLC tabs and you'll only see 3. Incredible, isn't it? Only 3, developers must be lazy. No, you're wrong. These DLCs, except ""Deluxe Edition"", are big. They're more like ""Expansion Packs"", if you're a good ol' RTS player you'd know what they are (Remember Warcraft 3's Frozen Throne? That is an expansion pack!""). I'm actually impressed about this, great job on it, developers!Many other reviewers mention the ""Random Map""  system and how great it is. Yeah, I admit, it's not really that very customizable by itself, but it's great nonetheless. I can imagine it being overly-complex if it was a lot more customizable anyway. And if you don't like random maps, well, there's always scenarios, community maps and so on.That's right, for a turn-based strategy, there's actually a workshop, and it's not a ""CSGO-style"" or ""Voteshop"" workshop, where, if you want an item to be in the game, it can be as long as it gets a lot of votes. Right now, the SDK offers a good enough freedom, but I heard that it will be better on the next updates.Also, aren't you tired of stupid, useless hotfix patches and so on? Make a hotfix, break another thing, a hotfix again, blahblahblah (NOTE: I'm not talking badly about developers who do it, there is always a bug after a patch and a hotfix may be necessary, but when there's a small patch for something so simple, useless or just decorative with no necessary bugfixes, yeah, I'm sure you know what I mean) and BOOM you may just lose interest. Luckily, AoW3 goes the Good Ol' style; only make patches when fully tested and necessary.By the way, this may not be of high interest since not everyone is an audiophile (personal note: I tend to hate music), but the Music? This is music made by Michiel van den Bos. Name might mean something, name might mean nothing. I'll just say that if you listened to Unreal music and Overlord music AND you loved it, you WILL LOVE the music in AoWIII. Do buy his soundtrack, he deserves it, the guy made this beautiful orchestral music with love for love...Or something.Also, he's very nice, you can see it on his YouTube comments ;)All of his songs are great, but if you want SOME recommendations, here;

												Very well put together game, and the devs are supporting it better than I have ever seen a dev support a game before. The game is a bit of a combination of homm and civ, I would reccomend it highly. If you are new I reccomend to play a few single player maps before playing the campaign which is hard at times.			"

												If there was ever a competition between Heroes of Might & Magic and Age of Wonders, you can sleep easily knowing that it is over.Age of Wonders wins.And with the third instalment of the series, the game is giving Civilization a run for it's money as well. Indeed, conquering a fantasy world has never been more fun, and AoW creates beautiful situations and, thanks to the hero/civilization customizer, unique factions. Like technologically advanced elves, or druidic dwarfs. But the battles? The battles are really damn memorable, and can pin up to 6 regiments against each other, and up to 3 armies can join a fight, making the largest battle 18vs18 units. You will doing everything possible to not loose your most well trained soldiers as well, thanks to the promotion system.Another small, but very nice feature is that the custom heroes/civilizations you create can be used by the AI when playing a skirmish. Meaning you can meet Sauron, Tyrion or any other characters you created. (the heroes have some appearance customization options as well, though not too many)The game will create memorable moments. Like the time when, while busy with my northern expansion, my kingdom of religious orcs was sheepishly invaded from the east by a distant (and so far peaceful) neighbour. After losing a city, i mustered my entire armada and, like Russia on 90% Georgian sale day, invaded and conquered their entire kingdom in a matter of a few turns. But this is were some might see a problem, and there are a few with this game:- AI is really not that good, not even on harder difficulties. it can stand it's own in battles, you might even loose a few if you're not careful, but the strategy map AI seems rather dumb;- ""Classes"" (aka civilizations) with a level-1 scout spell will have a massive advantage over other civs, since they will get a good scouting unit early and cheap;- Multiplayer does not have ""Simultaneous Turns"" options, which in PvP makes sense, since the battles need to take place, but it also makes Coop (players vs AI) almost impossible, unless you like waiting 6-7 minutes in the end-game for your buddy to take his turn;- zooming out to maximum displays a beautifully crafted map... that displays no borders unless the area is in your line of sigh (minor, personal, grudge). you'd think that, if X kingdom conquered Y city, word would reach my court, eventually.

												Vote for Age of Wonders 3 for the ""Only Five More Minutes!""-Award for the Steam Awards!The third part of a game franchise is often where things are starting to go downhill rapidly, especially if the franchise has been around for a long time (1999) and managed to establish something like a ""cult following"". The franchise left some big shoes to fill when they released Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic 11 years ago, and Age of Wonders 3 fills them admirably. At its core the Age of Wonders series are turn-based strategy games with turn-based strategic battles set in a fantasy world full of fantastic creatures and magic. You pick between different races, create your leader, build an empire and set out to claim the land as your own. You can forge alliances with other leaders (both AI or other players, if you play multiplayer matches) or try to conquer the world on your own. Your leader and hireable heroes are different to your main army in that they can level up and gain a plethora of new abilities and equippable items. Magic is an always-present factor in Age of Wonders. You constantly research new sorceries and in battle you will most often find yourself flinging powerful spells with your heroes while the rest of your army engages in more traditional combat, which also has its own nuances with line-of-sight penalties and flanking mechanics, on top of other things. Age of Wonders 3 stays true to the spirit of the previous titles while bringing new features to the table. The most game-changing feature is the introduction of classes. When you start a game you pick a leader, race, class and specialization. Each class gets many dedicated units that are restricted to this class only, for example Arch-druids can get hunters while Mages can summon wisps. The same is true for spells, a Warlord could get a spell that sends an enemy unit into a fit of rage, making it unable to tell friend from foe, while a Rogue might send a plague of brigands upon an enemy city.Here are some of the features you can expect:+ 6 playable races, all with their benefits and drawbacks (Draconian, Dwarves, High-Elves, Goblins, Humans, Orcs)+ Many different spells and units to research, depending on your chosen race, class and specialization+ Units can level up and gain increased stats, while heroes gain new abilities+ Neutral cities and dwellings that offer quests and access to unique units and items for your heroes+ 2 full campaigns serving as a tutorial+ Random map generator with a plethora of changeable settings to tailor maps to your liking+ 8 pre-built scenarios of varying sizes with their unique twists, for multiplayer as well as singleplayer+ Multiplayer with up to 8 players+ Ships with the same level editor the developers useIf you are into turn-based strategy games you owe it to yourself to at least take a closer look at Age of Wonders 3!

												What makes Age of Wonders 3 unique compared to other fantasy 4X, and real core of the game are it's turn based tactical battles, there's some serious crunch to them. There are a lot of supporting mechanics, such as spellcasting, flanking, and varying unit types and abilities, but what it all adds up to are tactical battles where you always have interesting choices to make. The battles are fun to watch unfold even after playing for hundreds of hours.The game comes with two fairly long single player campaigns, a random map generator, and an editor that allows you to make your own maps, scenerios, and campaigns.Multiplayer works well, but unfortunately the tactical battles can cause things to grind to a halt. I don't recommend trying to play more than a one on one multiplayer game unless you and your opponent have entire days worth of free time. It's unfortunate considering Endless Legend, another fantasy 4x, integrates tactical battles into the strategic layer nicely and supports multiple tactical battles at once, something Age of Wonders 3 can't manage.AoW3 also has PBEM mode, which I play a lot of. Unfortunately you can't control the player vs player battles in this mode, it's autoresolve only.Overall this is a great game. I also recommend the two expansion DLC that have been released.(edited July 11th 2016: fixed some spelling mistakes)			"

												Nothing is ever my cup of tea.  This game is my cup of tea.  It's kind of like playing five or six games of Civ V at the same time, on two maps.   If fantasy themed stuff don't turn you off, and if you like 4x strategy of the Civilization variety, it's well worth giving this a try.  I'm the type who searches and searches for the perfect game, so I've tried Endless Legend, and Galactic Civilizations, and Empire Earth, and Age of Empires, and Beyond Earth, and on, and on.  Age of Wonders 3 is the shizznit.I will say this - if you only play this game for an hour or something and think you've seen it all and it's just silliness - well, it is just silliness for the first hour or so.  Play through a whole game, and I think you'll find there's a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥happening.  Play through a few games, and I think you'll find there's enormous strategic depth and complexity.And that's not even mentioning the tactical combat system, which is impeccable.I'm thinking of getting an Age of Wonders 3 tattoo.

												Bought Eador - Wasted time and money.Bought Fallen Enchantress - Wasted time and money.Bought the newest Heroes - Wasted time, money, and got information mined by EA.Bought Warlock - Had fun, but Warlock II is a waste of time and money.Saw AoW3 on summer sale and warned myself to not waste time and money; but I really like it compared to all the other incarnations. I like turn based, conflict oriented, strategy. It's not going to be as strategic as Total War, or as simple as Age of Empires- both genres I love. It is a Civ game, based on action and strategy and it's the best flavor I can find on Steam. The AI isn't perfect and it looks like they want me to pay for xpacs. You have to make an account with them to go online, but the game is still playable in solo mode without giving out your information.I guess I like this one because it looks good, runs smooth, the races are to my taste (traditional with a Warhammer kind of twist), has very few bugs, and a subtle and funny sense of humor. It's basically a blend of the best elements of all the Civs I've wasted time and money on.			"

												Imagine Civ 5, but with combat that actually felt fun to do, choices that were actually meaningful and the ability to create and flesh out your own leader of one of numerous races. The gameplay is less than stagnant, it has mob support and it's campaign is awesome.			"

												Age of Wonders III is an excellent 4x Strategy Game. I first found this game when looking for a game similar to the late 90's game called ""Lords of Magic"". Lords of magic was quite similar to this game, but so much was done wrong in that game. The AI was just too simple, once you knew a couple tricks - you could beat it without thought. Not so for Age of Wonders, the AI is a good challenge, to me at least. There are a number of classes to pick from as well of a number of skill paths to tailor for your character that will change the play style for any class. The lore and immersion is fantastic, the help/information system is very in-depth and explains any game concept I've had a question about. One thing I really like about this game is the ability to create my own leaders for either the AI or myself and then customize who I'm up against or just let it pick randomly. The game seems pretty well balanced overall, although the Necromancer AI leaders can tend to get fairly powerful and be an incessant threat if they get far enough. Although, there are classes and skill paths that can take care of this easily - not every class/skill combination will do well against them. But this game offers a lot of custom settings when creating a new map, so you can just choose not play against AI classes that might be too tough for your level of play or make them all one class, if you so choose. This game runs good in a seamless window as well as full screen - so those with mutiple displays will not be disappointed. The mouse automatically constrains to the play area for easy scrolling around the map/battle field - and also handles switching to windows very easily. I don't think this game has ever crashed on me at all, it's stable and runs well. I have to also give praise to the music in this game. It's excellent. I love the soundtrack in this game. I play this frequently, and will buy more expansions in this series without hesitation. 10 out of 10!			"

												I never played any older part in this series, just so you know. Also I review the game with all DLCs so far (Necromancer was the last), but only the single layer part.This game is really fantastic :) I have now almost 200 hours in gemeplay and still have not finished the last campaign (and not even started smaller maps or MP). Pro+ Tactical fight is great. With the same stack of unit(s) you can either loose all or win with no loss. It's all about preparation and tactics.+ I like the storytelling and the voices are quite nice (especially the halfling hero)+ The maps are very different and made with much love+ Really overwhelming (in a good way) amount of units, monsters and heroes+ The ingame help is fantastic. Press F1 and simply search. With a few exceptions everthing is explained very good.+ The graphics lack detail and are kind of old, but very athmospheric+ I get bored easily, but this game suprises me even after 200 hours of gameplay with new units, new skills. new game concepts, races, monsters....+ 18 months after release there are still new DLCs with quite heavy modifications and also free updates with new game conceptsCon (mostly only minor)- The UI just sows you two ros of skills for your hero. I discovered only in the last cmapaign that not more skills than 12 are shown. You cann access them with clicking on your heros portrait but I sure missed some before. This could be easily solved with pressing of alt and shift to swap between more skills. Developers?- not all things are explained in the ingame help. What is ""weakness 5""?- Diplomacy is very basic and can be exploited by evil heroes (breaking peace = bonus points)- The necromancer seem to be not as balanced as the other classes. One of it's main features is reanimation of your troops, your hero or other troops. This can simply be stopeed by placing living units on top of an (un)dead stackIf you lke turn based exploring and combat and love good tactics, I really recommend this game to you.			"

												If you like the Civilization games, you will like this game. Especially if you also enjoy fantasy and adventure. It is kind of like a mix between Civ, Black and White and WoW (love it!!!); as you have to choose a race and class and you pick up pieces of magical equipment on the way that improve your skills in battle-scenarios. Also you can choose to be either neutral, evil or good, depending on how you play the game: do you make people like you by buying them off, win land by completing quests or greedily claim it all by being a mean warlord-bully? It is really fun to try the different classes and explore the  different maps hunting for treasure and fighting monsters. Great game. Many entertaining hours to be played. Civilization gets very boring after a while, so if you're looking for something like Civ, but more creative and fun, this is your game.			"

												I looked forward to this game for months, pre-ordered it and took the afternoon off to play it the day of release. I consider myself well within the target market for AOW III, as I mostly play games along the RPG-Strategy spectrum.As much as I hate to say it, I agree entirely with the top-rated negative review (by dacasonic). AOW III isn't bad, it just lacks depth. There are way too few units (really just one type of : light infantry, heavy, infantry, archer, cleric, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, trebuchet for everyone + 4 class units?), the research is one-dimensional (unlock a handful of units, terraforming and some spells), tactical spells are somewhat varied, but can't be used nearly enough and don't feel impactful due to a (in my opinion) mediocre resource system....In essence, my biggest qualm with the game is how little there is to look forward to. In HOMM, I look forward to unlocking level 5 spells, top-tier creatures or upgrading my hero, because those things immediately feel impactful and rewarding. In Shogun II, I can't wait to get those hero samurais on the field or finish a massive citadel in a border city. In civilization, reaching milestones (wonders, key techs, even your first settler) feels bloody great and is immediately rewarding gameplay-wise. Even in Fallen Enchantress, a second-tier X4 game, upgrading towns, levelling heroes and reaching certain research milestones feel rather gratifying and makes the player want to go on ""one more turn"".There is no equivalent in AOW III. Cities don't feel worth caring about (and it's a drag to keep them from getting overtaken by sneaky flying invaders). There are no great projects to feel excited about. Units are obtained early and the game turns into a variety-less grind within an hour of its start. Maybe the game could have been salvaged by a better hero progression and XP distribution system, to give the player something worth caring about. Levelling up heroes (XP earned when attacking other units) will grant a few points to invest in simple stats or underwhelming perks (20% resistance to an element). A talent tree with meaningful incremental investments (see shogun II, or even fallen enchantress...) coudl have helped the game a lot.I played AOW III on a mid-level laptop bought a year ago (well within reccomended specs), and the game ran rather poorly after a while. Naturally, this could be a problem on my end.			"

												It feels a lot like Heroes of Might & Magic had a baby with Master of Magic.I HIGHLY suggest reading some of the reviews here.  The negatives aren't all bashers, the positives aren't all fanboi's.  You'll get a good picture of what this game offers and where it is lacking.  This is my take.Pro's: The hex-7 combat. You can flank prior to engaging, but you may leave an army vulnerable to attack (it affects placement in the battlefield.. except against a city)The hero ""Leader"" capabilities.  Each army (group of 6 units including hero) can have a hero as a leader.  Heros can pick from abilites to strenghten themselves or provide army-wide bonuses.The Dreadnaught Class (while overall not high on my personal list) is really neat.  They are mech-based, rather than magic.  If you use their higher special units, you need other special units to heal them.  This matters most if your empire included multiple races.  Healers can't heal machines, and workers can't heal normal units.  I like that concept. :reusgreed:Spell options are ""random"" which helps split up the monogamy of game play (with a few exceptions).Underground & above ground, + teleporters, water tunnels, and 6v6 ""dungeons"" with unique item (Strong, Epic, Legendary, and Mythical difficulties. :ghlol: )The graphics. Con's:The basic race & class units are carbon copies of each other.  Slight differenced being pure damge vs a resistance-based damage type)The buildings are all exactly the same (except the T2 & T3 class buildings.. but the resource from them isn't a game changer).The spell system is lacking, in comparison to Master of Magic.  There are obvious ""winners"" for large maps/games, which are to be avoided in smaller/shorter games.As above, there are several abilities/spells which only have true functionally in MP... thus wastes a spell slot.Again, as above, the spells are generated ""randomly"" based on your leader choices.  While not entirely bad (MoM was like that also), the MultiPlayer-biased or large map-biased abilities aren't balanced out of the choices.  Likewise, they don't recive more weight in those circumstances.So that's really just one big one, split into 3 parts and the last being a pro & con.--------I've not gotten the xpac.. but that's supposed to add a few more nice things to the game.  Worth the expansion price? Not sure yet.  Next sale though.. ;)There are a few things they could do differently, from a deisgn standpoint, but given the origins and overal gameplay..  It's definitely a good $20-30.00 game.  Not sure about $40-45 (not counting the expansion)Apparently there is a bug that can crash and lose all of your data.  I haven't run into that one yet.  It does have occasional ""lag"" on the large + maps.I defenitely enjoy it, so far, I'm just a bit picky about things. --------What they could do to ""fix"" some of the holes in the game:Make a couple of ""difficult"" races, that are OP'd, but  cost more.Make a couple of ""easy"" races, that are weak, but fast to max out.Mix up the complexity of the city structures.  Maybe Orcs only get a shrine, not a grand temple, etc... then balance it out other ways. (can tie into above)Get rid of the ""Knowledge Points"" resource.  It becomes 100% worthless at some point in the game. :angrytitan: Merge ""Mana Income"" and ""Knowledge Points"" and let the player balance the resource between the two. (mana income if dor spell upkeep, unit purchase, initial spell cast, etc..  Knowledge Points only go to how fast you research spells)Unbalance the spell system some more.  Let a Mastery level always yield a really bad@$$ unit and global power.Weigh out some of the spells that favor different game maps and MP vs SP.   There shouldn't be a clear ""winner"" for them, on that front. (These are in the Class-specific spells, regardless of your focuses, and the one focus realm of expansionisim.)  If a balance can't be reached easily.. simply making a counterpart (with a note on each as to what they favor) that is equally beneficial in the opposite playstyle is fine.			"

												I discovered this game about one year ago and never stopped playing it. I'm a big fan of strategy games and AOW 3 has really met and exceeded most of my expectations. I recommend to purchase the two expansions Golden Realms and Eternal Lords because they add a lot to the base game. Gameplay is a mix of Civilization and Might and Magic: you build and conquer cities and occupy resources to be able to field powerful armies and defeat your enemies. But what really shines through is the great variety of units, spells, maps, geographies and playstyles that make AOW3's replayability almost endless. There are 9 races, 7 classes and about 15 magic specializations that can be mixed and matched in endless combinations. The races play similar but have different strengths against each other. The classes play different, i.e. Archdruids summon animals, Horned Gods and build Hunters and Shamans and their armies are very fast, Dreadnoughts build machines of increasing power and are way slower. Then, an elven archdruid focuses on range and shock damage while a goblin archdruid focuses on blight damage and fast growth of their cities.Necromancers gain most of their armies from dead enemies, sorcerers and archdruids from summoning spells, warlords and theocrats from recruiting in cities, etc.Early game plays different from late game, and the random map generator allows the customization of every map feature.The graphics, art and storyline of the campaign are superb. The atmosphere of the game is unique, mysterious and magical. Game is easy to grasp but hard to master because of the miriads of combinations and customizations possible.Highly recommended5/5			"

												EDIT:I have well over 1000 hours into this game (drat!) and every time I think of putting it down, I keep coming back.  It's been a long time since a game grabbed me like this one.  Great game!  replayabiliy is insane.WOW!Short review:  If you have any doubts from the trailers and are thinking ""Yeah, I want to get this game.""  You are probably right and do so immediately.For a bit more detail:I'm not even more than 170 turns on a big map,I can already tell you that this is an awesome game.  At first I thought it was just going to be another 4x clone, which are also great, don't get me wrong, but it's a lot cooler than a lot of games I have played.  The thing that sets it apart to me is that IT'S DEEP.  And while production and exloration and exploitaing are still the core of the game, there are a LOT of other elements that you REALLY have to consider if you are going to win.  It's much less of a numbers game and a lot more of a strategy game like CHESS.  It is mainly an empire conquest game as well.  There IS diplomacy, but you best be prepared to back that up with force.  It's not really a builder game, but you can totally turtle up if you want to.  If you want to survive in the world you have to maintain your empire.  And thats' before you even meet other players on the max size map.First off, you have to create your game.  As per most 4x games, there are a ton of options.There are at least 4 starting modes ranging from nothing but a city builder and a couple of military units, to having a fairly established state with big armies so you can go right to combat if you want!Next, you get to create your LEADER.  Your leader has a class, and a race. You can completely customize this leader just like an MMO or RPG. There are several classes and several races so that is a lot of options and there are both racial AND class bonuses.  All the classes are ""rock paper scissors"".  They all have different strengths and weakneeses and they are designed to be equal, if different.  I haven't confirmed how balanced they are yet.  But if you want voral bunny rabbits defending your city, Hobbit Druid has it!  In addition to that, you can style your charcter as you want, create your own flag and colors.  You get to choose 3 major abilities for your leader, such as the power to summon fire elementals out a pool of many!  You feel an imediate connection with the character.When you get in the game, it's EASY to pick up if you have any experience with a 4x game and even novices can probably figure it out if they click enough things and there are tool tips on everything.  It was very easy for me to pick up.  The maps are great looking, but the cool part is that there are Volcanic, plagues, frost, and I think a couple of more types of territory and the TERRITORIES are ALSO rock paper scissors for the RACES of your leader and heros, and this factors into the game.  If you send anti volcanic troops into volcanic territory they are going to be far less efficient because moral will be low.  Things matter in this game.  Another actually cool thing is that there AREN'T these giant research build trees to go through.  You can upgrade a city to max pretty quick in easy mode, which I am playing now in order to get a better handle on the game, but I'm sure the STRATEGY racks up quick.  There are like 3 levels for most abilites.  If you want to park your city and just produce mana you can do that.  Some units can fight on water.  Heroes can and do level up, and units can gain veterancy.Build cues are kept to a maximum of 5 cue items, either research or unit production.  Yes, it means you will visit your cue more often, but it works in this game because there are less actual cities on the map with an even spread.  There aren't a lot of city upgrades, so you can blow through them pretty quick.  BUT each of them matter a LOT.  You have to research archers if you want archers.  If you want to build a weapn forge (which crafts actual items for your heros) you have to research it first as expected.  There were about maybe 15 unit types under the hobbit units. (give or take).  Armies are also streamlined because you can only have a maxium of 6 units per army (at least in the game I am playing, not sure if you can change that, but I don't think so.  This is GOOD because you are far less concerned with how BIG your armies are, but WHERE they are and what units are in them!  Another thing is that each hero or your leader in the game has their own character sheet and as they gain levels you can spend points on any NUMBER of spells and abilities and you actually USE these abilities in combat!  There is ALSO a ""diablo like"" item page complete with a bag, and character outfitting, and you can send items from one hero to another.   The time it takes to do that is based on the distance of the heroes from each other.  So all the gear AND the spells make this hero or charcter very unique and deployable for specifc roles in an army.IN addition to that you have a SPELL BOOK which keeps each of the spell abilties of all of your heroes in combat and also GLOBAL spells that you can use to rain fire down units, or convert plague land to fertile forests for example.  You have to SHARE mana between the strategic spells and the close combat spells so it has to be managed wisely!  You learn spells by using research points (candles!) and there are many of them!  You can only cast a certain number of strategic spells per turn, depending on what they are.  Also, the spells are somewhat dictated by RACE and CLASS!  So the spellbook is different for each game.  But some classes are bad at magic and a lot less effectve with less options.  The Warlord class for example.  But they make up for that with better armor and weapons and archers.In addition to your basic units that you produce, when you are successful Heros offer to join, and you can have them join you for a one time fee (I think all units have maintence fees, as expected).  Once a hero joins you, they get a character sheet EXACTLY like your Leader's charcater sheet.  Every hero you get is randomized based off race, class, and abilities so they are all UNIQUE.  Sometimes you can win a unit in battle, or a random unit to town will join you.  The map is filled wtih independants and non-player kingdoms.  They can be hostile or neutral.  If you try and conquer them, some will run but some will fight.  Best be prepared if you want  to win, but stay close enough to your cites or a dragon might blow through and mess up your day!  Sometimes there is an opportunity for them to run, and you can choose between killing them or letting them run.  If you let them run you get good alignment and if you kill them you get evil.  Yes, there are good and evil abilities available when you spec your leader and for your heros.So basically, between the several terrain types, the rock paper scissors aspect of the heros and leader as well as chaning the compositon of each 6 unit army, you get BAZILLIONS of combinations, and all of the race units are themed for that race like the Hobbit Eagle Rider.  This means just a crazy amount of replayability.Finally, the COMBAT is VERY cool!  When you zoom in to the battle (IF you choose to manually fight it out) it's an area themed for the place it is.  I went in to one battle zone in a shrine and the objects decorating the shrine created obstacles that had to be worked around in the fight!  Terrain IN the fights is absolutely factors into game play.  Flanking and charging are ALSO part of the game.  If you have a hero on a mount you can charge into an enemy.  Each spellcaster can cast 1 spell per turn, so the combat really revolves around all those abilties you chose for your character.Anyway, it's all amazing.  If you like strategy games OR RPGS OR 4x genre games, you will very likely like this one.I see many hours of gaming awesomeness ahead.			"

												Long story short: Simply the best turn-based 4X game in years.The good bits:* Competent AI* Huge variation in races, classes, spells, abilities and units* Excellent tactical battles that keep you on your toes.* Great soundtrack* Vivid fantasy setting* Plenty of options in the robust random map generator to drastically alter every game you set up* Exploration is a blastThe weaker bits:* Diplomacy is servicable, but it's nowhere near Civilization levels* No more naked Nymphs :(Extra bits:* Very dedicated support from the developers* New expansions bring crazy amounts of content* Regular free patches with new mechanics and additional free contentAm looking forward to some PBEM games once the system goes live!

												9 / 10 This is combat oriented 4x game. or more like little combat dedicated 4x game smiliar to HOMM or civilizations.Graphics are ok, music and sound effects are kinda cool game play really feels great. The game lacks some empire menagements  when it comes to empire building like other 4x games like Cilvilzations. Few choices you can make , few buildings you can build , and economic stuff game is too simplifed and shallow. And i have to say it is disappointing. But when it comes to combat , the game has the best combat mechanics. Unlike civilzation 4 combat system (And some bit from civilization 5) which luck plays major role in the game and you have little control about the combat itself, this game has some edge. You re no longer waiting for outcome after just throwing dice. Instead you actively engage in combat , and you can make a lot of tactial choices in combat. It feels like heroes of might and magic combat style but it has some more advaced combat mechanics and introduced some nice concepts to battle filed. You can flank your enemy , use special talents , you can bait them out... etc  And yea this makes the game difficult to learn somewhat and could be little confusing but this is much better than You just attack the target and waiting for the outcome and saying like ""Oh crappp my modern infantry just got owned by pikemen , the odds were 99% purely because the luck turned out♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;  I really still hated some luck based combat mechanics like ""Chance for your spell failure 40%"" and pesky halflings who evades 10% of attacks. but i think they removed a lot of luck based thing in the game. Theres still some things are totally governed by the luck but its less often and less frustrating then other simmliar games. The game units feels like AOE 3 , the races are unique and features simmliar units but the each races got some little bit of tweaks ""Goblin pikemen has the life drain and much stronger then others , while the elven one has the lightning attack , Draconian pike legions can fly"" and theres quite noticable amonunt of themThe hero / leader customizaions are quite remakable as well . you can experiment with a lot of magic / economic / combat oriented specialization and it is really fun playing with different races / classes  / specailization This game requires several hours of game play to learn basic stuff but it will be rewarding as you get better and gameYou can expect a lot of from game if you re fan of TBS like civilzations .P.S if you re planning to get just 1 expasion pack i recommend Eternal lord one it has the more volume then the other one.

												To say I like this game would be an understatement. With over five hundred hours on record, and a healthy amount of those hours spent playing multiplayer with members of the Something Awful community, and most if not all the hidden things explored, I still find joy in loading this game up and taking a necromancer out for a spin as I turn the entire world into an open grave. I still find myself impressed by the swathe of modding content, adding more hours to the lifespan of this game.On that note, it is worth emphasising, Please get the collection and not just the base game. Eternal Lords is worth the difference alone, while golden realms is also a really strong expansion. The Delux DLC is a nice bonus but the real prize is Eternal Lords. Necromancers are a very fun class but Tigrans and Frostlings are also great races to play as well. Now, lets discuss comparisons. This is not Civ, nor is it Endless Legend. In both of those games, you have a few other ways to win, you can play as an economic powerhouse who wins by driving everyone into a happy friendship circle. This is not how Age of Wonders 3 plays. War is here. War is how you win. * Drive your enemies leaders to their knees and take their thrones. * Find the seals of power, drive away the guardians and stand upon them, facing rival kingdoms and angry elementals until you master control of the place of power and turn it upon your foes in victory. * Unite races together and ignite beacons of unity, driving your enemies mad with envy as you prove your mastery of diplomacy by the sword as well as the tongue. You do not win Age of Wonders by becoming king of treasure hill or cutting into other cultures like a knife, You win age of wonders by the sword and the spell. You will lead mighty armies of golems, backed by the might of goblin riflemen. Armies of high elf berserkers, howling furious challenge. Armies of frostling spellcasters, standing alongside summoned beasts. Armies of undead humans, still wielding spiritual fire even while bound to your dreadful will. Heroes will be at your command to be equipped by the prizes you rip from ancient tomb and bandit-infested farmstead. From swords to rings to mounts, all waiting to be claimed and lost when your rivals finally kill your promising champion and scatter their prizes to the wind.You win in Age of Wonders in battle, and battle is what this game does very well. On this note I advise checking youtube for a few videos of the combat. Words don’t really capture it, nor do comparisons. Best to see for yourself.I think by this point I’ve said enough. There are other reviews that go into more technical details then I have, I am simply writing from a very bias place of love. There are battles to be won, cities to be courted, inn’s to be explored, caves to be feared, lairs to be cleared, heroes to be leveled, heroes to regret losing, items to be won, armies to be lost, beacons to be lit, seals to be defended and grand spells to be cast. Get to it.			"

												It's a true spiritual successor to Master of Magic and that's what I love about itI would estimate that I played somewhere in the vicinity of 1000 hours on the original Master of Magic (in fact, still have it and play it occasionally on Dosbox). It had been a pinnacle of fantasy TBS games, unsurpassed by any, in my opinion. until this game came along. To any MoM player, Age of Wonders III will feel right at home. From mage customization to the exploration of ruins and caves, the settling of new cities and the building of great armies, the researching of grand spells to strike your opponents and bless your lands... and of course the heroes - numerous and varied. The races are fairly unique, with no two feeling alike. Playing anything from Elves to Pantherfolk, the difference between units and cities are big enough to merit playing at least once with each race. Add to that the different classes and magic skills you can customize your leader with and you get near infinite replayability The music is great - I found myself walking around humming some of the battle tunes plenty of times... the visuals are fairly good for a TBS and I doubt anyone would complain much about them... The multiplayer returns the classic old Hotseat option, which definitely feels good for an old-timer like me...So far I've played well over 200 hours and I am still playing... it's just great.			"

												Edit 04/23/15: So I've done some multiplayer testing. The game is still super snowbally and overall, the mechanics still kill fun. I do, in fact, think the single player is alright now though.Again, keep in mind that I'm going to focus on the multiplayer aspect only. I didn't play civ to play by myself, and neither did I buy this with that intent.Old content/Base game (This is now current 04/19/15):First, the positives:Tactical combat: This is what the game sells itself with. The concept, how it's designed is actually quite fun on its own. If you like Endless Legend's combat, you would like this.Race/Class combos: One of my favorite things for the longest time was the different race and class combos would actually cause you to play differently based on what race you put with what class. The developers have indeed succeeded in improving parity some in 1.5.Map generator: More often than not, I enjoyed the randomness, aside from predicible positioning of capitals. Powerful treasures, like production materials/scrolls are now guarded.Diverse Units: Units are diverse, and even units from the same class may have differences between races.Now for the bad.Balance: Dear god, balance. Heroes have always meant to be powerful, and that is fine. But the majority of experiences players you meet will use heroes as spell casters. This doesn't sound so bad, right? Well, spells, in tactical combat have infinite range. If your hero is on the battlefield, it can hit anything. Your leader can do it even if he/she isn't there for double cost. The majority of matchups will be determined by spells. If not that, you will see tactics such as run and heal. In short, play to the utmost efficiency.Scouts/city mechanics: Scout wars are still annoying, and the flying ones are especially capable of taking cities, particularly the incorporeal ones. All units in any amount or strength are capable of burning any city in 2 turns, and any fort or watchtower instantly. I cannot emphasize this enough, the most central mechanic to continuing the game is the LEAST secure. This will turn your disadvantages into a landslide.The community: The community has become somewhat insular now, as 90% or more of the lobbies are locked. Join a steam group or the forums to try and get in, don't try to meet people in lobbies.Autocombat: To be frank, to manually do every battle yourself is not feasible in this game in multiplayer. Unlike Endless legend, which is very fluid about its manual combat for the most part, manual combat in this game stops all other action for every player that is not in combat. You either get to watch or not depending on what the host decided before the game starts. So you have to use autocombat... except that the AI in autocombat tries to resolve things as quickly as possible by having both sides rush at each other, tactics be damned. Therefore the losses are always higher than they should be, and unless you've played for as long as I have, you shouldn't expect to accurately predict the results, which to my knowledge is not a common skill.Fog of war: Once you initially explore the map, it shows everything happening except units. You see all changes and spell casting locations without vision if you're attentive. While this is a skill, it's not much of a fog.Patch 1.5:The new vassal system is actually pretty cool. You can now relinquish control of a city to the independents (vassalship is also the step before actually owning the city, too, so you can get it back). When you do this, the independents will pay you a portion of the total income and occasionally give you tributes ranging from resources to a small army (whose strength is based on the current size of the city). The vassal will also keep their city defended, which makes vassalship the answer to the player who lacks the ability to defend from silly things like wisp spam or something. It's not all good though. Much like burning a city, you can make a vassal out of any city in 2 turns no matter the size of the city, and after those two turns, the city will instantly spawn an army relative to the size of the city. Too much, too fast.Guard breaking: Now a thing.The new race governing and race happiness system adds a bit of flavor to the game that causes the way you play to have an impact on the people in your empire, and thus affect you. Now, if you migrate for optimization, it doesn't just impact your (ignorable) alignment, you've made one race pretty happy, and really upset another one. Good luck making use of them when their units are starting out unhappy. I have nothing but good things to say about this system, although I haven't had the time to explore every option with every race.Cosmic events: Adds random events to the game, which are mostly status modifiers. Some are positive, some are negative. Some only affect certain people. Some affect everyone. Fun in theory, but I find that I'm often annoyed by the results since it can cause damages to your empire through no fault of your own. The appearance of the boss drastically affects one person. The encounter is around legendary difficulty, and it roams the map. The items if you win are powerful, but I wouldn't lose a city temporarily or lose 4-5 units to secure it (in auto-combat). Overall, I think I would play with cosmic events off with other people to keep the frustration levels down for us all.Expansion content (yeah, I bought it to review):Necromancer is actually a rather nice addition to the game. It turns the class system a bit upside down because it has completely new mechanics added to the game (happiness and morale isn't a thing when you're dead, rushing causes your undead puppets to be destroyed instead, presumably because it's hard to rush and keep things safe, you also get population from killing things, which is kind of awesome). In practice, it plays a bit like a combination of theocrat (healing), sorcerer (supports are very important for more than just healing, and you get a decent spell selection), and warlord (with emphasis on debuffing rather than buffing, but you DO get some pretty nice battle enchantments like a warlord would).Frostlings: They play a bit like a combination of draconians and humans (I'm approximating), my two favorite races, so naturally I like them. They lose physical power in exchange for doing frost damage. Their pikemen are amazing (and tier 2). Love the race overall, but frozen flames (their support buff) will be op until it doesn't have fire resist (normally the race weakness), especially when used on frostling necromancer reanimators. (It also gives +2 fire/+2 ice damage to melee/range and inflict chilling, which is -20% ice resist/-1 defense.) Huge upsides in exchange for no healing.Tigrans: Poor Tigrans. Has the exact same weaknesses as orc (with even less healing!) with almost none of the upsides. -1 resist, no healing except support once per fight self-heal, who then lose their range for the rest of the battle, low range damage on archers in exhange for bleeding (in fairness, units do more melee damage to bleeding units... but no healing). You need considerable skill to make use of their unique talents.Halflings: Fun little race. They scale a lot on unit happiness. They have -20% phys resist in exchange for Lucky. A mechanic that makes every offensive ability have a chance to miss them. Seems not worth it at first, but it includes spells and such, and actually net decreases incoming damage. They lack elemental damage though.Specializations: Their themes are essentially chaotic magic, neutral good, neutral evil, and balance/anti-unnatural. They offer really nice tools that can offset racial and class weaknesses.Literally out of space, so I hope I wrote enough to help you guys make your own impressions, guys.			"

												I’ve been playing the Age of Wonder series for years, but I think that Triumph Studios deserve a veritable Roman Bacchanalia for creating Age of Wonders III. It’s proof of what an independent game developer came accomplish with vision, determination, and care for the gaming experience.The customization options are generous and the game delivers what many games of the 4X adventure fantasy only promise, an infinitely repayable and engaging experience with several modes of play. Personally I like the Adventure mode, for what better fun can be had in a virtual fantasy world then exploring, dispatching monsters, and discovering vast hordes of loot and heroic upgrades? The races are predictable—orcs and frostlings and such—but their weapons and powers are not. I mean, really, what other game out there offers foes who toss exploding chickens at you and gobs of ordure? As a “seasoned gamer” of 60+ years, I play games not only for the pleasure they afford but I’m convinced, and there is some seminal research to suggest, that video gaming helps with both cognitive skills and hand-eye coordination. An antidote to Alzheimer’s? Too stiff a claim as yet, but it seems I can always remember minute details of my 13th year after an hour or two in AOW III's expansive realms even if they are details I’d rather forget.Let’s not overlook the aesthetic qualities of games like Age of Wonders either. The game offers campaigns, scenarios, and random maps that are varied, beautiful, and endlessly surprising. Thank you, Triumph!			"

												A welcome addition to the franchise, with some new additions and some drawbacks.Pros:+More strategic layers than previous Age of Wonders games with Race/Specialization/Class combinations+Unique balance of over-world construction, exploration, conquering/destruction, and tactical battles+Strong RPG elements for a strategy game with Heroes and Leaders' leveling and meaningful choices along the way+Interesting strategic variety with interaction of terrain and races+Many and meaningful strategic options/choices in units (skills, abilities, looks, interactions) and cities (city types, upgrades) and empire quests+Relatively easy to use map editor/makerCons:-Less friendly fire (I enjoyed how friendly fire was handled in previous games) and height advantages-Less atmosphere than age of wonders games through slightly weaker lore, presence of magic, racial uniqueness, and music/sfx-Story is a bit weak-3D Models are a bit ugly-Less races (Currently) than in other age of wonders gamesDifferences from other 4x Strategy-Fantasy Games:-More tactical battle focus-Less focus on constructionThe Future:The community is strong and kind enough.The developers are continuously working on the game and listening to the players.New races and classes are coming out.New race relations coming out.New balances and bonuses coming out.More modding coming out.Buy or No?If you are experienced with 4x strategy games... I would get this game.While the genre probably could use a game to revolutionize it a bit, this game does enough new things to keep your interest if you are captivated by 4x genre.  You may be annoyed with some things here and there, but overall the balance is strong enough and they are working on improving the balance and adding more content to sink your teeth into.If you are interested in fantasy lore, role-playing/story-making, primarily and racial interactions... I would get it on sale or wait.Do some research on the game first; if you find the lore interesting, purchase it if you haven't played any game in the genre or wait to see how the updates improve and add to the game in a few months.  Keep in mind you can also create some interesting quests with the map editor/maker.If you haven't really played much strategy 4x fantasy games and are curious... I would get this game now or on sale.Your enjoyment of the game will be higher if you have an open-mind and like intricate game systems.If you are looking for a fast-paced, mind-blowing, competitive game... do not purchase the game or do more research.  The pacing is similar to other strategic games like Civilization.  Also, there is nothing in here that will take your breath away, at least immediately.  The engagement relies on the stories and histories that are created from the complex systems and events that occur.Overall...AOW3 is a quality game that could use some improvements.  Fortunately, the developers care so improvements are on the way.  There  isn't too much else in the genre being made at the moment either and is better than its nearest fantasy-strategy competitors.  But feel free to check out games like Warlock, Fallen Enchantress, and Endless Legend as they offer slightly different fare if tactical combat is not entirely for you.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is an excelent 4x game that focuses heavily on combat but should not be your first 4x title as it's so deep and complex that it will overwhelm you.This game is very similar to the ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" games but everything is taken to a next level. There are wide variety of starting races and classes. You even got 3 specilization skills on your leader. There are tons of stuff that are thown to your face right at the begining so I strongly recomend to watch a lets play video on youtube before jumping to a saddle youself. Heroes naturally level up as you proceed and they can be focused to be a healer,a disabler, an aura giver or a creature summoner for example. You can develop your empire to a way wish: getting everything by brute force or with cunning diplomacy. Whatever you choose war is inevitable in the end.The combat is executed excelent in this game and fighting is something you do almost every turn. Some fighting areas give units buffs or debuffs. Most terrains is also filled with natural obstackles that you can use to your advance. AI plays clever and will kill your units when it have a chance. Every unit has 3 action points and you can drain enemy units APs with diffrent kind of attacks and abilities what makes combat really deep and interesting. There is no pre-battle deployment and your units can get underfire the very first turn. I Feel mixed about lacking this feature: It's annoying to see your leader starting position being on a frontline and taking damage, however even now you still use your first turns to getting your formation up so is there really anything missing?There are random world wide events that happen every now and then which makes every game feel unique. Amount of items and abilities is just ridicilous and they can really alter you playing style. Not every items is ""+2dmg or +3 armor"", some give you unique abilities, auras, immunities or spells. You can also develop each race under your rule and try to complete special goals called ""empire quests"" while playing to get more powerful.There is no ""Technology tree"" in this game because most of the new learned things are not linearly linked to each other. This is without a doubt interesting feature when you have played this game a while but I'm pretty sure all the new players find this very confusing as you don't have a clue what you unlock after curent research is completed. Strategic minimap don't give almost any information about the map besides it's shape and location of the towns. I also didn't find any way to enlarge which is unfortunately as it really is a minimap.If you have patience to really study all the complex game mechanics you are probably going to spend a good portation of your time with this game. On the other hand if you have just played call of duty games and want to try something else, this is not for you. Start with Civilization 5 if you are looking for easy approach turn-based strategy game, because this is made for 4x veterans. Have played some 25 hours when writing this and I have just scarth the surface. Every game I find many items and monster I haven't seen before and develop more efective ways to use my units and vanish my foes.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												The city was lost. Orc civilians were rushing around, gathering belongings and fleeing their homes. On the horizon, six Ogres were marching forward. I had corralled every unit available in the area into the city, in a last-ditch effort to kill at least one or two of the foul creatures. The force consisted of 2 Musketmen, an Engineer, an Orc Priest and a Dread Monkey. None of those units could take a single Ogre on in a fight, but it was all we could muster. The plan was to force as many casualties on the Ogre's side, fighting them to the death, before our glorious leader came to avenge the fallen with his siege cannons and Juggernaut landships.I instructed the men to pour burning pitch made from Dragon Oil around the walls, in the hopes it would slow them down, and perhaps damage them further. Our leader cast a Mass Curse on the Ogres from across the world, using up all of his magical power for the time, which weakened their armor and resistance a little bit, but also, unwittingly, it seemed to drop their morale down from a high standing. The Ogres charged the city walls, and became immolated from the pitch. They yelled out in pain and anger, but all struck the walls with their fearsome clubs, shaking the very foundations. It seems the pitch wasn't enough to make these beasts think twice. I ordered the musketmen to fire down upon the beasts, and one fell in the initial volley, while the engineer handed one squad a set of freshly loaded muskets so they could fire again immediately.And then the Dread Monkeys began to fling their own excrement at these lumbering beasts. A foul, uncivilized tactic, but it proved to be too much for our would-be conquerors.The Ogre it landed on stopped everything it was doing, and tried desperately to rub off all the filth. The stench was horrific. Nearby Ogres were so repulsed by it that they fumbled, barely damaging the walls they were attempting to tear down. The burning pitch continued to sear their flesh, as the Musketmen fired volley after volley at the hapless monsters. The monkeys danced around, giggling and chattering in glee. Before the dastardly cretins could fling more of their filth at the Ogres, there were none left. All that remained were the charred, punctured corpses of what was once an impressive invasion, and not one of my men had fallen.TL;DR version: Dread Monkeys fling poo at an invading force of Ogres and demoralised them just enough that my ragtag group of defenders held onto a key city instead of being absolutely slaughtered.10/10 would fling poo again.

												I love this game: how many games will you ever own in life where you have played over 3,000 hours and counting? So replayability, robust performance, depth, availability of a wide range of mods and an active modding community is testament to the popularity of Age Of Wonders III. Triumph Studios (the developers) are responsive, engaged with their user base and deserve to succeed.Highly recommended.			"

												An extremely polished game with very intuitive controls/menus/interfaces.

As far as it's actual features are concerned it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it stays faithful to it's prequels in many parts, but there was probably no need to mess with tried and tested mechanics anyway.

												This game is truly a gem amongst the 4x genre. It does a great job of blending familiar combat mechanics of games like heroes of might and magic with the turn based empire building of more well known games like the civilization series. While not as complicated on the empire management side of things compared to games like civ, The very fact that you are constantly having to weigh your ofensive and defensive capabilities from the very beginning of every game prevents the pace from ever getting boring. Being able to combine races with empire classes provide a lot of diversity in unit bonuses and combinations which, between that and the game rule controls makes every new game unique.

												This is a really fun game. I like the tactical battles for this game. I have quite a few turn based fantasy 4x games, and the tactical battles for AoW have always been fun. There are lots of unit types. Also, players get to cast many spells while playing the game, both tactical and stratgic. Leader customization is great, and starting new scenarios is neat due to all of the choices availble. AoW III is also a very pretty game. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. There are spells that allow the player to change the terrain. Tactical maps also look good, with a lot of environment colors.Overall AoW III is a good, fun game.			"

Certainly one to watch out for on the Steam Sale if you are considering getting it.			"

												This has to be one of the best 4x strategy games I have ever played. Coming from the Civilization series, I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this game but I was pleasantly surprised. Age of Wonders III blends RPG and strategy mechanics together and creates a really unique experience. You can design your own character like in a real RPG game, deciding their look, race, and class which determines the types of units you can use and also the types of spells you can utilize and research (research spells instead of technology in this game). You get a massive Civilization-like map to build cities upon and explore and during combat you get to fight on a randomized map and do turn based combat with TONS of soldiers and hero units.  You can play Age of Wonders in a randomly generated scenario, campaign, or with friends in head to head multiplayer. Both of the campaigns for the game are very well done, have good voice actors, and compelling gameplay. The only real turnoff for the game for those coming from other 4x strategy games is unlike games like Endless Space and/or Civilization, the only way to really win this game is through conquest. For me, that's okay since I feel like the game has so much to offer with what it already has. My Score for the Game: 9/10			"

												Really solid 4X with extremely in-depth combat and plent of units, spells, etc. to play with to make your perfect army. The developers have show a huge amount of support for the game and have gone out of the way to listen to criticisms to iron out the flaws that stuck out on release. I definetly would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the 4X genre just for the combat alone.Note: This isn't fantasy Civ 5; The game focuses more on the war aspect of 4X's than it does the empire/economy management, so if your strictly looking for a game with that Civ feeling then you might want to watch some youtube videos to get an idea if this is a game for you.

												As of 12/3/16 this review has been modified. At the time, it was at 94% helpful. I hope that only goes up!You can see how many hours I have in this. It's only going to keep rising. I love this game. It may well be the best strategy game I've ever played. It's heavily combat focused, and that combat never gets old for me. I'm still learning all the time. The highest level AI remains a challenge for me, though that is largely due to its construction; it cheats on the same order as SCII's AI cheats, gaining massive resource bonuses, morale bonuses, etc. It's a challenge, but not a fair one. I still enjoy it!So, what's it about? War. The entire game is focused around going to war. Do not get it for empire building, there isn't any. The biggest decision you have to make with cities is when it's worthwhile to stop producing units in favor of a building of some sort. All of the buildings either unlock new units, upgrade units produced from the city, increase research output (used to research more WEAPONS), or make the city harder to take. The only victory conditions are war related.Is that a problem? No. Because the war is so good. The strategic map is for faking out your enemy, destroying their economy, causing their cities to rebel, and striking their armies with spells. The tactical map, entered for battles, is for destroying their armies, and no other purpose. And it is so good. Most of your time will be spent on the tactical map, trying to keep your units alive while inflicting as much damage as possible on the enemy. The tactical AI may be the best I've ever encountered at providing a challenge. You have to be careful, or even the weakest group of enemies can deal serious damage to you. It does have mild flaws, largely centered around valuing damage over keeping its own units alive, in many cases. Which makes it extremely dangerous, if not quite as viable in the long run. Harder difficulty settings easily counter this shortfall by giving it resource bonuses.Everything has a counter, but no counter is hard. You aren't going to be crushed because your opponent chose a ""better"" setup at the beginning of the game. You will always be able to find a way around it.While I myself do not play MP much, the community is alive, both in PBEM and live games, and there are periodic community run tournaments. Man, I've rewritten this review so many times, trying to keep it short. Too much to talk about, and I'm going to cut myself off here. This game is wonderful. I will be playing it, minimum, until Triumph puts out their next game. My metric for value on a game is that it's worthwhile at 3 hours per dollar paid. I'd say that it falls well beyond that benchmark. Want a game focused on tactical war? Get this. Full price, all DLC included, I recommend it.A note: The above said, this game will often go 75% off for base game, 50% off for the complete pack, and 40% for DLCs. If you're not going to buy it unless it goes on sale, that's the best you're going to get in the near future. I still say get it full price, support the company, it'll still be well worth the price.			"

												A solid game in the 4X category.  Rich in fantasy lore you can easily find yourself losing many hours as your submerse yourself in the game.  While I would argue that this game could use some more balance testing, your are given a wide array of upgrades and abilities and opportunites to customize more then you would normally get to in another game of the same genre.I would recommend this game to those looking for either a single player or multiplayer experience however patience is required during multiplayer games as it's not as fluid as the single player experience.

												Logged 250 hours beta testing the game. Not because i wanted to just test the game, but because i loved playing it. It is so good. A lot of depth and strategical planning involved. This is a highly recommended game from the YouTube guy who made the How to Play series. Check it out if your new to the game or the 4x/TBS genre as a whole :)https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhAjLeSwzp3hLPeLqY2p-R7Ubbauwhxpe "

												This game is similar to 4x games like Civilization or Endless Legend except that there's more emphasis on combat and less emphasis on other aspects like commerce, city building, or diplomacy. *Those other aspects still exist in this game but their purpose is mostly to facilitate battles.The combat is turn based and highly rewards you for good strategic play. Most fights come down to simply having stronger units but even if you have low tier units you can still sometimes win nearly impossible fights with a good mix of strategy and spells.Individual battles can range from one unit vs one unit to massive wars that can take nearly an hour to complete. If you're impatient (and are sure of victory or defeat) you can also select the auto option which will measure your strength against your opponents and the computer will instantly dictate the winner of the fight.  Each class rewards you with unique units and spells and each race also has specific units as well as its own strengths and weaknesses.  Some classes focus on mobility and ranged units, one focuses on spells and summoning, one focuses on resurrecting hoards of undead, one focuses on spying and debuffing, one focuses on healing and buffing, and the other simply conquers as much territory as they can to produce as many units as possible. On top of all that, when you make your hero you're also given a choice of specializations that even further customizes your spell choices and strengths/weaknesses. As you can see, this allows for nearly endless combinations of ways to play the game. They aren't just superficial differences either, each class/race/specialization you play will have dramatic impacts on how you play the game.			"

												Pretty good turn based strategy game. It is a mix of a few things actually, there is lite empire management (think Civilization), hero customization and - the main focus of the game - huge turn based tactical battles. For a game of this kind it's refreshingly bug free, but there are some serious balance issues still. Nothing that can't be patched though. And even in the release state I had a real quality 40 hours of enjoyment with it already. It can only get even better from here on.In the interest of full disclosure, here are the problems the game still has at the time of this review IMO:- Tier IV units are so much better than anything else, they make older units obsolete and the best tactic is rushing and spamming them. Also if you can't kill the enemy in time to prevent them from getting stacks of T IV units, you basically lost. If you have them, the battles lose their tactical depth. Just move forward and smash all opposition.- The heroes are super squishy and you instantly lose the game if they die (in the campaign, in custom maps they are still perma dead at least), which makes you not really want to use them, which is a shame because they are some of the most interesting units in the game- The economy is off, mana is practically limitless, gold is either no issue or a good sign that you'll lose within few turns if it becomes one- Little item variety, you'll quickly amass triple and quadruple copies of each item in your hero's inventory if you comb the map dilligently "

												I bought this game because my boyfriend wanted to play together. It was fun! Especially playing it local co-op. Sitting together, talk strategy, team up. Great experience!It reminded me of my favorite nostalgic game Heroes III. The choices of characters and races were broad enough, and the different enviroments were typical for a rpg-strategy game. Through the fights I loved that you have the options to zoom in anytime and get a close up. The graphics are very clear so I recommed to play this game with High Performances adjustments to get the best of the production. The single campaigns had a deep story and it gave you a lot of strategy challenges. Thumbs Up for this one! It gives you a  lot of gameplay hours!  "

												Take Civilization IV/V and strip away the complexity of luxury resources and strategic resources, as well as complex diplomacy. This is very loosely a 4X strategy game. And It's amazing. They have tuned the strategic combat system to practical perfection. If you enjoy turn based combat, and the idea of empire building, but want something more exciting or prefer battle. This is for you.Each civilization is pretty unique, though the humans could be a little better. The classes are ALL Unique though. And each one adds variety to the game.Overall I would say it is a solid game, that is worth getting if you are into the war part of 4X strategy games.			"

Age of Wonders IIIDeveloped and Published by: Triumph StudiosReleased: March 2014+ Rich and colourful high fantasy setting+ Deep and challenging tactical combat+ Beautiful soundtrack+ Massive unit variety, with the different race and leader variations+ In MP, only the host needs to own DLC for a match to use all the expanded features+ One... more... turn...+ The devs are active with the community, helping with issues and implementing features and fixes+ Steam Workshop, and not the paywalled kind- Very basic empire building- Could use some more game changing magic spells- Some slight balance issues- Some of the original campaign maps feel lame, forcing rushes before the AI gets stronger- Consistent lag in MP often up to 4-5 seconds on the strategic map- Visually unimpressive, with jaggies and 'blocky' terrain features- Low framerates on strategic map on my system far surpassing recommended specs, often down to 15(!) if Vsync is enabledAge of Wonders III sucked me in and after 150 hours played, finally having finished all the campaigns I still want to play more of it.  The base game is a solid fantasy strategic war game, and the two DLCs Golden Realms and Eternal Lords both add satisfying campaigns and a wealth of features and 'stuff', end result being a title that has a lot to offer.I would have liked to see better empire building and management in the game, and it could look better, and run better.  Even so I am greatly enjoying my time with this game and don't see myself deleting it from my hard drive any time soon.			"

												EDIT 23-11-2016 - This game still stands the test of time, if you still haven't bought it; Do it now!EDIT 17-04-2015 - With the new Eternal Lords expansion in combination with the free 1.5 patch, this game is even better than it was originally.Twelve years we waited for the successor of the excellent Shadow Magic (also available on Steam). And is it worth it? Hell yes!The graphics, soundtrack and (re)playability are excellent! As the Devs are a small company from Holland, and independent publishers, they actively browse and reply on the official forums, making notes of bugs (although there are very few bugs at release) and planning on fixing them in future patches. The same is regarding balancing issues. They are very actively gathering balancing suggestions and also implementing them thorugh patches. They are very close to the community and that is something most software companies can learn from. Regular patches are already released and more are in the pipeline.The game itself comes with an editor, so you can make your own maps/campaigns. Furthermore single-player options are two campaigns, about 8 scenarios and, the icing on the cake, a Random Map Generator. This generator makes very good maps with realistic landmasses. Maps can be selected for small to extra large size and 2-8 players.There is also a multiplayer mode which supports Hotseat (players take turns on the same computer), LAN (need to make contact with official servers first, after that it's offline), VPN (in beta patch at the time of writing) and normal multiplayer games through the internet.I already netted 165 hours in the game, which was released just 16 days ago (at the time of writing) and I just cannot stop playing! This game is highly recommended, not only for gameplay purposes, but also to support the independent developer!			"

												This is one of those games you think you're not going to like but ends up surprising you with how good it truly is. The best way to describe the game is like it's Civilization V without the city micro-management in turn for more indepth combat and multiple story driven chapters. If you enjoy strategy or hex-based games this is a definite must if it's on sale.			"

												Excellent fantasy based strategy game. Combines elements from Heroes of Might and Magic, and the Civilisation series to create a game with a focus on aggressive expansion. Pros:- Fun combat mechanics.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of spells/units.- Nice audio/visuals to go along with the fantasy element.- Well made campaign.Cons:- Bit of a learning curve if you haven't played any AoW game before.- Games can take a long time, especially when you first start and don't have a late game strategy in mind.- Using auto-combat can be risky.I would recommend getting the expansions after you've finished the main campaign. Well worth it.			"

												This game is like the beautiful love child of Total War: Warhammer and Civ V. It is now my most played game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys 4X strategy games, but there are some things you should know if you buy the game.-The smaller the map size, the easier the game. I could not figure out for the longest time why an Emperor AI would destroy me on a large map but I could beat him on a small map. The AI steamrolls, hard, with the buffs they get just for being on a harder difficulty. If you're like me and love giant maps with a ton to explore, turn the AI down a notch in difficulty.-The DLC do make the game a bit pay-to-win if you do player vs player. They might nerf how OP the Necromancer class is in the future but I doubt it, and some of the adept Wild Magic spells are extremely good. The DLC races seem decently balanced to me, so that's good.-The game crashes very rarely for me personally, that's a plus.Those are just some points I wanted to make for if you play. I hope to see you out there!			"

												I really enjoy this game. I've wanted to play a game like this for some time now. I haven't played the previous AOW games but I'm glad I finally found this one. It's a great blend of Civ and HOMM. I like that you need to be aggressive to win. There's a lot of action and conflict.The game has a great combination of races, spells, and units. The graphics are great and the customization of your leader are very nice. There are a ton of settings that you can adjust to enhance your game.The multiplayer is very good. If you autofight independents then it goes by fast. There isn't a lot of waiting around for your opponent to take their turn (hello Warlock games).I haven't even played the campaigns yet. I prefer sandbox mode.The expansion adds a lot to the game and is reasonably priced. I bought the base game on a 50% off sale. At $20 you cannot beat it. Knowing what I do now about the game, there is no doubt I'd pay full price for it. I highly recommend it.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is the best modern reimagining of Master of Magic, period. It takes most (but not quite all) of what was great about MoM, and puts it into a modern package, with a slick UI, great graphics and large single-player campaigns. It even improves significantly on some gameplay elements compared to MoM, like the tactical combat and the concept of leader domain.If you are a fan of Master of Magic, just buy it already, don't wait another second. If not, but you enjoy TBS or 4x games at all, buy it anyway.			"

												I have played Age of wonders game in the past so I am pretty familier on the game play of these type of games, let me start and say this game is the best graphical of the lot.   Now that I have that out of the way the detail that the developers have put in this game is pretty impressive.  Each individual unit makeup and descriptions are pretty well done as well pretty funny on some of the unit discriptions, similar to Warcraft humor.  The tactical combat is a pleasure to do even though there is a option for auto-resolve. I wouldn't suggest auto resolving too much unless your cut for time, and this game is not really made to be rushed and get it done game.  Like the old saying goes its good to smell the flowers sometimes and you should do this in this game because the animation and tactical combat is a thing of beautify.  The unit detail as you battle is so detailed I had to zoom all the way to appreciate the orc's armor and color scheme,  it's that good.You can tell they put alot of love and effort in this game.  There is so so much detail besides the units makeup, terrain, heroes, etc. etc...  I just can't go thru all of it, it was pretty much worth my hard earn money.   Gameplay is very addictive and the story is interesting and keeped me involved. Now everything isn't perfect like when siege units break down walls.  Its hard to see from the animation that the wall was destroyed or not.  I keeped attacking the same wall because of it.  Only way I knew that the wall was destroyed was that I accidently moved a unit past the castle and it moved threw the wall.  Thats probably going to be patched since this is fairly a new game.  I am sure there are other bugs but nothing I have played so far that crashes the game.  Its pretty stable and the turns are rather quick after you finish your round.  I would say it takes few secs for the next round, thats really fast, which is pretty impressive compaired  to game like Rome Total War 2. It seemed like forever to wait for your next turn the Total War game.  Yes these two games are different but just trying to point out that turns are pretty quick and fluid in Age of Wonders 3.   All in all I would highly recommend this game to any turn base strategist and fantasy buff.  The intereface is so easy I believe it might attract a wider audience besides the aftermentioned gamers.  Yes, this will suck your time like no other.  I went straight 4 hours playing and didnt even notice the time go by, thats how enjoyable this game is.  Just smell the flower and trust me dont rush threw this flower bed or you will miss the beauty of this game.NOTE: I purchased the game and was not a Beta tester or a employee of them. lol			"

												I have always loved both the mythological turn based strategy war games and the Civilization games, so when I saw this I went for it.  Man, I am not disappointed.  Personally, it keeps my interest better than Civ V because of the unpredictable variance of the random maps.  I started playing the recommended campaign, but that was right when I got it, and needed to learn how to play this game.  I quickly switched to the random maps and have been having a blast with the curve balls this game throws at you.  I took over a dwelling of giants at one point and was carefully upkeeping it before producing a giant unit due to the expensive maintenence when suddenly a city on my outer borders got attacked by a very nasty undead dragon.  The dwellings are cool if you can take them over, but are fierce opponents.  If you take over or are joined by an independent city of another race, you can make units of that race.   Learning the game is an experience that increases its replayability.  At first I thought goblins were unfairly weak, but after playing other races, I learned some goblin units are pretty darn superior for their type.  You can basically play the way you want - if you want to be warlike, go ahead and invade and break treaties, or whatnot.  There are rewards for getting an evil alignment as well as good if you want to try more diplomatic methods such as doing quests to absorb cities.  I can't say much about the campaigns or the multiplayer at this point, as I am having too much fun with the random maps to try them yet.  I totally recommend this game if you like Civ games and myth-related turn based strategies.			"

												So, i nominated this game for some Steam Award and now i have to write a review for 25XP. Deal with it! Still, i'm going to write a full review as someone wo has nearly 400 hours in Age of Wonder 2: Shadowmagic, and... well, a lot less hours in Civ 5.So what is Age of Wonders 3?Age of Wonders 3 is a turn based Strategy game strongly focused around combat, in a pretty standard fanatasy setting. You have elfs, orcs, goblins, halflings and some more unique races like fronstlings and draconians for example. You play as a highly customizable wizard, learning spells and taking over cities, you can upgrade to build stronger and more units, either by producing them in the cities or summoning them with magic.You have multiple classes for your wizard, that kind of work based on the rock paper scissors principle.You'll be able to recruit heros, who can cast some spells as well, and whom you can level up and equip, just like your wizard. Unlike in the previous Age of Wonders game you have the option for your heroes, that if they die in battle, they'll still life on afterwards, unless you lose the bettle entirely. But then you can just resurrect them, using a spell, everyone gets sooner or later. This makes things much less frustrating for those who wish so.The other big new thing in AoW3 is flanking. In AoW2 you could come in with a few string units and just ♥♥♥♥ up a whole army of individualy weaker units with ease, unless you enemie had a big defensive advantage. Flanking gives you new tactical method to make your numbers count, if used well, and it makes some stealthy units more viable, by focusing their skills on this tool, not just having invisibility or concealment on the worldmap.Yes, there is a worldmap and a ""new"" map for each battle. Playing CIV5 after AoW is the least satisfying thing in regards of combat ever. It's like playing ludo after falling in love with chess. You can fire with archers or priests from the top of your city wall, while the enemie sends massive wallbreakers to tear down your gates. Meanwhile his flying unity just pass the wall, trying to take out your raged units. As your last archer dies you cast a massive firestorm for lots of damage on every unit on the battlefield, including your own ones. This is combat.Now there are some cons i'll have to point out.First of all i am not a fan of the campain. As much as i'd like to play it, the missions are just annoying to me. I can't really explayin why, sorry. But i've never liked the campain in any AoW game, while there are many others who loved them. So most of the time i'm just playing randoms maps.The second thing i'd like to point out is a point that occurs in every round i'm playing. It's the point where you are (if you're winning) reaching superiority in a game it becomes boring. They implemented the option for leaders to surrender to you, which i really appreciate, but if you play a 4-player match and took over the cities of 2 of them already, the last enemie is pretty boring to defeat most of the times. That's why i rarely ever finish a game.The third thing are the difficulty settings for the AI. The AI cheats on higher difficulties. They get way more resources, combat bonuses agains independent units, like for example a group of dwarfs protecting a mine, and other stuff. That's not a good way to create difficulty in my opinion.And at last the DLC problem. No, i think the pricing is ok, but i also think they are mandatory for a good experience. The base game just feeld a bit empty.But now a quick sum up of all the great stuff, and belive me, there is a lot!The combat is great, and if your Army of Angels has to fight a pack of wolves you can just let the battle fight out automatically. The new class-system is a welcoming difference. The environment looks gorgeous, even on (most) random generated maps. I still prefer the soundtrack of AoW2 but it's still great in AoW3. Never had any problems with online play. The spells are great. The customization options for the leaders give a lot of variety and a lot of different options for tactics.To sum it up.Age of Wonders 3 is a great turn based game that lacks the economical complexity of games like Civ, but provides a superior tactical combat experience in a good looking fantasy setting.8,9/10 because i can play as a goblin druid and it's great!

												I'm going to just address the top 3-4 negative reviews.Most of those seem to come from players who are not used to the Age of Wonders franchise, people who come from other 4x games like Total War or Civ (But mostly Civ).I understand that you find the game ""lack-luster"" or ""lacking in depth"" in comparison to Civ. Truth be told, I agree with you there. But the game makes for it in THE BEST way by being 5x more in depth than Civ in combat. Civ combat has got to be one of the most boring things that have turned me away from the game. Purely, if I were to play it for economic, diplomatic, and technological victories then Civ would be my ideal game.However, let's be real here we want to fight. We want to see Elven Arrows blasting holy damage into undead and dealing critical damage that sends zombies flying. We want to see Frostling Mammoth charging into a line of human swordsmen and send them packing or frozen solid from wizard buffs. Isn't that more interesting then your typical ""right click this group because hey scissors beats paper.""The hero customization is pretty damn interesting, while you maybe thinking: ""There are only a few options in the beginning what are you talking about?"" The true customization begins when you are leveling up on the campaign map where you can allocate stats, and new skills unlock the higher level you are. These are all incredibly unique.AND NOW THERE IS MODDING. So even if the core selling points didn't get you (Which if they didn't you've got quite a boring taste for video games, I'm sorry) The community has made re-skin mods, unleashed whole new races, created ridiculous legendary nits for your favorite races, and more.If you're a fan of Age of Wonders, just get the game. I usually wait for it to be on sale to buy games anyway since 30$ is a little high, but it was worth it when I got it. If you're a fan of Civ games but want to take a break, THEN TAKE A BREAK. This game IS NOT CIV. It has MUCH higher emphasis on military campaigns and military strategy, and MUCH less on building/economic strategy that Civ excels at. Don't get me wrong, I understand why Civ is a success, but this game is NOT civ so stop comparing the two, lol.			"

												If you have played the past installments of the series, here's a brief overview. First of all, this is definitely AoW as we knew and loved it. Game mechanics is closer to AoW2/SM than it is to AoW1 - there are domains, you don't need siege units to take out walled cities (tho they help), lots of various buildings with a tree of what is needed for what, can build settlers and found cities etc. Overall I'd say changes to core mechanics compared to SM are relatively minor, and focus mainly on tactical combat, where we now have flanking and a more clear mechanics for ranged shots. All in all, if you liked AoW series, and especially AoW:SM, highly recommended. Personally, I still think AoW1 is the best of them all, but this one is still plenty of fun. Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome and very much reminiscent of the very first game.If you haven't played AoW before, but remember the name ""Master of Magic"", then you can basically think of this as a remake of MoM. Again, if you liked that game, you will probably like this.If neither of those ring a bell, the short way to describe this would be Civilization crossed with Heroes of Might and Magic, with some special uniqueness of its own.The Civilization part is the global map where you capture and/or build cities, manage them to grow their population, build various buildings that improve growth/production/gold/mana/research or produce units, and research spells and special abilities. There's also a HoMM-esque aspect to it as the map is littered with loot and special gold/mana/research producing buildings, typically guarded by NPC mobs. However, unlike HoMM, the global gameplay is definitely geared more towards city management.When it comes to combat, you can either auto-resolve it, or go into tactical mode like HoMM. Now the big difference here is that, where HoMM is basically two armies of 6 unlimited stacks of units battling on a very small map lined against each other, in AoW you get the combat map produced out of the hex that's being attacked (on the global map), plus the six hexes surrounding it - and all the armies on them! Each army consists of up to 6 units (which CANNOT be stacked), and can technically belong to a different player, or independent mobs (some of which will fight each other). So you can have up to 42 independent units in combat, controlled by anywhere from 2 to 7 players, and with a large combat map which presents plenty of opportunity for maneuver - flanking, retreating to form a line etc are all very common here and have to be learned to fight efficiently, plus the terrain is full of buildings, trees and other obstacles that can be used as cover or to break up enemy line. Consequently, battles typically last longer than in HoMM, especially large city sieges, and are far more tactically challenging - superiority in numbers by no means ensures victory.Another HoMM-like-but-better thing is hero and leader development. You get the usual system with hero classes, experience points accumulating from kills etc, invested into various skills and traits. There is inventory, too, to be filled by loot from various ruins after evicting their occupants. All in all, this is a solid high fantasy 4X game that is rather engaging and a lot of fun.			"

												Age of Wonders 3, what can I say that hasn't already been said. I am a late convert to the game. The original release didn't inspire me. The Golden Realms expansion, though great, didn't interest me. The hype of Eternal Lords got me to look and it's implementation got me to stay and play. A fantastic fantasy war game that reminds me a lot of Warhammer Fantasy Battle, AoW 3 is a fantastically fun battle simulator. Is it a perfect game? No. It has some shortcomings, but it's getting better all the time. My favorite Race are the Tigrans; fast, blood thirsty and feline. My favorite specilization: Arch Druid because of the summons and the cool units.Least favorite.. BONE DRAGONS!!!!!Anyways, to get more, come check out our official review at eXplorminate4x.com "

												The AI cheats like crazy in this game.There is no way around it. The AI seems to know EVERY LOCATION that is UNGUARDED. I have tested it by having 6 cities. Whenever I remove a garrison from one, the AI will go there. It's immensely frustrating that after saving and loading 6 times, the AI still does this, and there is no way that I can proceed.Overall, since the AI will be our core opponent unless in multiplayer, I don't recommend this game at all if you wish to fight against a cheating AI.

												I played part 1 & 2 of this back when they were new so I was very much looking forward to the new one. It didn't disappoint.The game looks quite beautiful. The basic game mechanics are still the same so if you have played the old games you will feel right at home again. There are lots of different units and strategies you can use. Combat is fun and complex. The story is pretty run of the mill but good enough to glue the maps together.The game is well supported with patches and expansions.Well worth playing.			"

												This game is exactly what I\'ve been looking for: a decent fantasy strategy game.I do have some slight issues:1. Needs more Navy. I love naval combat. It\'s adds a different layer into the strategy game and makes it more interesting and challenging. Unfortunately there are only two fleet options in AoW: the frigate and the galleon.2. I\'ve found the Tigrans to be slightly OP. I started a game with Cerren and have tier I & II units just walking effortlessly over tier IV and higher units. Are they OP or an I just better with the Tigrans than I am with other races?3. Sorcerers feel slightly OP. Sorcerers. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing sorcerers! They start of weak then suddenly BAM! Unstoppable. But I can\'t judge AoW for that. They\'ve always been like that.3. Why don\'t assassins have throwing knives? Assassins without throwing knives or shuriken is like waffles without maple syrup.What I love:1. The tactics. Having to take into consideration race, class, morale, climate, terrain, and all these factors makes this game pretty damn sweet. I know it\'s not really a new concept, but it\'s a good one.2. The world is beautiful.3. The characters are beautiful.4. I can customise my own heroes.5. It saves after every turn, which is great if something goes wrong, like a blackout or a crash.All in all I like this game a lot.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is perhaps the best in the series thus far.  The best features being the extensive random game generator and the capabilities of hot-seat multi-player.  That being said, for those who are wanting a good single player srategy game, it fits that bill as well.  Though I have seen repeated unit selections, there is enough variation to edge you towards creating multiple heroes just to see what build fits your concept best.  The music has changed in pace from being dreamy to driven synth orchestra... and boasts a great selection of tracks.  The digital soundtrack package included 36 tracks, plus all the cd case art.  If you are looking for a good strategy game by which you can take your own pace, dab into some light rpg elements, and team up with (or betray) a buddy... you have found it.  Previous fans should rejoice. Others, well, welcome to the club.  Oh yeah... don't forget the perks of the included map editor.			"

												The best turn-based strategy since Heroes of Might and Magic III. Prepare to invest heavy amounts of hours into the campaign and barely have even explored what the rest of the game has on offer. The AI offers a decent challenge that will keep you interested for a while to come, and the combat system has enough depth to bring along a few surprises each match. Look no further if you are after a polished strategy game that will keep you thinking and offers some nice fantasy elements to boot.			"

												I've never played an Age of Wonders game before.  I played Civ V however, and this game is similar in a lot of ways. Basically, imagine Civ V but with less to do with science and diplomatic options and more just combat, combat combat.  Throw in some Final Fantasy Tactics for manual combat (there's an auto resolve button if you choose not to) and you have a steller game.   I originally wrote this game off as I figured all my friends playing it would move on shortly after.  Now I can see why they are so into it.  It has plenty of depth for replayability. Whether you want a rogueish goblin who is adept at fire, or a theocratic orc who uses kindness, it's all up to you.  Pick this♥♥♥♥♥♥up.  If you are on the fence, just jump.  I did, and I don't regret it.			"

												While not exactly revolutionary at any given aspect, the unique combination presented in the gameplay plus the fact that it is fairly well-made make for a worthwhile experience if you are into this sort of thing. It's a fantasy turn-based civ-style game, which is not something you really see a lot of. The campaign leaves much to be desired, the gameplay isn't perfect, and sure, I'd like a little more from the customization options, but this game does a lot of things competently so I can't ask it to be perfect at everything. If you want just an rpg to customize characters, this isn't it. If you want your hero to also lead armies in your growing civilization in a fantasy world, this satisfies that. There's also a map/scenario editor. You'll have to look up how to do scripting if you want to be fancy with it, but the map editor itself is fairly easy and well-done.			"

												I was a big fan of Age of Wonders II and Age of Wonders II:  Shadow Magic so it is natural like I would like AoW III.  This turn-based strategy game with a fantasy theme is sort of a mix between Heroes of Might & Magic and Civilization.  At least for me, I like AoW best of all.  I love the hero units in this game and the way they level, have items/mounts, and can use spells.  I love that there is incentive to level and grow even the normal units as their stats get better and they may get additional abilities at higher levels.  I love being able to choose what each city is producing whether it be units or some building that will give that city an ability or boost.  AoW III does not have the race and unit variety that AoW II:  Shadows Magic had but they keep adding races and whatnot via expansions so maybe it will get there eventually.I like the single-player campaigns thus far but there are some things that bother me.  First, sometimes the missions force you to be very aggressive in order to win.  If you are too slow then the AI can wipe you out or at least make the mission drag out way longer than it should take.  Second, I love to focus on leveling my heroes and the campaign missions usually have a hero level cap that gets higher as you get deeper into a campaign.  I understand the reasoning for that but my interest drops when I can't grow my heroes anymore.  The best part about the campaigns is that you get to keep your heroes mission to mission.  All their XP and items and skill points remain.  There is a caveat though but I'm not sure how much I should say about it since it could be a story spoiler.I have about 80 hours played thus far and I haven't even finished the first out of four single-player campaigns (I think the base game comes with 2 campaigns and the expansions add more).  I am definitely getting my money's worth.  Even if/when I finish all the campaigns I can easily create scenarios against AIs or players where I control the map size and whatnot (a la Civilization).  That is what I often did on AoW II.This is not a game I will play all the time but I will always come back to it periodically where I get all excited about it once again and sink a lot of time into it for at least a couple weeks.

												Pros and cons at the bottomshort version:This game is the best turn based strategy game i have ever played (i have played a lot of them). I have hundreds of hours in offline play on this one. If you like fully customizable heroes (very very customizable, almost rpg like), deep tech trees and xp earning units that end up forming an elite guard in your army or gets thrown away as cannon fodder just to be replaced with more, then this game is a must. Graphics are good, gameplay is very good and music is absolutely excellent.Longer version:This just might be the best turn based strategy game of all time, rivalling the likes of Heroes of might and magic 3 and warlords 2. AOW series can be described as being a mix of those two games series as this game features city specific tech trees, hero classses and races, fully customizeable heroes, global and tactical spells, xp for all units and heroes, income and upkeep, tactical battles, heroless armies, quests, random events and the list goes on for pages. The campaign story rocks from the very first game in the series and no less in the last. Scenarios feel like mini campaings and the map generator works very well. Races and classes have clear different feels to them and are well balanced with the option to build some badass heroes and armies.An example is the match between the rogue class and the dreadnaught class, one is based on nimble movement and cruel backstabs while the other is based on mass destruction by steamdriven warmachines. The AOE from the dreadnaughts death macines would prove unbeatable for the light, but fast rogue units if not for their scoundrels ability to sprint through the incoming fire and sabotage those same engines causing tremendous damage. There is no such thing as a fair fight against a rogue and so such thing as a casualty free battle against dreadnaughts.This is an immersive fantasy strategy game with deep tactics and rock, paper, scissor counters with near endless options for combination and no two games need look alike. The fantasy setting and campaing story with a red line going from the very first release in the series to the last of the DLC (which btw is well worth the purchase on sale if youre short on cash). Your hero pick up where you left him in every mission of the campaign making you increasingly badass and without any linear progression as it is entirely up to the player how to build him or her.Pros:-Game is awesome-Very good campaigns with thorough and exciting tutorial elements in the start-Turnbased with simultaneous play options with the turn ending when all players press end-Music (really).-You will never try all combinations of races, classes and hero skills nor will you want to stop trying.-So customizable that style and taste comes into play.-Deep morale system and buff/debuff.-Alignment (good/evil/neutral) is earned in every game by actions.-Unit alignments.-Race relations and specific faction relations also mostly earned.-Can be played in ""simple"" mode by making easy setups and disabling things.-Great campaign with red line from the very first game, without it being a requirement that you have played the earlier games.-Very dynamic once you get the hang of how to do things properly.-The little things does matter, they make up the balance which allows deeper undestanding for better tactics.-Has settler mode with empty maps where the empires have to be built from scratch.-Have a ton of modes and random events and basically endless things that can make every single game significantly different even on the same map.-Sometimes trying that thing you didnt think worked turns out to work very well and continues to surprise and reward creativity-Has many good scenarios which play out like small campaigns-Classes and races have very different, but balanced, strengths allowing any well executed approach to work effectively.Cons:-Very large maps can accumulate a little too much management for some peoples taste, though it can be circumvented by teching and planning well (making 5 dragons instead of 50 footmen, less units is less management).-Did not release a sequel the minute i finished the campaign (making me wait, like why?)-Can be confusing if you try to understand everything at first, play the first campaign first which turns this into a pro-Some classes like Rogue or Sorceror/Sorceress can be a hazzle to fight if you dont force the fight onto your terms and instead let them harass you, this can be a pro if you like being that one ;)			"

If you know how to play MoM, you won't even need the tutorial.Which is fine. I loved Master of Magic. The graphics are much better, and there are a lot of improvements in the way your various campaigns can be set up. You've got adjustable victory conditions, more players if you want them, and you can ally with independent cities for starters. This game is well worth picking up if you like 4x.			"

												I was pleasantly surprised and impressed when I picked up Age of Wonders III.  A fantasy 4X strategy game is something that will always catch my eye though the genre has disappointed me quite frequently lately.  Fortunately, this particular one nearly flawlessly pulls off what I would expect and lived up to its potential.  This is a fantasy conquest game with a sizable helping of RPG that you don't want to miss.The map aspect of the game is fairly simple, though it has enough to it to keep it interesting.  There are plenty of landmarks, cities, and dungeons scattered about and, usually, plenty of space for you to construct new cities and fortresses if you so choose.  Cities can be improved with buildings to assist in growing their populations, boosting their economies, enhancing their defenses, training units, and more.  Though empire management is nowhere near as deep as something akin to Civilization, I never found myself feeling as if anything additional was needed for this particular game.  It is, after all, a conquest game, not an empire builder.Combat, on the other hand, is where the game truly stands out.  Battles take place on a zoomed in map that is generated based on the features of the terrain being defended.  The turn-based tactical engagements can involve a large number of units and, at times, a single battle can take over twenty minutes.  The AI is no joke in this game and can provide a legitimate opponent which is a breath of fresh air.  Progression for you units and heroes is also an exciting aspect of Age of Wonders III.  When a hero levels, they acquire five skill points that they can purchase skills with.  These skills are from a non-linear tree that is specific to their class.  When a unit levels, it generally gains only stat bonuses, though every unit in the game has at least one unique ability that it can acquire once the required experience has been gained.  The system offers a lot of customization for your hero builds but also manages to make leveling your non-unique units fun as well.Playing one of the campaigns in the game offer unique goals and a decently written story, though, they do limit your power over the customization of your heroes.  You are supplied with several heroes that are characters within the story who will take turns acting as the 'leader' of your faction on certain maps.  It is an excellent way to get a grasp of the game and the differing races and classes in a way that dips your toes in slowly instead of hopping in head first.  Your heroes will also carry over from map to map giving them the opportunity to reach levels that would be hard to obtain in scenario play.When playing a scenario, you are able to design your leader from the ground up.  This includes they and their army's race, the hero's class and specializations, and even the appearance of your hero themselves.  There are a fairly significant number of each and you could spend all day deciding which combination you want to play with.  Do you want to play an orcish archdruid and have your melee powerful units complemented by summoned nature-themed units?  Or do you want to play an elven engineer who has their line of dangerous elven archers aided by cannons and musketeers?  The combinations are a lot of fun and the class specific units have different unit models for every race.If you couldn't tell by this point, I am quite a fan of Age of Wonders III.  It successfully fills a void that I'd felt in my soul time after time playing the games that were 'inspired' by Master of Magic but couldn't quite hit the mark.  I highly recommend this game for turn-based strategy fans, especially those who are also fans of high fantasy.Raise your sword, ready your staff, load your musket, sharpen your claws and conquer these lands for yourself!

												One of my favorite games on steam!Prepare to be sucked in with Age of Wonders 3.  An amazing turn based strategy game that will continue to hold your attention and WOW you with attention to detail, depth and rich battles.The game features a series of campaigns with different routes, fun hand crafted scenarios and a random map generator with different modes to play.You pick a race/class/specializations which are all interesting, fun and create different synergies.Orc warlord? Human Dreadnaught? Elven sorcerer?, Goblin Archdruid Specializing in water magic to create a swampy empire?You name it! the combinations are plenty!Each race starts off with a variety of units that for the most part fill common roles,Infantry, Archer, Pikeman, Cavalry, flyers, and support.  All these units per race ARE UNIQUE and different, it just might not appear that way on the surface. Orcs are great at melee, elves great with archers etc.Classes affect your spells in and out of combat, and units that you get.Terrain/weather affect.  Your leader and Heroes units level up and can customized.Units can level up.Different sub factions that can be conquered and used to your advantage. Like dragons and giants.I can go on and on but the combinations and situations to be in are plenty and it never gets dull.MUST PLAY! 9/10			"

												If you were ever a fan of the old games, make no mistake, this is a perfect sequel for the franchise.Having grown up playing the first three Age of Wonders games, it's hard to say in words exactly how excited I was in the lead up to this game coming out. I was worried in part by how it seemed as if your class defined the vast majority of your army but, having finally gotten the chance to play, all my fears from watching the previews have been quenched. This game feels exactly like AoW2/SM in all the right ways; next to nothing was removed mechanically and the new class and neutral city systems are simply additions, not replacements, to the old ways and they blend in perfectly.While it seems weird to review a game less than a day after having first played it, you should understand that I am the kind of gamer who will play a game I adore for only an hour per day when I'm ""into it"" and yet, with AoW3, I haven't been able to put it down. The sense of adventure and discovery I've found playing this game is unmatched, though I admit I'm looking at it through rose-coloured glasses. It really feels like a fresh take on the series, and the genre as a whole, without seeming too attached or too spiteful towards its predecessors.It is not a flawless game by any means. I've found numerous graphic and sound bugs in the time I've been playing with some battle map terrain acquiring a strobe effect and a few attack sound effects simply missing in the ether. The map generator is still somewhat flawed, leaving a suspicious trail of grass along the edges of some maps and awkwardly placing patches of water in giant lava pools. My first encounter with an NPC in a match had me face to face with the character I had just created minutes before and was currently playing, turning the war into what looked more like bickering twins. These issues to hinder on the immersion quite a bit and hopefully they will be patched in time but it's never enough to make the game any less fun. What DOES make the game less fun is how suicidal the AI is when trying to rely on auto-combat, which is mostly a problem in multiplayer as not using auto-combat takes up a lot of time from everyone involved.Tactical combat is, in my opinion, far more intricate and engaging as any of the older titles. The simple addition of the flanking and defending mechanic, as well as the reworking of the accuracy systems, was enough to vastly increase the depth of the combat but the sheer number of new units and abilities added on top of what we're already used to is almost overwhelming and it makes combat much more surprising, adaptive and satisfying.The reworked city system is a rather significant departure from the originals and is what leads many to believe it's taken too much inspiration from Civilization. Having played Civ 5 to death as well, I can say the change does feel more in line with Civilization than the previous Age of Wonders games but it's very unintrusive and comes with a purpose. Now you have to be careful about where and how you place your cities because their growth (and, by extension, they effectiveness) is inhibated by whatever borders surround them and the structures nearby have significant rewards attached whereas, in the older games, you would place cities as close as possible because more cities just meant more gold, no more thought involved. Here, cities hold a much more strategic purpose and can lead to epic battles fought over one mostly unimpressive city just because it has a structure you want in its domain. It's exciting and thought provoking and feels natural in the evolution of the series.Overall, I love this game. I don't think it's an easy game to get into but it's clearly a game made with their fans in mind and is completely unapologetic about that. If you ever felt the other Age of Wonders game appealed to you before, chances are you will love this new installment. As a child of the AoW era, I can honestly say this has turned out to be everything I have hoped for for the past 11 years.			"

												This game has the best combat system out of all the 4x games I have played. Rather than watching your army play an attacking animation against the enemy on the map like in most 4x games, you are transported to a seperate battle map. In this battle are the units of the attacking army, the defending army, and any adjacent armies, for a total of up to 42 units. There are lots of unique units with unique spells and abilities. The combat is very strategic, you have to think about how you position your units to flank your enemy and not leave them vulnerable to be flanked by the enemy.The empire building isn't as in-depth as other 4x games though. This game is focused more on your hero, whom you can level up and acquire new armor, weapons, spells and abilities for. You can also recruit other heros to join you. This is one of my favourite 4x games and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for one with a more engaging combat system than most other 4x games.			"

												Short review: 596 hours. Um, yeah.Longer review: If you were ever a fan of classic turn based strategy games like Heroes I-IV, you'll love AoW III. Much more than the recent Civilization games, it has that ""just one more turn..."" feel that will cut into your sleep time. Beautiful graphics, easy to learn and use UI and excellent mod support that adds even more depth to an already deep game.The only real negative is that the expansions really are required to get the most out of the game, especially the one that adds necromancers and a lot of other fun stuff. A number of the really excellent mods also require the expansions, beware. "

												I just completed my first campaign and my god was it fun. Finally realizing that I got gods as my late game unit, I was finally able to overwhelm my opponent. This game scales amazingly though the game with spells that can be cast in and out of combat, upgradeable equipment, quests and dungeons. This game has everything!			"

												A wonderful game!This is what Heroes of Might and Magic 5,6 and 7 should have been like! Clearly developed to beat these titles and it succeeds I think!Essentially Age of Wonders III is HOM&M but with far superior combat, tactics, spells, heroes and troop development.The graphics are as good as later HOM&M titles but the 3D used here seems to work so much better than HOM&M I feel, the interface is also more intuitive. Though I loved Heroes of Might and Magic 1 to 4 I could never get used to the later version's interface but AOWIII improves on them greatly in almost all aspects. The one small issue with it is that the maps, at least in the Scenario's, do not seem quite as heavy on resources and independant enemies as HOM&M games but I guess this is because the game is trying to break away slightly here.I will also say, it's HARD! I like this but was continually getting my backside kicked until I realise how much effect terrain variations had on different troops types! I love this and it really distinguishes it from HOM&M games where morale was a simple mechanism. AOWIII brilliantly bridges the gap between HOM&M and a more traditional squad/unit-based wargame.Think of a cross between HOM&M and Warhammer and you are just about there :)			"

												This is the first game I have bought in this series, I was drawn to it because I love the Heros might and magic games. Age of Wonders III has so much more going on, it will be hard going back to HMM games. You have populations to increase, the tiles on the map can change over time. (from barren land to a forest if you choose) There are preset cities but those can be destroyed and new cities built where you please. Great options in this game!			"

												****Edit on Feb 2015****Purchased and played Golden Realm DLC...ExcellentPro 's-3 part Campaign with storyboard and voice acting, extra gametypes, leaders, units, etc.-Game seems much more balanced and only crashed once on a custom scenario.Con's-I use to be able to host internet games but now you get a connectivity rating and if it is poor you are   not allowed to host game although you can still join them.  (Nothing in my hardware setup has changed, so one of the later game patches must have implemented this.)-though they have done balancing to the game, I still found myself having to reload ingame saves while playing on the easiest skill level.In all I'm moving my rating up to a 9.April 7 2014My review for the 4x, fantasy genre, strategy game called Age of Wonders III.   I had high hopes for this title, as these types of games seem to be few and far between, especially when it come to the game raising the bar and setting a standard for its genre.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  Lets break it down:Graphics: 8 Graphics had lots of detail, varied terrain types and meshes that blended well. Music/Sound Effects/Voice acting 8.5Had a great musical score, character acting was top notch, sound effects and environmentals were good too.Controls 8Controls are actually good.  Small issue with some poorly placed, floating info boxes that interfere with selection choices for hero skills. Gamplay 8This could have been so much higher.  The good part is content: 2 campaigns, each with 2 different endings.  I have put about 50 hours into the first campaign finishing off both endings.  With still another campaign left, it seems there is alot of content to keep you immersed.  The game also features a multiplayer/co op multiplay option (and it aint ""hotseat"").  You can now finally battle it out, with or against your friends, in a 4x game turnbased strategy game.  The bad part is there are some issues.  I started the campaign on normal difficulty and after two or three maps I had to change the setting to easy.  On easy settings it got just as difficult and impossible to complete the last 2 maps without dying a couple dozen times and having to reload the game.  Multiplayer also has issue, infrequent game hangs, and the more frequent friend dropped from game issue.  However, the game allows you to continue with an ai friend or save the game and reload and have your friend rejoin.  Nothing gamebreaking, just a minor annoyance.Overall 8Final thoughtsTriumph Studio was very attentive and  helpful with any issues on launch day.  There are obvious issues that they have noted and promised a quick patch for.  I take it as a good sign if they start pumping out patches before DLC for their game.  There are also gamers who feel the game lacks customization of units or this and that.  I personally feel we have been flooded with sandbox type games, and it has become an expectation that we should be able to create our own game, with the game you give us.  You can create your own custom hero and there is a map maker/editor I have yet to mess with.  With all this to consider, the game doesn't lack, but as any game, can always be improved upon.  Let Triumph get on with the bug fixing, and be patient for the additional content that they promise to work on and deliver.  The game is complete as is and will most likely go down in history as a ""classic"".			"

												A fantastic strategy game that will appeal to anyone who loves the genre. The game is a 4X similar to Civilization and Master of Magic, but it takes heavy cues from Heroes of Might and Magic in that the world is littered with goodies thrown about to plunder and neutral enemies guarding them, as well as customisable hero units that you can recruit and level. The best thing about it though, is the tactical battle system. This is nothing new, as Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, as well as the original Age of Wonders games, all did this a long time ago, but here it feels so refined. Terrain has a big impact, units have cool active and passive abilities, and the strategic choices that you make in battle all feel meaningful. On top of this, the game has great variety. Not only do you have a selection of races to choose, all with their own tech trees and units, but you also have character classes and traits to choose for your leader. Your leader's class and traits will determing what extra special units you can produce, as well as the spells you have access to. The combination of both race and class makes mixing and matching fun to do, and allows you to have much more variety if you get bored of a certain setup, yet still like certain elements of your previous games. The expansions are absolutely worth it if you enjoy the game already. The Necromancer class added by Eternal Lords is amazingly fun, and plays entirely differently than the other classes, with a much more agressive play style that emphasises growing your cities and armies through combat. Over all, Age of Wonders III is one of the best in the genre to date.			"

												I never heard of this game till now. I am a big on this type game mechanics. This game is similar to Civilization with it's turn based style. I'll add a plus on Manual Battle scenario. Although this is my first time playing an Age of Wonders game I can seem myself playing future series. Pros - Like Civilization  - Manual Combat ""as a plus that civ doesn't have"" - Interesting Leaders - Mixed Racial Empire ""Different types of units"" ~well races* - AI don't declare war on you just becauseCons - Requires an account to play online -_- - City Management isn't all to work with - Cities don't have defense protection like civ - Research is pretty wack ""Seems plain""People may diss me, but civ is the only game I can compare this with. Continuing on,  this game is worth playing and I'd recommend this to people who enjoy turn base games and sorts.			"

												This game is absolutely the Real Deal.  A friend and I was a big fan of the Civilization games because we could play together easily and seemlessly, and when we bought this we were a little unsettled at first because we thought it was too good to be true.  15-16 hours later I can honestly say this is one of the finest CO OP, Grand Strategy, RPG games I've ever touched.  So many game elements, unreal replayability, great depth and this isnt even counting possible DLCs in the future.  You'll EASILY get your money's worth in this jewel.			"

												Age of Wonders III is already a very in depth and well made title. With Eternal Lords thrown into the mix. It just seems even better. This title has a laundry list of features, game modes, and more. Going through all the aspects of the game will take you easily more then a hundred hours to fully assimilate. To break it down, Age of Wonders III is a mixture of Civ meets Masters of Magic. You will bring your spell-flinging champion into the fray against other champion leaders. The empire aspects compliment your hero. This 4X title has more of a focus on individual heroes and tactical combat. Ordering your troops around the map isn't enough in this title. You must command them in battle as well. While the combat is optional, to fully experience this title I would suggest it. Simply put Age of Wonders III: Eternal Lords is an impressive accomplishment. For such a small studio. Graphics, music, and design are all top notch here. The only true complaint one could form is the price. While it can be a bit pricey. You will be playing one map for hundreds of turns and then there is there multiplayer, The level editor, and more. Bang for your buck is guaranteed. Along as you enjoy the genre.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												This game is great. I really like that the developers chose the right path, they not only did not move towards contraction but instead they actually introduced lots of new features into the game, which was very risky in the first place, knowing how conservative are fans in such games like AOW, Disciples and HMM. But in reality, compared to Heroes of Might and Magic and especially Disciples, which both went the wrong direction, this game is a masterpiece.The new added features make the game different on the one hand, but also more interesting. I do not want to compare this game to Age of Wonders II, which of course is a living classics, but I can tell that this game has set the bar very high. This is obvious when you look at everything - the picture is amazing, it creates an impression of a beautiful fantasy world - very often I stopped the game in order to look at the map, take a look at the river, mountains, forests, and to look at how my pocket kingdom is doing. The music is great, altough I always consider the Age of Wonders II contained the best soundtrack of all times in games, the compositions of Michiel van den Bos are very powerful, and are used when they are actually needed, very often giving an additional inspiration in difficult battles.I think the best argument which summarizes overall impression of the game is that there is always a wish to let the game go even when the map is already won. This is paradoxical on the one hand, because each map takes very long time to beat, but it was always a part of Age of Wonders gameplay, and compared to the previous games, in my opinion, it feels way faster. There are always so many things to do, do some research, build more buildings, recruit more units, build improvements, and to build new cities... So sometimes I regret that there is no single unified map like it is in Civilization, where you could develop a huge Empire and allow it to stand the test of time - this is perhaps the only bad thing about this game.8.5 / 10			"

												I wish I knew about this game sooner. It incorporates features from Civilization, Total War, and XCOM in a turn-based format.=========================================Pros:I'm just playing single-player so far, but I'm loving the RPG elements of leveling your leader and troops.You can research spells which you can use to cast spells in combat (buffing troops, damaging enemies, etc), or cast spells outside of combat (damaging enemy armies, buffing your cities, etc.)Sieges are well done as far as giving the defender a big advantage, but still making siege weapons useful. Not enough games use these mechanics properly.Each race has it's own pros and cons, and each leader has their own spells and stats, some of which you can influence when they level up. There is a custom leader creator as well which is pretty cool.Great value. Got this game on a -66% Steam sale, absolutely worth the price. Only bought the base game, but in the first hour realized I would enjoy it enough to buy the whole package.=============================================ConsThere is a lot of micro-management, but it's turn-based and similar to Civilization. So if Civ was overwhelming, this may not be the game for you.Battles can be a little tedious because you move and attack with every unit. Also most units have their own spells and ranks, so it's not too horrible. I'm not disliking combat yet, but I can see where some might. There is an auto-resolve option like Total War though.Edit for multiplayer review; highly not recommended. You have to watch every battle as other players complete their battles. There is auto-resolve, but this game is all about tactical battles and it's unplayable like that. However, there is play-by-email and that works fine, so if you don't mind doing that, then it's do-able. Really disappointing, but it's because of gameplay balance. =================================================All in all, if you enjoy Civilization, XCOM, or Total War, then you would probably enjoy this game.Also, that guy who has 100 hours played and still didn't recommend this game, stop being so entitled. That's a great value.			"

Sure - why not.  I also like how your actions directly affect your alignment which affects diplomacy.Not sure why so many people are angry about the online sign-in thing.  There is a big checkbox on the front page that says ""Play offline/guest account"".  I have played for 4 hours and haven't even signed up yet.Also - the level editor looks pretty damned meaty - once people start cracking it open it will be interesting to see what it can d.			"

												I am having fun. There are a few known issues like pop up screens not appearing at higher resolutions, but nothing game breaking.This is my first AOW game and I like how it reminds me of HOMM3 with playable leveling equipable heroes that can participate (and die) in combat.It has a large leveling and upgradable creature base, a decent town system that allows captured towns to be plundered and adapted to your culture group.The maps are beautiful, hex based, allowing up to 5 adjacent stacks to reinforce and participate in battles.There is an extensive tome (encyclopedia) that is a boon to players providing whatever knowledge you need to learn about playing the game.The campaign is well voice acted, has a decent storyline and a good interface.Overall I am happy with this purchase so far and am looking forward to playing all the types, maps, etc. with my friends.

												At the writing of this review I have just finished one random map on normal difficulty. I had a lot of fun with this game but there are a few things you should know before buying it.This game excel with its tactical combats and it does it very well.  And the game is developed as a war game and the developers made this game around this concept, and you should accept this game as it is, a war game, where you need to carefully maneuver your units on a battle field behind covers, flanking enemies, exploiting enemy's weakness (elemental, armour, speed etc), and the game does it really well, and the ai is also very well done which employ a variety of tactics and is challenging even on normal.Now about what this game isn't. It is not a sophisticated empire builder like Civilization. In fact, because the game is so build around the tactical combats, the designers want you to intelligently maneuver your troops tactically, that you simply cannot win by strategic planning alone. There are no super units that you can simply steam roll through your foes. There are no super spells that will wipe out an entire stack of enemy on the tactical map. It is even hard to win by economy alone because even with one city you can produce a quite powerful army, on standard map the resources are so aboundant that you simply cannot starve a city out.Some people criticize the game because it is not what they expected, a fantasy Civilization game, and you should accept this game as it is, a very well done tactical war game. I really love the presentation of this game, both the visual arts and music are full of imagination and epic. I did encounter a few freezes although they are relatively rare. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.			"

That being said, this game adds its own type of variety with the leader classes, and the game provides a very solid turn based gameplay. The combat is involved, and your leader is an active participant in your conquest. In alot of ways, this game is more akin to a sequel of Age of Wonders 1, than it is a sequel to the more widely popular, AoW: SM. Fun, engaging, and as always, it has the hated feeling of 'one more turn is all I need'.			"

												A fun game which stays true to its precedessors spirit. Although I recommend it hoping it gets better with future balancing patches, this game as of this moment has a huge game balance issue where top tier units are many times stronger than lower tiers without much restraints in place to discourage spamming. Coupled with city build spamming and relatively quick-to-research, cheap, effective spells (like machine in-combat res at only 20 mana cost, really!?), end game becomes boring and tedious.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is definitely the best turn based fantasy Civilization rip-off around. I have a number of competitors and none of them come close to AoW3 in terms of polish, depth, strategy nor fun-level. The learning curve is steep - but you will never feel like your wasting your time.There are a good number of units and races, and then on top of each race is the class, and then the cherry is '13 specialisation trees with Adept / Master grades' (thanks CrUsHeR) so with race and class you end up with like 6² characters, then there is the choice of male or female which doubles that again - this game is huge. Add to that 3 expansions and you're looking at a true Civilization comparable time-waster.Recommended - especially at 20USD / 8.99NZD!			"

												It is time I give this beast a review.I feel very lame about posting this quite a few years after release.Age of Wonders franchise has always been very dear to me since the first iteration.This review is a critic of the current version of the game, including both expansions.Age of Wonders (1), was a magical title. An epic title.Yes, Epic, is pretty much everywhere nowadays, and quite frankly the new epic is quite ♥♥♥♥.Age of Wonders, wasn't that epic, it was Epic. It was Mechanical and yet it was Ethereal It was made of steam and it was made of scales. It was a smile depicting sadness and a cry reminiscent of joy. It was Air, Fire and Water. And it was the Light that casts the Shadow under the bellows of the Earth. It was shaking but it was cooling. It was carved in chants that resonated among impermeable silences, it all belonged to one mystical place. It was built over a valley, and lead only by its very own fantasies: The Valley of Wonder.Because of characters limitation I decided to post the full review there:http://aow.triumph.net/forums/topic/review-in/ "

 Amazing 4X strategy game which provides great tactical battles and huge variety I recommend this game for any 4X fans who enjoy nice tactical battles/huge variation of everything. I really like the design choice which mixes race and class of the main hero, because this helps to create huge variety of combinations (and of course - many different units to choose from). I'm glad that I started playing this game about 6 months after release, because most of annoying bugs and problems were fixed and corrected. After two expansion unit/tactics/spells variation is really amazing. Each game is different from each other. Graphics and sound are also very solid. After this great experience with Age of Wonders III - I am looking forward to see what Triumph Studios will bring next.Thumbs up!!!			"

												This game is a true spiritual successor to Age of Wonders 2 and Shadow Magic that manages to remain true to and enhance on many things that make Shadow Magic such a timeless classic. One great improvement is the new and improved custom wizard creator, which allows you to make really interesting custom characters and save them to use or play against. One of the big changes is the addition of a class system, each wizard chooses one of seven classes, and some of the classes take over the function of some of the old races (Dark Elves, Undead, Archons, Nomads), for example, Rogues build Shadows and Succubi and can do so for any race, and Necromancers can summon or build a lot of the iconic Undead units, as well as ghoul forms of normal racial units.Each of the seven Wizard Classes contain a variety of unique units and spells and can provide unique upgrades to their armies, each of the nine races has several unique units and a few generic units and can build class units for any class that commands them, in addition wizards can choose from several masteries similar to Spheres of Magic in AoW2 and Shadow Magic, each of which have their own spells and upgrades.Now with the recent surge of mods, it's also possible to customize your experience beyond what normal options allow, with mods that range from allowing custom wizards to wear any armor with any class, to more custom colors for wizards, to more powerful terraforming spells.The game has a slightly greater focus on Hero Units than Shadow Magic did, but that can also be configured in settings if you don't like it. However your wizard doesn't have to sit around in a tower and will gain levels like heroes so it's usually a good idea to take it into fights. The Building Selection is mostly just like in AoW 2 with the main focus of the game remaining on exploration and combat. Patches have added buildings based on resources within a city's domain with a variety of effects, such as unlocking special units, or increasing research speeds. A racial governance system has also been added that allows you to select one of two race wide bonuses with each upgrade.The Diplomacy system is improved in many ways over Age of Wonders 2, but compared to games like Civilization 3 it still falls short, it's impossible to threaten and coerce other Wizards, and the AI is usually unwilling to participate in diplomacy unless it fully sets the terms.There are a variety of game modes, including Play by Email. It's possible to play single player, and to my understanding local host multiplayer without creating a Triumph account, so it's not DRM, but be advised that in order to access all of the achievements and some multiplayer modes you may need to create an online account for some of the multiplayer. Multiplayer probably isn't the main reason you'd want to buy this anyway, but it's worth mentioning.Overall, I can't recommend this game enough, it's my all time favorite game,			"

												Age of Wonders III is an charming game but has too much cut and/or unfinished content to recommend, especially to fans of the older titles in this series, both which were filled to the brim with atmosphere.THE GOOD:- MusicInvigorating tunes that spur you on while you play, great remixes of old tracks while adding in a few new ones as well. Most are of great quality but due to the length of some instances (late-game world map micro-managing or lengthy battle sequences with large armies), the themes can seem to reoccur too often too quickly.- Gameplay (Leader vurnability)While defeat could come easily in Age of Wonder 1 when your leader died to a stray spell, Age of Wonders II made them too persistant with next turn revives and respawning at any city with a Wizard's Tower. Age of wonders 3 perfects this balance by granting the leader some form of revival but at a decent cost. All in all: Leaders are neither vurnable nor near-unkillable like they were in previous games, striking the perfect balance where all tactics can be considered during play to eliminate your opponent.THE BAD:- GraphicsWhile city-scapes during sieges can look amazing and army units are decent enough, there are equal as unpolished or plain bad textures as well. The leaders & heroes are the main offenders here: hair, beards and sometimes armor clipping or looking translucent, clothes or armor clipping through mounts,... Customizing your own leader has been expanded upon graphically, which I can only commend but the sore lack of extensive options makes this but a tiny timewaster rather than anything worthwhile. I confess, this is far more important in an RPG than it is in a TBS, but it looks half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥nonetheless (example: No skin-tone for Dark Elves whilst the High Elves race is a mixture of both Wood Elves & Dark Elves). Furthermore, while some ingame items equipped to these heroes show up on their avatar and thus offers a nice nod to detail, other items do nothing of the sort. In my opinion, either do all or none of the items lest you create the notion you hadn't the time to bother with them all.Some flying units have issues as well when fighting over lava or water. If the unit in question has an idle stance where it lands itself until ordered, it gets submerged nearly completely in said lava or water. Creating another idle animation when fighting over water or lava could have provided a solution here, as of now it just gnaws at the player's experience.- ContentAge of Wonders 1 had 12 playable races, Age of Wonders 2 had 15 playable races (12 in the original, 3 extra in the expansion), Age of Wonders 3 has 6 of these races. Not only a major plunge in what you can play, but all units feel much the same with different skins. Although each races varies slightly from the standard template (Dwarves have 1 extra defense & resistance but cost 10% more gold to recruit, Orcs suffers -1 ranged damage yet gain +1 melee damage, etc...), none feel as diverse as they were in previous games. While some units do have unique abilities (Elf Unicorn Riders pack the Phase-ability, unique to them), their stats are nearly equal apart from their racial modifier! To me, the varied stats seemed to have a far greater impact in previous installments, contributing to each race's unique style. The only units I currently feel that make a unique impact over its peers are the Orc Greatsword and the Elf Gryphon Rider due to enhanced stats or extra abilities.Next comes the story, spoiler tag inserted:Even though they try to take the story into a new direction, this game only contains 6 or 7 missions per campaign to explain it. Aside from being utterly uninspired with an ending that just oozes: BUY OUR EXPANSION SINCE THIS RESOLVES NOTHING; all of these missions fall into the same tedious category of: ""Build a base from scratch against overwhelming enemy numbers who rarely do anything and sit there until you grind them piece by piece into a pulp."" The last and fifth mission of the Elven campaign are notorious for this in my book. Aside from a few skirmishes into your terrain, they'll just wait until you come to besiege them. A few secrets here and there spruce up the lot, but they are far too minor to sit through hours & hours of same old empire building & grinding the foe to a pulp. Since nearly every mission is played with a different leader as well, don't count on transfering your researched spells over into the next scenario like you did in Age of Wonders 2! In my opinion, endless padding. The only plus was that it forced you to play with many of the classes the game has to offer, daring players to test all it has to offer, albeit not that much. - MultiplayerAs many posts on the Age of Wonder III tech support website indicates, a tremendous amount of players is having issues even making a connection to other players. I had this same issue until I disabled my McAfee software, the ONLY game I must do this for in order to play it online even when adding said game to the exceptions list. Even though the game forwards ports automaticly in the hopes to get a connection going for the owner, I still feel this is a nuissance that could have been avoided or handled in a better way than just stating ""Your router must cause the issue, call your providers to sort it out!"".When you're finally able to get this mode to work, the only feasible tactic to win the game under an hour is to rush your opponent to oblivion. I've played multiple team sessions and Free-For-Alls, all ended in either two scenario's. A: as stated before, players rushed eachother with their starting stack and hoped to have randomly received a summoning spell at the start of the game in order to crush their foe, quiting if they lost too many units along the way. B: People played passively for an hour and then quit the game due to a lack of intrest. In short: Play with friends so you can extend the game past the hour mark or fight it out until the bitter end. There is nothing satisfying about games ending abruptly because one felt it didn't go his or her way.VERDICT:I wanted this game to be good, I truly wished for this as I am a long-time fan of the series. I adored the previous games but with all the issues & disappointments I've encountered here, I cannot urge others to buy, let alone play it. A few more months to expand the content provided would have made this game a worthy addition but for me in its current state: It falls short.I've probably missed a few things here & there, but I hope my review helped you decide if this game is worth your time & money.

												The game is one of those i love and hate. I love the rpg elements of creating a leader, hiring heros, and finding loot. I love the combat system. I love so much about this game! However, I hate that the only acceptable tactic in this game is super aggressive expansion into every buildable tile possible. The fact that their is only a single strategy that can be used to stand a chance is really dissapointing. I mostly turn city building off because of this, and that helps. I mean it is a good game in some ways, and a horrible one in others. The biggest being the lack of depth in the strategy. I can't really recomend this game, but it isn't the worst thing I played. Just needs a new system to limit the rewards for city spamming.			"

												Solid Turn based strategy game for fans of Heroes of Might and magic and or the lod Age of Wonders Game.Pros:A large variety of heroes and faction combinations accomodate multiple playstyles. Something I always loved about the Age of Wonders game is the magic system. Spells are very strong in this series and  allow for many tactical sheananigans. In this game you can choose how strongly you want to focus on magic or if you'd rather prefer conventional armies.The performance is solid. Little lag and framedrops, though I expierence occasional crashes on my older PC.Cons:The AI, as is often the case in strategy games, is not impressive, especially when it comes to diplomacy.I feel like the balance between factions and heroes could use improvement.All in all, a worthy addition to the Age of Wonders sereis. If you loved shadow magic, then you'll love this too.			"

												Game is great with the expansions, and it actually managed to capture that MoO2 feel for about a week but is marred by a few issues. The AI is bad.  Not terrible, but bad.  Combat is a little simplistic all things considered and feels pretty grindy late game.The simultaneous turn thing was a little weird at first, but it makes much more sense than the alternatives even if creates the illusion of lag.  It also prevents players from being at a disadvantage in a turn due to combat.The game really shines in multiplayer but the AI issue will really leave single players and pure co-op players frustrated eventually, but likely not until they've gotten their moneys worth anyways.

												Age of Wonders 3 is a 4X turn based strategy game, with a fantasy setting. I haven't played the previous games in the series, and I'm not the most knowledgeable gamer when it comes to this genre as a whole. I've played a couple of games each in the Civilization and Total War franchises but not much else. In my non-expert view, AoW3 is a pretty good game, and I've had some fun with it.Most concepts will be familiar to anyone who ever played a similar game. Expand your empire by creating cities, construct buildings to improve things like economy and production, research new technologies, train armies, move them around the world map and then take direct control on the battlefield.AoW3 has a strong emphasis on combat, in fact every victory condition (at least in the campaign mode) is related to conquering your enemies, Total War style. There's no equivalent of Civ's peaceful victory conditions, however if you can create a diplomatic alliance with another faction, you are allowed to win together.This isn't necessarily a complaint, because I like AoW3's battle system. The world map is divided into a hex grid, and each army stack can hold up to 6 units. When you attack, all the units in that hex and the 6 surrounding hexes, will be included in the battle. So the positioning of your armies becomes vital, and with a little tactical planning you can create a numerical advantage before the battle even begins.The battlefield is where the game really comes to life for me, because of the fantasy theme. I love RPGs, so I really enjoyed the use of magic spells and supernatural creatures. There's an amazing variety of units in this game. Of course you've got the standard melee, cavalry and archer units, which function pretty much the same whether they are Human, Elf or Dwarf. But then you can have dragons that fly over castle walls, giants that just bash those walls down, unicorns can teleport behind an enemy, succubus can seduce an enemy to fight for you ... and so much more.Your generals can cast spells to damage or stun the enemy, buff or heal your troops. They can equip loot, better weapons, armour and rings for passive buffs or resistance to elemental damage. They can gain XP and level up where once again, there are dozens of abilities to choose from.The enemy AI is easily the best I've seen in this genre. Playing on normal difficulty, I was frequently punished for my mistakes. If I leave a city undefended, the enemy will capture it. I actually learned the importance of flanking the enemy for bonus damage, by watching the AI constantly doing it to me.This is also the first strategy game that I've played that has a scripted story. Elves and Humans are at war, you can play as either side, and each chapter takes place on a different map. The story branches half way through based on a decision made by the player, and leads to one of three different endings. Dialogue is a mixture of voiced and text. And I must mention that the music is fantastic.It took me 52 hours to complete one side of the campaign. Some of that is because I screwed up the later missions so badly that I had to restart the map and try a different tactic, but still, its long enough to make a full price purchase easily worth it. During all that time I don't recall noticing any bugs (unless you count Goblin Beetle riders ;)).			"

												TL;DR: If you like a fantasy-themed, combat focused, round based X4 go get it. It's a very good game. The Golden Realms and Eternal Lords DLC are highly recommended as well.When I say this a combat focused X4 I mean it - this game is probably focused mostly on the eXpand and eXterminate aspects of the X4 genre. Don't expect any deep dipomacy or city building aspect, it mainly focuses on expanding your empire and overthrowing your enemy. While the addons add additional victory conditions, still the focus is mainly on combat, however it does this very well with an insane amount of depth.Battles are extremly strategic. Positioning and composition of your units matter a lot. Units can be flanked for extra damage, many units retaliate (fight back in melee) if they are attacked, or they do attacks of oppurnity on enemies that run past them. Ranged attacks deal damage depending on range and line of sight. Many units have active abilities often also reflecting the choice in your class (like dreadnaught class, for example engineers class units can reload other class units like cannons or muskeets that could otherwise only fire every two tactical rounds, all units only available to that class).The whole element setup and unit-ability plays a huge role as well. If you defend your city with all archers (which deal physical damage) vs units that have high protection against physical damage, you'll have a hard time if you win at all. Casting spells here might save the day, since they could give your units elemental damage or lower the enemy resistance.Obviously you want to mix up your units so that you a good chance of winning over attackers. When attacking a walled city, you probably want some way to finish off the defeners on the wall, either with spells or possibly with flying units or with units that can climb the walls. Or you choose to simply destroy the walls and then move in. Instead you use units who don't get a penality when shooting up the walls and simply shoot the defenders down. .Cons:* AI, while probably the best I've faced in a RBS 4X so far, suffers from the same problem that it can get rather predictable after a while * End-game can be boring (usually turns into a steamroll/spam fest)* Diplomacy is very basic* Town management, while substantially improved with Golden Realms expansion, is rather basicPros:* runs very smooth (on my system)* visually fitting for the theme and overall very appealing* story and lore is integrated into the game and the classes/units feel very thematic* good music* game includes character customization for your heros* single player campaign while short is pretty good* random maps have a decent amount of settings to customize* AI is compared to other games very capable and can pose a threat (though of course, for a seasoned player you'll figure AI exploits eventually)* modding toolkit/support* classes play very differently and have their own flavour* races also play somewhat differently and come with their own flavour (and strengths/weaknesses)* specalizations allow you to further customize your playstyle* spell castingFantastic:* the class/race/specalization combinations make things highly varied (in particular to games like civ)* RPG deeply integrated - units can level up, the game contains hero which are fully levelable complete with skills and equipment (which can also be found in encounters on the map as well as crafted in cities)* tactical combat - this makes it possible to have very deep and tactical battles that can take a while. Unit placement, unit abilities, spell, everything matters			"

												I have recently nominated this game for the Steam 'Just one more turn' award. I have played all the Age of Wonders series. I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite games of all time. There's something about Triumph Studios; they just 'get it' when it comes to these type of games.  As I have stated elsewhere, this game is a remarkable piece of work of which the aforementioned developer should be very proud.Heart-touching.			"

												Pretty much all about the warmongering.Age of Wonders 3 is very much a niche title, even within the 4x game, however, it covers that one niche really well. It's a game about combat, and everything, from the UI, to the city building, to diplomacy itself is entirely in service to the engine of war that this game runs on. Cities are built to build and fund more soldiers. Spells and techs are researched to give an edge in battle or allow you to get more soldiers to bring into battle. Heroes are recruited and trained and killed in the name of war. And they will die, because death comes fast.The game's selection of Races offer little more than stat changes for your units, granting passives and and a few advantages/disadvantages here and there. Elves have better archers, but are weak to poisons. Goblins have poorer stats, but massive innate poison resist. It's not too important, but definately does shift how you play. As elves, you'll snipe from max range often. As draconians, you won't care much about non-lethal incoming damage.Classes, namely leader class, determines far more, from your tech tree to your unique units, taking much of what is traditionally race based in other, less warmongering 4x games. Rogues get access to demons, stealth spells, and plenty of tricks to force enemy cities into open revolt. Theocrats tithe for gold like it's going out of style. Dreadnoughts cover massive areas in fiery death with warmachines that outright immune poison and holy damage, but lack counter-attack ability.Combat is suprisingly quick, due to units being able to destroy eachother in short order. Even levelled heroes are able to be struck down by a few first tier archers focusing fire. As such, mistakes get punished hard.The game has great customization for the genre, letting you tailor your tech tree, your character and diplomacy screen appearance, hero growth, and make custom equipment to fit the situation.In summary: I wholeheartedly suggest picking this game up if you're like me and your games of GalCiv2 or Civ V regularly decend into ""If it moves, kill it."". Age of Wonders 3 simply does warmongering so much better, even if it comes at the cost of alternative victory conditions.			"

												This game is the♥♥♥♥♥♥right there. No need to say it, but it took the best of AoW 1 and AoW 2, mashed it together and improved the rest of the game. The soundtrack is also a nice nostalgia trip for me too.But a few things need some improvement.-Needs incentives for having an alignment, some design decisions are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You raze a city. You get evil points for it. You settle the ruins of the city. You gain good points for it. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing city that you pillaged to the ground, wiped out their inhabitants and settled the ruins again with your own people. It shouldn't be more 'beneficial' than outright settling the city with members of your own race. It's like rubbing salt on someone's festering wound. How the ♥♥♥♥ would you gain good points for it? Just rebuilding the ruins of the city after you looted and pillaged that city to the ground? -Late game is a whole cluster♥♥♥♥. Everything plays the same way. Above all else, it was fun and I'm just waiting for the inevitable Necromancer DLC. Been dying to try it out to get a feel of it.It's planned that the game would be a lot more moddable than it is. So I'm looking forward to that!			"

												    A fantastic sequel that improves upon an already classic game. Anyone who enjoyed the original Age of Wonders installments would be doing themselves a disservice by ignoring this game. Improved combat (balancing, animation, visuals), Improved heroes (fewer objectively correct leveling choices, more interesting abilities), Improved main character (you are actually encouraged to use him as an aggressive unit now), Improved low level units (basic ranged units are actually worth while now, flanking allows low level melee units to maintain some relevance later in the game) and fantastic overland map rich with detail and a fantastic cloth world map ala Elemental/Fallen Enchantress. The fact that Triumph chose to keep hotseat multiplayer in the game means that it will likely have a place on my hard-drive for years to come.    The only things that I feel could be added to the game are more races, classes, units and spells...but who doesn't want that in any game thats enjoyable. Well done Triumph, I look forward to see what advancements you have in store for this very solid foundation.			"

												When I saw this was coming out I was really nervous.  Because Disciples 3 exists, and ubisoft has made heroes unplayable with their terrible launcher ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.I bought it anyways, because AoW has always been fantastic.  Then I opened it for the first time and...oh god, a login screen.  Fortunately before commiting ritual suicide I noticed a play as guest option.  Okay fine.  There's a launcher, but you -DO NOT HAVE TO USE IT.-  Phew, one bullet dodged, sort of.Get in game, looks nice.  Music is good.  Music...sounds familiar.  Hmmmmmmmm.  Start a campaign.  I'm ecstatic to see they use the same style of opening sequences as the previous games, and they use them to do a quick recap of the previous lore.  This isn't a reboot or anything?  Sweet.  The voice acting is good so far, huge bonus.  So I start a campaign and pretty quickly you get into your first fight.  And then, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Battle Macabre starts playing.  It's not exactly the same, but it's damn close.And then 7 hours have passed and you have no idea what happened.The music is really great.The combat is fun, very much what you'd expect from AoW.No disciples 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Launcher service is optional.If you like TBS and/or any previous Age of Wonders then this is a must buy.			"

												When I was young I played the original Age of Wonders to death. As i got older I still played it and it became one of my most beloved games. Now while I do have a biased point of view I will tell you this : AOW3 Feels so much like the original is frightening. It seems like Triumph decided to start with the original and flesh out what was good and shave off the bad. I feel that they did a fantastic job making this game exactly what it should be. The overall gameplay makes you think that its a CIV knockoff but after playig it for some time I realized that its just similar, nothing more. I like the overall feel of the game and the only complaint I had was that the screen scrolling seemed quite clunky.I truly think they did a great job making the combat system emulate the original while giving it a unique feel that makes you want more. I'm excited that they kept commander (or leaders) in the game which nearly makes the game a turn based RPG. One of the best additions to this sequel is the ability to create a random map. While random maps are pretty standard now (or should be honestly) it brings a breath of longevity to the game.If you enjoy turn based stragety games that are fun and have dynamic combat this is the game for you. I truly think you'll spend hours enjoying this game and exploring or conquering your own world!			"

												Game is wonderful, significant improvements over the 2003 release. If you like the original Age of Wonders games and the Civ Series this is a great game for you. Highly Recommend			"

												Awesome game, very addictive, you could easily spend hours just doing one more turn. The campaigns have a couple maps each, and each map can easily take 5 or 10 hours to finish!Terrible for the wrist and your sleeping hours though.			"

												This entry is a fantastic --albeit different-- return to the series. If you want a turn-based high-fantasy strategy game, look no further than AoW.However, I can say without a flinch that if you wanted to truly enjoy Age of Wonders, you should start with the earlier games. As good as this game is, it's nowhere near earlier instalments. No, this is not nostalgia kicking in, I'm actually playing Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic right now, and it has more races, more units (some will tell you AoW 3 has more units, but they'll omit the fact that a decent portion of them are literal copy-pastes).The old games stick to a recognized lore, so you literally will not see Angel Goblins (I'm not kidding, they're called ""exalted"".. the struggle is real), Elvish trolls (""Warbreeds""), and other ridiculous units.Bottom of line, this game is great for what it is, an attempt to revive a highly praised franchise, and although it falls short in many ways, it is still a good game for all it's worth. Fans of AoW will definitely like this entry, while newcomers may shy away from the bizarre setup.Plus, the developers are really trying to appease everyone, and they're constantly supporting and updating the game. They can literally cash in and make a new game with all the updates and DLC they've done, but they chose to support this already existing game. Triumph is no big studio, so this says a lot.Thank you Triumph, this is a good game. Although, we're still hoping for an SM-tier entry. :-)			"

												Great Successor to Shadow Magic. The new classes diversity really adds something unique and varied that the other iterations or AOW lacked. Fanboy nonsense aside, I will say the game is in desperate need of optimization and a total rework of multiplayer connectivity.			"

												The sequel to one of the best fantasy turn-based strategies that ever hit the digital world. Still great, still addictive, still includes Dire Penguins (which are Dedicated to Evil). Makes me rather sad that the development is already coming to an end due to disappointing sale figures. Shame on you, people. Shame on you.			"

												So far I have played 10 hours of this game, and to tell you the truth the game is just gorgeous. I can't believe how much work was put into every single detail. The in game guide makes it so easy to learn what each unit does, and how to use spells correctly that it makes you want to sink in and spend hours and hours just learning. You are able to play whichever way you like. You can conquer, and jump into battles or you can slowly develope and form alliences without having to rush. It is one of those games that makes you appreciate gaming industry, and why we play games in general. As I said before I have only played about 10 hours of the main campaign and so far I have not one complaint. To whoever is reading this I strongly recommend to try this out because I have not been so hooked on a game ever since original WoW came out (now it isn't as great anymore). In my book this game is 10/10			"

												This game is CIV 5 but with magic and more movement. Also has little skirmishes whenever you fight something, unlike CIV (You zoom into a little battle, which is entirely identical to DnD but digital). Less focused on economy and city management, more focused on combat, which is perfect for me. If you liked Civ but wanted more combat, buy this. Graphics are lovely, slightly more optomised than CIV. There are ""Heros"" which act as leaders, have extra spells and get an inventory in which to store loot (you get loot from raiding tombs, dungeons and ruins. Such as a musket, a staff, armour or a necklace). Theres a leveling system for all units, so fight with them and they increase in potency, which makes a good deal of effect on combat. There are parts of the game that you breese through, and some that you just get wrecked. Unlike Civ, cities dont fight for themselves, you need to put normal units in them, and any sieges against them are fought by them, with a wall being the advantage given to the defenders. All in all, its a great game. £30 is a bit steep, so you might want to wait for a sale, anything over 10% off would seem like a decent deal to me.			"

												This is my second review, the first one I did not recommend the game. I decided to redo the review as I have spent quite a lot of time playing the game and have grown to really like it a lot. If you approach it without the comparisons with Civilization, then you wont be too disappointed at the lack of victory options, and the diplomacy is very weak. This leaves you with inevitable combat, however it is lots of fun and theres always the option of auto battles. Playing single player on a large world with maximum AI opponents it can be a very long game with lots of things going on. Graphics and sound are top notch, the length of time the AI sometimes takes for its turns can be rather long at times. Highly recommended, dont delay buy today.......			"

												Hahaha what an Impressive comeback! I almost dropped a tear the first time I heard the old tunes played in game, I love the idea of bringing the old story and tunes of AOW I back to life. I was really excited when I was aware that the heroes can still be moved independently, I almost thought the game was a Heroes Might and Magic back then hahaha I think this is a must get for AOW veteran players, I purchased this game in hard financial times but I'm kinda happy I did that, Keep up the great work, Triumph Studios, I love AOW series forever and ever!

Posted: March 23, 2015
												I have mixed feelings on this game.   Ill start by saying that I own all the previous AOW games and have played them through many times and also multiplayer.1. A number of downgraded changes were made from aow 1-2 in the area of gameplay, seemingly in favor of better graphics.2. The sound tracks from the older versions were better, IMO.   Plus the lack of a customizable playlist that existed in all other AOW games bothered me.   I had asked a dev if they could implement the customized playlist like the older games have and they did say they would see if it could be done...3. The change from 8 units to 6 units per army...  I cant say I liked that.   It made the combat less diverse tactical. They ought to have increased to 10.  But this was probably done because of the more intense graphics and in battle animations/particle effects wouldnt allow for good framerates.  More units in a battle would probably make it unplayable except for the best PC's.3. Flying or floating units are no different than any other now.  Basically a unit with wings doesnt actually fly anymore.  I understand why they changed it, but they didnt have to.4. There is a very steep power curve between the different teirs in aow3.  Too steep.  Any lesser units are basically useless later.  In AOW1-2 even a tier 1 unit still had a chance to survive vs a tier 4.  Now? no way.  The power gap is too much, and you only get 6 units per army.  If you could have more it would be economical to bring more cheap units to a battle and only a few expensive ones.  5. The heroes in aow3 are somewhat weaker.  Your armor and resists have a negligible effect.  And your heroes are heavily targeted.  They are most just for show and spellcasting but cant really fight very well.  In aow1-2, your heroes really were heroes.  In this game they are wall flowers...6.  Every time your units get attacked they turn to face the attacker, after the fact. This facing change that happens every time a unit is hit is really dumb.  Your units can be attacked from the rear several times because of it, and it really makes your heroes feel useless when it happens to them and enemies always seem to focus on your heroes too.7. Castle and tower walls are just graphics now.  They are pretty useless for slowing down the attackers and several times I felt that playing defence behind a wall was actually detrimental and did little to stop attacking forces.  In this regard I feel like a good defensive strategy is a moot point.  In aow 1 and 2, seiging a walled city or tower was pretty difficult, as it should be.  You had to build and bring siege weapons in order to get past walls.  There were not many unit types that could climb or fly over walls.  And you needed ranged attacks or your own flying units(or magic/spider webs/druid entangle and other - such diversity that was stripped from aow3...) to deal with flying units. AoW3 just has too may ways for units to circumvent or destroy the walls too quickly and easily. Its like the walls and gates arent even there.  Also in aow1-2 cities had a number of magicaI defenses you could unlock and build.  It really made sieging a city quite an ordeal.  I resorted to using the auto battle instead of torturing myself....8. Magic domains in aow 3 are also another moot point now.  Your leader should not be able to use any magic outside it like it was in aow 1-2.  I feel like this magic domain mechanic is anti AOW, which has always been about wizards and their towers and domains and their armies being powerless outside of them unless the leader or hero was physically present.If you never played an AOW game before, these flaws probably wont be noticable and you might like it.But if your like me, the differences and dumbed down mechanics from aow1-2 will make you not enjoy this game as much as the originals and possibly even regret buyng it.  Ive tried playing through the campaigns twice now, and the story is interesting, but the dumbed down gameplay turns me off and I get tired of it.			"

Short description: for the TL.DR people.   Age of Wonders III is a sequel to the series, having not played the previous I can’t compare it to them. Though the game has a bit of Civilization, Heroes: Might and Magic and some RPG like elements.    What I mean by those is that the game lets you create the empire/leader you wish to have those include:ClassSpeciesGenderTraits   These materials help creates your empire and leader on how you wish to conquer each Age of Wonders III world maps that can also be customizable from how many treasures and mobs to how much of kind of terrain. Even if the World Map is mostly a Vulcanic place but you want to whole world to be Frozen you can do that if your traits correspond to being able to make the lands arctic.    If the world is corrupted you can cleanse it which will put you on the Good Alignment making it easier to be friends with people of the same Alignment, but that also means those that are on the Evil Alignment are going to be your enemies of course.Game Story:   At the start of the game you can either go into Singleplayer Story or Singleplayer Skirmish, the latter means you make up a story as the game proceeds with the Empire and Character you’ve created or chose from a preset before starting the Skirmish.    Now the 1st kind has you choosing from 2Vanilla(“The Elven Court” & “The Commonwealth”) stories and 2DLC(“Eternal Lords” & “Golden Realms”) based stories each unique in its own way and each having a story to tell and show you a world of wonders (pun intended)Scale:GreatGoodDecentNot badBadNopeGame: GoodGraphic: GoodSound: GoodAnimation: GoodAI: DecentGameplay: GoodModding: DecentClarifying the scale:- Graphics    Graphically speaking the game is good to be honest, visually aesthetic and pleasing to look at for longer periods of time well I suppose that depends what kind of Empire you chose to be being an Arctic Empire and staring at the white abyss can be rather too much for people that don’t like that look. Then again you wouldn’t be playing with that if you didn’t like it, each kind of Empire has their own unique look depending on how they chose their traits to be. A Druid will have a very green area filled with forests where as a Necromancer will have a very barren and desolate maybe even corrupted land.    The micro-manage battles look very good when using spells or sending soldiers to fight, those same or other magics that are Empire-wide or World-wide will also have a visible effect in some cases that looks nice. - Sound    The sound is only good because I’ve had a few times where my sound was bugging out and that can be annoying, but other than that the sound is great and as a good fidelity when you take an Archer Unit and order it to shoot at a Machine Unit (usually made of metal/wood) you can hear the arrows hitting that metal/wood. What I mean is that it’s not the same sound for every landing attack.- AI    The AI of the game acts corresponding to their traits and alignment and so far, I have had no issues with the AI doing something out of the ordinary like they would in a Civilization game. Now it is only on Decent because there are some aspects of the AI that could’ve been done better, like if a Good Alignment AI is good that I would expect them to cleanse the land a bit more or an Evil Alignment AI would corrupt.    It could of course also be that I haven’t played enough to be able to see that develop and since I’ve always been either an Arctic or Temperate Empire I would’ve reshaped the land per my own traits.- Gameplay     Gameplay wise the game is easy to understand and get into, although I am still having an issue with combat mechanics, but that’s mostly due to my part of not doing much combat in the game. Other than that, the gameplay is well done, research is required to do anything in the game but if you focus like a maniac on knowledge like I’ve always done you learn everything so fast that by the time I am in mid game I have all the spells, buildings etc. that are within my traits.    An awesome mechanic I’ve liked in the game that besides being able to craft your own gear for your heroes/leader you can also do World Quests well they are called Empire but since all Empires participate I find it more appropriate to call them that World Quests.    Each one of those has a goal and a reward the first Empire to complete that goal will receive a reward it can be anything from a Unit to an Empire-wide buff.There are so many more things I could be saying in this clarification of the Gameplay, but I will leave that for discovery, I am just giving a “small preview”.- Modding The area is Decent because I’ve looked at some of the mods in the workshop and they look good, but I’ve never personally tried mods in this game since I’ve still yet to finish all the achievements and stories of the game so before that I will stay away from mods.Conclusion: for the TL.DR people   This game to me at least is a gem in the rough and worth picking up it’s not often I find a game that I like the style of just by looking at it, this one was one of them and I had it on my Wishlist for a while before I decide to say best way to find out if I like it is to try it and I did and I liked it.   If you like(d) Heroes: Might and Magic series, Civilization series and/or you want some RPG elements in your RTS/TBS games like say being able to decide what kind of leader to have or what kind traits you want you Empire to have and can specify then this is something you should at least consider it. Speaking from my own point of view, it was not time wasted it was everything I liked put into one game.			"

												It's barely even beleivable how good this is, just a masterclass in every category. Get this if you don't have Civ V, or even if you do. It can easily co-exist in the same space, it offers a fairly unique experience without sacrificing quality. It's a bit less plodding and quite a lot more awe inspiring. Do you like the idea of teaming up Frost Giants with Mechanized Spider Tanks to take on Giant Beetle Riders and Succubi? This is your jam!			"

It can be a chore once in ""clean-up mode""CONCLUSION:An overall wonderful gaming experience that so far, hasn't lost it's charm. If you like fantasy and 4x games, then you'll likely enjoy countless hours of ignoring the real world in favor of this one.Cheers!			"

												This game is brilliant.  If you're looking for a fantasy 4x with a military/tactics focus, this game takes the cake.  Economy management is extremely simple compared to Civ5 or other 4x games so if that's your interest I'd look elsewhere.  However the unit diversity, spells, and tactical battles of this game are unmatched.  The assymetrical balance via combinations of starting race and leader class really makes for truly epic dynamic compared to the copy pasted civilizations featured in other games.  Playing a Dreadnaught (engineer) leader is a whole different ball game from playing a Druid or a Theurgist.  Seeing a battlefield of up to 42 units strewn with one army of cannons, tanks, and musket men standing on a city wall vs an army of shaman and summoned beasts set to a wonderful backdrop of a massive rising city scape really brings the game to life.Worth every penny.

												Bought this game years ago expecting a fantasy civ, something that I'm still struggling to find today. It's really not though.Instead, it's a very fast paced, turn-based strategy with an emphasis on exploration and combat rather than economy and diplomacy.Think of it more of a fantasy, turn-based total war and, if you like the thought, you will be very satisfied playing this game.

												Love this game.  Reminds me a lot of the old Warlords series.   Get a hero, build units, create a stack and then go conquer.  But there is more complexity then just that.  If you like 4x, turn based strategy games like the Endless series, then you will probably like this game.   The only con (if you can call it that) is the slow paceing.  Games progress very slowly.  Large maps can take forever.  However it is fun, so I forgive it for being a major time suck.			"

												The best turn-based 4X fantasy game available. The best way to judge a good 4X game is if it compels you to take one more turn many hours longer than you planned to.... For me this game does that better than any other turn-based 4X fantasy game. If you like 4X turn-based fantasy games, buy it now and starting losing sleep!   10/10The best 4X fantasy list:Age of Wonders 3Heroes of Might and Magic 5 & 6Endless Legends "

												Can't recommend this game but it may be, at least in part, due to how I play this type of game. When I play a 4X game, campaign mode in particular, I want to be able to enjoy the setting. I want to build my cities, armies, and empire. This game is just a xenophobic sprint to tier 4 units. If you sit back at all the AI will crush you. On normal, the AI has numerous bonuses to everything and starts to send steamroll armies at you while you are still trying to enjoy setting up your empire. If you want to progress then you have to rush as fast as possible, save often, and dump all hero points into defense.Scenario is more of the same from an AI perspective. Diplomacy is pointless and random. The AI leaders remind me of Ralph Wiggum: ""I'm HAPPY AND ANGRY"".In short, not a terrible game but there are better 4X games out there to spend my money and time on.			"

												One of the best strategy games ever! Unlike Civ 5, Age of Wonders has tactical combat (rather than running two units into eachother), vastly differing classes supported by moderately different races, and NO PUNISHMENT FOR EXPANSION!!! Additionally, Age of Wonders is much faster paced and more centered on elite forces (heroes, champion units, etc.) than Civilizations, leading to a greater investment in specific armies and their powerful commanders. Expand, build armies, and WRECK your friends!			"

												Ok so, off the bat. I have not played the first two games to be able to compare it to them.Other TBS I have played are Heroes,Fallen Enchantress and something else that I can't quite remember the name of.ANYWAY. I brought this on a whim after getting tired of Fallen Enchantress and needing a game to keep me occupied before the next borderlands came out. (At time of writing). The idea behind i'd pick up something that wouldnt keep me too hooked and I could just put down...just put down...This game is addicting, the first TBS in a LONG time to give me the ""just one more turn"" feeling. I will not be putting this game down anytime soon. I'm not one for long winded reviews so i'm going to do a good old Positive & negative list.Positive:- A TBS game with an actual interesting story! (achivement in itself)-Fun to play-Beautiful art style and game, each race and unit looks fantastic.-Create-a-hero-Combat that makes you think (well me anyway..)-Brilliant system to learn mechanics, can simply type in a term to the in game Book that helps you and get brilliant explanation.Negative:- Well err....- Hmm...- Kinda wish you could zoom in a bit further.. but this is nitpicking as it's fine as it is..- Other TBS games I was looking at look really dull since I played this?  Is this even a thing? Probably bad for others but hmm..TLDR: Buy now, must have.			"

												Domination is the name of the game, and luckily this game does that very well. If you are looking for complex building or research options, vast diplomacy networks and interactions.. then this is not the game for you. But if you are looking for fantastic, highly tactical turn-based combat in a good fantasy setting then Age of Wonders 3 is going to satisfy your needs. The strategic map has great detail and a real sense of atmosphere (the music certainly helps out a lot in this endeavor), and there are plenty of combat maps that have a beautiful layout. Unfortunately, siege maps lack variation (you will be fighting on these the most) but beyond that this game does conquest incredibly well. Classes feel distinct and allow you to focus on your own playstyle, maps offer a lot of freedom and with two decent campaigns, scenarios and a good random map generator there is plenty for you to try out.

												Very enjoyable 4x strategy game. The single player is fantastic. The customization to your leader is enjoyable and fairly in-depth, as much as something like Fallen Enchantress. The combat is more enjoyable than most other 4x games. The multiplayer is a bit laggy and simeltanious turns + timers makes taking your turn really hectic but with patient players and classic turn style the multiplayer is fantastic, if not slow paced.

												If you're a strategy game fan and don't own this - FOR SHAME!  This is a seriously underappreciated gem. AOW III features a splendid balance between turn-based strategy and turn-based tactical combat, which is where this game truly shines. Featuring a robust roster of leader choices, which in turn allow a wide range of unit and spell choices for each playthrough, AoW III offers massive replayability options - and that's' BEFORE you tackle the Steamworks mod scene. What are you waiting for - get this game NOW!			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is not a game like Civilizations. They share things in common but the troop lineup is ripped straight from typical RTS games. AoW3 is a turn-based RTS complete with base building, buying stables to produce cavalry, buffing the units with upgrades and tech research (which takes time to build just as it does in an RTS) and spamming your favorite units across the map as early as possible.You'll explore tons of treasure sites, find optimal places to build a new base, and wrack up tons of experience and artifacts for your heroes. In that sense it's a competitive PVE game since optional autobattles and economy management can make the game about who has the stronger army as opposed to the smarter tactics. Units move extremely fast across the map unlike Civ and you can have your enemy's army invisible and at your doorstep without warning. Hope you left some defenders or you just lost your capital.Base rushing, expansion, tech research, build order, unit synergy, all important RTS elements and brought here for your amusement. Spy on the enemy with scouts to find out what he's building then build the perfect counter units that are essentially invincible against that type of enemy. Best part is that if you play for a VERY long time you will eventually get access to every race in the game by conquering neutral cities. So you can design your ideal endgame army and semi-reliably get it every game as long as you explored enough to find the right cities.If you played Heroes of Might and Magic then you know the drill.  Awesome game!			"

												I've spent several days and many hours, trying to give this game a try.Despite all complaints on Tier4 spam, I tried really hard to just enjoy the gameplay. But... What to say... a game with great potential but DEVASTATED by itself, or should I rather say by developers. Simply unplayable, unless the game creators do something to bring at least some ballance there.Going for a battle: 3 armies versu 3 armies, and seeing 15 Manticore Riders all together on the other side (or even more!!!) is just NOT FUN. And just after another 10-15 minutes, another 6-pack of Manticores arriving, and so on, and on... All other units except Tier4, become simply obsolete and useless after just 1-2 hours of playing...Would love to enjoy AoW:3, but simply cannot. Will not play it anymore, unless something is going to be done with Tier4....Please, make the Tier4 a centerpiece of army - one (1) per stack allowance would have been just perfect. For the moment Tier4 units are just pests, spoiling this beautiful game...			"

												Pretty alright for what it sets out to do. It's like Heroes of Might & Magic meets Civilization meets a big bag of crack cocaine. Great visuals and aesthetics. Combat is fun; a lot of depth lies in unit choice to compose units but actual combat feels insultingly shallow with most abilities being 'damage enemy' or 'heal ally'. Empire building is quite fun, the exploration aspect is wonderful, the hero level-up is fairly detailed. The create-a-character could use more options but it's par. The sounds, music, etc is good. Balance can be fairly topsy-turvy with most strategies being 'spam the ♥♥♥♥ out of your biggest units and butt♥♥♥♥ the enemy'. AI and Diplomacy need serious work -- very, very serious work. When your diplomacy system is actually worse than Civ 5 BNW's, you have an issue. All in all 8/10; you'll get anywhere from 10 to 40 hours out of it.			"

												One of the most amazing games I've played of late, whether playing classic (one player takes his/her turn and passes it on to the next player) or simultaneous turns, the different feel it gives to the strategy genre works particularly well from my standpoint. With classic, it will allow me and others I play with the ability to play what feels like a virtual game of chess. This while being able to enjoy the luxury of a lore filled world and roleplay a large number of different wizards, strategists or great leaders from a graceful 'tree hugging' elf to a dirty scheming goblin. An ideal game for the fantasy enthusiast for sure.			"

												In Short:PROS: -great gameplay -high replayability -very good multiplayer -easy to get into, hard to master -low price -frequent updates (it looks this way so far)-good balance-a lot of customization-nice graphics-beautiful musicCons:-relatively long games (not for the genre)-not that many people playing multiplayer-rather bad tutorial-not the most challenging AI (for veterans of the genre)This game is a steal! I bought my steam digital download version for 75PLN (about $25) and if you look online you can by it this cheap pretty much anywhere in the world. For this price you get a brand new game with 2 campaigns, each with 6 missions + 1 for alternative choices made. I would say this is easily 40 hours of gameplay, at least. Then you also have scenarios and endless possibilities with random map generator.The game is complex, but easier to get into than the likes of Europa Universalis, Total War, or even Civilization series. At the same time it offers plenty to more seasoned TBS and 4X players. It's different than almost anything else on the market. People compare this game to HoM&M, Civ, and Total War, but while it includes elements of all these games, it's still something totally different.If you enjoy 4X games, you should definitely try it. If you like TBSs in general you might want to give it a go. If all HoM&M titles after HoM&M 3 (and maybe 4) disappointed you, buy this game!For anyone who likes Civ, Gal Civ, HoM&M series this should be a definitve buy. People who like Paradox games should also consider it.The random map generator in this game is like nothing I have ever seen before. The number of options is mind blowing. You can customize the number of cities, their size, number of treasures, resource, visit structures, starting army sizes, and much more.There's plenty of strategy involved and enough variety to keep you playing for many hours. 6 classes, 6 races, and 14 specializations to choose from means you get to try out new things almost every game.And finally, the multiplayer. I don't know how 4X games could have existed without simultaneous turns. I used to play some with classic turns and it was a thrill, but it also dragged on way too long and I would never play with strangers for this very reason. Here you can start a small map 1 vs 1 game with smallest starting cities and medium armies and finish it in about half an hour, it that's your cup of tee. You can still play epic large map games with mutiple opponents and save your sessions, in this case too, the simultaneous turns option will vastly speed up the game. I was worried about using this over the classic turns, but it works like a charm, I use it even against the AI, there's hardly any reason not to.Buy this game! Even if you have never played 4X games before. This is a good game for beginners too and at this price it is worth giving it a go. The support for the game is amazing, the forums are very helpful and best of all there is more content to come in the form of dlcs and expansions, which are likely to feature new playable races, new scenarios, and maybe new campaigns			"

Posted: April 3, 2014
												An excellent tactical wargame. It plays like a combination of Might & Magic and Civilization, however it differs significantly from the both of them.First off: do not be fooled, Civilization fans. If you're looking for a fantasy equivalent of Civilization, this isn't going to perfectly scratch that itch. While it does have highly customizable kingdoms (with races and themes to pick from - steampunk elves and druidic dwarves are both possible, for example), the kingdoms themselves serve no purpose except to produce combat units. There is no need to improve tiles, and while civilization happiness is a factor, it's generally not an issue unless enemy empires start using magic to lower happiness within your cities. The biggest thing that hampers it from being 'fantasy Civ' however, is that there is no tech tree and there are no victory conditions other than to defeat your enemies, or attempt to form an Alliance between them.That said, if you were the sort of Civilization player who preferred scrapping with barbarian tribes and winning the game through domination of your enemies, this game may actually end up being a better alternative. It plays similarly to Civilization V, but it is entirely a wargame. It provides roaming bands of monsters to fight, and small dungeons to explore with your army and recover magical items to equip your heroes with. The independant cities (this game's version of City-States from Civ V) provide quests which can give magical item rewards, and can even reward you with joining your empire, giving you access to unique units such as fey and giants.The game turns into a Might & Magic-esque tactical RPG when in combat, providing a large grid with terrain to utilize for cover and flanking. Might & Magic players should be happy with what is provided here, though they should keep in mind that battlefields are typically much larger than the chessboard-esque M&M battlefields. Army sizes are also typically much smaller, with most engagements having no more than six units on either side. Only city battles can exceed this limit.I highly recommend this game to M&M fans, fans of tactical RPGs, and fans of Civilization who enjoy the Domination victory condition. However, Civ players who enjoy nonviolent victory conditions should look elsewhere.			"

The tactical battles are astounding - I used to always use quick battle in the old games, but I always do tactical in AoWIII. The world looks beautiful. I love the introduction of RPG elements, meaning that you can design your leader, pick a race, a class, and your alignment changes depending on your actions in the game.I could write everything here, but it'd go on forever. Just know that this is a great game.If you've played and enjoyed any of the previous AoW, do yourself a favor and grab this.			"

												I bought this game expecting the wrong things.  I wanted a 4x that focused on empire building set in a fantasy world, but this is much more focused on combat.  It is entirely my fault for not looking further into the title, but this is still a fair warning to those looking into purchasing this game.What is does offer is very good, though.  Everything else is well thought out.  Exploring is interesting because of the random dungeons and camps spread throughout, the AI is serviceable, and the simple hex-based tactical combat is actually pretty fun.  It just wasn't my cup of tea in the end, as I wasn't a big fan of HOMM games, but I can respect it for what it is and would recommend to people who are into this type of 4x gameplay.			"

												I played the first AoW religiously when it came out all those years ago. I never had the hardware to run the second one when it came out, but I was excited to find that a third iteration was in the works. Although I feel the depth of the game has been lost a bit, there are fewer units, and picking a race doesn’t really feel special anymore as many share the same unit pool (just with the obvious racial twist and visuals) I feel the game is still well worth the money paid. It is a polished game without bugs, the visuals are stunning, and the developers seem to show an interest in adding content through patches as the time goes on.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of this genre. There are many hours of enjoyment to be had with this title.			"

Age of wonders 3 is a 4x game crossed with an rpg. the lead your armys with your hero equiping new gear and leveling up, through dungeons or simply all out war. you can of course take the peaceful approach and build up your empire.WAR IS THE BEST OPTION (in the base game).The dlcs add more options for peace, aswell as new ways to build your economy and eventually be come a deity for a race. or become their worst night mare! Before each game you must choose : race, class, and speciallisations.RACE-like any rpg each races has areas they like to live in and different perks.CLASS-decides your perks, late-game units, spells, and upgrades each class counters another class.SPECIALLISATIONS-you can choose 3, they add different spells and sometimes units-each one has a different affects on playstyles. some encourage being good others evil but most neutral.in terms of empire bulding it IS a bit simple,but dlc DO improve with more options for building your cities. you get more buildings based off of what in in your territory.All in all tho its a great game! sure war will be likely be inevatible, but you can win by becoming a deity of several races and building a beacan of peace. there are options for lots of different playstyles!. Play it now! choose your lord! find your own path! may it be peace or a bloody war-path cutting down cities like they were grass.			"

												Undeniably one of the best Turn Based Strategy games and a true sequel to its estabilished franchise while at the same displaying a lot of maturity with its newly introduced mechanics.Age of Wonders 3 takes the best of all its predecessors and builds upon them instead of shoving new gimmicks in hopes of keeping things interesting. Its' reverence towards estabilished concepts is notable, instantly bringing out front what best characterizes the series: Epic battles between powerful personas in a high fantasy world. Those familiar with the series will delight in seeing the familiar towers in elvish cities and the armies of halfling pony riders charging across the fields.Its combat phase is greatly improved by increasing the units' presence in the battlefield with the added Guard stance and flanking abilities, giving the player much control on how his units will play their part on the battles. Even with the humongous number of abilities that each unit has all of them are finely interwoven with the estabilished systems of attack, defense and morale. The reduction of uncertainess that previous games had also opened venues to dozens of other tactics and created a wonderful balance between all units. No one strategy is unbeatable.What shortcomings this game had after launch have been fixed with balance updates and the expansions, all due to carefully listening and considering the feedback given by the community. Triumph Studios sets the example by truly creating and caring for its masterpiece in the fashion all other studios can only hope to be inspired by. They deserve all the recognition they can get.			"

												I haven't played Endless legend, but both of these games seemed similar and I had the choice between them. After some research: the basic difference is probably that Endless Legend is closer to Civilization/ Warlock, and Age of wonders is closer to Heroes of Might and magic.Age of wonders is a well done 4X game with combat reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic, but more strategic depth and world-strategy elements such as city building.Overall a great game, although the campaign story feels a bit 'meh'... it is basically a set of missions with each class so you can get used to it's strengths and weaknesses.  Multiplayer contains a lot of cheese or strong strats, but if you know what's possible it becomes a fun challenge to play around your opponent.Learning the game properly takes a while, there are a lof of mechanics that only make sense when you research them.

												Undeniably one of the best Turn Based Strategy games and a true sequel to its estabilished franchise while at the same displaying a lot of maturity with its newly introduced mechanics.Age of Wonders 3 takes the best of all its predecessors and builds upon them instead of shoving new gimmicks in hopes of keeping things interesting. Its' reverence towards estabilished concepts is notable, instantly bringing out front what best characterizes the series: Epic battles between powerful personas in a high fantasy world. Those familiar with the series will delight in seeing the familiar towers in elvish cities and the armies of halfling pony riders charging across the fields.Its combat phase is greatly improved by increasing the units' presence in the battlefield with the added Guard stance and flanking abilities, giving the player much control on how his units will play their part on the battles. Even with the humongous number of abilities that each unit has all of them are finely interwoven with the estabilished systems of attack, defense and morale. The reduction of uncertainess that previous games had also opened venues to dozens of other tactics and created a wonderful balance between all units. No one strategy is unbeatable.What shortcomings this game had after launch have been fixed with balance updates and the expansions, all due to carefully listening and considering the feedback given by the community. Triumph Studios sets the example by truly creating and caring for its masterpiece in the fashion all other studios can only hope to be inspired by. They deserve all the recognition they can get.			"

												First thing, I highly recommend you try one of the previous games to see if you like AOW's take on 4x games before you take the plunge. I've enjoyed this game very much. The tactical battles could be better. I find myself skipping through them sometimes even if i'm not playing multiplayer but they are more exciting than I've seen in any other game of this genre (except maybe legendary heroes). The overworld strategic elements are diverse and engaging.			"

												This game is wonderful. It has some things which could be better like possibility to build mines, farms etc. But it is better than AoW 2 like AoW 2 was better than AoW 1.Advantages:- great imperia atmosphere,- but first you must build this empire,- sometimes from begining,- in random game, in some cases it can be not easy,- but it can be easy,- you have many options diplomaic option,- also to avoid use military power to conquer smaller cities,- but if you dont like, you don't have to use diplomacy,- you can build imerial infrastrucuture (roads and... bridges!),- which will make your empire much stronger for defending it,- but without it you can play welll too,- sometimes faster actions can be also better than build infrastructure,- playing as evils is always more dificult than playing as good emperor like it should be in real,etc.Disadvantages:- short cmaign (but good),- a few options to build on stratgic map (roads, bridges (!), forst, watchtowers, cities),- there are modding software but without tutorials, I would like to make builder possible to build mines and farms! ;-)- bridges should be longer than one hex and should join to ""one"" if you build more than one in line.My subjective rate: 10/10(I very, very like game)P.S. If You want to build bridge, your buildier must have not to little moving points. River must be not wider than 1 hex in directionwhich you want to build bridge, also on next edge, it musn'y be mountains, other buildings and generaly I think nothing. And click ON the WATER not on the next edge. "

												Age of Wonders III is my favourite strategy game for a couple of simple reasons:1: it has the best tactical combat.2: it has great strategic play, where you need to decide what your priorities are and when to engage.3: the whole is greater than the parts. The strategic and tactical parts of the game complement each other greatly.This game is focused on strategy and combat. Everything relates to that, from empire building to leveling your heroes. But don't be afraid, it may be a lot of combat all the time, but the combat is deep enough to be different every time. The game's classes offer you many distinct flavours on how you run your empire, on what kind of army you build, on how your strategies play out. Some classes are more mobile, some classes are better at annoying others, some classes are better at simply building up. The difference does not lie in whether they have units to wage war with, the difference lies in how strong those units are, how they reinforce your armies, how your spells reinforce your armies and wether the class is better at direct battles or sneaking past the front lines.A bit about empire building: this game is not civilization. The way you develop your cities is not based on what research you unlock and there are NOT a hundred different buildings to choose from. Instead, your building decisions are based on what units you want to unlock, what resources you need more of and how many units you need right NOW. At first, empire building will seem simple compared to other 4x games, but it ties in very well with the other parts of the game.Dislaimer: I am a total fanboy. I've been part of closed beta testing and met the developers.Warning: This game has ruined tactical role playing games for me. It has ruined other strategy game tactical combat for me. I find those boring just because I'm used to AoWIII.			"

Tactics in battle are the games center and strong point.  MP is slow moving, but you can do so much stuff out of game, while your frien-emies are taking their turn.  You can pick it up on a sale for less than $10, a steal really.  If you get into it pick up Eternal Lords DLC.			"

												I played AOW2 frequently in my younger years. Though it has fewer races, there is a greater variety in leaders. So far I'm greatly enjoying the game. Between the Leaders and Races there are 36 combonations to choose from. Thats not even factoring in the spheres of magic.One warning. This game will murder your time. Not in an honorable way either. Most games murder your time face-to-face. Letting you know that it is slipping away. With this game, it waits until your time is asleep then smothers it with a pillow. You never see it coming. You look at the clock and it says 12:00, you look after what you feel is two hours and it still says 12:00. A closer look shows that it went from PM to AM. I bought a copy for my friend so he could experience time travel too.			"

												I am... Bitterly dissapointed in many aspects of the game, having come from a group that used to LAN this game quite often. Mostly this is because they have overhauled the wizard/player setup and the research tree into abominations (but there are other things, like how armies are 6 stack, instead of 8 from the previous). There are also a few persistant bugs that still need to be fixed (some units on huge maps sometimes don't renew their movement points after turns are set, and a few other somewhat minor things).I've put in some 130+ hours or so on it already, and I see myself putting more into it. The campaign isn't really all that in my opinion, but I never played this series primarily for the campaign. If you can get 3 or more friends (and half a day) to play with you on a small-medium map, this game is great. If you can get them to play multiple sessions, going on a larger map is better.That being said, I can't help but say that while it is only worth getting the game while it is on sale, it IS worth getting eventually. Especially if you can get friends in on it.			"

												Feels truly faithful to old Age of Wonders games, and is not a bug ridden mess like some other turn based games tend to be. The AI could surely be smarter, and it would be nice if towards the end of a long game, there was some actual use for lower tier units. But, that's about it for the negative things I can say of this game. The gameplay itself is otherwise brilliant and the game truly shines when played with your friends.			"

												This is not a Civilization V with magic around it, and before buying this game you should have this in mind. he city managing part id far too simple. You cannot modify the environment around it, all what is left is to choose which building or unit will be next, and if you will use a special resource. It is really a sad point, because everything is ready in the game to do this, so it is obviously a game design choice. Amateurs of city builder will not find this enough. Actually almost everything is focused around the combat. When enemy units meet, you can choose to resolve automatically or manually. If you choose manually, you then have a turn-based hexagon grid where you deploy your units, and where the deployment zones are functions of the relative locations o the units on the main map when the encounter started. This is not the big thing, but a nice idea. For the rest of the fight, it is dejà vu, so I will not go in details. But if you liked Heroes of Might & Magic, you get a lite version of the fighting encounter. In the long run it gets repetitive.You've got a campaign, which without being a paragon of originality is not bad at all.The graphics or the main map, are really nice, and the game runs without problems on Linux.It is hard to either recommend or not this game. I would have preferred a game more about management, but that said, it is not a bad game. If you like turn-based hex-grid battles in a fantasy world, you're a future customer.			"

												If you are a fan of the classic AoW games, this one may disappoint you a bit, especially if you are only interested in the Campaign mode and story. The storyline finishes before even you warm up. You can't bring your best levelled-up units to next level, which is why I bought this game in the first place. That was what made AoW awesome. You used try to keep units alive and level them up so you can take them to the next level. A huge disappointment for me.			"

												I'm going to start off this review with a couple of things:I've never played AoW 1 or 2And I'm going to compare it to HoMM3AoWIII is sorta a fantasy 4X game with very similiar gameplay to the heroes of might and magic series. You have a hero, town(s), and go around raising troops, casting spells, leveling up, exploring the map, and eventually conquering your enemy.The graphics are pretty nice, it's easy to tell what sort of terrain is what, units are stylistic, and overall the graphics suit the game well.  The music got boring real quick, normally with this kind of game you eventually turn off the music, but I had it off within a few days.A couple of big differences between this and HoMM are how units are handled. Gone are stacks of 5500 power liches, instead each 'stack' of units on the map can go up to 6 SEPERATE units. This means that a squad of swordsmen is treated as a single unit, and functions the same at 1 HP as it would full. I'm not sure if this good or bad, but that's just how it is.  While you might say battles would be smaller, they can actually be significantly bigger than HoMM, as you can have adjcent stacks on the map help you attack an enemy stack(s).Battles are also very different (yet) similiar compared to HoMM.  Like HoMM you can cast a spell a turn by your main hero, all your units move in a hex and have different ways to attack and special effects. However, in AoW it's more more tactical, there are flanking attacks that can potentially deny counter attacks and attacks of opportunity against the enemy if they try moving through an enemies' zone of control.  Another big difference between HoMM and AoW is towns. In HoMM towns are usually rare and extremely important objectives for either side, in AoW, you pretty much are able to build towns almost anywhere.  This is an interesting mechanic, but ultimately I found it very boring.  It isn't very difficult to  figure out where to place towns, and as the game goes on I felt I was wasting a lot of time picking what buildings to build in each of my cities, it isn't like civilization either where picking what to build can be a very strategic thing with upsides and downsides (upkeep).Compared to HoMM, the different races feel overall are way too similiar. Aside from minor stat differences and sometimes damage type differences each race will only have a couple of units that actually stand out from others.The point fo the above is to try and place an emphasis on hero types. At the start of the map you will select/customize a hero.  You'll choice from a choice of 6 different jobs and select 3 extra magic types.  The job has the biggest effect on how you will play the game. Each one gives you access to the majority of the spells/special units that you will recruit.  This is a very interesting mechanic, however I found it to be somewhat boring in practice.For example, playing as an archdruid will give you access to Hunters, they're basically bowmen that can charm animals, are better at crossing difficult terrain, and they wear very decorative large masks adorned with feathers.While playing as a draconian, they fit in perfectly with the rest of the army. However, this is how they look for ALL the races.Not only that but, they're almost identical no matter what race you have. Why can't goblin hunters focus on traps? Human hunters can be mounted or have tracking dogs with them?  It's even worse when you select a warlord, as two of their special units are bersekers and warkin (basically ogryn from 40k). All bersekers are bald. Even high elves. And they look absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If they couldn't differentiate the units in abilities due to balancing issues, at least they could make the units thematically look like they belong to the faction, something HoMM did very well.Another minor problem I have with the game is there isn't a quick access for your different heroes you might have hired, you have to bring up the overview panel then switch to your armies. This wouldn't be a problem, except for that you can't have the overview panel up at the same time as your city build orders, which is a problem, because over the course of the game you'll have both a large amount of cities and units.Additionally, the neutral units available for fighting and recruiting/prizes feel very small, it might just be because I played HoMMIII with WoG and that offered quite a good selection. Another thing HoMM had that AoW lacks are interesting items to loot for your hero or neutral unit hexes that let you hire them. While there are a couple of special town types like dragon they function a little differentlyI really want to like this game. Its combat is fun, and has some really great mechanics dragged down by citiy micomanagement, race diversity, and some lazy copy\pasting unit designsEdit: Since there's been two expansions for this game, they've been absolutely great. They did a pretty good job at giving each race more unique abilities, and added more neutral units and items. I don't like necromancers though, the mechanics they have seem so gamechanging compared to the other hero classes.			"

												I've been a fan of Age Wonders since the first time I played Age of Wonders: The Wizard throne in 5th grade. Since then, Age of Wonders have been the one game I have played continuously throughout middle school, high school, and college. In my opinion, Age of Wonders III is the best of the franchise.  One of the greatest strength of Age of Wonders is its combat. In my opinion, Age of Wonders III is the best of the series in this regard. AowIII introduces new mechanics like flanking which make unit position incredibly important. A smaller army can quickly gain advantage of a stronger army just by utilizing flanking to their best ability.  One of strengths of Aow is the wide variety of units. AoWIII continues this trend. Abilities include dominate, seduce, faerie fire, hurl fire bomb, web, assassinate, hurl boulder, phase (teleport), and much more. These abilities make combat a very engaging and enjoyable. AoWIII introduces a new class system. These classes include the dreadnought, archdruid, rogue, sorcerer, theocrat, and warlord. Each class as their own set of combat spells, empire upgrades, and units, giving all classes a unique playstyle. As of this review, Triumph is working on a necromancer class. More information on the classes can be found on at http://ageofwonders.com/category/news/. Like previous games, AoWIII has a variety of races that the player can choose from. The original AowIII has elves, goblins, orcs, humans, dwarves, draconians. Halflings were added in the Golden Realms Expansion. Each race gets an irregular, an archer, an infantry, a cavalry, a pikeman, priest unit, and special final unit. Upon first glance, the races appear to be quite similar. However, there are subtle differences that can end up really impacting one strategy. As an example , consider the archer unit. Elf archers suffer no range penalty, allowing them to do full damage even at distance. Draconian archers laugh firebombs which damage all units in small area. Goblin archers shoot homing mosquitoes which can go through obstacle. Dwarf archers have crossbows which do better damage when they are at close range. Orcs have the worst archers with the worst range; however, they can cause units to bleed which does damage overtime. As one can see, there is a clear difference in the unit abilities. Along with their class and race, players also choose specializations. These specializations revolve around elemental magic. Player can choose between air, fire, water, earth, creation, and destruction. Each specialization has global and combat spells as well as enchantment and summons. In the original game, there are two non-magic specializations-explorer and expander. These specializations add another level of strategy. When one considers all the race, class, and specializations, there is an astounding number of combinations and strategies to use to destroy one enemies. In my opinion, AoWIII is the best in the series. It’s one of my favorite games. On a final note, the devs are really involved in the community. They really listen to players and incorporate suggestions in the gameplay. Triumph Studios is an amazing studio. They have put a lot of work into this game and continue to do so.  "

												If you want a nice casual strategy, buy this game. But the tactics of fighting is extremely simplified compared to AoW 1|2.Here are some examples: 1. Earlier melee warrior could not attack flying creature. Now any swordsman kill a bird, probably he jumps well.2. Previously, to swim in the sea the ship was needed. Now each soldier has his ship in the pocket.3. In AoW 1|2 ghost was protected from physical attacks. Now just get less damage. Archer shot a ghost? Easily!And so on.As a result, we have another good strategy game, where you should not think. Just relax and have fun. Hamsters will be pleased!			"

												Buy it when its on sale if you decide to buy it at all.  Campaign mode has odd loosing conditions that the AI will take advantage of and makes the game more hard and frustrating than challenging. Playing keep away with your hero troops instead of useing them to lead battles. In single player mode its easy for all involved nations to hate you but its difficult if not impossible to repair reputation. For example if you come across a nation that declares war with you on sight, you loose reputation with all the other nations you know for starting a war when all you did is exist.  Ultimatly the game is is not very deep or engaging just long and frustrating.			"

I can see how in larger kingdoms, it would be grindy to personally manage all your cities. Would like to see some kinda system to setup Lords that have differing stats and AI settings.			"

												I'm very surprised this game didn't get more attention and praise when it came out. I guess it was somewhat overshadowed by Endless Legend, a game that's also excellent but very different in focus and pacing.Aside from an unintuitive UI and some goofy unit/character design, I really have nothing to complain about here. Each match on AoW3 is fun and satisfying from start to finish. The AI is competent and challenging. The combat is FANTASTIC, and for me it works very well as the focal point of the game. AoW3 might not be the deepest or most inventive 4X I've ever played, but it is definitely the most enjoyable. It really is a great experience, especially in the mid-late game when you're able to field powerful units and make tough tactical choices.Also, the expansions/DLC are fairly priced and add a huge amount of content and depth. I highly recommend picking up the full 'Collection' over the base gme.			"

												Jesus. I bought it only a few days ago and already have 45 hours of it played.It's a very entertaining and fun game. It has a lot of depth. In my opinion it's the best of its kind out the right now. There's some very similar games. Like.. the Might & Magic games. I think something like.. 'Warlock 3' was also a game of a similar genre. This definitely feels the best. I've played most of its peers, since the type of gameplay appeals to me a lot.If you like strategy games, definitely buy this. If you like games where you get to build a civilization, buy it.If you like card games, oddly enough, buy this. If you like chess, buy this.You don't have to be a genius to play this game, but if you're a genius you'll be able to play on the higher difficulties and have fun with those.There's lots to learn in this game, which is engaging and entertaining.

												I remember my days as a kid, I had just gotten a new copy of Heroes of Might and Magic III, even back then that game was old. But for me it was a new fresh experience that I'd never had before, it took me about a month to reliase that I could end the turn and didn't have to make a new game each time I'd finished my moves, but when I reliased this I suddently got really into the game, I spent almost 2 years playing that game non-stop... Ever since I've been looking for something similar, and Age of Wonders III is probably the best fantasy 4x game I've played in recent years, it succeeds in fullfilling my nostalgia with HOMM3 and I couldn't be more happy that I bought it. A strong recommend for anyone that is even slightly interested in 4x games with a focus on combat, hero customization and exploring.			"

												UPDATE: 23 Nov 2016Nominated for the ""Test of Time"" Steam Award!-------UPDATE: 17 Oct 2016After two expansions this has become one of my favorite games on my hard drive. There's a wide array of races and factions and combat possibility that keeps me coming back every day. The addition of PBEM (Play By EMail) was huge too, which was a part of the old games that I really enjoyed. Amazing game.--------Seriously love this game.  Age of Wonders III has the ""just one more turn"" addictiveness in spades, it's hard to put down once you get into a game.  There's a ton of content:  two long campaigns, many factions and spells, random maps, hundreds of units, all wrapped up in a pretty hex-based package.  Don't go in expecting the more intricate empire building of Civilization, though, Age of Wonders III is all about supporting your armies as they march across the map laying waste to your enemies.  The combat is rich, complex and varied and is the heart of Age of Wonders III.  Highly recommended.Oh, and the music is outstanding as well.  Buy it!			"

												I have been a fan of the Age of Wonders series since the very beginning. The series has been my favorite when it comes to strategy games. I was extremely excited when Triumph Studios announced the third installment of the series. I have watched the status of AOW III develop from the initial announcement up until release.So, here is my review based on 10 ours of in-game experience. I am extremely impressed with the AI. It is a much greater improvement over the original games. The AI is really taking me for run! I never had much challenge with the AI in the previous games. I like the detailed terrain and atmosphere of the maps/world. The tactical combats are sweet and prettier than the previous games. Also, the tactical AI is much smarter as well. In AOW II SM, I would lure enemies out of the gate in a siege and slaughter them... it doesn't work like that anymore. :D The AI is tough and smarter. The soundtrack is AWESOME! I wish I would have got the deluxe edition just for the soundtrack. I'll have to wait until they release it as DLC. I love how the knights look in AOW III. Their armor shines as they sit on their steeds with their lances; it brings a nice heroic personality. During the 10 hours of in-game experiences I have really enjoyed game. It is fun, exciting, and challenging. I rate it a 9/10 in my opinion.Here are some of the things I would suggest to improve AOW III. Angels... I really miss the angels from AOW II. Beautiful females, powerful, and celestial beings. They were my favorite unit, and I love how they could only be summoned. AOW III has angelic-like beings called the exalted. However, they just don't fit in the game as the female angels would. Another thing reflecting back upon the angels is that you can also get goblin angels, human angels, dwarf angels, etc... This is due to the new class system in AOW III. Angels, succubus, etc need to be unique, and preferably summoned instead of being standard recruitable creatures. I am hoping Triumph will bring back the angels from AOW II as summons. :) Another thing I would suggest is to bring back the old method of handling flying creatures. In AOW II you needed magic, another flying unit, ranged units, or for the flying unit to attack you in order to deal damage to a flying unit. Based on what I have seen all creatures whether flying or not can hit a flying unit. Lastly, I do prefer the 2d art for heroes and leaders as compared to the 3d stuff (lowest priority).In conclusion, Age of Wonders III is a solid game that will bring an exciting and challenging experience. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to support Triumph Studio on further development of Age of Wonders III! 9/10!			"

												Age of Wonders III has really managed to hit my itch for a great game. There are seemingly infinite customization combinations  for creating a random map. I have counted 36 race/class(6x6) combos and then there are the specializations, all of which can have a pretty big impact on how your character's empire will be played. Editing the physical appearance of your character is kind of limited in my opinion but that did not ruin anything for me, i had already spent a half an hour debating what I would play first. Adding to the changing of physical appearance items crafted and found while playing will show on your character (only in battle i think). The AI has proven to be a challenge for me, to keep it simple they don't seem to play fair or nice things have gone poorly for me several times. The fourth difficulty which I believe is called 'king' is too much for me currently. I do a lot of empire building, and i have played with the scenarios however i haven't played though either of the two stories yet. When building my empire in a random map I find myself ready to sit there for hours leading my character and other heroes on a quests to help and save cities and then conquer those who don't want peace. I have logged in around 40 hours so far, much of which was spent using local multiplayer. All of my friends around here play consoles but a few do enjoy games like this one so it was great being able to have them over and play this. Turns can get pretty long late game (using classic turn based system opposed to simultaneous) on the bigger maps but when all you have to do is past a wireless mouse back and forth its easy to do other things while waiting. Even so between turns waiting on the AI doesn't take nearly as long many other games similar to this style I've played.I'm actually bored of writing this now and really want to go play more Age of Wonders III before i start my day, so take care everyone and if you haven't checked out this game I seriously suggest you do. Really you guys/girls/lords/ladies...do it right the frack now! Go play as a goblin dreadnought and blow some things up you'll have loads of fun! and nothing beats fun...			"

												A fun, somewhat, competent 4x game that puts a large focus on warfare, Age of Wonders 3 is a great game if you don't look too closely at the seams. In my time playing there are a few concerns that have grown over time and kept this game from being great.Among these is the enormous focus on warfare. In short, if you are not building towards better units you are doing the wrong thing. Powerful units are paramount for combat of course, but on top of that, there really isn't any other option. Religion? Non-existent. Economy? There are two or three buildings, tops, that will generate any sort of capital. In fact, this makes city placement one of the most important parts of the game; as they dictate what materials you can get at the city.This brings me nicely to the second problem with the game; enemy AI. The AI in this game is hilarious. They will jump eagerly off their walls during sieges. They will run tword your town only to see that it is a bit large and then do circuits, a bit confused at what they are to do. You will repeatedly see your teammate lose battles because, for some reason, they decided to send a single hero into a group of tier three monsters. Finally, they will neglect to clear monsters from the resource nodes around their cities for literally dozens of turns thereby starving themselves of resources.And that is what really kills the game for me. I build up a great army (because I have too) to fight opponents too stupid to even keep their resources clear to fund an army that will literally jump from their own battlements.All of that said, this isn't a terrible game. There is a good sense of involvement in combat, and a great deal of strategy especially due to the flanking system that is missing from other games such as FELH. Those who are expecting a full fledged 4x experience would probably be served better elsewhere, but if you are a fan of tabletop battle games then Age of Wonders Three is a very fun combat simulator for a fraction of the cost. Hopefully the upcoming patch fixes a lot of the issues so that I can change the more negative aspects of this review, but as the game stands it is a 7/10 for me. Buy it only if you are not expecting a ""pure"" 4x experience.EDIT UPDATE 1.09:Update 1.09 has hit and there have been a lot of quality of life enhancements. Enemy AI has improved dramatically in regards to walls, and sieges in general, and I have noticed my allies actively clearing nodes beyond just the first time they settle an area. It still doesn't happen as frequently as I feel it should, but that may be because I am playing on ""Lord"" difficulty (sort of mid tier) for the random matches.I have, however, noticed more problems that escaped me on the outset, especially in regards to diplomacy and how NPCs decide how much they like you. One of my biggest gripes at this point is that if an enemy dislikes you it is nearly impossible to have them change their opinion. This is agravated by the fact that declaring war on anything, including independent units, is looked upon very poorly by the AI. For example, I gifted an NPC money every turn for nearly twenty turns and they still were ""distrustful"" of me since I claimed an independent city. Furthermore, NPCs that like you think you are a god beyond reproach. I purchased half of my allies cities for a pittance (literally not even a turns worth of mana) and there wasn't even a change to his diplomatic value. Another thing to note is if you are allies and at peace with an NPC if you wish to attack them you will have to wait two full turns before being able to actually attack. This makes it so that alliances are very difficult to break, and prevents any sort of subterfuge which I find disappointing. That is definitely more of a personal issue, but it feels a bit out of place in such a war based game and prevents surprise invasions. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a carry over from the multiplayer.Another issue I have is that certain classes and races seem to have serious advantages; specifically the druids and elves. The druid tier 4 summon has an ability called thunderstrike that can be used across the field, has a chance to stun, is an AoE, and is on a three turn cooldown. Combine this with the elf passive of not suffering the ranged damage penalty and you have a very dominate long range army even when made of low tier units. In comparison, the theocrat class seems to be very underpowered; mostly due to a more melee and passive overworld bonus focus. It just seems like a poor fit since the overworld is so disappointing overall and the siege focus late game. I would expect major changes in DLC for how this class functions.My previous positive statements about this game still stand though and due to the better siege mechanics I will now give the game an 8/10. Sieges are now very engaging, and stressful, affairs where you will have to carefully time when and where you are going to hit the enemies defenses rather than taking pot-shots at suicidal archers. Again, this is not a game to purchase if you want to have a good overworld experience; it simply cant deliver that at this point in its life.			"

												The most awesome aspect of this game is the joint tactical battles. If the game creators take one thing away from the game, it would be squad building and turn based strategy with multiple players. You could create a spinnoff game where players command small tactical insurgent forces for some missions and large seige forces for others, with a smattering of mid level combat around towns and villages. It would be incredible to play with multiple friends, explore and find new and amazing treasures and defeat incredible mythical beasts.			"

												A 4x with a heavy emphasis on combat. Feels almost like a Warcraft III meets Fire Emblem with a dash of empire-building. Your hero leads armies and can produce units at your cities or buy them from inns; the hero also levels up and gains abilities. You manage mana, gold, action points and research. You pick a race, a class, and three specializations. Light on diplomacy and intrigue, heavy on bloodshed and explosions.In my most recent round a volcano's worth of dragons ASKED to join my faction.			"

												It is said that in a franchise, the 3rd installement reveals the truth in it. AoW3 does not disappoint, quite the opposite. I heartily recommend you get this awesome game in your library (DLC's also really add value and are totally worth the price).

												This is the best hex-style turn based strategy game I have played. The game offers very distinct empire classes to play, each with a very unique playstyle and unit set. You can also select a race which augments your class by giving your base units special traits and skills. Every class is surprisingly balanced with the exception of Dreadnought, which is significanty overpowered.What I love most about this game is its combat system which is very deep but at the same time completely transparent. All units possess unique traits and interactions which if leveraged perfectly, can turn a likely defeat into a flawless victory. Units can level up and earn promotions that give them not just plain stats, but additional skills and traits making them more suited to their combat role. The addition of a wide array of global combat spells also adds depth to the game.This game is a must buy if you enjoy games like Civ, or if you want a game similar to the HoMM series but with balanced gameplay and game depth.

												Great game, good blend of overworld strategy and turn based battles.The magic and ""class"" abilities definitely help mix things up and give it a great amount of replayablity, as well as facilitating different types of tactics.The games strongest suite is that you can mix race units, class units, and magical abilities very interchangably, allowing for a very wide combination of different tactics and playstyles.I'd very highly reccomend this game, if you liked shadow magic this has a lot of what made that game great but with some of the annoying bits improved.Great game overall.

												This is a triumph for the AoW series. It is not a re-hash of the old model whatsoever. The system of play has been totally overhauled and it is a very refreshing new approach to the series. I might go so far to say it is better than AoW 1. It combines elements familiar to Civilization players with great RPG-focused gameplay, there is a much greater focus on the kings/queens of empires in AoW 3 than before; where they were merely another hero with a special title. I strongly reccomend this title, it's been a blast to play.			"

												I have 342 hours into the game as of this review, and have only played single player.  This is easily the most played game in my Steam library. (Skyrim comes in at 2nd, with about 275 hours as of this review.  And whatever is in 3rd place is so far back, it can't even see the dust from these two.)  I find this funny, since I almost passed on buying AoW3.This is a deep game, which took me about 60 hours just to feel like I was getting the feel of all the possibilities.  The intro campaign got a bit tedious by about the 4th chapter, so I jumped into random maps.  Very enjoyable!  Just about anything you can think of is customizable, including your leader's race, specialty, and appearance; to map type, size and features (the map can be dangerous and rewarding... at the same time); to number of heros allowed and their max levels...  Oh yes, and the number, skill and specialties of your A.I. opponents are individually tweakable.  Basically, after you haved played a bit, each random map is a game you can fully and intelligently customize to optimize the challenge and maximize your own enjoyment.The strategy level is turn-based or semi-real time (selectable) and the combat is turn-based.  Decisions you make at the strategy/map level greatly influence numbers and capabilities of troops you field.  The tactical combat is deep.  With the right skills and knowledge, you can defeat far superior opponents (or vice versa: you can get your fanny kicked by an inferior opponent).  Your opponents are scalable in toughness, and total defeat is definitely an option.  Making the right decisions at both the strategic and tactical levels makes for very satisfying play.A lot of attention was given to the audio and visual experience.  The map and game pieces are beautiful.  Every troop has its own unque sounds and animations for different actions, including combat.  There is a bit of an RPG element --> Heros and leaders get stronger if you cultivate them, have many different capabilities, based on class, and really can make a big difference in battle outcomes.Due to the fact that I think the tutorial campaign could have been a little more ""teachy"" AND interesting, I lower my ranking a bit below perfect, and give this game a rating of 9 out of 10.

												I am always coming back to this game. It has a great combat system, fantastic empire building, and diverse units. The fact that modding is open for the game also gives it tons of replay value. I can never get enough of trying new mods and having the game randomly generate new maps. It keeps itself fresh even after 600+ hours of gameplay. If you're interested in any kind of fantasy at all, I reccommend picking AoW III up. Get it with the DLCs and have fun wasting your life away because you need to play just ONE more turn. You can create your own heroes or use pre-designed heroes, create your own emblem too. There's a ton of customization and versatility with your hero as well as what units you create and when. Mods enhance your gameplay 100% so I reccommend browsing the workshop. Just subscribe to whatever sounds cool and when you pull up AoW, just tell it to update the user content.This game is awesome for multiplayer too. Just hang out together with friends or family and take turns passing around the mouse. You can be on a team, you can play online with randoms; the game even tells you what mods the other person is running so that there won't be any compatibility errors. Plus accessing your mods is super easy. I have little to no experience modding and I have like 15 going at one time right now. No, I don't have a super computer.All I can say is beware if you create a gigantic map, the AI will take exponentially longer on their turn the longer the game progresses. One more warning; if you are playing with mods and you want to play a game with someone who has no mods, create a new map with one of the preexisting heroes and save it. That way it has the pre-created hero on the start-up screen. If you have a custom hero on the start-up screen after turning off your mods, the game will crash.Freaking love this game and will always reccommend it to anyone.			"

												After putting over 250 hours into this game (unmodded): The main draw is the Random maps, if you sink some time into those and view the campaign as a ""challenge mode"" you will really enjoy this game. The city building and expansion aspects are complicated enough to be interesting while simple enough that the focus remains on the combat. I really wish the game let you do the ""pre-deployment"" kind of like the total war games. I occasionally disliked how my troops started in strange formations. But I highly recommend you buy this game if you enjoy turn based magical tactical combat.			"

												I strongly recommend this game. The variety of strategies and choices is outstanding. Every hero, race and unit feels very unique. Every expansion improved the base game really fine.Age of Wonders III feels really  different from other turn strategy when we look at battle mechanics. I can't say how good it feels in my hands. In a battle with 32+ units, one badly unit move can turn the tides.And after almost two campaign I still have not experienced a single major bug.However, after two year of paths and ballancing, it still has some flaws, for example:- Tier IV units making tier I units almosts useless in late game- Limited controls. There's too many repetitive mouse actions that can't mapped to a hotkey.- Some of campaign levels are way too long. Managing 10+ cities is not funny while hunting enemies heroes around other 10+ cities.			"

The combat is also very rewarding once you get the hang of it. I particularly like that my units don't feel like fodder.

												I love this game, but I can't reccomend buying it.here's why:I've played it for far longer than my account says, loved every second of it, the reason for this is that I pirated it, not something I'm proud of but It ties in. I pirated it, played it for hours, most likely in the hundreds, and then because I liked it so much I decided to buy it, if nothing else to support the creators.and then I discoverd that there was a map that was pre-order exclusive, I've looked around at forums and they said they would release it later, maybe as a bundle. They haven't done this, at least not on steam.so, I'm left with a lighter wallet and an incomplete version of the game, with no hope of ever completing it.I am currently playing the pirated version, as it has all the content and is objetivly superiour at this point.feel free to buy it to support the creators like I did, I felt like I had to after playing a pirated version. but the steam version as it is, is not complete, you won't ever have all the content and that takes the enjoyment out of the steam version for me.still going to put up that I enjoy the game, because it is one of my favorite games of all time, and you should play it either way.

												Good turn based tactical strategy with RPG mechanics, kinda similar for a first look as HoMaM franchise but on the second one there is so varying diferences that AoW stands on it's own.+ Story ~ campaing is fluent and well written (yet I prefer random maps more)+ Graphic ~ optimized and beatiful at the same time+ Customize your main hero ~ you can make your very own hero, randomize pre-builded one or just choose from the list+ Classic fantasy races+ Spell system ~ global and combat alike+ Developers are still adding free content, patches and paid DLC's at the same time & community workshop- Basically a tech race ~ rush for better technology tier of units is almost always win and often mandatory - For multiplayer is not advised to play with strangers (not so many games without passwords anyway) because of rage quits, disconnects if something is not by their minds etc. Although groups looking for play, especially for longer and steady plays, are made on forum so it....balances a bit8/10   ""Always plays as evil dwarf dreadnought machines freak.

												This game is addictive as hell. Whether youre a fan of the old series, as i am, or a newcomer who enjoys 4X games, Age of Wonders III will keep you persistently hungry for ""one more turn"". I have not played the campaign much (i never do in these games) but the skirmish/random map mode is exactly what i want out of games like this.Exploration is very rewarding in AOW3, as each randomly generated world feels rich and large. Whatever method, pattern, or logic it is that the world generator uses, it does its job; mountains, forests, and rivers all fit very naturally together, have plenty of variety with sensibly placed climates/regions, and just look wonderful. The resources are spaced and balanced really well, and there are tons of dungeons and rare encounters to discover and conquer. I always get absorbed in roaming the world, every time.Hero creation is fun. The classes are mostly what you are used to (warriors, wizards, priests, etc), but there are many combinations of race/class/specializations available whos impacts on the game are felt gradually over the course of your campaign, and every change can have a major impact on how you play, so it is easy to get excited about trying out each one. Personally, i spend almost as much time creating heroes and imagining up personalities for them as i do actually playing the game (LOL), and the fact that i can make them, not only for myself, but for the NPCs as well really gets me into the game alot more than i would be otherwise.There are plenty of spells, including hidden ones, plenty of items and equipment, including some you make yourself, and plenty of monsters, most of which you can learn to either capture or acquire for your own armies. Some units have unique abilities when certain classes and races combine to produce them, and each hero can be customized with RPG-style level-upgrades and equipment. There are also rare units which can only be discovered through exploration, or by conquering/befreinding key locations, so even play throughs with the same customized faction will vary and feel different.The tactical combat is better than i have seen in a 4X game in a long time. Many different unit roles exist, with a variety of strengths and positions which counter them, and each has advantages at different times. Combined with heroes and spells, there are many things to think about in battle, and many strategies to win with. The sheer number of unit abilities in this game is impressive in its own right, but once you begin to realize that every single one of them counters, and is countered by, something else, things move to a whole new level. The action-point and flanking systems ensure that you cannot simply hire a few beefy units and chop your way through hordes of enemies... there is a limit to how much one badass can do in a turn, and you WILL be outmaneuvered and killed by cheap little weaklings if you do not position your units correctly.If i had to complain about something in this game, i could only think of two things to mention. Firstly, the diplomacy mechanics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ To be fair, they usually are in 4X games; diplomacy rarely ever gets implimented well into games which are mostly designed around combat but, in this case, it feels especially worthless. Most NPCs will decide whether or not they are at war with you before you even open the diplomacy screen, and once it has been decided there is really nothing you can do to change things. There isnt much you can trade, and NPCs will typically never accept a trade anyway, so this much of the game may as well be removed.And Secondly, the difficulty of the game is spasmatic at best. One game, you may walk over everyone else as though they werent even there, and the next you may be clinging to life every turn; there seems to be no consistency even within the same difficulty levels of this game. I have had several matches where i have spent hours exploring the world only to find one of the enemy factions tucked away in a corner of the map repeatedly failing to extablish a second city for some reason or another, and i have also had matches where all of my cities were under constant siege by max level units before i had even located an enemy. It is wildly inconsistent and, if you do not limit the number of heroes a faction may have, AI factions will hire as many as they can afford to the exclusion of everything else.But, the game is amazing and has only been getting better with each patch. As far as i am concerned, there is no better 4X available right now, and it is worth the full price of 40 dollars. If you catch this thing on sale, you would be a fool to pass it up.			"

												As someone who cut their teeth on Master of Magic on my first PC, I can definitely recommend Age of Wonders 3 to both old fans of the genre and folks getting into it for the first time.  The clean visual look and easy to follow unit art combines well with a deeply layered strategy game that has an amazing depth of content, particularly with both DLC packages included.The top layer of the game is all about strategy - building up your empire, expanding your cities reach, marshalling a vast army of armored elves, lucky halflings, or agile tigrans and assaulting dungeons and tombs for ancient treasure while balancing your diplomacy and maintaining an alignment that may influence your neighbors opinion of you (if you even care what they think - especially if your goal is to crush them like a bug).  When you get into battle with an opposing force, the game really shines again with a powerful tactical layer - positioning your units to defend their flanks and take advantage of your enemies over-reaching become as important as fielding the proper units.  Pikes deployed against mounted cavalry works brilliantly, especially if you can get behind a spent and exhaused human Knight!  Then again, a well placed fireball can work wonders, as well.The races and classes are many and varied, and with one amazing spell or ability to research after another regardless of the combination you select at map setup you'll play for hundreds of hours before you start to see all the combinations.  From Warlords and their incredibly potent troops to Necromancers and Sorcerers with their poweful magic and mighty summons, including Dread Reapers and Eldrich Horrors, there is something here for all types of strategy gamers.The multi-player in simultaneous mode works wonders - especially if you are playing with friends on teams, it takes a long time to complete a game but it's just an amazing half a dozen hours to spend.In the end, I've probably spent as much time watching videos as I have playing it, and I am looking forward to many more years of both - there is a lot to learn, and a lot to dig into, but the basics are simple and elegant and the longeveity of the game is definitely something worth considering.  Highly recommended.			"

												I believe the finest fantasy TBS we have at the moment.Heavily focused on epic battles, exploration and leveling up your heroes. That's where its core is! Every class and race play differently with their pros and cons so gameplay and replayability are kept alive and fresh by the ""let me try this now!"" factor.City management is secondary, but not irrilevant: you'll find yourself specializing cities and terraforming here and there to suit them to your strategy and playstyle.It'll completely suck you in and if you've a friend to play with it's even better! MP goes on at a VERY slow pace, especially when it's more than 3 Leaders involved, but the pause between turns gives you time to do other things like reading a book, watching a video or a movie, checking the Tome of Wonders, planning next moves and so forth... so its apparently weak spot is instead another of its great points.AI is a bit weird at times but it reacts and listens to your request and proposals pretty well. So forge alliances, betray, bribe other factions and set them at war against your opponents. Level up your Heroes, send them afar to expand your domains and rule the land with the iron grip and brute force of the Orcs! Or dwell in the underground and patiently multiply your Goblins waiting to erupt to the surface and destroy the land of men!Cleanse the earth and bring peace in all the Empire as the Leader of High Elves or forge incredible machines that will shake the ground beneath their wheels and crush your enemies as a Dwarven Dreadnought! Seriously... never had had this fun in a long time!!Highly recommended!			"

												Do not expect the deep empire management of civilization, this game's strong side is in its combat system, magic system and customization options. You can customize your own avatar and the choice of talents, class and race have significant impact to how your game will play out, allowing to pick a combination most suited to your playstyle. Or just experiment if that's your thing.As mentioned, the empire management aspects are lacking compared to the competition. Tech tree gets exhausted pretty quickly and it's pretty easy to win by overpowering the AI in early game. On the other hand this kind of setup allows for faster and more 'action' oriented multiplayer matches. However the AI is notoriously bad in terms of diplomacy and still has some bugs that make it easy to beat even on higher difficulties. Add to that an incomplete diplomatic system and the only real option to win the game outside of scripted scenarios is full on military conquest.The best part however is the combat system. Units are carefully balanced and the combat system allows to win through superior tactics against much more powerful armies... if you know what you're doing. Finding out the various tactics to take down particularly tough units is half the fun. Defending a city surrounded assaulted by a superior foe is suitably satisfying, as is taking out defenders through tactical use of the right units.Overal: Age of Wonders 3 is a Heroes of Might and Magic meets Civilization in a Tolkien-ish inspired setting. Don't get it for the empire management or you'll be disappointed. Get it for the combat and magic system and it's loads of fun.			"

												This game isn't perfect, but I think it is a good followup on the old AoW games. I really like the class system and the classes do play very differently. Magical spheres are still around though they are more of a complement to the class spells and abilities now. Race has a lot less impact than class admittedly, but there are enough differences between the races that the choice matters.  That aside, the tactical combat is very good and has some interesting additions compared to the old games.The game is in need of some patching, and could definetly use some expansions/DLC with more of the old races (Tigrans naturally) being added. One of my main annoyances however is that the unit design is fairly lazy, at least for the class units. Most theocrat and warlord units for instance are bald for all races, they could have had some variation there. Skinny hairless elven angels do not scream exalted to me. =P			"

												What a wonder indeed. I've been waiting for a game that's close to Heroes of Might and Magic 3 for so long. The Heroes of Might and Magic series itself has let me down in every installment after the third one. I've been playing for several hours and not once have I wanted to put the game down, I just had to because I have stuff to do. I have nothing bad to say about the game really, it reaches top marks on pretty much everything that's important in a game like this. One thing I would've liked though is more races. Where is the undead race for example? Maybe they'll keep supporting this game with expansions and patches we'll see but for now I'm having a blast.			"

												Easily the best 4x fantasy game since the last in the series: Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic. However the real question is AOW III better than that game or not. It is hard to really say, with the current more limited number of races included and some changes that seem to speed the game up a bit, I would say it is not better as a whole than Shadow Magic but it is pretty damn close as it stands right now and on its own merits it is an amazingly deep and polished 4x fantasy game and the closest you will find to a true modern Master of Magic. If they do open up steam workshop support for this title and/or add more races/classes/units it will be a near perfect game.			"

												This game is staying true to the series while improving on them.There are other reviews that focus on the game aspect and are quite descriptive, so I will not linger on this too much.The game is big, gives you many different ways to develop your heroes and you can follow a diverse amount of tactics in the game.The graphics are great. The sound is great. The UI is great. Almost everything is at the point of your cursor or a click away.But, what is the greatest thing about this game is the developers and the support they give in the game and to their customers. They monitor the forums and address every problem in a speedy way. They listen to the feedback and try to fix whatever little does not work as it should.They release DLCs that *add to the game* while they release updates that *fix the game*.I am impresed by Triumph on this aspect and I think that they are a model of how a company should support their titles.It is certain that I will be following this company's releases and I will support their work in the future, as long as they keep this quality level. I wish there were more companies like that.			"

												Lovely game. I enjoyed the tutorial immensely. This is a hybrid of Heroes of Might and Magic and Civilization, 2 games that I also enjoy. I prefer the textured map of Heroes of Might and Magic rather than the flat map system of Civilizations. Being able to see the rivers, mountains, streams and the underground make for a much more interesting game. PROS1. The Zoomed In Combat SystemI love this. Combat is based on an Action Point system and is slightly better compared to similar combat systems from 4X games like Endless Legends. You have elevation, terrain, range and spells and even strategic positioning. E.g. If you were to attack an enemy Hero with 2 armies on the left and right flank, the armies will appear on the right and left flank of the enemy as well.2. Feedback ButtonI love the consideration that the developers put in for their players. While I'm sure that the developers aren't able to attend to all feedback, it is a good idea for players to give their feedback. Also, if I ever need to report bugs, this makes it easy to do. Alternatively, F12 works as well.3. Textured Map vs Flat MapYou get to see details versus a plain flat map.4. Lore and ThemeI love the Dreadnought.5. Wall ClimbingVery nice. I like the climbing of walls. It's something that's not in Civilizations or Heroes. Not that it's very useful. I'm guessing Total War has had a small impact here?6. Scout CreaturesPrety useful.7. Expanding your Territory with BuildersNot bad, but not perfect. Instead of using builders for roads and industrial upgrades, you build settlements that increase your city's domain. Compared to buying tiles with culture, it's much better. However, the builders need to be given instructions, otherwise they are pieces of junk. If you don't expand, it stands around doing nothing.8. Spells instead of TechnologyNot bad. It's thematically more interesting.9. Multiple heroes in CombatLove it, although I am unsure if hero bonuses stack on troops.CONS1. Unintuitive ClickingNo auto-pickup. You have to pick it up on your own with a left click and then place it in your inventory. Why can't you just auto-pick it up if you have inventory space?2. RegistrationPain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I understand that you need to use it to link with GOG and Steam though.3. Equipping itemsWhy is the bow in your inventory and not held in your hand? Do you go into combat with your weapon stashed in your bag?4. Cliche RacesGoblins, Elves, Orcs, Humans, Dwarves? How much Tolkien do you want to repeat?5. No Parallel BuildsYou can only ever build 1 thing at anytime. Why can't you make an upgrade that builds 2 things at once? E.g. 2 infantry will pop up in a single turn. 6. Spellcasting in CombatIf I'm right, only 1 spell can be used per round. Having 2 heroes that can cast spells is redundant. I may have to double-check on this. "

												This game is awesome. Heroes of Might and Magic meets Civ meets Disciples meets turn based combat. Units have multiple levels of veterancy. Heroes can level up, use spells of multiple school trees, use items they find in battle, and make items to use in battle. A no brainer for 50% off or more. That said, I haven't played Endless Legend yet which is also by an amazing production company and JUST came out of Alpha. Then again, it isn't 50% off right now with an expansion coming out tomorrow.			"

												Absolutely amazing. This is definitely one of the better strategy games you get on steam. This game is on par with Civ V or  maybe even better. The combat is fun, the customization is fun, taking cities is rewarding and each game is different in its own way. The visuals are fantastic and the tactical combat is extremely well done. It rarely gets boring since all minor conflicts can be solved through an auto-calculation so it never gets tedious. Plus the auto-calculations are usually pretty fair and that's a huge plus compared to other games that have tried this feature.  If you're a fan of strategy or even just fantasy this is a must-buy. I can't believe this game isn't more popular than it is. Steam and really the entire 4x scene should have more games like this and would benefit greatly from it.			"

The terraforming magic ability where a type of environment creeps out of your cities with each turn is one of my favorite in gaming, especially the terraforming WMD spells in the old AoW games.Excuse me while I go create a Tigran Necromancer named Nagash and take over the world with my undead legions and immortal undead heroes.

Initial Overall ThoughtsTwo years have passed since I was gifted the base game of AOW and purchased the expansions along the way. I’ve put in over 100 hours of play in the single player campaigns, online and play-by-email multiplayer modes. I’d say I spent most of my time in online multiplayer. From the get-go, I was already enjoying this entry and I think it’s for the simple reason that there aren’t a lot of 4X strategy titles like this on the market. The blending of RPG, 4X and Empire Building mechanics is still rare despite the resurgence of turn-based games in recent years. Age of Wonders seems keen on proving that it still deserves its place.This is the kind of strategy game I like to sink an entire Sunday afternoon and evening into. Where time simply goes by completely unawares. I get sucked into managing my noble empire of good Humans against the undead scourge of the evil Necromancer (aka: Managarmr). That one-more-turn addiction is ever present and I’ve burned many happy days trying to explore, determine the next resource to take over, training armies and expanding the empire as best as I could. With the random procedural generation, each match will feel unique, even when playing on the same map settings. Just the experience of roleplaying a fantasy character, that’s in charge of any number of types of empires,was engaging on its own. However, maybe that’s the roleplayer in me talking. Evil, neutral, chaotic, elemental, destructive, good or peace-seeking, the game allows you to build your own experience and try to play to the conditions you set for yourself. I’ll explain more in the mechanics below.AOW3 is about victory through expansion, fighting and conquest. As the leader of a powerful empire, you should always be exploring to find hidden treasures and places to setup new cities. To expand your empire as quickly as possible by taking over resource buildings and conquering your foes. You should move quickly or else you’ll get left behind. The basic structure of your empire are towns, cities and outposts. These places let you build units, upgrades and more that grant access to more powerful units, increasing your revenue streams and giving permanence to your empire. Which you’ll need for the army and taking over rival Throne Cities. Even with the alternate victory conditions brought about in the expansions, military prowess is what the game favors for victory. The diplomacy system is simplistic. It gives the very basic functions of diplomacy (declare war, allow armies through territories, etc) and that’s about it. It also provides a way to talk to players if needed. Otherwise, the AI doesn’t use it very well and trying to barter with it is near impossible. Side note, you could technically win a victory through peaceful means, but that would require forging alliances with other players who win the game for you. It’s not that enjoyable nor encouraged by the game or myself.Leader, Heroes and Units ExaminationEach player controls an empire led by a Leader, a powerful character with vast control over their elemental and racial magic. These leaders can function in the role of a supporting hero or go on the offensive in the front lines with spells and abilities. They can also ride mounts, equip weapons, items & armor as well as level up. During the game they are casting spells that can affect cities or other units as well as learning new spells through knowledge research. There are plenty of spells to learn from not only based on their class but their specialization and race. They are your most powerful units but they are also a potentially crippling weakpoint of your empire. If taken out, they can no longer cast their spells, research is stopped dead and whatever existing spells are cancelled. Leaders will return in a couple of days at their home base but that leaves the empire vulnerable to attack and can slow everything down to a crawl. Generally, it’s a good idea to not lose them. You can completely customize their appearance, race, class and specialties or pick from several defaults included in the game. The leader builder in the game is definitely good if not the most powerful I’ve ever seen. I’ve created several unique heroes and always liked coming up with new ideas for mine.Final ThoughtsAge of Wonders III combines empire building, role-playing mechanics and turn-based strategy into one glorious mix. I don’t regret the 100+ hours I’ve sunken into it. It’s got great multiplayer support and a pretty decent multiplayer community to go along with it. The sheer amount of content that you can find is incredible as well. I haven’t even touched on everything I could have in this review. I’m going to keep playing Age of Wonders 3 in the future even if I do have reservations about its pacing. What AOW3 does right far outweighs what it does wrong and it’s been a hell of a memorable experience. I just wish the early game’s battles were more interesting and less one sided. I additionally wish magic was a little less restrictive and more interesting in the early game as well. The game only really seems to get interesting once you hit mid-to-late game levels. But maybe that’s just me. The RNG system is robust and fair along with the game’s overall balance giving players a more-or-less equal chance to win. At least, from what I can tell of my 100 hour experience.Far and away Age of Wonders III is one of my top strategy games of all time. It’s memorable for all the right reasons despite its flaws and shortcomings. I heartily recommend it for both new and experienced 4X strategy players. This is well worth giving a look.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] "

												Now that I've completed both campaigns, I would have expected to be strongly recommending this game to others.Unfortunately, I have a real love/hate relationship with this game. Much of the game is great - the grpahics, interface, music and basic gameplay elements. You certainly won't lack for gameplay, the two campaigns took me well over 100 hours to finish, although I never use auto combat so battles made up most of that time.The hate part comes from the lack of documenation and a few really terrible scenarios in the campaigns. All games should have a manual, especially games this complex, but there is no manual.Three of twelve scenarios in the campaigns are awful, some of the worst scenario designs I have encountered in decades of playing strategy games, the rest of the scenarios are lots of fun. One is horrible because it has a hidden timer. The other two, the last scenarios in each campaign are horrible because they are mind numbingly frustrating. You have far too many enemies to fight, your basic task is to fight two leaders and attack them with a particular hero. Finding the two leaders is a slow, boring process. It's an idiotic idea which pretty much ruined both campaigns for me. If you are lucky you won't have to play these scenarios, it depends on choices you make earlier in the campaigns.I do recommend this game if you are willing to put up with some frustration.			"

												The game shows alot of promise, and I was totally sold on it from the trailers. But truth be told, the actuall combat mechanics and AI leaves much to be desired. The different races all play the same, with mostly the same units to choose from, and it doesnt help that you can absorb any race into your empire and as such actaully play all races in one single game. The different classes have some different spells and units to choose from, but spells in general are a bit of a letdown. You generally use the same two spells over and over again since there is no point in using anything else. Same with units, some units are way OP and when the enemy only build these units there is no point in creating diverse armies for the fun of it. Units dont have many special abilities, and the lower tiers become obsolete quickly. One cool thing is that you can absorb the ""special"" NPC races such as dragons, giants and undead into your empire if you take one of their towns. On a strategic note, you need to learn how to use your units to their full extent, and pay atention to flanking since this plays a major role in combat. Unfortenetly units with lots of HP generally have high dmg aswell, so using week dps units are just not an option in the long run, bigger is always better in this game. Verdict: Has some good ideas, and the game looks good. But after playing one custom map against the computer, you have basiclly experienced all there is to it. So good fun for 3-5 hours, then you forget about it.			"

												In brief: A game with a fantastic concept that lacks the depth and balance to hold the player's attention.In not so brief:I was really excited about this game. I saw some gameplay and got it on the Steam Winter Sale after waiting forever for the price to drop. I was excited by the combination of strategic overworld combined with tactical combat and thought it would make for dynamic and immersive gameplay. To go with the Civilization comparison I had always wished the combat there was more detailed / more engaging and I thought this was the answer. Unfortunately I fails to live up to expectations.You choose class and race and those determine what ""special units"" you get and some specialized bonuses and abilities. Unfortunately, the special units are little more than reskins of the same basic types. You have infantry, calvary, and archers. And your specialized units are only ""special"" in a few details. Once you get to mid-game you've figured out the most efficient way to conduct your battles in the tactical map and so just rinse-and-repeat through the entire late-game. You end up hitting ""auto-combat"" more and more because it's no longer exctiting to spend 7 minutes to crush some bandits. And at that ponit you're no longer even playing the tactical portion. Every tactical map is effectively the same, and so each battle progresses the same way.There is no other choice than ""crush all your enemies in combat"". While in Civ you can win through economics, diplomacy, or culture, in AoW III it is ONLY through conquest. Well that's fine, right? Because you came to play a fantasy strategic/tactical combat game. That's what I thought. But this affects the AI a LOT. Peace treaties are a joke. The AI will propose them, and then break them only a few turns later. There's no real penalty for doing so and in the end they have no other choice. They HAVE to fight you at some point. So forming alliances in game doesn't really work. As a result, the AI is pumping out units at a high rate. Which just turns the game into an arms race. You don't have time to focus on the unique terraforming spells or anything that's not directly combat related. It's just a sprint to get to late-game units so you can stand up to the AI. Which means you probably get there before even exploring the entire map. So the late game is dominated by just cleaning up the rest of your opponents. Sure, now you have the flexibility to play with terraforming or something, but why bother? The game is almost over.One final thing is that some of the background game mechanics are broken. Empire Happiness is notably problematic. You gain happiness for a number of things but most importantly for conquering other cities. You lose happiness for such things as losing cities. Happiness determines how well your troops perform in combat. The result of this is that once you get an enemy on their heels it's lights out. It becomes a runaway effect where you just get better and better and they get worse and worse. Instead of long campaigns being tiring for your troops, it's almost invigorating. Additionally, your throne city is EVERYTHING. As in, if you lose that, you lose it all. Literally. Keeping your throne city is a victory requirement. So you can't turtle in a lesser city off to the side to make a brilliant comeback later. If you lose that it's game over. So the easiest way to defeat an opponent is to walk past all of their other cities, go right to their throne, and take it. The end.I could say more but this review is already overly long. I really, deeply wish I could recommend this game, but it's simply not worth it. Like I said a fantastic concept that falls flat when it comes to execution. If you want to play a turn-based strategy game, play Civ. If you want to play a turn based tactical game, play X-COM. If you want to play a fusion of the two, wait for something better to come along.			"

												Well, what can I say?There is no better fantasy strategy game out there. Heroes of Might and Magic (the new ones) would wish they were that good.This game not only did what the first Age of Wonders did right, it does everything better.Battles of epic proportions, upgradable heroes and minions, a great ammount of various races and units plus specialities, spells, freedom to create your own towns, deciding what to specialize at, using terrain tactically, flanking and joining several armies around the target to fight with 2 or 3 heroes at the same time... That's just from the top of my head. This game is a real time stealer...With those kinds of games I am usually hard to please, but this time I am shocked at how good this is.Unlike the first games it is not only good techically, but story-wise as well. Keeps you entertained for sure.As far as fantasy strategy games go? This is 10/10 right there.			"

												What can I say about Age of Wonders 3? If you have loved the original Age of Wonders, but initially rejected AoW2, then AoW3 might not be something for you. But if you love AoW2:SM, then AoW3 with its DLC will be a thing you might love too. Best things first: The music.If you love the original AoW soundtrack, and even if the AoW2:SM ost is just ""nyah"", you will fall in love with AoW3 soundtrack. Michiel van den Bos did an excellent job on this. Be it the member berries out of the remake of ""Love & Death"", the thrilling beat from ""Looming Conflict"" or just the haunting music from ""Amassing Forces"" that even haunts you at your daydreams, if you loved the AoW soundtrack, then you don't wanna miss out the AoW3 soundtrack! There are things in this game however that changes gameplay a lot. Now you can stack 6 instead of 8 units on a field, your realm ""expands"" like in a civilization game, differently than the wizard's tower in AoW2, and most of your units appear as troups instead of single warriors. Additionally you have class based buildings and buildingy may cost mana too. You cannot cast enchantments on selected units anymore, but healing abilities and alike do work effectively without further instruction. Yes, you can heal your troops by simly make a healer join the army. Same goes with mechanics and machines etc. And, what I appreciated a lot, I can build relations towards independed cities. Basically this game offers changes which may at first pose as a turn-off the same way as AoW2 did. But after adapting it, you may find it enjoyable. AoW2:SM did great effort in improving the gameplay by further elaborating the changes in gameplay. The same thing I see in AoW3 Golden Realms and Eternal Lords, with in both improve the gameplay by further elaborating the changes in gameplay. I don't care much about the halflings, but boy, the introduction of the Necromancer was about right! In every game I was kindly weirded that there were human undeads, but never did I see an orc undeads or an elf undeads. Finally, undead aren't a race themselves but may consist of several races. Additionally you can manage your relationship with the races. I have viewed AoW as a race of races, instead AoW2 as a race of wizards. I think AoW3 is in proper balance of both. What I do miss now is weirdly a game mechanic half-way done in AoW2, namely the construction of shrines devoted to certain spirits that you can build your own relationship on. And I greatly miss the shadow realm, one of the best things implemented in AoW2:SM!			"

												No manual and no tutorial, you literally have to pause the game and search for randomly uploaded videos on the internet just to figure out basic tasks, the first ""intro"" scenario tells you to do things like ""merge with army"" but then there is nothing in the in-game help topics that tell you how to do that.  WORST DOCUMENTED GAME OF ALL TIME...... HOWEVER.... it's a great game once you put the time in to learn it. I've easily spent more time playing that any game since Civilization III. Highly recomment if you enjoy strategic battles.			"

												This new iteration to the Age of Wonders franchise combines the empire management of the Civilization games and the turn based, hexagonal combat system of the Heroes of Might and Magic series perfectly. The world full of vast biomes and areas to explore has a lot to offer. From sending your armies into a crypt to find a dragon defended by dragonkin and skeletons to sending your army against the Elvish Arch Druid army, only for him to call upon the Forest God to decimate your musketeers. This game offers amazing customization options as well, from creating your character and his looks to choosing his race, his class, his attributes and his spells. All of these options affect how you will play the game. Will you become a Dwarf Arch Druid and heal the land around your empire to reap the awards of a bountiful Harvest? Or will you become a Dragonkin Mage and call down fire and plague and destroy your rival's lands? These spells and skills also affect the combat in the game. Your heroes will have one time spells to use to decimate a particulary powerful creature or even call up a large random creature, which turns out to be a poisonous death adder. Overall, this game is a great source of fun and enjoyment and I can see myself putting many more hours into this game.			"

												so far, Age of Wonders 3 is proving to be almost identical to Age of Wonders 2 in it's general feel, but with just a couple of adjustments that make it even better.Sadly, the worst part of the game is the manual/in-game explanations of mechanics.  They're terrible.  I'm still trying to figure out what ""constraint"" is and how/if it can be altered, there are icons that pop up on the map at various junctions that I haven't been able to find any explanation for, and there are compounded features on terrain that complicate other abilities to affect terrain...in short, I love the game tactically - I *hate* the ridiculously poor ""manual"" - as in, there IS no manual, and I'm just using what I know from previous age of wonders games, inferring from basic tactical-game tropes, and piecing together other things based on context.  This, by the way, is NOT how one should approach an empire tactical game - I feel like I should not have to be ""guessing"" at how to get this done, or what this term means...but, besides that, I'm loving it so far, although I'll admit to only having played a couple of hours - so, this is an initial impressions review, not an overall game review...not yet.

												Age of Wonders III is a very combat centered turn based strategy game with a fantasy setting where magic can turn the tide of battle just as much as steel. Many people try to compare this game to Civilization V, in respect to that I respond. Age of Wonders III does use a city based system in part to produce an army and procure territory to gain resources. However, in the defense of that mechanic there are options of using Summoned units, Inns, and rewards gained from battle or clearing quests to earn an army. Some of those features are clearly not in Civilization V. For me the better game series to compare to comes from the Real Time Strategy games known as Warcraft (Age of Wonders III) and Starcraft (as opposed to Civ V). If you ever played Warcraft III you might remember the times of having a Hero unit that could (and often did) become more powerful than most other units of your army, sometimes more powerful than a small handful of units on their own.Age of Wonders III uses a Hero system in a similar concept as Turn Based Strategy game. Your heroes level up, earn abilities. You can quest, battle, or even forge your own gear (non-campaign on the forging bits) for your heroes to use in combat. Heroes can die, and when they die they drop all the items they had on them. But you do not have to say goodbye to them forever because there are ways in game to revive them, powerful revival magic (instead of hero shrines from Warcraft 3).TLDR: Ultimately, if you play the game for a single player experience you will find enjoyment in the campaigns, and for a time in the solo scenarios, random maps, and various play styles. However, combat will quickly become tedious and repetative. Against the A.I. I recommend using Auto-Battle most the time, but the true glory of the Manual Battles is when you can fight against a Human Opponent using either Online, LAN, or Hotseat as a multi-player turn based game.Quick Notes:- I recommend Turn Based with a 3 minute turn timer for small groups.(turn timer incase people forget to hit end turn)- There is the option to use Simultaneous turns (but it can feel choppy, and it can lead to logisitic problems for battle prep on the strategic map)			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is a turn-based fantasy 4X strategy game focused on combat rather than empire building. As such, it has more in common with Master of Magic and Heroes of Might and Magic III than with Civilizations 5.The base game provides two different and quite long campaigns featuring branching paths and different endings, a few pre-generated scenarios, and a random map generator with a lot of map and game options to customize your games to your liking.Multiplayer is present and alive with the possibility to play with people who own the GOG version, meaning the community is not divided.You start a game by customizing your leader by choosing his race and class between 6 different races and 6 different races, amounting to 36 different initial combinations, with each race and class having distinct spells and characteristic, providing them different optimal gameplay while still being homogeneous enough to keep things balanced. To further specialize your leader, you can also chose between 8 specialization options, such as Water adept, Fire adept, Explorer, etc.The game is extremely fun to play and the combat system is excellent in both concept and execution. Add to that different units and spells interacting together dynamics and you get really epic battles that never feel like they are dragging on.Golden Realms Expansion:The first expansion pack adds one new race, two new specializations, a new campaign, new scenarios, new units, new spells, new mechanics, and new map options, turning the game from great to amazing.Highly recommended!!!

												For strategy game maniacs such as myself I can recommend this at full price. However, if you are new to the gendre I would rather wait till discount or buy some other strategy game first. It should be noted though that I've only played multiplayer so my recommendation is solely based on that.If roughly compared to other 4x strategy games I've played I would say it's better than Endless Legend but worse than Civilization V, and quite par on par with Endless Space. This is of course my personal opinion, and coming from someone who rarely touches single player aspect of strategy games and plays almost solely against friends in multiplayer.The little experience I've had with AI is that it's somewhat repeative, stupid and predictable. For example if AI is defending a city it tends to charge trough the gates giving attacking player easy win. But this is very common for games (that's why I play almost solely against human opponents) and Age of Wonders still does better job with AI than for example Civilization V.			"

												This game is very entertaining. The way the combat works, is an interesting twist to typical HOMM style.  There are not any creature stacks and units due full damage regardless of health until they die.  Along with that, probably the best feature is being able to pull multiple armies (attacker and defender to a combined total of 6) into a single battle.  If you are looking for a combat focused turn based strategy, do not overlook this.Pros:Small to large scale battles.Lots of Hero customization (talents and itemcrafting).Game looks good.Haven't had any crashes or bugs.Campaign story is enganging.The voice acting is very good.Cons.The AI is brutally difficulty even on normal.The tutorial doesn't tell you much.Could take too long for multiplayer (I've had some battles take an hour plus).Not much of a diplomacy system (fine by me but others may be sad).Every time I go to load I get asked if I want to save (why?).Third party drm (can do single player without logging in though).

												When i heard this was like HoMM and Civ5 i was pretty much sold, i love these games but its more like HoMM in almost every sense, the base building is a side thought and combat is the focus. The loot whoring i did as a dwarf warlord got a bit intense the first time i played and i admit i love that aspect of this and HoMM.  The battles in this get ridiculos when you attack one group with 3-4 of your own, its  the greatest feeling when you see a band of rogues running around the outside of your town and you go complete overkill bringing in multiple buffed up heros with all ranked up units to pick on the nerds with there light crossbows. Also you can have one unit beat numerous foes with spells from your hero who is nowhere near. i have never had the same thing happen twice yet and i love it, does get a bit boring when your trying to preserve your champion 5+ units and take over the world cause some reason they like to die for no reason in auto resolve... all in all 8/10 cause it needs some more content to it.

I am finding it very hard to find fault with this game, and with future expansions will only get even better.Definately has that 'One.. More.. Turn...' factor.			"

												Great game which brings back much of what I loved from AoW 1 and 2. However, perhaps my main misgivings are just nastalgia but I find empathizing with the leaders rather meh. Early Release there were a lot of balance issues. Yet I recently got back into this game and I find it even more fun and invigorating than before. My wife has filed for a restraining order against my computer.... Looking for a gaming shack greater than 100m from my current address :) I do still find a lack of depth in regard to the spell book. While I admist some spells are OP/Amazing and all classes have equiv of this OP spell.... they arent completely balanced. For example You have spell that are individual cast on tiles to convert to forest, etc.... yet there is one spell just as in previous versions of the game that you cast and tiles will automatically expand from your domain to this unnamed type of tile. Previous versions all had this outbound growing spell of tile your race will love. Morale in this game is very well handled, even with the new DLC and the necro. I just find the customization options of GAMEPLAY, i.e. spells, quests rather lacking. Great to design your own leaders but meh..... 8/10Will continue to play in the future			"

												The game is in general well developed.It's not a clone of any other game, it's got its own long history and deserves its place in the genre of 4X games.While there might be some performance issues and some little flaws here and there, the issues are easily solved by turning off anti-aliasing (which is not really important in a 4X game) and the flaws are already being fixed.The developer is currently actively patching the game and already fixed a lot of issues and added a couple features.The AI might not be able to trick the player but it works well and there are a lot of options to interact with the player.The graphics look good, the controls are pretty good.Since it is a turn based game that consumes a lot of CPU performance you should know that there are two types of turn systems.One is where all can move at the same time. This reduces your waiting time but while the AI moves you have to wait till your clicks are registered.The other is where each player has their own turn. That increases your waiting time, but while its your turn, you can click around without delays.The story catches up on the events of the previous titles and sounds interesting, we might see an add-on for this game.While the story campaign falls a little short, the random map generator, world editor, scenario mode and multiplayer mode allow you to experience new maps and new opponents every time you play.I believe AoW3 is a well made sequel.

												So you like 4x games? You like the exploring, expanding, exterminating, and exploiting? You also like turn based games? Well then you have come to the right game. This game revolves around empire building and toppling enemy empires. Pretty straight forward, but each game can take up to four hours to complete. The bigger the map the longer. Me and my friend did a very large map(largest you can get) in a two vs two. We won, but it took us at least 20+ hours to finish it. You found a city, build an army explore some dungeon areas to get some gear for heroes. Build bigger armies and vanquish your opponents. I would recommend getting the DLC even though it is pricey. It makes it more fun to spice up the game with more classes and races to play as. "

												I have played many games of this genre and of all those games, this has to be one of my favorite all time.  The city planning is on par.  If you liked Civ, this is Civ +.  If you like endless legends, you might appreciate the added control in fights.  The reason I feel like the fighting system is amazing is because of the amount of control and strategy involved in the decisions you make.  The hero's are a great feature, although I will admit endless legend does have more customization for your hero with the gear and items you can make.  Great to play on your own or with friends... love this game.			"

												This was my first Age of Wonders game. I've played tons of HoMM up to 3, but no Civ or any other 4x games. Overall I like the game and recommend it. It took me five restarts of the first campaign before I ""got"" it, so you might need to be patient.The story is indepth, if you enjoy that (admittedly I started skipping it a few missions in - just wanted to play). The graphics are great. So far I've made it through most of the Elven campaign. You get to play several different heroes. Each one has many different skills to choose. You'll find loot along the way that you equip on your heroes. There are several different quests for each map, some optional.There's lots of exploring, including underground. Lots of fighting as well. The battles are hex based, similar to tabletop games. One thing you'll learn is you'll want at least two armies when attacking. The battles are strategic - obstacles that cause line of sight penalties, flanking, hero spells, siege attacks if someone is in a city, support-group spells and abilites, etc.On the postive, I enjoy exploring the map and battling, although I auto battle a lot because it's quicker. The graphics are nice. I like the loot you pick up. As someone who's never played an AoW game before, I do find the AI challenging, even on Easy. If the AI has an advantage, it will attack your army. Any time you leave a city undefended, the AI will take it. And it seems very smart in the battles; it doesn't make dumb moves.For the negatives, I find the game repetitive. I build up my cities pretty much identical each map. So far all of the maps have just been ""Defeat the other players."" Manual battles can be lengthy which makes it tough if you have limited playing time. There is such an advantage to being in a city for a fight that you can trap the AI in a city as you buildup other armies to attack. I've run into this repeatedly - having to track down ""turtled"" enemy heroes in cities and build up large enough armies to win.There are some negatives for me, but I do still enjoy playing the game. I'm almost finished with the Elven campaign and hoping the other campaign offers more than just ""Defeat all enemies"" every map.			"

												Dis vereh fun gam.  Do lik.  Lik olde on. Vereh guud.I do like how different this game is from AoW2:SM, making heroes and leader practically the same power value (except heroes die permanently, unless if you have a resurrection spell) and units specific to your leader's class are a cool addition.  Graphics are good, even on pretty low.  The direction they took combat was interesting, too; they made it a lot like a tabletop wargame (reminds me of Warhammer (fantasy), except with hexes).			"

												I am totally hooked on Age of Wonders III. The combat is definitely the central aspect of this game, and they have done an awesome job making it engaging, and varied. There are tons of different units, each with different stats and abilities depending on which race they are, and the ""heroes"" can be equipped with weapons, shields, armours, and mounts that you find when exploring the map's dungeons.The fantasy theme of this game is done extremely well, and I would say this is one of the only strategy games of this kind I truly enjoy and would recommend to anyone.

												 Having been a fan of the original two Age of Wonders titles, I picked this up. I held no real expectations, as most modern reboots of older franchises subscribe to conformed design and retain less than a desireable amount of their core originality. Oftentimes it actually alienates the core of the original fangroups. Angering at minimum a considerable amount of fans. Now... I could go on a long and verbose tangent comparing this to its predecessors, but I figure creating a category for that is better(Concept Preservation). I just hope my thoughts are enough to provide you some insight before you do or do not purchase this.Score Summary: I will start with this so you can circle back to it, and review my overall scores without distancing yourself from each scoring.Additionally, I have not tried the internet mutiplayer. I would recommend finding an opinion on that if you're looking to play competitively or with others over the internet. I typically play this hotseat style.Gameplay: 6 / 10Graphics: 8 / 10Functionality: 7 / 10Concept Presrvation: 6 / 10Overall Score: 6.75 / 10---------------------------Gameplay: 6/10Reasons for docked points.-No extended game scaling: Mechanically this could be corrected by added research point spell costs, or specialization research; Which I assume, could actually be patched in. This pretty much makes any large map a real brain drill to endure.-Limitations on customizations feel too constraining. In the end, you're playing with modules for heroes over depth and flavor. Same problem applies to craftable in game items. Raising the ceiling on  item customization and increasing customization options could radically improve this.-Really jarring moments in gameplay when moving units in combat and when trying to use commands with simultanous turns mode. Simultanous turns saves time, but often any ai or indepents will move before any player because the engine does not process multiple commands from multiple players in real time. It takes the first command entered.-Limited usefulness to mechanics of the game. Veterancy chief among them. For all the work of raising a unit naturally to high veterancy and the difficulty of preserving them in battle, the payoff doesn't even feel like it's there. It does influence things, but so marginally that there really isn't a great deal of value to even having it. The only payoffs that truly reward are those with abilities attached to them or evolutions(Don't ever expect to get those easily.) The tier system is good for informative purposes, but as a function of the game, it murders the potential fo the veterancy system. I would've recommended a alternative approach veterancy such as a higher level cap for lower tiers, because it makes sense that weaker units would develop more skills than stronger ones over time; and it would richly reward people for the effort of keeping them alive. Perhaps such a change could be patched in or added with some kind of DLC expansion.Gameplay Review Why a six out of ten? Let's begin with the things I like about the game. Fundamentally, what sets this game franchise apart from others to me, is the ability to radically change the environment; This incarnation of the game doesn't just make it visual, it can have a serious impact on the strength of armies if the environment is hostile to them. Morale is a very real thing to this game, and strong positive and negative effects radically alter the behavior of the cities, armies, and heroes that you manage. Affecting or controlling everything from critical hits, to random city behaviors, desertions, and rebellions. (Positive causes surprise good presents(Sudden construction, resource bursts), negative usually means rebellious armies start spawning in the domain.) The diplomacy engine has been expanded upon slightly with npcs, with an added alignment system and other behavioral systems to ais. I found that the stronger I got, the less inclined to start a war other ai players would be. A combination of wealth, alignment, military threat, and probably a few other factors I haven't discovered largely control how neutral camps and ai players percieve and interact with you. Players can trade items, cities, forts, the right to enter borders. (If someone declares war on you, they ignore your borders presence when it comes to whether or not they can enter your area..)You can create a somewhat customizeable leader with some variances on appearance, skill setup; The lack of options and the hard cap of only 3 specializations hurt the long game. This game really feels like it thrives during a mid game situation. Early battles can be quite difficult if you don't know what you're doing, and I found myself frequently using auto combat, because of the risk it would be to try to run things myself. I'm certain that if I better knew what I was doing, life would be a little better. Late game can get a little empty, as oftentimes... When you hit end-game research, your research points feel kinda wasted, Units are divided into seperate tiers, from Tier I. to Tier IV. Despite the option of veterancy, Higher tiers almost ALWAYS win over lower tiers. If you play this game... Pay VERY close attention to your tier setups, and ability setups. You can recruit heroes whom, like your leader, can get stronger as the game progresses. Typically, a naked starting hero has a lot of trouble taking down Tier II-III units. But by the time you finish developing them into whatever you intend to make em do, presuming you did a fair to good job, your heroes will trash Tier IV units. And regardless of whether or not they are in battles, they passively pick up experience as the game progresses.Combat feels kinda sluggish and jarring, but that is probably because of my personal history and the expectations other franchises have imparted upon me. It was my experience that most minor battles are better spent autoing, and sometimes it's enjoyable to watch the replay of the battle. (Especially since you can accelerate the animation speeds. Which I find myself most comfortable at x2 speed.) There is a certain excitement factor to auto combating a closely matched engagement because of the huge gamble it represents, those also usually make the most interesting combat replays to check out.I think that covers all the major thoughts I had on gameplay, Let's move on.==================Graphics: 8 / 10Reasons for point docking.-Graphics errors that have occured.-Some visual bug based crashes.This section is largely subjective, but I think that the game delivers exactly what it tries to in graphics for the most part. I had some visual glitches here and there, most prominant of which, was a persistant rapid graphic flicker. Creating effects that weren't there, blacking out things that were supposed to be there. Usually these resolved with a game restart. It has only happened a handful of times, and could very easily be an isolated bug to my computer, I cannot be sure.==================Functionality: 7 / 10Reasons for point docking.-Visual Bug Crashes-Lategame/Veterancy Issues.-Simultanous Turn mode is less than satisfactory.I applaud the inclusing of the game manual as a button inside the game that opens an in-game manual to reference and its great detail.Simultanous turns is an awful idea when your engine will only take one global command execution at a time. All players should be able to act simultanously and not on a first come first serve basis. I presume the big hang up here is battles, but it should've been simple to think of creating a holding pattern for battles.The concept preservation score is a reflection of how I felt the dev team did on delivering us a true sequal; Scored based on keeping/improving concepts of the orginals. I will elaborate further in comments, if I can. I am at the limit sadly. I would be glad to answer questions via messages.			"

												Having played most fantasy turn based strategy games since Master of Magic, I can honestly say that Age of Wonders III is a worthy addition to the genre.  It looks and sounds great, runs smoothly, and (unlike most of the venerable fantasy TBS,) has an AI that actually shows up and tries to win.  However, if you go into the game with the same attitude that you might have in the older games, you might not have much fun.Age of Wonders III is about conquest and fighting.  Everything you do in this game must drive you to this goal.  You cannot explore the map lazily looking for secrets, build armies of ""fluff"" because dwarf axemen are cool, or waste your mana terriforming cities when the enemy is at the gates.  In this game you have to constantly be on the lookout for ways to exploit the map, and for enemies to come out of nowhere.  By the end of the game, the surviving empires may be two giant war machines endlessly pumping units at each other from across the map (thankfully, rally points have been added.)  The last battles will, in drawn out cases, consist entirely of massive stacks of the most powerful units.  This may or may not be okay with people.I'll admit, I'm the kind of person who wants his last army to look like something from Lord of the Rings, just a huge mass of swords and bows being thrown at a huge mass of orcs.  Sadly, that will rarely happen, as this huge mass of men would just be slaughtered by a smaller mass of dragons, giants, war machines or those horrible Manticore Riders.  Indeed, I was a bit frustrated when my army of dwarven crossbowmen behind a stone wall was slaughtered by a handful of these units.  I guess what I'm trying to say with this is that this game will not make you feel like you are really leading an army of fantasy creatures in a great war.  Neither does a game of Magic the Gathering, but it sure is fun.On the subject of the AI, if you leave it alone, then you will see it turning into a massive war machine with the aforementioned rallypoints and Tier 4 units slogging across the map.  AI Knight has learned a few things since Age of Wonders II.  While it is still possible to see some tactical blunders (suiciding flyers for example) it puts up a better fight than most without extra help.  Admittedly, I haven't seen if it gets any, but I haven't noticed anything from it that made me call foul.If I have to criticize it, it would be that most games play pretty much the same, requiring a similar strategy from the player to win based on race and class choice, and the layout of the map, while it may throw occaisional curveballs at you, has little to do with how things progress.  But in that criticism I just described many games that are perfectly fine, as is this one (Heroes of Might and Magic series might be the exception there, but look how good the last one of those was...)  The fun in a game like that is to optimize that strategy to perfect it, while someone across the battlefield from you tries to counter it.  The game's AI does not forgive you if you screw up. Really if I wanted to throw out things I'd like, it'd be some degree of city specialization (choose between buildings rather than just build everything everywhere,) more options for creating items and creating/leveling characters, and maybe some map structures that can change the course of the game (special unit recruitment, buffs to city created units such as Master of Magics ""Adamantium Deposits"") and so on.  Also, with all the terriforming and terrain changing options, I want terrain to mean more to me during the game.  Maybe I'm just not paying attention to it, but right now, I only terriform for a little extra gold from cities and for looks.  Its still cool though, changin the world into a frozen wasteland or a sweltering jungle.  I do miss the Shadow World though, and the Dark Elves, and the Nomads, hell, even the Halflings, but I am sure I'll see them all again.There will be DLC, and I will pay for it.  The game world can only get bigger and better, and Triumph really seems to be putting all their effort into it.tldr: Its very fun.  And competitive.  Its not building an epic empire in a grand story, its all about stomping your enemies into the dirt.  And it ends like Clash of the Titans except with more Titans.  Its not Age of Wonders II, but Age of Wonders II didn't magically disappear or anything.  And you can make a Dwarf Succubus.  Seriously.			"

While it is still possible to see some tactical blunders (suiciding flyers for example) it puts up a better fight than most without extra help.  Admittedly, I haven't seen if it gets any, but I haven't noticed anything from it that made me call foul.If I have to criticize it, it would be that most games play pretty much the same, requiring a similar strategy from the player to win based on race and class choice, and the layout of the map, while it may throw occaisional curveballs at you, has little to do with how things progress.  But in that criticism I just described many games that are perfectly fine, as is this one (Heroes of Might and Magic series might be the exception there, but look how good the last one of those was...)  The fun in a game like that is to optimize that strategy to perfect it, while someone across the battlefield from you tries to counter it.  The game's AI does not forgive you if you screw up. Really if I wanted to throw out things I'd like, it'd be some degree of city specialization (choose between buildings rather than just build everything everywhere,) more options for creating items and creating/leveling characters, and maybe some map structures that can change the course of the game (special unit recruitment, buffs to city created units such as Master of Magics ""Adamantium Deposits"") and so on.  Also, with all the terriforming and terrain changing options, I want terrain to mean more to me during the game.  Maybe I'm just not paying attention to it, but right now, I only terriform for a little extra gold from cities and for looks.  Its still cool though, changin the world into a frozen wasteland or a sweltering jungle.  I do miss the Shadow World though, and the Dark Elves, and the Nomads, hell, even the Halflings, but I am sure I'll see them all again.There will be DLC, and I will pay for it.  The game world can only get bigger and better, and Triumph really seems to be putting all their effort into it.tldr: Its very fun.  And competitive.  Its not building an epic empire in a grand story, its all about stomping your enemies into the dirt.  And it ends like Clash of the Titans except with more Titans.  Its not Age of Wonders II, but Age of Wonders II didn't magically disappear or anything.  And you can make a Dwarf Succubus.  Seriously.			"

												Review as of the Eighth of May, 2014.After about 60-70 hours in total with recorded time and offline time in this four X game, I have to commend it.As with every 4X game, this one has a distinct love of two of them, eXploit and eXterminate. Let's start with that.The command, unlike some other games, namely Fallen Enchantress, which is the main comparrison I'll be making, is rather dull. It takes about 25-70 turns, depending on what's in its domain, to complete the city entirely, and each city has to make that trek and the only real thing that changes it is the Raze, Plunder and Migrate options for each city, which is a nice touch, since each race has its own benefits.  Compared to Fallen Enchantress, though, the cities feel... Dull. It's the same path each time, and once you get all your class specific units, the entire war units tree is useless. One main problem I have with it, and this is a personal quipe, but oh well, is that the cities just suddenly... get taken over. Anything above a city I'm practically yelling at the screen with the general rage when a group of SCOUT units, which literally are so easy to kill that a tier four takes 1 damage to them, takes over your throne city/any other metropolis. That was a major turn off for me.Now, onto the war section. The combat is probably the most fun I've had in a 4X. It's really slick, it carries weight, and the seiges are fun. The general feel of the units are amazing, with specific combinations practically winning seiges and battles. The units all have unique rolls on the battlefield, some are tanks that don't deal much damage, or a ""Give them the plague!"" units that makes whatever they attack weaker. And one of my favorite, and at the same time least favorite, mechanics is that each battlefield consists of six hexes that each unit on takes part in. But then comes the little problem of top teir units being stacked and being literally impossible in a city to dislodge. And the units that aren't inside the gates on the map spawning on the battlefield suddenly inside it. That irritated me that you couldn't just send an army to fight one another. But, despite the units unique to each faction, I kept feeling the same feeling of ""These are rather generic units"" at the end of the game, since every end game unit tends to be what you'd expect. They should flesh it out a lot more and add either entire unit customization or just athestic customization. Oh. And heroes are practically useless unless you totally defend them with everything, since they're so low health and defence.The explore and expand elements are generally how it feels in other games, use the explore to get loot and make more of the same generic city over the map. And don't even get me started on how useless the neautral city AI are. They're there for one purpose: Be conquered!All in all, though, I'd say it's an amazing game with its problems that can be fixed with just a smidge of effort, or if a modder is willing, they could always fix it.Overall opinion: For me, personally, I like more diplomancy and less masses of war units everywhere. 8/10. I recommend it, I got my money's worth out of it.			"

												I give this game a 8 out of 10.The game reminds you strongly of Heroes of Might and Magic.  Your character travels the map, explores locations, and takes controll of resource points.  Combat isn't as developed as HoMM.  Your troops are deployed randomly and your find yourself really missing being able to line up your troops as you see fit.  Also lacks the variety of HoMM's tactical combat options for your units.The game also strongly reminds you of Elemental Fallen enchantress.  You can send out units to colonize and expand your realm.  Building different buildings expands the zone of controll for each city.  It falls a little short of the Elemental comparison with the lack of RPG elements and the variety of items to equip your character with.The storyline for the two campaigns is decent, the single female voice actress does a great job, but you find yourself wishing for a few animated cutscenes to spice things up.  Each mission is more or less the same.  Build up your troops and take out your enemies.  It can get a little stale after about 20 hours though.			"

You have to remake every race in every class and that hurts the game a bit in comparisson to other games in the series. Hoewever a must have for the fans of 4x gaming and the old skool fans of aow.

												A fantastic outgrowth of the very strong Age of Wonders series of games. If you like Civilization, but would rather be throwing lightning bolts instead of tac nukes, this is the game for you. The strategic elements are designed to offer a lot of player license in success or failure, and there are multiple avenues of growth and focus to fit a player's play-style.The Class system is very fun, allowing players to command an Empire with a very different flavor depending on his or her class.The first expansion was just announced, which ushers in the Halflings to the game, and I'm looking forward to more content that may introduce more and more of the missing (and classic) races from previous games. Well done, Triumph!			"

												I never played the original, but I loved Age of Wonders II. So coming into this as a fan of AoW2, my expectations were high, and I honestly wasn't disappointed. I love this game for so many reasons, from leader creation and customization to the way your race tints the special units your class affords you. The game is visually beautiful and fairly well-paced, and the random map generator has always delivered a world I genuinely enjoyed exploring and conquering.AoW3 suits a number of play styles and victory conditions, all of which you can toggle on or off. The battles require thought and planning a little more than raw power. A number of weak units can take down a smaller number of more powerful units if you position everyone correctly and use just the right spells at the right times. I get a genuine sense of pride every time I successfully bring down a powerful enemy army.There are, of course, a few things that could stand to be improved. I'd like more customization options as far as hair is concerned, and there are some lighting issues and minor clipping problems on some of the unit models. However, all of these issues are superficial and very easy to overlook. I don't find they detract from my experience at all.Excellent game if you enjoy fantasy, strategy or 4X games, and an absolutely superb game if you enjoy all three!			"

												I am a great fan of the whole series of Age of Wonder so when I discovered it for linux I didn't hesitate to buy it.The game is the worthy descendant of the dynasty and I found in it what I was expecting.Other people wrote better and more complete reviews so I will point out the only two things I didn't like:1. Only watchtowers can be razed. It's a pity because razing opponent structures was an important strategy element.2. The campaigns (at least the two I finished) are a bit short: their scenarios take a lot of time to complete but there are few of them. I would have preferred more and shorter (not easier!) scenarios.However these are just two details that I didn't like: overall the game is wonderful, so thumb up without hesitation!			"

												Great game with many of the features from the much loved AOW 2 and AOW Shadow Magic I enjoyed so much! This game is certainly worth picking up! My only draw back is some of the units seem badly mismatched for their races. (I mean Dwarven Succubus? Really... Gross....) Overall a great game staying true (aside from those weird mismatch units) to the other games!			"

												At a younger age I played ""Master of Magic"" by Microprose. Loved that game and spent countless hours playing it. When Age of Wonders came along, I had a ton of fun with that as well. Shadow magic and Age of Wonders two were also a lot of fun. This one however, I didn't really like. They've taken a step away from the high fantasy setting and tried to incorporate steam punk into the game, which in turn makes it a mish mash of two different settings. They should have gone with the original concept or simply made a steam punk game and call it something else. The previous games did have some hints of steam punk with the dwarven faction, but this time around it's all over the place and magic feels like a secondary thought in a game that's supposedly about magic.The story isn't really that good, just a repetition of previous installments, but not performed as well and kind of boring.The game is to it's core the same as previous games, but the i.e. lack of diversity between the races is gone, now instead it is based on ""classes"" what type of units you get. It's not a bad game but I was expecting more of a third installment. Magic doesn't feel as useful as previous games, other than perhaps some very late game summons that pretty much instant win the game for you. There's a ton of loot for your heroes, which is quite nice (but feels over the top at times, i.e. there is a spell where you can summon eggs that turn into mounts and I just spammed that spell until I got the best mounts in the game for all my heroes) and heroes are still very useful addition to your armies. I liked the introduction of mounts for heroes, that affected how they move both in the world and tactical map (even gives some stats). The music is as always good, could have used a few more tracks though. While it might seem like I am bashing the game, I'm not, it simply wasn't what I expected it to be. If you enjoyed the previous AoW games you should give it a try, I played through both sides on the original AoW III, but didn't feel like it was worth my time playing the expantions/dlc, I'd rather just give the original games another go.

												It's a fun tactical strategy game with some rpg elements. There is a decent number of unique units and spells which make each class feel unique. There are many items to find, which—along with the randomized maps—increases the replayability by quite a bit. There are other games like this, but this one is well polished and well updated.			"

												Oh yes!Age of Wonders remastered, with slight mechanics changes to make it more balanced (like hero progression and spells) then unbalanced back into different classes' matchmaking. Even if it doesn't seem like it at first glance but it has bigger depth then the predecessors, just wating to be slowly discovered constantly keeping it fresh and new.If you're into this kind of game this is the very apogee and you will play it for MANY years to come. Can't see how things can get better that this.Devs are really good and reactive, they treat matters like 4k resolutions and 5 different operating systems compatibilities, powerful modding tools have been added in only three months.Also strong community supportthis is what Steam sais on the Community Page : ""Most popular community and official content for the past week.""

												This game is a perfect example of how 4X games should be. Makes Civ5 look like a boring chess game, If you love Civ 5 I would recommend this one! It has waaaaaay better combat, the fantasy setting makes everything looks sooo well done, soundtrack is awesome and gameplay is like Civ5 but less boring an repetitive (you can explore caves, dungeons, castles, sea forts,... etc.)If you like turn-based games you will love this one! it is more based on combat and politics than building/economy but the last two still hold a decent role.This game is not a gem, but it's an uncut diamond you find after killing 50 rebels and digging for 5 days.Rate: 8/10 (based on some minor flaws like, the fps drop when you change turns and the somtimes lazy reaction time of you mouseclicks, other than that GREAT GAME! an MUST BUY.)

												This is my favorite game right now.  It has the best of expected stratagy game features, and extends the standard by including features that were missing in other empire building games.You can not only choose your leaders, but you can customize there face, hair, clothes. You can also pick the scene background for there leader screen.  You can also decide on the pose. very sweet.  I like the feelling of entering the buildings on the map.  I really like being able to move the pieces during tacticle battles. The unit banners have the health meter, so I pick on the weakest guy.Naval battles actually take place on the water, and ""Embarked"" units are standing on boats while they fight.  The research takes place from a spell book, which is cool. The mini map is more custamizable than I was used to. The landscape textures are beautiful.Zooming out on the strategic map and having the map become a ""cloth"" map with drafted geographic features, makes this seem even more emersive.  It is very similar to the map in the end pages of ""The Hobbit"".Speaking of fantasy, the realm and genre one has come to expect from fantasy rpgs is well represented.From undead, to will-o-whisps. Mermaids and Krakens; Kobolds, and Dragons.  Treasure, gold, mana, and Hero pick ups.I had gotten fairly good at my usual stratagy war game, so I am humbled at how involved the added calculations and stats, the RPG world encompasses.  Good bad, Creation, destruction; the 4 elements; Arch Druids compared to dreadnaughts, or necromancers.So much fun! So much to ""get into""The single most excelent awsome feature is the Modding Support.Import your blender models! Download the Rigged models from the developer! Extend the Resources that are already in the game! Customize the story line.Linked maps in a custom campaign.  Program quests! Build underground worlds! The creation Engine alone is worth every pennie I spent, (My goblin leader is Pennie the Pincher)			"

												This is a game that makes me look up and look at the clock and realise that 7 hours of my life has just passed by and it is suddenly light outside and oh god I need to sleep before I have to go to work and oh alright then, just one more turn and then I will defintiely go to bed... Stylistically it is a cartoony version of games such as Heroes of Might and Magic where you control a Hero and their own faction of fantasy scamps out to do valiant battle against other assorted fantasy tropes and critters. But under the cheery colourful exterior there is a very good game that, although with limitations, scratches almost all of my fantasy strategy empire building rpg itches. The RPG style Hero levelling and item system is well executed. The empire building is decent. The battles can be pretty fun and sometimes even quite challenging. The diplomacy is about as good as any other 4X game I've played and not as awful as some of them although I have yet to try to win diplomatically and so I am not sure if that is even an option. I have not played AoW 1 or 2 so I have no idea if they are better or worse than this installment but as I said, I think this one is addictive good fun.Now I feel that there is room for improvement. The late game is a bit of a boring grind; as your cities expand they all turn out a bit samey. The AI is not terrible and I have been beaten by it a few times but I wish they would actually do a bit of empire building on its own: they never build roads or forts for example. Perhaps it is better against human players but as I have no friends I have yet to experience that aspect of the game.All in all, if you like your 4X's but feel that CIV V doesn't feature enough ogres, imps or kobold minions then you should defintiely give this title a go. Also the two first expansions are good additions that in my opinion adds a lot of essential content to the vanilla game so maybe wait for a sale to get the bundle. Just a tip.			"

												Grading Scale:10 - Masterpiece9 - Amazing8 - Great7 - Good6 - Okay5 - Mediocre4 - Bad3 - Terrible2 - Abomination1 - UnplayableGame: Age of Wonders IIISummary: Turn-based strategy game with some RPG elements and a fantasy setting.Pros:Combat- Refreshing and fun for a turn based strategy game. Although some flaws are evident (will go over it in the ""cons"" section). Combat takes place in a battlefield that takes into account the type of terrain you were on when combat was initiated. You can move your units around and place them in strategic areas around the field.Character Customization- Able to customize your hero with different hairstyles and certain cosmetic options such as armor and head pieces. RPG Elements- Able to equip your hero with items that are obtained throughout the world. You can also level your hero and have him/her learn new spells and moves. Among these units are mounts which really give your hero a unique feel.Units- Each unit is unique and inspired. Although you cannot customize your units the same way you can your hero, they each have their own unique abilities and appearance.Cons:Limited Victories: Although diplomacy is possible, the style of the game begs for a conquest win. The resources at your disposal for any other type of victories are simply not worth the effort. It's a lot of fun to just stomp through everything with your unique armies.Repetitiveness- After playing for a while. Combat can get a bit tedious to a point where you just find yourself skipping it altogether. Once that happens, the rest of the game just doesn't hold up. Combat is the fun part of this game, not so much the diplomacy.Verdict: Fun turn-based strategy game with a fun twist on combat that suffers from repetitiveness. The hero development, different class system and customization adds for a unique experience everytime you play the game.Score: 7			"

												Age of Wonders, a classic, something I played devoutly when I was a kid. The third installation in the series however, as expected, is far more difficult. Ramped up to be challenging and to compel thought, to really take the turn based 'strategy' to its word. This is a game where you don't really have your hand held, and you've got to consider what units may be your best option during certain parts of the campaigns. The story's also tasty enough to eat with a dash of olive oil and pepper.			"

												Fallen Enchantress, Eat your heart out.This 4X Fantasy game allows for a deep level of customization that captures the creativity of Fallen Enchantress while providing a more aesthetically pleasing, polished experience. Diplomatic and overworld gameplay remains similar to the Civilization series, while not quite as robust. It does make up for it with its level of creative control. Create your own civilization leader from a host of classes and racial combinations. Both your class and race affect the type of units your empire will have access to. If you play a rogue, depend on having stealth units, assassins and the like. Play a dreadnaught? Youll have rifleman and steam tanks. A warlord? How does having a legion of berserkers sound? While you cant directly modify individual units like fallen enchantress, the sheer vareity at your disposal makes that irrelavant.If youre looking for a high fantasy themed civilization style 4X game with RPG elements, look no further.

												Lives up to expectations marvelously.Solid music, solid graphics, fascinating creative content, and most importantly, actual gameplay, not just some cinematic romp.Recommended for anyone and everyone who likes to play actual games rather than just watching interactive movies, but also recommended for those who like production quality fitting of a game in 2014. Being highly visually and audio oriented, I wouldn't be playing this game if it suffered in production quality.			"

												Overall good game. But the AI seems to just cheat to win. You can easiely take on armies three times your size if you outplay/out manouver them so to counter this there seem to be AI armies running around made up of 6 Heroes. All the same level. To make it even worse you see a say level 5 enemy hero, with stats and buffs only reachable by lvl 20, like a lvl 5 arch druid with 18 armour 14 resistance and around 10 different individual buffs, ohh and a never ending mana pool, so it can just hit you with stoning 12 times in 1 fight. Yeah nice game if you have patience enough to restart every time the AI cheats			"

												This game is everything I had hoped the ""Total War"" series would evolve to (and didn't).  A strategic game with the option to do turn based tactical combat.    But not the NEED to do it that way.  Alliance wins means you don't have to wipe everyone off the map.  You have to explore to unmap areas.  Basically your 4x type of game.  I would like to seean option where you can turn off the automated fluff.  Birds, butterflies, schools of fish, etc. etc. is all very pretty, butafter awhile its just using up cpu with no effect on game play.I hope this team develops some historical era games with the same model.

												Age of Wonders III is one of those games that won't grab you instantly. But if you stick with it and learn the ropes, you'll find yourself playing for hours and telling yourself ""just one more turn"". The game isn't perfect, but it is one of the deepest 4x fantasy TBS game that I've played in recent years, with its strongest element being the combat system. Easily recommended to any TBS enthusiast out there.

It Rocks!I'm a big fan of the previous incarnations of this game, including the game they ""borrowed elements from"", ahem, before this series came out. It is a large scale game not unlike a fantasy version of Civilization. The games are also multi-player. Its a fantastic lan game. I used to play with a girlfriend - we would ally and take on the entire rest of the world. So far this version of the game plays very smoothly, has a lot of the original features that made the older games great and the tactical battles are fun.The game is complex. However that is the fun of it. Spending time learning the races and what special units they have. There is a lot to learn but it is definitely fun. Eventually you will find the combinations of abilities and fun units that combine to give you the juggernaut experience you are hoping for.I am so glad I saw this announced a few months ago and pre-ordered. It was great having it show up and I will probably put a dent in Titanfall playing this.			"

												Great Single Player game.  Works real well, and the graphics are very nice.  Multiplayer is sadly the worst I have ever played in a 4x game.  When playing with other human players you have to watch the combats of every single person.  So from the start I get to know your army, leader name, see how your tatics are and what you have for units.  The Game ends up being a turtle-fest and huge time sink.  I hope they fix this.  This game has huge potential with a good multiplayer.			"

												In this game, the main premise is a large scale rivalry between powerful mages with varying specializations and studies, who bend cities by their will toward good, evil, or whatever.Gameplay is reminiscent mostly of Heroes of Might and Magic, in a good way.  This is a 4X game with an especially strong emphasis on exploration and extermination, with heroes who go questing, conquering, leveling up, and looting for themselves and their empire.  Campaign actions are made on a high-level campaign map.  Battles play out on a lower-level map in a tactical turn-based manner, taking into account the terrain and structures of the tile on the campaign map.  Both maps use hexagonal tiles.  Armies (unit stacks) are composed of up to six units.  In a battle, all adjacent armies participate.  In some ways, this approach to combat feels like a middle ground between Civilization and Total War.Much of the design is reminiscent of Master of Magic.  Cities and units vary according to the class of the player and the race of the inhabitants.  There are six classes (arch druid, dreadnought, rogue, sorceror, theocrat, and warlord) and six races (high elf, human, orc, goblin, dwarf, and draconian).  The variety is good but not dizzying, with a solid array of standard unit types and a handful of specialists available in any city that has the requisite buildings.  Spellcasting plays a major role on the campaign map and in battles.  The spells span a wide spectrum from an assortment that is modest in cost and effect to the immensely powerful and expensive high tier.  Each school of magic (among air, earth, fire, water, creation, and destruction) is distinct, with its own characteristic effects and strategies.  The interplay between questing, empire building, warfare, and spellcasting is fun, engaging, and balanced.Compared to other 4X games, there is a diminished emphasis on exploitation.  Rather, the exploitation here is ultimately focused on serving the exploration and extermination.  You won't find options for cultural, diplomatic, or economic victories here, and the gameplay options are limited likewise.  This is not a game of peace.  [edit: Interestingly, Triumph has hinted that this is an area that they will expand in upcoming updates.]The overall fit and finish is very good, although not without room for improvement.  The UI is strongly reminiscent of Civilization V—a good choice of inspiration.  Some aspects live up to this standard better than others.  There is a Tome of Wonders (akin to Civilopedia), but it's a pain to navigate (no back button?!  among other problems), and some of its pages neglect important information.  Some stats show breakdowns on hover, as they should, but some breakdowns lack desirable detail, while others are simply omitted.  I'm curious to see if any of this improves with ongoing updates.Unlike Civilization and most other games in the 4X genre, a game of Age of Wonders III at normal pace is significantly shorter.  Expect a commitment of three to six afternoons instead of three to six full days.  Considering the pesky existence of real life, this is a very desirable trait.If you like 4X and high fantasy, and you'd like a game that combines the two in a form that's easy to swallow, then this is a great choice.

												Just Another Review.Well so I bought this game because everyone who has played a kings bounty, disciples, heroes of might and magic?, civ and etc type of turn based strategy game will get the itch to play another if they discover they like it.Ive put around 20-30 hours into this game single player only (commonwealth) and I was pleasently suprised. After I wrapped around the controls which for whatever reason seemed backwards (left and right mouse buttons would be vise versa if i made things lol), I got pretty into the game and keep coming back. Although I could say a lot more, I am going to summarize things in bullet form as best i can and I will likely miss some things:Thinks I think that could be improved:-The research tree is still rather baffling if you want to plan ahead or unlock certain things unless you have played a lot. If it was set up like in civilization with some kind of flow chart it would be a lot easier to prioritize.-Combat animations are kinda crumby with the units (i'm just whining nothing that harms the game)-The hero cannot die clause. Warcraft 2 all over again. In the campaign you basically just keep your hero in the back away from harm and cast spells unless you want him focus'ed by the AI and to reload your save. Personally I think the hero's need more durability else they essentially just play a support role for most of the fight, cuz when they die everything stops. You aren't going to siege a city without those wonderful buffs they give all the units in the army pack nor will you go and explore ruins/want to fight if a hero isn't milking exp.-The exp system, it should essentially award everyone in the army attacking or not. Win a battle: gain most exp, lose a battle: hero gets some exp everyone else is dead lol, Run from a battle get no exp (since running could be abused). I essentially just have hero use a ranged ability to kill off whatever i can (safely) as to net more exp.-The AI during sieges, if you have 2 trebuchets you can basically funnel all the enemies through a narrow hole in the wall, ive beat a few ""very likely defeat"" situations abusing this with a very small army. If the enemy is more numerous then you past a certain extent they should just bum rush you out the gates and cut u off instead of hole up and get picked off.-Spellcasting seems kind of wonky, losing your hero for casting oil skin almost doesnt seem worth it... some spells should perhaps count as your cast and not your hero turn and the more powerful will take both... Things I dont understand yet....:-I still have no idea the use of teraforming whatsoever. Ive never encountered any situation where i would want to change my land type. Nor have unhappy people, nor really see any issues being good/evil.-Why we have so many damn resources, gold is fine for the most part, but mana crystals im always swimming in them early on and for the rest of the scenario.Things that shine:-Battles are really fun when in the open areas with a lot of obstacles around.-The unique units are quite diverse so far from what i see-Game isn't the prettiest but I really like the looks of everything-campaign is enjoyable and each level takes a fair bit of time to complete thoroughly and im just playing on easy mode to speed through~ u get a lot of playtime in this game!-The voice acting is quite good, I love the intro dialogues they are read very very well.If you want my comments on anything be sure to post and ask ill give my 2 cents.Hope this is useful lol			"

												Should you buy Age of Wonders 3? Yes, but there's a catch.ABOVE AVERAGE for its priceThe game is visually impressive with a lot of love and care taken to make the game the best it could possibly be. The problem is, the game lacks... ambition. The combat is really all there is to the game and while its fulfilling early on, it tends to drag on late game. You'll spend hours clearing the resource points of monsters and enemy camps to build a safe and sprawling empire only to realize that your empire is just to feed your warmachine, nothing else. At which its very easy to proclaim yourself the winner because what reward is there to finishing a solo game?Which leads to the other problem, multiplayer. 4x strategy games are really meant for multiplayer matches. Its a wonderful race to see who can build what faster, stronger, and diplomatic better. However AoW 3 doesn't lend itself well to MP games because of time and lack of any real substantial diplomacy.-time, essentially you either sacrifice time to enjoy the game and its combat the way its meant to be played, or you turn the quick autobattles on and skip over the big tactical portion of the game. Its a lose lose either way.-Diplomacy is lacking because there is no real benefit to peace other than a secure border but, who's to say your peaceful neighbor won't just backstab you? As there is no consequence for breaking your word, no morale penalties, no reduced gold income or productivity, nothing. The flip side is also true, no economical advantages to being at peace :(Despite all that its still a good game and I enjoyed very much of it, its just sad to see so much potential fizzle out.+Graphics, a very rich, visually appealing game+Tactical combat is very satisfying+-Replay value is there, but late game becomes tedious management and busy work... I've yet to finish a single random scenario-No tech tree, research randomness in a strategy game is a bit disappointing-Good luck finding a rewarding mp experience for a game that is by design, not meant for multiplayer-DLC is a bit disapointing			"

												This game is just getting better and better. At first, I was a bit disappointed but for each expansion added they just added more and more content to the game. More campaigns, more scenarios, more races, new class. It start to feel more and more like Age of Wonders 1 again but with a class system and city building for more controlled expansion. For each patch, for each expansion it just becomes better! It should be a game in every X4 fans collection. To put it on something familiar, add a dose of Heroes 3, add a dose of Civilisation, add a does of roleplaying. You get Age of Wonders III.  A 9 out of 10 game right now for me. But I might be a bit biased, being a long term fan of 15 years with this series. But I recommend it to everyone who enjoy this kind of games.			"

												I love every game in the AOW series. AOW III is everything that was done right in AOW 1 and AOW2 put together into one game. My only complaint about the game is that there is some kind of weird graphical corruption. It is hard to describe its mostly visible as a flicker in certain pieces of terrain like lava or the underground forests. This EXACT same issue was there in AOW2. It makes the game unstable. It is very annoying to see bugs carrying over into sequels. I've this bug on many different computers at this point so talk of graphics cards and drivers being at fault is ridiculous. The same damn bug happens on linux as well as the windows version!But everything else about the game is awesome and it is hands down the best fantasy TBS strategy game I've ever played.  "

												It's a really good 4X game, but nothing stellar. Unfortunately this game follows in the terrible footsteps of price gouging you with DLCs that should be in the original game. The default factions in the game are tiresome and repetative. I think the developers couldve done more to give you quality and depth without the DLC addons. I REALLY hate the DLC practice!Building and empire expansion is mediocre. The graphics and combat are the real strengths of this game. Is that worth it to you? I dont know. I was a huge fan of the originals and so the graphics is what hooked me, but even so I waited for a sale. I'm very happy to not buy this at full price especially after their crummy and greedy DLC releases.Anyway, pick it up on sale. The game is worth no more than $20-25.00 IMHO.However, I do recommend it for fans of the genre.			"

												This game is great whether you're a fan of the series, a fan of strategy games, or just a newcomer to these kind of games. Learning the gameplay might take a tad bit but when you start playing you'll find yourself bargaining time away just so you can play one more turn. The single player is pretty much where most people start, in order to learn the game mechanics and the game does that pretty well, by the time I got to the thrid level I was already building proper armies, upgrading cities, and destroying other empires. The game's AI is smart even on easy and you will find them hitting your weak points if you underestimate them while the hardest difficulty pushes you to use everything in your power to win, also although you can build alliances with the AI it is actually very hard to do so because most of the time they're in it for themselves but then again so are we so peace most of the time will not be in your options. You can also fight the battles yourself on a field but after awhile I just kept using auto battle unless it was a battle that I needed to be won then I took control but do know that one level can take a long time to complete because you'll be managing your cities, planning strategies for the future, or something else which will take time unless you're blitzing all the time. The music really is well made, the graphics are great, the multiplayer is fun and in a nutshell this game is very entertaining			"

												6 hrs in review...So far its going great i'm going going for a goblin warlord kinda feel on a extra large continent map. It has just the right amount of rpg and rts elements, you can auto battle anything to avoid the manual battling but you can almost always provide a more effective strategy in the manual battle reminisent of FFT and other tile based turn based rpgs. The other heros and squad management aswell as the ability to have other teams assist you in a manual battle similiar to having other generals in warband join your fight. Very good so far.			"

												Age of Wonders III is a fantastic game of which I feel like I have dumped too much of my life into already but can't help but keep coming back to it. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys civilization but also loves to lose themselves in a fantasy universe. This game however can become challenging at times and you might even find yourself losing a mission in the campaign where you have no choice but to restart the mission since you backed yourself into a corner. Overall though, its a definite purchase I would make again.			"

												Very good game with alot of content. Especially the random maps are good (with lots of sliders to tune it to your liking incase you would want that), but the campaigns are also decent and there are loose scenario maps. Keep in mind though that while this is tagged as a 4x game, the combat part (turn based) is dominant and leveling up your hero and units is very important too. In short combat and exploration are really important.I highly recommend buying the game with the 2 expansions Golden Realm and Eternal Lords. Not only are new classes, races and specialisations added, some addional gameplay features are added and new ways to win.+ lots of possible combinations by picking your race and your class and spell specialisations. E.g. a sorcerer that summons whole armies, or a necro that has undead armies, or a dreadnought that has many machines. + be dark (plunder villages and kill of whole races), gray or good (e.g. helping villages with quests so they will join your empire or as vassals), based on actions and not race. Do whatever you like. Also several decisions in the storyline that you can make. + rich maps filled neutral ctities, hideouts, dungeons, recources, neutral places that give bonuses to nearby cities, tavern to hire units, etc. etc.  Lots of places to level up and gain loot. Also secundary quests. + The random map generator is one of the best I have ever seen. + lots of units and quite a bit of buildings and upgrades for villages/cities.+ the bigger your empire with a race and the longer you have it, the more race bonuses you will get (you pick between upgrades).+ all units can rank up which give them interesting abilities and add lots of tactics. With your leader and heroes you can pick between quite a bit upgrades/abilities per level up.+ lots of items, spells and abilities.+ less RNG than similar games.+ good backlore.+ moddable and there are mods for it.-/+ can be difficult to turtle or forward base defending tactics, though with some classes and races its more viable.- a map can get tough when you have a bad start (e.g. you lose some starting units or are to slow with leveling them). - still some annoying RNG, but luckily not so much.- minor point: while campaings are decent, I feel that the story could have been more epic. Can't really put my finger on it though, since the backlore (especially with AoW 1 and 2) is pretty expansive.My score: 9. Pro's to the developers for having patched this game many times.			"

												It's a good game. I think it's more fun than Civ 5, but I agree with some of the reviewers that some of the game mechanics don't make sense. A squad with 1 hp still doing full damage and the flanking rules don't work really well. It's better in many ways than AOW: Shadow Magic with the more 4x elements. But there are some problems... The tools for managing lots of cities and armies are lacking. There's a global spell that the enemy can cast that lower all your armies moral so you can't win any battles and everyone leaves you by the time you can cast a disenchant strong enough for it, so that's pretty unbalanced. It's difficult to get used to right-clicking all the time after playing modern games, so it'd be nice to have an option to have that work differently.			"

												Fell in love, this game with its expansions is  overly fun and addicting. Got it on sale in my country and soon bought the expansions on steam for normal price and found they are very much worth it.If you like what you see on their promo videos, you will propably like it or love it ;).Game has many so many different  ways to play either solo or with friends: Many different difficulty and size ready campaings with a plot and ready made leaders (though those are not not my cup of thea rlly), many ready made scenarios with a set map or the very highly customizable and to me the oh so addicting random maps with expansion added customizable win conditions, not just rush and crush yer enemy, but call for diplomacy and patience too. On scenario or random maps you can customize your leader from the start, and not just skills, make them look fabulous (or wicked fabulous) too, wich I love, makes me very attached to them  :D!And you can save the looks and start skills of your new leaders to a custom char ""base"", to choose them later as your chars or enemies again in another game.Char/Class skill developement way feels very exiting to me cause there is an element of chance to what new skills you get to research with time or what you and your heroes get each lvl . With 166 hours played and diff chars I still feel happy to see new skills for main char or heroes, or eagerly await for something to pop up I`d rly like.Class and race options feel like making a big difference in gameplay and make me want to try out more combinations.And fun: you can even play with or against your self= set all or some players to ""human"" at  random map options and you can take turns with multiple self created chars, of course with ai enemy added if you  so choose.Even wage war on yourself, and use ""autocombat"" in battle if you want the ai to take over one char to prevent you from cheating any ;) And, if like me you like to take your time  and make a solo all human game to  exlore the random  world ""for ages ""in one game, choose an extra large map with win conditons either  Unify or Seals , make your all human crazy group to switch turns and either work together or try to snuff each other. Either way, if you left the roaming independents on in your setting, you should  still scout the lands for threats early ( dangerous spawn points that get harder with lvl ) before a herd of bonedragons comes knocking just when you thought your  halfling Metropolis of ""Happytown"" is doing so good in a happy solo game ... Happened to me ;)Cheers, my two cents!=A Highly recommended game! Feels like it was very lovingly made by the devs :DPS. and modding. So nice to have modding. Currently using visual mods that unlock all outfits and hairs for races and classes, more leader flag /outfit colurs and raise undead turned to a better looking skeletal army :D			"

												In an age of expensive, flashy, superficial games, here is one that stands apart. I never played AoW2, but I played the original and it's one of my favorite classic games, right up there with Age of Empires: Age of Kings, and AoW3 is true to its roots. Newer games tend to shed the characteristics that made their predecessors great in favor of aspects that make good trailers and build extraordinary hype, only to fall flat on release when everybody finds out how shallow they are. Not this one. AoW3 delivers a deep experience that you can approach from a number of different ways: there's campaigns, scenarios, multiplayer--and random map, which is by far the best feature. For The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, Bethesda randomly generated a world the size of Great Britain. Once. AoW3 does that every time you start a new random map. Yeah, they're not really comparable, but the point is made. No two random maps are the same. A single, 8-player, extra large random map will get you your money's worth out of AoW3, then you'll start a new one as a different race, different class, different school of magic, and you'll do it again and it'll be all-new. You'd better quit reading reviews and get started.  "

												As for someone, who spent quite some time of his childhood playing Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic, information about sequel get was like a god's gift. Which of course lead me to fear, that AoW 3 will be one of the many disappointing sequel's of amazing games (like Heroes V and onward, Disciples and Majesty to name a few).I couldn't be any further from truth! This game is not only as good as it's precedessor, but I could even argue that it's better, getting rid of some annoying mechanics and replacing them with something actually more fun. While the game isn't free of mistakes, the developers work hard on it, and actually already have fixed a lot issues with gameplay I had when I started playing this.If you wanna try something of a mix between Civilization and Heroes with an actually pretty interesting story and climatic world... Well, I'd recommend you exactly this one.			"

												One of the best games of this genre since Heroes of Might and Magic II... seriously amazing!  It follows the same style where you pick a main hero who has a race and a class, with three specialties (Spell Masteries, traits etc).  You build cities and go exploring and BATTLING.  Yeah, the game is all about the combat so if you're looking for something like CIvilization you will be sorely disappointed with this one.  The combat is excellent and strategic.  Units can level up during battles, and eventually, can become quite strong if they've been with you since the beginning of the game.  The game has flanking, attacks of opportunity, line of sight bonuses and penalties (however, no friendly fire with ranged attack, so that's a plus), Overwhelm, Status Effects, Special Movement Types... I don't know what more you could ask for in the combat part. In terms of things that aren't combat like city management, etc... Yeah - it's limited.  Diplomacy leaves me scratching my head and there's no options to make other players necessarily like you, just peace treaties or alliance proposals.  City buildings basically fall into either resource production (for that glorious army you're building) or unit recruitment buiildings so it's easy enough to get into.  It may be rather simple, but that's how Heroes of Might and Magic II was and man if this isn't the spirtual succesor to that game I don't know what is.			"

												4.5 Stars - An engaging strategy epic that will easily hit home for fans of games like Civilisation and the HoMM series.I hadn't played the earlier AoW gamess when I started this but was very happy with the mix of emprie building and tatical battles. The core game contians two campaigns which alone can be 100+ game hours.The combinations of racial benefits and class skills give you strategic freedom into your city buiding and army mix. Heroes have RPG elements and will become significantly powerful with both levels and loot over the course of the campaign.Pros -Tatical BattlesReplayability & game sizeEmpire designCons -Artwork can appear clumsy on lower resolutions tho the prevelance of small detiails will overcome this if you can play on higher settings			"

												Buyer beware. If you are a fan of strategy games, combat/war simulators, and like to read about every little detail of every single unit, this game will own your life. Hours tick by as if they were minutes. Sometimes I wont rest until Ive explored every nook and crany of the map, hoping to find special treasure for my generals like an amazing staff that acts as a magical melee weapon, and the ability to call down an aoe storm. Or a black wyvern mount... whats cooler then a general riding atop a black mini dragon? Anyway, buy this game, for real.			"

This is what makes me prefer this game over games like Civlization. Races are varied and with interesting strengths and flaws. Also - Great map generator.			"

												The game is a winner, as far as I have played it so far. I have always been a fan of strategy, whether it be turn-based or real-time, but also have like many other genres too. I have many games that compete for my limited game time, but this one is winning hands-down at the moment. While there are some definite 'Heroes of Might and Magic' parallels, it feels much more holistic. The tactical fighting is great, and just gets better the more I learn about the units and the mechanics. The leveling system for each unit is great, and makes you really try to keep the unit alive, granting better powers and giving each experienced unit a sense of being less 'replaceable' by the next newly produced unit. This means that rather than sending them to their doom just to finish the battle faster, or being too careless or clumsy, you really want to make sure they get involved (to get more xp), but keep them from sacrificing themselves for a worthless cause.The Heroes are great, and with so much customisation as they level up, it leaves you forever wishing you had more points to throw at their skills. This also makes it juicily special when they level up. And, even better is that it can really make a difference to the battles, whether it be the spells that enhance your 'shock troopers' to take and dish-out a heap of punishment, or enhancing your hero so they themselves become a mobile game-changer wherever they tread.The city development is interesting too. It does not boast the most exhaustive list of buildings, but in the early-mid game it promotes the development of a city so that it specialises in one or two troop types. I really like this because it means you can plan your overall strategy with more effectiveness. Including thinking about how to get your slow-moving troops to the enemy - do you build them in the close cities, or build roads between cities, or keep each city more generic and have lower level or lower tiered troops. Lots of delicious approaches.Another big plus is the ability to play offline. Which is great as I often travel. Cloud auto-saves can also help me progress on either my PC or laptop.If you like strategy, and multiple approaches to victory - then this game is for you. Heroes class and race make a difference, and the constant difficult choice of which spells and skills to choose is fantastic. Runs surprisingly well on low specs too.Cons - can't save the game mid-way through a battle, music is not amazing (but who really plays these games for the music).Please enjoy!			"

												Have to give this game the highest recommendation- it's currently the king of the fantasy 4X genre (and this is despite me loving Sorcerer King as well), provided you get the expansions.It's lots of fun using Goblins in this game- how many games have fun Goblins?   You can also kill Notch if you feel like it.That said, Notch is good people in my book just for helping to fund this game.Lots of options to choose from,  good MP options, lots of variety.The only real knocks I put on the game is that it's a bit slow to launch , and the AI can't play by all of the rules of a human, unlike GalCiv3, but even there it does a competent enough job.PBEM option is great as well.

As said by others: the campaigns and scenario's are great fun, but you will buy this game because of the random map generator: it makes it like a well made fantasy-themed Civ with tactical combat.

												TL;DRAwesome turn based strategy game. Main campaign is frustrating in spots, but very doable on normal difficulty. I've put in over 100 hours already and still love the game.I have been on the look out for a modern replacement of Master of Magic. I can honestly say that this game may be the game that takes Master of Magic's place for me. Only time will tell, but the initial testing seems to point to a yes. The Heroes and items in Master of Magic are still possibly better. The main thing is that there are multiple ways of making a hero in Master of Magic that is for all practical purposes invincible. Some may say that's a bad thing, but I always liked it. Also, the spells in Master of Magic are truly awesome and there are a ton of spells. There are very few bad / useless spells in Master of Magic. And, so long as your heros have mana, they can each cast a spell every turn. The main disappointment for me in Age of Wonders 3 is that you can only cast one spell per turn in combat. The upside, is there are some cool abilities that are essentially spells, but don't count as a spell. Call Lightning, Thunder Storm, Guardian Flames are a few good examples. All in all, I am seriously enjoying the treasure hunting, city smashing, and magic. I may still go back to Master of Magic from time to time, but Age of Wonders 3 is a true contender in the niche that Master of Magic has been the Master of for so long. (The Age of Wonders games before this never captured my attention as much as Age of Wonders 3 and while good, weren't as good as Master of Magic.)			"

												7/10Age of Wonders III combines elements of basic city building with tactical combat and simplistic RPG aspects. The tactical battles are fun and are Age of Wonder's main component. On the downside, the storyline gets tedious as you seem to reset your progress as you move to each map. Instead of following one team of epic heroes from the beginning to the end, you are constantly introduced to new heroes that you need to level up to make them useful in a fight. Following a single team throughout the entire game would have been a more fun and rewarding experience. After completing several scenarios I grew bored with the structure of the game and continuously having to burn through turn after turn just to explore a new map. If you don't mind the tedium, the tactics battles are worth the meandering storyline and slow-paced campaign interface.			"

												At first I did not know what to make of this game. But I felt intrigued enough to keep playing. Then I slowly started unraveling the intricacies and the secrets and I got absolutely hooked.The biggest draw for me, is the degree of customisation it offers. There are literally dozens of combinations of race/class/specialisation combined with random maps which are quite configurable, and a lot of different tweaks for each game map. One game you might be playing a Frostling Sorcerer with master destruction and rain death (and stun) on your foes, next game a Dwarf Theocrat rising from the caves below the surface to conquer everything, specializing in wild magic with unpredictable results. Then a Tigran Warlord Grey Guard, bashing down all opposition. Then later you might revisit the Frostling sorcerer, but be lucky enough to have a building that makes your Ice Queens practically immortal (if you end up winning the fight) inside your domain. What I'm getting at, is not only are all of these options extremely fun to play around with and figure out interesting and powerful combinations, but they offer a replayability rarely seen in games.Really this game is amazing and you should check it out if you are a fan of Turn Based Strategy games. If only HoMnM games were half this good these days...EDIT 24/11/16 This game is still being updated. Triumph Studios rock!			"

												One of the best games of this genre since Heroes of Might and Magic II... seriously amazing!  It follows the same style where you pick a main hero who has a race and a class, with three specialties (Spell Masteries, traits etc).  You build cities and go exploring and BATTLING.  Yeah, the game is all about the combat so if you're looking for something like CIvilization you will be sorely disappointed with this one.  The combat is excellent and strategic.  Units can level up during battles, and eventually, can become quite strong if they've been with you since the beginning of the game.  The game has flanking, attacks of opportunity, line of sight bonuses and penalties (however, no friendly fire with ranged attack, so that's a plus), Overwhelm, Status Effects, Special Movement Types... I don't know what more you could ask for in the combat part. In terms of things that aren't combat like city management, etc... Yeah - it's limited.  Diplomacy leaves me scratching my head and there's no options to make other players necessarily like you, just peace treaties or alliance proposals.  City buildings basically fall into either resource production (for that glorious army you're building) or unit recruitment buiildings so it's easy enough to get into.  It may be rather simple, but that's how Heroes of Might and Magic II was and man if this isn't the spirtual succesor to that game I don't know what is.			"

												Of all 4X games, this is my favourite. I have been a fan of the AoW series since 1999, and believe that this game borrows nicely from its predecessors but also introduces fantastic new features and content. The game is very detailed, with huge amounts of units, spells and abilities (many more than the previous games). The strategic map is beautiful, has many varied features and is always different thanks to the excellent random map generator. The tactical map is much improved, and is similarly pleasing to the eye. Units have the ability to flank, to gang up on stronger units and tie them up; these features improve this mode greatly. The addition of classes (e.g. rogue, Sorcerer) to the existing race based system is something that some people like and others do not. The negatives say that the emphasis is clearly on class and that choice of race doesnt matter. However, the classes arguably make up for this as they bring many different units and spells. Also, Triumph have been adding changes that improve racial diversity. One thing to mention here is that Triumph seem to want to listen to the community. Many gripes about the game when it came out have been addressed. As a company they seem to be passionate about what they do, giving the fans what they want and not being too mercenary in their approach to DLC etc.If I had to say what was wrong with the game, there would be two minor gripes. Firstly, while sieges look visually impressive, they are all virtually the same. Every time you must attack the same shape of city wall and seeing as sieges are so common a battleground, sometimes the game can feel (slightly) monotonous for this reason.Secondly, while multiplayer (player versus player) is exciting, it can be awkward to organise games and can be very time consuming. Basic things like an in lobby chat have been left out. The community often uses house rules like 'no attacking in the first 15 seconds of the turn' and 'do not purposefully attack my stacks of units to take my adjacent stacks out of the fight'. These make perfect sense and are used for nearly all games, but it relies on player honesty. I hope that triumph addresses this in a future patch. The signs are positive as they have implemented a number of positive changes to multiplayer already. I must say that multiplayer is a lot of fun and would recommend it for those that have patience. To sum this game up; it has a rich fantasy setting, looks fantastic, has awesome empire building features and tactical battles, and it is genuinely improving with the additions of new patches and DLC.

												I recommend this game but only just and here is why. First of all, let's start off with the positives about this game. The graphics are excellent and there is a lot of replay value in this game. The storyline is very interesting if these type of RPG games interest you as this is one of those turn-based games with a somewhat unpredictable outcome. So carefull planning is advisable. I like the scenario mode the best as the Draconians is my preferred clan that I like to use that is leaded by Rish Kyan. While I am not going to spoil anything. You will have to play the game yourself to fully experience it. The game also has multiplayer mode when you can play matches against your friends. So that is some of the good parts that this game has but the major downside is with the AI as in my experiences and with two days of not much progress. From what I have learned is that if you upgrade and max out your units. The AI will be much stronger and tougher to beat and in some cases. The AI is not that well balanced from my experiences of playing this game as it is just too aggressive in easy mode for a casual gamer which can be frustrating. All in all. that is the only one major downside to an otherwise a very enjoyable game :).Overall Rating: 7/10.			"

												Quick review: the Fantasy version of Civilization V.Long review: If you are looking at this review it is because you like Strategy Turn-Base Games and Fantasy. If you do, this is your game. Age of Wonders III is the fourth game of this title (If you think of Shadow's Magic as the third) and it is incredible. The game has many races, roles, classes, units, powers, etc... It is endless fun. You can make your own maps. MAKE YOUR OWN MAPS. You can have random maps! Campaign! Awesomenes! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! STOP READING YOU USELESS STEAM USER, GO BUY THE GAME ALREADY! I HAVE 0 COMPLAINS ON IT. GOSH, BUY IT. ∞/10			"

												This game is very complex, it doesn't compromise its complexity trying to streamline it (like Civilization: Beyond Earth which I recently played and didn't like). This game, instead, celebrates its complexity by finely balancing it and making everything in the game be worth using, even Tier 1 units which in nearly every other game (including its predecessors) become obsolete by mid-game.The turns play fast, battle auto-resolving works acceptably well and actually simulates the battles instead of making an oddball calculation based on numbers. You have the option to make your heroes survive auto-resolved battles if you win them (to avoid the strong annoyance of the CPU suiciding your heroes), thus relieving you of a lot of unwanted micromanagement.The tactical battles in the game are detailed, very enjoyable, and also optional! —since the auto-resolve feature plays fine—. You can replay auto-resolved battles to learn the game's complex tactical combat by watching the computer (I learned partly that way).The graphics, music and interface of the game are excellent. If you play with low detail graphics you may have Age of Wonders II flashbacks  =)  specially with antialiasing off. You can run this game in moderately old hardware (something other modern games can't).Excellent Turn-Based Strategy Game, a personally refreshing sight after failures like Civilization: Beyond Earth and Heroes VI. Get it on a discount sale if you're hesitant. I'm sure you'll be buying the expansions rather soon  =)( The expansions added new victory conditions and even more variety to an already spicy game. The base victory mode in random scenarios in this game is conquest. Check the reviews ) "

												In the era, when the huge companies are either streamlining the previous games with usualll tendency to loose anything from the atmosphere of the old best sellers (yes, Heroes, im talking about You...) or even trying to squeeze Your wallets with so called HD feature stripped reedition (Yes, again Heroes of Might and Magic) asking You to pay a full price there it is - something out of the today standards.Despite always being somewhere in the shadow of HoMM series, AoW series is nowhere behind the legacy of turn based fantasy strategic games. And even if it obviously was overshadowed by allmighty Heroes III (which is probably the best game ever for majority of players reading this review - me included) at the times where Age of Wonders 2 was published (even, despite my opinion it was pretty much equally good in some terms), its no longer a case.Heroes series lost all of it glory throughour the years. Age of Wonders, resurrected not so far ago. And in a contrast of really average attempts to recover HoMM franchise, Triumph Studios made it done. This is the game every AoW fan was waiting for, and this is the game all the turn based fantasy strategic games fans should head into now. There is absolutely no other game in the genre with so much detail, fun and polish.Of course, the game has some issues (like multiplayer connection which for no reason tries to establish p2p connection which is kind off archaic method) but developers are constantly updating the game based on our feedback.So if You really enjoyed playin HoMM 3 twenty years ago, and You would love to feel something similar today - go grab it. You'll love it. "

												Amazing company who returned and produced an amazing game. All 4X fans should definately give this a go. I really hope this game continues to thrive and do well. As gamers, we always yell and holler about how terrible these game companies are, and when one finally manages to show up and prove that they actually care, people all of sudden are disinterested  and dont want to show support. Well I for one am not going to let this company go without praise. Triumph Studios did an amazing job, and with all the updates and patches to help make the game even better from suggestions from the community, and the Golden Realms expansion that actually got me to play the halflings for the first time in a AOW game. Phenomal job Triumph.  10/10. Definately looking forward to the Necromancer class!Still best game.			"

												Phenomenal game.  I've not experienced that ""just one more turn"" like this since the original Civ.  And the amount of settings you can arrange when creating a randomly generated game is robust enough that the replay value is huge.Update Dec 2016:  With the recent patch just released (how phenomenal is it the devs are still patching this game!) I fired up another campaign and got sucked in all over again in that ""just one more turn"", this game has stood the test of time in my book and now ranks for me as a classic I'll be playing for years to come.

												This by far is one of the best 4X strategy games that i have played in a long time. If you are one who liked civ5 then you will fall in love with this game. Unlike civ5 this game is less based on empire building and more focussed on the battles. 6 units to each army, may not sound like much but a total of 42 units can be in a single battle. Battles normally last anywhere from 5 minutes to nearly a half hour.Then the soundtrack of this game is just amazing. Im one of those people who like to sit back and listen to music and play games. Well in this game the ingame music is actually pretty sick. Online is working and there seems to still be a large community although this game is starting to get a bit old.Performance wise, this game should be able to be ran on almost anything. Very nice graphics for a 4X strategy game and the environment is very detailed.So yes i do reccomend you purchase Age of Wonders III			"

												 It's kind of like playing five or six games of Civ V at the same time, on two maps. If fantasy themed stuff don't turn you off, and if you like 4x strategy of the Civilization variety, it's well worth giving this a try. I'm the type who searches and searches for the perfect game, so I've tried Endless Legend, and Galactic Civilizations, and Empire Earth, and Age of Empires, and Beyond Earth, and on, and on. Age of Wonders 3 is the shizznit.I will say this - if you only play this game for an hour or something and think you've seen it all and it's just silliness.

												Did you see there are a lot of games like other games made many years ago? It's like Hollywood. No new ideas are better than old ideas, so they keep making movies like the ones 20-40-60 years ago.The thing with those ""re-new"" movies is that most of them are a pale homage to those great movies we watched and loved (yeap, I'm old).Well, with games is the same. And this here AoW3 happens the same that with another game that was the third instalment in a series that has an ""o"" as the second of four letters (if you need another clue, the last one is the same as the third).  ;)Lucky for us, this game IS a good homage for that great game. Is it AS good? Hard to say, I didn't play that one in a loooooooong time now, but this one makes an honest effort, and brings back a lot of fond memories. :)Also, it's totally moddable, has 4 campaigns (if you add the DLCs, and you totally should), and it works wonderfully as a port on Linux (which is why I bought it). :)So, if you remember that old ""four letters and a 3"" game and you liked it, give this one a try. It's worth the money. :)			"

												As a long time fan of the series I wanted to like this game I really did, but it is simply one large dissapointment. If you take the last game in the series and remove things you get the new game. Smaller droops stacks, less races, less units, less unit types, weaker AI, Less spells, less spellcasting (1 per turn limit), less fantasy. Combined with a poorer less useful interface and you get a vastly sub par game. The troop stacks have been reduced from 8 to 6 removing much of the tactical play. You now place your 6 biggest units in your stack. Flying has been removed as a feature (can be attacked by ground units) and speical abilities are resisted more often. There is no room for oddball troops in your army. Spell casting is 1 per round, even if you have multiple heroes in your army. The interface is far less user friendly? Want click through armies without orders? Can't unless you end your turn, which leads to ending your turn while some units still haven't gone. Want to accept a diplomacy negotiation? You have click 3 screens deep instead of just saying ""yes"" when someone askes for 100 gold for mana swap. Races now have all the same exact units, class units differ but classes wre wildly unbalanced. This game needs a lot of work in a lot of places. I'd rather play AOW:SM today than this new one. Other than better graphics (which everything else was sacrificed to provide) this game is worse in every way.			"

												I honestly tried my best to like this game. My review concerns the custom map set up. The AI in this game is atrocious and bothers me to no end. Playing on a  higher difficulty does not provide a balanced challenge but a number of AI wizards that zero in on your location. They declare war for seemingly no reason. Along with the annoying AI the game also becomes tedious far too fast. In forcing myself to play this game so I can get to the fun part I realized there was no fun part for me. If you are looking for a good sandbox fantasy strategy game I would look elsewhere.			"

Posted: September 21, 2014
												I'm really torn about this game, because it does so much right and I hate to be negative about a game that's so close to being great. I'm going to hit on the negatives first so that at least I can end on a positive note.Negatives:There is basically no strategic depth. There is absolutely no reason not to use the highest tier units as soon as possible, none of the units really fill a unique role, and in the end there's really just no point in building lower-tier units if higher tiers are available. The strategy boils down to ""who can get high-tier units produced the fastest"". The Total War series is an example where this was usually done fairly well, though admittedly not anywhere near perfect.The classes aren't very well balanced: Sorcerers are incredibly powerful, since they can summon tier 4 units wherever they are and it costs no gold to do so. It allows them to effectively push forward and defend anywhere at any time. On the opposite end of the spectrum are Theocrats, who have basically nothing worth using in their own trees and must rely entirely on specializations.The specializations aren't very diverse: The elemental ones are all almost exactly parallel with each other (not in relative power, but in the fact that the powers are all the same with reskins and a number or two tweaked), the destruction and creation specializations don't do anything meaningful, and the explorer specialization is entirely useless. Honestly I think I'd've scrapped this entirely. It feels bolted-on. You can completely ignore your specialization and it'll have no effect on your gameplay most of the time.The races all feel exactly the same. I don't know if there are differences outside small hit point variances in the units or not, but if there are any they're very minor. For an example of this done better, see Heroes of Might & Magic (2, 3, or 5, if you want a specific one, basically any but 6 because that game is sadness in game form.)The research tree is an absolute mess: it requires rote memorization to figure out what research leads where. In some cases it's fairly obvious, in others it seems random if you haven't sunk a significant amount of time into the game. This is a really common problem in strategy and tactical games. Sins of a Solar Empire had this done fairly well, as did XCOM's newest incarnations (in different ways, obviously).Tactically there are a few options, but the tactical combat is incredibly and painfully repetitive. The A.I. has been improved some, but still isn't especially good. In truth I don't have a great answer for a game where this was done exceptionally well. In RTS games it usually isn't a problem, since the computer is just made more aggressive with more resources. Turn based games are a tougher nut to crack, though. Shogun 2 was one with a reasonably good A.I., but certainly not an excellent one.Multiplayer games with simultaneous turns are abysmally un-fun. Simultaneous turns in general don't work, with some units freezing in place when attacked by an enemy (when you would normally move away before the enemy could get in close), and generally team-turns would work much better than the way simultaneous turns work now.Now for the good stuff:Each of the classes does play in a unique way. The specializations may not make much difference, but the classes are incredibly varied and have a good blend of niche and flexible abilities.The game looks remarkably good for the most part. It's not graphically brilliant, but the art design was well put together, you have a lot of options for how your main hero will look and nothing looks cheap.While it's a bit of a mixed bag, the spellcasting/ability use in general is generally entertaining and can have a fairly significant effect on the tides of battle.The UI is mostly intuitive, though it too has a few areas that would benefit from clearer labelling.That's what I've got. Hope it helps!			"

												A 4x fantasy game that has all the elements you could wish for, allowing it to make a real challenge at being arguably the best in its genre. But does it live up to its sparkle ?If you're old enough to remember Master of Magic, then you will know the precursor game that AoW III has built itself on. If you're not old enough, then AoW is a game of the same family as Warlock, or any of the fantasy mods for Civ. A turn based fantasy game you will spend your time exploring a map, expanding your empire, exploiting resources and finally exterminating your enemies. A 4x to the core. Whilst there have been innumerable takes on this formula, AoW III promises to bring all these things together with a decent rub of polish and just enough depth to really please the 4x audience.And in many ways the game does just that - a nice tactical combat system that brings depth to the strategic map manoeuvres without overstaying its welcome. A diverse and interesting number of resources to exploit. Bucketfuls of different army units and racial types. And so on.But despite all this, and despite it looking great, the game has some flaws. And when you get to playing it, those flaws really start to bite.The first flaw is the simultaneous move implementation. Turn based games can turn into a tedious snore fest if they opt for a me go you go type mechanic. Fortunately in this day and age such things are rare ( with the exception of the woeful coding of Warlock ), but in AoW III the simultaneous movement has a hitch. Everything and everyone moves simultaneously - players, AI kingdoms, independents. And the AI has a beautifully machine like grief play style where it can wait for you to make a single move somewhere, before rolling forward its units to sneak in the back door and take that town from you.Woops.So maybe you shouldn't move out of that town. At all. Ever. A bizarre nervouse mexican stand off ensues where the AI stares you down waiting for you to misclick or even just investigate a passing army before rushing in to capitalise. And it's no good clicking once you've taken that step - particularly if you are playing in a multiplayer network game - as the whole thing then lags and chugs busy processing its own fabulously griefing move whilst your frantic clicks can sit and wait.In practice the simultaneous movement with AIs on the field of play quickly becomes irritating - and it starts to warp play into some neurotic twitch fest. It's not the first game to implement this type of nervous who clicks first simultaneous play, but here, combined with a simplistic ""IS IT OK FOR ME TO ATTACK NOW"" state AI, it can often prove enormously frustrating.Fortunately simulaneous movement is optional.Non simultaneous movement then goes back to the tedious me go you go turn order. But at least you can go out explore something and be home for tea without the griefing AI kicking your door down mid journey. Well. Mostly.The second flaw to the game is that towns don't have an implicit defence. That is to say, if a town is empty, anyone can just walk in and take it. Sound reasonable ? Sure. What's the problem ? Remember that hair trigger wait for you to move ""IS IT OK TO ATTACK NOW"" AI ? It's still here. And as soon as you even look like you are leaving somewhere empty or under strength, then with annoying regularity the AI marches an army up. I couldn't swear to it, but the AI also has an uncanny knack to ""know"" when you have left somewhere light, and proceeds to quickly march from over the horizon to its target goal. Meh.In practice with the AI staring you down waiting for you to set a single foot outside your door, you end up with the gratuitous full army stack just sitting kicking its heels defending a town. FOR THE REST OF THE GAME. You can see why many games just abstract city defence away, as it's a no brainer you want to always defend a city.But maybe you're ok with that. Seeing a stack of troops in every town, and the maintenance of them - the retiring of old redundant units, the creating of new  better ones, and the whines from their heroes as they slowly level up, and the movement difficulties getting around that fat stack is fine. No problem.Third flaw in the game. Unit balance. As you proceed up your tech tree, most units become pretty much worse than useless. In fact, if you are not spamming out your top tier units, then you're probably doing it wrong. And if those low tier units do engage those high tier ones ? Splat. Well ! That's just the march of progress ! That's to be expected ! Except it's kind of broken here. In something like Civ your units in the field will get dragged through the ages with an upgrade - that unit of Warriors you've had kicking around since 4000BC are now some fancy 20th century Infantrymen. And you will no longer be able to produce those ancient warriors. In AoW there is no such handling. Those idiot Tier I guys will still be walking around. Sucking up resources. Bloating out stacks. And you can go right on producing those stick wielding primitives right into the era of ""space travel"" - the highest tiers. Which is kind of pointless. And irritating. So for all those fancy units, it ends up just a race for the highest tier - with a few exceptions. The subtleties of rock paper scissors are quickly washed away in a My Tank beats EVERYTHING you have.Fourth flaw in the game, and this really does spoil the game, is the nature of the AI. The AI is the worst kind of griefing AI - the kind of player that will happily sit there and repeat play the same chequers move until eternity, just so they stop you winning. It's a sad fact that to placate the human player customer base, an AI has to sometimes take the higher road, the non optimal choice and  break out of that loop of incessant taunting moves. In AoW the AI has no such good sportsmanship tendencies and will happily bounce armies back and forth as you trigger each AI decision tree. Move to the left ? Your enemy to the right will charge. Move to the right ? Your enemy to the left will charge. Quickly go back the other direction ? Your enemies will mirror your move. Rinse and repeat.So the AI is tricky you think. What's the issue ? You're just whining about a hard AI !The AI is not hard particularly. Just annoying. As are the other issues with the game. All of which combines in a perfect storm to produce a game that after a while becomes just plain irritating. You don't have fun. It becomes like managing an annoying spoiled nephew. Until you question why you are even playing the stupid game, and hell doesn't Civ or Warlock give a  much more enjoyable experience ?And there's the problem. AoW has all the right bits, all the right polish and yet... through a few interesting design choices... manages to trip over and face plant to produce an annoying not quite there game.The irritating aspects of the game do shine through - and until recently another annoying ( And pointless ? ) aspect of game play was an AI that would endlessly spam dispells. Sound tactics ? Sure. Annoying griefy play that tends to break any possible use of global spells ? Yes. It's something that you can see hasn't really been thought about how it plays out. It's an AI which is not good at playing humans - it's good at playing itself.If you were being very harsh, you might almost say someone looked at all the requested things for a 4x, mixed them together and baked for half an hour - but without any clue whatsoever as to what *tastes good*.At its best there is a good game somewhere in AoW. At it's worst its an annoying experience with a minor sprinkling of bugs to spice things up a bit.Personally I am still perservering with it - I like the bits that are good, and it can play for a while as a nice game, on the other hand I really hate the bits that fail, they really jar you out of the game and produce a frustrating, lets go play something else type vibe.

												AOW3 is an empire building game/ combat game with a fantasy theme. On paper, it sounds great; but in reality it isnt massively interesting.  The variety in gameplay comes through the tech trees in both what your cities are producing and on the special abilities that you can impose on your empire. But both trees are relatively short and you can reach the end of both a long way before you end a game. Like a lot of empire building games, the more cities you build, the more tedious it becomes. Sadly, the combat is also repetitive - the same maps with the same enemies in the same positions. It takes a short while to get used to, but once you do, you will be applying the same tactics over and over again.In short, there isnt much to recommend the game. Its not terribly programmed, but there just isnt enough depth to keep you interested.			"

												Firstly, I am a big fan of the Age of Wonders franchise. However, this game was not entertaining compared to the previous titles. Besides better graphics and a new class, the game does not have that much new content to offer. Every match I found to be repetitive and slow. In previous Age of Wonders games I found each conflict to be new and require unique different ways of playing. In this release, I find myself repeating the same tactics over and over. The story in this game is not exciting and I found myself skipping through it in both campaigns. Overall, I give this game a 5/10. Pick up AoW 2 versus this title. You'll save some money and have a better experience. All in all, this game is not worth the buy.			"

												I remember playing Age of Wonders 1 and 2 so long ago.  I can't recall how many hours I dumped into those games, especially the second one.  It was the reinvention of Master of Magic, and I loved it.  You get the great world map combined with many fantastic races and tactical combat on separate maps.  I could not have been happier.  It was the fantasy version of Civilization in many respects.When I saw AoW3, I got anxious.  Finally it released, and I got to play it.  It truly has everything to remind me of the previous versions I loved, and then some.  Random Maps, finally.  Relevant units, yay.AoW3 has random maps.  This seems normal, but previously they did not.  So after a while, it becomes mundane with the same strategies and outcomes per scenario.  You can build cities!  Couldn't do that in the old days.  It was all preset and you took what was already there.  Units are relevant now.  In AoW2 the best strategy was to raze every single building and town you took (except your starting city), then destroy the neutral armies that appeared, and farm all the xp and items you could for your starting hero. He becomes nigh invincible, even to tier 3 units, and has absurd movement with flight, so he can just zoom around the map with a scorched earth strategy.  I have not tried to do this in AoW3, but I suspect it would be ineffective.If you liked the previous games in the series, you will still like this one. I cannot say anything bad about it. It is in line with everything I expected it to have. It stays true to the series, and offers some new things. The only thing it doesn't have, is the number of races that the priors had.  No Dark Elves, no Undead, etc... DLC right?  Seems fine.All that being said, I would go 8/10 if you like the genre or the old games.  Personally, it's a 7 for me, and that is just because although I want to enjoy the battles and fight them manually, they become something of a chore to me and I end up auto'ing most of them, even if its a huge super important fight.  I would not have the patience anymore for multiplayer if people do manual fights, yet the prospect of not having the option to manual fight seems to gut a large aspect of the game's draw for me.So I recommend this game overall, but you mind get a little bored with it if you have leaned towards RTS style games since playing AoW2, and maybe that's not worth the cost of the game for you.  Even so, it's a fine product and I am happy to support it, even if I don't play it as much as I thought I would.  (so many good games these days)			"

												This game is a puzzle. Not a puzzler game - it is a jigsaw of likes and disklikes. It has medicore graphics (both models and effects), sound gets a bit annoying at times and the creator of the UI could learn a lot from authors of those implemented f.e. in Might and Magic Heroes VI. BUT!The research is quite fun. The magic is awesome (and I mean owesome in an old style way; if you played Master of Magic, you'd know what i maen) and the resource system is simple and neat. Also you have bazzilion of skills for your heroes (because when they lvl up, you can experience a point based skill buying system - and it's good IMO) and the number of units in game is sick.The way the map is composed is known from titles such as Civ and other 4X fantasy themed games, BUT it also contains ruins, vaults, ancient burial ground, dragon lairs, mana sources, all sort of ""pick me up"" goodies and more.Conclusion: at first I hesitated even considering the game worth playing. But now, after some hours into it I'm happy I have it. If there would be a scale to judge the quality of a game, I would give it a strong 78 out of 100. AND if the devs get to work and create some patches fixing the UI and animation glitches - it will be much more.			"

												Update: As I play it more I must say I think the patches have been critical for the longevity of this game. The 5 stacks of T4 rush was getting a bit annoying. Finally: I must admit I am missing some of the Empire management somewhat more than I thought. Still a great game and better than W2. But the Empire side is better in FE: LH  even if the battles and hero development in this one are much better here. _______Overall great war game with light empire managment. Tact battles are really neat. More like HoMM than Civ. Cons: Tech tree is very confusing as there is no tree/path to follow. Just a book with stuff. Needs some minor fixes with next hero, city, etc... BUt they got the big things right. Wish diplomacy and Empire management were more fleshed out a tiny bit and alternate path to victory was there (End game spell). Overall a very solid game and look forward to the minor issues being fixed by patches.			"

												The end game is not very good due to a lack of diverse choice. There's only one or two end game unit available per game and because theyre strongest, the AI spams this strongest unit available so all you see after a certain point is armies of the same dude.What better strategy than to survive til late game and then spam shadows who each have a 80% damage reduction buff and just bulldoze everyone else?That said, the running around map explorations and leveling your heros and collecting treasures is pretty satisfying.The big big battles involving multiple full-stacked units is too, when you finally decide to stop adventuring and actually ending the game.Would I buy this base game at full price $30 again? Probably not, truth be told, but definitely on discount. And, with the DLCs for sure. The game is jarringly upfront about it being incomplete (smirks at you for only having the base game).I'm going to buy those DLCs now.

												So much fun! As a fan of AoW2 and it's expansion AoW:Shadow Magic, this was a wonderful suprise to see hit Steam. There is many cutomization options for how you build your heroes, the randomly generated maps add LOTS of replayability to the game. The only lacking feature is Diplomacy is not fleshed out as I would hope. BUT the devs have promised to support the game with updates for a few years, so maybe it will get re-amped in the near future.			"

												Once you have maybe 10 hours of gameplay under your belt, you will start to appreciate the subtle changes that the upgradable heroes and combat mechanics bring, and thus the equally subtle innovations that Triumph Studios has made throughout the game. Age of Wonders III is not only a game about magic but it's a magical one at the very same time. Fight, invent, conjure, and enjoy its endless gaming possibilities.			"

												Age of Wonders III has combined the grid-based exploration systems of most cultural building games (such as Civilization, and Age of Empires), and combines it with the turn-based combat systems of a generic Tactical RPG. The only real gripe I HAVE with the game is the inability to construct things like farms and mines, so if you spawn in an area that doesn't have any nearby, you'll likely be screwed upon starting. Other than that, the game is fantastic. Not to mention that the musical score is such a delight.			"

It's much nicer on that level. "

Posted: April 5, 2014
												Age of Wonders III is utterly amazing.My view may be skewed due to putting 100+ hours into the original, but for newcomers to the series I highly recommend this title. The game play is 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) much like the Civilization or Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is set in a high fantasy world ripe with monstrous creatures, dungeons and undead armies. When playing a map (either a scenario, the campaign, or a randomly generated map) you start with a leader unit who, in scenarios or random maps, you create yourself and usually a small army based on one of the five races that you can choose with a city or a city building unit to start your empire. Your leader can level up as they defeat enemies with your armies and gain points to put into unique abilities based on their class and their offensive and defensive statistics. These abilities will help bolster the armies that they lead and push you ever closer to victory. The infantry units you command also gain experience and levels up to four but their abilities and stats are predetermined. Also based on the previously mentioned class and the actions you take to solidify an alignment, either good or evil, are the spells that you research along the way which is reminiscent of technology from the Civ franchise.Along your journey you will more than likely run across heroes that will offer to join you, these characters are much like your leader, they level up the same, they gain abilities based on their class, and they are meant to lead armies. The big difference being that if you lose one of these heroes they are gone, much like other units in your army. Your leader will respawn at your throne city, assuming it's still standing, after a few turns but their friends will not. This makes the battles intense and the losses devastating. The battles are turn based on a hex map based on whatever landscape you're occupying and these maps are gorgeous. They really give you a look at the landscapes that your troops are marching through.The class system mentioned above is a change to the series that after experiencing I can say is welcome. There are very distinct ways that each class works from the technology based, steam punkesque Dreadnaught to the classic magic juggernaut that is the Sorcerer. The Theocrat leads through belief and divine retribution with their crusaders, leading holy wars against their heretical enemies while the Rogue leads through deception, riots, and stealth. The Archdruid taps into the power of nature, summoning animal companions and nature elementals to their side while the Warlord rampages their armies with limited use of magic, ruling through blood, and battle.  Overall the game is a very unique and very fun experience. The soundtrack is breathtakingly beautiful with a few songs being a throwback to the original. Clearly I don't write reviews for a living (I know. ""Too many commas."" ""Where's the sentence structure?"") but I feel like if I were to Age of Wonders would get a 5/5, 10/10, or 100/100. The only gripe I could make is the lack of a few races from the previous games but that's nothing that an expansion or two won't fix. That, and the fact that I can't buy the collectors edition of the game. But life goes on. I'll be spending hours of mine in the Age of Wonders.			"

It doesn't get better than this, ladies and gentlemen. Saddle up for the most fun you can have as a dwarf this side of Mordor! A shining example of 4X strategy. eXplore a gorgeous fantasy world, eXpand your city and the land under your control, eXploit a diplomacy/morale/alignment system to suit your playstyle and eXterminate your opposition in glorious all-out war. Want to send a flamespitting tank against a soaring dragon? you'll lose the tank, but that opportunity is yours to take! A surprisingly deep customization system lets you make a unique hero that affects the units available to you in fun and interesting ways. You WILL have fun playing this game.			"

												I don't see what all the griping is about.  This is a top notch game!  I have loved AOW since my buddy got in on the beta test when Epic was just a 2bit company.  AOW III could have more in it from Wizards Throne (AOW II) , but I am trusting Triumph to get a good amount of DL content.  This game kills HOMM, and Fallen Enchantress.  It was the first game to utilize the Underworld, and Environmental spell effects.  While they have borrowed a little too much from HOMM and dumb down some of the dimensional combat, it's still a great game, could it be better?  Yes, but it is worth the money.  A Huge map will keep you busy for a few days.  The longer you play, in my estimate the more you will get into the mechanics and the depth of the game.  You can choose your own destiny Evil or Good, it all depends on whether you want to slaughter a bunch of friendly nymphs and ferries or make peace with everyone.  Graphics are good, not great but the game play makes up for everything.  If you enjoy HOMM (Hero's of Might and Magic) or Fallen Enchantress then get this game.  You won't regret it.			"

												Long awaited return of one of my favourite TBS series. Only clocked up 6 hours or so but i'm completely sold. The world view is exactly as I remember it (With amazing fantasy visuals) the tactical battles are greatly improved with just about every unit given some utility beyond the obvious.Hopefully there will be a few expansions as the game does need better progression options for heroes and a few more races (I remember the original having far more). But there is more than enough to be getting on with, I can understand why some people have already reached 100 hours of gameplay.			"

												Age of wonders 3 is a turnbased strategygame, with some basebuilding but with a heavy focus on exploration and combat. The look, feel and even some gamemechanics of the game draws heavily upon game like Civilization, Warlock and Heroes of might and magic, wich makes for a easy start into the game, if you are just a bit familiar with these titles. The game offers huge maps to explore, with a lot of sidequest, powerups and ""dungeons"". The terran does impact things like movement and combatwill of your units/armies, as well as the output of certain cities upgrades and even the area in wich combat takes place. The game offers very different ways of upgrading the skills of your heroes, as well as your spells (combat and world) and it really feels like every decision have an impact on the gameplay.Flaws and bugs are few in numbers and rarely more than an slight irritation and never a deal breaker. Definately worth your time and money, if you're into strategy, rpg and empirebuilding.			"

I didn't ever try the campaigns: I bought this game for the random maps, to have an experience closer of a 4x game in a fantasy scenario.And it was so boring. I would literally fall asleep playing the game.Maybe I didn't ""get"" it at first, now that I bought The Golden Realms expansion and tried it again. The game looks a lot more solid. It is fun to play, the A.I. is competent in defending the new gameplay mechanics of Seals. With the expansion it isn't a great game yet , but is a very competent one.			"

												I am enjoying my time with this game but I quickly took a look around the mods and dlc and found there was no race which preffer the subterranean life. While I can understand since subterranean empires are automaticly at a great advantige I still find this development bothersome. Maybe in a future DLC or in a mod I may overlooked due to no rating there is a race or modification that allowes such a change however I would also like to see a custom race builder in the sense of Endless Space. You pick a template (aesthetics and native empire race (which would include the type of units)) and then be able to do a point buy system to create a varient race from the ground up. I wouldn't mind to see the same with classes but I understand that would be WAYYYYYY to difficult. The race builder however I think is quite feesable and would enjoy seeing it in a future update or DLC. Much props and again im enjoying this game greatly as I learn and master it.			"

												Fantastic game.  A wonderful game for fantasy turn-based strategy gamers.  A rich fantasy world on the strategy map, plus a rich turn-based tactical combat.  It has a feeling of high quality throughout.  As I write this it is version 1.704 with two expansions, so there has been a lot of polishing.  There is sufficient richness to keep it totally aborbing at both the strategic map and tactical map levels.  I always get the ""I want to take one more turn"" feeling from this game.  It's like living in a rich fantasy world of the imagination.  I like this type of game more than the strategic map only games such as Fallen Enchantress, Sorcerer King, or Endless Legend.  I respect those games, but I find I spend my time playing this one.  A nice tutorial campaign and a searchable tome of knowledge make this game accessible to new  players such as myself.  A tip of the hat to the developer, Triumph Studios.  I'm won over as a fan of this game.			"

												Very immersive and addictive, lots of creatures and units, sustem of races mixed with colors and classes to have an unlimited set of personnalization, we can recreate lots of races with that.Only thing is I miss the tigrans and the undead are totally evil while the fey are just good for two of them(nymph and unicorn)Eventually, this game is one of my favorites and i really love this game.

												I really don't understand why I come back to play this game over and over.  I suspect it's because it's like Civilization in it's set up.  Anyway it's fun for a game every once and a while if you like strategy games.  Wastes lots of my time.  :)			"

												Great game for those who like turn based combat with a high fantasy setting.There are many races (human, goblin, elves, etc.) that you can combine with different classes (rouge, socerer, dreadnought, etc.) and then with a specialization (fire, water, creation, destruction, etc.).Each combination requires different strategies and plays very unique.I personally enjoyed playing as an air specialized frostling nacromancer (DLC), where I convert the whole land into ice field, turn enemies into ghouls, and march the land with an army of undead.  There more death the more powerful a nacromancer.The presentation of the game is very good and very polished.The single player campaign is a bit lacking, as the random map mode is where this game shines (similar to Civilization 5).  Unlike Civilization series, Age of Wonders 3 focus on combat in a tatical map.The tatical maps are very detailed and reflect the tiles of the strategic map that the units were on.Units have many abilities.  Player can also have hero units with RPG upgrade elements.There are only very basic diplomacy and empire building, but the battle is where this game produce the most enjoyment.The DLCs are also very wonderful and included new races to play that really expanded the experience of this game.If you like high fantasy settings (dragons, trolls, goblins, dwarves, elves, kights, magic and so on), then do give this game a try.

												I have been playing alot of RTS and 4X games lately. This one is actually my favorite. The campaign is rather challenging, but the random scenarios are great for having a more relaxed game. I especially love the unit diversity among the races, as well as the various special units you get access to for building capture, as well as summoned units based on class. The hero units are also well done with great variety. Not only would i recommend this game on sale as well as full price, but i would have been willing to pay $60 for it if i knew how good it was. Fortunately no one will have to.I have never played the earlier games in the series, but i will defintly throw money at a 4th Age of Wonders if it is anywhere near this good.			"

												Notes: not a 4x grognard, haven't played on highest settings.This is a great turn based 4x strategy game.  It has a good tippiness toward the end, minimizing the endgame grind. Good variation among the factions especially with the expansions.   The luck factor is annoying, but the rest of the modifiers are fine to good.  Really one of the best 4xes I've played.			"

												Just a rollicking good time with this game.  Just like its predecessor (Age of Wonders Shadow Magic), this game gets tactical combat right.  Lots and lots of ways to build out your troops/magic throwing hero.. lots of combinations of class and race, and the normal exploration and city building (members of the genre that are similar would be Heroes of MIght and Magic, King's Bounty.. ).The city building it what to expect.. but its the battles that make me come back for more and more and more.. And the random map generator, and all its options for size/number of players/options make the replayability endless.Just a fantastic game.. if you like turn based strategy.. buy it NOW.			"

												A very decent reboot that stays remarkably faithful to the original games and definitely has that AoW feeling - many of the units and mechanics are in fact the same as the Shadow Magic days. Veterans can certainly skip the tutorial - you've been here before.Great turn-based strategy that's as addictive and deep as the best of them, lovely visuals and an enjoyable fantasy world that is oddly convincing whilst not massively original.A must-buy for any Heroes of Might and Magic fans, and there's even plenty here for Civ fans, lovers of tactical turn-based combat and 4X strategy.One of the best blends of fantasy strategy out there. If you're tempted, i don't think you'll be disappointed			"

												If you're a fan of the Age of Wonders series you probably already own this. If you don't, what are you waiting for?It's good, don't worry!If you're completely new to this francise however, this choice is a more difficult one. This game is hexbased, turbased, fantasy, strategy game with rpg elements. If you didn't run aways screaming at those words, this game may be for you. The genre itself is a bit niche, but within it's genre, it's very good. It features:-  a very indepth combat system- quite deep city building (though no where near CIV5 standards)- Incredible addictive and timesinking gameplay (very high replayabillity)- Cool graphics- Unique classes (they differ a lot in terms of strategy and gameplay)- continuous updates (golden gates is already out, now we are waiting for the undead to arrive) On the downside however- Steep learningcurve- Difficult AI (which is simultaniously a good thing, the ai is pretty smart)- Uninteresting story (highfanasty qualms, order of quartidoudle, counsil of ziyrlotsofletters blahblah)- slow pacing (one lvl from a campaign will require mutiple hours if not a few days to complete.- the morality system feels iffy and doesn't add much.tl;dr: All in all I think it's a very good game if you're not scared away by long sessions, difficult AI and high fantasy drama "

												The end game is not very good due to a lack of diverse choice. There's only one or two end game unit available per game and because theyre strongest, the AI spams this strongest unit available so all you see after a certain point is armies of the same dude.What better strategy than to survive til late game and then spam shadows who each have a 80% damage reduction buff and just bulldoze everyone else?That said, the running around map explorations and leveling your heros and collecting treasures is pretty satisfying.The big big battles involving multiple full-stacked units is too, when you finally decide to stop adventuring and actually ending the game.Would I buy this base game at full price $30 again? Probably not, truth be told, but definitely on discount. And, with the DLCs for sure. The game is jarringly upfront about it being incomplete (smirks at you for only having the base game).I'm going to buy those DLCs now. Can't stand another sight of the cat and necromancers pictures knowing full well I can't play those (yet).			"

If you like those two games, I recommend you watch AoW3 gameplays and see if it is for your taste.+Beautiful world+Variety of races & monsters+awesome OST-Font size on box and tips are very small.-/+ The DLCs are too expensive, I bought all the package cause of Civ (in this one, you have the complete game experience after getting the DLCs).

												This game is a wonderful continuation for a long-time fan of Age of Wonders.  It polishes up what was lacking in the previous games while also bringing in welcome changes such as removing forced alignment from players and new spells.However, one of the most glaring issues with this game is that it suffers from you not buying the entire game.  While this isn't a severe problem for this game specifically compared to other games, it will not be as complete as older games.  There are not as much races (you can complete the race splash by buying DLC), not as much content, not as much pre-made scenarios, etc. than the previous games.  It feels like the game was intentionally cut up to serve the players the rest of the content with DLC.If you can live with the DLC, this is a fantastic game to buy.			"

												This game has become so much ""YESSSSSS!"".I considder AoW3, including it's DLCs ""Eternal Lord Expansion"" and ""Golden Realms Expansion"" a must-have for anyone who loves him some Strategy and tactics, mixed with a little bit of RPG.* The Main-Game without those DLCs is nice, but lacks content in comparison with the old AoW or AoW2. Not being bad itself, it's pretty bland. Technically: *Do your Main-Thing and win*.* The DLC: Golden Realms introduces some minor appetizers, giving you some features to play around with.* The DLC: Etermal Lords is, by far, among the best DLCs delivered for any game, if you'd ask me. Just for being able to play undead kitties makes this worthwhile.* The DLC:Dunno the name, is like ""Okay."". Rather a personal achievement for throwing out money, but still: Content is content.

												This game is great it has alot of cool fetures but hear are a few things i think would make this game even better:-More races, there are so many great fictional races you could have made optional in this game i hope to see more in future dlc. e.g you could make fish like creatures that could be the only race able to inhabit water tiles and a special unit could be cuthullu, mermaids (when touches a ship could ever fead or convert to your side unless a legend is present), you could also make this race weaker on land.-More detailed customisation, to be honest when i got to making my legend i got really disapointed as i was met by around about 3 face types and 3 clothing options for the human race as a male rouge. none of the faces even fit the charcter they all looked like middle aged men that spent their life in the pub, i wanted my guy to look like a young rouge with side swept hair who spent his time going inn to inn looking for some quick gold and hunted his own food.-More Diplomacy, when i made an aligence with an allies enemy i was no longer trusted and i could never win back that trust also it would be nice to convince each side to lay down their arms and be at peace or even make an alligence for the greater good.-Little things, you could make an option in game to send out a Job offer to legends letting you specify what you want (rouge, dreadnaught, warlord e.t.c.) this could cost more if you want, don't dispose of my spells if there is too much just make an extra page, Let the giant race expand and grow and provide more options for them and any other race you guys have done this to. Any way I had a great experience playing this game and it is now one of my favourite turn based game of all time. "

												Did you or do you love the Heroes Might and Magic games?!Did you or do you love the Disciples games?! (I have heard bade things about Ressurection so ignore that one!)Then you will LOVE this game! Do not fret so much on the people talking so negatively about this game.If you love long hours for one game (I have been playing the second campain mission for days now. Yea its that intense)building or taking over cities to widen your territory for more resources, and intense turn-based battles (or auto-battle), get this game! It has the large maps of Heroes, with the army formations of Disciples--- (6 whatevers per army including heroes and its not quantity like the 'zongz' or 'hordes' in Heroes, only one each unit (althought there can be 1,3, or 6 ""people"" in one unit formation)and instead of changing like they do in Disciples, they ""level up"" and get stronger.)--- while adding its own spin. You can make builders and settlers that make roads, cities, forts, and watchtowers. Its own spells and such.Like Heroes you have all kinds of spells you can research and use (although you do not have to build a mage guild). Unlike Heroes you do not ""go into"" a city, a panel just pops up and you select it. Although the city look does change over time. Sort of like a TW 2 Rome, where little houses spread out around it. So who really wants to read every little detail. You can go watch Youtube vidoes of actaul gameplay right? Games like these arnt for gamers who want a Ryse Rome kind of game. A salute my fellow, slowly take over every inch of the map and clear it out, plus build it all up how you want, gamers! Go Warcraft 1-3 and BFME games XDI will say, at first I regretted buying this. OMG why did I buy this when I can just play my Disciples II and have basically the same thing. HA! Discpiles is (while I have not played the new one from this year (2014..drool....) no where near as intense and LONG (again think Heroes!) as AoW. Granted it is limited. Each race has the exact same building, and each unit while looks, attributes and powers are different, each tier or class (Tier 1 Calvary or Tier 3 Archer) is comparribly the same. If you want a good, intense, in depth fighting game that you can or want to spend huge amount of time ------- (I have put in 17.5 hours as I post this, maybe 2 of which was on the first mission, the rest on the second campain mission AND I am only half way through the map....well the top level anyhow ;) I have barely done anything on the under level. OH I FORGOT! With builders or special units like the giant beetle you can 'dig; through certain walls and explore more, while more or less combining the whole under level....be careful you arnt the only one who can :P)-------- get this game!Even do like me and put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale.Hope this helped. Feel free to ask any questions to me!If you do not know what Heroes is OR Discplis. Go explore and enjoy:) Trust me. You will love it.			"

												This title reminds me of the Heros of Might and Magic series and has many similarities to it.  Fans of it will likely enjoy Age of Wonders as well.  It improves on the familiar formula with ideas from other strategy games such as cities which expand over time and generate income from resources withing their spheres of infulence.  Unlike Heroes you are able to estlablish new cities on the map as well as fortifications and road networks.  Armies made up completely of flying units are able to cross lakes and mountains and terraforming spells can improve your territory or ruin your enemy's, effecting the morale of cities, which have terrian preferences and dislikes depending on their racial characteristics.  A unified research system unlocks new spells, units, traits, abilities, etc.  Like heroes the map has an overworld and underworld providing difficult stategic oppertunities for surprise attacks and shortcuts.  Unlike Heros, multiple armies in adjactent hexes can participate in the same battle for epic scale combat and seige warfare.  Multiple unique army leaders can band together into a fighting unit along with expendable military units in groupings of up to six, and will fight alongside their troops in battle as cavalry units capable of both ranged and melee attacks as well as spells and special abilities.  Leaders also gain experience and can be improved with increased stats and other perks upon leveling up.  Familiar fantasy races compete in this setting such as Elves, Orcs, Draconians, Dwarves, and Undead, amoung others.  Two campains are available with the game as well as custom maps and multiplayer options.			"

												Similar to Civilisation games in some aspects, but not as dry. Tactical combat (can be skipped and auto battle instead), hero units, spellcasting, make this game great.I keep thinking I've burnt out but keep coming back for more. Eagerly awaiting more DLC or AoW4.			"

												I've been playing Age of Wonders since the first legendary title was released and I think this game honors the previous titles.  If you're a fan of the Age of Wonders series, this title will not disappoint!  Good story line, great music (some AoW classics reborn), and the graphics are very nice.  Overall, if you enjoy turn based strategy games, this is an excellent title to pick up.			"

												I love AoW3 but there is one thing I'd change if I could--the camera controls on the battle screen to rotate the view are backwards from all the other games I've played and there seems to be no way to tell the game to reverse it so it's caused me no end of frustration.  The option to reverse the mouse screen rotate would be awesome!			"

												I really thought this game was  letdown.  Sorry, Triumph, but what I liked about this game series was the epic-level wizardry, and you've totally dumbed it down.  It really all comes down to the downgrade from domain-level spell to city-level.  Now you cast the same spell over and over, only to have the compy players dispel it randomly around your empire.  The troops are all weaker, too.  Playing daconians?  No red dragons for you.  Your best unit is now... flyers.  Yay.  It's like they cut the best options out and then expect you to be happier with  the stupid bottom tier troops.  Oh, and your wizard (or whatever) is now just another hero.Maybe you'll get some of the old awesomeness back with an expansion or something, but right now, though, if you're looking for an epic sequel.  Look elsewhere.  This is decidedly NOT epic.			"

												Short Version: The game looks gorgeous, has tons of replayability with a solid battle AI, and some of the most fun tactial battles of any game I can think of.  If you want fantasy battles look no further.Longer Version: A lot of people compare this game to Fallen Enchantress or Civ, and I think that comparison does very little justice to any of the games involved.  All three games are 4X games in that you can explore, exploit, expand, and exterminate enemies, but have very different focuses.  In general, Civilization games thrive on the first three ""x""s but have awful, boring warfare.  Fallen Enchantress is well-rounded, with decent battles and interesting RPG mechanics, but ultimately leaves a lot of the exploitation to be desired.  AoW 3 would be at the extreme opposite Civ: the battles are great, and, nominally, so are the other x's, but there is very little to do with any resource except use it to eXterminate.  The good news is that battles are a lot of fun with dozens of well-balanced, interesting units and lots of great spells.			"

A great fantasy strategy gameAlthough I think this game doesn't fully capture the ""wonders"" part of the old Age of Wonders it's a great addition to the modern fantasy strategy genre. This is primarily a quibble on the look of the game based on versions 1 & 2. Particularly in the strategic map, I feel that the new version lacks on a certain visual feedback that the old ones had that made them look more woundrous and magical than the new version does. You may not agree with me on this, and that's fine, it really doesn't affect the gameplay.The hero creation is interesting and varied, and the hero that leads your army has a significant impact on gameplay as the units/spells available vary depending on your choices. There are interesting items you can get, including a variety of mounts. I still wish this part was a bit more fleshed out, but it's still enough to make that part of the game interesting.Large campaign maps take forever and a day to complete, which sounds great but I still have yet to finish one. I've spent very little time in the game's campaign, I usually just play random maps.			"

												To those who love games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, XCOM, etc..., I would highly recommend this game. It takes the core elements of great tactics style RPGs, and throws them inside a slightly simplified empire building game a la Civilization V.I can acknowledge that the strategic portion of the game lacks some of the depth that can be found in the most hardcore strategy games, but I do not feel this is a flaw. One of the greatest games ever devised, Chess, has only 6 unique pieces, and in its standard style of play, only allows for 1v1 competition. There is a delightfully simple elegance to the units and technologies available in AoWIII (which offer many more choices than Chess). Taken from a purely turn-based strategy game perspective, they would seem shallow compared to the game's peers, but in the context of a deep turn-based tactical RPG (with heroes levelling from 1-30, earning skill points to allocate each level, and spells to research, and gear to equip) it is plenty complex enough.My favorite thing about this game is how amazingly stable my multiplayer experience has been.  My first time launching online multiplayer, it checked my connectivity rating, and told me it was poor due to firewall settings. I clicked a link provided in-game, and in a totally crisp and not buggy fashion, minimized my client and sent me to the company's help page, wherein I was given the neccessary port to forward. I did so, had the game check again, and was good to go. A friend and I have long searched for a good co-operative tactical RPG experience. The best I have yet found was FFT: The Lion War for PSP. It's a shame that a hand-held game system has trumped PC for so long in this niche. XCOM lacks co-op campaign functionality, Eador is horribly buggy and unstable, and the others I've tried are all crumby. In AoWIII, I've found that harmonious combination of enjoyable gameplay and completely (and I mean 8 straight hours of addictive, no crashes or disconnections) stable multiplayer.Watch some videos of this game and decide if it suits your interests, but as for my opinion, I can give this one an A+.

												I think I need to write something to up vote this. It's an awesome war strategy game with a lot of options to customize your hero, and your armies. The battles can be small, or massive, and take place in a lot of well designed battlefields. The world map is randomized for custom games, but still has a lot of options to determine what the map will generally be like. The cities have a fairly basic tier upgrade system, but the game is definitely based on the warfare.			"

Loads of fun if you like / are looking for a slow / strategic game.It is most similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic series except this game offers more on most fronts, especially the ""manual"" battles are much more tactical, with loads of units with special abilities. And of course heroes which can be levelled up /& geared up to become increadibly powerfull.Add to that tons of researchable spells both for combat and for world effects / buffs and you get a game with amazing depth.

												The game I didn't know I was looking for. As a young man I loved Lords of Magic despite its many faults, and this game succeeds in delivering a fantasy strategy game with a good amount of turn-based tactical combat layered onto a fairly simple empire-management system.If I had to criticize, I'd say that defeating the campaigns relies a little too heavily on mass-produced cannon fodder than I'd like, as I prefer cruising with one super-army of elite troops and superior tactics to the war of attrition the AI plays for. This need is fulfilled by setting up a custom scenario and basically dungeon-crawling through the world.			"

												Where do I start...let me first say this game has definitely bkown away my expectations and what a turn based game should be. I have been a follower of the Heroes of Might and Magic series since the beginning. Developers at the Heroes camp need to take a page out of this book and use it. The biggest thing I like about this game is the option to ally with either a human or AI opponent and then play on whatever map you like. There are no restrictions to this at all. Just like in Civ games where all the options are open and you create the game for how you want to play. Same thing here. Being able to go around the map with your hero and its accompanied army just seeking out riches and enemy armies is so cool. Also your allies can travel with you and go into battle with you. First time I have ever seen that implemented into a game before. Juat imagine taking on a enemy faction along with your buddy online or hotseat taking on whatever came your way. Casting spells and supporting each other. This game does it right. I recommend to anyone this series of games. Plus two huge dlc addons available as well. Can't wait to take anothwr turn!			"

												If you like games like the Civilization series, or the Heroes of Might & Magic series, and are hankering for a new high-fantasy strategy game to play, do yourself a favor and check this game out! This was my first experience with the Age of Wonders series, I was looking through the Steam store for something new, saw it and decided to give it a go. I didn't expect much given the usual quality of today's games but man was I surprised!Here is my pros and cons list based on my experience playing the base game, I haven't bought the expansion packs yet but I definitely plan to.Pros : - Challenging gameplay that requires you to think ahead, as well as think quickly on your feet.- Good AI.- Wide variety of fantasy creatures to go up against, or enlist in your own army.- Active modding community on the Steam Workshop.- Beautiful visuals.- Large arsenal of spells, abilities, upgrades and equipment that make each Leader feel unique.- Nice soundtrack that does a good job of adding to the immersion.- A character creation system that offers a good deal of customization for this sort of game.- Boatloads of replayability.Cons : - Some units and abilities seem rather imbalanced, but nothing gamebreaking.- Challenge can sometimes ramp up drastically.- Cities could use a bit more diversity, while it is possible to have a city that is specialized in performing a certain role, I haven't yet found that to be necessary and as a result all my cities have pretty much had the same buildings. I think this could have been improved by making a tech-tree for cities so you would have to decide what you want that city's main purpose to be. But, since the game is focused more on armies and combat rather than city building, this isn't a huge deal.- Very few visual changes on your Leaders and Heroes in regard to their equipment, the only items that change your appearance are your mount and your weapon. This is more of a personal desire and not so much something the game did wrong,  it IS a strategy game after all and would require alot of effort to implement. but still, I was a bit let down when I looted a very awesome looking helmet and chest piece only to find that it didn't affect my appearance. Once again, not a huge deal though.			"

												Age of Wonders III is an incredibly fun, turn-based strategy game that is formed around its ""deep fantasy"" theme. Rather than progressing through a series of eras, as other popular turn-based, world-domination strategy games do, this game puts the player in charge of one of many fantasy races and it is the player's job to push their people to victory.One mechanical element that draws me to this game, and one that is fairly unique to AoW3 (as far as I know), is the tactical hex-based combat. Unlike the Civilization series (which I also recommend), AoW3 allows players to take direct control over their armies when they are engaged in combat with enemy forces. Instead of forcing an odds-based animation and resolution of the battle (which is still an option, but not required), the game allows players to enter into a battlefield that is generated based on the terrain types of the embattled hex as well as its special features and those of the neighboring hexes. This provides tactically savvy players the opportunity to achieve satisfying victories in the face of almost guaranteed auto-resolve defeats.Another element of the game that I find quite satisfying is the ability to create your own hero character who serves as your civilization's leader for the duration of the game. There are a significant number of races, classes, and looks based on each of those that players can choose from, and there's even a rudimentary skill selection process for your leader that can help players who want to lead their race by pursuing a certain playstyle during their game. These leader units not only represent your race in diplomatic encounters with other players, but they also serve as actual, usable units on the battlefield that can lead players' forces to gallant victories (or crushing defeats).The base game has a lot to explore for new players, so definitely start with that if you're just trying the game out. Once you get the hang of it, and also develop an inevitable liking for the game, I would highly recommend the DLC that introduces new races and campaigns. This DLC adds to the already numerous choices for leaders, races, and playstyles, and should give players who like the campaigns many more hours of content to play through.			"

												I must say that my first impression when playing this game was not very positive. It seemed to me that the focus was too heavily on battles, and that the game was forcing every turn the player to do some actions dictated by the progress of the cities, rise of new heroes, etc. I felt a general lack of freedom. But playing again after some time (and a couple of expansions) I have changed my mind. This is a very well done game, and I tend to agree with someone saying that this is one of the best modern successors of the venerable Master of Magic. Extremely good game for those who love fantasy turn-based strategy, with a large variety of troops and spells, and challenging AI players.			"

Pro's:- Lot's and lot's of different customisations, giving you the opportunity to enjoy a different game each game- Campaign is fun, but the multiplayer works like a treat, different settings give you an option to view what your allies are doing, or just kick your friends asses with your army of the allmighty baby shock serpents- Simultanious turns are fun if you play with friends- A load of different units and unit types, the classes work a treat giving you even more options to play the game you want to play- scenario's, random maps, the works for a turn-based strat. Cons: - It can be a bit frustrating to be attacked by 5 archon titans- Or bone dragons- Or queen spidersBut hey, it's a fun strategy game, a multiplayer game can be done in about 60 turns if you're playing mellow. You can customize a lot, meaning you can set up your random map for a fast game, or slow.And it has baby shock serpents.Best AOW in my opinion, 8/10			"

Moving armies around the map can be a bit tedious but overall it is very fun if you have a few friends.Pros:+ Fun to play with friends+ Alot of races + customizable heroes+ Independants and AI are actually tough+ Fun scenarios+ Easy to connect MultiplayerCons:- Game length is very long- Auto combat is still a bit off- Wish there was a faster way to move troops around / help your allies			"

												I really like this game. I like how you can customize your leaders looks and magic ability, even the background image behind them. It has a really beautiful musical score and the maps are gorgeous. IMO it is a lot better than Endless Legend, which always felt a bit weird and alien to me. If you like fantasy empire games, you should definately give it a solid play.			"

												Classic 4X gameplay, with a stronger focus on combat that diplomacy and a stronger focus on unit managment as opposed to city/kingdom managment. The tur-based strategic batles allow you to spectate and interact with the units in a way most other 4X games lack. The customization in Class and Race allow for hightened replayability and a greater sence of diversity amoung the units and opponents. I would highly reccomend this game for anyone who enjoys 4X and strategy games. Graphics are colorful and detailed as well, and the music/sound is good enough. 9/10			"

												With the strategic and tactical mix, AoW3 has that Master of Magic feel while retaining the familiarity of the AoW 1 and 2 games.  I have enjoyed this game very much.  The classes seem to be very similar and playing them doesn't really require a different strategy for each.  Fewer balanced classes that played differently would have been more enjoyable but very few games have ever gotten that formula right.  I also find that occasionally I can win a difficult battle with autocombat ex:  (two six man armies each led by a hero against four fliers and a hunter in a city) that I couldn't win manually and vice versa ex: (I beat an eight man army lead by a hero with three elven archers).  Not sure what that's about but if I redo a battle a bunch of times and get my butt kicked I can occasionally win it with autocombat.  Also a little frustrating when my hero doesn't get disjunction to research during a random game but oh well makes for a challenge.			"

												This is truely an amazing game and a great entry into the age of wonders series. It is very well done all-around with great replayablity. It makes not having a girlfriend totally okay :)The only downside is I had to apologize to my family. Turns out they were sleeping the first time I had Chaos rift cast on me by another player.* No matter how hard you try to explain that the spell is op as all get-out people still think there is no justification for yelling so loudly in anger that you woke them up at 2:00 AM :(10/10 would totally take this game too seriously again and keep playing. *No computer equipment was damaged or broken at the raging at this op spell, surprisingly.

												The game has great promise and is initially fun to play.  The campaigns are kind of fun.  There is no real story behind the campaigns, from what I've seen so far.  The graphics are very good.  However, after several games played through to the end, you will find that they all wind up coming down to the same thing, a bunch of the same types of units slugging it out.The game only has about 2 dozen playable units, but they changed the names slightly (depending on race) and changed the appearance.  Example Dwarf Manticore Rider, Draconian Manticore Rider, Elven Manticore Rider.  They all have almost the same stats, but look different.  The racial differences are too insignificant to make a difference.  The spells and traits, although there are many types, are for the most part not enough to make up for the overwhelming power of Tier IV and above units.  You can use different battle tactics, such as flanking, and get a bonus on your attack.  Currently, wounded units fight at full strength.  Heroes are limited in how many can be acquired in the game, but you can have as many other units as you can afford.The balance is horrible overall.Instead of creating a complex version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, they made it so it is just a bunch of Rocks fighting it out.  The rocks all look different!  But they are still Rocks.Every high quality strategic and tactical game out there is designed in such a way that the units/skills/abilities/spells are either complimentary to one another, or a counter to one another.  These high quality games have tremendous depth because there are so many options in how the game is played.  They understand that there should be strengths and weaknesses to almost all choices.  If, for example, I rushed in with a bunch of tanks I would get chewed up by the anti-tank helocoptors, which are themselves weak to anti-air units, etc.  AOW III does not really do this.  Instead it is a slug fest between the hardest hitting, high hitpoint units.  Basically, it's just a bunch of tanks fighting it out.  Booorrring.I really want to like this game...*Update* I'm still playing it, bugs and all.  Until they balance the game better and offer more depth, I will continue to give it a thumbs down.			"

I'll be looking forward to the next addition. If you buy the expansion packs for the other races all of those races and new units and things gets added into the orginal AGW3 game when you play it.

												Age of Wonders 3 is an excellent 4X strategy game that is hard to learn, but rewarding to play. Compared to other games of it's type, AW3 offers a much deeper combat system and a wide veriety of strategies and compositions. If you have a lot of spare time, love/are interested in grand strategy titles, and/or like the themes of traitional medieval fantacy, I would highly reccomend this game.Pros:- Excellent turn based combat system that favors strategy over raw stats- Races and Classes feel unique to play and favor sometimes wildly different strategies. Lots of options.- Optional, yet deep, character customization.- The world is fun to explore - and very rewarding. There's always something productive to do.- DLC adds game changing elements that are worth investing in if you enjoy the base game- You CAN add more races into your empire, leading to even more wild compositions- Campaign mode offers a more flavorful world, and each unit has a flavorful story tied to it. World is more immersive.Cons:- Some race/class combinations are much weaker than others.- Tutorial is very bad - game is hard to learn, and harder to understand.- Campaign maps favor rush tatics over late game strategies. Also, unfathomable gaps exist between difficult levels (easy being almost braindead, and normal being infuriatingly hard.)- Barebones diplomacy system. - The base game its all about domination. Mre options are availible with DLC, but I would advise rushing to buy something if you don't know whether or not its right for you.- Cities lack much thematic diversity, are like the diplomatic system are more barebone.- No ""just one more turn"" button.I give Age of Wonders 3 a 9/10. Its pros outweigh almost all of its cons, and with a more in depth diplomacy system and optional post victory gameplay, it could easily have earned a 10/10 from me.			"

												The scenarios take a long time to accomplish and it feels like a grind for the majority of it.  Most of the research that the game has you do has little to no effect on the outcomes.  The game feels somewhat like a demo.  A lot of the flavor art features races that are only available after the expansion is purchased.  I can't say I didn't have some fun and if sitting down for a three hour scenario is your cup of tea, game on.  Otherwise, maybe find something else.			"

												Age of Wonders III is in many ways the true successor to Master of Magic. The overworld and spell research sections are very good, with plenty of options for replayability and difficult choices. But where the game really shines is in the tactical battles. The wide variety of units and abilities ensures that there is always a new factor to force you to change your pattern. The is also a multiplayer scene, if after you've finished the (extensive!) single-player campaigns and want to face some real challenges!Last, the sound design and art are top-notch. Those sorts of things are easy to overlook, but they can really make a difference!			"

												I've always enjoyed the AoW series, having spent enormous amounts of time playing and crafting maps in the previous versions. Alongside with HoMM, AoW made a definite game where exploring the map, killing monsters and conquering cities was greatly enjoyable. The variance between races and magic (somewhat) allowed for different playstyles. In AoW3, this all seems to be expanded to greater degree, with even more variance to the races due to the different hero types.The only thing that I've always felt was lacking was magic. Compared to an another old time classic, Masters of Magic, where you could raise volcanoes, corrupt the land and blight enemy cities, the spell selection seems limited and rather straightforward. Of course, in MoM, one could actually select their wizards starting spell-books from different domains of magic and even expand their library through hard challenges. But besides this single small thing, the series still seems enjoyable.While writing this, I've played the main game and have continued somewhat into the first expansion, where I'm currently stuck. I loathe to downgrade the difficulty from hard, so lets see how long this takes.			"

												Age of Wonders III has combined the grid-based exploration systems of most cultural building games (such as Civilization, and Age of Empires), and combines it with the turn-based combat systems of a generic Tactical RPG. The only real gripe I HAVE with the game is the inability to construct things like farms and mines, so if you spawn in an area that doesn't have any nearby, you'll likely be screwed upon starting. Other than that, the game is fantastic. Not to mention that the musical score is such a delight.			"

Posted: April 5, 2014
												Age of Wonders III is utterly amazing.My view may be skewed due to putting 100+ hours into the original, but for newcomers to the series I highly recommend this title. The game play is 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) much like the Civilization or Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is set in a high fantasy world ripe with monstrous creatures, dungeons and undead armies. When playing a map (either a scenario, the campaign, or a randomly generated map) you start with a leader unit who, in scenarios or random maps, you create yourself and usually a small army based on one of the five races that you can choose with a city or a city building unit to start your empire. Your leader can level up as they defeat enemies with your armies and gain points to put into unique abilities based on their class and their offensive and defensive statistics. These abilities will help bolster the armies that they lead and push you ever closer to victory. The infantry units you command also gain experience and levels up to four but their abilities and stats are predetermined. Also based on the previously mentioned class and the actions you take to solidify an alignment, either good or evil, are the spells that you research along the way which is reminiscent of technology from the Civ franchise.Along your journey you will more than likely run across heroes that will offer to join you, these characters are much like your leader, they level up the same, they gain abilities based on their class, and they are meant to lead armies. The big difference being that if you lose one of these heroes they are gone, much like other units in your army. Your leader will respawn at your throne city, assuming it's still standing, after a few turns but their friends will not. This makes the battles intense and the losses devastating. The battles are turn based on a hex map based on whatever landscape you're occupying and these maps are gorgeous. They really give you a look at the landscapes that your troops are marching through.The class system mentioned above is a change to the series that after experiencing I can say is welcome. There are very distinct ways that each class works from the technology based, steam punkesque Dreadnaught to the classic magic juggernaut that is the Sorcerer. The Theocrat leads through belief and divine retribution with their crusaders, leading holy wars against their heretical enemies while the Rogue leads through deception, riots, and stealth. The Archdruid taps into the power of nature, summoning animal companions and nature elementals to their side while the Warlord rampages their armies with limited use of magic, ruling through blood, and battle.  Overall the game is a very unique and very fun experience. The soundtrack is breathtakingly beautiful with a few songs being a throwback to the original. Clearly I don't write reviews for a living (I know. ""Too many commas."" ""Where's the sentence structure?"") but I feel like if I were to Age of Wonders would get a 5/5, 10/10, or 100/100. The only gripe I could make is the lack of a few races from the previous games but that's nothing that an expansion or two won't fix. That, and the fact that I can't buy the collectors edition of the game. But life goes on. I'll be spending hours of mine in the Age of Wonders.			"

												I don't see what all the griping is about.  This is a top notch game!  I have loved AOW since my buddy got in on the beta test when Epic was just a 2bit company.  AOW III could have more in it from Wizards Throne (AOW II) , but I am trusting Triumph to get a good amount of DL content.  This game kills HOMM, and Fallen Enchantress.  It was the first game to utilize the Underworld, and Environmental spell effects.  While they have borrowed a little too much from HOMM and dumb down some of the dimensional combat, it's still a great game, could it be better?  Yes, but it is worth the money.  A Huge map will keep you busy for a few days.  The longer you play, in my estimate the more you will get into the mechanics and the depth of the game.  You can choose your own destiny Evil or Good, it all depends on whether you want to slaughter a bunch of friendly nymphs and ferries or make peace with everyone.  Graphics are good, not great but the game play makes up for everything.  If you enjoy HOMM (Hero's of Might and Magic) or Fallen Enchantress then get this game.  You won't regret it.			"

The world view is exactly as I remember it (With amazing fantasy visuals) the tactical battles are greatly improved with just about every unit given some utility beyond the obvious.Hopefully there will be a few expansions as the game does need better progression options for heroes and a few more races (I remember the original having far more).

												Great throw back to the original but with many new twists. Hard mode is truly hard. Each race is unique and each class is unique. Combine that with the many neutral monsters throughout the world map and you have a game with more enemy variety than most MMOs. The campaign is dynamic compared to most modern strategy games. Sadly it is not as dynamic as the original game, either way they do a pretty good job. The storyline itself is unique and well narrated. All in all AOW III is by far one of the best games in its genre. The only criticism I have is with the genre itself and that is games and the campaign take a long time. Excellent game.

												I love this game, the units are great, sub factions are larger than in other games (Kinda like the city states in civ) You get to have a hero that you can fully level and customize. Explore dungeons for rewards and play multiplayer with friends.Fully customize your race.Great graphics.Terrain makes a HUGE differance depending on the modifiers of your hero and units.The manual combat is very fun and interactive. (Turn based also)One thing to note, the AI is very easy even on the hardest difficulty level. If you want a challenge play with your friends or online with other people. I do hope the devs make the AI harder in the future.			"

												I am partway through my fist co-op game with my g/f (9 hour straight play session...), and I am hooked. Its my first foray into 'age of wonders', but its pretty easy to figure out whats what if you are familiar with Civ (the UI is very similar). I like the option to simulate battles or play them out, it lets our game move along at a nice pace for the little not-so-important battles against misc defenders, but lets you have epic battles played out manually when it matters. There are a ton of different (awesome) creatures that can make up your army, and I get a great kick out of attacking someone with my army of snakes, spiders, dire pengiuns and an ogre :)All in all, highly enjoyable.

												This game is flat out amazing. Played it with a couple friend and i would have to say multiplayer is completely flawless from what i saw whilst playing the game. The same can be said about solo player. 8/10. I bought it on sale but if I would've known how great this game was i would have bought it full price no problem.I recommend this game to anyone who likes playing turn based strategy games or just any form of strategy game.This game had me constantly asking myself for one for turn then I will close the game but I just couldn't. It is addictive to a scale in which I would play this for a couple hours nonstop and not notice how much time had even gone past.I also have to say I love the local clock situated in the bottom left.

There is many cutomization options for how you build your heroes, the randomly generated maps add LOTS of replayability to the game. The only lacking feature is Diplomacy is not fleshed out as I would hope.

												Gameplay has me totally hooked.Graphics are pretty. The animations are really beautifully done and I love how each race/hero combination feels totally different. Sound is good. Music is a bit shallow but theres mods to add more music in.Character development is good. Civilization building is deep enough but this is a combat game mainly. That said there are many ways to win and you can adjust the winning conditions to your liking such as allied victory etc, it doesn't have to be to the death.The story mode seems like a lot of fun and theres many hours of content there. I enjoyed what I played of it, though I quickly went on to the random map generator which is absolutely fantastic! You can customise so many things in the game and the character creator is wonderful to play with.Theres plenty of mods to play about with on the workshop to improve things further.Basically all there is to say. Awesome sauce game <3 Highly recommend it.(I bought the xpacs too, so I can't speak for vanilla alone)			"

												This game is a true strategy game, a wonder that combines hex-based strategy with city managment and the growing of heros. The game has a good campaign, although the multiplayer and the skirmishes are better. It also features leader creation, so you can build multiple leaders from any of the playable races in the game.The game also features a class system, which with regards to your heros, means they get skills based on their class. With regards to your leader, they also get skills, but this also determines what types of units you can build.The game has some seriousness to it, be it the evil necromancers, wanting to bring the world to the apocolypse, with the help of undead dragons, reapers, and fallen angels, to the holy theocrats who want to bring peace to the world. The game also has some sillyness to it, tameing fairies and dire penguins, and other ridiculous creatures.I would truly recommend this game, it is sure to bring you hours of fun, both by yourself and with your friends!

												A combination of 4X and a hex based tactics game. This game focuses on fantasty style combat. It is good for people who like to play warmongers in games like civ.Pros:Customization. Do you want to play tree hugging dwarves? Why not? An evil elf cleric. Sure.Battlefield tactics. When armies meet, turns into a turn based tactics game.Simplified magnagment. No tax rates to worry about. City management is important, but not nearly as time intensive as in Civ games.Game options. Want your heroes to be come back if they die? (as long as you win the combat) there is an option for that. Hate underground? Turn it off. Lots of monsters? No monsters? Everyone starts with a large pile of gold, a well developed city, and a huge army? okCreate your own leaders.Cons:Campaigns are boring. 400 hours in and I still haven't bothered to beat them all.A bit of a learning curve. It takes a bit to learn the game. There are lots of units and roaming monsters can get quite powerful if you never destroy thier dens.This game ruined a lot of other 4X games for me. Whenever I start playing those, I always come back to this one. "

												For all of you Civilization and Heroes of Might & Magic fans (full disclosure, I used to be a fan of both), this is your game.  I went back and played both HOMM3 and 5, as well as Civ V for comparison.  There is none.  You will never play either again because Age of Wonders III eclipses them by a significant amount.  In every area.  I will go into detail.Age of Wonders III (AOWIII) is a turn-based empire builder with turn-based combat.  Think a total war game (in terms of empire building) but with turn-based RPG combat (rather than real-time combat).  You have heros and gain experience based on your combat success.  This is how your units also level up and get stronger.  AOWIII features the use of magic, items for your heros and the development of your cities.This game is absolutely incredible!  There is a ton of depth and significant replay value.  There are a bunch of different races (all with their own special abilities and shortcomings, Human, High Elf, Draconian, Dwarf, etc.) as well as classes of hero (Sorcerer, Warlord, Theocrat, etc.).  Terrain is hugely important as is morale.  You must research spells, build units or buildings in your cities, explore the world and use diplomacy with those you encounter.  There are dungeons as well as special resource nodes to boost and aid your empire.  You can hire heros and summon monsters and animals.  Spells can be researched and there are a bunch of different paths you can take with these.  Do you want global spells that can affect the map or your towns, or should you focus on combat spells to obliterate your enemies during combat?  The beauty is you can do both.The turn-based combat is really amazing (similar to Endless Legend).  I have fought so many battles and each one is still unique.  Every time I think I have a handle on it, I get destroyed in a battle and must go back to the drawing board.  AOWIII is easy to play but difficult to master.  It can be challenging on the lowest levels and extremely difficult on the higher levels.  The combat is so deep because of the depth of different units and races, incredible variety of heroes in terms of both class and race, and the unique advantages/disadvantages that terrain poses.  Morale of units and heroes also plays a huge role.  Do not ignore this aspect!  Your heroes can ride or fly into battle on mythical creatures.  I highly recommend you give the game a try.  You will not be able to stop.  I keep telling myself, just one more turn...and then it's 2am.			"

												This game is amazing. I could go on about graphics and controls being smooth, but more importantly, the gmaeplay is brilliant. There are a lot of people complaining about things that are really more about their preference than the game's quality, so let me say this: you might want it to be more CoOp orientated than single player, or have tweeked combat mechanics, but ultimately this Civ-like/Fantasy/Totalwar-like game (for people who haven't played the ealier installments) is very well done, worked, and an all around 5* game.

												So, I played the original Age of Wonders and Age of Wonders 2, as well Shadow Magic, which was a stand alone expansion for Age of Wonders 2, so I was naturally quite interested when I heard Age of Wonders 3 was coming out. Somehow I'd managed to miss that it was even in production until about a month before it was released. Nevertheless, after starting to read about the game, I was a bit wary as some of the changes did not seem positive. However, being a fan of the series as a whole, I had to at least give it a try.So... is Age of Wonders 3 a good game? Well, your answer to that would no doubt be influenced by whether you have played any of the previous games in the series. Having played them, I would say, yes this is a good game but, relative to its time, the game is perhaps not as good as the previous titles in the series. For those of you who don't know, Age of Wonder is a fantasy turn-based strategy, with large amounts of magic, heroes and different races. In Age of Wonders, your leader was a hero and he or she travelled about with your army, gaining levels, exploring ancient ruins and so on. For Age of Wonders 2, your hero became a wizard who spent all his or her time sitting in their tower casting spells. With Age of Wonders 3, the system has gone back to that of the original Age of Wonders (i.e. your leader being an active participant in the world) so in this sense it has been an improvement from 2.Also the graphics are quite good and has a certain fantastical feel about it, I don't know if it's the shades and the hues, but it does feel quite vivid and rich. Also when you zoom out in the world screen, the view changes to a stylised map, as drawn on parchment, think the map of Middle-Earth, which I think looks really good.One of the biggest issues I had with the game prior to getting it was the massive cut the number of races, now there are only six: Goblins, Orcs, Dwarfs, Humans, Draconians and High Elves. This basicaly means many of the races from AoW2 are gone: Dark Elves/Wood Elves (although there is an in-game reason why they no longer exist, basically they kissed and made up and reformed as the High Elves), Frostlings, Halflings, etc. And yes, I would say the lack of races is quite noticable. I've played just 2 levels in one of the campaigns and during that time I've captured and held cities belonging to every single race in the game except for the dwarves. Considering I've only just started the third level, it seems odd that I've nearly played as every single race already. So, yes, I suppose there is certainly much less variation than there was.One of the ways that is suposed to reduce the imact of this lack of variation is by having small settlements belonging to 'minor races' which you can capture and then train units from other races. For example, I captured a fey settlement and was thus able to train various fey units, and construct buildings to improve them, as well as unlock different units that could be trained. I was actually quite surprised how much depth there was in this. You seem to be able to train 5-6 different units, and a fair number of buildings. I was expecting 2-3 different units at most. Nevertheless, they're still less in depth than a city from one of the main six races, and of course you can't build them.Combat is pretty much the same as the previous Age of Wonders games, and the additions with the new 3D engine are nice, for example having units consist of multiple men, the numbers of which go down as the unit gets injured. The system regarding magic spheres is a bit different to the previous titles in the series. Essentially, each hero has three different specialisations and if you're creating your own hero you can pick three from a list. These consist of 6 different areas of magic (water, fire, air, earth, creation and destruction), expander and explorer. Because of this, you can select a minimum of one area of magic and a maximum of three. This influences what you can research and what can subsequently use. When you do create a hero, you get quite a lot of customisation options in terms of apperance. You also have a range of different classes you can select for your hero: dreadnaught, druid, sorcerer, etc. Each of these gives you at least one unique building (which may be upgradable) and unique unit, however apart from that there seems to be little differences between the different classes. Being one class or the other doesn't influence the specialisations you can select for example, and these specialisations seem to have a much greater influence over your character than what class they are.The music in Age of Wonders 3 isn't anything special in my opinion. It's alright, but it's not amazingly noticable and there haven't been any songs I've particularly sat up and particularly enjoyed, compared to Age of Wonders 1 where there were a few songs I particularly liked, such as the March of the Halflings.People have reported having FPS issues, and I get them myself, but for me personally it's mostly fine, just a bit slow but certainly playable. The developers are aware of this and are currently working on fixing it.Also, I have to comend the voice acting in Age of Wonders 3. I've only played one campaign but the voice acting for the main character from whose point of view the stoy is told is actually very good. I admit this review hasn't been the most well structured, but to conclude, I think Age of Wonders 3 is a good game, perhaps a very good game but not an excellent game, and not as good as the previous games in the series and it does have some flaws. It is certainly is screaming out for some kind of expansion/DLC just to add a bit more variation and depth. Even with the minor races you can find and recruit, six major races does seem a bit few but I certainly don't regret buying it.			"

												Absolutely the best strategy turn based game ive ever played with my friends, the turns are fast and rapid as you dont need to wait long compared to other strategy turn based games. the combat is great in the form of flanking, blocking, tanking and casting spells even strategically planning where to have your heaviest units doing the most damage. as you can even join in on battles your ally start or yourself if they are next to the attacked target, forming some form of cooperative experience. the city management is alot of fun especially once you decide what your city will become for city, if you want it to solely focus on making troops or turning it into a city of mana to gain lots of mana to throw alot of spells is up to you as well as dependant on the leader you have. when it comes to the leader the customization is enough even if its not a whole lot but its enough to be satisfying to some extent, once it comes down to class and choosing specialization the real fun begins if you want to be a badass warmonger or a peace loving druid even a villainous necromancer its up to you. i really recommend playing this with friends as it will nearly ensure endless of fun.

												LIkes:* Unit-by-unit control on an overworld and battle map.  The number of units you manage throughout a single game does not become unwieldy either.* Flexible spell casting system, which can often turn the tides of a battle (or war); in your favor or your opponent's.* Extensive and challenging (in hard difficulty) singleplayer campaigns.* The euphoria when you defeat a numerically or qualitatively superior force through tactics and wit.* Multiple different races and classes, each of which is easy to pick up, but hard to master.Neutral:* City building and resource management is vital, but lacks much in terms of customization.  After you stuff every possible building in a single city, you repeat for other cities.* Research (spells and bonuses) is a nice system (you are unlikely to research everything in a single game), but opaque in terms of what unlocks what.Dislikes:* Multiplayer generally requires auto-combat to go at a reasonable pace (combat holds a global lock on the game state).* Lower tier units become worthless quickly (except, to some extent, archers).  This generally leads to monolithic army compositions later in the game.* Spell disjunction, especially in games with many players, is somewhat annoying; and constantly hampers your ability to do much with spellcasting besides re-casting disjuncted spells.

												Fast paced turn-based strategy game, more fight oriented than other games in genre. There's lots of ways to play the game, with several races, different neutral creatures/cities, lots of spells available, etc. The maps are also pretty nice, with lots of variety, its fun to try to explore it and see what you can find!

												Age of wonders 3 is another installment into the age of wonder series, a fantasy, 4X game with hex grid-turn based combat.Now, normally when i write these reviews, i'd go into depth about the plot or the world or both. But, considering that i spent a significant amount of time playing against AI and some friends in multiplayer, and avoided the single player aspect of it all together, i cannot give you a decent summery beyond saying that the common wealth, a joint group of races, have taken over a large section of the world, there is a court of elves who have not joined, and in the DLC, you can explore new lands with new races, and play as a cold blooded necromancer. Age of wonders functions like any other 4X game to an extent, you are placed on a randomly generated world (customised to your tastes, with a rather extensive range of options) as your chosen hero. Each hero is of a different race, class and has different abilities, each one drastically effecting how your nation will function. You can also make your own custom hero as well. I ended up making a necromancer dark elf called thul'duarn the shadebane, a master of destruction magic and expanding. Your race effects what kinds of units you can make, what type of areas your people like to settle in and what they can build inside cities, it also effects what things increase and decrease your moral. Each city has moral, depending on a number of factors, high moral is good and can lead to festivals, increased production and free money, low moral can lead to rioting and other bad things. Your class determines what kind of spells you can use, the powers your specific hero unit can use and what special units and buildings you can make. your chosen abilities will also determine your spells, unique units and so on.From there, you build up your city, but unlike other 4X games, there is a heavy insentive to go exploring with large armies, because, all around the world there are dungeons, minor factions and free loot to pick up. The dungeons, once cleared, grant bonuses to any city that has it in its borders, the minor factions can be brought into your empire by either doing a few easy quests for them, or just crushing their city with your forces. There are also random map wide events that occur, such as the penguin king and his army of penguins.Like most 4X games you do need to research new tech, you do this with knowledge and mana, though, you can also research new spells for your hero to use. If your hero is taking place in a battle, they can cast it at normal cost, if they are not, you can pay double the mana in order to use it. These spells range anywhere from a simple fireball, to a mass raise army spell, allowing you to summon literally limitless units until the battle is over.Then there is alignment, every character starts off as neutral unless they have taken a specific specialization. From there, you can go evil or good, depending on minor choices you make in game. However, there is no reason to be evil, as it drastically decreases the moral of your people if you go too far down that road, and other nations will outright hate you for it. But on the flip side, there is only a minor penalty for declaring war, so you can happily be the nicest warmonger you want without fear.The main ways to win the game are diplomatically (have everyone agree to become your sworn ally), or via war (kill all the things to win).  Naturally, i went for war every time, because otherwise there is no way to win against human opponents unless they surrender. There is no third or forth option, like a religious victory or a science victory.At the end of the day, Age of Wonders 3 is a 4X game for warmongers, there is literally no better way to win than to swarm your enemies with units, which can get extremely boring after a while, even if the combat is very good. The moral system is nice, but there is one issue, the necromancer class. You see, necromancer controlled cities that have been turned undead are not effected by moral what so ever, meaning they don't have bonuses or penalties to anything, they are just very good at pumping out more undead. Combine this with the fact the necromancer class has access to extremely powerful units in early, mid and late game, and the fact that they have some of the best spells in the game, really breaks it. There is nothing really to concern yourself with in terms of minor details like food and your alignment either, since you are a necromancer.I found the game very fun at first, but after a few matches i really grew tired of the process and found it far too easy, even on harder settings. Its not as deep as some 4X fans might be looking for and its too shallow for new people to be able to experience all the aspects of a 4X game. The only thing i can praise is the soundtrack, just, the pieces vary in quality, alot of them are solidly ok, some bland as paste, others really enjoyable. It makes for good background for a tabletop rpg, but thats it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but i wouldn't tell them to avoid it either, if i could give an ok rating, i would, but thats not possible sadly.I will tell a little story of how my necromancer won his first campaign, if only because it might help you understand how the game goes. So, off in the corner of the large map, my undead city rose from the earth and proceeded to declare the location chosen as ""fort bosturd"". Right outside my city was a hero, offering to be hired for a handful of coins, despite the fact he was a better necromancer than me. i split my armies up and roamed around the country, doing my necromancer thing, until i encountered a lovely group of faries, instead of running in terror, they greated me nicely and offered to become my allies if i killed a giant, two turns later, i had a giant corpse following me and a new ally. after a bit i turned them into part of my kingdom, and my first act as a new ruler was to convert their city into an undead one...without realizing they can't make the facilities that allow undead cities to grow. the city had a population of zero. i gifted it to my general, he seemed pleased.Jump forward about fifty turns and i had conquered about one third of the map, thanks to my amazing charisma, gleaming repulation as a merciful ruler and the massive undead horde that mindlessly agreed with me. i ran into another nation, ran by a goblin rogue called (insert ♥♥♥♥♥♥ goblin name here) the pretty. Naturally, she was smitten with me, a rotting corpse man, and we became diplomatic friends. I then ignored her and went to capture a city on my borders with my armies, which was a tougher nut to crack than i expected, losing a good number of troops. But i knew next turn i'd have it, until the goblin swooped in, stole the city from underneath me, then told me to ♥♥♥♥ off out of her lands within the next turn. my units all moved out, except for one, whom she destroyed and declared war on me. My armies were rather spread out, but i soon sorted that out, and just as i was about to murder her, she offered peace, and joined my empire, giving me a boost to peace and earning me the good alignment reward.I spread death and plague about for another fifty turns, everyone loving me as i turned them into walking corpses, when the penguin king event happened. in a few turns, i had lost two cities to penguins and was fighting off hordes of them. On that day i swore vengence against the penguin king and all his snowy followers, taking back my cities and cursing how far i had fallen behind in my conquests because of the delay. when i returned to the front, i met evil jesus. the guy who had won the true evil alignment reward, naturally, we did not get on very well, he was a theocrat, and his units could hit mine like trucks. but before he got the chance to, he surrendered to the other AI player. whom swore himself to me after i gifted him two really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cities. and that was how i won.

												As fan of the Series since AoW1 the reader of this positive review might think, that I'd just be a good fanboy to a well made series. However after being frustreted with 2 other spinoff of Roundbased Game Series, AoW3 was a very positive surprise for me!Other than in those mentioned other ""improved"" game experiences, the developers took to heart the initial strengths of the game, and preserved them, while adding new concepts like the neutral cities and the commander classes.And so you can be pretty sure what to get: a solid Age of Wonders experience with various cool new Ideas built in.There are a few minor things I'm not too happy about.For once the actual number of neutral cities is rather low (4, I believe). When I first met those new type of cities, I imagined them being a core concept of the game, with having 8, or even a dozen of them, seeing as the count of playable races shrinked to 6 . I thought the big diversity of units we know from the predecessors just wandered off into neutrality.So I was kind of depressed to see that you mainly got those 4 neutral cities, and the positive ""first contact""-experience was just something for the first few maps.Later on however, I realized why the race count went down like that:The race you play is entwined with the class you choose, giving you certain racial units with custom skins, which do have some of the racial benefits, but are actually a boon from your class.This makes the effort to create an ingame race exponentialy as high as in the predecessors, and because of that, I can very well understand the seemingly low number of races.On the positive side however, it adds diversity to the game, since the playstyle is not only about racial pick and magical spheres anymore, but adds a third layer of personalisation through the classes.There are some other minor setbacks from the original series in my point of view: The number of buildings on the map to recruit neutral units has been reduced to 1 (tavern); There are randomized heroes with basic class startups to get, instead of the heroes from AoW2, which kind of grow on to you because of their funny descriptions, and their prepicked own advantages; And also the later stages of the campaign become incredibly hero-dependant due to the leveling commander-heroes and the neutral heroes you transfer from map to map.But enough nitpicking.If you enjoyed the predecessors or are generaly into well-balanced tactical round-based game experiences.. make sure to get this one! The classes and races are very well designed, and the campaigns are bit straightforward storywise, but still diversified and interesting. The few experiences I made with online gaming so far were positive as well.			"

												It's an amazing game. It's just like Civ V, but in a fantasy world. All of the races and classes play distinctly differently. Ex: As a Necromancer, you don't have to worry about morale. Also, the combat is deep. You have flanking, elemental attacks and resistances, and attacks of opportunity. Completely worth the money.			"

												I enjoy AoW3 quite a bit, but the more I played it the more stale the AI got for me.  It's not that it's bad per se, just that it's predictable and usually very passive.  Usually they will turtle up in their cities if you are roaming nearby, even if they are a fair bit stronger than you.  This forces a lot of siege warfare, something that I don't think the game does very well.  You can't sit outside their gates and siege them down, you have to fight their forces full strength every time at their walls.  It gets tedious.  There are ways around this (happiness penalties/strategic spells mainly from Rogue) but the AI gets pretty significant boosts to its economy and happiness which makes it kind of moot.  That said, I still think the game is great.  The units are diverse, the asymmetrical balancing is rather good, and a lot of the racial specializations are nice to have.  Things that I'd like to see in the next iteration:- Smarter, less cheesy AI- Proper siege mechanics- More emphasis on skirmishes/raiding- More cultural/racial buildings and the addition of monuments/wonders- Option for fast move in combat with online play			"

												This is exactly the game I've been looking for!  It's very similar to Heroes of Might & Magic III and Civilization V.  The different game modes in Age of Wonders III is what makes this game better than Heroes or Civ games.  I prefer to play these kinds of games as a single player experience, or I play co-operatively with a friend (hot seat), so I haven't tried the online multiplayer features of this game.  I do highly recommend this game for the amazing and addictive single player game, especially if you're a fan of RPG fantasy, turn-based strategy, tactical combat, exploration, and empire building.

												This game is excellent. It has good graphics, good gameplay. It was the game I was looking for after being disappointed by Fallen Enchantress : Legendary Heroes.  The tactical combat in this game is much better with varying terrain and destroyable obstacles.  If you are a fan of Master of Magic, then you will probably like this.  I have just started the game so I have not seen all the features/limitations but overall it is a really good game and is actually worth full price, altho it is a bit expensive at 43$, but it is still worth it. The game is also integrated with Steam Workshop so user made maps are easily obtainable.edit: I also have come to find out that this game is gets regular updates that even bring in some new game mechanics and it also has to original expansion packs, not just dlc.  The same thing about updates and expansions can definatly not be said for Fallen Enchantress : Legendary Heroes.Edit: Despite looking much better than Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes, this game is better optimized and coded and doesn't suffer from any stuttering whatsoeverI can't stress how much better this game is over FE: LH.  These people did a much better job than those people.This game is always challenging and keeps getting better and more enjoyable for me as I become a better player. Also the user interface is great.			"

												I've played the entire franchise since it first came out, graphics and diversity just keep on improving! you have the choice of auto-combat or personally control your troops during an encounter, many different races with unique racial traits and units, it will take a bit to learn the game - recommend completing campaign before you launch multiplayer - you need to have a basic idea of all the troops, not only can you build your cities, and manage them you also have ""magic"" ready to cast once skills have been researched, - leads to a fairly complicated strategic game that will entertain hours on end :D 11/10 awesome game			"

												Age of Wonders III has come a long way since it's release. I'll be honest, I probably never had higher expectations on a computer game since I endorsed both Age of Wonders II and Shadow Magic and played them throughout an entire decade ... so after my first few games with AoW 3 I got a little disappointed. The game felt too fast, the starting race was much less significant than in the previous games and so felt the pick of the magical specilazations. Also I wasn't happy with some combat simplifications like flying units that suddenly had to land, the removal of friendly fire in ranged attacks etc ... Lucky for me (and for most other AoW 3 players I'd say) Triumph Studios wouldn't be Triumph Studios if they didn't listen to their community. With each patch more and more issues the playerbase initially had with the game got fixed with the result that now with it's free 1.5 patch (and the two expansions, if you bought them) the game is very convenient to play and feels very complete content-wise - just right for another ten years of gaming time ;)What you shouldn't expect AoW 3 to be is a civilization clone in a fantasy setting. While in civilization the main focus always has been on the empire building and management (let's say the strategical component) with Age of Wonders it's pretty much the opposite. The tactical combat is complex, demanding and offers tons of possibilities and while I personally wouldn't have sacrificed some of the mentioned combat characteristics of the previous games, Age of Wonders 3 can compensate their absence by introducing the guard mode and flanking system.

												I'm having a lot of fun with the game. It's one of those games that I got on sale but wouldn't have been upset if I paid full price. 	At first I was a little disappointed, there only seemed to be two campaigns. The high elves and the dwarfs, but you pick up other companions who help you and than you play their part of the campaign.   Example, first you play as a rouge Elf, but you quickly pick up a Draccon. When that part of the campaign is over it starts off as the Draccon in charge, but your high elf is still one of the leaders.	Again I was little disappointed because the first part of the campaign was long, so I figured it was over. Nope! As I said another character steps in and they become the primary champ.	I'm 15 hours plus on the second part of the campaign, I had to restart a few times. It can be a little trial by era but once you learn (and this goes into the actually strategy of the game) you know the most expensive units may not be your best.	Your main champs level up, but only to a certain point per campaign as well as your units but they don't carry over to the next stage of the campaign.  Basically your starting from scratch just your Champs keep their ability points and gear you might find. 	The AI isn't stupid, the game has a auto match feature for annoying little battles which I didn't think I would use. Even if your likely to defeated you can pull off a win if your in a castle and play smart, and use your units properly and cast the right spells. However there are times where you have no chance in hell of winning and your goal becomes to hurt and kill your attacker as much as possible, so you can send in another force and destroy them but having a major champ in the game can cause one big bust which means you have to restart or have a back up save. 	The storyline is rather weak but I'm okay with that, you get a big explanation in the start but your goal isn't always clear. Best advice is build up your money and mana before going to war if no one is attacking you. A lot of the towns you start will be useless besides for their money and mana benefits.  Basically you want to create a choke point and produce your troops from only a few locations. With that said some units take up money and mana every round so plan ahead. You can go through 20 turns with nothing really happening if you don't want it to.  "

												I enjoyed this game quite a bit but lost intrest fairly quickly.  This game can be quite fun and is a nice mixture of Civilization and Heros of Might and Magic. The battles are quite a bit more in debth then Heros of Might and Magic and I consider it the best part of the game.You can build new cities and the world strategy feels a bit closer to Civilization but unfortunetly not nearly as polished and strategic as the turn based army battles.I lost intrest in the game whenever I became succesful at the game. The moment you start to achieve a lead on your oppents via having the better armies you no longer have challenging wars with other armies which is the most polished part of the game. Instead it becomes a boring affair so I suggest you keep the diffculty settings as high as you can manage.Overall a very good game. "

It indeed needs some inital commitment to understand the core mechanics.Also DLC was great and well worth the money..and there is more to come;)If it continues to receive polish and components it could become a game that lasts for years...Highly Recommended from a demanding person;)			"

												I'm having a lot of fun with the game. It's one of those games that I got on sale but wouldn't have been upset if I paid full price. 	At first I was a little disappointed, there only seemed to be two campaigns. The high elves and the dwarfs, but you pick up other companions who help you and than you play their part of the campaign.   Example, first you play as a rouge Elf, but you quickly pick up a Draccon. When that part of the campaign is over it starts off as the Draccon in charge, but your high elf is still one of the leaders.	Again I was little disappointed because the first part of the campaign was long, so I figured it was over. Nope! As I said another character steps in and they become the primary champ.	I'm 15 hours plus on the second part of the campaign, I had to restart a few times. It can be a little trial by era but once you learn (and this goes into the actually strategy of the game) you know the most expensive units may not be your best.	Your main champs level up, but only to a certain point per campaign as well as your units but they don't carry over to the next stage of the campaign.  Basically your starting from scratch just your Champs keep their ability points and gear you might find. 	The AI isn't stupid, the game has a auto match feature for annoying little battles which I didn't think I would use. Even if your likely to defeated you can pull off a win if your in a castle and play smart, and use your units properly and cast the right spells. However there are times where you have no chance in hell of winning and your goal becomes to hurt and kill your attacker as much as possible, so you can send in another force and destroy them but having a major champ in the game can cause one big bust which means you have to restart or have a back up save. 	The storyline is rather weak but I'm okay with that, you get a big explanation in the start but your goal isn't always clear. Best advice is build up your money and mana before going to war if no one is attacking you. A lot of the towns you start will be useless besides for their money and mana benefits.  Basically you want to create a choke point and produce your troops from only a few locations. With that said some units take up money and mana every round so plan ahead. You can go through 20 turns with nothing really happening if you don't want it to.  "

												I enjoyed this game quite a bit but lost intrest fairly quickly.  This game can be quite fun and is a nice mixture of Civilization and Heros of Might and Magic. The battles are quite a bit more in debth then Heros of Might and Magic and I consider it the best part of the game.You can build new cities and the world strategy feels a bit closer to Civilization but unfortunetly not nearly as polished and strategic as the turn based army battles.I lost intrest in the game whenever I became succesful at the game. The moment you start to achieve a lead on your oppents via having the better armies you no longer have challenging wars with other armies which is the most polished part of the game. Instead it becomes a boring affair so I suggest you keep the diffculty settings as high as you can manage.Overall a very good game. "

												So far a very good turn-based strategy game and easy for someone who's more than a bit rusty at the genre to get into without much frustration. Some pros and cons so far:Pros: Easy to learn, tutorial pages are fairly informative and not intrusive if you hate having to go through tutorials that either are too long or too detailed...or the reverse. Fantasy setting is fairly straight forward (elves vs. orcs in basic campaign with human scum everywhere) but engaging storytelling and voice acting works wellTurn-based design is very comfortable if you've played this type of game in the pastCons:More than possible to wall yourself in a corner by accident (sort of comes with the turf though)Autosave will occasionally save right before a move you really wish you hadn't taken (so save often)YMV on this but I have found on occasion that I think I'm clicking to attack one troop and get another by accident. Not sure its a game issue or operator error (probably the latter)Anyway so far a 9/10 for me would get 1 more point if the fantasy elements were more exotic and interesting but otherwise quite easy and enjoyable to get into while being challenging to overcome. Will update if further play changes any details in this review (I'm only about 6 hours in to the initial campaign).			"

												Although this game will likely become 2014's hidden gem, Age of Wonders 3 is a pretty good take on turn-based strategy games.Regarding empire management, I've noticed that some have commented that when compared to games like Civilization, the empire management is more or less streamlined, and to me, building up my empire wasn't too difficult.I imagine that this is done to give a larger focus on the combat system, where the focus is no longer on the world map, but rather on a smaller tactical map where players command the party or parties they've formed and pit them against each other (either in open terrain or a siege depending on where the defending party is standing on at the time of the attack). I found it enjoyable that the Age of Wonders series brings you to this hex-based tactical view, though the previous games were heavily reliant on a random number generator, which can sometimes have your entire starting party be killed by 2 starting units.Age of Wonders 3 throws the random number generator out the window, meaning that defense/resistance actually reduces physical and magic damage. Additionally, line of sight and range penalties act as damage reductions, rather than giving ranged weapons a chance of missing entirely. Personally, i find that it's really nice that combat is no longer reliant on an in-game RNG, although I'm probably saying that because I've lost an entire party to 2 goblin militia units in Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic.And finally, the initial set-up (I probably should've started from here). Compared to Age of Wonders 1, it's somewhat simplified in the sense that you can't allocate your starting stats (I think this was done to prevent abuse, since you can pretty much start with 2-3 types of elemental melee damage), although this is more or less offset by the ability to choose your leader's race and class, which I felt is pretty fun to play around with.Overall, I find that Age of Wonders 3 is an awesome game for those who enjoy fantasy turn-based strategy games.

												Before writing this review, I'd looked at some of the negative reviews up and was, to say the least, surprised at some of the criticisms. With that in mind, I'd recommend anyone looking to buy this understand what Age of Wonders is.Despite having taken some obvious Civilization inspirations in the most recent title, Age of Wonders may be a TBS, but not a '4X' title, and never essentially has been. Diplomacy is merely functional, not a true gameplay concern. Exploitation, as far as the 4-X title is concerned, is fairly shallow. Expanding has simple mechanics behind it, leaving most of the game filling the ""Explore/Exterminate"" gap.Except that doesn't tell the story. This isn't a 4X title.This game stands up to games like Elemental: Fallen Enchantress, Warlock: Master of the Arcane, Eador: Master's of the Broken World and virtually any other fantasy Turn-Based Strategy title in the past 5, 6 or more years and presents in it a wholly more clean, professional, beautiful and, most importantly, long-lasting light. A genuine, long duo of campaigns that are story-driven and contain wide numbers of missions, an in-depth hero/leader customization options, wide variety of 'factions' by mix-and-matching Race and Class 'templates' to your own tastes and fantastic level design leaves this as a game that you can play, again and again and again again, and never grow tired, from what I've seen - much like the Age of Wonders of Old.Of course, with that in mind, if you don't want to spend $40 on a title in this genre, then I do have an alternative recommendation. Buy Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic, or even the Wizards Throne - even the ORIGINAL if you don't mind a more '90s' videogame in this genre, all of them on Steam. They're cheaper, and if you enjoy what those games has to offer you'll love this, as a very, very worthy revival.TO AGE OF WONDERS FANS:Age of Wonders 3 adds in some new mechanics that you may or may not find off-putting, but ultimately it takes a lot of the best features of Age of Wonders 1 and 2/Shadow Magic and combines them, while generally also creating a much more balanced game than the previous two - the unstoppable heroes/leaders and the sheer inability to fight high-tier creatures except with high-tier creatures of your own, most notably. ""Weaker"" units, as long as they're in number, have more relevance than they used to even later into the game, and the city progression, while not nearly as intuitive, has more specialization options and potential building plans than before. Combat is very similar to Shadow Magic or the Wizards Throne, but more in-depth, including additional mechanics such as how wall climbing is to work, certain non-wall terrain that can be damaged, and a PHENOMENAL ""flanking"" and ""defense"" system and a less-exploitable action/move system.I am not far enough into the game to have strong opinions on the campaign, particularly in terms of story; they've changed the themes somewhat from the earlier games, and I'm not convinced the character quality is as high, but it has some nice level design and, at the early levels, gives you a few legitimately different approaches to the same overall goal, and rewards a fair amount of exploration if you choose to take it - much like some of the better Shadow Magic campaign missions.A fantastic, fantastic game, and I urge people to give it, or even the older games in the series, a try. Even Shadow Magic, back about ten years ago, ran rings around the poorly-designed Elemental games of the modern age (Even LOOKED better, somehow) and had a way more satisying spell and combat system than, say, Warlock: Master of the Arcane.

												Great game.  I got this on release and have clocked a lot of hours on it, but I waited to recommend it.I waited because it had a few balance and playability issues otu of the box, which have been adressed with patches and the Dev's listening to the community.Pros- Good division between the classes and races, everyone is good at, and weak at, something.  This makes the choice meaningful.- A style which is both functional and cool looking.- Excellent in-game encyclopedia, much refined over the patches.  Likely inspired by Civ, but not a bad inspiration at that.- Excellent tooltips. Every unit has all its abilities and current stats available at a click, no searching through menus or having to remember who does what.  This lets you focus on stratagy, and not memory tests.- Unit models. Personally I love how there is a version of each class unit for every race, they didn't skimp out on the design budget by making generic models.  Also, Goblin Angels!Cons-The campaigns are not the greatest feats of storytelling. But they do give a good vehicle for the stratagy, and a reason for the objectives.- The first expansion campaign (I haven't played Eternal Lords yet) was frustrating because it was basically a long tutorial for the new features, when I would rather have had all those new features through the campaign.  Except possibly the seals, which make sense at the point they are at (I'm not giving any spoilers here!)- There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to how nuetral factions act towards you.  This may be addressed with the proposed changes to races in Eternal Lords.- The randomly generated maps do produce some wierd anomalies from time to time, but I believe these are being refined.Over all, this game deserves its 80% approval rating, and I heartily recommend it to both fans of the series and other turn-bases stratagy or empire building fans.

												Civ 5 meets Final Fantasy Tactics in a Warhammer-like universe.It's easy enough to start playing ASAP, but there's just layers and layers of strategic and tactical depth. There's such a huge combination of Races, Classes, and specializations, that no two playthroughs need to be the same.Play as a Goblin Necromancer, slowly expanding your empire throughout the dark underground.Play as a Elven Rogue, converting your territory into thick forests to conceal your armies of assassins.Play as a Dwarf Dreadnaut, crushing enemy forces under the weight of iron.

												Fun Civ like game with a more comprehensive and interesting combat that is still hex based but on the battlefield unlike Endless Legend. If you like Endless Legend or Civ I highly recommend playing this one (and I mean its almost exactly like endless legend). The game also feels a lot like the board game heroscape with some of the heros and powers. Finally, the music kinda sucks so big minus in comparison to Civ V's fantastic score.			"

												Great game.  I got this on release and have clocked a lot of hours on it, but I waited to recommend it.I waited because it had a few balance and playability issues otu of the box, which have been adressed with patches and the Dev's listening to the community.Pros- Good division between the classes and races, everyone is good at, and weak at, something.  This makes the choice meaningful.- A style which is both functional and cool looking.- Excellent in-game encyclopedia, much refined over the patches.  Likely inspired by Civ, but not a bad inspiration at that.- Excellent tooltips. Every unit has all its abilities and current stats available at a click, no searching through menus or having to remember who does what.  This lets you focus on stratagy, and not memory tests.- Unit models. Personally I love how there is a version of each class unit for every race, they didn't skimp out on the design budget by making generic models.  Also, Goblin Angels!Cons-The campaigns are not the greatest feats of storytelling. But they do give a good vehicle for the stratagy, and a reason for the objectives.- The first expansion campaign (I haven't played Eternal Lords yet) was frustrating because it was basically a long tutorial for the new features, when I would rather have had all those new features through the campaign.  Except possibly the seals, which make sense at the point they are at (I'm not giving any spoilers here!)- There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to how nuetral factions act towards you.  This may be addressed with the proposed changes to races in Eternal Lords.- The randomly generated maps do produce some wierd anomalies from time to time, but I believe these are being refined.Over all, this game deserves its 80% approval rating, and I heartily recommend it to both fans of the series and other turn-bases stratagy or empire building fans.

												Me and my wife have been strategy fans for quite sometime. We have played just about everything since Xcom UFO Defense (1994). Turn-based strategy games are our preferred taste. We play boardgames quite often here at home and civilization V has been our favorite on the screen for awhile. We have been on the hunt for quite sometime to increase our library of favorites and Age of Wonders III does not disappoint. Do you like to explore, research, upgrade, loot, expand, and to conquer? Age of Wonders III is a ""one more turn"" welcoming addiction.+ Excellent lore+ Unit information codex is very useful when planning strategies+ useful tooltips on city management, units, building types, and terrain types, and icon information.+ Great visuals (When you zoomout all the way the world turns into a fantasy paper map, nice touch)+ Create your own library of custom Leaders (Play as your own unique leader and create custom leaders for the AI, its your own world)+ LOTS of options (Simultaneous turns, classic turns, auto or manual battles with replay, random map generation, terrain type sliders, allow adjustments to just about every category you can think of.+ Excellent replayability+ HOTSEAT and online multiplayer support+ Great developer support+ Excellent Music Score- Bugs- Online multiplayer requires some firewall tweaking- optimzation a bit rough (unusual slowdowns and gfx issues)			"

												This game is pretty fun, but it gets frustrating once you find all the little flaws. For example, you engage a stack of creatures listed as ""Very Likely Victory"", use the auto-combat to speed up the game. Bam, your entire army is dead an you didn't kill a single opponent. Either the probabiliy indicator is a piece of crap or the auto-combat is a piece of crap. Either way, longer games are horrible since you have to do every combat manually unless you want to risk losing your entire army, which essentially means you lose the game as well.			"

												I'll start with the good news: this really is a worthy successor to the earlier parts of the series, and I definitely recommend it to any fan of turn-based strategy games.That said, it does have a few flaws that need to be addressed.- The alignment system...doesn't work. There's no penalty to playing the good guy, so you'll pretty much always gravitate towards a Pure Good alignment unless you make a deliberate effort to be evil, and since there are distinct penalties for playing the bad guy you end up gimping yourself in the progress.- While the move to 3D certainly improved animation quality, some models (especially flying creatures) are just plain hideous to look at. I have absolutely no idea what they were trying to achieve with the gryphon, for example :P.- The loss of many staple races is a bit of a pain, although the new class-based units do help to put some of the variety back in.- Speaking of that, some things about the race/class system aren't exactly explained very well. Class units of different races do have noticably different stats, which is something you're left to find out for yourself (hint: elves, as usual, do very well with any kind of ranged attack).- And finally, there's a certain amount of interface clunkiness going on. No major showstoppers, but a lot of minor things that'll get a little annoying over time.So...what makes this worth buying despite the flaws I just outlined?- A solid TBS experience with RPG elements.- A fun, if somewhat cliché'd setting.- Amazing music.- Elven musketeers.- The classes really do offer vastly different playstyles. If you try the approach you won with as a Warlord with an Archdruid character, you will probably fail pretty hard.- Character traits make a huge difference in playstyle as well.- Goblin angels.- Random map generator with good fine-tuning options provides long-term replayability.- The series' trademark sense of humor is still around and going strong, particularly in the unit descriptions.All in all, a very solid game despite some flaws, and probably the best of its kind out right now.

												A master piece of turn based strategy goodness. If you are a fan of turn based/fantasy strategy games, or any type of turnbased strategy war games, buy this right now.Important to note that this is a turnbased startegy war/4X game, if you're looking for detailed empire/ economic management you won't find it here. City building has enough options to be interesting, but you don't feel like you are governing cities. You're leading an empire to war.			"

IMO, if you like RPG's and strategy it's a must buy.			"

Posted: March 5, 2016
												Let me preface this by saying I love the Age of Wonders series. I played AOW1, AOW2, and AOW:SM a ton back when I was a kid. I am not writing a negative review lightly.I guess I will start off with what AOW3 did right:Continuation of the Age of Wonders story and a revival of the franchise.Nostalgic musical score consisting of AOW1 remixes. I'm not sure if I heard any AOW2/SM music though.Vassal cities. Not having to manually manage my less-important cities is really nice, and it gives another layer of diplomacy besides player-to-player....I'm supposed to write more, right? ...Right?No seriously, that's the extent of what I can consider as good in AOW3. What I listed is self-explanatory, so I will move on to the meat of this review.What I found AOW3 did wrong; why it doesn't feel like Age of Wonders:The absence of trademark spells like Enchant Weapon and Blessing (no not the in-combat only Blessing AOW3 has).The absence of heroes like Winger and Ham, heroes that were present in all three of the previous AOW games.Ripping off Civilization in GUI layout and general gameplay. ""Empire upgrades"", you mean technology? And whatever happened to researching spells that looked and did amazing stuff?! Hellfire from AOW2/SM, where is it?!Lack of unit and building depth. Archers are king, cities are ""finished"" when in AOW1/2/SM we would still be in earlygame. Domains are nerfed and cannot overlap each other, they are not so much ""magical sphere of influence"" as they are borders like in Civ; see below.Very shallow leader/hero design. Unlike the previous games I am finding a problem what I should be doing with my leader and heroes. The leader can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥sitting in town like before in AOW2/SM, and the leader being nerfed like such compared to the wizards in AOW2/SM means the heroes are also nerfed in their utility. Unlike AOW1, their presence isn't all that large either; forget mowing down entire armies singlehandedly, not happening here.Straight off, AOW3 does not feel like a continuation of Age of Wonders 1, 2, and Shadow Magic. Trademark spells and heroes are missing, the way the game flows is changed to be more in the venue of Civ. Honestly, I think AOW3 is more Civilization 5 with a fantasy reskin than Age of Wonders revived.AOW3 lost the unique identity that AOW1/2/SM managed to create, I don't feel that AOW3 distinguishes itself enough from the other strategy games (4X strategy in particular) in the industry like AOW1/2/SM did. If someone told me AOW3 was a Civ5 fantasy mod, I would believe them.What I found AOW3 did wrong; the technical faults:Terrible graphics. There, I said it. Compared to other games of the same genre like Civilization, the graphics are horrible. The image simply isn't sharp, aliasing is everywhere even with anti-aliasing enabled. It feels like I'm playing the game in a smaller resolution than my monitor's native resolution, even though I am not. All the models are also ridiculously low-poly and the textures low-res by today's standards, and I have the options set on high! (I can run ultra with a minor FPS drop, but I don't see any improvement.)Clunky tactical combat. The combat in AOW1/2/SM was one of the highlights of the series. Battles were fun and exciting, especially siege battles involving cities. Casting Hellfire and seeing the city furiously burn was amazing. Not here. Sieges just feel like a chore, and field battles are dominated by archers. Melee units are just meatshield fodder. I find myself preferring auto combat over manual combat. This is Age of Wonders, why does the combat feel so unappealing?!The revamped alignment system. Why in the seven wizards of the cosmos am I ""evil"" for migrating to my preferred races? For plundering and razing cities? For killing independent guards? None of these acts were even remotely ""evil"" before on a global level. In fact migrations were strongly encouraged regardless if you were playing a ""good"" wizard. I see little sense in the way the alignment system was revamped and implemented.Halflings as DLC simply rubs me the wrong way. Halflings were one of the mainstays in the series, and they were axed in the base AOW3 release before seeing a DLC release. Really? I might have gotten it still if the game was enjoyable, but I'm having doubts as this review might suggest.All in all, I am seriously saddened that I just can't bring myself to recommend this game. I really wanted to write a positive review, I adored the Age of Wonders series! Unfortunately, as a loving fan I just cannot bring myself to lie and upvote. If you have never played any of the old Age of Wonders games then you might be able to enjoy this game, but  as a long-time fan I was sorely disappointed.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 is a very good game, especially as far as 4X fantasy games go.Sadly it's missing a lot of content that even AoW 2 had. Namely a lot of races, the frostlings, and undead aren't here. The same for necromancy aka the sphere of death.

												After 20 years, Master of Magic finally gets a worthy spiritual successor. If you're into turn-based strategy with a magical twist, get this game. If you loved the original Master of Magic but found several recent games that tried to recapture its (ahem) magic but end up feeling a bit off (I'm looking at you Fallen Enchantress/Warlock Master of the Arcane/Endless Legend), you will not be disappointed by Age of Wonders 3. The thing that I love most about AOW 3 that it shares with Master of Magic is that the tech tree has a lot of real gamechangers. It's not just wussy +10% attack/defense/economy improvements here, no. On one turn you're playing with cookie-cutter pike/archers/cavalry, then on the next turn you research something and suddenly you have FLOATING ELDRITCH HORRORS FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION that can mind-control your enemies and panic the puny mortals that dare attack them. Or you level up your hero and suddenly YOUR ENTIRE UNIT STACK IS NOW INVISIBLE TO THE ENEMY.You don't win battles just because your attack/defense numbers are better than the enemy. You win battles by casting a spell that makes half of the enemy army run away in panic, sending in succubi to seduce the half that remained to fight for you, then use your new mind-controlled minions to kill their former allies. If you're going to play a 4X game set in a magical world, you don't want the game to just replace artillery with fireballs, rifles with bows and tanks with steampunk tanks, you want to see all the craziness that is possible in a magical world. This AOW 3 delivers really, really well.			"

												I should have reviewed this game long ago.Age of Wonders 3 is an amazing fantasy turn based 4x with rpg elements, and a fantastic array of choices, customization and tactical options.I would sit here and list them all, but I will condense it to afew points.Have you ever played a 4x and wanted to actually be on the battlefield? To have a presence? In AoW 3 you can, as a sovereign you can fight on the battlefield (and revive if killed too) gain levels, and lead a glorious army, or have your heroes do it for you (or fight alongside them) Have you ever wanted to be able to both play a nice, friendly, intercultural hero of the people? Or be the devious evil genociding brutal wizard lord? Both are viable strategies, and have their strengths and weaknesses especially with all the new updates related to alignment, and racial approval/happiness.Do you itch for a game with a varied class selection of rather different yet equal classes? From the ttrategy, tactics, and military might of the warlord, and the sneaky cunning of the rogue to the vast arcane power of the wizard and religious/moral power of the theocrat (and several other classes, alongside the necromancer soon to be released) you have access to a vast array of balanced, interesting, and flavorful classes.Balance is both already good, and improving all the time as the developers follow the approach of Adding content, and adding power rather than simply cutting content, and nerfing to improve balance, orks not strong enough? We aughta give them a new unit option, and a damage buff, not nerf everyone else. It's wonderful, and so very productive.All in all do I feel like I got my money's worth with this purchase? I very much do, I was worried after years without a new game that this game would fail to live up to the nostalgia of AoW Shadow Magic, instead it actually improved upon it's predecessor, and captured my attentions all over again. I'd rate this game 9.5 out of 10, the highest rating of any game in my 450+ title library. If you're a fan of 4x, rpgs, or fantasy and are even remotely considering this title I give you my absolute recommendation.Well what are you waiting for? Buy it! (if you must wait for a sale then fine, but at any price under 30 bucks this game is just too good to pass up you owe it to yourself)			"

												Age of Wonders 3 for me is the best TBS-game on the market. I admit, I am a fan since AoW1 but the game changed quite a bit since then and still I think it's great! At the beginning when watching the first trailers I was concerned that the game might lose clarity gameplaywise due to the newer 3D-graphics but I think Triumph Studios did a perfect job - a good balance between looks and gameplay. Even though it's not a Battlefield 4 hyperrealistic graphicstyle I think it's looking fantastic and it fits. Next I was concerned of the class and race system Triumph introduced with this game. In the older games there weren't classes but tons of races. This time there were only 6 races ( at the beginning. DLCs and expansion bring more races and classes ) and 6 classes. I underestimated the impact of the different classes and races - the mix of each class and race has its own benefits and playstyles. Not only class and race but also specialisations such as Fire Adept, Partisan, Expansionst add a lot of depth to the game. If you think about it there is a lot to explore in the game, a lot to remember when playing as there are loads of little features that sweaten your experience. At last I was concerned about the new border-system for the cities. In the past titles you could conquer whatever you want and no matter how far away from your cities the sites were you gained income. In this title you only gain income from sites that are in your territory which expands around your cities. This on the other hand adds another important factor: Settlement placement. When playing the game I don't feel like missing something out of the older titles. - Well, of course I'd be glad about more variations but this is exactly what the developers are working on at the moment. One DLC has been published just half a year after the release of the main title - hand in hand with big free content-patches - and a big expansion including a new race _and_ a new class is already far developed as far as I can tell. The developers really listen to the community in the AoW3 own forums. They are very active in the forums comparing them to other bigger studios. This is another very big plus for Triumph. I can only recommend this title, the DLC and the upcoming expansion. - Triumph releases weekly dev-blogs on their page to give updates about some of the new features that are being worked on.			"

												Age of Wonders 3 brings the modest and shy greatness that AoW1 was into the modern world, retaining much of it's old feeling and that of the other prequels, AoW2 and AoW2SM, while sharing some of the best traits with more strongly established franchises and holding a general environment / atmosphere really pleasant to the eye. If you prefer fantasy worlds and a slight touch of RPG elements, this will make you forget Civilization. Age of wonders is much less linear, and what it lacks in management complexity, it makes up with more elaborate combat and exploration.			"

												It is quite fun for the first few maps, but quickly gets boring. The game has a crippling lack of depth and gets extremely repetative after the first few games. The game is pretty much solely focused on combat, as combat is the only win condition and there is very little strategy outside of it. The tactical combat is well done and enjoyable for a little while, however most games end up with armies full of the highest tier units smacking into each other. The game gets extremely boring quite quickly because of that. Would not recommend at full price.			"

												edit: Like the start of my original review. Most underrated game ever. It's awesome.. seriously get it.Incredibly underrated game.In the past I played AoW 1 and 2 so when AoW 3 was announced I was looking forward to it, but the reviews weren't that positive and Endless Legend got released which got quite good reviews so I preferred that one. While Endless Legend doesn't manage to capture my attention I played some other games. Eventually AoW 3 was on sale and I thought... whatever let's do it.Without high anticipations the game kinda blew me away. What an incredible atmosphere! The tactical fights are really good and the strategy is ok, but this game just really DEMANDS me to play 1 more turn. It was a long time ago that I really couldn't stop.. keep on delaying the time I was going to quit.Now I also bought the Golden Realms expansion and it's even better! The best part is still to come though! The upcoming expansion Eternal Lords will offer a new class and 2 more races, but also a loooooooot more depth to an allready quite deep game imo! 1 of the things they worked on which was really poor is Diplomacy which is great. AI will have different personalities nad being evil or good actually influences your playstyle.Just really get this game if you like 4x, it's worth it. No doubt!			"

												I really want to like this game, the AI is very competent and atmosphere is fantastic. But the campaign is designed to frustrate you rather than entertain. The first scenario is a brief  introduction of the basic game mechanism. On the second scenario, the AI just steamroller you, without further explanations, when you still barely have a clue what buildings are and what units do what. There are also very bad game design decisions. In battles there is no deployment phase, and the computer always manage to put your units in the worst possible starting position. Frequently, the AI charges and kill your heroes on the first turn, without giving a chance and if one of your heroes die, it is game over. So the best thing you can do is to hide them behind and hope the computer will not sneak from behind, making the whole purpose of the heroes useless.  "

Manual battles take 5 minutes or so to complete and this game FORCES you to sit there and watch every single time someone goes into a battle, meaning it could take 20 minutes each turn of just waiting and watching other players do this boring combat system, if you're looking to play this game for the multiplayer, do NOT buy it. Not to mention the game does not work with screen resolutions above 1920x1080 if your screen is bigger expect black boxes and blurryness.			"

ALL BUILDINGS ARE THE SAME FOR EVERY RACE.Omg, horrible. I was really bored. played a random 8 player map with 6 players including me. all A.I were at king level.  Spells were good and had alot of variety. however diplomacy is lacking and there is like nothing to do in the map, because like all units and all buildings, the entire map was populated by basically the same few structures and all monsters were basically the same few types with different names.diplomacy wise, the auto balance is a nice touch. However take note that the crazy A.I will constant trespass on your borders and you will be FLOODED with messages about it. there is no diplomacy option to enfore or follow up on this border thing.overall i have to say it was BORING. Graphics were nice and i encountered only 1 CTD during the whole game. "

												The game is a very fun and great 4x tile, with more of a focus on combat and quicker overall 4x game than a much deeper 4x like civ. Because of this you get cooler rpg systems, great combat (the best selling feature of this game because of the abundance of units, skills that are varied and useful (just always attacking is not the best way to go, I like this), heros, mana/spells, maps that reflect 4x map, and much more), more action, and just overall fun. So maybe not the absolute deepest 4x, but worth it because it has a different focus which makes it unique and different from other 4x. Also with the continued development and expansions, and optional mods the game has gotten way better. So if you pasted it up before, look into it again and see if it is for you. If you like 4x games, this could become one of your favorites! PS (The sales price is awesome at 75%, but I have no regrets buying the game with only the small price cut that I got.)			"

												Just got this game and I don't know who made what first but this is my first time playing a game in the AoW franchise and found it's pretty much the same game as HoMM, although... it's fun. HoMM failed on the fun part their last couple installments and this game delivers. It's a good time. Not to blow my own horn but I think the AI is pretty weak in this, I tried normal difficulty and it was a joke, then 1 up from normal and it still wasn't much of a challlenge. AI would declare war on me, I'd wipe him out without breaking a sweat, I'd try to make peace with the next guy, nope he wants war... he's dead too, etc.Having individual troops in your army rather than stacks of troops like in HoMM is a big improvement. You get more of a feel for how tough your guys are rather than having to always check how big the stack is and do some mental math. Your magic will be strong but not broken and so far I've played 2 classes (Warlord and Sorcerer) and the style of play changes quite a lot so it adds some variety. You get to cast spells both in combat and in the global map and the global spells / disjuction side of the game is very relevant. In combat, your hero can be strong but not that relevant as a fighting unit lategame, but  you'll have spells that make massive impact.As with most TBS games, at the end of the turn the AI helps you control your stuff by prompting you to confirm your orders for your units or give orders to units with none (of course it won't bother you if you ""Garrison"" the units). But it's kinda reduntant, if I give a unit a move order that takes 5 turns to complete, it won't just automove every turn, it will prompt me to confirm his journey for the next 5 turns. Kinda pointless. Another thing I'd like is to be able to have a town governor or something to build my cities up for me without me having to bother with microing it. Late game, I just wanna manage my armies, not click through the repetative build orders of my 20-30 city empire. I would also like a minister of defence or something so he could worry about  sending my troops out to defend my cities, let me pick what goes in the garrison of border cities  and safe zone cities but don't make me do it myself. hehe. Also the builder unit could use some automation, ""go around and make roads to connect my cities"" seems a boring task I shouldn't have to micro myself.Okay enough ranting about my pet peeves, overall the game is great and a welcome addition to the turn based strategy genre.I recommend buying if you like this style of game, there's not many out there that are more fun.

												This is a nice addition to the AoW series, with improved graphics etc but I can't help feeling a little disappointed with in (or   perhaps didn;t enjoy it as much as I would have liked.  The main issue is that it gets a little repetitive, whether it is on the world map or the same fights played.... personally I found myself wanting to auto-combat a lot, which on other games such as Heroes of Might and Magic I would't.  The differences between the factions/races are not as different as they were in AoW2, so really doesn't matter too much which side you choose. The jumps between difficulty levels seems a little excessive too.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good game, and those who are new to it or enjoy the AoW series and others such as Heroes of Might and Magic or Kings Bounty will enjoy this too, but  after the first campaign is completed you may think twice about starting the second one so the longevity of this game is affected (in my opinion).  In summary, its a good game but not great!			"

It's a lot more eye pleasing, mechancically balanced, deffinitely polished more than previous games, and they brought back the Hero character (like from the 1st AoW) Which I love love love!!!! <3 I just hope they impliment the Necromancer as they said they were going to do.So mostly this game gets 9/10 with me. The overall game is amazing, but wish they didn't merge the Elves/Dark Elves and remove the Undead :P (aka less amount of races was a turn off, but not a game stopper for me) <3 I love you forever Triumph!

												This game is very entertaining. I am mainly writing to respond to criticisms that the game lacks depth, which initially made me hestitant about the game. The sale price of 19.99 USD tipped the scales in favor of the game (I was also considering Solar Empire and Endless Space). I'm glad the sale was going on because so far this is a great purchase. For a pure 4x game, I could see a lack of depth. However, this game is a hybrid between a 4x and RPG. I find RPGs too shallow to hold my interest, but the RPG elements here add a facet to this game that I haven't seen in other 4x games. The fact that it's unique makes it interesting. True...the research tree is anemic, but I have a lot of fun learning the spells, which have a fresh and dynamic affect on every aspect of the gaming experience. But to me, the RPG-style battle engine is what takes this to the next level. It is somewhat complex and very engaging, and mixed with more traditional 4x aspects, AOW III provides a nice experience that has kept my interest through that crucial first 24 hours. It also helps that the gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and the graphics are beautiful. So far, this is my favorite purchase since Civ V. One note is that I did have a crash. However, this was after a 14-hour session.			"

												I love this game.  It's pretty much like you remember if you've played previous AoW entries.  If you haven't, basically it's a 4x fantasy game where you play a powerful mage in command of your chosen fantasy race (dwarves, elves, etc.).  The game is quite fun but I could leave the campaigns at the door.  Sandbox is where it's at.  If you like turn-based games, grab this one.  It's excellent.			"

												Love playing the game! Underworld layer adds a totally new map that you need to keep an eye on as you strategize on the overworld. Become the White Witch or Elsa and turn your empire into a perpetual winter. Spells and chess-like combat sections make fighting fun and more strategic than other games like civ. If you have an army disadvantage, it can be turned to your advantage with good strategy. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who loves 4x games like civ!			"

												6/10. Will probably reinstall eventually. Graphics reign supreme in this remake. I don't much care for the sound but that is typical for me. The game play is quite annoying at times but it is no different than AOW  and AOWII in that sense. Mainly the randomness is what is annoying. That said it is quite playable even with autocombat being terribad. The sameness of the item/skill set does not encourage long games (once you have a complete set of slots you probably don't care about the rest of the dungeons) and the AI is opportunistic (a + thing) but not hard to predict (a - thing). The indicators of how tough a battle will be are frankly disappointing but I have yet to play a game where the predictors were 100%. The fact is, at a certain point you will probably roll over all the Epic, Mythic and Legendary dungeon battles with ease. Full item slots are a must upgrade for this goal. Mainly, it lacks excitement for me but some things about the game are really solid and if I get a hankering for a Warlords style game again I will likely reinstall. I highly recommend playing with your own leader once you figure out how the system works. There is nothing wrong with the stock PCs but they are a little boring. Sadly part of what makes the game lackluster for me is the small variety in the customizable leader abilities. On the other hand every hero you have becomes somewhat customizable once you level them. The points system for doing so seems a little imbalanced and again the variety seems lacking but I expect they withheld a lot of the innovation for DLCs. So you might want to wait for those if you live for diversity. I got the game on sale and for under $8 it is a must buy if you like Warlords style games.			"

												The game is really interesting and comes with a vast array of possibilities between the races anc classes, offering the game a good durability. However, the AI levels are not really balanced to the point it is not even worth playing against Squire or Knight AI and the highest level is, in my opinion, way too hard. I would recommend starting as an outpost and working towards making it grow to a village, town, etc... This game is best enjoyed played in local or multiplayer online, challenging other RL players.

												I would recommend the game (Unless you haven't played EndlessLegend yet), but only if you really like hex based games. As the combat and map are all hex based it's a bit of a mix between civ/pandra map style but with more focus on fighting then building/diplomacy as the options are limited and buildings/research can be completed quickly. The magic is a nice mechanic to change things up from the civ style and to changing the outcomes of battles but without dominating too much I haven't found it as much fun as CIV or Pandora although CIV Costs more Pandora Costs lessStart with CIV/EnglessLegend/Pandora			"

												Lots of style, little substance. I've always gravitated towards 4X games, so when Age of Wonders III came out, I was naturally pretty hyped. However, after playing it, there's quite a few flaws I've noticed about the game:- Character customization is extremely limited- Game is a resource hog. My computer's pretty decent and I still got huge lag spikes pretty frequently- It is far, far too easy to steamroll in this game. Once you've captured one city, the rest is just details. - Very, very little variety. A few leader classes and races and that's it. There's not much assortment of monsters, either, even with the expansion. And lastly, the game simply doesn't have any 'soul'. Remember Heroes of Might and Magic III, where each and every artifact had a little story behind it? Or Fall From Heaven 2, where each faction had a long and sordid history? Or even Fallen Enchantress, with a bit of both? Yeah, none of that's here. The game world is pretty much the blandest you could imagine, with a color palette apparently ripped from Fable 2 that just does not jive with the tone the rest of the game tries to set.			"

												I love this game, and I can't believe it took me so long to get into it. Seriously, I bought this game shortly after it came out, but put it on a back burner because I had a Hearts of Iron 3 campaign going. AoWIII looked complicated, and it is a steep learning curve. The action bar at the bottom right of the screen helps you take all the actions you can during the turn. The game tells you to research a new skill. It tells you to select what to build in each city, etc. It tells you that an army needs movement orders. Next thing you know, two hours have passed. I give it two thumbs way up.			"

												It takes a few attempts to get used to playing AOW3 (I restarted my random map game 4 times) even if you are an experienced Civ5/4X player. Don't let the critics fool you, it is not similiar to Civ5 (other than being a 4X game) as it is hugely combat based.What you are looking at is a game similiar to Fallen Enchantress, AOW3 is like the direct upgrade of Fallen Enchantress in terms of graphics and gameplay.Or if you are a veteran Civ5 player it might not matter in this game because it's a whole new different challenge and experience. Get this game if you want something new and fresh into your 4X.			"

												So far, this game is living up to they hype.  Having a chance to play every race and class, there seem to be perhaps the need for a few minor balancing issues.  Most of the main concerns are already underway in future patch releases.  Minor bugs exist, but nothing game-breaking from what I have seen.  The ONLY downside so far is the inability to connect directly to play with a friend.  Fiddling with the router/port forwarding, etc may be necessary to play across their servers in multiplayer.This game gives more versatility than any of the previous games with the class/race system.  It stays simplified and is quick to pick up if having played previous games.  One new difference is the DOMAIN feature.  It sure saves from scrambling for nodes!For those who have not played any of the previous games in this series, it is a turn-based tactical game.  Multiplayer tends to be slower than single, but with customizable terrains to add to the random map generating, options are endless!			"

I particulerly enjoy  seeing how diffrent races place with diffrent classes, one amusing and particulerly fun comb   is halfing (added from golden realms) are paired with the necromancer classm I mean really nothing beat a halfing famer ghoul that ignores most attacks,  while throwing chicken that distract and damage  enemies AND drains life. triumph has made me a very happy customer.

Great fantasy strategy game got even better with patchesRecent patches (June 2015) really improved the gameplay. There are too many changes to list, but you might want to check it out if played the initial game version but not recently.  One paragraph description of AoWTo me, AoWIII is the best of the fantasy strategy genre which includes: Might & Magic, King's Bounty, Warlock, King Arthur, Eador, etc. Gameplay is centered around managing a few heroes which gain strength by leveling, research, and acquiring items. Your heroes can also lead armies and capture cities. Cities allow you to build more units and improve resources. Combat is turn-based on a hex map against a challenging AI. Hero items and experience persist between campaign missions which take awhile to finish.If you liked the previous AoWs, this is a great sequel, similar to what Civ5 is to Civ4. Everything gets better.			"

Age of Wonders 3 is a great take on the Civilization 5 formula. And yes, it copies the formula almost exactly in terms of UI and general gameplay.The differences come in the fantastic fantasy setting created, playing as humans, elves, goblins, etc and fighting with or against eachother and the various monsters of the realm.The combat is a turn based instance with a ton of options and interesting characters and abilities.There were some major problems with the AI. They would always end up hating you for doing ""bad"" things even though you did nothing at all or someone else did to you instead. For instance, I would garner hate because other nations would trespass in to MY territory. Thankfully most of these issues seem to have been fixed with the patches and DLC, but watch out for them!

												I've been playing the videogame for a while. I've been waiting ages since age of wonders 2. The game, generally, is really good. It's the same game, just improved graphically and with some new features (such as vassalls system). The only thing that I don't really like is that , imho, you can unlock powerful units in a short time, and once this is done, you can simply create them and conquest around... That's what I didn't like of this game.. Basic units such as swordsmen and archers become almost useless if you have big creatures spawned everywhere. I think it should be rebalanced.. maybe with a maximum amount of special / powerful units that can be summoned / recruited. At least, this way, the game would be more challenging and strategic, and every unit would count in your army. But, generally, the game is really good.			"

												The Age of Wonders series has always been the torchbearer for Master of Magic. Age of Wonders 3 (which is actually the 4th game in the series) strays from that original template by actually brining very solid balance to all the various factions in the game, making it something you can play in multiplayer without having to set a bunch of houserules ahead of time. It is pretty, the tactical combat is well designed (and by well designed I mean superior leadership can make a huge difference in the outcome) it has a deep strategic game, and there is a huge variety of units. Each class plays very differently from one another, and each class plays off of the various races differently as well. There has been outstanding post launch support, both bug-fixes, and new content.			"

												The game is a very fun and great 4x tile, with more of a focus on combat and quicker overall 4x game than a much deeper 4x like civ. Because of this you get cooler rpg systems, great combat (the best selling feature of this game because of the abundance of units, skills that are varied and useful (just always attacking is not the best way to go, I like this), heros, mana/spells, maps that reflect 4x map, and much more), more action, and just overall fun. So maybe not the absolute deepest 4x, but worth it because it has a different focus which makes it unique and different from other 4x. Also with the continued development and expansions, and optional mods the game has gotten way better. So if you pasted it up before, look into it again and see if it is for you. If you like 4x games, this could become one of your favorites! PS (The sales price is awesome at 75%, but I have no regrets buying the game with only the small price cut that I got.)			"

												I started on Age of Wonders way back in the end of high school / beginning of college. I loved it. I played by myself until I met a guy in one of my college classes that just happened to play as well. I've spent days worth of time playing the original.  AoW2, both with and without the expansion, were great games. Really enjoyed them too. My big complaint, and the big complaint that will forever keep me from really thoroughly enjoying this game is the release of the rest of the races that should have been included in the original game as add on content. It's really a shame, IMO, that a game with such great pedigree would be reduced to peddling out it's content for additional dollars. AoW3 devs, you've turned my innocent little game that I loved so much into the video game equivalent of the meth addicted stripper exchanging illicit favors for money.			"

												Ago of Wonders 3, is a fantasy 4X game.Fun challenging campaigns.Multiple races, classes, and magic.  So lots of combo's to explore and test out.Evil and Good also to throw into the mix of combos.Dev's are adding content and DLC.Great multi-player system.  (taking your turn the same time others do so less waiting)Truthfully more of a exterminate type player, so I can't speak much on the diplomacy parts of the game.Veteran bonuses for creatures in your army.I was a huge fan of Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic.  Really all around great game.  Does the Age of Wonders franchise justice.  If you were thinking of picking up a 4X fantasy game and your choices were: Age of Wonders 3 versus Heroes of Might and Magic 6.  In my opinion, I would purchase Age of Wonders 3.			"

												The Good:+ Stunning graphics that work well even on slightly older cards+ Excellent soundtrack and score+ Vibrant races that all feel different to play+ A solid single player campaign that engages, feels epic and teaches you what you need to know+ A fantastic battle system that rewards strategic play+ A re-balance on some of the dominant races from the last couple of gamesThe Bad:- The CPUs in the single player campaign have a tendency to turtle, such that it can get a little infuriating- No magical sphere system like in AoW2 & Shadow Magic, something I enjoyed- Manual strategic combat is very time consuming (still fun, but so time consuming!)- Just one more tu-...  oh god, is that the sun?All in all, AoW3 was worth the wait and seems like a fantastic successor to the franchise.  Fans of the AoW series, turn-based strategies, strategic fantasies or all of the above should definitely get this game.			"

												By and large a solid successor to the Age of Wonders series. The combat's been cleaned up to be even more fun, the visuals are nicer, the mechanics more enjoyable and the calculations behind the results more visible, making it far easier to tell what to do to improve your odds and worsen your enemy's. Also features better enemy AI, in my opinion.About the only downside is that a lot of campaign time involves you hauling around sub-heroes that aren't allowed to die, but it's a minor annoyance. You CAN keep them alive, but sometimes you get pinned into situations where all you can do is either cheat, repeatedly reload autosaves hoping for a lucky break OR skip back several turns to your last manual save so you didn't maneuver one of them into an unsaveable situation.It also feels like the spellbook is a lot slimmer for each class(but also like leader class actually matters a lot more this time around, heroes are another system that's vastly improved). I found myself casting spells a lot less than during Shadow Magic... but on the other hand I also found a lot less battles decided by who had the Casting Points left over to spam ""affects all enemies""-spells.Mostly the game feels at a bit of a shortage for ""mid-range"" spells. That is, spells that aren't as battle-changing as Mass Panic, Smoke Screen or the druid's beast summoning, but still have more effect than just outright attacking with your leader(or having them use an ability like Convert or such). At the moment it feels like most of the spells are either AT the level of just attacking/using an ability or they're huge battlefield-affecting stuff.Still, overall, I'd say the game's an improvement on Shadow Magic, which my impression is that most people consider to be the apex of Age of Wonders so far. The expansions are also nice additions.And of course the soundtrack is just to die for. I absolutely love it.Only thing I have absolute criticism for is the voice-overs between campaign missions. They're just not very well done, though the writing's fine.			"

												Age of wonders was a great joy of my younger years.I was pleasantly surprised to see a new installment in the franchise and decided to dive right in.Everything from before is fantastically revitalized and remodeled, if only a little basic on the animation side; it quickly makes up for it with a broad scope of customization and fantastically well executed strategical elements.Fans of the fire emblem series will be also be joyously engrossed in similar feelings as they try to keep their favoured units in play, while deeply engrossed in the sheer magnitude of the leader skill tree and stat progression.one of my new favourites; Highly recommended.

												Civilization V meets Heroes of Might & Magic is how I would best describe this game.The fantasy setting is hardly original but the game is gorgeously presented with an easy to use interface, lovely artwork and graphics (anti-aliasing is poor but you can force MSAA+SGSSAA via the driver if you have an NVIDIA graphics card) and a wonderfully atmospheric musical score that fits the game perfectly.Thankfully, the game plays as good as it looks and sounds as well. I've found the game to be very immersive and entertaining, even relaxing as you can focus on building up your cities and forces and set the combat to Auto and just watch it unfold in real-time if you wish.If you are a fan of this genre then this is a must-have in my opinion.

												Age of wonders is a fun game to play with friends, simpler than Sid Meiers Civilization series while powering most of the same punches, this game is well worth the purchase if multiplayer is your focus.Alternatively, Age of Wonders simplicity is its downfall as the game quickly loses the players interest in a single-player environment. A weak story, last-gen model graphics, and a strangely flat ""custom hero"" option leaves me wondering if Age of Wonders shouldn't be classified as an Arcade title, rather than a full-package game.

												The 4th Age of Wonders is awesome. A gorgeous Fantasy 4X - Hex-grid world much like ""Civilisation 5"" but with ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" combat (except heros participate & units don't weaken, they are full strength until dead). So AOW3 is also similar to ""Warlock:Master of the Arcane"" 1 & 2, except for the combat of course, also AOW3 has more depth. Pro- Great graphics- great unit variety including evil penguins and other strange units- variety of spells & status effects- you don't skip battles because they are fun- editor- several unit stacks joining for bigger battles- Veterans of 4X and TBS will love AOW3- hero leveling, items and the different mounts (with models)- diplomacy - a basic system but it does have oneCon- City/Empire management needs improving: I wish AOW3 had the steamline features of Civilisations 4 & 5 (eg, next town button or an AI City manager)- City management is not complex unlike rest of the game and the genre.- doesn't explain all concepts.- enemy sniping your heroes for instant Game Fail is really annoying - use care and save scum.- just one more turn....- AOW3's ""civ-o-pedia"" is good but it is no civ-o-pedia.AOW3 will blow away Sid Meier's Civilisations with a good expansion pack.

												  Game is intersting, but suffers from a fatal flaw:  your cities are indefensible without substantial investment in time and units.  Given how expensive units are in the game, you can either defend your cities, or quest with your armies, but will have problems doing both.  Further, the AI can see your defences and assemble armies capable of taking them, and you get at most a 1 turn warning before they do so.   Game is essentially unplayable in current form.  If I wanted a tower defense game, I'd buy a tower defense game. "

												AOW 3 is a very addictive turn-based X4 game set in a fantasy world, which  has procedurally generated maps for skirmishes and a few campaigns and scenarios. Each match you'll take command of a faction, defined by your leader's race and class. There are 9 different races and 8 different classes, each very unique, and any combination of them can be formed. Furthermore, you can choose up to 3 specializations for your leader, allowing for a ridiculous amount of possibilities. The game focuses a lot on turn-based combat and exploration, akin to HOMM, but improves upon it on several fronts. Pros:- HUGE number of unique units, heroes and spells- Great fantasy setting- Diplomacy is functional but unnecessary- Combat and game mechanics are easy to grasp, but deep and complex. All this complexity is hidden in a user-friendly interface, so there is no need to panic.- Many treasures to unlock through exploration and combat- Resource structures on your city domain often adds unique, important bonuses to economy or military.- RPG elements such as leader customization and progression through combat experience. Each unit also levels up and may gain new abilities.- Factions are very balanced overall- AI is way above average. Not perfect, but very good compared to other games- The world is beautiful and detailed. Graphics are very good.Cons:- Multiplayer isn't so good. It lacks dynamism.- Higher difficulty AI receives resource bonuses rather than greater skill.- Some elements of the interface could be improved, such as managing your active spells.- Procedural map generators often create odd maps, with several different biomes not spread out in a logical way. You have snow biomes close to tropical ones followed by temperate regions, for instance.- Map editor is pretty complicated to use.9/10			"

												It was a hard decision between this and getting Endless Legend. But I decided to get his and I have to say, I don't feel bad. Endless Legend seems to put more focus into the campign map, which there is nothing wrong with, and I like the way their map is made and layed out into provinces / territories and all of that, but than this game, THIS GAME ROCKS!People complain about it being to balanced, but wtf do you want? One side to totally smash every other side, WELL GUESS WHAT GENIUS? EVERYONE WOULD PICK DWARVES EVERYROUND IF THAT WERE THE CASE! I am glad that the devs decided to balance it out evenly for the factions! I don't want to be a midget after all! No offence to midgets. Instead the game gives you different classes to choose from, so you could an Elven Engineer. Completely unlikely to happen in Dungeons and Dragons but who gives a darn? You can customize your character, heck you can customize the enemy!Also a great feature is the battles, unlike in Civ or any of those games when your army attacks an enemy army you actually control individual units in a kinda like Total War but still Turn Based battle. The map can be customized ALOT. You can even make your own Map / Scenario, AND YOU CAN SCRIPT ANYTHING IN THAT MAP USING LUA! Awesome right?You also have cool units called heros that you can recruit / hire when they pop at your door. Think of like a mix of Mount and Blades / Warcraft / Civilization.The graphics are GREAT for a Turn Based game, the only other two I know of would be Civ V which uses sprites I think and Endless Legend. Endless Legend is more unique story (COMES FROM THE ENDLESS FRANCHISE WHICH EACH GAME FOLLOWS SAME UNIVERSE) and has better campign map but doesnt have battles. Of the three Endless Legend and Age of Wonders from what I can tell are about equally as good depending on your personal preferance. Also to wrap things up I have to mention that lots of people say ""All you do is fight, fight, fight."" Which is true but they are adding a new win condition in a Free DLC or something (Maybe an update) that allows a non PVP victory, even though chances are, you still will go to war at some point. Thats realistic though, cause when have people stopped fighting??So all in all, GREAT GAME! If you disagree please feel free to comment, just don't troll guys.			"

												Just got this game and I don't know who made what first but this is my first time playing a game in the AoW franchise and found it's pretty much the same game as HoMM, although... it's fun. HoMM failed on the fun part their last couple installments and this game delivers. It's a good time. Not to blow my own horn but I think the AI is pretty weak in this, I tried normal difficulty and it was a joke, then 1 up from normal and it still wasn't much of a challlenge. AI would declare war on me, I'd wipe him out without breaking a sweat, I'd try to make peace with the next guy, nope he wants war... he's dead too, etc.Having individual troops in your army rather than stacks of troops like in HoMM is a big improvement. You get more of a feel for how tough your guys are rather than having to always check how big the stack is and do some mental math. Your magic will be strong but not broken and so far I've played 2 classes (Warlord and Sorcerer) and the style of play changes quite a lot so it adds some variety. You get to cast spells both in combat and in the global map and the global spells / disjuction side of the game is very relevant. In combat, your hero can be strong but not that relevant as a fighting unit lategame, but  you'll have spells that make massive impact.As with most TBS games, at the end of the turn the AI helps you control your stuff by prompting you to confirm your orders for your units or give orders to units with none (of course it won't bother you if you ""Garrison"" the units). But it's kinda reduntant, if I give a unit a move order that takes 5 turns to complete, it won't just automove every turn, it will prompt me to confirm his journey for the next 5 turns. Kinda pointless. Another thing I'd like is to be able to have a town governor or something to build my cities up for me without me having to bother with microing it. Late game, I just wanna manage my armies, not click through the repetative build orders of my 20-30 city empire. I would also like a minister of defence or something so he could worry about  sending my troops out to defend my cities, let me pick what goes in the garrison of border cities  and safe zone cities but don't make me do it myself. hehe. Also the builder unit could use some automation, ""go around and make roads to connect my cities"" seems a boring task I shouldn't have to micro myself.Okay enough ranting about my pet peeves, overall the game is great and a welcome addition to the turn based strategy genre.I recommend buying if you like this style of game, there's not many out there that are more fun.

Horray!There are many combinations to see,with races, classes, and a tech tree.You domain reacts to your ways,based on how you play,and it can change quite drastically.There are other countries to fight.Though, I rarely did in my time.There are bands of monsters,resources to earn,and wars just wasted my time.The game is completely turn-based.So at times, it can be slow-paced.There's an overworld map,which is useful as crap,because it changes where battles take place.There are sieges, and battles, and such.You can take your time, or rush.That tech tree does help,as you learn certain spells,Which can change the outcome a bunch.So it's not a Civ clone at all.This game is really a ball.There are so many options,the world is all random,I'd reccomend this game after all.

A turn based strategy that does it's best to capture the feel of Civilization with a couple of added bonuses.  Whenever you get into a battle, you end up in a turn based battle scenario with each of your units crying for attention and wanting to kick some♥♥♥♥♥  While it may seem like a standard ""Click unit, click enemy, repeat"" type of battle method, there are subtle nuances that keep everything in check.  Such as positioning, obstruction for arrows and spells, morale and overall health of a unit that affects their damage output as the battle progresses.  Each race has their own racial bonuses to add to the pile, couple that with your class as well and you have a ton of possibilities as to how your units will fare depending on a situation.  There's enough choice and consequence here to make each game unique.  Speaking of units, let's talk about the big one.  Your hero, head honcho, leader, dictator and ruler of the overworld.  A custom created character (Or pre-made cause you're boring and no one likes you) that can and probably should be your most powerful unit late game.  They are just one of many heroes that you can hire and use to lead your armies, although your hero has the benefit of respawning after several turns if they are killed, unlike hired heroes.  There are a few gripes, such as the low singular army count, as in you can only have 5 units in one army meaning that no battle feels as big as it should without several individual armies backing you up.  The game, at least for me, has a tendency to be bogged down with latency issues.  Clicking and waiting several seconds for the character to pick up on the fact that I'm smacking his or her head in a general direction.  Also, my biggest complaint about the game has to be the multiplayer matchmaking using a P2P (Peer to Peer) network model that requires individual computers to connect to each other.  Understandable from a business perspective, allowing them to shirk off having to run servers, but painfully obnoxious when it comes to the layman just trying to get together with his buds and having to literally turn off his firewall just to connect to anyone. Virus's ho, right? All in all though, the game is generally fun to play if somewhat slower paced than many people are probably hoping for.  The customization of units and the leader of your faction lends to it some sense of personality and attachment as your Orc Dreadnought leads several landships into battle. If you are playing single player, then the mutliplayer connection issues are non-existent.  The latency issues might rear their head even in single play, but being that it's turn based isn't too much of a problem.  If you liked turn based games with RPG mechanics mixed in, you'll like AoW III.			"

												After the incredible AoW2 SM the expectations were very high for this new incoming 3D version. Honestly I was mainly disappointed when the game came out due to the lack of my beloved faction, the undead and for the fact that this game followed the same way of many others with the DLC. Now, with all the DLC is the best fantasy turn based game. Tons of fun, many different strategies.			"

												Although I am still favoring AoW: Shadow Magic because I'm a hardcore Dark Elf and Undead fan, Age of Wonders 3 is by FAR my favorite (or 2nd fav) 4X game of ALL time. It's a lot more eye pleasing, mechancically balanced, deffinitely polished more than previous games, and they brought back the Hero character (like from the 1st AoW) Which I love love love!!!! <3 I just hope they impliment the Necromancer as they said they were going to do.So mostly this game gets 9/10 with me. The overall game is amazing, but wish they didn't merge the Elves/Dark Elves and remove the Undead :P (aka less amount of races was a turn off, but not a game stopper for me) <3 I love you forever Triumph!

												This game is very entertaining. I am mainly writing to respond to criticisms that the game lacks depth, which initially made me hestitant about the game. The sale price of 19.99 USD tipped the scales in favor of the game (I was also considering Solar Empire and Endless Space). I'm glad the sale was going on because so far this is a great purchase. For a pure 4x game, I could see a lack of depth. However, this game is a hybrid between a 4x and RPG. I find RPGs too shallow to hold my interest, but the RPG elements here add a facet to this game that I haven't seen in other 4x games. The fact that it's unique makes it interesting. True...the research tree is anemic, but I have a lot of fun learning the spells, which have a fresh and dynamic affect on every aspect of the gaming experience. But to me, the RPG-style battle engine is what takes this to the next level. It is somewhat complex and very engaging, and mixed with more traditional 4x aspects, AOW III provides a nice experience that has kept my interest through that crucial first 24 hours. It also helps that the gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and the graphics are beautiful. So far, this is my favorite purchase since Civ V. One note is that I did have a crash. However, this was after a 14-hour session.			"

If you haven't, basically it's a 4x fantasy game where you play a powerful mage in command of your chosen fantasy race (dwarves, elves, etc.).  The game is quite fun but I could leave the campaigns at the door.  Sandbox is where it's at.  If you like turn-based games, grab this one.  It's excellent.			"

												6/10. Will probably reinstall eventually. Graphics reign supreme in this remake. I don't much care for the sound but that is typical for me. The game play is quite annoying at times but it is no different than AOW  and AOWII in that sense. Mainly the randomness is what is annoying. That said it is quite playable even with autocombat being terribad. The sameness of the item/skill set does not encourage long games (once you have a complete set of slots you probably don't care about the rest of the dungeons) and the AI is opportunistic (a + thing) but not hard to predict (a - thing). The indicators of how tough a battle will be are frankly disappointing but I have yet to play a game where the predictors were 100%. The fact is, at a certain point you will probably roll over all the Epic, Mythic and Legendary dungeon battles with ease. Full item slots are a must upgrade for this goal. Mainly, it lacks excitement for me but some things about the game are really solid and if I get a hankering for a Warlords style game again I will likely reinstall. I highly recommend playing with your own leader once you figure out how the system works. There is nothing wrong with the stock PCs but they are a little boring. Sadly part of what makes the game lackluster for me is the small variety in the customizable leader abilities. On the other hand every hero you have becomes somewhat customizable once you level them. The points system for doing so seems a little imbalanced and again the variety seems lacking but I expect they withheld a lot of the innovation for DLCs. So you might want to wait for those if you live for diversity. I got the game on sale and for under $8 it is a must buy if you like Warlords style games.			"

												Lots of style, little substance. I've always gravitated towards 4X games, so when Age of Wonders III came out, I was naturally pretty hyped. However, after playing it, there's quite a few flaws I've noticed about the game:- Character customization is extremely limited- Game is a resource hog. My computer's pretty decent and I still got huge lag spikes pretty frequently- It is far, far too easy to steamroll in this game. Once you've captured one city, the rest is just details. - Very, very little variety. A few leader classes and races and that's it. There's not much assortment of monsters, either, even with the expansion. And lastly, the game simply doesn't have any 'soul'. Remember Heroes of Might and Magic III, where each and every artifact had a little story behind it? Or Fall From Heaven 2, where each faction had a long and sordid history? Or even Fallen Enchantress, with a bit of both? Yeah, none of that's here. The game world is pretty much the blandest you could imagine, with a color palette apparently ripped from Fable 2 that just does not jive with the tone the rest of the game tries to set.			"

Seriously, I bought this game shortly after it came out, but put it on a back burner because I had a Hearts of Iron 3 campaign going. AoWIII looked complicated, and it is a steep learning curve. The action bar at the bottom right of the screen helps you take all the actions you can during the turn. The game tells you to research a new skill. It tells you to select what to build in each city, etc. It tells you that an army needs movement orders. Next thing you know, two hours have passed. I give it two thumbs way up.			"

												This game is so fun! If you like kingdom building games or tactical battles this game will be a blast! It has a nice art style to it and a interesting ballance of neautral enemies / quests / and the usual build kingdom to crush enemy thang going on. Although I love this game it does have its short comings as well. Certain unit types are just absurdly unballanced which isn't uncommon in games with alot of factions or races and the neutral enemies can easily distract you from your main goal. That being said it's still very fun and satisfying each and every battle. If your looking for hardcore kingdom building and not a huge fan of tactical battles then mayhaps Endless Legend is better for you, but this game is mostly about the battles.			"

												I am a huge fan of turn-based strategy games and turn-based RPGs. If you like any games that fit that mold, I'd highly recommend Age of Wonders 3. Update: Eternal Lords is an must-have expansion to this game. It adds far more features and greatly improves the core game regardless of the faction/leader/race that you choose. Highly recommended still!One of the critical mistakes that professional reviewers have piled on this game is that they compared this to Civilization 5. I would really disagree with that approach, and I'd recommend that they compare this to Heroes of Might and Magic and/or King's Bounty the Legend. I feel that Age of Wonders 3 gives FAR more replay value and is incredibly well thought out, especially when compared to the sixth entry of the Heroes series. Diplomacy is second-hand, as the majority of the game is built around the excellent tactical combat. Your goal in this game is to win through total-war and that purity of focus does not get old because of the sheer variety of magic, units and scenarios.I have played all of the previous Age of Wonders games, and after having been spoiled by this game (and the Golden Realms expansion), I don't think that I can return to them (despite them being incredible games in their own right!).

												I've been so excited for this ever since I got a whiff of a hint of this title being under development. I've been a massive fan of the AoW series for years.This game does alot of things right, it's beautiful, it flows well, it's easy to pick up, but difficult to master. Just a personal thing for me though that has kind of ruined it...the unit groups. Previous games had single units put together into parties of 8, where anywhere up to 56 units in a single fight, which is epic when playing with friends. True, the battles tended to be rather long in multiplayer, but the single player was thorough pleasure. The shortening of the parties to a limit of 6 has kind of killed the careful planning that I use to enjoy. I know I should judge this game based on it's own value, but since it IS Age of wonders 3, it feels like a step backwards...			"

All in all Very Very imersive!If you are into turn based strategy like Deciples II and Heroes of Might and Magic, then this game is in my top 3 along with Deciples II and H&M, at second place.   Deciples II still takes first because I grew up with it, a personal  choose, but this game has made me nothing but happy and glad I got it. Even if I dont have time to play as much, I got the expansions because want to support the developers. Every developer that gives dev tools to community and adds steam integration on top of a solid game deserves to be supported.   "

												The Age of Wonders title took us to another world called Athla. There wars wages between good and evil and between different Races. Now after several years Age of Wonders 3 has come and gave us a new chapter in the story of Athla. New content added, the stuggle of the races had ended but a new threat has come. New to the title are customizable leaders that can be saved and played through different senarios. A greater AI that will keep you on your toes like never before, Online play should you wish to team up or conqure the world of players. New expancions are added expanding the story and the game play.A great and wonderful dev team that listens to their players and tries to give us what we want.I highly suggest playing this game. I have been following this title since the very beggining and believe this is the best one that they have turned out so far.			"

												After spending about 15 hours on this game, it seems like the perfect mix of Heroes and Civilizations where i've spend thousand of hours. I'm very very intrigued as to what more this game has to offer!More in detail:Its got an improved version of the turn based battle map, whenever ur in combat (attacking or being attacked by an enemy army on the real map, just as in heroes) - making it a up to 3v3 army battle in a variaded ""arena"" specced with obsticals u can implement in ur tactics. As in Civ u place cities in intresting areas, where resource generating tiles are and expand ur cities ""dominion""/area of influence by growing ur city pop (influenced by both what u choose as race etc. and what build in the city.Overall this seems god damn mother f'ing awesome. And i dont say that often!			"

												This game is really good if you like strategy based fantasies games with really decent graphics and just to let you guys out there know that there are several other games out there like this that is similar in nature. The one thing that is a downer is the fact that they changed the downloading stuff of it and made people have to register or reregister just to play a game that shouldn't in the first place require it. However don't let that detur you into getting it. It is a very very good game... Takes a minute to figure out if your not use to it but very decent once you get the hang of it....			"

												I am VERY picky when it comes to liking - or rather: falling in love with - turn based strategy games, but let me tell you this: AoW3 rocks and is one of my all-time favourites. Its' beautiful, full of charm, runs smoothly, has a nice complexity and gameplay depth, great replayability - and most importantly: the developers are very, very nice and open for suggestions.The basic game startet out as a 7/10 for me (I AM picky), but through patches solving a number of gameplay issues and the first expansion easily hit a 9/10. For those of you who do not know, a second expansion is on its way and will be released rather soon. On its way to perfection.Both thumbs up for this one, I could not recommend it more strongly!			"

												This is a great game, combining elements of Warcraft and Heroes of Might and Magic. If you enjoy either or both of these games you'll almost certainly have fun with this one. The missions can be quite long and a little bit repetitive at times, and the storyline is a bit weak, but overall it's a solid game that's engaging and fun to play.			"

												I do not recommend this game to players who just want to enjoy playing a beautifuly made fantasy game, it is beautiful, heck it's  one of the coolest games I have played for a long time. BUT.This game is hard as hell, you will build up a nice city, raise some troops, gather heroes, venture into dungeons and bandit hideouts devestating the enemy. You will feel like someone kinda powerful. But then there is that moment when you meet another faction, concider yourself lucky when that faction want's to live in peace, otherwise they will throw hordes of enemies at your walls and that might just it. And if you had been very busy expanding, expect revolts, civil war and desertions.This only accounts for players who are not really experienced in heavy strategy like me, I know there are ways to be beast at this game but whatever forum entry I've read about it has that one message saying: ""There is only one way to play this game"" and I dont know about you but...I kinda like to play a game the way I want. I will wait for the next DLC and try the new races, but the harshness of this game killed it for me.			"

												Definitely a fun hex-based, turn-based, fantasty,type...thing.A very fun experience overall, although there are some changes which I am not too fond of. Still prefer this series over the Heroes and Might and Magic series. A. Combat. the combat is great in that you still have the massive amount of soldiers all fighting each other with individual abilities and stats. The cons (for me) are that: range attacks seem to have been simplified, at long ranges your shots plain out do less damage, when there is obstructions the damage goes down. I have yet to experience a missed attack or an attack hitting a unit or object obstructing the projectile path. Another thing is that the game has switched from the old squad of single units (like a party of heroes almost) to every unit being a small group of units in civ, this appears to be mostly visual and does affect the damage too much when most of that unit/group dies but I don't like it (although that's just my problem and probably doesn't bother anyone else). Debuffs are almost a necessity because there are some units you will come across that are just plain out overpowered (one unit in the game can pretty much kill off an entire party of units in one hit). All hero units have individual skillsets now, items are nice (flying mounts and rare mounts look amazing). B. Civ management. Civs are pretty simple as always, build cities, simple buildings and tile management is non-existent, just get it into your border and it's yours. The Magic research tree is now the overall tech tree, this means you make the choice between researching tech upgrades and researching new spells, odd but it works since the older games only really had you research a few key spells and then not care about the rest. C. Visuals/Audio. Everything looks great, background tracks are amazing. D. Story, it's alright from what I've seen but it's not the most captivating experience. It makes everything a bit more interesting but the campaigns are more of a do this objective because reasons, rather than getting you motivated by the story.			"

												old --- // I'll finish the review when I can actually play the game.  Someday, game developers will recall the original point of steam was to provide copy protection to developers and a convenient store front for gamers, and *stop mucking with it* by adding in an extra layer of copy protection, invariably on games nobody wants to copy because it's already niche anyway.Devs, you are better off letting people steal your game than creating ill will in the people who actually buy your stuff. Ok, so what it does is require an account separate from the steam account to get created, then it kind of fakes you out by indicating that you have to register product keys, when you don't.  There is lag in the process, so you will think you are being blocked by not having registered those keys, when really it's just server lag.I've played a few hours on the game so far, and it reminds me a lot like the original AoW, plus a little Heroes of Might & Magic thrown in, which is a good thing.  The game has been quite fun so far. //This is an amazing game.  Clearly, I spent more than four hundred hours playing it.			"

												You know how in most fantasy games the lore of the world consists of truly grand historical events, and yet they are often told through exposition dumps and feel completely abstract and irrelevant? Well, in Age of Wonders 3 history happens here and now, and you are the one making it.Don't expect it to be a 4X game though, it's much more similar to Heroes of Might and Magic III or even King's Bounty. The game takes place on separate maps (pre-designed, randomly generated or user-created) and the story campaigns are focused on individual characters and their heroic exploits. Expect to fight a lot, because combat is the meat of this game. It's incredibly deep, with dozens (probably hundreds) of units, spells, abilities and synnergies between them. But what makes it really special is how magic works. I think this game might have every type of spell ever conceived by a fantasy author. Seriously. Making too much mana and not enough gold? Cast a persistent spell that literally makes it rain money upon your city. Having trouble sieging an outpost with stone walls? Cast some climbing vines that will slowly corrode them turn by turn. Or maybe just infest the city with a plague of insects. You can summon entire armies of gargantuan creatures instead of producing units the old-fashioned way. It's ridiculous. There's a crazy amount of possibilities. And then there's two expansions, both of which probably have more content than the entire Heroes VII. And then there are mods.However, most of these things you will have to find out for yourself. The tutorial doesn't do a good job of explaining core mechanics of the game. And while experimenting with magic and army compositions is great fun, some aspects of empire management could have been explained a bit better.So if you're looking for a standard 4X game, you won't find it here. But if you're looking for deep tactical combat, powerful spells and fantasy adventures, this is one of the most impressive strategy games to come out in recent years.			"

												The 4th Age of Wonders is awesome. A gorgeous Fantasy 4X - Hex-grid world much like ""Civilisation 5"" but with ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" combat (except heros participate & units don't weaken, they are full strength until dead). So AOW3 is also similar to ""Warlock:Master of the Arcane"" 1 & 2, except for the combat of course, also AOW3 has more depth. Pro- Great graphics- great unit variety including evil penguins and other strange units- variety of spells & status effects- you don't skip battles because they are fun- editor- several unit stacks joining for bigger battles- Veterans of 4X and TBS will love AOW3- hero leveling, items and the different mounts (with models)- diplomacy - a basic system but it does have oneCon- City/Empire management needs improving: I wish AOW3 had the steamline features of Civilisations 4 & 5 (eg, next town button or an AI City manager)- City management is not complex unlike rest of the game and the genre.- doesn't explain all concepts.- enemy sniping your heroes for instant Game Fail is really annoying - use care and save scum.- just one more turn....- AOW3's ""civ-o-pedia"" is good but it is no civ-o-pedia.AOW3 will blow away Sid Meier's Civilisations with a good expansion pack.

You can enjoy a lot of the game even after you finished the main campaigns, since the custom match can create totally unique games. Because there is a lot of combinations of Classes and Racest to choose from both for your leader and the enemies leaders; besides all map configurations.Also after you are done with the official content (which took me about 1000 hours), there is a loooot fun mods to play.Score: 10/10			"

												A very, very pretty game with a great deal of potential. However, it has a lot of the same flaws as Civ 5 before the three expansions to fix them. Diplomacy options are non-existent or straight bad and late game fighting (which is the only option) is a slog. However, the turn-based combat system really rewards smart, tactical play and the available units are inventive, diverse and interesting. With a few additions to late game versatility, AoW 3 could really be a 4X contender.			"

												I would recommend for fans of the series or genre and I did enjoy discovering what this game had to offer. However, I did find the game quite shallow once I started to reach the peak of what was available. Almost everything is limited in scope from the cities buildings to the troops that can be fielded. There is slight difference between races to choose from and those units can be acquired during playthroughs making the only major decision is the type of leader you'll be.The graphics are great, the turn based maps have plently to explore and the HoMM tactical combat is fun until it becomes a tier 4 spam fest.I don't regret my purchase as I enjoy these kind of games but I don't see AoW3 competing for my freetime again.

												I had a lot of hope for this game. I had a lot of disapointment with this game. Everything in the game is at best ""ok"". There is no real progression tree telling you what you need to research to get what, or how far through the research you were. The range on ranged weapons is ridiculously small and the penalty for the range was even more ridiculous. Apparently no one on the development team has ever spoken with or researched historical bow range increments.The melee combat is pretty stupid with the implementation of flanking. Apparently if an enemy is approaching you, and outside of one step away, your unit would never think to watch them closing in on you, and thus should be be able to annhialate you. If you were actively engaged with an enemy, this makes sense. When you aren't engaged? The development team shows just as much initiative in considering melee combat as they did with ranged.The magic use in tactical and strategic combat ranges from flavorless to boring to pointless. There are uses for magic other than nailing a ranged attack on an enemy, but most of them are not any more effective, so there isn't a point in doing so most of the time. The replayability factor in this game is non-existant. It's not a terrible game, it's just not engaging, exciting, or really entertaining. It's blah in practically every way, and a huge disapointment.			"

												Don't waste your time if you have any interest in city building.  The only way to succeed in AoW3 is to rush at the first turn.  There is no economy, there is no cultural development, and there is no questing with your hero characters.  This game is all about zerging with Tier 1 units.  If you choose to spend time developing your cities, prepared to be overwhelmed by your 3-4 enemy NPCs (not counting Independent colonies).  Choose to defend your city?  That's a waste of your time.I really tried hard to like this game, but I couldn't do it.  This is not turn-based strategy, it is a zerg fest plain and simple.			"

												AOW 3 is a very addictive turn-based X4 game set in a fantasy world, which  has procedurally generated maps for skirmishes and a few campaigns and scenarios. Each match you'll take command of a faction, defined by your leader's race and class. There are 9 different races and 8 different classes, each very unique, and any combination of them can be formed. Furthermore, you can choose up to 3 specializations for your leader, allowing for a ridiculous amount of possibilities. The game focuses a lot on turn-based combat and exploration, akin to HOMM, but improves upon it on several fronts. Pros:- HUGE number of unique units, heroes and spells- Great fantasy setting- Diplomacy is functional but unnecessary- Combat and game mechanics are easy to grasp, but deep and complex. All this complexity is hidden in a user-friendly interface, so there is no need to panic.- Many treasures to unlock through exploration and combat- Resource structures on your city domain often adds unique, important bonuses to economy or military.- RPG elements such as leader customization and progression through combat experience. Each unit also levels up and may gain new abilities.- Factions are very balanced overall- AI is way above average. Not perfect, but very good compared to other games- The world is beautiful and detailed. Graphics are very good.Cons:- Multiplayer isn't so good. It lacks dynamism.- Higher difficulty AI receives resource bonuses rather than greater skill.- Some elements of the interface could be improved, such as managing your active spells.- Procedural map generators often create odd maps, with several different biomes not spread out in a logical way. You have snow biomes close to tropical ones followed by temperate regions, for instance.- Map editor is pretty complicated to use.9/10			"

												Great game. I have lots of experience with turn based strategies of all flavors, and this one holds up. Since a lot of great reviews are out there, I'll just reaffirm the ones that state this game focuses more on action and less on managemet. The city management system is fairly shallow, but deep enough to keep it interesting. The combat however is superb and the level of detail for both character design and animation is just astounding. The reverse of Endless Legend, which is much deeper with management but a fairly shallow combat system.I do love the AoW3 campaign though, great concept incorporating single player RPG's into a turn based strategy sim, I dig it.If you like turn based games and fantasy, there's no way you can't like this game. It might not blow your socks off, but it is more than worth its asking price (especially if on sale). Highly recommended.8.5/10  would command troll army again			"

You can also directly control your heroes and use them in battles.What I really love is strategic element - your empire will be soon quite big and even several lost battles doesn't mean lost game. It feels a bit like a combination of Heroes and Civilization - if you like this games, definitely get it.			"

												This is my second time writing a review of this game. When it first came out it was horribly unbalanced and the AI cheesed hardcore to compensate for poor AI. I don't notice any AI improvement, and the high level unit spam continues still, although everyone said it was fixed. The AI does have its moments, in tactical combat the cannons line up shots nicley, for example. I was able to progress since the big update, but the AI spam, makes the game repetitive and tedious.The graphics are good, music is ok, not as good as past games. The game feels a bit slow and clunky, but my machine is a few years old. The single player game offers challenge to the seasoned AoW player. Players new to the genre will suffer. This game still does suffer from a common issue; easy is too easy and normal is too hard. The AI starts off with much more resouses you have and sends high level armies to attack you non stop, eventually you can just find your self in dead end games where you basically have to give up and start over. Setting the difficulty down is no solution as easy is no challenge and no fun. Ultimately, I’m mildy satisfied. Worth a play if you have nothing better to do and a lot of patience. 4/10			"

I've acclimatised through time to Shadow Magic and the Throne etc etc but, while I was excited about the release of AOW3, I was also skeptical, and rightly so. This game is basically exactly like Warlock. I'm very disappointed in it, I can't find a single Age of Wonders feature at all.

												I whole-heartedly recommend Age of Wonders III to everyone who likes turn-based strategy.It is a sequel to a game series that manages to hit that sweet spot every sequel wants to hit: To introduce enough new content and mechanics to be its own game, while managing to keep up the feeling of the original.And it's just as addicting, too. You can play either via network (Internet or local), or the good old hot-seat mode. Just remember to ask your friends to bring a sleeping bag when starting a hotseat game on a huge map, because you might be busy for a week. There are campaigns of different difficulty for a smooth learning curve, and they also provide you with an interesting story in which your choices matter (Not every choice, of course, but there are points where you can choose which direction the story takes).The game is a good way to start with TBS games, not only because of the good tutorial provided by the first campaign map, but also the helpful UI. At the beginning of your turn, it shows you everything that happened as messages on the side of the screen, and provides you with a button that tells you which issue to deal with next. That might be considered a bit mothering, but it certainly helps to prevent you from forgetting to order a new building in one of your cities, which can easily slip your mind in an empire of twenty metropolises.There are a few things that I have issue with, most notably some balance choices, but the devs are active, and listening to the community, so that will only improve over time. As long as there's people willing to buy the game, they will continue to deliver, and not only small balance patches, but also large dlcs with new factions, classes and campaigns.			"

												This game had a decent number of positive elements, but the way that the army with initiative (faction currently playing its turn) can exploit and manipulate the combat initiation to engage only part of an enemy force (and wipe it out with force of numbers) was a terrible deal-breaker for me. I might have been able to avoid exploiting this mechanic myself, and try to get more fun out of the game, but the AI was trained to exploit it, too. *shakes head* Since the AI had to be coded to do that, this is apparently what passes for ""strategy"" in this title.

												For all the hex-grid 4X lovers out there, this game is for you.Think of Civilization 5 with a fantasy theme but add RPG stats and skills to your civ's leader, then they become a controllable hero unit on the map, AND units can stack into armies.THEN whenever you fight in combat, zoom in to an expanded version of the hex on the map, and its a-whole-nother hex grid to fight over complete with varying terrain, elevation, climate, and occasionally besieging a city or fort's walls!And then there's the massive depth to each unit. Not just the heroes, but each individual military unit will have their own RPG-style stats with strengths and weaknesses and even crazier promotions than you could possibly imagine (my favorite so far is getting a flying, flame-breathing dragon mount for my leader and handing the horse off to another general)In the war of 4X, I've seen a lot of games rise to the occasion, and a lot more of them fall flat but this one takes the cake.

												By far one of the best x4 strategy games out there within 2014 releases.It's storyline gives an offer for new comers and veterans to pursue two different storylines which additional DLC for more, not to mention the steam workshop which is relentlessly bringing out more and more content for fans.The gameplay is superior to any x4 strategy games I have come across in recent times. It takes the Might and Magic fans to a whole new level. Taking bits and pieces from other genre releases and developing it into this fine game.In-house level system, for heroes, army combatants and spells. Along with city wide development.The AI is good however at times can be a little predictable after the 20-30 hour mark of playing - but overall a very solid platform for repeatability and coming back to play the game.8 and a half Unicorns and out of 10			"

Let me preface this review by saying that I don't have a lot of experience in this genre outside of the civilization series which I have played since Civ 3.With that said, I absolutely love and adore this game. In short;Pros; Great gameplay. High replayability. Very interesting tactical combat. Very good MP. Easy to get into. A -lot- of customization. Fantastic graphics and beautiful music.Cons; Can turn out to have very long games. Unfortunately not that many people in MP. A lacking tutorial. And the AI is relatively easy.Age of Wonders, in a nutshell, is a series that combines the best aspects of a Civilization game, with the best aspects of a fantasy RPG, in the same vein as games like Dominions or Might & Magic. Great empire management combined with a deep and complex tactical combat system makes this game a must have for fans of Heroes of Might and Magic and Fallen Enchantress or Warlock. It stands out in portraying a highly detailed and breathing fantasy world, it's lethal and thrilling combat and enchanting music score. The sheer number of units, abilities, spells and maps (thanks to a random map generator) makes this a game that will be played for years, decades.And there is just so much to do each turn in this game, so many armies to manage and cities to build. The gorgeous world is waiting to be explored and the various monsters are ready to do battle. All of this is paired with truly wonderful tactical combat. There are just so many different ways to approach combat that it's dizzying.I would recommend this game to anyone. If you're a fan of the series, definitely check it out. If you're not a fan, go ahead and check it out anyway.			"

												Don't waste your time if you have any interest in city building.  The only way to succeed in AoW3 is to rush at the first turn.  There is no economy, there is no cultural development, and there is no questing with your hero characters.  This game is all about zerging with Tier 1 units.  If you choose to spend time developing your cities, prepared to be overwhelmed by your 3-4 enemy NPCs (not counting Independent colonies).  Choose to defend your city?  That's a waste of your time.I really tried hard to like this game, but I couldn't do it.  This is not turn-based strategy, it is a zerg fest plain and simple.			"

												A game with great ideas and competent design, but broken by simple details that shouldn't ever be this much of a problem. I'll say first that I haven't played this game a lot.  I played on a couple of maps and some of the campaign but even in that time I saw virtually everything I needed to see.  The game is fantastically designed in terms of artwork, battle system and even map design.  My first impression was extremely good.  Unfortunately, it all falls apart due to basic things like unit variety, balancing and pacing.  The devs did such a terrible job designing, differentiating and balancing their units that all the things the game does right ends up being worthless.  High tier units are way too easy to acquire, cost way too little, and are soooo much better than all of the lower tier units that you never want to/should build anything else than full stacks of whatever your faction's T4 unit is.  It's dumb and it would be so easy to fix.  That makes it all the more frustrating.			"

												Pros:#1. There wasn't $60 worth of DLC at launch.#2. There is no PaytoWin Scheme.. you buy the game you get all of it! (Except... for #3)#3. DLC, yes there is DLC.. but the good kind!! AoW3 is STILL working on their game, their last update was 5 days from this post. They release new items/classes/races/spells/heroes and more with each DLC. So you're paying for expansion like DLC, not skins or in game currency or some random♥♥♥♥♥♥#4. Triumph Studies has a long history of not ♥♥♥♥ing up their sequels. AoW1 & 2 are both great games- and this is one of the few games where it's still getting better and not just a complete copy/paste of its predecessors.#5. They like their community. Examples would include Dev's replying to forum posts, not deleting them and free holiday gifts. They also actively search for new hires and are willing to take in fans as interns.#6. The game as a great community!Cons:#1. The AI cheats sometimes- If I move an army off a base- even if he has no visibility there he instantly knows I moved. In other words it seems like they have no FOG of War.#2. Halfling Theocrats... For ♥♥♥♥s sake man.. of all the combinations of enemies this is to be feared the most. It's just.. just.. I don't wanna talk about it anymore .. ;(			"

												I'm saying no for two reasons: cost and depth, but take out the cost issue and I say yes.AoW II is a pretty fun game.  It's your good 'ol 4x with no twists.  It has just enough customizability in it to make it warm n fuzzy. It does have any real crazy bug issues and It's pretty enough.Maybe that's why I'm so meh about this game?  It meets just ""enough"" of an expectation that I can't really call it out on anything.  But then there is the combat which is fun.  It has some real tactical depth to it, but even then... well... the game gives you the option to just let it run the combat... which it does very effectively... so after a while I just stopped running the combats and just auto-ran all of em.I think the biggest and most actual criticism I have (after the cost fo the game of course) is that there is no real depth to a long game.  For example, Civ 5 or even Fallen Enchantress have some crazy crazy deep game to them.  Civ 5 is just long.  By the time you get to the end of the tech tree the outcome of the game has usually been decided because you're usually playing against a difficulty rating... not a civ.  In Fallen Enchantress there is an entirely ""other level"" of deep game based on♥♥♥♥♥♥that's out in the world that is so ♥♥♥♥ing hard to kill or overcome that you have to be scared of those places or creatures because if you aren't, then they will ♥♥♥♥ing ruin you.  Imagine monsters walking around the world that don't necessarily care that you're there until you get in their way... like the Spirit of the Forest in Princess Mononoke.  Litterally gods walking about the world.  You have to gear up and prepair to even make an attempt on something like that... and it takes a while... and it leaves you with a sense of accomplishment when finally completed.  AoW II has no ""other level"" of scary in it and certainly no depth of field for it's AI.  At least with CIV 5 there are differences in HOW the different civilizations will approach destroying you.  In AoW II it's like being swarmed by a hoard of really angry bees.  Why are they attacking you?  No ♥♥♥♥ing reason at all... they just ARE.So that's that.  Would this game get a thumbs up if it were MORE interesting in a lot of it's aspects than just ""enough"" depth of customization or just ""enough"" of 4x or if it's different civilizations weren't exactly the same just named differently?  Yes.  And I feel like the makers of this game knew they were making a game that was, in fact, only just ""enough""... that's why it's $40 rather than $50 or $60.  In the end it's a shallow and pretty game with some decent music that costs too much.  Buy it when it's on sale.			"

												As an old fan of Master of Magic, Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic and the Fall From Heaven Civ4-mod, my hope when purchasing this was that it would replace the current game, my small group of hardcore ""slow"" strategy gamers played against eachother. Especially the promise that a Play by Email function would be included, made all of us pre-buy it before it came out.So what did we get?We got an absolutely stunning turn-based game, that takes a lot of the best that all games before it had. It has this feeling of immersion that makes you want to play again and again.Notice that I say ""a lot of the best"", because it is not perfect... Yet. I'll tell you a bit about why it will be.Multi-player.The online multiplayer is easy and very solid, compared to most other games. Of course, since it takes a lot of time to play a Age of Wonders III game, having several people being connected for days will eventually experience drop-outs. Getting back up unfortunately requires a full re-load and reconnect, but nothing is lost when it happens.Triumph has been promising us a Play be Email function since before the game came out, and it should be very close to release. When it does, multi-player games will explode in number. And to top it off, Triumph has already described some details that might make this the easiest to use PBEM function ever. You always have problems with who has the turn, but Triumph might be able to fix that problem, which I believe would be first and best in gaming history. It would be... Perfect.Tactical combatNot much to say. It has never been done better. Every tactical battle can be approached differently, and the troops you bring to the combat changes everything. Oh, and sound and video is beautiful and interesting. AOWIII tactical is just... Perfect.Depth and contentWhen the game released, although it was beautiful and the engine worked very well, felt like a dumbed-down version of AOW: Shadow Magic. Fewer races, the items on the map felt the same, and every game played more or less the same with an off-balanced strategy, that could win all games, so everyone did just that. But it's Triumph, guys!: For every patch, DLC, upgrade and whatever they decide to call it, the game has become richer and funnier to play. The new game function of having treasure sites making specific troops types better (like a mithril source in Master of Magic) makes every city a possible specialist city to be nurtured and defended. With new races, classes, treasure huts, and stuff springing up continually, this game seems like a friendship that grows for every expansion. With the ideas already on Triumphs existing idea list, when it comes to depth and content, all these guys have to do is show up for work, and this game will be... Perfect.ReplaybilityLet's face it. Every game gets old at some point. Only a few games stand out and goes into history as ""the game we played for ages"". What was it that made Shadow Magic better than AOW vanilla, Fall from Heaven better than Civ 4 vanilla? Every game played out differently. Why is it that most people only plays CIV5 and CIV:Beyond Earth for a few weeks and then move on? Because every game basically plays out the same. AOWIII is at risk here. The classes of AOWIII is the distinguishing part that does not make every game bland, but will it be enough? Fall from Heaven changed CIV4 with the interesting notion of going from ""research everything"" to ""You can only afford one way through the research tree, so choose the path that plays well with what you have found in this particular game"". And it changed everything. The research tree of AOWIII has few differences based on magical affinity, but a Tier II summon basically does the same, cost the same, and appear at the same time. There's not that much strategy, and you will typically choose the same spell strategy every time. Cities are almost entirely the same, races don't alter things much. A bit has already been done there, giving the races racial traits. For instance, the bard is equipped with a bow. But a High Elf Bard now has a Longbow, which makes all the difference. But the other races? It's much the same. All cities function, all cities gives basically the same amount of resources. In Shadow Magic, I found myself changing populations several times a game: Only two races could grow the essential crops in shadow world, so better make it one of those. Some races had alignments that made them impossible to hold unless you did something, Cities could be physically moved away from a lost area, if you repopulated it with nomads. Elf cities hid themselves behind trees. You had choices. In AOWIII every race will join you without too much trouble and the cities are basically the same. Alignment doesn't really play a role, although the mechanic is there.The general feeling is a well-known one: The new school game developers are scared about alienating the impatient youths that nothing in the game must be frustrating. Only problem is, turnbased games are too slow to hold impatient players anyways, so trying to cater for everyone just makes the game bland, instead of making possibilities soar. If you have ever played 100+ multiplayer rounds of the same game, you know that when you stop being able to surprise your opponents, you are ready to move on.If, however, the developers should go all in on making things feel... different... then this game already has everything needed in place. In fact, with increased replayability, some of it already in the pipeline, this game has the potential to go from great to... absolutely perfect.I absolutely recommend this game to every turn-based strategy gamer out there.

												This game is pretty underwhelming.  It seems like it could offer a decent amount of gameplay - time wise - but I'm finding it quite stale and uninspiring.  It certainly doesn't give a person that ""just one more turn"" type of feeling.If you enjoyed Heroes of Might and Magic you will probably enjoy this game ( I know there's probably countless comparisons in these review pages, but it's true, it's a HoMM clone just with more utility and production from your towns). Think of it as HoMM meets Civ: combat and exploration, and even the way your hero is presented, is total HoMM, but in this game you get the choice of where to place your towns and manage your production.  Your heroes also are bit more customizable in terms of spell research and how to spend upgrade points.And it's unnecessarily challenging too.  I set it to easy just so I could breeze through, explore the story, and get a feel for it, but the fights usually result in large casualties.  This forces you to stay still and keep building/replenishing your forces.  Then, while you're at the front lines - holding what you THINK is a choke point - the enemy will come down the river, flank you, overwhelm the defenses and take out your capital, forcing you to march aaaaalll the way back to face them, during which time they conquer your choke point and whatever else they can get before you counter attack that too.  In short: production has to be a unit spam/zerg for either saturated defenses or replenishing offense.But really, overall, a game should be FUN above all else and I find this game is just really....""meh"".  I'm probably going to play through it all - eventually - but only when I'm super bored.  It's going to be sitting on my desktop for awhile.  Glad I only paid $13 for it.  There's (probably) a lot of game time value, but I'm certainly not finding it to have entertainment value.3/10			"

												I had hopes for this game and did some homework on it to try to determine if it was worth paying full retail, and turns out it isn't. Graphically the game looks fine. I'm not one to gush about graphics; gameplay is king for me. The game also seemed to run o.k.The main issue I seem to be having is the tactical combat. Just a few niggly bits jump out immediately and, frankly, I don't want to keep playing. This is quite disappointing.You start combats just a few steps from the edge of the map, making tactical retreats nearly impossible. Pretty much every engagement is only a simple turn or two away from melee. This nearly nullifies missile unit's tactical options. Since you are fairly limited on number of units to begin with, this is pretty major.Balance seems off. As an example, I ganged up on an assasin unit that is seen in the second battle of the starter campaign. I whittled the unit down to a single health point of 36 (1/36). Next turn, the unit assassinated my hero, and the game was over. Second turn into an easy game. I can see this being a selling point for many but turns out that you should be managing unique saves of every turn unless you want to replay the last several turns since the last save every time some game balance issue results in the end of the game.Why not just use the auto save? Because during the same game, I had a full stack placed on my second town and my main army was marching. Suddenly a two stack attack landed on my town. Defeat, with the death of a hero that must survive. Game over on easy for the second time in 30 minutes. Auto save has my other army more than a turn away and unable to help. So, I must revert to a previous save and replay several battles and tutorial elements.The game is o.k., or would be if it was priced like and indie title at about $10 or $15. But for $40 I don't think the balance is there. Perhaps some of my concerns will be addressed. Perhaps it's just not for me. Either way, I felt compelled to share my thoughts.			"

												This is my second time writing a review of this game. When it first came out it was horribly unbalanced and the AI cheesed hardcore to compensate for poor AI. I don't notice any AI improvement, and the high level unit spam continues still, although everyone said it was fixed. The AI does have its moments, in tactical combat the cannons line up shots nicley, for example. I was able to progress since the big update, but the AI spam, makes the game repetitive and tedious.The graphics are good, music is ok, not as good as past games. The game feels a bit slow and clunky, but my machine is a few years old. The single player game offers challenge to the seasoned AoW player. Players new to the genre will suffer. This game still does suffer from a common issue; easy is too easy and normal is too hard. The AI starts off with much more resouses you have and sends high level armies to attack you non stop, eventually you can just find your self in dead end games where you basically have to give up and start over. Setting the difficulty down is no solution as easy is no challenge and no fun. Ultimately, I’m mildy satisfied. Worth a play if you have nothing better to do and a lot of patience. 4/10			"

												Just as I thought it's once again too HERO centric. If you lose your good hero it's all over might as well start over. Just put upgrade points into defense, hit points and melee strength and you wash all the other units off the map. Glad I waited until this POC was $13.59 I would have felt a waste of money at full retail price.Basically if you have just about any other 4x Fantasy strategy game even their Shadow Magic game you've pretty much got this one as well. Master of Magic is still the best and most fun. This just feels too much like a clone remake and should have been some DLC for another game.EDIT: Just as I suspected they are going to milk the donkey selling extra races in this game. Man if that ain't♥♥♥♥♥♥pitiful. Of course they kept out the best race next to the death race itself. The Necromancers. Watch the DEATH race will be next and probably $19.99 by itself lol			"

												It just feels way more as an adventure rather than as a strategy game. You just go from battle to battle following the game script and leveling up until you cover the entire map. There is really no way to loose unless you want to, despite the difficulty level.If adventure is your thing than go for it. Just don’t expect a lot of thinking involved for this one.			"

												Almost a good game. I wanted the game to be better than it is. Needs some refinement to be really a good game. Lacks a personnel connection with your empire once the charicter creation is complete. It is like starting a fantasy Civ with a custom charecter (which was awesome) but the game play and interaction with the opposing players was absent. The game became tedious and uninteresting as turns progressed throughtout the game.			"

												After playing a couple of games and experimenting with different settings, I have to say that I think the game is underwhelming.What I like:+ There is a good amount of diversity of creatures, abilities, hero types, etc.+ There are cool things to do on the map, things to explore and fight.+ Tactical combat is pretty decent.What I dislike:- The AI. The tactical AI is semi-competent, I guess, but still underwhelming. The other faction AI players are probably the most disappointing. When you are ahead, it does not seem to be maneuvering in any real fashion to bring you down a notch. Before you get ahead it is not trying to keep you down.- There seems to be little or now catch up mechanics (at least not for the AI). Once ahead, you're snowballing out of control fast.I haven't played against other players, so I cannot comment on that aspect of the game.Addenum: I will play some more random maps and use different victory conditions than ""Allied Victory"" and see if that helps...

												Its a shame this game has so many problems. It's like Civilization except fantasy. But the units are all very unbalanced, the campaign difficulty is absurd at times, and while the tactical turn based battle are a nice concept, it's not done well at all. Too often, open field battles are way too easy, and on the opposite end siege battles are way too hard. You'll often lose whole armies to a handful of defenders in the campaign because they have one or two uber upper tiered units with some dumb ability that will flat out erradicate your army.Heroes have spells which are spammable to no end, especially if you constantly tech up your mana and spell pools. AI will of course go out of their way to mess with you, attacking undefended locations that they should theoretically not even know exist, a surefire sign of a cheating AI.Many times when you win, you'll feel it was undeserved, and when you lose, you'll feel cheated by a game seemingly not playing by its own rules.If you're a Civilization styled Strategy fanatic, yeah you might like it. But if you're like me and like these types of games to relax, this game caused me way too much stress during my relaxation time for me to reccomend it. Buy it on sale if at all.			"

												This game deserves a thumbs up for being a fun strategy based game. Very well thought out. Storyline is great and so are the graphics. Highly recommend as a single player game.However, I had every intention to play this game as coop. That's where the thumbs down comes into play.  Even with good connection...we were unable to host our own server using multi-player mode. And there are really not a lot of servers to join. Most are password protected. The ones that aren't, which I have to say are very few...with more then 2 people playing on the server tends to get very laggy. So until the game makers fix this issue, I wouldn't rely on this game being multi-player.  But playing solo. I still do recommend.			"

												as a long time fan of the series (playing all 4 of the games, counting shadow magic) I have to say when i heard that they were reviving my favorite stragegy game series (civ very close behind) i was stoked, and it looked cool but when i saw the trailers i knew this would be a big big ♥♥♥♥up. i love these games to death but Aoe3 is a failure. The game only has basic remnents of the past games feeling like a whole new game from a different series, and while alot of ppl like the fact that its similar to the new strategy games, and is way different than the others, but its not good. or better not even close, i would rate all the others ones 8-9-10s (not in any order but Shadow magic was my fav). The fact that this game is basically a copy of civ 5 hurts alot. While i love civ 5 this is not the game that i would play. In fact i just wouldnt play this game. The devs took 30 steps back this this ""forward title"" this game is more shallow than any strat game ive ever played, the fantasy that was so amazing in the others, just isnt here, the units are dull and boring, the combat is a mess from the much simpler old style (from you guessed it, the predicessors), and the leaders are dull and boring, none of them have charater like they did in the last game. Its just a joke. final verdict is a 6/10 its playable but its not good, if you want a fantasy strat game i suggest endless legend, this is a worse endless legend  with civ 5 in the mixing pan. if your a fan of the old games im sorry your not gonna find it in this mess of a game. no story, no depth no fun. Yea im sad too Rest in Peace Age of Wonders, you filled me with so much joy and love, it was great while it lasted peace guys			"

The combat pace is very slow, so most battles are just 'auto' as fighting the battle just feels tedious. As a grand strategy, It doesn't do it as well as Civ 5 - so a fantasy mod on Civ 5 would give better gameplay. As an RPG - its very shallow - so there's not much depth in that area either.Overall.. The game was just bland and a little too slow for my taste.			"

The problem is the full game actually costs at the moment 45$ + 13$ + 8$ + likely another 13$ for the upcoming dlc and then who knows what else for every other DLC they come out with. The final price of the game will likely be 100$  or more and this game is not worth 100$. If youre looking for a good game right now, civ 5 and all its DLC is less than the base game of age of wonders 3. What I suggest for any game like this is to buy it when all its dlc is out and there is a massive sale on. Only then is it worth it as no game out at the moment is worth $100+......			"

Get it if you ever see it on sales! totally worth the buck!Note : if you hate turn based games, avoid it... if you're a huge turn based game lover.. this game will be very addictive.

Sadly, that means that it is terrible in multiplayer, as you're forced to watch or wait for _any_ other player to finish their combat before you're allowed to interact with your game. Combat can be slow. Simultaneous combat is not allowed. So don't buy if it's for multi, but single is great.			"

												Tatical Combat is the worst i ever seen in a Turn-based Strategy game!When someone try to tell you that this game has a nice tatical combat system, than he is a turn-based-strategy noob or just a god damn liar!The units in an army don't have any initative, instead all units in one army make there move! So you can move your whole units before the enemy is able to do anything...When you are finished then it is the enemys armys turn... And guess what... he also can move all his troops in one turn. And then its your turn again... and so on...The first army that will get in range of the enemy army will be completly crushed by the other army, because the other army can attack the first army with all of it troops, before the first army get a chance to fight back...WHAT A F***ING JOKE!I don't know which dev had the idea to implement such a poor tatical combat system, but from my point of view it is a completly gamebreaking mechanism. And i never has seen such a bad combat system in over 20 years of playing turn-based strategies!If you got game like heroes of might and magic or fallen enchantress just stay with them.They have a alot better tatical combat design than this pile of BS.Beside from that, the controls and handling mechanism of the game is not very polished and a little bit anoying.If you really want this game than wait till it cost 5-10 bucks and don't make the same mistake like i did by wasting 20 bucks in it.

After a rather steep learning curve this game has a lot to offer. Diverse troops, different play styles, spells, and a unique experience every game for the most part. So far all but 1 of my games ended in losing all my troops to a tiny army I should have decimated 3 times over, or getting trampled under a never ending army. My 6 tropps would either lose to 2 minor enemies for no reason, or they would destroy 25 armies only to see 50 more marching down the road early in the game.

												This game.. oh boi it takes me back when i was still 7 or 9 years old. I remember it was a great game when i played the very first AOW with my dad but after all this years now finding out that this game has been advanced forward i enjoy it each time i play new maps even playing with my dad. If you still remember the good ol AOW 1 or you just like the games that involves strategy, magic, fantasy and so on, i defenetly recommend this game to you. I can assure you that you will love this game with your heart. Plus DLC's are also making game more fun too.			"

												So far, this game is a treat. Combined with some of its expansions and balancing mods (all available on Steam), the possibilities for interesting gameplay are vast, both tactically and strategically. It's easy to learn and hard to master, so I recommend practicing your strategies on lower difficulties before diving into hardcore war gaming. I know I'm going to put a lot more hours into this game, there's just so much to see and do.			"

												I have never played AOW1+2 and i am not a fantasy worlds fan, but i think AOW3 is a very good game.Very nice graphics and music, a polished game with good strategy.I have played 2 medium difficulty level games until now and the AI won both of them. I don't know the game various units and spells very well yet, i must keep on playing and improve my fantasy world strategy.Having very little experience with fantasy worlds, i can say that maybe the ""lore"" is not so good, but the actual gameplay, the strategy and the mood are very good. It looks a bit like the Civilization games (i have played Civ4+5), but i think it's very different.I really recommend it, the first expansion made it a better game and more expansions will provide an even better and more expanded gameplay.

												When the game was first released it had a lot going against it. Less variety in the races than the previous games, terrible unit balance, Notch. But as time has gone on Triumph has done a surprisingly good job of working on the game. Differences in the races have improved, units are much more balanced, unfortunately Notch is still around. A pretty good fantasy strategy game all told, and if Triumph continues it'll only get better.			"

Its a little game i call Age of Wonders 3 and its worth every penny you could spend. The story is deep and rich and the countless random maps and scenarios supply you with endless entertainment. Great to play with a group of friends! Plus it isnt like 60 dollars or even 50 its 40!!! You cant still be reading this...BUY IT ALREADY!			"

												The game before this one(AOW:SM) is the greatest fantasy turn based strategy game ever.This one does not hold up, it has some of the same bugs and they changed the rules to make it less playable. I was able to beat it like the last one, but I belong to the cult of the random map(check my achievments) and played it 12 players all king at king level with everything on fast and I was able to find a good place to fester(more about that) just like in the last one but there are major differences. Now there are some very good things about this game as well. Also I played a draconian earth specialist drednaut. The lack of carriers.I mean units that can carry other units like the airships in AOW:SM, or the steam tank. It was very handy to use carriers to put a city in a hard to reach place by transporting a settler. Now it has to be a place that you can get to normally, BTW anyone know of a way to have a hero give its unit lava walking?  I was unable to and just gave up,.The magic item creation system using points. This just makes no sense, I mean why limit the total number of magic items you can create? It just takes away from the fun of the game. That was half the fun, once you got a bunch of items and figured out how you wanted them on your heros you will fill in the holes with stuff you would make yourself. It wasnt as powerful as the stuff you would find but that was ok, magic items are magic items. That champion levels are unlimited. I am normally not against things being unlimited, but this really can unbalence the game. Infact its how I won the game, in the old game I would use dragons or dread reapers all magiced and veteraned up as machines of destruction, nothing could stand in their way.  I might lose one in a really tough battle but I always had one to replace it. But there was a limit, once you got 255 experience points on  a unit it was maxed out. Now I have had units at champion level 60+, mostly earth elementals. they start having hundreds of hit points and the only way to get rid of them is banish them and that doesnt always work. Now this is against the ai, but its a perfect way to make a very sharp stick, take  18 earth elementals, march them past a city or two and  take a city a little bit behind the lines. replace any loses and leave them in a triangle formation in the city(3x6) and just wait. It wont take long and the AI will start attacking it with everything its got, keep replacing loses and getting more and more experience points. Once they are above champion level 10 I would be surprised if you had replace one. Also always do autocombat, the ai never seems to use banish during autocombat. And when you get one above level 40-50 you can do something like station it with a bunch of nubes at a tunnel enterance and not worry about holding it.And a unit of 6 high level(over 40) earth elementals can hold a city no matter what, I have seen them be surrounded by 36 units and most of them were juggernauts and not lose a single unit, not even have a unit with any real damage.  I would just use cities like that as farms to raise really high level earth elementals which I then used to win the game with. If I had figured out about earth elementals earlier it wouldnt have taken me like 1300 turns. I have my last save game before I won if anyone wants it. That you can only cast one spell per turn including your heros. I admit that it does slow down the play some and I am not 100% agianst it, but I miss being able to cast a spell and have a hero follow it up with one of their own. The same bugs, save game, takes forever with too many units. game will start to crash alot after turn 1000 on a huge map. I swear this game has some of the same bugs as the last one, its like they reused the same code for alot of things. Sometimes if you run the game for a really long time it loses the ability to write to the disk properly. if when you go to save a game and you dont see an autosave even if its turned on then thats sign thats are messed up. There is a work around, save to the cloud which works fine, exit and restart and load the game from the cloud. Also even on a powerful machine when its on a huge map with lots of players and with lots of armies,  each turn can take almost 10 minutes sometimes . Plus after turn 1000 the game starts crashing, and I usally have to go back to the autosave and I am fine. After awhile its crashes like every turn or so. I have a save game I can send you if you want to see. I like the class system, the new units, extra hero level, how the new heros work, alot of the new game play and the graphics. The graphics are really nice. I wish someone would make a mod for AOW3 that addresed these problems, it probably would be the best fantasy turn-based strategy game around. festering, is the process of finding a good defensible position using it as a base to eventually start regaining terrority. In AOW:SM it was underground or even better an island in the shadow lands. The only way to reach them is be directly above it and do a shadow shift. In this one I was able to fester in a nice cave underground that had two narrow entrances. I build a tower just inside the enterance, and then a city behind that. So an invading army could only bring in 6 units to attack my 18-24 units. They wouln't even try, well after I created a trap city nearby. Thats a city with nothing in it, so the AI would immediatley take it, but its close by enough for me to use forge blast many times a turn till they are weak enough that I can send my heros to mop up. Just keep your base safe while  you farm high level units to eventually take the whole board.My yes to recommend this game is only because its possible to fix these issues and the game looks really good.

												*CAUTION*: I would rate this game 3.5/5 stars.Bottom Line: What this game does, this game does well; but it's what it doesn't do that hurts the most. It's worthwhile for multiplayer, but for singleplayer I'd look elsewhere. My personal recommendation would be Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes.This game offers some of the most advanced features found in any 4X game, but at the expense of bread-and-butter features we've all come to love and expect. For example: Every unit has numerous abilities, but you're only allowed to cast up to a certain amount of magic per turn (ie. campaign map turn); this means that you could have hundreds of battles per turn, but end up using magic in only a handful. Personally, I think this is extremely unreasonable and silly. I am not opposed to having a global mana pool (which this game does have), but I think it is much more realistic and enjoyable to have casting units use spells every battle round than just be subject to a global cap. Even a per-battle cap or per-unit-per-battle or per-unit-per-turn cap would have been more reasonable. I understand that this must have been implemented as a way to prevent exploiting battle through repetitive casting, but it would have been better to counterbalance the repeated-casting system rather preventing it from happening in the first place.I also very much miss the ""crowd attack"" feature, in which allies adjacent to the enemy join in on melee attacks, that games such as Fallen Enchantress have. Sure, we might have multi-army battles, but what's the point when the quality of an individual battle when down the toilet?And the campaign maps are so boring! Yeah, the terrain is very well varied, and naval battles aren't terrible (though they aren't great either), but the almost complete and total lack of events, and the very elementary spawning of mobs and acquisition of heroes leaves much to be desired. Contrast, again, to Fallen Enchantress, in which events are varied and frequent, both good and bad, both global and local, and where mobs spawn and respawn as opposed to be eliminated once and for all once they are defeated. Yeah, Fallen Enchantress isn't perfect (the #1 problem: it lacks multiplayer!!! But I still think it is the greatest single-player 4X game of all time, at the time of writing), nor is any 4X game (currently!), but the best way to describe AOW3 in one word is disproportionate. Enjoyable in aspects, and frustratingly deprived in others.			"

												First I'd like to say I don't totally hate this game. There are aspects that are done well and are enjoyable. The graphics are very nice. The battles are well done. Having the ability to decide whether battles are AI controlled or manual is nice. The options for kinds of leaders are well done.That having been said there are several aspects of the game that are deal breakers for me. First, having to connect to the AOW servers even to play a LAN game is annoying. Not having an IP connection option unless through a VPN is more than annoying. The lack of this feature that we use in many other games makes the game feel unfinished at best.It's obvious that the AOW servers do not really have the bandwidth to accomodate the numbers of players that they have. Of the three players I normally play with I have the middle connection to the internet. I have been completely unable to get a speed adequate to host a game. Weirdly, the player in our group with the fastest connection also can not get a connection fast enough to host. However, our player with the slowest connection has been able to, though it fades in and out. Since we play other games that have similar connection requirements and we are all able to host, it is clearly a problem with the bandwidth at AOW. Not being able to host makes the game unplayable.We started playing as allies vrs AI players. The game taking us into the battles of the other players from whatever we're doing and focing us to watch the battle rather than allowing us to continue our turns in a simultaneous turn based interface is a very poor programming choice. That alone makes the game frustrating enough and actually makes it unplayable for the duration of the battle.At this point, several of us are playing through our first game. I can't wait to finish the game and go back to playing another simultaneous turn based game. I'd really like to like this game, but without a direct IP connect, inadequate bandwidth at the AOW server, and forced watching of battles during turns of allies, I won't be back to play again and can't recommend this game to others.

												Curator Review:AoW3 is a 4X, Turn-Based Strategy Fantasy game that feels like a mix of Civilization V and Heroes of Might and Magic. Take control of one of the great races and conquer your enemies or make allies to create global peace. Overall, it is a pretty fun game. Probably won't be a staple of the channel but it was fun while it lasted.

Also even on a powerful machine when its on a huge map with lots of players and with lots of armies,  each turn can take almost 10 minutes sometimes . Plus after turn 1000 the game starts crashing, and I usally have to go back to the autosave and I am fine. After awhile its crashes like every turn or so. I have a save game I can send you if you want to see. I like the class system, the new units, extra hero level, how the new heros work, alot of the new game play and the graphics. The graphics are really nice. I wish someone would make a mod for AOW3 that addresed these problems, it probably would be the best fantasy turn-based strategy game around. festering, is the process of finding a good defensible position using it as a base to eventually start regaining terrority. In AOW:SM it was underground or even better an island in the shadow lands. The only way to reach them is be directly above it and do a shadow shift. In this one I was able to fester in a nice cave underground that had two narrow entrances. I build a tower just inside the enterance, and then a city behind that. So an invading army could only bring in 6 units to attack my 18-24 units. They wouln't even try, well after I created a trap city nearby. Thats a city with nothing in it, so the AI would immediatley take it, but its close by enough for me to use forge blast many times a turn till they are weak enough that I can send my heros to mop up. Just keep your base safe while  you farm high level units to eventually take the whole board.My yes to recommend this game is only because its possible to fix these issues and the game looks really good.

												 If you like the RTS genre and can get into this type of fantasy let me help you pick a game this holiday. Its a little game i call Age of Wonders 3 and its worth every penny you could spend. The story is deep and rich and the countless random maps and scenarios supply you with endless entertainment. Great to play with a group of friends! Plus it isnt like 60 dollars or even 50 its 40!!! You cant still be reading this...BUY IT ALREADY!			"

												Just bought this game earlier this week and have been playing it non-stop with a friend of mine. It shares many economic and empire-building mechanics with Civilization 5, but gameplay is much more focused around combat and conquest, and games tend to be shorter (at least thus far). Combat, unlike in Civ, is done on a small-scale tactical level, where the camera essentially zooms in to the individual hex where the units are battling, and both players use their armies and units on a small scale. To me, this is the most significant thing that makes this game enjoyable (along with the leader customization, which had me in tears laughing on day 1). While $30 is a high price, this game certainly feels worth it this far in.TL;DR: Like Civ, except fun.			"

												after 10 hours of game play, I can say that this is a great game. I am really enjoying it. I wish they would have included an actual tutorial, but after playing the suggested rookie campaign, and tinkering around alot in all the buttons, windows and their version of a ""civilopedia"", I finally think I got it figured out. I love the story line of the campaign mode, and the strategic battles are a lot of fun. Save often...  buy this when you can!			"

												Every time I play this I have fun.Also I just made a 5 level map with protected areas and one way portals.  Here are my maps.AI Improvements:And now the AI seems to be smart enough to handle that map without drooling like an embecile!  I think this is great - because now I can continue work on that map and make it what I had envisioned in the first place, or close to it at least.The big drawback to most randomly generated maps is that once an area is ""cleaned up"" it remains mostly dormant.  So that is somewhat mitigated with the map I'm working on.Because the AI has improved, I can seriously consider getting the other DLC I was holding back on.Atmosphere:Atmospherically, this game is possibly THE BEST LOOKING FANTASY 4X OF ALL TIME.  Go ahead, just try going into the editor to create your own map.  It's like spending time painting a picture - very relaxing way to spend time and it's productive and fun to make an atmosphere people might enjoy.Other than the board, the UI is very nice.  I guess I don't really notice when a UI is nice - I only notice when it's deplorable - and this one is artful and it's clear a lot of love went into it.  Hero Generation:The character generator has personality.  Really - this is the first game with a character generator (I guess I mean avatar) where I spent time with the appearance giving each one personality.  Because the range of appearances and role play are vastly beyond anything I've seen before - making a creepy witch was my favorite.Tactics:This is a great tactical mind workout playing the tactical map for each battle.  Because the maps are relatively large, interesting strategies can take place.  I don't anticipate Endless Legend will ever come close to the tactical experience AoW provides.City Building:There are maybe 6 or so different building ""paths"" to choose for a city.  So to get access to specific units you might have to build several buildings on a specific path.  These paths aren't very obvious and there's a learning / memorization (or documentation lookup) curve involved with cities.  I like it, but it might not suit everyone.Units:Units are not customizable, although heros are.  This is where Endless Legend seems to provide a vaster gameplay experience in comparison.  All units do level though, which is at least somewhat engaging to track which units are closest to leveling to prioritize who gets the kills and reap XP.Community:The modding community is very active and supportive.  I got a lot of encouragement and comments and that makes a huge game engagement difference, if you enjoy trying other people's mods or making them yourself.Missing Things Nobody Misses:There's something you can log into.  I have no idea.  I just play as guest all the time.  So it's a non-intrusive experience unlike other games.  Guess what?  That lack of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t commands a higher price tag and is well worth it.

												I have no idea where the praise for this game comes from, probably because I'm not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It is without a doubt the worst game purchase I have made in the last few years. Unbalanced and idiotic mechanics only serve to highlight the astounding incompetence of the development team when it comes to everything about this pile of trash aside from the visuals. I feel ripped off after spending a few hours with the game now and only out of competitive compulsion will I put any more time into it… That and it's not like I can get a ****ing refund so I might as well punish myself for buying it until I feel like I’ve gotten my money’s worth in suffering. Pros: Pretty for what it is.Cons: It exists. Aside from that...Build walls around your fortress expecting those to aid in defense? Jokes on you dummy, every pissant unit in the game has ladders that they will scale your stupid walls with in a single move before killing all your units with rocks. Spend a lot of time juicing up your armies so you're churning out tons of high end units? Jokes on you ***hole! In the first round the enemy will MC all your awesome units and use them to destroy you! (Cue evil laughter) Build a few cities to generate better income? Better not upgrade those new shanty towns because every turn you're not producing droves of crap units, the computer is and it will use them to penetrate your happiness and ruin your day much like a drunken priest who stumbles upon an aloof alterboy eating icecream and watching hanna barbara cartoons. It will make you feel♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and molested, that is what I'm saying.I work hard for my money and I like gaming, I love strategy games, and from the screen shots to the apparently paid for positive commentary on here I thought ""hey this looks like a great game!"" It's not, it's not worth your money and it's not worth your time. Want an RTS? Grab supcom: fa for 8$s or whatever it's going for right now, pick an eight person map, fill the other slots with hard AI's and enjoy the next 3 hours of screaming and ranting your way to a satisfying nuclear victory while under constant assault and relish the dependable joy of seeing your naval factory get blown up by bomb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the minute it gets to tech 3. That is a strategy game. This is a useless wannabe civ clone that plays like it was made by a bunch of LOTR fanbois who might have watched someone else play a game of total war and thought ""hey I can make that"". You want to know how stupid this game is? Fallen Enchantress is about 300xs better, at least in that I can get a pet bear to suffer the incompetent fight mechanics with me until I tame a dragon and laugh my way to victory (TROGDOR!!!!!). There is no absurdity to lighten up just how much this games sucks. It's not that I ""don't recommend"" this game, it's that I vehemently discourage ANYONE from purchasing this PoS and hope the jack*** developers go broke, get run out of the gaming community and are forced to take lame jobs working in fast food while they watch the bank repossess all their stuff because they suck at life. That is how♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off I am at how crappy this game is, because that's how much I hate feeling like I got robbed when I buy something. "

												A turn based strategy game in a similar vein to Fallen Enchantress. Game takes place on two levels, the overall strategic map, and a tactical battle map to resolve conflicts. Units come in quite a range of flavours from simple swordsmen up to and including what are basically tanks but the end game consists mainly of building large armies of whatever your single best unit is and throwing them at the enemy. You have a range of different different races with different base abilities but this only really impacts the early game as the special units (based on what class your leader is and researched into the middle of the game) tend to be massively better and are for the most part the same regardless of the race that built them.The AI isn't too much of a challenge on the strategic map, it does however do a decent job in the tactical battles.So all in all: not brilliant but certainly not bad. I got my money's worth out of it but I don't think I'll be replaying it anytime soon. "

												I played this game right after playing Galatic Civilation III. It is very similar yet vastly different.Its much simpler, in the fact you don't have to micro manage little things (Unless you really want to) and the fact that the controls are streamlined.I love the different heros and classes and the fact that you can make your own is so much fun. The fact I can make these vast armies lead by such interesting and diverse heros riding on horses drakes and boars. One of my favorite things to do after getting a bunch of heros is going to assault fortresses, because you need to send different units to different walls and makes flanking a vital (and FUN) tactic!However, I will admit its so simple it feels sort of cheap at times. I haven't played long so this may be my own ignorance to certain features, but at times I feel I have a lack of control over development of my cities. For example, I'm not entirely sure how to increase my currency gains, or increase production and research rates.Lastly, THIS GAME IS GORGEOUS! It is so good looking for a turned based empire builder that its actually distracting! I love it! Each city looks fantastic, mines have productive animations, the abandoned fortresses, crypts and dungeons look appropriately mystic and intimadating; its like playing on a masterpiece!			"

												Not too difficult and an overall nice turnbased 4x4 game.Why buy it?I have played each AoW and I like this one the best, though I liked the first one as well. I already knew the game so it wasn´t a difficult decision to buy this one, for people that have not played this game yet and like strategy/tactics with civ building.. it is worth it.Remarks:My old Windforce GTX 770 did get pushed a bit with this game, on the highest settings anyway. Though it did not matter and the game was fully playable. Recommend:Yes.			"

												I believe this is one of the top tier turn-based games I have played yet. It has a Civ feel to it, yet it varies in many ways. The entire fantasy setting hits home to me and I love it. To include the ability to be good vs. evil, having heroes to fight with, to be able to choose to perform the battle yourself, and to have an Underworld along with the Overworld is just quite amazing. Would recommend this game any day			"

												One of the best turn-based strategy games with a wonderful fantasy setting. If you liked Heroes of Might and Magic or CIV then I have to recommend this game. The most important feature of AoW3 might be the creation process of your leader. Like in roleplay games you can choose out of 9 different races, 7 different classes, a view traits and many styles. The combination of race and class can lead to a very stereotypical warrior-like orc-empire or to a holy goblin-nation of saints. Its up to you. The focus is a bit more in fighting compared to CIV, nevertheless there are four different ways to win. Also there is great campagne and online-community too. Buy this game.			"

												I have put 62 hours of gameplay in, so far, and have greatly enjoyed this game. The setting of high fantasy is well portrayed, the gameplay (as of right now) is well balanced and enjoyable. I can play and enjoy all of the classes and options  (although I've already develeped preferences). The gameplay, I find, to be much more engaging than a game like Civilization V. You have many more options, and combat is far quicker and graphically more interesting to view. The gameplay for large maps, and multiplayer games, can be fairly slow. It will take a long time to complete large mulitplayer games, and hours at least to complete the small ones. However, the game is well set up so that in every phase of the game there is plenty for you to do and to plan out. The stories are also quite enjoyable. The default campaigns are decently long with an interesting story and plenty of background on the world that it is taking place in. One drawback however is the main leader of your faction shifts in almost every level, which I find a bit annoying, but at the same time you get to play with much more diversity than you do in say Warcraft 3. My only other dislike about the campaigns is that the DLC campaigns are far shorter than I would prefer, and none of the campaigns are as long and complex as what you will find in Warcraft 3. That aside the gameplay is fantastic, the options are great, and I would fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn based strategy and/or high-fantasy game settings.			"

Hope to see more races and City / Empire Building / Diplomacy enhancements over time ... "

Honest rating. 8.5/10 * rating doesn't include multiplayer or the two expansions*			"

												Age of Wonders III is a great game, the gameplay is exciting and the units are cool and interesting. The mechanics makes my body shake in happines, especially when I see that I can make an army of skeleton units. Cool right?, Well this is not the enitre deal with this game. This game suffers from performance issues, mostly noticeable in multiplayer games. What I'm talking about is that the game like lags but doesn't. The game flows on in it's 60 fps or whatever it's locked in, but as fast as I issue an command to my unit, like equip this weapon the game will atleast take 6 - 10 seconds before it's actually equipped. I have only noticed this while playing online with a friend of mine. How's the campaign than, atleast that's good right?Well.. no, it's not that interesting. I prefer the scenario mode or just random map mode.But in the end I still recommed this game for hardcore strategy players			"

												Of all the genres that can devour hours like seconds, there are two - 4X Strategy and Roleplay.  Age of Wonders takes both of them and offers up the addictive hybrid genre that is 4X Roleplaying Stategy and presents it in a classical fantasy setting.  If you enjoy both Sid Meier's Civilization and Fire Emblem, Age of Wonders is an awesome franchise to get stuck into.Word of warning though - The recommended AoW3 campaign for ""New Players"" isn't overly beginner-friendly.  Watching Youtube tutorials, experimenting with random games and using The Tome of Wonders should better help new players gain a feel for the game.			"

												I'm a fan of Heroes of the Might and Magic. I did like the Civilization series, I was very dissapointed with the insanely huge waiting times in Civilization V  - I am no longer playing because of the waiting times. I like a lot the Dungeon and Dragons types of games. I read some reviews about the Age of Wonders before deciding to buy it.I have not played too much, but I already have an opinion about the game.Is it a game where I would like to own the best items on the map, to own the whole map? Not really, the game becomes boring, I do not find myself attracted by it as I was attracted by HOMM (I played 5 of them, I didn't like the fourth). Maybe increasing the AI difficulty will get some more competivity - I am not playing this game in multiplayer, it would take ages for a medium to large map.I did not encounter  bugs - for me the game works fine. City building? Nah, this game does not compare with Civilization, they are not in the same zone, Civilization is far more ""advanced"" and way more polished. Combat? Bring the bigger army and generally you will win - I did not see too many exceptions. Empire building? More cities, get more ressources - I think we could check this as an ""yes"", empire building is there. RPG? So-so. I do recommend the game though. Nothing is perfect, if you didn't play Heroes of the Might and Magic, this game might partially make you enjoy some time playing it. But don't get your hopes too high, it is not by far of the same feeling as Baldur's Gate, Civilization, Icewind Dale or Dragon Age: Origins. Theoretically it competes with Heroes of the Might and Magic, but I would recommend without any remorse HOMM III or V over Age of Wonders III.I will not rant too much. The conclusion is: there are much much better games out there. A lot of work has been put into this game as well, if you don't want to play the ""best"" rpg/empire building game, Age of Wonders will do just fine.A later note: after a while in the game, mainly 2 spells are used in the important battles. Only 2. And the one who defends has the first move in the battle, so guess who is using first one of the ""big"" spells. The third spell, the dispell, has a percentage of being successful, so... Yeah, 2 spells.			"

												I love this. I get tired of playing civilization by the end game and the combat in this one just has me thrilled. I'm still only partially through the campaign and have played a couple of short random scenarios but the sheer amount of races, classes and units makes it a blast.It's all the best part of city building with all my favorite parts of HOMM. Great game and a huge time waster. Just make sure you're okay with it being almost entirely about combat and magic. "

												AoW 3 is my favorite game turnbased game ever. I played and enyoyed AoW1 and AoW2 alot but this game takes the series to a new level. The class/race combo makes each game diffrent. The AI is very good. The game isn´t easy but the combat system is clear and far superior to any other similar game I played. The battle fields are very beutiful. The comming Necromancer expansion will sort out the only things I think isn´t fleshed out yet, which is the reputation and good/evil affinnity system.			"

												There are some huge negatives for me:-Lower tier units rapidly become useless compared to higher tiered units. Although higher tiered units require some investment to acquire, they are not much more expensive than the lower tiered units. This makes it such that the best strategies are just spamming leviathans, flame tanks, or archon titans. I don't like that. I prefer the skirmishes the early game has to offer, with lots of archers, swordsmen, and caster armies. These feel tactical and well-suited, but once players can begin to amass the higher tiered units it just becomes a race to see who can build these the most. War is then less about exploration and tactics, and more just who managed to assert a few good cities and start pumping out the stronger units. It's a classic problem for most strategy games, but here it ruins the fun for me. This problem has been solved reasonably well in the past - it's not like riflemen in Warcraft 3 suddenly went out of style even towards the end of a game, yet archers rapidly become useless in this. It's annoying.Otherwise, it's a fun turn-based game in dire need of some hard balancing (honestly, leviathans are insane since you can sumnmon them anywhere with mana and have a fear effect PLUS they can mind control units, it's not even fair if a player gets six of these up and running, which isn't hard to do if you get enough shrines).

												People have been, understandably, comparing this game to Civ V and the more recent Endless Legend.Let me get one thing straight. All three games are the best in their genre. Period. If you wasnt historical/fantasy 4x empire building then look no further than AoW3, Civ V and Endless Legend.Now, let's get another thing straight. Civ V may have the large scope and fine-tuned balance, Endless Legend may have the complex city-building and diplomacy, but Age of Wonders III has so, so much more.For starters, city-building is not the focus, and you won't miss it. AoW3 gives you enough to satisfy, but then focuses your attention on much more epic things, like tactical combat on a zoomed-in battlefield, fully customizeable, RPG characters with gear, inventory, mounts and skill-trees (no joke!) and diplomacy options that cut to the chase and get the job done.The ONLY negative thing I can say about this game so far is that it feels mildly unbalanced at times. But not to worry! The game is regularly updated and it gets better every time.If you want a 4x empire builder/tactical combat/role playing game in a fantasy setting, well, this really is the only option, and boy, is it a good one!BONUS: Michiel van den Bos' original score for this game is ABSOLUTELY.FREAKIN.STUNNING. Seriously, you're going to find yourself humming his epic tunes to yourself when you're not paying attention.			"

												I played the original, then the second, and now this. The game has made both incremental and drastic improvements over the years. If you're a fan of turn-based heroes of might and magic or civilization style games, this might be sort of up your alley. The ""best"" part is the fact that there's a fairly complex turn-based piece battle system waiting there for you as well. The story line is the best kind of fantasy camp.33% empire management, 66% tactical battles, 1% giggling as your giant/dragon/elemental bashes archers in their god damn mouths.			"

												Kind of disappointed after really getting into Shadow Magic a few years ago. This one just isn't as good - the campaigns are nowhere near the great level of story we got in AOW:SM, and while the Wizard classes have been separated out a bit (so you're playing more a style rather than an element), there's a morality system (straight Good / Evil) which makes roleplaying properly pretty difficult. There are the usual mobs guarding each useful resource, but a good Elf killing these independent elves gives you evil points - the same goes for if you're playing Orcs killing independent goblins or trolls guarding a mine - you would get ""Good"" points for doing this..... Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but the main sticking points for me are the campaign story and secondly the zoom-in battles. I realise a lot of people complained that ranged units were a bit OP before, but now you just can't get in a shot in city sieges before climbers and wall-passers are on you! Another smaller not-really-a-problem was that there was a lack of heroes turning up. The levelling system for them seems improved and my few ended up with far too much gear - have more turn up please!6/10 - If you like this kind of 4X exploration / city-building / TBC then I'd buy Shadow Magic instead. Much better.			"

												A great iteration on a classic series - my favorite of the three by far. The game was pretty solid on release, wandered over into ""excellent"" territory after Golden Realms and the accompanying balance/content patches, and is looking to cross over into ""unbelievable"" with the Necromancer/Frostling expansion coming in early 2015 (new content, well-thought out balance and strategic adjustments, and a unique server-side Play-By-Email variant!)Icing on the cake - the dev team at Triumph is incredible; they've always been very sharp, responsive, and friendly.The one area I'd give this game a lower grade for would be its campaign. While they've tried to fill the campaign with a rich story and interesting events, sometimes the underlying 4X game doesn't mesh so well with the campaign goals, and those maps turn into tight rushes or long slogs. The game truly shines in its individual scenarios and especially in its well-done random map generator, both in SP and MP. "

												This game is a strategist's gold mine. The units are unique and very interesting for each race and each class have perks that anyone can love.  The mechanics make the battles more realistic, with the pikemen getting in the first hit even when attacked due to their long polearms for example. Best of all, with the recent update, the AI is definately a real challenge, even on the lowest difficulty. Even the bandits are a lot smarter too, using their Sprint ability to outflank your units which sort of makes them more annoying though. If you want a turn-based strategy game that's truly amazing and that forces your to plan every move carefully, then AOW III is your gem.Civilization V + Chess+ Total War? = Age of Wonders III			"

I have a lot of experiance with these type of games and weither i try rapid expansion and focus on research to get the high teir guy or focus on making few powerfull cities , the PC always starts with many more fully devoloped cities nd can field massive armies of units far beyond your tech levels , if you can hand in there long enough to start pumping them out yourself you can slowly turn the game around .Its a really great game single playerwise just grossly imbalanced and the pc almost seems undefeatable on normal at times.

												Age of Wonders III is a disappointing sequel to a disappointing sequel. The original game wasn't perfect mechanically, but had a great depth of lore and unique content, featuring dual campaigns which branched and featured various races. This game has but a single primary campagin, and as far as i played into it, was extremely linear.Still i have hope that additional content and the potential for a fun multiplayer game will make Age of Wonders 3 worth picking up, just wait for a sale.

												This is a great 4x fantasy game.  The creators are constantly planning new content and making them ""expansions"", releasing paid content in a very appropriate manner which is more than I can say for the majority of the games on steam that have DLC.  So far, only 1 expansion and they are planning the second one and previewing it through dev blogs and the improvements they are planning look great.  Even if you are not a big fan of DLC, it's not like you need to buy in order to have a complete game.  When the first expansion was released, it came with a free patch for everyone who owns the game that fixed a few bugs and generally improved gameplay.  There is already a lot to do in the vanilla game and expansions add a significant amount more.			"

												Following my ""ex-favorite"" game of all times, Age of Wonders III does not disappoint. It expands in every aspect possible. And even with lesser races availible at the beginning, it expended quickly with affordable dlc. Free Updates every few months are making the game even bigger. The ratio of costs for contant is in my oppinion unique in the gaming industry and it proves that this sale model still works in our time of microtransactions.

												I just started. I have only completed one map, but I played for eleven hours straight because this game warrants it. Everything levels up, and as they do all sorts of upgrades occur. Many of them are automatic, but you get to customize your heros in useful ways. They give you 5 points to spend as you please. These can new passive or active bonuses including, but not exclusive to: attack up, defense up, life up, rapid regeneration, resistance up, new abilities like heal, rust, first strike, increased vision. The settlements have a simple spread, but it is deep enough for you to specialize with the bonus reasources inside of your domain. There are not many units that cannot be dealt with by tier 1 (the lowest) units if you get their experience all the way up. Archers are actually protected by the infantry you place in front of them because attacks of opportunity are present. The only real complaint I have is with the notifications system. It tells you most things twice, and in such a way that you may not know how to respond. For instance, if an enemy enters your territory you get a notification that will highlight the square the enemy entered. Unfortunately, this is not normally going to be the last square the enemy occupied, so you will need to search in up to a 12 square radius for said enemy. This is a fast paced game. If you don't overrun your enemy quickly, expect a long uphill battle.			"

												Wondrous game. For people who doesn't know what AoW series is: imagine Heroes of Might and Magic and Civilization had a... bah! that's too predictable; Imagine they were ripped apart by unknown mad scientist and made into one new creature. Imagine that creature is, by some miracle, gracious and beautiful despite all gory details of it's birth. Here, you have Age of Wonders series.Customizable heroes! Major factions! Minor factions! Magic (lots of it)! Epic battles (say, army of penguins led by huge ogre versus dragon and chipmunk assasin squad)! Ancient ruins! Treasures! Artifacts (most of which are wearable/wieldable)! Econimic stagnation! Religious concerns! Racism! Notch (of Minecraft fame) as playable hero! You name it, this game has it.To sum that^ bananas up: give Age of Wonders III a shot. Just do it. Nike does it. Why don't you..			"

												This game has a great many aspects I personally enjoy, the most prominant being the ability to create the leader of your faction/ primary hero unit. With the ability to customize class, race, and skill specialization (as well as appearance, of course), AoW pulls off their mix of fantasy RPG and strategy game deftly. The 3 choices above have a real impact, given that they determine what elite units you can produce and what spells you can cast.The only weakness of the game is, sadly, its battle system. For fans of the Total War series, who will find most of this game rather easy to adapt to, the lack of ability to plan and strategize battles as well as you do diplomacy or city development can be very frustrating. One example of this is pre-battle deployment, which arranges all units in a long line, seemingly at random. One often feels slightly helpless in these battles, as the whim of the computer will sometimes place powerful ranged units with no armor in the center, in striking distance of the enemy infantry, while your infantry are placed on the end of the line, and are therefore useless for the first few turns. In essence, deployment becomes the deciding factor in many battles, and you don't control it.This is a rather gaping hole of bad design in an otherwise well put together game. Buy it if it's on sale, as the rest of the game is quite fun, but honestly if you've got enough money to pay full price just buy Endless Legend (which is better, apparently; I've never played it)TL,DR : Fun blend of strategy and fantasy RPG with a few oversights, esspecially in the battle system. Buy it if it's on sale.			"

												Awesome follow up to Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic that isn't content to just rehash the same old mechanics. It manages to recreate the atmosphere of the older Age of Wonders games while changing up the game is some pretty dramatic and intelligent ways. Age of Wonders III separates race and culture for units; a goblin, for example, can now be any type of class from Theocrat to Rouge. This not only adds a tremendous variety and replayability to the game, but is also a statement that race shouldn't define one's culture. Things to complain about? I get nostalgic for the awesome 2D art of the older games. All the graphics are now rendered in 3D which have less charm and sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish low and mid tier units from one another. On the battlefield, mid and low tier units are no longer individuals, but small stacks that function like individuals. As such, they are smaller and sometimes indistinguishable from one another. It's something you get used to, and since the units are as full of personality as the older games, it's ultimately a minor complaint. There are also less races to choose from than the older games, but since you now must choose both race and class, variety doesn't suffer as much as you would think. Still, the more races and classes as Triumph Studios makes available, the better. I'm personally hoping for Dark Elves and Lizardmen. This is one of the best fantasy 4X games out there; a nice balance of new and old, great music and atmosphere, and a bright future ahead of it in the way of expansions and patches.			"

												AOW3 is a solid title. It can be compared roughly to Fallen Enchantress or Heroes of Might & Magic/ Kings Bounty, with a few major, major differences. There's significantly less emphasis placed on the range of options in strategic meta-game (the focus is on war, full stop) , and hero development is more of a shallow affair.However, it more than makes up for these deficiencies/differences with its combat system.Games are fast, and combat has a great deal of depth (flanking, better use of 3-D space) that you won't see in other fantasy 4x titles. The pacing is such that AOW doesn't want you waiting 20 turns between battles, but keeps them coming, turn after turn. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys online or random map play and likes the genre, although I am really enjoying the single player campaign after I've discovered the secret to making it easier (and having more fun) is to play a breakneck pace constantly on the rush. The intial learning curve is a little steep, but once you get the hang of it, you'll enjoy playing the battles (for the most part, as large engagements are neat to see, but kind of a mess to coordinate).

												TLDR Version:      Come for the solid magically enhanced and customizable strategery, stay for the lawlz. Worth.Long Version:     Want a game that's similar to the Civilization games but with a magic system and customizable troops that you can make awesome squads out of like a goblin with a stick riding a bug, a majestic pegasus, a dragon that spits fire, a sprite(the magical creature, not the soda but that would be awesome and they should add that in future DLC!) and a huge gassy obese fishman thing? It has that!     Want a game where you can make a goofy (or not goofy, if you're so inclined) looking being out of a bunch of fantastical races and classes that can actually change the way you play the game so you can dominate the map as a grotesque goblin magitechnowizard that summons spy drones so he doesn't ever have to leave the safety of the initial spawn point in order to troll his neighbors?It has that TOO!      Want a game where you can make a magical boar fight a regular ol' boring natural boar to the death all while fighting an undead menace and at the same time shoot them with a catapult while sieging a castle and setting the battlefield on fire with your mind so you can find out what treasure they have been hiding from you, all while cackling menacingly as you ask someone (politely, mind you) in the room to bring you a pee bottle/poo bucket so you don't actually have to leave the game for one minute?All this can happen to you, AND MORE, if you buy this game.

												While the game retains the same charm and interest of its predecessors in the series, the developers for the game have not resolved some of the gameplay faults of the older game, allowing the player to ""trial and error"" their way through learning the functionality of the game rather than providing a solid tutorial or ""advisor"" option, common in more modern games, in order to reduce the tedium of learning how to interact with the complex systems within the game.While I am recommending this game, if the next generation of AoW doesn't include more modern QoL features, I will not be recommending any future installments, and won't purchase any past the fourth (provided in the 4th they don't improve the QoL).

												so im not going to say its the best game ever it has some good points and some negitive ones. The positive points make the game worth playing such as every race is uniquie and has uniquie units to them which means multible playthroughs to see the diffrent unit types. Also diffrent classes have specific spells that only they can use and specific units that only that class can produce which again means multible playthroughs. I also think its fun to gather your armys and exspore the world although it becomes difficult to maintain armies as they get exspencive and they will end up costing more gold then what you can produce which makes sence. Although one of the negitives is this doesn'tseem to affect the AI players as the have massive armies floating around. And there is one of the down sides the Ai are near unstobalbe as they can through massive armies at you and their spells are nearly always effective in combat. Also the only way to win the game i through dominathion peace treatys mean nothing in this eventually out of no where the AI will declare war on you and you cant do much to hold your lines as their massive armies quickly overrun you espically when you have a war on 4 fronts your not going to last long. The AI will never allie with you so that ones out or so i found anyway. All in all i would say for the sheir replay value its worth having a run on just to see all the races and classes in action.

												Enjoyable.  I've completed one campaign and played a few solo-maps.  I like the class system, but I do feel as though they drained the importantce of the different magic realms to make the classes important.  I'll return to it on and off over the years, just like I did with AoW: SM.			"

												While the game retains the same charm and interest of its predecessors in the series, the developers for the game have not resolved some of the gameplay faults of the older game, allowing the player to ""trial and error"" their way through learning the functionality of the game rather than providing a solid tutorial or ""advisor"" option, common in more modern games, in order to reduce the tedium of learning how to interact with the complex systems within the game.While I am recommending this game, if the next generation of AoW doesn't include more modern QoL features, I will not be recommending any future installments, and won't purchase any past the fourth (provided in the 4th they don't improve the QoL).

												so im not going to say its the best game ever it has some good points and some negitive ones. The positive points make the game worth playing such as every race is uniquie and has uniquie units to them which means multible playthroughs to see the diffrent unit types. Also diffrent classes have specific spells that only they can use and specific units that only that class can produce which again means multible playthroughs. I also think its fun to gather your armys and exspore the world although it becomes difficult to maintain armies as they get exspencive and they will end up costing more gold then what you can produce which makes sence. Although one of the negitives is this doesn'tseem to affect the AI players as the have massive armies floating around. And there is one of the down sides the Ai are near unstobalbe as they can through massive armies at you and their spells are nearly always effective in combat. Also the only way to win the game i through dominathion peace treatys mean nothing in this eventually out of no where the AI will declare war on you and you cant do much to hold your lines as their massive armies quickly overrun you espically when you have a war on 4 fronts your not going to last long. The AI will never allie with you so that ones out or so i found anyway. All in all i would say for the sheir replay value its worth having a run on just to see all the races and classes in action.

												When I first tried Ago of Wonders 3, I was struck by how similar the interface felt to Civ 5, so I found myself comparing it to Civ 5, but really, Heroes of Might and Magic or Disciples are a much better point of comparison.  If I compare it to Civ 5, I keep gettign disapointed about how simple the city building is, but it is not really more simplified than HoMM or Disciples.  The magic system is on par with DIsciples (which is to say not quite as good as HoMM, but still very respectable), and the tactical combat is very good (better than HoMM or Disciples in my opinion).  The storyline for the campaigns is also well done, but the actual campaigns felt on the short side - The campaign maps were large to huge and offset the lack of scenarios as far as gameplay time. The number of scenarios in each campaign were around 5-6 for each of the two campaigns (with a branch in each to add aother couple scenarios for each).  I prefer more scenarios with smaller maps, but others might prefer the AoW approach.Overall, I find AoW to be a good enjoyable game, but I can't quite put it up there with the same ranks as HoMM 3, or Disciples 2, or the classic Master of Magic.  Quality wise, I would put it int he ranks of HoMM 5, which I still consider to be a very good game.			"

												This game is as complex and deep as it is fun, and let me be clear here, It's REALLY REALLY FUN. If you've played civilization and enjoyed watching a unit raise in rank as you grew your empire. It's a strategy that rewards saving every individual unit with advancement and power, and on top of that there are heroes you can equip and evolve into army clearing baddasses. All the while on the home front your cites are developing spells and pumping out warriors and building roads, The trouble is that you have to learn to do all of this in one turn, which takes some time, but when you do you'll be a Sauron skewering monster in no time, or you could just as easily be the monster yourself.

												Age of Wonders III is a 4x stratergy game that is a product of passion. One can really tell that the developer has put a lot of effort into putting attention to the details of the game ; The graphics, the effects, some of the perks and much more.Overall, a very large bag of good ideas, one could say! But there is, however, a rather large glaring issue with Ager of Wonders III.It's that, for being a 4x game, it's incredibly shallow. And i don't mean to say that to insult the game in any way - But the game is really, really combat-centric and the structures of what is effective (rushing higher Tier units and favoring to find certain Dwellings that provide this possibility (Dragons, for instance)) - Makes this game rather lackluster.The diplomacy system is not that impressive at all, it's very basic - it merely moves in steps of shades, with no real sense of consequence to them other then obvious ones - dwellings attacking you if you tresspass etc.The tech tree is pretty standard, nothing too exciting, nor is it too impressive - A lot of other games do a lot more complexity on this front and offers a lot more powerful ideas on the whole. While not bad, AoW III's tech trees leave much to be desired - as it really only feels like you prioritize some certain spells and then go for higher tier units in your tech. Which is very, very straightforward and shallow, as far as a 4x game goes.There is a very underwhelming item crafting system in the game - While the idea is good at heart, and amazing if expanded upon - it's incredibly limited. It becomes a rather standard routine of churning out certain items to provide certain slot bonuses (as only some slots give certain bonuses, as far as crafting goes), which makes it feel dull and repetetive.What about the gameplay then? Well, the majority of the game, is combat. It's like Heroes 3 of Might and Magic, except with a lot more combat rules and more intrecacies to combat. And the combat is fine, with some rules such as attacks of oppurtounity, flanking and what not.But even this, gets to be rather routine and flawed - leaving not much strategum to be thought out. As really, it will take a very overwhelming force to force you to actually try and fight tactically to the point of thinking about positioning and sustaining your units. Which, frankly, dulls off after a while - because you do combat almost all the time.Hero customization regarding skills is rather generic and the skill up system is very basic. It is not incredible, but it's not bad either. It follows a point system, where of you put points into stats that will enhance your hero - and sometimes, traits. Which leaves it to be very generic and lackluster - In the long run.All in all, if i had to sum up Age of Wonders III, i would say that i can recommend it at a discount - Or if you feel you can afford it, just to have an experience. The game is definitly not bad per say, and is quite a blast in the beginning!But overall, the game really, really lacks longevity and the flawed ideas of it's design become very apparent after a while, making the game feel very shallow and lackluster, compared to other 4x games.

There is a loyal and dedicated following of players, and they discuss tactics and balancing issues on forums everywhere. There is also a very helpful wiki online. The pace is slow and not for casual gamers.Great game. I recommend it.Update: this remains one of the few games that I keep coming back to. This game is full of variety and depth. The artwork is beautiful. The strategy and tactics vary tremendously and you can find a hundred different ways to combine races, classes, and schools of magic. These combinations also play a role in what kind of special skills or abilities your units have. There are different kinds of games to play, with many customizable options.			"

												If you are a fan of 4x games, Civilization, or turned based games in general - this game should be at the top of your list. What really has me coming back is the art direction and randomized maps.-Highly engaging and complex tactical combat (Flanking, Magic, Damage types, Diversity in playstyles)-Interesting strategic variety on the world map-Best art direction in the strategy genre - this cannot be overemphasized!-Highly randomized maps and world editor for infinite replayability*UPDATE* - 04/2015 - BETA PATCH 1.5The developers have consistently made large updates to the game and it has turned into a classic that will be played for years to come. Issues Addressed-1. Tier 4 units toned down - better insentives through veterancy to keep lower tier units alive.2. Large balance tweaks - has resulted in better balance in multiplayer games.3. Diplomacy expanded  - more diplomacy options and nuanced vassal system.4. Interface improved - Cloth map (strategic map) has icons that mark out dwellings and treasure.ETERNAL LORDSAn absolutely huge expansion with all the meat you would expect from a full-blown old school style expansion; a new race, new specializations, new buildings and new units to do battle against.

												Like Civilization, but fantasy. You get to choose from a range of races and hero classes. Classes include the Dreadnought, a poweful inventor that rules through machines. The Rogue, that hides in the shadows, attacking their enemies when they least suspect it. Warriors, mighty heroes that seek out power through raw strength. Sorcerer, a conjurer of magic, capable of summoning gigantic minions that would make even the bravest of men flee. Theocrats, which believe in the holy gods, often aligning with the good side rather than the bad. And the ArchDruid, a class that prefers nature over machines. They can call fourth the powers of nature to turn the tides in battle. The races include Humans, Draconians, Drawves, High Elves, Orcs and Goblins. Then there are hero traits. Three can be chosen, which will lead to new spells and units being available. I would highly recommend this game while it's on special.			"

												I played this game right after playing Galatic Civilation III. It is very similar yet vastly different.Its much simpler, in the fact you don't have to micro manage little things (Unless you really want to) and the fact that the controls are streamlined.I love the different heros and classes and the fact that you can make your own is so much fun. The fact I can make these vast armies lead by such interesting and diverse heros riding on horses drakes and boars. One of my favorite things to do after getting a bunch of heros is going to assault fortresses, because you need to send different units to different walls and makes flanking a vital (and FUN) tactic!However, I will admit its so simple it feels sort of cheap at times. I haven't played long so this may be my own ignorance to certain features, but at times I feel I have a lack of control over development of my cities. For example, I'm not entirely sure how to increase my currency gains, or increase production and research rates.Lastly, THIS GAME IS GORGEOUS! It is so good looking for a turned based empire builder that its actually distracting! I love it! Each city looks fantastic, mines have productive animations, the abandoned fortresses, crypts and dungeons look appropriately mystic and intimadating; its like playing on a masterpiece!			"

												Favorite fantasy turn-based strategy rpg since Lords of Magic.  Waited 16 years for this - a true successor complete with modern 3D graphics.  You want to start from nothing and grow to a magnificent empire spreading your influence across the map - check.Level up heroes of different types each of unique races with several classes with many abilities - check.Research improvements to your units, new spells, and build fortresses, watchtowers, and even build new cities - check.Change the environment to suit your needs or make the land inhospitable to others - check.Participate in the defense of your cities defending against the monsterous hordes or lead an epic siege against the enemy - check.Can equip your heroes and leader with artifacts (items) to make them more powerful by increasing stats, granting new abilities, and even entirely new mounts for them to ride on - checkYes Age of Wonders 3 is everything I wanted in a game and it actually turned out to be better than I expected!  I eagerly await the next expansion or new game in the series ;)			"

The early game is a bit unforgiving as you learn the ropes, but as you play you learn, and as you learn you conquer, and as you conquer, you become more and more familiar with the beauty that is this game. everything from minor choices made, to alliances forged and pacts broken, chances are you will find yourself enthralled in ensuring your kingdom thrives and outwits all who would stand before it. i give this game a hands down 10/10 however it's up to you to decide for yourself wether you agree with my score :)			"

												One of the best turn-based strategy games with a wonderful fantasy setting. If you liked Heroes of Might and Magic or CIV then I have to recommend this game. The most important feature of AoW3 might be the creation process of your leader. Like in roleplay games you can choose out of 9 different races, 7 different classes, a view traits and many styles. The combination of race and class can lead to a very stereotypical warrior-like orc-empire or to a holy goblin-nation of saints. Its up to you. The focus is a bit more in fighting compared to CIV, nevertheless there are four different ways to win. Also there is great campagne and online-community too. Buy this game.			"

You can play as Humans, High Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Goblins, Draconians in the base game and Halflings with the expansion, Golden Realms. You can also create and customize a hero and the starting class can change how the different races play entirely. The classes include Arch Druid, Dreadnought, Rogue, Sorceror, Theocrat and Warlord and each feel very different. 4/5 stars for me.			"

Where its contemporary peers are much better at the empire-building part of 4x, this one has a very fun, satisfying battle system that takes place in what seems to be an extradimensional battlefield, so that you have plenty of space to work with and stuff. It's got a nice fun potential to build strong heroes with specific roles if you choose to do so and random loot, which is something everyone loves I believe.			"

												One of the best turn-based strategy games with a wonderful fantasy setting. If you liked Heroes of Might and Magic or CIV then I have to recommend this game. The most important feature of AoW3 might be the creation process of your leader. Like in roleplay games you can choose out of 9 different races, 7 different classes, a view traits and many styles. The combination of race and class can lead to a very stereotypical warrior-like orc-empire or to a holy goblin-nation of saints. Its up to you. The focus is a bit more in fighting compared to CIV, nevertheless there are four different ways to win. Also there is great campagne and online-community too. Buy this game.			"

												Complex and Beautiful, two words that quickly and simply describe this game. and with an expansion drawing ever closer it truthfully is a great time to buy this gem of a game, it is a great 4X game (4X for those unfamiliar with the genre means eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) on par with the amazing Civ series of games. it may not be as complex or in-depth as previous installments to the series but is a great starting point for people who are new to AoW or new to a 4X game in general. The early game is a bit unforgiving as you learn the ropes, but as you play you learn, and as you learn you conquer, and as you conquer, you become more and more familiar with the beauty that is this game. everything from minor choices made, to alliances forged and pacts broken, chances are you will find yourself enthralled in ensuring your kingdom thrives and outwits all who would stand before it. i give this game a hands down 10/10 however it's up to you to decide for yourself wether you agree with my score :)			"

												A great successor to the original AoW games...and after so many years! When I first heard that the game was going into production, and that the same ORIGINAL TEAM, plus new additions, were working on it...my mind was blown.This, I thought, is fan service done right. And I was not disappointed. The AoW franchise has always been a cult classic in the SRPG genre; hell, they helped CREATE the genre, and with AoW3, they show that they still have the magic. The game itself is beautiful, especially the battlegrounds, the voice acting is superb, combat is deep and highly strategic, and the hero customization is great. This is a fantastic game in every way			"

												It's almost criminal the way this game is underrated. This is easily one of my favorite strategy games of all time and I can't seem to understand why not many have noticed it. Instead of a cheap♥♥♥♥♥battle animations you actually get to take control of your units, so you'll be able to turn situations where you are outnumbered 3 to 1 and still pull out a victory (if you're good enough). Granted it's not total war levels of control but it's still better than civ5.If you don't have this game, get of your♥♥♥♥♥and buy it already. "

												Do NOT purchase this game if you're planning to play mainly singleplayer! The AI is infuriatingly cheap and cheats like crazy. It gets resource bonuses and can see the entire map at all times. In the campaigns, enemies get such resource and army advantages it's ridiculous. A typical scenario is you starting with your hero and maybe an army, while the AI starts with 3 cities, 5 armies and only grows from there. Tedious and frustrating. Avoid!			"

												I've found this game to be a true gem and quite addicting. While I often use auto-combat there are times where manual combat is a must and it's quite enjoyable. The MP is solid but the SP truly shines. There are numerous options to setup an exciting game both on and offline but there are still a few kinks (that may have already been fixed by this posting) with SP campaign objectives and oddly enough how hard it pushes your system. Still, it is a must buy sale or not!			"

												It's a nice take on the AoW formula, and if you're craving for something new in this regard, it's probably worth a try.However, the game has a couple of serious problems, that in the end, made me go back to previous AoW titles and HoMM.  UI is all over the place  Most units are quite literally copy-pasted between each factions  AI is utterly predictable and leader classes are unbalanced.  UnoptimizedThe UI, you can get used to. But I still can't stop shaking my head, at how they managed to make it bare-bones and cluttered at the samt time. It's just not focused, and some elements are all over the place, instead of having a designated place for similar elements(like in Civ5, or Endless Legend for example.) Some things are even shown twice, as if they couldn't decide where to put them.The unit situation is something I couldn't get used to though. They are simply copy-pasted between factions, and this is where it gets ugly: they even look the same. Sure, Orcs are green, and Dwarfs are short and stocky, but they still share the same units, wearing the exact same equipment. They tried to make this more bearable with faction traits(Elves for example don't like to fight underground) or leader specific units. But it's a bare minimum, that doesn't help in that regard.The AI has only two modes: go full force, or sit there and watch you steamroll the map. It's really that simple. The difficulty doesn't change this, but rather gives them bonuses(gold & production, start with larger armies) and that's where the devs called it a day. And if you want an easy win, just play Warlord class. Because the classes are unbalanced and exploitable.Optimization... well this game has none. I'm running this on a i7 3,4GHz, R9270, 8GB, Win8.1/10 Pro x64, and I only make around 30-40fps.  I looked this up on the forums and Google, and apparently there's no real reason behind it. For some people it just runs great, for others it just doesn't, completely independent from the PC specs. Literally what the term ""unoptimization"" is for.And to top things off, you can even find a cynical thread on the Steamforums, in which the devs joined in on making fun of those concerned about bad performance. Really nice move...In the end, AoW3 just isn't a game that's worth playing over already existing 4X titles. Especially if you're a fan of the old AoW, HoMM, or moved on to EL. It just doesn't offer enough to stand out. Really, the biggest thing it has going for it, is it's existence, since many people considered the AoW franchise to be dead.			"

												It's a lot like Civ, if Civ were all about military stuff. In other words, less interesting Civ. Simplified economy, no culture, research only serves your military, diplomacy is only whether you're at war or not, the only reason to build buildings is to build units slightly differently. . . The turn-based combat is decent, but gets old real fast, with how much of it you do.			"

												I loved age of wonders 2 tremendously -- and what distinguished it from the rest of the turn based strats out there at the time was the GIGANTIC flexability you had in designing your leaders, the variety of abilities for characters, and how that effected how you lead your armies. I simply cannot understand how so many design choices could have been made to NARROW your selection and agency. It was also disheartening to see the narrow choices of campaigns......and when you start to play? it looks like warcraft 2. AoW has eschewed it's own personality (even if it might not have been as flashy) for an analog of another popular game. Blaff.			"

												This review of for Age of Wonders III on OS X.This game seems extremely interesting and full of promise.  I played the original Age of Wonders years ago and have long since lost touch with the franchise.  I find many things to like about the game design, in particular how most actions you will take will effect your good/evil rating such that over time you are seen by others as either a good guy or a bad guy.  The map is interesting to explore, with lots of strange and menacing discoveries to make.  The AI seems pretty good.Unfortunately on my recent iMac running OS X 10.10, the game runs terribly, worse than any game I have ever tried to play on this machine.  It goes without saying that I am forced under such circumstances to turn the graphics quality all the way down (which leaves the game looking like an early 90's game, and not in a charming retro way), but even with these measures taken, the game is either borderline unplayable or completely unplayable, depending on your patience.  (Mine wore out after about 15 hours of gameplay marred by stuttering frame rates, slow screen redraws, unresponsive buttons due to lag and so on.)  Generally if I reboot the computer between sessions I can play for perhaps 20 minutes before the frame rate bogs down to the point of being unplayable.  I find that zooming out on the map causes the performance to plummet in such a way that it never recovers even after zooming back in to the normal perspective. Every time I exit the game I receive an error message that ""Age of Wonders III unexpectedly quit"", which is a good sign that all is not right with this build.  With the issues I encountered I can't recommend this game to any Mac players whatsoever.			"

												If you enjoyed the first Age of wonders game, but did not like the next two, as me my father, my brother, and a friend of ours did. this game is not the game for you.  tactical combat is limited, the maps are smaller then age of wonders 1, if you surround a city in units they will all end up in the same hex when attacking, and the game places your units how it feels like, so makeing specialised partys in large battles and balanceing them means nothing, and troop placement doesnt mean much as the deffenders can offten run up and fire on you on there first turn preventing you from even haveing time to manuver your troops into the battleformation you desire. the tactical map is about the size of 2 hexes compared to age of wonders 1... you cant even fight in the city. only along side the walls and on the outside of the walls.health bars in battles are tiny, so bad that you must click on units to see there hp.. the flanking system is broken as the unit attacked spends a movement to face the unit that flanks them. pretty stupid to see a unit turn its back on 4 units with backstab becasue an archer took a pot shot from a bad spot.units dont poke out on the map becasue the map is so 3d in the same way the units are, the units should poke out so they are not lost... or hidden. everything looks like its the same shade of color, and that doesnt help either.all attacks hit, only the damage is effected by cover and whatever, units in the way of other units dont have a chance of takeing the hit for the intended unit, so you can gaurd archers with whatever unit you want to give them the bonus with no risk of loseing them, just put a 1 hp dicklord infront and he will have to be attacked first... how does a unit reduce the chance of another unit geting hit by a ranged attack by standing in front of it without a chance to get hit???!research is random, you research something, then something random fills its slot. before what you reserched was importantcombat is very rock paper sissors, instead of units naturaly being better at takeing out other units they add in stats that only benifit units,   before attacking a unit with first strike with a flyer was a bad idea becasue it removed the good thing about flying, (picking off weak units) now attacking a first stiker with a flyer makes the first striker do more damage.weak units cant be protected by walls or moved back as all attacks are garenteed hits.... in fact with garenteed hits low hp units are pretty worthless they are just meat shields, they cant retaliate back cuze they are dead. instead of, oh, i could miss and then get hit in retaliation so this 1hp super monster is still kinda dangourus and i should pick it off with archers..

												This is a remake of one of my favourite old-timey games; Master of Magic.  Age of Wonders III, has faithfully preserved the features of the original, which I think is a good decision.  Sometimes people just hit the nail on the head, so why stray too far from a winning formula.That's not to say that Age of Wonders III hasn't made improvements along the way.  The tactical battles are especially good.I have experienced some of the bugginess that others have experienced as well (my computer would reboot suddenly).  Mine got solved (fingers crossed) without too much fuss, but from what I read it looks as though the studio is willing to work with people to help things get fixed.If you don't experience any bugs I give this game an unequivocal endorsement.  If you do experience bugs, I think it's worth it to fight through the pain and get it running smoothly.			"

												Anyone else finding themselves not blown away by this?  The units lost that hand-drawn feel from AOW 1, and the variety we saw with all the races in AOE 2/Shadow Magic.Which race you pick matters less than the type of magician you chose to be, and melts away a lot of the variety.Battles are frustrating and repetitive.  You're constantly swimming upstream against an incredibly fast current in the later missions (the current being neverending streams of elite armies pouring out of the NPC enemies' territory).  After the 10th time fighting several full stacks of whatever those jesus boxes are called, you want to try something new, or at least auto-calc the battle, but you can't afford the casualties they'll inflict on you, so back again to the grind, where the finicky hit system will drive you nuts.I don't know.  Maybe I'm somehow not getting it, but it seems like the Endless series just does a better job at keeping things fun and interesting.  Or maybe I'm meant to buy the game a few more times to get enough variety from the DLC's.			"

												The promise of the game is fun, but their stupid difficulty curves make it not fun at all, the second mission in the easy campaign just crushes you.

												Don't believe the hype. AoW3 is great.You should get it if you like turn based fantasy strategy.This game is NOT Civilization.  It never was.  Don't expect to be, or you'll be disappointed.  THIS IS AGE OF WONDERS!It's like epic chess.  Vast board, upgradable pieces, magic and NPC's, and adventure.  Everything you wanted chess to be as a kid!  And like chess it can be brutally unforgiving.  save well, save often!There are precious few games I would pay full price for pre-release, but I was a HUGE fan of AoW 1& 2.  And I knew it would be worth it.  For fans of the series - the same classic game is here, although certain aspects have changed.  Much like between 1 &2!  I have yet to play through but have enjoyed it.			"

												AoW II has long been my favorite turn-based strategy toping even the Civilization franchise, and this game is a worthy follow up, going even further. The biggest plus is a well made storyline and campaigns with multiple endings. I heard the expansions are filled with new content and it all runs really smooth, so I'm hoping to play them soon as well. Would recommend to ever strategy/fantasy lover			"

												Good game, but a little shy on the empire building for my taste.  There are no other victory conditions other than war.  The spells are very cool.  Your faction is a combination of your race and class although over all they are all very similar, seems more just for flare.  The combat is decent if a little simple.  I love the multilayer map, it reminds me of master of magic from years past.  All in all a good game!			"

												I'm really enjoying this so far. It reminds me of a mix of the total war games and civilization and a touch of dungeons and dragons. It's a role playing game as well as a strategy game and those are my top 2 favorite genres so this is really awesome in my opinion.It has a slight learning curve but it's fairly easy to pick up and play. The tutorial isn't really necessary if you've played games similar to this one in the past but it still is worth it to check it out. Even if you're only interested in the story aspect of the tutorial.The graphics are good, the combat is absolutely awesome, and the amount of things you can do in the game is amazing.This is easily one of my new favorites.

												Do NOT pay full price for this game. It is nowhere near worth the £30 asking price, but that said, it's still a good bit of mindless fun. A fairly obvious clone of parts of Civs 4 and 5, with heavy fantasy elements. The game looks gorgeous, and runs well, but is heavily lacking in depth and polish. There are some finicky ways in which you have to micro manage things. Builder units cannot have their orders queued up, so if you're building, for example, a long road, you have to give the builder the order to build a road every turn, rather than giving it to them once at the start of the road and the builder autobuilds to the end. The custom-map menu doesn't lock in your settings from use to use, and the amount of times I've forgotten to change one of about three things, and had to restart a game to change simultaneous turns (which I cannot stand, and as I've said, is the default setting which can't be changed) is ridiculous. These are just a couple of ways in which the game lacks polish. Depth, as I have mentioned, is also sorely lacking. All cities can only build the same buildings, aside from buildings coming from the racial and class bonuses of your leader. Any variation of cities only comes from the bonus improvements in the land around them. These are in the game from the beginning, and cannot be created, destroyed, or changed. You cannot build farms or any other kind of improvement as in Civ, but are limited to Watchtowers, Fortresses and roads. Roads don't give any sort of bonus, other than your units moving faster. There is no negative effect to having more cities as in Civ, where tech costs and such go up. In AoW3, having fewer cities isn't a playstyle. You want to expand as fast and as much as possible. So yeah. Lacks polish. Lacks depth. Is still a lot of mindless fun. It looks gorgeous and it works. I recommend this game, but get it on sale. It is nowhere near worth £30.			"

												A Review For Older Gamers: This is a good game, After 26 hours, I haven't seen any bugs, play is smooth, and there is great depth, well sort of.After playing for 5 hours, it is easy to get bored. You load up a new battle instance (yes - instance), place your units and move this unit, cast a spell with that, shoot with this one, click next turn. After a few turns the battle is over. Now it is time to move your units around the big map, make a quick empire-building move (maybe tell your city what to build next) and BACK TO BATTLE. That's all this game is: over and over, the same freaking battlefield instance with a few slightly different skins. Oooh! This time the battlefield instance has palm trees blocking the way instead of pillars of rock! Oooh!After 12 hours, you see there is a bit more to this game. Leveling up hero units, planning where to build cities on the big map, some exploration. After 25 hours, it becomes apparent that the decent amount of depth to the game barely matters. It is all elves and halflings and necromancers and eagle mounts and spider mounts and cities with walls that you break with trebuchets. It has been done so many times before, that even though they do a good job, it is just boring. The tired old tropes of spell casters and healers and warlords, mana potions and fairies and wisps and goblins...there is no WONDERMENT in Age of Wonders! It should be called Fellowship of the Ring, episode 293. And that includes having bought both DLC.When I  play ARK: Suvival Evolved, my jaw was constantly hanging open. Everywhere you turn, dinosaurs, fishing, sea diving, changing weather, stuff I had NOT done ten million times before. This game is the opposite of that, at least if you have read all the Tolkien books, seen all the movies, played all the games. Tired subject matter makes for a boring game. And the soundtrack is anything but exciting. The music never once lifts you up or tries to put you in a good mood. This is THINKING music. Furrow-your-brow, get a headache from thinking too hard for hours on end kind of music. Bleh! BORING!It is a polished, fun game, and even I will probably enjoy 100 or 200 hours in it, but only as a break from other games with more staying power. This game tries to be Medieval Civilization. To its credit, it is as well-polished as CIV, but it is too one-dimensional. Very little time is spent building the empire. Partly because they didn't build the tools you need to manage your empire. No over-riding view of research window where you can hang out and plan ahead, strategize. The in-game help is a little weak. Most of your time is in cookie-cutter *instanced* combat, which is fine, but deciding yet again how to flank a dragon and draw him out of volvanic lands into the fertile grassland your elven cavalry and druid prefer is just so totally yesterday, that even though this is a good game, I just can't bring myself to recommend it. Except on deep discount with no expectation of staying power. If you're going to remake Dungeons & Dragons One. More. Time., you should build the hell out of the game. Make it so you can rename your heros or at least enter notes so you can tell at a glance ""oh yeah, this is my dude with high fire resistance."" If you're not going to customize each heros character data sheet, at least ORGANIZE it so the important stuff is easy to find! The unit's ability to WALK isn't that interesting to me. Could you maybe not put that at the top? Let me click that slider bar and drag down til I find... oh there it is... no, this hero  can't buff his squad with extra damage... where is the dude who can? If this were 5 years ago, I'd say buy it. Today, this is just boring. Like your third replay of the entire Breaking Bad series on Netflix. Don't do it!Married people cheat on their spouse because they get bored and want something new. In the real world, there are reasons that gets complicated. In the fantasy world however, the excitement of getting some strange should be easy. Why isn't it? This game is good.... good in the way that sex with your wife of 22 years is also good. Yawn!! That was great! ...again. Yawn!! I'm sorry honey. But I know you understand. We've been married so long, you understood ten years ago. Want to watch some t.v.?			"

												Note: This is only a single-player review. I usually don't do multiplayer in games.TL;DR: Runs a bit slow on my rig, which is somewhere between potato and top of the line. Graphics people mostly did their job. Music is good. Campaign programmers and AI programmers did pretty bad. All of the scant voice acting is done with a British accent. The major challenge with the AI is its cheating, so I ended up spending my time figuring out how to exploit the AI and keep it from exploiting its advantages. 100 hours of frustration.Longer:Graphics: Not top of the line, but strategy games have never been about graphics. There are a few areas, like jungles and tombs, where battlefield objects make it difficult to see the map. Naval battles involving units aboard ships are also difficult because it's difficult to tell units apart.Sound: I play with volume low, but the music was neither annoying nor engrossing. Lets you focus on other stuff while adding atmosphere. Unit sounds are also good, like shamans casting magic streams making a 'whoosh!' sound.Campaign-related categories:Story: Cliché shadow organization, stop a war-type deal. Win every battle for no good reason against sometimes ridiculous odds.Level layout: I could complain about this for hours. The basic requirement for most missions is the same: capture the enemy capital while the leader's recovering from defeat. They like to hide the capital either underground or on the other side of impassible mountains and you find the teleport to get to them. Maps also tend to be very large, with a lot of hindering terrain (mountains, islands[it takes all move points to enter water]) that makes an already slow game even more so. The layout alone would make the experience tedious.Level layout(2): The AI starts with most of the map under its control, and has a very strong economy to build units and perform research. In most maps, all players start with no research done, and a small army. This alone wouldn't be a bad thing, and it's done in a lot of great games: Warcraft, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, BUT the enemies have the tech and economic advantage, so you've got to be getting favorable trades in battles, and losing a single major battle pretty much means 'load your save or restart'. On its own, this would put some pressure on the player.AI: This is the worst, most cheating AI I've seen in a strategy game. Though I haven't played Civilization V; I've heard it is ridiculous. This AI is all-seeing and acts on it. If you have half the map and decide to station units in cities on or near the border, the computer will immediately send a single unit between your defended cities to claim your defenseless ones, trying to stay out of view as long as possible. If you capture a city and don't leave defenders, the computer will immediately send units to take it back. To the best of my knowledge, it's never mentioned that the AI can see everything. It's a frustrating learning experience asking ""How did the computer sneak that unit in to take my town?"", then ""How did it know my city was empty?"", and ""How did it know my city existed!?"", possibly ""How did the computer know a city could even be there!?"". There's a stand-alone scenario 'Taming the Great Kahn' that frustrates many. I've turned off the fog-of war just to watch the computer players beeline to the important stuff in an absurd way. The computer never scouts, but even for defended cities, it will bring enough units thoroughly beat you if you set the fight to auto-battle. If you bring reinforcements that will arrive in time, the computer will bring its own reinforcements before attacking, despite the fact it shouldn't know your reinforcements are on the way. I'll skip the rest of the examples, but there's not even a player option to turn off the fog of war (though there is a cheat code), presumably to hide how horrendous the AI is.The computer seems to decide to attack based on some simple algorithm, like their unit_count*avg_hp*avg_defense*avg_attack vs. your stats in the same style. So their five swordsmen will take on your four archers, and four of them will get picked off before they get into melee range. The tactical AI priority seems to be (1)Heal; (2)Buff/Debuff; (3)Attack the highest priority unit in range (usually support or heroes, and the computer will take a lot of damage to do so sometimes); (4)get into attack range. Basically 'Buff 'n Rush'. You often won't notice in the campaign, though, because you'll often be positioning your units to somehow try to win every fight at 2-to-1 odds.I have a feeling that random events, called 'Cosmic Events', are generated to help the computer; any benefit to you is a side-effect. I used armies of fragile and weak ranged units to take on superior armies of tough, strong melee units. An event reduces all dealt damage by 3, reducing my units' damage by about 60%, and theirs by ~15%. The next event gave +5 to melee damage. The next event reduced vision range by 2 (refer to all-seeing AI for why this only hurts human players).Every campaign mission is like the most notorious mission in Heroes of Might and Magic V, the Agrael vs. Gilraen mission, pre-patch, for those who played that game. If your preferred tactic is rushing and aggression, the campaign is easy. If you prefer to build up and tech up, you'll lose until you learn to rush aggressively. Each mission seems best played twice on normal difficulty. The first time you sacrifice your cities and try to find the shortest path to your main objective before you lose. The second time you keep 2-3 units at each of your cities and move the bulk of your army in a desperate attempt at a decapitation strike. Rinse and repeat four times (the first mission is easier, though it tries to bore you by making you go in a 'U' shape around the map).Miscellaneous:Due to the haste of single-player, you don't really get to explore the tech tree. The enemy often does, because they're researching at 2x-3x your speed. This isn't about not getting the whole tech tree, the problem is that you usually don't even get to the end of a single branch, so why are those options there?To be fair, I do have horrible luck in life. I may have completed the worst campaign and wasted days on the worst scenario in the game. Unfortunately, from my experience, what could have been a wonderful strategy game with slick moves and fantastic creatures ends up feeling more like pushing a heavy barrel uphill on a road with a strong storm pushing you back and threatening to crush you. Sadly, a cheap Civ knockoff, even worse because I'd prefer magic and fantasy over historically inaccurate pikemen vs. tanks.			"

												I realise this isn't going to be a popular review but the fact remains that I've never really understood the appeal of the AoW series. When it first came out it was graphically and playability-wise behind the times and very little has changed as far as I can tell. This is not to say that I think AoW3 is a bad game by any stretch, I just feel that the whole genre isn't producing anything new any more. If I had to pick a ""best"" out of a slew of civ clones I would likely choose Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes over this. You can go on about oldies like Master of Magic or newer attempts such as Endless Legend...none of which are BAD games...it's just...ugh..this again? When all is said and done none of them really have the depth of even the earliest Total War games and haven't progressed in any big way since the original Civilization. Learn the basics...build powerful armies, click auto resolve, repeat until so bored that you dribble like Homer Simpson thinking of gravy. For me, at least, this isn't gravy - more like early onset senility. Sorry fanboys it's just my opinion.			"

												I sadly can't recommend this game, I feel as if they really screwed us on content compared the the pervious Age of Wonders games, which each offered a massive variety of races and customization. The classes you can pick are extremely uninteresting and they removed many of my favourite races such as Dark Elves and Undead with no explanation, promising us DLC that will bring in more races and classes. I believe like the feeling of customization was very important in the previous Age of Wonders games, and this one tried to fix something that wasn't broken and ruined the game. That, or the devs simply got very lazy and assumed a shiny new graphic style would cover up all the cons.The game does look pretty, some of the additions are nice, however this simply isn't a good game, at least compared to the previous installments. I also hate the fact that they promise us features that should have been in since release as paid DLC. I would suggest Shadow Magic over this any day, simply because I feel it has more content and is a much more enjoyable game overall. "

												This is not a particularly deep or challenging game.  None of the units are very interesting and most of the game is just spent building up a horde of basically interchangable units and hoping that your horde is bigger than the other guy's.  It is a very poor substitute for Heroes of Might and Magic.			"

												My boyfriend gifted this game to me, as we were both looking for something fun to play together and it looked fun.  Other people said it was fun too; the reviews seemed good.  It's compeltely unplayable though.  I checked the system specs before hand.  I have a good computer.  I've run other, more intricate games before with no problem, but the fps on this was like 2.  I closed all the windows I had open.  I checked all my stuff to see if anything needed updating.  Nothing fixed it.  So I thought, I've only had it running for 20 min, surely I can get a refund done so the boyfriend won't have completely wasted his money, but steam doesn't do that either.  I wasted an extra hour just trying to figure out how.  Now my only day off's almost over and my plans of having fun video game time with the boy all night are ruined and I don't think we'll buy anything from steam again.			"

If you have strong troops you win, if you dont you loss. no big troop unqueness. ranged or melee. fly or walk. I was really hoping for troops that had special abilities.its no wonder they put in an auto resolve for battles. Battles are boring and the ones you need to fight cuz you cant risk losing are usually way too long.i guess i was looking for an new kings bounty or might and magic. this game is more like civilaztion.

												The gameplay is ok. The stories are fine if not a bit old. The graphics aren't much to be spoken for. The real kicker is how the AI simply creates gigantic titles of the best tier units they can possibly afford. As such the battles, while at first are very appealing and fun quickly become a grudge match. You throw as many of your best spells and units that you can dredge up at the AI and they throw theys back at you. This all just dissavolves into a ""last man standing"" battle where tactics are thrown out the window and the only use for lower tiered infantry is cannon fodder. More or less literally depening on your opponent.			"

												This is a beautiful character creator with an extremely deep concept... attached to a totally crap game engine. The character creator is so promising and varied it's hard not to keep going back and trying to find that ""sweet spot"" that makes the rest of the game playable, but it isn't there. This game sucks. Maybe future updates will get around to making it not suck so much but so far it's a steaming heap with one of the best character creators I've yet seen on a 4X game.It's a mediocre alternative to Fallen Enchantress, the difference being primarily that Fallen Enchantress is a playable (though not terribly fun) 4x game with low-end graphics and boring gameplay. What AoW3 brings to the table is prettier artwork... and almost nothing else, as yet.Considering it's been in a ""finished product"" state for over a year now and already has content updates, I've got little hope that it's actually going to be upgraded to a ""decent"" game at any point. It's a bad game... but again, the graphics are pretty and the character creator is top-notch.[EDIT]: I really want to love this game, I really do... I've given it a solid 80 hours of trying now, and I still can't do it. I've worked out how to stack starting conditions and faction options in a manner that allows me to eventually sometimes expand beyond my first city before getting overrun by wandering barbarian hordes... I've learned how to exploit the subterranean map for everything it's worth... I've figured out dwellings and their various diplomatic side-effects... I've even learned how to mix the various magical schools and which race/class combinations benefit more or less from several varieties of pre-game picks selections. I've also discovered now how to make use of the ""growth momentum"" meta-economic (which has no indicators, and is not apparent because there is no 'development tree' of any kind on cities, units, magic, or otherwise... it's just implied by one stage unlocking another one as you progress) and I've figured out how to use hero hiring to ""blend strategies"" for empire development......but even through all of that, the game is still... shallow like a puddle on the sidewalk. It's got no depth. City specialization boils down to placement near world-bound resources like ""dungeons"" and ""tombs"" and such. While you can do a tiny bit of terraforming, it's extremely restricted (you can change the surface mapping of a tile amongst a limited range of options based on your initial picks, you cannot raise and lower terrain and you cannot branch your empire out across multiple environs). The morale system is disappointing in a variety of ways, and makes the initial starting conditions extremely unbalancing if you do not rig the game heavily in your favor before you even begin.As a final note, the artwork is absolutely fantastic, I can't say that enough. This is probably the most beautiful 4X currently on the market... but that's all it's really got going for it. The UI is counter-intuitive, the gameplay dynamics are so biased that every game is a foregone conclusion before you even begin, and the development/progress system is literally a flatline rather than any kind of curve.The people working on this game seem to be missing a critical element from their team... it's like a bunch of art students tried to make a game none of them would ever actually play. It's got no passion, no depth, no sense of accomplishment, no actual challenge, no emotional value.It isn't a problem with the engine, it isn't a problem with the graphics. It's just a complete lack of engagement between design and implementation.			"

												This game is very well polished, but it just turns into a grind so quickly.  It's really bad that, in the campaign, the only way to win each mission is to capture every city on the map.  There's no unique or interesting win conditions, just total conquest, and about 25% of the way through the time you'll spend on each mission, you become unstoppable and just spend the rest of the time mopping up.The combat system is superb, but it becomes grindy after the 10th overwhelming victory on your turn.  You will eventually just auto-resolve every combat to save time, which takes the joy out of the best part of the game.			"

												There are a lot of good games in this genre. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. It is boring and simplistic compared to many others in the genre. It is trying to be a cross between a Civ game and something like the King's Bounty games or Heroes of Might and Magic and the crossover just ends up being the most mediocre of both worlds. For example, research consists of picking one of 12 seemingly random choices of spells or empire upgrades. There is no clear progression of research, it's just picking whichever random ability you want to research and most of them don't have a noticeably huge impact. Even worse than the annoying research system is the city development system. Your options for developing your cities are almost identical, no matter what race you are playing as. Every race gets 1 archer, 1 infantry unit, 1 irregular, 1 pikeman, 1 calvary unit, 1 siege tower, 1 support unit, and 1 special racial troop. The only differences between them for the different races are the traits they have and those don't have a huge difference. The class you choose for your hero has a bigger effect on what units you can build than your race but even that isn't much. No matter what class you pick, it adds 3 new building options to your city that must be built in order. Those buildings are what allow you to produce your class specific units. For the magical classes, that may be only 1 unit because you can use spells to summon more. For the non-magical classes, you get a few more troops but ultimately it is still an unsatisfying number of choices.The one thing I do like about this game is that if multiple armies are in hexes next to the army being attacked, you can have more troops in combat than a single army can have in it. However, combat still feels like a rather boring clone of King's Bounty or Heroes of Might and Magic's combat system. I'm not saying that those games are bad, just that this doesn't bring anything new to the combat table.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game at all. You want to manage an empire, there are better games for that. You want to have turn based roleplaying game with tactical combat, there are better games for that. If you want to play both in the same game, then unfortunately this is the only game I know of for you but that doesn't means it's a good choice.			"

												I would not recommend this game, for singleplayer. There are a few issue's i have that cause me not to enjoy this game.Warning: this is highly subjective, based on personal experience. Therefore i recommend keeping that in mind!- First the depth.When you start the game and see all the different races and the specialisations you may get the idea that there's alot to discover. However every race play's very alike, there are differences ofcourse but the general concept is the same throughout. (swordsman, archer, pikeman, horseman etc). The specialisations do bring some variation but the research-tree's attached to them are short. The extra units for each specialisation is a welcome addition, however it's not quite enough.- Combat/balance.The combat has some meat to it, it's the focus of the game. Some interesting mechanics suchs as attacks of oportunity and hero skills add to the strategic element. But because of the low variety of units it becomes more of the same much too soon.-Pacing.The big focus in this game is as i said the combat. Sadly around turn 50-60 all units but tier 4 units get less usefull. Wichs results in tier 4 unit spam, it takes away from the already limited choise and variation. And for me that is were most of my games ended, because i did not feel like spamming one unit.- Diplomacy.Diplomacy is barebone in this game, it's about declaring war or signing a peace treaty. You can interact some more with independant city's, like vasalisation. But when you tend to wage war everyone will like you less, making it harder to have good relations with anyone (as a war decleration effects every other player/independant) it's simply the most viable mechanic by far to just wage war as the only option. - Strategic placement.This is combat related, you get to choose 6 unit's for each stack. Then you can fight with multiple stacks in one fight to up to (i believe) 48 units. This sounds very nice but there's a big problem that i personally have with it.If you fight with 2 stacks versus one the AI tends to advance towards one of them. That leaves the other to catch up since the distance between allied stacks is relatively large. Because of that the reason to fight with multiple stacks becomes less important, your main stack is gonna do most of the work (hopefully, the AI might attack the other stack). Or the AI splits it's army destroying it's chances on it's own.In encounters (versus independants roaming or placed around the map) the battlefield is so small that ranged units can reach your army in the first turn. And they get to go first because you attacked. So they get a free attack in.... does not seem very strategic.- City defense.This seems to be done by placing units within the city, wich cost upkeep. The AI will ninja your city, it even intends to do so. The only way is to use units wich should have bin fighting in your army, there should be a building for it, but none to find.-Graphics.This is done fairly well, the game does look beautifull and the animation quality is high. It also runs very well and support for the game is good, the devs are very active and helpful!All in all i expected something along the lines of Warlock or HoMM. But this is a different creature entirely. That said the issue's i have may not be a problem for others, as many people do like this game. And for good reason, i did like aspects of it very much. Sadly the points mentioned made it not so enjoyable for me personally.I would not recommend unless none of the above is an issue, if you do get it i'd recommend to wait for a sale (it happends frequently)!

												In order to do Age of Wonders III justice, I would have to write two reviews. The tactical layer works very well. The strategic layer doesn't. Regardless of whether I recommend this game or not, I'm letting my opinion on one subsystem trump the other.The tactical layer uses a fun and flexible system that involves frequent trade offs between moving fast and being able to deal damage. It encourages you to move your units carefully and orchestrate coordinated chains of actions. Unit types are well balanced against each other so that there really is a point to using a bit of everything. The spellcasting system is somewhat less robust and clearly favours damage dealing over buffs, but still provides added depth. All of this is made even better by varied tactical maps and enemy factions. This is game design at its best.It is, sadly, wasted to some degree, because the strategic layer is a classic case of form over essence. Strategic maps are large and full of landmarks, but there are no mechanics for making all this complexity ""observable"". You just keep stumbling upon things that hide in the fog of war - or they stumble upon you, usually at the least convenient time. There's no way for you to take all the necessary precautions, so you're often at the mercy of randomness. Most scenarios make assumptions with regard to optimal play style but never tell you about them. Sometimes you're supposed to rush. Sometimes you're supposed to turtle. Sometimes you need to clear NPC nests, and sometimes they are just red herrings. There's no feedback from the game's dynamics until it's too late. It's been over 70 hours and I'm still just picking city upgrades at random.So there's one system that works, and one that doesn't. The reason why I'm going for ""not recommended"" is the storyline and setting. It's childish, naive and not at all compelling; full of cliches, and saturated with casual imperialism. You could say storylines are not important in 4X games, but then why not just make a 4X game without a story, like good old Civilization or Master of Orion? If the story is important enough to justify preceding every mission with a five-minute, three-act briefing, then it should be judged just like a proper story that it's trying do be. Age of Wonders III fails miserably in this respect.Additionally, the game does a poor job at explaining its systems to the player. There's just a huge infodump of a manual that you're supposed to read, and the visual language takes some getting used to. It took me a good few hours to sort things out on my own.			"

												I have played the prior games of Age of Wonders and like the basic game.  This last one however is just a bug, bug,  bug filled mess.  It may be that there are to many connections required.  There is steam and also a second one for the game developer.  There might be problems with being sold an unfinished game.  I am not a tech person, but have played computer games for many years.  This one either gets a bug report or gets frozen about every twenty minutes.  The bug means you have to drop out of the game, reload and go back to your last save.  This takes about two to three minutes.  When the game gets frozen you have to shut down your computer and restart everything, for a five to six minute delay.  The condition of the game takes all of the fun out of playing.  Untill the thing is fixed you would be better off playing something else.			"

(Even TotalBiscuit mentioned heroes have perma-death, which is not/no longer the case. It is just that the technology to revive heroes is very high tier and therefore unless you play the game longer, you won't encounter it.)			"

												Good game overall but with some issues. The spell side has very little choice, no unit enchantments. In short a bit dumbed down from the previous version but still good enough. The major problem I have with it is how long it takes for the computer to take it's turns after you go into turns 90 or 50 (with the expansion) on extra large maps and 8 players. the game really drags down to make you wait over 5 minutes for your turn and the developers are simply unwilling to solve the problem... I'd give it a 7/10 for this reason as I only enjoy doing 8 players extra large maps and am forced to either not play or play into smaller maps that are unsatisfying for me... As you may have noticed, the expansion makes the slow pc turns get much worse and it doesn't adds that much to the game so be warned.			"

You can't do anything at all in that time except pan the map around, unless you're stuck in a menu, in which case you can do sweet eff-all.So no, with multiplayer code this primitive, I can't suggest you get it.

												sadly AoW3 took a stab at 4x and failed, every race has the same buildings at the start with only the special units that require something else to be built. theres no diversity like elves build trees for woodland creatures and orcs build mines for thier shock troops.gameplay is just build an army that can attack move it from city to city watch your cash and mana and hope someones flying unit doesnt break in the back door and take everything you have worked for. the resourses dont really allow for defensive units to be left guarding the cities you conquor so its hit and miss if you progress far in a very long time.low tier units are cheap but can be 1 shot killed by higher teirs so are completely redundant. just build tier 4 or higher armies, watch your gold and you're good. downside is you may need to wait several turns to heal before continuing and loosing just 1 unit can have a massive effect on your progress.12 hours of game play to hit mission 2.....some spells are completely useless as the AI will dispell everything on the next turn so waiting for the cost of it is just impractical and the banish spell never works on large monsters.currently stuck on the mission to capture the bad guys, the main baddie keeps dying to mission fails every time....could have been a lot better...

												I could write a very long review detailing all the problems, but I will keep it simple.First this is not an Age of Wonders game it just looks like one, on the cover and they used the name. Let me explain, 90% of what made all the other AoW games special is gone (multiple races each with its own troop types, three levels, and flaggable resourses just to name a few) whats left is so corrupted as to be nearly unAoW. Second Graphics they suck!! what you see above is not what you will get, on the world map it jerks around and after an hour of trying to look at it your eyes are so sore you want to dig them out of your head! Then there are the battles (two words) Multiple Sprites, who for the most part look similar to the enemy sprites, so hard to tell apart, much less tell what they are used for. Third THE EDITOR I make maps, I like making maps, with AoW 3 I can't make maps or at least not good ones (no F***ing instructions as far as I can see)There are some good things top one being the Jobs for the leaders its a nice touch but not enough to make up for the rest of this mess.My hope is that just like with AoW 2 they will realize mistakes and fix and reissue the game with no number just a cool name. Of couse that is a pipe dream because unlike AoW 2 that just needed to be polished better and have some content added. This crap fest would need an entire rewrite, remove mutiple sprites, remove systems stolen from other games that are five to fifteen years old ie. The area of control from Civilization three thru five worked for that game doesn't for this one - big time.Finally two things GIVE ME BACK MY HALFLINGS and GIVE ME BACK MY UNDEAD!!!!!!			"

												Ok so the game is amazing! However the main attraction of the game is the multiplayer. But it requires setting up the UPnP! Which if you have comcast or a another major provider requires a long phone call resetting your router and if done wrong will corrupt everything. This is not a simple matter, and should have been in the main design phase. There is a lot of issues. I liked how the dev's tried to create a neat game. But they do not have the chain rule where for supporting armies next to each other only applies in hexes not linear lines nor other issues.Players expect way way too much of you if you simply want to play a nice multiplayer game. Most people lock their games so only their friends can play. Now if you don't have friends, are a steam, social rogue like me. (Which is probably the majority) You are left out. EVEN IF YOU CAN get into a game If you play any manuals at all they add you to their troll list. If you are winning decisively because you are better they quit. It's like why even have the multiplayer? Why?  I wanted to be able to play against other humans because they are smarter then the AI, but it's almost not worth it. After awhile the AI gets way too easy and your strategies after about 4-5 games are set in for warlords etc. The game unlike legendary heroes doesn't allow full customization of creating new units and this overall is for simplicity and streamlining of the multiplayer. Unfortunately this makes the game really horrible in that reguard. Now the game overall is amazing. The graphics good, etc. Read other reviews on the graphics. But the fact that this was to be a multiplayer game it fails.			"

												The game looks like hybrid of Civilization and Heroes. The weak point is the battle - it is not intresting at all. After some time I've started to use the autocalculation only. The strategic map level is nice. Heroes, artifacts, leveling, spells are good but all these things lost their sense in battle autocalculation.			"

												Being a fan of the series i´m rather disapointed by that one - though - to be fair - it´s quite good..selling factions that were part of the game as a dlc forces my thumb down - that´s a bad habbit - that this got common is no excuse..there are some improvements - the best of them came with a patch - the possibility to have ""allied neutral"" cities that provide you with some troops or money - without micromanaging them and taking too much concern on their defence..the fights are in some points a step back - because besieged cities have only one side fighting front.. so there is much strategy taken away.. the armies are smaller and the rounds are quite slow - the loading time of a battle is wuite slow.. and i don´t like that nearly dead enemies fight with full strenghth aswell.. though that helps your own nearly dead units..though there are more leveling up stages for the troups than in earlyier games .. what i actually like.. weak troops on highest level still die on one attack of a stronger one .. so the good thinking of higher levels - doesn´t really work out in practice..the weaker units have 10 - middle units 3 - higher 1 - persons shown.. actually i like that change alot.. but though the grafics are improved of course.. the units dont look really good.. it´s like looking at them from very far and so i miss the feeling of playing orcs elves ore whatever..the campaigns are ok - but a chance given away - why not let the player decide to conquer a province on the campaign map - that could have gotten a campaign map - but is just an illustration..so overall - of course a must have of fans of the series - thats why i got it - but they could have done alot better - and actually don´t deserve our money when letting us extra pay for hobbits and frostlings and improvements of the game..besides the prices for the the dlcs.. other people wouldn´t stay polite on this.. greedy lazy work..if you like games like that check out falling enchantres legendary heroes - though there are lots of dlcs aswell.. they are  much cheaper and you don´t need them at all beacause the basic game is so rich of content itself.. (while hobbits in aow actually are essential..) falling enchantres is another dimension of gameplay the lazy aow creators could learn alot from.. "

												Neat but♥♥♥♥♥♥still isnt fixed which among a few things are. City spam is still the way to go, nothing changed there, i spammed a few cities and was stomping the ai. alignment is barely relevant. i wish they fixed it so that when i turn on simultaneous turns i am not waiting forever or clicking 3 times for it to go threw. its as if the system is made for turn after turn, yet they wrenched in the option and it is crap, in the beginning it works around turn 20 it begins slowing down and at turn 30 it becomes unplayable. some races are barely useable at all, and some are just so damn superior that its nearly impossible not to pick em, and since every class has atleast one unit that steals units. and some races are more suceptible to this then others, why even pick em. they did protect the more valuable loot around the map this time around so you can't just summon a scout every turn for the next 9 turns, ((and steal everything so your cities develop quicker then others.)) yet gold and mana and population is still rife for the taking so why not make em. Spells are still overpowered as can be.which is good yet, they tend to be abit tooooo overpowered you can win a battle by spells allone destroying a entire army whimsically because reasons. also the creation of items fun idea poorly implemented as i can make anything and everything. making trades off such items irrelevant as i can get em maybe the next turn. ((the exception being the mounts the sorceror can summon, but you can find em in dungeons aswell,  your gonna be doing those dungeons anyways.))the only thing i liked was the combat but after doing that for a while it gets boring too. since its allot off the same. no real tactics needed other then mmm i need to shove a meaty guy infront off em and get a sneaky guy behind em. all in all i wanted this to be fun, and still want it to be fun. i keep trying keep getting dissapointed.P.S. 40 bucks and 20 bucks per dlc, are you kidding me. thats 80 bucks...

												I wasn't fan of 4X games until played this gem called Age of Wonders. With it's its beautiful world and enchanting music, Age of Wonders offers an experience that only few great 4X's could offer.It is nnot as deep as Civilization games since it is more oriented towards combat than empire expansion, but the fun is always there. You can feel the difference between factions and on top of that they are balanced which is a feat considering the amount of factions there.I strongly recommend this game for fans of 4X's and turn strategy games alike.

												If you are a casual gamer, stay away from this game! I have been playing games my whole life and feel I am decently skilled (I usually play games on moderate difficulty settings), but I consider myself a casual gamer because I play games to kick back, de-stress, and have some fun, not to become even more stressed and frustrated that I was before I sat down. The major flaw with this game is purely that the difficulty settings are horrible. When playing scenarios, the ""Easy"" setting is not easy. After restarting the second scenario on Easy 5 times, I have done my research and it appears to be that only one tactic works to win in certain scenarios, leaving no room for error if that is not how you are used to playing these types of games. I know this is a new game, so I am crossing my fingers that I did not waste my money and that a patch will be released that will make it a bit easier to play.			"

												I was VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH AOW3 Just like I was dissapointed with Diablo3. Mostly dissapointed in this game because they didn't really add anything new to the gameplay experience, it's nearly identical to it's predecessors. Additionally, they eliminated my favorite race to play with (the Ice people from AOW 1 and 2). Once you play the game online once or twice, every race has literally one way you play or you will lose. There is very little strategy in this game, you just get the super monsters and wipe everyone out, they are unbalanced as all hell.			"

												It's not a bad game, it's just that it doesn't do much of anything better than what's already on the market. I will give the game credit for the ability to combine different races and classes. It adds a somewhat decent amount of variety to the game.Also worth noting is that I encountered a bug that would crash the game when I tried to open the research menu. This effectively crippled my ability to make progress. Basically, the bug was a game ender... I did get around it by running the game in debug mode.			"

												I just can not put into words how badly this game plays.  I seriously wish i could return it but since I tend to buy games and then take time to get around to trying them I'm outside of the very short 2 week window, and the tutorial is longer than 2 hours and it takes that long to get a feel for the game.  Sadly it's another bad fantasy turn based strategy game.  There is little to no explaination in the campaign - i wouldn't call it a tutorial even if that word pops up when you start.  It really is a throw you too the wolves style intro.  Thing happen that the game just doesn't explain why it's happening or how to try and stop it.  The game has potential but for anyone new to the genre they are left hanging out to dry and will get slaughtered and have little to no idea as to WHY they were being so easily killed.			"

												Look no further. This is the best turn-based fantasy game so far. I got addicted to Age of Wonders 2 way back, and needing a bit of a graphics overhaul shifted to that fantasy mod in Civ 4, then to Fallen Enchantress, then Warlock. But no other high fantasy game immersed me as much as AOW 3. Its not just the gameplay, its also the UI design. It may seem complicated at first then it becomes second nature - how all important infos are accessible right in front of you, and shifting from surface to underground and back is such a breeze. One of the things that made AOW 2 satisfying before is its combat - and so, soooo much deeper than any Heroes of Might and Magic game. Now, for AOW 3 - everything has been revamped, the graphics are gorgeous colorful yet without being too kiddie, and really requires some deep tactical thinking. You want some intense, strategy combat thats fast, and still deep - this is it. AOW 3 is here to stay :)			"

Posted: June 3, 2016
												I so much want to recommend this game.  The first turn based strategy game I played was Warlords.  And later I became obsessed with Heros of Might and Magic.  Age of Wonders III is like Warlords and Heros mated and had a beautiful new baby.  I loved it at first.  The UI looks good and is pretty intuitive.  It takes a little effort to learn, as there are a ton of different units and abilities,  but that is part of what you are there for in a game like this, no? At first I was overjoyed.  The AI played pretty well and the game felt challenging but fair.  I could tell I was going to sink a lot of playtime into this game.  Then in the middle of a campaign mission (thats about 4 hours in) the AI starts spamming my cities with something called ""Incite Riot"".  So the way this works is that your cities have a HAPPINESS level that determines how hard they work and fight.  Normally my cities mid-game are in the 50-150 range of happiness.  Incite Riot drops the happiness -600 AND if you don't get rid of it in a few turns the city riots, spawning a bunch of enemy rebel units you need to deal with.The way these GLOBAL spells (that you cast on the strategic map, not the tactical) is that they cost an certain amount of mana and if you generate say 70 mana per turn and the spell costs 90 it will take 2 turns before you can cast it.  So you say ""I want to cast this"" in preparation and then a countdown will tick each turn until it is ready.    And these city/empire affecting spells last until the opponent casts a Disjunct to get rid of it.  So say the AI casts Incite this turn.  The spell integrity is at 100%.  I then cast Disjunct this turn.  The game says ""you have a 50% chance of disjunction"".  The formula seems to be (200 - INTEGRITY) / 2 is the chance to Disjunct.  And if you fail the roll the INTEGRITY is cut by half for your next try.  But meanwhile your opponent can REINFORCE an active spell all the way up to 200.  In that case, your chance to Disjunct would be 200-200 = 0, but it never goes below 5% so you always have some chance of Disjunction.And that is exactly what happens.  The AI spams both Incite Riot on a new city and reinforces the ones it has out to 200%  integrity EVERY turn.  And I can only fire off Disjunct (at a 5% chance) every other turn.  Because happiness is so low my empire production grinds to a halt and my units start getting beaten up in every fight.  Plus the rioting sometimes breaks out.  Basically the game becomes chasing to put out fires that keep getting re-lit until the opponent (who's economy is fine) crushes you.  There doesn't seem to be anything you can do to counter or get out from under this once it starts.  I replayed the level 3 times and the same thing happened each time.  So basically the game is too unbalanced for me to recommend.  Hope my explanation is clear and helpful.			"

												As someone who discovered the previous games after playing this one. I can assure you this game is not worth buying. The game by itself is not bad. Decent gameplay, plenty of units, stats and items, nice music... However it just completely lacks the charm of its former titles.The 3d graphics are not an improvement, as Age of Wonders 2 and even the first Age of Wonders look much better and are more appealing. And the map editor is a buggy mess. You'll get crashes and world corruptions all the time.Age of Wonders 2 handled this better and in a more comprehensive way. The dev tools here are not user-friendly and require a beefy computer to handle. As for the character editor. Sure it's nice to have some variation, but it provides too little, and at a high price, since the characters look like something out of World of Warcraft. The previous titles offered a selection of portraits, which though limited, provided quality instead of quantity.The best+Good gameplay+Decent Campaigns+A large amount of spells, items and units+ModdableThe worst-Sacrifice quality for quantity in almost every aspect of the game-Map editor and dev tools feel like an unfinished product-Graphics Again, it's not a bad game and has a lot of unique innovative features, but it's way to expensive for what it offers. Better stick to the classics and enjoy countless hours of fun at a much more affordable price.			"

												I liked AOW 1 a bunch. I liked AOW 2 a bunch. I don't like this one. It doesn't feel like an Age of Wonders game.A lot of the positive comments go on about how it is good if you like Civ, and I think that is true.But I don't think that is what Age of Wonders should be.			"

												Such a disappointment. I have played over 500 hours and every race and class and came to the conclusion that this game is horribly poor in concept, Playability is lackluster at best and... enough said. The problems are:Poor unit balancingPoor Spell balancingAOW Shadow Magic is by FAR superior in concept and design. I had expected that AOW3 would be similar and I couldn't be more wrong. This newer format has serious problems. As a player in a game I wish to enjoy what I am indulged in.....which is playing in a fantasy game. I do not wished to be lectured by the Political Correct Police that my action to invade a town is an evil act and thus get scolded by negative race relation points.  I mean really?? I will give you an example: I am an Elf Druid (good). I fight a neutral city (orcs slighty good alignment) and win. My reward is poorer racial relations with orcs and a drop in my stading to slightly good.Do yourself a favor get AOW Shadow Magic and don't purchase this abomination.			"

												I loved this game.  I love epic single player turn based war games.  But the developers have ruined AoW3 with patches for the single players.  The capitals start far too close, the game has become a 30-50 turn slug fest just like multiplayer.  It basically caters now to multiplayer and all sense of long games has been destroyed.  The map selection aspects are pointless - you can select capitals to be FAR apart and they end up a few turns from each other (this used to be different with them being equally spaced around an extra large map but the devs changed them so they are grouped together and most of the map is empty space.)SO if you are into multiplayer - get this game.  If you are into quick single player - get this game.  If you like epic long games - don't get this game - the devs have ruined it.			"

												I love these games, 4x is my love lolHowever i do not like this one much, i have spent alot of time in it but it just doesnt sit right.For me the worst parts are:The AI just spam city after city, and the game is just a mess of T4 Units.Finally the sound, the world map is where you will spend most of the time, instead of a nice world ambient sound they added one that has anoying sounds in it, ie a sound like someone banging a stone etc, to make it magical like, it just doesnt work and becomes really anoying, yes you can turn it off and play in silence, frustrating.Then there are the horendious sounds for end turn, units moving etc, really loud harsh anoying sounds.The guy that done the sound needs to walk away lolGrab it in a sale, really cheap but not at full price, no way.

												I purchased this based on the hype online, expecting some sort of engrossing strategy experience to draw me in for weeks, months, years. In reality it's just not all that enjoyable. It's not HOMM3, it's not Civ, it's not Total War, it's certainly not King's Bounty, it's less appealing to me than HOMM6. It's a very slow paced, boring game with dull graphics. I've sunk more than 30 hours into it over about two or three days and I've got very little enjoyment back from that. It's possible that with time I'll grow to like it, but it's certainly not what the Internet hype machine is saying about it.If you're looking for something to fill a HOMM/King's Bounty sized hole in your life then this isn't it. Might be worth checking out in a few months if the price has dropped and the game has been improved & rebalanced. "

												I loved this game at first, but it lost interest fast. I wish steam had a better rating system cause I would probably rate this 6/10, it's worth buying if you are fine with a couple hours of multiplayer fun.But however, it is absolute garbage as a multiplayer game, unless you like games that take days or weeks to complete.  Manual combat stops everything in the game, and forces other players to just sit there and watch or wait, you wont be able to do anything else. The devs were asked a lot to fix this and their response was ""There was no tricks they could do to change this without changing the essence of the game itself"", so apparently the essence of their multiplayer is to bore people out of their minds. The games take so long they even have an option to E-mail you when it's your turn.My other mainj issue with this game is difficulty settings. As someone who always plays on hardest mode for a challenge, I love a challenge, but there is a big difference between smarter AI and just giving them a big hammer to smash you with. This game opted the lazy way out and gave them the big hammer. Hard mode? Sure, we will give the computer units that take an entire army to kill, who can jump over castle walls, AOE instakill your entire army, and while we are at it, we will increase their resistances till the point your best units can only take out 5% of their life per turn, and then increase the computers damage to do 200% of your best unit's health in damage per turn. Enjoy.			"

Not to mention that they are selling the old standard classes as high-priced ""DLCs"". In anyway, i think that the devs received much influence from D&D, WOW and CIV and made such things with AoW.

												Big long-time fan here of the Age of Wonder series. Still have them all.AOW1: awesome. runs on my old laptop so when I travel, nice to pull-up and play, map-editor rocked.AOW2: worst of the series, story stucked, mechanics sucked, bugs, glitches, clunky, weak, lame.AOW: Shadow Magic: Best of the series, stand-alone expansion, basically, super-fixed all the problems with AOW2s very well and a total classic. Map Editor rocks the house.AOW3. The New One. With other series pushing ahead with the fantasy/4x-style games, it made sense for Triumph to go back and make a sequel. Immedicate CON: total lack of story, not cutscenes, totally DOA in this department but the gameplay itself more than makes up for this. It's more going towards a ""Civilization"" 4X style of gameplay, like AOW:SM introduced to the series. NO PROBLEM WITH THAT!!!!Sadly gone are the ""Wizard Towers"" and the treasure trove of spells to troll any invaders into your domain.Gladly gone are roaming independent/allied units that take over parts of your domain without any resistence.Gladly gone are the over-powered doman spells that royally pwn any army that accidently enters your demain under peaceful circumstances.Like the prior games, they push the graphics envelope a bit. However, this game does so most unfairly. Let me explain: This game runs like crap on newer systems even. It turns my CPU into a hamster wheel with Hamster-Cyborg 3000 running on it. What the hell. No time to optimize? The graphics are NOT EVEN THAT GREAT, they look about 5 years behind the times AT LEAST and this crap can chug at times. Solution: turn everything down, still looks okay, but so very disappointing. Lazy programming? Who knows.Gameplay, if you liked AOW:SM, the the exception of the loss of wizard towers and a few minor things, you will feel right at home. Improved style of tactical combat mode looks great, it is nice. I hated AOW2 and AOW:SM removed all the blood/minute gore of AOW1. Same crap here, it's homogenized for you and your 5 kids in your nuclear family. I suppose that was to appeal to the kids who like The Hobbit and LOTR because there are art decision that seemed inspired by those movies, in my opinion. A bit too much in fact.On that note, it seems about half of the races in the prior AOW:SM are totally gone.No more nomads, or Archons (they are Undead now) but the ""Undead"" race is fully gone, so are the Shadow and those other guys that like the Shadows guys, no Dark Elves or offshoots, it all feels rather sucky now.I KNOW, probably because at some point they plan to go the DLC route and play those stupid tricks/games with their fanbase. Time will tell, eh? Whether that's the case or not: BRING BACK THE OTHER FAAUKKING RACES PLZ!So overall, it feels like a graphically amplied, but stripped down version of AOW:SM. It makes improvements, here, there, and overall I recommend it. It is a trusted, trial'd, true fantasy strategy game, with 4X elements because you can build new cities and grow them CIV-style. My complaints are not that big in the grand scheme of this game. I wish there was more options, more choices, and the engine was optimized which I think is far given the aging graphics. There is more to like than to not like, and to list what I like would make this 2 pages more. Last note, it's a ""complicated"" game like CIV 4, so don't expect detailed diplomacy AT ALL or too much detail in anything. It is rather simple on many levels but can be very rewarding and dynamic in its own right. "

												It's better than I feared, but it's worse than I hoped.I really hope patchs fix this game.NOT DLC OR EXPANSIONS, because ♥♥♥♥ you for making me pay you to fix your broken game.Yes the environment looks great, fantastic even.Characters are well modeled and well posed.Hair is completely awful.Clothing/armor textures are very blurry and low res.AA is broken.Yes, these are on highest settings.Tactical maps are unbearably small, it takes 2 turns for the enemy to engage your front line. Furthermore, ranged units have abysmally low hard limits on range (about 1 turn of a melee unit), whereas Shadow magic handled range quite well with soft limits via accuracy penalties.There is no longer a height advantage to be gained for ranged units as tactical maps are nearly all perfectly flat, and they can even hit units behind giant boulders at reduced damage, whereas the previous AoW games would've laughed at you for attempting such a thing.You cannot manaually place your own units or even rearrange their positions.6 units MAX, seriously?Most magic is in the form of global passive spells now (which are incredibly easy to research, cast, and dispel). Tactical magic is practically worthless now and all boils down to ""do damage by throwing X"", where X is whatever element your specialize in.MOUNTAINS ARE TRAVERSABLE BY ANYONE. Seriously, who thought this was a good idea? Mountains used to be natural roadblocks, and every faction and their own unique ways of dealing with them; flying units, transport units, tunnelers, terraforming, etc. Now they're just speedbumps.Terrain costs are a joke, harsh terrain is so easy to move on now that roads are hardly neccesary, whereas before they usued to nearly double your range, even on already good terrain, now they merely increase it by 20-30%.Research is much too fast, and much too linear. You used to be able to branch out and pick and choose want you wanted, now you're restricted to linear paths, and even some things are research for the sake of accessing more research.AI becomes incredibly passive on large maps, on every difficulty setting.Independant cities are practically desperate for you to take them over since they hand out quests like candy (completeing the quest gives you their city), now they're no longer bastions of death that are difficult and rewarding to take over.Every faction is homogenized: everyone gets a cavalry counter, everyone gets a handful of ranged units, everyone gets one tanky unit etc. No one has unique mechanics anymore like packing up your cities and moving them, spreading death as your city expands.Cities themselves don't specialize anymore, now every city can be just as good as every other city, since they don't get bonuses from gods and buildings are extremely quick to build. Hoorrraaay everyone gets gold stars for participation :), ♥♥♥♥ specialization am I right guys?			"

												This  game is awesome except for the stupid, ridiculous, annoying, intrusive, and complicated DRM.  The game is great, but Triumph - SCREW YOU for FOPCING me to make an account and log in and deal with passwords and registration hassles to play a game I PAID FOR,  Five stars for the game, negative ten for the DRM.  Therefore I am NOT recommending this game, nor wilI buy anymore games from you.  I have better things to do wwith my time thanspend two hours trying to get registered - even though I am ALREADY registered and my account says ACTIVATED.  Clearly you have not gotten the message that DRM is dead.			"

												I really wish i could give a thumb up for this game, but i just can't. The first couple of days was amazing and i especially loved the music as the old tunes forged together with the new elements and preserved something from the first game's atmosphere. After a good start the game is run out of steam as slowly the weakness are surfacing. Borrowed elements  from the great classic Master of Magic, but not enough just to borrow the good ideas.First i would like to mention of the Heroes. There is miserably lot of ways to develop their skill and on the end they are not worth much more than another stronger units. Except catch the bullet first on the battlefield because if the battle won they newer die.Next is on my list is the fortifications. The purpose of them is to be able to protect a place with a small force against a much bigger, and that will not happen in this game. Maximum garrison is the only effective way to repel attacks, or it supposed to but the enemy is always up to date about my under defended cities and ready for action.You would expect a massive metropolis able to support all the building and an army. It won't.The AI is irrational, sometimes set back and pathetic, other times  too good and to beat it you have to wait until it make a mistake.The map design is not always work out as the creators wanted, and cause difficult situations. This list can go on longer on smaller unrefined thing and bugs during the play. Like why an army have to appear like ragtag on the battlefield and spend turns to set up a proper formation. Or why the spells and tehecs are mixed in the book when i chose the next research and so on...Now i have to say the game is good but not good enough for a veteran who played AoV in the past. If you see it on sale around 10€ you should consider to buy it and it will keep you busy for 3-4 days hopefully. The current 30€ is just too much pain for the fun.			"

												Age of BlundersLike the other reviewers have pointed out, you need to rush to tier 4 units!  The combat is very basic, you never miss, very short ranges and you get  less units then AoE 1 and 2.  I really think the developers were going for a faster MP style game play.  That explains the rush feel, however this is terrible for the single player and does not feel like you have time to explore.   The enemy spawns in  areas that you knew you cleared out and there is no path for  them. If you  leave one of your cities empty it will get taken over without a fight.   Walls are useless now because most units have wall climbing.  This game is frustrating not because it’s hard but because the rush feel and the cheap spawning city attacks.   The graphics are just ok, but some units are hard to see against the background as well as some of the places to visit.  Over all I’m disappointed			"

												I was extremely hyped for this game, 4X Game with turnbased D&D style combat, but it has to be one of the most boring games to ever exist.The depth of its grand stragety is worst than Civ Beyond Earth, completely unengaging. More specifically nothing you do in game has any over arching consequences, units are extremely easy to aqcuire and ""leader"" system is boring.Which is fine, because it is the combat that makes this game unique. Unfortunately that is just as unengaging and seriously lakcing in depth. Skirmishes take unecessarily long, with huge maps that are generally sparsely populated with actual strategic elements. This has to be the one instance I have to disagree with The Cynincal Brit's review. I expected Civ 5 with a more complex combat-focused, instead it just a Heroes of Might and Magic clone that tries to be something bigger than it is.			"

												I've been having serious issues with this game from the moment I bought it. The first few times I played it, it crashed. Then I started getting the 'Installation Invalid' box every time I clicked on Play Game (Remedied by playing in Debug Mode only). Now I have problems with overlapping white boxes replacing icons, backgrounds, 3D avatars and text boxes (Including the options box) and invisible text. It's proven to make my game litterally unplayable. Also, when the new patch (1.9) came out on Wednesday with an apparent fix, my game did not update, and still hasn't. I've been everywhen I can go online and can't find any fixes for this problem.The people who are supposed to be fixing these problems (and from the number of people suffering from them, they're obviously major problems) need to get their finger out and start dealing with this mess, or they'll end up with a lot of customers wanting their money back.

												Game has become exceptionally boring compared to the previous games where all units had a purpose and could still be useful during the late game. After turn 50 all the heroes in AOW3 become useless and the only units to produce are the T4 units which overwhelm all other armies including heroes. Diplomacy made far more sense in the previous games of the series with like minded empires allying with one another. The AI in AOW3, specifically the absolute good, empires will declare war just to conquire the player, if the players armies are weak, which goes against the entire premise of what it means to be good. The graphics in the game are nice but due to the extremely simplistic AI and the focus on making single focused armies the game becomes nothing but an attrition combat game where all the tactics/combat and armies are exactly the same. This game is boring.			"

The stupidity of the people unfortunately has allowed this to thrive to what it is today.  The simple fact that companies release games that are ""incomplete"" just to release a paid addition (that was already complete at the time of release) a few months later, is just sad.

The core game play hasn't changed at all, and many quality of life improvements that they could and should have made still stand unimplemented. The only reason to buy this over shadow magic or age of wonders II would be the story; Save that the story is a cringe worthy heavy-handed social justice issue for a problem that doesn't exist in any developed nation and hasn't for hundreds of years. I have no idea who they are trying to cater to by adding that in. I do not recommend this game. Shadow magic has exactly the same gameplay and a much better story.

												Inevitability of gradualness. Usually, in a few years, you are made stringbean thin or grotesquely deformed, crippled and ugly, or even made over one foot shorter or one foot taller, as the Computer God sees fit. Virtually all of the important instant plastic surgery is done to you inside the Computer God sealed robot operating cabinet. Even unbelievable, impossible plastic surgery operations, all impossible even for dozens of vicious kosher bosher doctors working around the clock for weeks. The Computer God sealed robot operating cabinet can perform all of the above impossible plastic surgery operations overnight, even dwarfting you over a foot, or increasing your height by two feet. This is possible because Computer God robot operating cabinet imitates your microminiature electrical current intelligence system in your body.

												Hello everyone!I've just finished both campaigns in the game where I could use all classess. I have mixed feelings: dissapointment and enjoy. I have to mention that I am a fan of HoMM 3 Universe and never played games like AoW before. So, here are positive moments (in my opinion):- using several armies in the battle at once; - nice differences between races and armies with their own strong and weak points;- good soundtrack;- authentic Universe.Negative moments:- it could be strange, but I didn't understand how to use all armies you want. For ex, I surrond my enemies city, attacking with my 3 armies, but why it is showing that can use only 2 of them. Maybe this is lack of my skill;- on one hand, you have nice variety of units, on the other, you don't have enough time to produce the strongest ones. The tactics is simple in that way, use your default army and try to capture resources around your base, saving before and after every battle, earning promotions for your fighters. Using this tacs you have to destroy your opponent using 1-3 lvl units, because you don't have enough time to develop and produce the strongest. AI will do it much faster. AoW III has it's own unique style, but whenever I played this game I always had a feeling, that it was still raw. There is lot work to do, especially in balance. In this present condition of this game I can't recommend it.			"

They just go through them, and if you declare war when they do so, then you're the one at fault.I thought it would have been better than this.

												Its such a shame. I bought all the originals when they came out years ago.. and this game took all that was good with those and threw it out.  What was left is a almost strategic game that seems to lack the ""Wonder"" in the title. There are so many components to this game that are irrelevant.. theres no reason to terraform, diplomacy is completely useless (I mean really.. he tresspasses in my territory and I can't even ask him to stop?), and the storyline is boring. The potential to succeed was ignored.			"

												Cannot recommend this. It is neither as simple and smart as its predecessors nor is it very elegant.1) The economics/strategy layer is way off balance 2) the single player missions are horrible (by the very first mission you're in control of a thousand cities and all races of the game, and it just gets worse. It's basically the same mission over and over again).3) The combat system we all know and adore is there, But the most fun parts are gone... You can no longer assault a city from several directions. It's just one long battle line now...4) Extremely stupid design decision took all the focus away from the races and now it's ""classes"" instead. So what race you are matters very little. There's hardly any differentiation beyond a few ability scores here and there. It is NOTHING like AOM2 where every race was completely distinct in almost everything.In short, this is not as good as the one before it, so how could I recommend it?			"

												In all Age of Wonders games (I played them all), AI was always weaker then let's say HOMM's. This one is no exception. However, it could still be very addictive, fun empire-building experience, if not for programming issues. For me, game crashes both on Windows and Linux after 5th or 6th battle.So I can not recommend it in a state it is now. I recommend to wait until more patches are released.Upd as of 9.11.2016. After recent patch, game crashes less, and not so predictably. Tested only on Linux. Still annoying as hell, but at least you can play it now - crashes only after 10-20 turns now.			"

I love games like Civilization IV and V, even if I am not too great at them, but this game has no appeal to me. I should of bought Fallen Enchantress instead. Buyer beware. Maybe I am missing something, but I don't understand how this game garnered so many positive ratings and reviews. It is just not fun and everything about it is confusing. At this moment in time, I will never spring for another game from Triumph Games, they let me down miserably.			"

Regarding the game, its not bad , the problem is its not top notch turn-based strategy game and its also not a top notch turn-based rpg, its just ""okay"" at both things .

												So, here is my story:I got the game as soon as it was released. Any multiplayer game - I wasn't interested in singleplayer from the start (never ever played campaign) - ended with the runtime error during battles or crashes between turns.I had decided not to bother developers personally, as I wasn't the only one (Steam forums were full with ""This p2p does not work!""), so I waited, and while I was waiting I had decided to gift this game to my neighbor (man got a grade in chess, so it was a desperate doing).2 months of waiting - same as ever. And 4 months later they've released Golden Realms DLC as their project claimed to be ""total success""...No need to say it's useless to buy just the base game: people with DLC got adidtional skills even for base factions, at least they had when it was released. It's not even close to the competitive play.What about connection? I got some issues when playing through Steam in other games, yes, but not with the man I share the same Inthernet (only 2 exceptions up to the date, AoW is one of them).If you going to buy this game, buy it with DLC's. And ask other people on forums beforehand: how exactly the connection is in your region and even with your provider. No one would play with you if they would know you are crashing the game (sooner or later they would).Otherwise, it's pretty good game.And if you want to ask about my 37 hours, here is the answer: like 16 hours were spent on training (it's not very polite not to know the basics), 10 hours on afk (it's pretty slugish to play alone), the rest goes for crashes, accusations of how noob I am (some people think you are ctrl+shift+esc the game, even if a battle was won by you, morons), unfruitfull reconnections. Not the best proportions.			"

												To me, this game is completely lame. Seeing the graphics, I felt as if I fell back through time into 2000 (or earlier). Awful. Seeing the gameplay, and lots of the ""story"" texts accompanying the units - well, in most games, it brings some level of immersion (if not useful information), here, it is just excessive ""information"" garbage. Completely unrelated to anything ingame, just some ""random xy character"" telling some ""story"" (could even be my aunt...)As for the customisation of the avatar - 3 clothes? Really? (Checking the year again) Looks of all the races - am I the only one who thinks they all look like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Really?Tech trees - with no invention whatsoever. That's where I felt disappointed most. Actually, no... I got disappointed everywhere in this game...Ingame information - it is there, but you can access it only AFTER you start the game. Why cant you see what type of terrain Goblins like/dislike before picking them, for example? Or anything else, for that instance? Why don't I see what skills will picking air or fire or anything bring me? Besides of most of the skills being absolutely useless, or all of them being absolutely useless for certain types of characters? Why do I have to learn about this after I start playing? Also NO MANUAL?!?! Like, at all?!Anyway. Comparing this ""sequel"" to the AoW II - it fails completely. I am really sorry I bought this game. Played it for a week, gotten bored immensely, not only by the really ""pulp fiction"" story, but by the scenarios, by the random maps even! Awful!If I could get my money back, I would, trust me. Blerg. Way overpriced, should have gone right to Good Old Games, only it would be Lame Old Games.0% fun "

												*Sigh* where to begin... The game is garbage in every sense of the word, there is so much wrong with it I can't list every thing all at once but I can list some of the major issues.Difficulty is a joke, the lowest difficulty is full of♥♥♥♥♥♥and if you don't out tempo it ( IE don't play Necro) it will steam roll you.  How you say? well timmy let me tell you.  The AI gets so much extra bs it is unfair even at Squire (lowest) setting, it expands very fast and the AI cheats to get damn near every extra attack (you can get up two 3) AND is damn near immune to every form of debuff (ie I cast dispel several times and it resisted).  The units are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥as well, I took two forces max of 6 with a mox of tier 1,2 and 3 against a unit with 6 (it had two heros and some tier 1 and 2 units) and I walked away with only 4 people my main hero included which to me is bs.  Water combat is very flawed and you can and will be crushed if you come to the fight unprepared, NO♥♥♥♥♥♥I hear you say well when you have archers, some good tier 3 units and powerful spells yet still unable to take one whole force of like 6 guys vs your 8 then there is a major issue.  Counter attacks suck nuts in this game due to wimpy units being beast sometimes when counter attacking and I feel that is beyond wrong.  I can't tell if the roaming units of mercs basically target the enemy AI but so far I have not seen it and imho if they do not then that is also a major flaw and you are hindered entirely to much to have them on, unlike Civ V where the barbs bug the living hell out of every one else.  The is a lot more I wanted to put here and I will add it as I remember or encounter it but over all for a 4X type of TBS I would not recommend this to any one, the DLC that adds Necro and Tigeran or w/e is kinda cool but the base game is to crap to make it worth the 20 bucks.

												So this is a civ like based mainly on combat. Which doesn't work cuz every unit takes 4 turns to create. It's just plain boring. Either you make a fast paced tactical game focused on combat, or you do a slower game based on diplomacy, ressources and some combat. There's a ""combat"" mode where you can move your units and make them fight and it sucks. The diplomacy also sucks.I wish steam refund existed when I bought this game.If you want a combat-tactique game get a Fire Emblem, if you want a strategic turn based game with ressources and diplomaty then buy civ but please, for your own sake, don't get Age of Wonder.

												The basic problem with this game is the lack of balance for roaming / random forces.  The game starts with those units in camps around the map.  But even on easy level, these camps / bands will quickly grow in strength, often faster than you can grow.  And the AI of the other empries is to stupid to try and do anything about the camps.  What that eventually leads to is you slowly defeating some AI empire, and then out of nowhere a large random high level monster group comes rumbling, stumbling in to crush you.  Amazing how they did nothing to the AI player but only attack once you control the city and area.  But I guess if they did attack the AI they would wipe them out -or- the AI would wipe them out leaving no roaming bands later in the game.  And this is all on the easiest of levels.  When you try higher levels, these camps quickly start pumping out forces you can-not-defeat.  All in all a very frustrating game.			"

												Must be a lot of fanboys that write reviews for this game because it is downright awful.  Terrible pace..walls do not protect you...horrible game mechanics.  Should not have the Age of Wonders name because it is NOTHING like the other games.  This game is simply not fun.  Save your money.			"

												Well what we have here is yet another sequel to a venerated serie in TBS genre that falls flat on it's face. I'm starting to think that the whole genre is dying off, with the few games that manage to come out, all being subpar experiences. Only the most fanatical TBS players would enjoy this glass of wheat flavored water. Game introduces you to host of different races that all function almost identically to one another, nice reminder when back in the day games could pull off just reskinning same units and calling them with different names. Combat being the only thing differentiating this from all the other run off the mill TBS games, but you'll be autocombatting in no time just to save you from the tedious exercise in futility of spending any more time playing this bland game.The game is boring, it feels like it was made by small indiestudio and finishing a game leaves you with bitter taste regret. You'll wind up wondering when did your life become so♥♥♥♥♥♥that you'll willingly waste hours on end trying to find out what happens in the story that appears to have been added in as afterthought.Even taxidermist couldn't capture the cold dead eyes of this game. Game that stands as a tombstone to once great and thriving genre of classics. If you wan't better use for your 30 euros, take them out as 10cnt coins and dump them in middle of intersection near some elementary school and watch the ensuing chaos.			"

												The absolutely most generic fantasy turnbased strategy similar to the Heroes series that was ever created. If for some reason you can't get enough of those(Even though the Heroes games provide more then enough of playtime for several lifetimes) then this is the game for you. But i'm done with it after 3 hours.			"

												Seems decent at first. Sort of a might and magic heros ripe-off. But before even finished the first game I could see the game  imbalances, the poor design, the poor imagination, and worst of all the poor excuse for ""tactics"". Save yourself some time and money and just load up your favorite might and magic again.			"

												After playing it long enough to see a city fully upgraded and pull out all the new troops; it goes by fast if you know how to build up right off the bat. I can say this is a great standalone revamp of the game, but I wouldn't recomend it for full price, unless your really acking for a fast paced turn based that thinks its an RTS made by blizard.The class system isn't bad, but minus the new graphics it could have easily been a cheap standalone expansion for the old ones. If you use the same tactics you did in the past games this will be rather easy to play, with a few momments of 'look at that"" when you see one of the class system units fight the first time, then it will be just another unit to use, some of wich will have vets going ""didn't that use to be part of some other race?""Its ok novelty experince, but at its core its easier to play, wich is a plus I guess, but I didn't expect it to get more simple considering the first one came out when I was freshman in high school, and picked it up rather fast for a first time turn based strat.
