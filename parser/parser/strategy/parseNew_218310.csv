												Frontline Tactics kept me entertained for more than 20 hours and I didn't even pay a cent. The single-player is not bad, but I never played multiplayer because I think it might have some pay-to-win aspects.			"

												this game doesn´t deserve the term ""tactics"" in its name because all in all it´s just a boring, repetitive and monotonous grind on the same small maps (some are even tiny!) over and over again. it´s F2P but don´t waste your precious time grinding this game, it´s not worth it. if you want to play an entertaining and challenging round based tactics-game, go and spend 5 bucks on xcom enemy unknown if it´s on sale.

												This started off as a pretty solid Free-to-Play game!Pros:-Simple gameplay.-No special tricks with the interface. Point to the one of the two actions that you want to do (move, shoot), confirm, execute.-Simple damage and cover mechanics.Cons:-The more you upgrade, the more you die.-Want any ""meaningful"" upgrades? It's no longer a ""Free-to-Play""-String of repetitive campaign maps with no real story or purpose linking them together.Description of my experience:Loaded up my two-man team, killed a few enemy, got some upgrades, and ""proceeded to die in a loud, groutesque, military manner"" (name that movie).For just about every worthwhile upgrade, you'll pay actual money. This isn't like most F2P games where if you're willing, you'll have to grind about ten times as long to earn upgrades. Nope, that option isn't even available.The other thing that is pretty irksome is the fact that you will NEVER outgun your enemy. I upgraded my free chap with a rifle. So did the enemy, and he brought two friends.I upgraded my second free chap with a machine gun... yep, you guessed it! The enemy upgraded too, and brought more of his friends! By the way, the extra kit that your guys carry it slows them down, but it does not slow down the enemy. The more you upgrade, the more you'll die.It's a shame. I think I would have gotten a few more hours out of this one.			"

												I played this game quite a bit on the iPad. Tried it on the PC, thinking I could link my game to both devices. That never worked for me and playing 2 separate games felt like a waste. I enjoyed the game a bit until I realised how pointless upgrading is. If you get a better pistol, the enemy gets the same one. If you buy a sniper, the enemy gets a sniper. Buy a med kit, meet a med kit. What's the point, then? Most missions are easiest with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ starter gear, since the AI seem to utilize then less effectively. In the end I just didn't bother.

												ummm, what's there to say about this... WELL! It WOULD be a relativly fun game untill you look at the upgrades 'n stuff. It's asking you for REAL money to buy an IN GAME character, I forget how much but that's besides the point, GUNS just ONE MEASLY GUN COSTS SOOOOO MUCH, it's not even funny. There is just SO MANY PAYWALLS!!! I can NOT beat another mission BECAUSE I'm at 2 soldiers and their equiped with lame UZIs. IF there weren't SO MANY DAMN PAYWALLS, it would be an actually pretty enjoyable game, grphics arent that good and people shoot through cover but they can patch that... hopefully, maybe t's changed now because I uninstalled this game 2 weeks ago, I don't want to know, but with paywalls 2/10 for me, WITHOUT paywalls 6/10			"

												A rather simple but very fun turn based stratagy game. Problem is that balence is extreamly off.For example, a common low defense mission that only lets you bring in two people... Defense with only two people. REALLY!? How is that even fair!? This is a joke really and there is no way to win against the hordes of respawning enemies. The game dosen't even give you a chance to get better. I suported it with 20 dollers, getting me three soldiers and extra credits and it still don't help me win...at all...There's an achivment for spending 100$s on the game in a spesific area. -_-Aperently having a sniper rifle makes you super slow. (When did this happen?)Overall I do not suggest this game to anyone. It's just a money grab.			"

												I could not decide whether I would recommend this game or not. Frontline Tactics has some gameplay that is debatably fun but it also has some horrible cash shop elements to it that I cant ignore. If the game was any worse I wouldn't be able to recommend it but at this point all I can say is you should try it, it has some pretty big pros and cons. The game play can be fun but then the missions can be boring, customizing youre soldiers is fun but hitting a pay wall is awefull. The game just gives and takes like that.			"

												Man! The people who made this game should go out of buisness!Oh they did? Oh dear, this is akward.Well actually I don't mean that, really, I would never wish people out of a job but how odd that Full Control is 'shutting up shop' because their library of games are at worst 'mediocre' and at best well, above average.While nothing in their library really stood out and grabbed me they were always playable, mostly bug free and as a company they were one of the first to notice me and take my feedback on-board, making patches fairly quickly.

I wouldn't say I have a soft spot for them but I don't dislike them by any means, how could I? There are so many terrible games with some companies spitting them out like a turd machinegun and yet they never seem to go out of buisness! Still, you are not here to read about Full-Control, you are here to read about this game so lets talk about the game or rather what can I talk about? I summed it up already. The game is above average.The music, sound effects and graphics are all pretty fine.The gameplay? a turn based squad based shooter. Terrorists be stylin' and we be hatin' so go kill them all and show them whos boss.Even now I am struggling to find things to complain about because its as basic an execution as you can get really.I had fun with the game and I beat the whole compaign without ever spending a dime. That's right as far as free to play goes this game is 100% free with none of the stupid grind these type of games have.It also has multiplayer too and with it being a turn based game you dont have to play in real time for the MP to work, although it seems like their is no real time version at present and given the uncertainty of FC's future it is unlikely there ever will be.Overall the game is free so feel free (ho ho!) to try it out and if it isn't for you then so be it.I also created a wiki for this game back when it launched, which is 100% complete now.http://frontline-tactics.wikia.com/wiki/Frontline_Tactics_WikiJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												The game goes on to be fun for a few hours, but once you think you're good at it, the game becomes unrealistic & unbeatable in all conditions. The only way to beat it being to spend real money. Because even at 'Low' Level the game becomes agame of Zerg Rush, while if you're not a wallet warrior, your three soldiers can do nothing  due to glitches causing enemies to get two turns, move longer distances, & do modded damage. The graphics are decent for the type of game it is, but there are way too many bugs, in fact. I'd call this game an absoloute Alpha. It's a game to pass time for an hour or so, then uninstall due to unbeatable odds.			"

												This is my first review using the new system. I decided to do this neat little game called Frontline: Tactics. I played this during the summer due to boredom thinking ""Hey, this game looks cool."" After some thought, I downloaded it. I played it for about 15 minutes and thought it was pretty fun. I progressed to the difficulty of 'Easy' above 'Very Easy.'It honestly felt like ""Very Hard.'I quickly realized that one of the many reasons why it got harder was because it was a free-to-play game. The enemies are using one shot kills and unfair shots; prompting you to go ""I need to get an upgrade. These basic weapons aren't going to cut it."" Unfortunately, these upgrades cost REAL money. (But is that much of a surprise?) I prefer not to spend money on a F2P game. This is not a 'Free to Win' game where you can use any weapons at your dispose and try to win. This is a 'Pay 2 Win' game. I'm sorry but this is my honest opinion. Good day! "

												Frontline Tactics is a free to play turn-base combat game.  It worked on Win 10, sounded ok, played ok, looked ok.  It plays like X-Com, including the infamous difficulty.  CONS:- there is no ""Fog of War"" indicators.- It was ported from the Ipad.- When you upgrade your soldiers, all the enemy you meet afterward wil be upgraded too.- Some game modes are completely unbalanced, unwinable.- The developer is a failing business, under financial troubles.- Terrible amount of grind.- Many of the missions are actually the same or similliar in every way. -- The game cheats in everyway possible to make it too hard to make you spend real money on upgrades.- The store and multiplayer mode is turned off.You can try this game but i DON'T suggest paying real money into this game.

												This is a game that really suprised me, I watched videos and screenshots of it and it was OK. I downloaded it out of a joke but it turns out it is a lot of fun.INTRO: You start with Easy difficulty on the missions and while you proceed, your difficulty gets more and more higher. There is a lot of missions but you need to get them. BARRACKS: Option taht makes you customize your soldiers using your credits earned by completing missions. You can change your soldier's name, buy a new gun or add attachments, give skills, change profiency, give armor, give grenade and see his statistics. You don't get much money when you complete a mission but that makes you safe money round by round which is a good thing.MULTIPLAYER: I tried playing with my friend and I have to admit multiplayer is t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e, you shouldn't not try it, it is like the worst thing there is in the history of video gaming, the lag is incredible, you shall not try the mutliplayer. BUGS: There are a lot of bugs in the game but it does not change my opinion about it. Some bugs are like gun through the cover, shooting through trucks and similar.

												This game is very realistic! By this I mean that you can shoot through just about anything. This includes walls, corners, rocks, concrete, and layers of boxes. Besides this the hard missions are almost impossible. Every time I win a hard mission I fell like I should write a letter to the developers saying how I beat the game!! Another set back for hard missions is by the time you get to them you have three people and the enemy has ten. So in other words play this game for about two to three hours and then stop or else you will hate it.			"

												This is basically a strategy game like Xcom or some other grid-based strategy game so there isn't a lot to talk about Frontline Tactics. From what I have seen after playing 40+ hours, there are a few things here and there that makes me scratch my head and think, ""are you being serious here?"" The first thing is the business model consists of buying camos for your soldiers and additional soldiers along with extra credits to burn through, but I have never spent a single cent on this game because you can get everything you need after playing for a while so I never saw the point into buying anything from the store in the first place. Most of the time I can beat the AI just fine, but there are a few occasions that made me feel like the AI is cheating a bit with enemies who moves before you and they always outnumber you equipped with every piece of equipment you have bought. Once you've unlocked everything you wanted, there really isn't a whole lot to do left so most likely you're pretty much done playing Frontline Tactics. It's a nice little game to kill some time if you're bored, but that would be better suited for mobile devices than on PC because there are so many other games that is worth your time over Frontline Tactics. I still don't know whether to give Frontline Tactics a thumbs up or a thumbs down because I actually had a decent amount of fun with this game, but at the same time I already said to myself ""I'm done with this game because there's nothing to do now"" so I will give this game a thumbs up because the game is still worth trying out to see if you even like these types of strategy games, but I think the appeal won't last very long for some people.

												Respectfully, I don't see how anyone can say this is a perfect example of a Free to Play game, in fact, it's actually the worst. This game has an awful Pay to Win aspect and an unplayable Singleplayer with dead multiplayer servers, that makes this game one bug waste of Hard Drive space This is one of the worst Free to Play games I ever played...Overall: 3- Fails to achieve anything, and pisses off FTP Player while they're at it...+ The game plays with great potential of becoming a rival to the Frozen Synapse game- This game is not only pay to win, but pay to ENJOY- Dead servers- Horrid SingleplayerGraphics: 6I understand where the graphics are getting at, it's a free game, and it's birds eye view, even though it looks like a mobile game port, I never really had expectations for the graphics in the first place.Gameplay: 3It feels like a dumbed down Frozen Synapse, but that's okay, but once you play you'll realize how cheap it really is, and how unrealistic and foolish players can be and STILL win. Speaking of horrible players, have I mentioned the singleplayer? An abysmal singleplayer is what you would expect from a mainly multiplayer game, but see, they effed it up REAL bad! The A.I. either A. bum-rush you, or B. DON'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL. It basically relies on luck, whether or not the enimies will be cheap no matter how strategic you are, or they will be dumb no matter how much you're winning. You never feel like you get a rewarding experience from it at all.Oh, and one more thing, the Pay to Win is beyond some of the worst I've seen, in-game credits are worthless, and only worth something if you have 5$ along side it, if you don't want to pay, GOOD LUCK, you'll be stuff with a guy with a pistol and a guy with a MACHINE PISTOL while everyone has 5 guys with riot shields and f*cking Snipers. It's frustrating, beyond that it's ABYSMAL!Uniqueness: 6We've seen it before, XCOM, Frozen Synapse, etc. But what stands out about the game is that it actually some what succeeds in making that content stand out, but fails just as you jump right into Singleplayer, and as you fail to decide to spend money, it's just a dumbed down Frozen Synapse with nothing to offer.Music: 5There isn't much music, but there is a background theme in the menu that sadly repeats are has no variation, also the in-game sounds are also, but barely qualitfies as music, but just noise.Story: 2There is, technically a warfare story in the game, but it's told in text and is barely established, nonexistant...

												For those who dont want to god mode. It is not easy but the game is not hard. You can't run and gun, you can't zerg, you have to 'take your time' with each mission, not like 30 min. I complete a very low threat mission in 5-8 minutes, and walk away with at least 30k, from a mission that has a base pay of 18k-21kThis game is simple and easy to use. point and click for movement, for attacks, and use of Skills like smoke bombs. The combat is like many other tactics games, which is I assume, why you went seraching for a tactics games. You deploy your troops, outmaneuver your opponent, have better positioning and over come the odds.Some of the people reviewing this game seem to be upset about the ""paywall"". I had almost everything unlocked, with out ever spending a dime. Will I spend some money later? Most likely, I like the camo outfits I can get. But I wont be paying for unit upgrades. You can get upgrades from in-game credit. The enemys will not use anything you dont have. If you dont have access to stealth units, the enemy team will not have one. IF you have access to Snipers, then so will the enemy team even if you dont deploy a sniper. So you have plenty of time to accumalate a lot of money and then deck out a new trooper with a new class,  new guns, armor, and skills. The balance I fill is well done, It is a tactics game, you have to out think the mission.Keep your guys alive, you get money for doing so, Get crossfires, you get money for doing do. outside the base payment for missions, you can really rack up some cash with crossfires. I can get 30k-40k off a mission that was only going to pay out 20k. SKILLS, Skills, Skills, SKILLS Pay attention to skills.It will take about 4-5 missions to get a new peice of gear, or skill.After every 5 mission wins you get an unlock you get to choose from new mssion types, an extra trooper or lots of cash, and even new skills.biggest issue, I got a new computer, and when I reloaded Frontline, I had nothing unlocked. It is a big issue, Steam has cloud save, Frontline should be able to incorperate.Not so big of an issue, It does take time to gather the reasources to deck out a new trooper. But not so much that I did nto have fun doing so. The time it takes does give you time to learn the new class you just acquired.  Also, The lets go kill brown guys who all have brown guy names, cliche and over used. "

												The game is ok for the first hours, but it gets quickly repetitive and tedious.  For people who complain that it is too difficult, it isn't.  It requires thinking and it is somewhat challenging.  But if you charge in like rambo, you will find out that your mercenaries' skin is not bullet-proof.  Overall, I don't recommend the game, since you need to pay to skip the grinding... just to realize that updating your soldiers' equipment isn't a big advantage, but rather a disadvantage (the enemy gets the same equipment as you do).

												82 hours in this game. Biggest gripes:Maps are way too small and too few in number.Price scaling makes it damn near impossible to get top level gear without paying.Here is the big one... lack of developer interest in community requests. In 2012 massive numbers of people were playing... and they did nothing to grow content or improve the game for 4 years. Sorry meridian, you missed your window.			"

												This game is, in principle, similar to the 3DS Ghost Recon game - and I liked that game, it was fun for a few hours and had a nice hot seat style multiplayer. As such, you will like or hate this game based on the same reasons you liked or hated the Ghost recon game, but if you played that game then I recommend this becasue it has a similar playstyle and can be fun for a few hours. It's not perfect, but so far I'm having fun.I will say that the singleplayer is pretty nice, it's not too in your face with popups about buying credits or whatever and it is pretty challenging. It is also possible to get through it without spending any real money. In my opinion it is one of the best free to play models I've seen. Most of the upgrades are cosmetics camofloage etc, you can buy classes but you can unlock them through gameplay, they seem to cost a lot of credits at first but each level awards 20'000+ depending on how well you did so you will soon have the classes you want.All in all I will have to recommend it for the singleplayer alone, it's not perfect but hey, its free and its keeping me entertained for now I haven't spent any real money and I don't think I will be pushed too hard to pay money. I have played the multiplayer with friends and it was fun but I wouldn't recommend playing online with people you don't know until you have good loadouts on your characters because it can be a little unforgiving in that respect. Just play it, you're not losing anything by downloading a free game from Steam.			"

												7/10 it's a great game, but sort of for more Advanced or Experienced  Strategy players as it can be hard at first, as once the first mission had me replaying it once and it kind off urges you to buy credits, do simply just upgrade soldiers or get new units. Besides this overall it's a great casual game to aply that you can enjoy.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but it is rather pathetic.The only way to increase your squad size is to pay real money.  No exceptions.The upgrades for your characters cost more than I think is reasonable, perhaps to encrouage players to buy game cash with real money?There is free to play and then there is obvious cash grabs like this.  Again, pathetic.With that out of the way, there really isn't room for ""tactics"" in this game.  You move forward cautiously, hoping to aggro only one enemy at a time and overwhelm it, then repeat until all enemies are gone.  ...unless you want to buy more units with real money, then you would actually have tactical options.The maps are too small to flank enemies.  Any player or enemy unit can cover the width of the map and shoot in one turn.  This makes game concepts like sight and camoflouge pointless.I had hoped this would be a fun little time waster that I could pick up whenever I had a few extra minutes to kill, but it only served to annoy me.  I have gladly supported free to play games with purchases after playing for a while, but I will not be supporting this.  Uninstalling.			"

Kill All Muslims: Melee is a highly realistic towelhead eradication simulator in which your grind-to-glory soldiers march out in full phone game glory to do one move and one action per turn, all in the name of a quest to kill a number of randomly generated Afghani-looking dudes with randomly generated Islamic names.From the resulting moolah, you buy bigger guns or the ability to dual-class. Or, like any sane citizen, you just spend your real-world moolah to unlock it all from the get-go... right?In the developers' own jolly words, yet another game where You can save time by paying.

												Easily one of my favourite games. I haven't played it loads but then again, I don't ever have time. Needless to say that whenever I have a spare moment then on goes this game and up goes my happiness levels. The AI is very well thought out with the occasional moment of derpiness but overall it is great. The guns on this game are phenominal and the upgrades are incredibly well thought out, always making you think 'oooh I must save for that' or 'Would that help me?' Money can be tight but when you get an upgrade it is always noticeable. The In-Game purchases aren't forced upon you and you really don't need them. The entire thing is just a brilliantly well thought out chess like experience that I would've happily paid about £3 for if it was a pay game. Love it to bits! 9.8/10 (I never give out tens)			"

												This game has some very neet tactical elements to it, with very nice quick games. However this game has many flaws. For example, it looks horrible visually and the camera can be extremly buggy at times. Furthermore, this game has an almost pay-to-win aspect to it, that can only be contradicted with hours of grinding for credits and unlockables, in multiple identical maps. Overall this game I would say is fine for a game to casually play, however their are thousands of better free games you can enjoy playing. Rating: 28%/100%.			"

												Alright, let me start out by saying that playing this game without buying a thing is incredibly difficult. If you like challenges, go for it. Otherwise, all DLC is on sale for 2 dollars.Secondly, I bought the DLC pack, and the game became something that wasn't glamarous, but still somehow fun. It's like an old flash game I use to play, but on a bigger scale.The AI isn't horrible, but definitely needs some big improvement. Also you can shoot through things that shouldn't be shot through, so take that into account.One thing people should note is that you can upgrade weapons by only doing a few missions worth of credits. It really does make a big difference when playing this game.Ultimately, I'd say play it, especially if you have a dollar or two to blow from all your steam trading card money. It's a meesly download of about 200mb, and I am having an alright time playing it. Definitely has some potential later on.			"

												he game itself is easy to pick up and put down, and there's enough single-player campaigns to go through. (As of now, I haven't tried the multiplayer- I'll update once I have.)Some more maps would be a nice touch- a desert background does get old after a while, especially if you live in one. But that's just a small complaint that doesn't really hurt the game.The only big problem is the shops. In-game proficiencies and weapons are pretty expensive (three SP campaigns to buy one gun!? Get outta town!) If you want/need a third soldier to work with, you have to pay both real cash and credits. Sss- no bueno, no bueno. >_<Besides the shops, this game isn't too bad. It's worth a try- worst case, at least it was free.			"

												While Free-To-Play, this game is very sub-standard, no where near an XCOM or other TTT.I have many complaints about this game:1. Tutorial in this game is completely useless, especially when it teaches you the crossfire mechanic - there is no indicator to actually show where a unit is vulnerable.2. Graphics despite being on 1080p, are still ugly as they are on even 480p - would be better as a flash game.3. Character movement and shooting sometimes is unresponsive at times.4. Shooting after movement DOES NOT display arc of fire a character has.5. Character skills are completely absent, even specialist classes don't have any special abilities - profiency trees can actually be detrimental to your character!6. This game ACTUALLY encourages you to spend money to get an achievement and to buy credits - it's Pay-To-Win model and the price isn't worth it. Easier to grind. Eg. $100 for 64mil credits!7. You can shoot through walls.There is alot of room for improvement.			"

I like how it is hard to master, but once you master it it is amazing.The only thing i dont like is the small maps, I would prefer if there were larger scale maps earlier on. I also find gaining money quite hard.But overall this is a amazing strategy game with a twist.I enjoy the idea of starting with only 2 units and slowly getting more, I just wish there was a guide in game to tell you what Unit type to buy that would help you most E.g I purchased a Heavy gunner at the start and I just found him constanly dying and i thought that maybe a snipe ming help. But i didn't know.~Final thoughts~The game is amazing but it has its tiny tiny flaws. It is still a amazing free title that i think should be on the top of any stratgy gamers list.~4.5 / 5~			"

I must not be very good because I have hit the point where I can no longer finish any levels.  I have four characters and 2 have a secondary class.  I have not put any money into this game either.  I would recommend this game to anyone but the harder levels are nearly impossible and I cannot get into any multiplayer matches.  The game should have a way to replay the easier levels so you do not just stop progressing and no longer get credits.  However if you want a few hours of fun go ahead and try it.  Maybe you can get farther than I did.			"

												Excellent game for Tabletop Wargamers wanting something a little different.Quick to learn, with moderate difficulty to get into a groove of upgrading and fighting.Could do with an option for battlefields, Seeing middle eastern locations is nice the first few rounds, but soon becomes repeatative.Could do with improved death animations, and character model to scenary interaction could also do with improvement.Just my opinion. Don't let it put you off from trying it.			"

												It's a good game all-in-all, but since the unit turns are random, unless you have 5+ units, you're not moving much unless you get lucky, and plan to lose a unit or two before you can move them into cover.Other then the random turns, the graphics are good, maps are fairly sized, and weapons are balanced.

												Frontline Tactics is a free-to-play squad level, turn-based tactical game where missions become available on a strategic regional map and missions take place on an isometric map based on one of several static locations (Fishing village, tank battle, etc).The basic aim of the game is to complete missions on the game map with the soldiers you have available and the skills and weapons at their disposal.  As you complete more missions you earn credits which can be spent upgrade your team.  For every 5th mission completed, you get to unlock certain strategic options, such as more mission types (Liberate area, Defend area, Timed survival etc), more locations (maps) plus bonuses such as +credits or +team member slots.Its basically a pay-to-pay game, with anything from squad members, solder proficiencies, soldier skills, equipment, weapons, weapon attachments being able to be purchased with in-game credits.  However you do not have to pay, credits can be earned while just playing through missions, which is what I have done.  Its slower, alot slower but, it just means you will have to play alot more missions to get you squad up to spec.I have mixed feelings about about this game.  On one hand the gameplay is fiendishly addictive but, on the other hand it can be enormously frustrating to play.  Luckily its quite forgiving if you get your squad killed or fail a mission as all soldiers have infinite lives and you can replay missions when you lose.What it does do really well is provide a great representation of squad scale tactical battles which are fun and furious and include: use of cover, crossfire, close and ranged combat, thrown explosives, use of camoflague, decent mission variety, overwatch, soldier perks & skills and a decent range of equipment and weapons.What it doesnt do so well is that it isnt balanced on two levels.  It doesnt provide a fair challenge as in alot of missions you will be outnumbered, the enemy will move first in droves and sometimes they will move twice before you even do so and kill several of your men before they have even had a chance to move.  Secondly the rate at which you can upgrade is quite slow depending on your strategy.  However once you do put in a few hours and have completed around 40 missions you will have earned enough credits to have a decent team with dual proficiencies (rifles, smgs, close-combat, hand-to-hand, sniper or heavy weapons) with some armour, some may have grenades (stun, frags) even if your team will have basic skills (one for each proficiency) and basic weapons (which can be upgraded from late 80s to future-tech).  At this stage the game gets to be very enjoyable as even if your enemy gets the jump on you, you should be able to recover and lead your team to victory in most cases.While I havent purchased any in-game credits I did buy the extra soldier dlcs when on sale, and they were more than worth it as you only start your team with 2 solders.  Overall the game is just about recommendable as it is more enjoyable than frustrating and worth the time of anyone who loved Jagged Alliance 2 or any game of that genre.  ** Just be warned that if you are after 100% achievements there is one were you must buy £80/$100/100euros worth of credits just to unlock.  ^^ **			"

												Frontline Tactics is one of the better strategy games for sure. The game features a turn based combat system in which you control up to six squad members at a time. It has the common theme more of them than there are of you. The game allows you to costomize the name and class of yoour soldiers . WARNING: As far as I have been able to figure out, once you choose a weapon for your character you are stuck with that weapon. With that said, all weapons are usefull and effective if used properly. The game also has a multyplayer feature. As far as strategy games go, 8/10			"

												Alright, I don't usually give reviews on games, but I felt the need to on this one. AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS. This was the biggest waste of time I ever played. The ""tactical"" aspects of Frontline Tactics are barely there with most enemies standing devoid of cover, making it child's play to take them out. Granted, your own forces face the same problems, and when there is cover, missions can drag on as you do minimal damage to each other.Ontop of that, the F2P aspect makes you game horribly limited. Mission after Mission is required just to afford even the most mundane of equipment or even more soldiers, and special options like camo or unit customization are strictly Pay Only.Betweem simple AI, simplistic graphics, and very limited customization options from the get go, I would not recommend this to play at all. There are much better Tactics based games out there, either free or cheap enough to buy.			"

												Horrible game,-single player-the enamy outnumbers you by so much that any form of tactics is void.make one bad choice in the beginning in either what you unlock or how you build your squad and you are stuck for ever.you cant build your own game, the game decides what 4 maps you can choose at what setting, so the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mission over an over again cause you dont get new missions if you dont win, and you cant win survival with only 3 man(no medic) so i am stuck with the choice of 4 different survival missions.at some point i thought might be better if i reset my profile, maybe getting rid of the survival missions, now i only have 2 soldiers with no gear but the same ♥♥♥♥ing missions i couldnt do we 3 geared soldiers.-multiplayer-its no live action, actions only happen as soon its your turn again: meaning, i send soldiers, now my friend gets to give his orders and then the enamy again and 20 actions later its my turn again. but not right away cause now i have to watch the last 20 steps in a row instead of just showing every turn when it happens, basicly wait 20 minutes between each turn.the only upside on this game is that its free, otherwise i would be among the biggest wastes of money ever, next to grotesque tactics(which ironicly is from the same publisher) "

												Game had a little potencial, what I like the most is that there's no randomness in the game. Your weapons do damage base on the range short, medium or long rang. The basic damage is then reduce by other factor like cover and armor.The control of the game and it mechanic is fairly easy to learn. But I found the camera control awkward and I didn't find the option to change them. If I would've been a lefty I would have found them just find.The big downfall of the game for me was that for some obscure reason, I could not buy or upgrade anything. All I was getting is a screen saying ""Loading..."". So I was stuck with the two starting guys and their low grade weapons. In PvE mode the missions get harder and harder. At some point it's simply imporssible to complete a mission without upgrading your gear and getting more men. There's no way I'm going to try PvP with 2 guys and the starting gear. I have to note that one of my friend tried the game at the some times as me and he had access to the shop so you might not get my bad luck. So in short my most negative point about the game might not even affect you.It's at least a few minutes of entertainment and it not only free but also a small download.I don't think you'd lose much trying it out, but I still deleted it after less then an hour (4 missions).

												I don't know why everyone is saying bad things about this game because for me it is amazing. Yes you do start off with crap people but you're playing against dumb AI opponenets so given a few goes and learning all the tactics (that's why it's called ""Fronline Tactics"" not rush through and lose everything really easily) you should pick up the jist of it really easily. The bad thing is that in-game credits are a bit hard to get and to get a new slot you have to buy the soldier with real money, however with steam mostly always having discounts I bought a couple of things from the store and they helped a ton, so don't be a scrounge with this game and stick with the two awful soldiers at the start keep them but buy others as well.

												As much as I like this little game I can't really recommend this game to anyone.Frontline Tactics isn't really a bad game. Sure, it feels like it was someones first video game project they ever made and some stuff like graphics and sound design feels a bit... off considering the game was made in 2012. Part of the reason may be that the game was ported from mobile devices to PC.But that's not really the problem here. The biggest nuisanse comes from the quite thin but still existent pay wall. You need to pay money in order to get powerful units right from the start or play the game for hours and grind your way slowly through quite tough missions in order to get more units. This isn't much of an issue since the game only offers fun for the first few hours and then slowly starts to lose the fun. Missions begin to be repetitive and not really challenging at all after getting your first powerful units and there aren't really many multiplayer players with good unit builds. So you are either stuck with an extremely boring single player or quite dead multi player. Your choice.Oh and I almost forgot. One of the achievements requires for you to use real life money in to the game in order to unlock it... Quite the cash grab achievement for completionists.			"

												It's easy to get into it once you start playing, but then after winning over thirty matches it starts to get get harder due to how expensive armor and weapons are and how high the difficulty rises. However, it's just a game. You earn credits no matter if you lose or win and it helps to learn from your mistakes. Eventually you'll have enough credits to upgrade yourself which will help make it easier to play as your performance is improved. I have the patience for it and this is sure is a game I would play weekly. Yet if you don't enjoy losing once in a while because of a unfair advantage, you might flip tables and end up like the people in the comments below who are complaining something that is just a game. I would suggest a few things to improve the game: #1 would be a sense of realism. In this game, all the enemies rush in at a specific distance from you, I noticed, and it would be more realistic if the AI felt fear in the sense that they'd keep somewhat of a distance if the player was to rush in or throw a nearby grenade. Instead of everything being all gunz a-blazing, haha! My second suggestion is if in defending missions we could create our own base/map to defend off AI's and other players! I think it would be awesome to be able to put down buildings, damaged vehicles and bunkers. My final suggestion is to have our own custom camouflage. Like if we could choose between an array of different colors or maybe even have zombie camouflages, just for fun? The runescape graphics in the game don't really bother me at all and I really like how blood sprays everywhere just by shooting someone!			"

												After playing this game rather heavily for the last week or so I can safely say it is a solid little game to burn time on. Its especially well suited to those moods when you want to game, but also sit back and chill watching something on tv or even just playing with a pet while also distracting your mind.Some call this game pay to win etc. I call BS. I dropped a meager 2 dollars on the DLC complete pack during a sale and that is more then enough of a leg up for even the least tactical minded player to push through the rough start and get ones groove going.Im going to have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable little turn based tactical strategy games with some RPG character development Ive played since the classic fallout tactics and final fantasy tactics , a couple of my fave of the genre.If your looking to start it Id personally wait for a nice discount sale on the DLC to give you that extra oomph, but its not some magic I win button.Im also talking largely from the single player approach. I dont know exactly how the PVP maps play, but if they use your own soldier team then frankly Id not touch it till my squad feels complete from the solo campaign. By that I mean having a solid 5 man squad all with developed primary and 2ndary specialties, and at least the teir 3 weapon in each.That is about where I started to feel like I was playing my characters rather then as the mere meat puppets they start out as in my eyes.Seriesouly if you have any love for the genre, and a few bucks to drop during a sale on the DLC Id stress you DL the game and give it a few missions to pull you in.I think many will be most surprised when they start seeing just how much each unit can be developed and customized over time to suit given play style approaches.Ive re rolled a few characters including some of the pay for dlc guys, playing with comboes to find what I personally like.For example I first tried making my medic a sniper but found the combo so slowed him down as to make him worthless. I ended up using a small arms/ medic who is fairly quick, hits decently hard at close range to defend himself, and move quickly to get to those who need him. A classic field medic approach.			"

												This game being only 24MB to download packed more in it then i expected, You start in a Top-Down scene and take turns to Move, Attack or Defend objectives, The camera is fully customizeable meaning you can move it around any way you like in order to plan your next move; Most turn-based games don't have that feature and it's something i really like in this game. The arsenal is huge ranging from pistols to Sniper Rifles; Everything in the arsenal you can buy with credits you get from completing certain missions although you can spend Steam Wallet funds to boost your credit balance or buy certain items you can't get from In-Game credits; No items in the game give you a tremendous advantage even the items you can buy for Steam Wallet funds; The fact the game doesn't encourage any sort of Micro-Transaction this is my kind of game and i don't see myself dropping it any time soon.The game itself has a Single Player mode and a Multiplayer mode with vast amounts of custom content players create in order to extend the life span of this game.I strongly recommend downloading this game and giving it a shot, It is well worth anyone's time.9.4/10			"

												Turn-based strategy makes it easy to miss bad men and money. The only turn-based strategy that is successful and that of artificial intelligence, while the player proves stupid and devoid of any sense (when the player puts away his troops is useless because the enemies manage to injure and kill the soldiers).

												Fun, simple, no rush game for those that play to relax.  Requires strategy and planning if you want to win battles.  But, can be played just for fun, too. Winning is not everything.Close the game and Steam in order to reset the bases for attacks/defenses/escapes.  The game has a tendancy to favor the newest unlocked bases otherwise.  Downside, it does not allow you to pick from all of them, that were available at certain times in the game.  It does not allow you to always choose your favorite bases.Irritant, it does not transfer well from PC to PC.  When I lost my drive and had to rebuild my PC, I could not restore the past state of the game, even though Steam had all the correct data.  But, it was fun to start over with what I had already learned - since the game has a steep learning curve with very few hints - trial and error.Overall, you do not have to spend a dime to have fun!  I recommend it for anyone looking for a relaxed game (caution: it does have blood splatters and killing.)  I give it my second highest rating - just below Civilation V...RELAX and have FUN. "

												XCOM and Fire Emblem are two of my favorite game series ever created, so I'll try any turn-based games simply because those two got me hooked on the genre. However, there is a reason why I love them, mostly because they are well made and fun to play than just because they are turn-based strategy.That being said, this game ♥♥♥♥ing blows. The graphics suck, the story is non-existent, and if you want to successfully play more than 20 missions it will cost you (a LOT of) real money due to yet another ludicrous free-to-play microtransaction model. I had fun for an hour or so, but it has been awhile since I have played XCOM. This game briefly reminded me of what I have been missing, before becoming about as much fun as finding out you have AIDS.Good: It's free... sort of. Crossfire is a cool tactic and there is a decent amount of customization. Bad: Graphics, Sound, AI, Story, there are people out there who worked on this and/or spent money on this, and I'm not sure which is worse.Ugly: Graphics. Did I mention the graphics were bad? Arbitrary number rating: 3/10 ""Would rather eat a bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥than find out this game is installed on my computer again""			"

												A fun, addicting strategy game for anyone not very acquainted with or those who are not inclined toward strategy games!On top of the benefit of being free to play, Frontline Tactics has lots of reasons to play and enjoy it.  It's welcoming to beginners, paced well as it is turn-based, has an endless variety of ways to modify and upgrade your squad, satisfying awards for winning a certain number of battles, the list goes on.If you're sitting there on the Frontline Tactics Steam page and wondering if you should get it, go ahead and give it a try.  After all (to reiterate), it is free and even my low-caliber, store-bought PC can handle it well.			"

												Played it for a couple hours on my own. It was easy to learn, but the multiplayer system is what threw me off. Instead of a lobby system, you have a room system which is hard to figure out. When in-game in multiplayer, the time that it take for the computer on the other end to react and for it to catch up is really long. The game has some sort of promise, especially for people with old- or low-level computers if they could get the multiplayer to work faster. On a side-note, the game feels repetitive, as you have to redo missions a fair deal of times in order to purchase the equipment to get your troops up to the level of every couple of levels of enemy force.

												Frontline Tactics is what I'd give 1.6 stars. The gameplay is somewhat moderate, using a turn based system. Enemies act realistically, although the damage they take and give is weird, I mean when your shot at point blank range by a SMG, you don't just walk away. The shop where you can buy stuff is always down, and when it does work, it takes up to three minutes to load.The cover system is somewhat broken, with enemies shooting you through a boulder, although it does use a stealth mechanic with cover that works quite well,,,,for the hostiles, not you. Once they see you, you cant hide, but they can easily retreat and vanish inside a crappy hut of sandstone, you know, the ones in the bible.SO, your probably wondering why i'm giving this a thumbs up, well this is why: Its free.Come on, even if it's a pretty bad game, you can't say ""I expected more from something I didn't pay for!""And i'll admit, it's okay, I spent about an hour playing it. It's really not a bad game, and unless you throughly search the games problems, you really won't complain. So just enjoy the game you got for $0.00 and have a good day!			"

												!!!WARNING!!! DO NOT waste your time on this poor excuse for a game! it sucks @$$, its unrealistic, beggining starts off so hard it feels like it should be the last level, getting more enough in game points is too hard even on low difficulty just to get extra men (for example even just one is 100, 000...), plus not mention its turn based which COMPLETLY throews off any realizem (or fun for that matter...), and so on.......

												Frontline Tactics is, as many have said, a free man's XCOM; however, in response to the ""Pay to Win"" complaints, and the ""Pay Wall"" complaints, all that is really needed to get through is tactical knowledge and skill, along with the usual bit of luck. I would give the game a 7/10, with the missing parts being due to the fact that there are just so few maps. However, it is a marvellous way to kill some time, and I have spent many long car trips across the US simply playing the game, thus the 50hr. of playtime.			"

												Frontline Tactics is what I'd give 1.6 stars. The gameplay is somewhat moderate, using a turn based system. Enemies act realistically, although the damage they take and give is weird, I mean when your shot at point blank range by a SMG, you don't just walk away. The shop where you can buy stuff is always down, and when it does work, it takes up to three minutes to load.The cover system is somewhat broken, with enemies shooting you through a boulder, although it does use a stealth mechanic with cover that works quite well,,,,for the hostiles, not you. Once they see you, you cant hide, but they can easily retreat and vanish inside a crappy hut of sandstone, you know, the ones in the bible.SO, your probably wondering why i'm giving this a thumbs up, well this is why: Its free.Come on, even if it's a pretty bad game, you can't say ""I expected more from something I didn't pay for!""And i'll admit, it's okay, I spent about an hour playing it. It's really not a bad game, and unless you throughly search the games problems, you really won't complain. So just enjoy the game you got for $0.00 and have a good day!			"

												Played it for a couple hours on my own. It was easy to learn, but the multiplayer system is what threw me off. Instead of a lobby system, you have a room system which is hard to figure out. When in-game in multiplayer, the time that it take for the computer on the other end to react and for it to catch up is really long. The game has some sort of promise, especially for people with old- or low-level computers if they could get the multiplayer to work faster. On a side-note, the game feels repetitive, as you have to redo missions a fair deal of times in order to purchase the equipment to get your troops up to the level of every couple of levels of enemy force.

												I was hesitant to download this game from the recent overwhelming bad reviews. This is my first Turn Based strategy game so I really can't write a comparison to other turn based strategies. Yes this is FTP and anyone who ever plays FTP knows that it doesnt mean you can get all the upgrades for free. The publishers do put time and effort into these games so expecting a FTP to be a full equal playing field game is absurd. However, with the current sale going on ($1.99) for all the DLC which includes all the soldiers and 700,000 credits to start was top priority. So this now becomes a review on a small sized game for $2. The graphics are nothing to go crazy over and the maps are very small. The close quarters feel mixed with an awkward range of fire does take a couple matches to get used to. After you start to hammer down the gameplay ""tactics"" and start spending some of those credits to give your pistolman a MG, your medic and spec ops guys rifles (or whatever your heart desires on any soldier as each can run with 2 weapons and specialties) then this is when the game comes into its own. This is a very fun game for those of you looking for something different. (I mostly play FPS,  Racing, some Strategy and Third Person shooter/action games). For $2 I absolutely recommend this game. If I had to buy all the different soldiers at $6 a piece this review would never have happened, but if you are reading this on the current weeklong sale that started 1/12, then grab this game. You can download the FTP version (125mb) and test it out if you want, then spend the $2 to start having a lot of fun. So grab your mouse, find some cover and neutrilize those damn terrorists!			"

												This game is quite fun, you fight talibans in variouse maps big and small, unlock new maps and perks after completing a certain ammount of missions (there are 2 flow chart kind of things and you pick what you want to unlock) and you can customize your soldiers with differant playstyles and variouse stats.Its quite a fun game that I play with my friends today (2015) but the thing that upsets me is the fact that the last update was in 2012, this game is cool but I would like some more updates, E.G: being able to play vs/co-op with more than 1 friend; being able to play online with random people rather than with your friends; adding more weapons, upgrades, maps and possibly bring jeeps into the game along with sea fights (your on a small boat and shoot machine guns across boats to kill enemies, you have to get to the oil ring, climb the ladder to the top, take out some guys and capture the oil rig). Also, LADDERS+STAIRS, this game is fun but you NEED to be able to access ladders to get onto roofs or have 2 story houses that way it would make it more indepth.If all of those updates stated above get added, I will be pretty happy with this game, I hope they continue to update it seeing as the last update was in 2012 :(			"

												DON'T get it!This game is a huge rip off of XCOM. It is a freemium game... What can I say. You can get past the first mission and maybe the second if you are lucky, and then you have to purchase a ton of extras like weapons and troops. This game is also quite the opposite of invigorating, it is so boring that my eyballs melted out of there sockets before I even completed the first mission. Yes its free and no its not good.

												Однообразное и тупое г°внище, созданное б-гоизбранными, для того чтобы срубать деньги с быдло-гоев. Если в доте эта задумка заимела успех и каждый год евреи собирают кошерные миллионы долларов. И не скрывая этого распланировали на несколько лет вперёд суммы, с их последующим возрастанием в геометрической прогрессии (про Компендиум, если что). То с этой игрой, наш самый ""талантливый"" и ""умный"" народ планеты знатно облажался.НЕ ИГРАЙТЕ В ЭТУ ИГРУ!!!-----------------------------Monotonous and stupid $hlt, created by God's chosen, to cut down the money with trash-goyim. If this idea had DOTA 2 successful and each year Jews kosher collect millions of dollars. And do not conceal this plan out the next few years the amount of their subsequent increase exponentially (about Compendium, if that). So with this game, our most ""talented"" and ""smart"" people of the world notably screwed up.DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!!			"

												After the first 2 missions you are faced with an onslaught of enemy vs your 2 guys.  Nothing better than 30 guys with assault rifles coming after your 2 men with pistols.  the Tactical options are limited, the AI shoots through walls and you cant tell your guys to crouch or USE cover!Then there is the fact that after the 2nd mission you are required to pay $4.99 or get slaughtered until you stop playing.  No Option to buy more guys with in game currency.  Nope.  $4.99 flat out (PLUS ingame currency on top of that)You earn about 16,000 in game currency from a successful mission.  A new (better?) weapon costs?  16 Million!so prepare to fork over cash AND play 1000 battles just for a better gun.  (or if you dont fork over casy it takes 10,000 games to make that)My solution:  STOP PLAYING...  ERASE GAME.			"

												This game is great. It's laughable reading the negative reviews from people who haven't even played for an hour. Also it's not pay to win, it just requires you to build and use your team effectively. There are some features I would like to have available... mission editor, more control over direction of facing your soldier, freedom to select the skirmish you would like to play... but dude, it's free! If you like turn-based tactical games give this game a try (and play for more than an hour before you wuss out!) It is truly fun.			"

												Videos regarding this game looked really cool, so I decided to check it out. Unfortunately, It is actually very poorly made and provides no fun whatsoever. I thought that this would be similar to Xcom  (An awesome game) however I was left frustrated at how huge a learning curve this game has and the fact that it is not tactical as the title implies. Don't waste your time on this.			"

												If you don't mind endless grinding on the same levels over and over again, which gets extremely repetive very fast, then I guess its an okay game. That is exactly what you have to do if you do not pay-to-play/ win. Most of the levels cannot be beat with the basic stuff that you get and the price of items. It is playable without paying to an extent, but overall I think the paytoplay ruins what might have been a decent game otherwise.			"

												A very simple game and that is all you will get out of it. Massive amounts of grinding unless you pay. Lack of multiplayer that works and often being seriously outnumbered by a very odd AI that will just run past you to shoot you in the back and manage to get a crossfire when they are the only one left on the map while player trying to get crossfires is almost painful. 4/10			"

Good cuz of the simple mechanics and gameplay along with the increasing difficulty. Only thing I don't like is that the enemy also gets whatever you buy, so it does sometimes get annoying when the enemy has two of the same machine gun you have and rambo-kills your team within first 5 turns...

												It's meh.When playing it's obvious that the game is heavily influenced by XCOM:Enemy Unknown with the grid-based movement, turn-based combat and the ability to customise your squad before a mission. It falls short of XCOM by a massive margin, but it's still a little fun for a couple of hours until it gets boring.PROS:-Runs great on low-end systems, and has good aesthetics. I maxed out the game with Intel GMA400 graphics and a Celeron 900D CPU and it didn't stutter once.-Well, it's free-Can be challenging at times, which can make it more fun-Influenced by XCOM, which does make the game easier to pick upCONS--High-end systems don't get high-end graphics options. Apart from resolution a high-end rig won't see much more than a craptop.-""F2P"" mechanics are abysmal. It's a grind once you're out of the starting missions if you want anything ""good"" to equip your soldiers with.-Maps are small, and there's only a few of them.-Still needs a LOT more features to have the depth required for players to want to play more-Multiplayer is dead-Game becomes boring once it gets repetitive.Overall, if you want to play it, go ahead. It's free, and I will admit that I enjoyed the game for the first 3-4 hours (especially since it ran on my laptop, which made it all the more appealing to me). I'm not recommending it just for the cons that I've highlighted, but someone looking for a free XCOM set in middle east/afghan conflict to dump a couple of hours into in your spare time, sure, download and give it a bash.

As you can solo all you want.Its a game with potentials. But sadly I don’t think the devs will do anything more than cash in money from now on.The bad things it is Pay-to-win, yes you can get most stuff by grinding. But lets face it, they want their money back.The AI need really polishing, since you can’t set your men in overwatch, and the bonus of shoot someone with crossfire, you will see some senseless moves of the AI charging you to get on you rear side, and your units will just let them run strait at you. But its fast paced matches, and you can have fun, plus the game is free.			"

												I really wanted to like this game - I've played Fallout 1-3 and a good deal of New Vegas, Wasteland 1 and am still on Wasteland 2.  The first few missions on F.T. weren't bad, but as I got further into the game, the more annoying it became ...I'll start off by saying I prefer turn-based to R.T., and there's what looks like a solid option on here to do either, so I went with t.b.  You CAN do missions this way - but it will end up taking you upwards of 6 RT hours or more if you're like me and you like to turn over every stone, looting as you go ( I hate missing stuff ! ).Ok, so after the first mission or so, it begins to take a really long time - not so bad ?  Well, also, you can't save during combat.  In fact, you can't save AFTER combat either, unless you manage to get back to a base.  On some games I could understand this ... on a game like F.T. where (turn-based) it takes you 6 hrs or more to finish a mission, it's nigh unforgivable.  Even so, that STILL wouldn't be so bad, except ...Whoever designed the layout of some of these missions was a sadistic @#$!  Don't get me wrong here - fighting's great, you can change up weaponry fairly easily, standard stand, crouch, crawl, walk, run ... but when you look at the map and the checkpoints, then eyeball the overall terrain itself, it'd be nice to think if you decided to go one way to get to, say, Checkpoint X on the map, you wouldn't discover 90% of the way there that some hip-high barrels had been placed strategically along the way to ensure that you COULDN'T get there from here ... The iso view is annoying in that way b/c of the level of obscurity you have to deal with (i.e., is that alleyway running behind that building blocked, or is there a clearcut way to get down it and out the other side?).  Generally, any time you have to wonder about that answer in this game, assume the answer is a big fat NO.  The game delights in having you do an amazing amount of backtracking.  Granted, there are a few things you can crawl under.  But there's no climbing over or rolling barrels out of the way.  If you get to a hip high sandbagged wall, there's no way of removing said sandbags from your path so your vehicle can get through ( I tried dynamite even w/o any luck ).  Perhaps if you play the game in R.T. this wouldn't be nearly the hassle that it is in T.B.  Just my 2 cents.			"

												A very simple game and that is all you will get out of it. Massive amounts of grinding unless you pay. Lack of multiplayer that works and often being seriously outnumbered by a very odd AI that will just run past you to shoot you in the back and manage to get a crossfire when they are the only one left on the map while player trying to get crossfires is almost painful. 4/10			"

												It was free and I liked Breach & Clear (first one) and Door Kickers so thought I would give it a chance despite poor reviews.It is decent, with some improvements it could be much more fun.  The strategy and some basic things are lacking. Was wierd, my guy with the machine gun would rarely get his turn while the pistol guy would get many turns. It could be more strategic, a bit too linear.  If they improve it or make another that is better it may be worth buying, but this was free for the first portions so will recommend that worthy of you time if you like this style.			"

												Not a huge fan. Good concept, but way, way too ""freemium"" (the purchasing points awarded per mission, compared to the points needed to buy basic things like a weapon for a soldier or a set of body armor, are way too low...but for the low low price of $5, you can buy enough points for...light body armor. Okay, maybe the items are too expensive even by spending money to get points.) Gets repetitive pretty fast because of the low point rate and the time needed to unlock more game modes. Also, the rate at which enemies get nice things like body armor and good weapons makes things a real pain. I can see myself liking it, but it needs some better combat mechanics, less expensive kit, and more map and mode variety early on for that.			"

												If you don't mind endless grinding on the same levels over and over again, which gets extremely repetive very fast, then I guess its an okay game. That is exactly what you have to do if you do not pay-to-play/ win. Most of the levels cannot be beat with the basic stuff that you get and the price of items. It is playable without paying to an extent, but overall I think the paytoplay ruins what might have been a decent game otherwise.			"

												I had previously posted a positive review but after not playing for about a year I decided to use it again since a major update came out. So heres a narrative of what happened.First thing I notice is that the controls on the menu are messed up. After struggling for a few minutes I manage to get into the singleplayer.Next I notice  that my progress was lost. I didn't consider this a problem since I remember the game being fun and looked forward to starting again.Now I look to select a mission and see that it is randomly moving the mission select around. I randomly click on play mission and get a completely different one than what I clicked on.After loading the mission my controls immediately rush my curser into the upperleft of the map. After trying to coral them long enough to move my characters, I decide to quit and start up again since we now have full controller support.And to my great suprise the controls are still broken when I start up again.I quietly shut down the game and delete it from harddrive so that i never have to see it again.This game used to be good and now it is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to play.

												Not a huge fan. Good concept, but way, way too ""freemium"" (the purchasing points awarded per mission, compared to the points needed to buy basic things like a weapon for a soldier or a set of body armor, are way too low...but for the low low price of $5, you can buy enough points for...light body armor. Okay, maybe the items are too expensive even by spending money to get points.) Gets repetitive pretty fast because of the low point rate and the time needed to unlock more game modes. Also, the rate at which enemies get nice things like body armor and good weapons makes things a real pain. I can see myself liking it, but it needs some better combat mechanics, less expensive kit, and more map and mode variety early on for that.			"

												IIt is a good free2play if it was free. The only tihng you can do with credits, the ingame money, is buy weapons for your guys. To buy more soldiers or anything, it costs realy mon ey. USed to, i could buy other guys with credits. Now they just want money.Not only that, but when you buy a gun for on of your ownly two guys you dont have to pay money for, the enemies you fight get equipped with the same gun.  So i get a sniper rifle to have an advantage but about three enemies in one mission have it as well. If they could work for us and not money it could be a good little free game, but i suggest getting something better like XCOM.			"

												If you enjoy military strategy games...UPDATE : As of October 2014, attempting to load the game results in a black screen of death. (No keyboard input reaction, no ctrl+alt+delete, nothing... leaving only the option to force shut down the computer and pray that it restarts healthy and unaltered. There hasn't been an update in ages and it's unlikely that there are many people playing it anymore.Don't bother.			"

												Servers Are Back !!Ignore all these negatives review, as the game is free and pretty fun four a couple of hours.for Newbies, i highly recommend selling your starter troops, and play with 2 gunmans, easy and useful grenades :DIf you wanna play online or coop, you won't find many games, so you can easily play with a friend, using 2 laptops as game's system requirement are pretty low ;)Only cons: game takes long time when online to send turns to server (until AI did'nt finished all his action, turn won't be sent to next player..)For people too lazy to repeat again same mission and those who hate grinding, i will only say, there is no protection on game, and using *cough* cheatengine *cough* *cough* you can make tons of money by *cough* changing money values *cough*Doing that, you can test weapons easily, but i recommend buying classes, to support devloppers who put servers back online, plus it gives you additional caracters slots :)Have fun with your blood thirsty american soldiers against these unlimited waves of meat coming from hell in survival gamemode !

												Simple looking and working game, ful control over each and every team member.  Not the most awe inspiring graphics but it fits for its purpose.  A special ops squad often outnumbered, or at least in the early stages.My first review for a game, and there is others I played more, but this one..this one got me to break that silence and share about my own fun within.  I've recently unlocked a third team member, do note if you pick the close combat specialization, he starts with a knife so try and unlock that second weapon quick..it takes credits, not real cash.Overall a solid 8/10 for music and gameplay.What would improve on what I've already seen?  Well, one grenade in those odds isn't enough of an equalizer.  Two, purhaps but no more than three would be better.  Too many and the strategy of position and the type of play I enjoy goes out the window, and it just becomes a grenadeathon.			"

												Great Strategy game that keeps me entertained! Played alot of it on the iPad, and its about just as good on your computer. Good cuz of the simple mechanics and gameplay along with the increasing difficulty. Only thing I don't like is that the enemy also gets whatever you buy, so it does sometimes get annoying when the enemy has two of the same machine gun you have and rambo-kills your team within first 5 turns...

												This game is fun is pretty fun when you first start, but very quickly you notice it's flaws. Repetetive maps is a pretty big problem, and you have to keep playing to unlock any more. A major flaw is how you upgrade your soldiers. After a few missions in grinding for that one class/weapon and you finally get it is a pretty nice feeling right? It would be if your enemies didn't get the exact same upgrade that you purchased with your money. Multiplayer is pretty ok, but co-op doesn't pay that much and 1v1s are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥when you can't use all your soldiers because the person you're fighting needs to git gud. TL;DR Game is repetitive, upgrades are useless, multiplayer is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 5/10			"

												I've been wanting to play a turn-based game for awhile without just defaulting to the norm (FF). I also wanted to break away from ""Squaresoft"" look.This game is pretty good. It keeps my interest even in the missions I've already completed and that's good; they definitely give you the impression that you WILL be farming/grinding in this game. From the looks it's necessary ...Two complaints/qualms:1. I'm connected to the Internet ... no multiplayer? NO SHOP? i can't buy a new unit yet and i hope it has to do with  a mission I haven't done or something.2. The interface could be crisper. It takes awhile for the game to realize you aren't trying to rotate or slide the map. I just want to end my turn.WIth all that said ...I'm still playing it.Not a bad job			"
