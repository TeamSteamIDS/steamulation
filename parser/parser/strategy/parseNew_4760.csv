												Rome: Total War is the most highly acclaimed game in the Total War series. Upon it's launch, it was apparent that the Total War series had something different to offer to fans of Turn Based Grand Strategy games. In time, it would become known as one of, if not, the best Total War games ever made. You might ask yourself why out of all the newer Total War games is Rome the best? Well, there's several simple reasons.Pros:- Simple design, as it is one of the first TW games- Large, sprawling cities to battle in, but not too detailed so as to distract the player.- The single best Soundtrack you will find in any TW game.- Large map, but not on a ludacris scale such as Rome II.- Great choice of factions- Campaign and battle map look beautiful- This game can be played smoothly at its highest settings on any modern computer- Massive replay valueCons:- [post suggestions in the comment area]Overall:Rome is a nice and simple, beautifully crafted game. It is what CA was praised for in the Total War series. Rome II is way more technical with a great deal more to learn Honestly, the inlons about this game. Just as I have, almost all major and indie critics have given this game a 9/10, 95%, 4.5/5, etc. This was also given ""14th Greatest Game of All Time"" apparently and I do think it deserves it.10/10			"

												RTW has an epic feel.As of today, this game is nearly eleven years old.  So, the battle graphics are not as crisp as newer titles, the historicity of some units is sketchy (or just made up), and it seems that multiplayer is not smooth in Steam.  Fortunately, none of these mean a thing to me.  The heart of the game is in the grand strategy and the personal narrative.With over a hundred regions in which to play, the strategic game is where RTW shines. You need to plan where you will expand and where you will defend... and then be ready to adapt when the AI does not do what you expect. You may be the pawn of the Senate and serve at their beck and call.  You might try to expand against the weak.  You can follow the trade routes to gain riches through conquest.  You will find yourself occupying regions merely to stymie your enemies (and your allies). Or you might work your way towards all seven Wonders to reap their benefits.The twenty factions all fall into one of the major religio/cultural groupings. Some conquered peoples will not like your religion, but a few might. Some conquered peoples will happily accept you as overlord because you share the same cultural values... and the Spanish clans just don't like anyone. Some factions have great infantry, some have cavalry, and some do many things well.  Yet, you can usually find mercenaries (disgruntled locals, rival tribes, or thugs) who might fill the holes in your army.Yes, most negative reviews harp on about the lag in multiplayer and the poor graphics in battles.  If you need gratuitous violence or managing pixels in a free for all, then watch Mad Max: Fury Road or play League of Legends. If you want to make decisions that will impact your dominion fifty turns down the road, then this game can give it to you.  What kind of temples will you build in each region... or should you let the people keep their native religion?  Will a town become a recruiting station or a cash cow?  When you conquer a region, you'll have to decide to either just incorporate it into your lands as is, relocating half the people by enslaving them, or just slaughtering most of the inhabitants and stealing their goods.... and you'll find yourself using each throughout the campaign, because one size does not fit all.And guess what?  I don't fight the battles.  If I did, I'd never finish a campaign.  I hit the auto calculation button every time.  Why?  Well... there are a number of positions which you will fulfill in a game.  Benevolent multi-generational spirit guiding your family, governor of a province, Commander in Chief, general of an army, and captain of a unit. Playing all of these breaks the narrative for me... I play the macro game, i.e. the big picture.  I plot and scheme, I build cities, and recruit armies.  Then I send them out into the field.  How they do is up to them.  If they win... great! I must be a genius.  If they lose... nuts. Back to the drawing board.Two friends of mine, let's call them Doc and Bro, played RTW like this... Doc played the campaign map, i.e. he decided what units were built and where the battles were fought, but Bro fought all the battles.  Doc was the CinC and Bro was the General.  They played two campaigns in three years, but they remember both as epic stories of their teamwork.In addition to the war... campaign strategy, building armies, transportation of armies, theatres of conflict, fog of war, etc... you'll have to deal with natural disasters, (In one game, a young woman of my family married a promising young fellow, but he died a year later in an earthquake.), piracy, rebellions, brigands, bribery attempts upon your armies, old age, death in battle, adoptions, plagues (stupid unwashed barbarians), and assassination. (In one game, the youngest son of my German leader was sent to subdue Gaul and Hispania. This gave him a command of 10.  I marched him and his elite German veterans across the Alps to conquer Rome... but the Romans assassinated him.  With my hordes leaderless, the Romans proceeded to sieze Gaul and invade Germania.) All of these additional factors help create a unique narrative for each game.Oh, and when you play as a Roman faction, you'll need to keep an eye upon the Senate... how they view you, how the plebs (the masses) view you, Senatorial missions, and the official Senatorial stance with every other faction. For instance, you may have a great trade agreement with the Egyptians and a low standing with the Senate, but the Sentate demands that you attack Egypt... attacking Egypt will hurt your income considerably, but offending the Senate may cause them to label you as a rebel... what will you do?Certain events always happen... Aetna erupts and the plague breaks out in Macedonia, but certain other events happen only when certain triggers occur (the Marian reforms), while others, such as floods, are random.  But the big event for Roman players is the Civil War.  At some point the plebs will want you to deal with the Senate and/or at some point the Senate will either have enough of you or become paranoid of your growing power that they'll demand the head of your family to commit suicide.  If you agree, they'll do it every turn until your family ceases to exist.  If you're not ready for war, then you can comply with the Senate for a few years (and prune your family tree of bad apples in the process), but at some point you'll have to stand up to the Senate... at which point you go to war with all other Romans.  Talk about raising your anxiety.... sheesh!All of your characters really flesh out the narrative... the story of your family.  Spies, diplomats, assassins, admirals, generals, and governors all have character traits that make them who they are.  Some will be drunkards, perverts, and ne'er do wells, while some will be loyal, moral, and cunning.  They'll also tend to generate a following of hangers on, freeloaders, men of honor, mistresses, etc...  For instance, a son might come of age in your family with a command of 3... a natural born general... but on his way to the frontier to defeat the Dacians, his inner circle grows to include a Drunken Uncle and an Actor and they decrease his command ability by 3... Ouch!  He's now a zero...In the first two Total War games, Shogun and Medieval, you had family members, but not nearly as many as Rome.  So to help you manage them (and for the sheer fun of telling a story), RTW includes a family tree.The game's not perfect.  The legendary/semi-mythological units can be frustrating and the Egyptians were certainly not using chariots in the second century BC. Naval combat results can make you scratch your head.  Negative income numbers on the campaign map are definitely misleading. There is always the point at which you know you've won even though you may only be forty to seventy percent of the way to the finish... but that's true of a lot of games.There may be other games out there that have made improvements to the grand strategy game, but I've always found this one to be fun to return to.

												I am the House of Julii.I am to the North of Italy. I am part of the Glorious Roman Republic, sharing with three other factions; the blue Scorpios (I think) who have decided to take a couple of islands and then the big parts of Africa. The green Brutii, who decided that looking ridiculous would best show the Greeks what's what. And I, wearing fantastically imperial red, who was tasked with sorting out the dirty Gauls.I quickly began a conquest that would put the Black Templars to shame, sending out army after army, conquering town after town. They tried to resist, but my men were worth two of theirs, and my men outnumbered their three to one. As we came, we took most of them slaves, built up my core towns, built as many temples to convince more people to shag as possible, and continued on our merry murdering way.Occasionally, the Guals or Brittony or Germans would manage to scrape together an entire army of 2000 people. These were the battles I, and my family, were born for. We smashed together, blood and sword and sinew, as my Velites threw their spears overhead, and cavalry quickly hit them from behind. Few enemies died facing us in the north, many ran and most died with sword wounds in their backs rather than face us.We tried peace once, and we paid the price with roman lives. When they begged for our mercy, they found only our gladius. We heard the lamentations of their women as they were taken back to mighty Arretium, our capital city. And how it had grown; on the back of slaves and the glory of our men, we raised great arenas and temples to show our glory! We raised great barracks to train our men! We grew the greatest of men to enforce our will! And the north of Europe was stained red with blood; the map of Europe was stained red with our flags.We found that land ran out quickly; Europa gave way before our bloodlust did, and we turned to look back. We were disgusted with what we saw. Corruption. Weakness. Our supposed equals made peace with the savages, our supposed superiors hide behind the walls of Rome. They whispered of treachery, but we knew weakness and corruption when we saw it. The spineless Scorpios had no trouble gaining the favour of the Senate; spending more time on their knees in glorious Rome than sword in hand over Carthage. The Brutii failed to live up to their brutish name; content with a paltry pile of sand, growing fat and lazy as we had grown lean and numerous in both flesh and glory.We recalled our armies to home, to the swell of the crowds. They chanted our name, and spat at the mentions of the Senate. All had been united under our banner; did not the Celts and Gauls and Germans and Thrycians alike not bend the knee to the glorious Romans, all beneath the bloody red banner of the Julii? Mars had made his favour clear; he doesn't favour cowards, and Jupiter didn't let the weak rule. We built temples in His Name, and spread his name further than even the diplomats know. All that was left was to follow the glory given to us, under the gaze of the gods and cheers of the people, we marched the final path.All roads lead to Rome.			"

												Rome: Total War is a strategy game from Creative Assembly and published by SEGA. Rome: Total War is set during the timeline of the Roman Republic to its transition into the Roman Empire.Rome: Total War gameplay can be overwhelming for newcomers but its not hard to master the gameplay. First you can only play as Rome, choose one of three Roman royal family. You start on the campaign map with some settlement where you can expand it, train troops, train a diplomat and build your empire. You can engage in diplomacy with other faction such as the Greeks, Egypt or Gaul, make alliances or declare war. When it comes to battle, you can choose to auto resolve the battle if you outnumber the enemy or engage the fight in the battlefield where you will command your troops. This is the best part where you command hundreds or thousands of Roman Legion and Auxiliaries support to fight the Greek Hoplites or the barbarian army and watch them kill each other. Each army can be commanded by a general which will improve the army morale and increase the auto resolve chance of winning. Each general has some skill bonuses that can improve army or improve settlement when they become the governor. As General takes part in battle, their skill bonuses will improve.Rome: Total War is quite addicting to play. When you're done playing with Rome, other faction can be unlocked and then you can play as them. Then you can instead fighting Rome and defeat the greatest empire ever exist in history. The graphics may be old, and some technical issues may occur on newer system, but the game is more than playable. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												Well.....reviewing this game is hard. For it's time, it was without a doubt one of, if not the greatest, strategy games of all time. However, comparing it to newer Total Wars,(except for ROME II, that is something else entirely) it lacks in several things, notably historical accuracy, diplomacy, and managing your government. For one, in historical accuracy, there are multiple nations(like Gaul, Spain, Greece, etc.) that are unified nations even though in real life they were a divided people, with seperate clans, city states, etc. but for some reason CA mashed a lot of city states and tribes together to form unified nations, which is complete bogus. Also, in historical accuracy, Egypt is not Hellenistic at ALL. They still have traditional Egyptian Paganism as their religion, and their units are traditional Egypitan ones, even though Egypt was now practically a Middle Eastern copy of Greece thanks to Alexander the Great. In diplomacy, there are very few options(some examples are trade rights, allaince,  map info, etc.) and, therefore, made diplomacy lose it's immersion. Finnaly, there is governemnt. For Roman factions, the Republic government is fairly adequately displayed, but in general, there really is no ""government system"" like in Empire Total War, although there is a family tree where you can set the faction heir, adding a bit of spice to government. If we put those those things aside, you will find a true classic of a strategy game-and I'm pretty sure most people here would agree with me. In a time where graphics made people look like horrible mutants, AI was as smart as your neighborhood stray dog, and strategy games lacked a lot of actual strategy, this game was revolutionary. The graphics, although considered inferior to today's games, probably looked really great to a lot of players back in 2004.  The jump from the previous Total War, Medieval, to Rome's graphics was absoultely stunning. The AI (which, to be honest, is not very much smarter than the neighborhood stray)  is competent despite occasional errors. Diplomacy, while lacking in true immersion, added a new level of strategy to games, as a system with more than just basic alliance/trade/war was pretty much only used in previous Total Wars and a few other grand strategy games, and even then it was really basic. And government, while being very basic, also adds to the strategy of the game, as you scramble to find a sutiable heir for your glorious (or, more often than not, not-so-glorious) empire. Speaking of empires, there are 20 factions, with about half of them playable, half not playable. Technically, there is a 21st faction, the Rebels. The rebels not only represent actual rebels, which I am perfectley ok with, but they also represent ""minor factions"" that CA left out of the game, which is kinda sloppy to me. However, all-in-all, the campaign is sound, if perhaps a tad disappointing to modern gamers. Now..on to battles. It is not possible to manage a nation without going to war, and this game certainly does not oppose that fact. You will end up in countless battles, usually with random weaklings who think they are better than you, but you will often find yourself matched against a worthy foe. If it is a land battle, you can do one of three things-Fight the battle out on a battle map, have the computer auto resolve the battle, or retreat. For naval battles, you only have the auto resolve option. For the battle map, you and everyone involved-whheter or not they are on your side-will command various units that can be trained in cities if you have the proper buildings. You command these soldiers to victory-or defeat-against the enemy. I personally belive CA did a great job on the battle mechanic of the game.If you like Total War games, strategy games in general, video games in general, or if you like life, then buy this game. Even if you don't like life, still buy it. This is a true classic of a strategy game, and you would be a fool to pass on it if you are a fan of the genre.Overall, 9/10.Also, this game definitely deserves the ""Test of Time"" award. An absolute classic of the strategy genre.			"

												I played this game an unhealthy number of hours before so I had to pick up an original copy just to write this review.One of the best strategy games and my favourite in the series. An absolute classic!This game is a mix between turn based strategy (on the world map) and real-time strategy (on the battle map)8/10 Macro mechanics - you can manage your cities, conquer, develop and train your armies10/10 Micro mechanics - the feelings of managing thousands of units on the battlefields adds both realism and grandeur to battles. Tactical decisions are what wins fights. Positioning and good decisions that are not necesarily split decisions make the clashes immensly fun. DON'T YOU DARE use auto-resolve. You'll miss out on a lot.7/10 Graphics, because it's dated. Newer versions of the Total War series like Medieval 2, Shogun and the new Rome coming out have better graphics if that's what you're looking at, altough you shouldn't pay attention to the graphics.Learning curve isn't steep at all. Modding scene has some goodies in store afaik. Never tried multiplayer but it has to be tons of fun.It's an AMAZING game. It's like a middle ground between games like Civilization and Age of Empires and everyone should at least try it.			"

												They say rome wasn't built in one day, but that certainly depends on how much you play this game, and with a game like this, you can easily get stuck in front of your computer for hours. I've heard some good and some bad things about the sequel to this game, Rome II, so i figured i might try and review this one instead.I realize there's alot of TBS games kinda similar to this out there, but by some miracle i found my way through all those rip-offs and half bad ones, and found my way to this. Anyways, let's get to itNow even though this game might not have the best graphics, it's a good quality game, the game runs very smooth on even the worst of computers, I experienced a surprisingly few number of glitches and flaws. Also this game variates a lot more than you’d think, the terrain and weather and basically all the nature, and even soldiers surrounding the battlefield has an effect on the battle itself, and it manages to create a somewhat realistic atmosphere.You start of by choosing between a rich number of factions to play as, and each faction has their own abilities, starting points, diplomatic and offensive advantages, and of course they all are different difficulties. Now when you start you can also choose different campaign lengths and modes, but the ultimate goal, is to conquer the world. Even after you’ve reached your goal, and have gotten the “You Beat The Game!” message, there’s a lot to do.Now the game doesn’t have many tracks to get you humming along, in fact it has a couple of tracks running in the background, and some music to set the mood for a fight, but that’s in the rough it, and that’s one of the things letting this game a bit down in my opinion.To sum up, this game has a great costumization ability, and is good for a replay, or even two (to all the rome fanatics xD) not the best graphics or music but all in all, I give this an 7/10			"

												Rome Total War Checklist:1. Has good AI? Check.2. Has good mod support? Check.3. Has no DLC? Check.4. Has an actual challenge? Check.5. Has an Expansion worth playing? Check. 6. Has the feeling of reward from success? Check.Conclusion: They don't make games like this anymore. Stay away from Sega and CA's newer cash cows.			"

												The Total War series has an element of elegance to it. Exploring the ways of historical battle as finely and closely as it does is rare, and only some years after its first installment (Shogun) did the videogame industry begin to shoot similar titles. After the legendary Medieval, not many people believed that, apart from a change of setting to a different historical moment, a considerable amount of different content would come up. Then Rome shouted: you're wrong. This game brings pretty much every element of real-time strategy and tactics to the table: city development, troop development and upgrade (besides restoration of battered troops), a ranking system for experienced details that smells pleasantly like Total War spirit, and a turn-based diplomatic conflict and tension only rivaled by the Civilization series, in my opinion.Rome does have its flaws, mainly related to in-battle bugs and primary AI, but its general brilliance is undeniable. Total War lovers meet RTS lovers in this game, as we witness the rise of Rome from the eyes of three powerful political strata of the Roman Empire (houses Brutii, Julii, and Scipii), besides several pagan tribes from central and eastern Europe - some of which you can control after the main campaign has been finished -, as well as northern Africa. A complete set of compelling diplomatic progress is also displayed in Rome (you can constantly set up family alliances, strengthening the power of military stations in cities you control through the maturing of new generals and governors), as well as completude of technological upgrades, and plurality of maps for different battle strategy tastes, from snowy forests of Northern Germany to Spanish plains to Eastern European rocky hills. Rome: Total War puts you right into the heat of pre-medieval belli, the moments of Roman rise and fall, the pressure from the outside and from the inside. Intrigues, military management, civil complexities, and territorial tension.			"

												Been playing this game for 5 years. My first ever Total War game. Activated it on Steam recently. Words cannot describe my attachment to this classic. I have hundreds of hours on it, perhaps even thousands, although I only recently activated it on Steam after the closure of Gamespy made it possible. My all-time favourite for sure.Its successor pales in comparison.			"

												Rome: Total War. One of my all-time favorite games. Taking place in the late Roman Republic, you assume control of one of three Roman families vying for power. Depending on which family you select, the Senate will usually direct you against one of three adversaries - the Greeks, the Gauls, or the Carthaginians. The beautiful thing about Total War, however, is you can simply ignore the Senators and go on a campaign of your own... Egyptians? Invade them! Is the Senate demanding you join in on the war against the Macedon, but you'd rather become allies? Go for it! Just make sure you keep a home guard, because Civil War is a constant threat!It has been almost ten years since Rome's release. It hasn't aged terribly bad - the AI is somewhat atrocious, the graphics are dated, but the game is still genuinely satisfying. At the price Rome goes for during Steam's seasonal sales, there's really no excuse NOT to give this game a try. If nothing else, it is a taste of nostalgia before these types of games became more like movies and less like free-for-all sandboxes!			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Rome Total WarDeveloper:  The Creative AssemblyPublisher:  SEGAGenre:  RTS/TBS hybridGeneral ImpressionRome Total War is one of my favorite video games. I've been playing it since it was launched, in 2004 and even after so many years, it's still very entertaining and challenging. Thanks to the Total War series, I became interested in history and geography, two subjects which shaped my formal years of education. The game's engine is easy to tweak and modify, having a plethora of mods online. The best one remains Europa Barbarorum, a mod which stretches RTW' engine to its very limits. Even if to some players, Rome Total War's graphics might seem outdated, it remains an echelon by which all 3D RTS/TBS hybrids, measure themselves. None are its equal.Strong Points+ Very high modding potential.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- All the units look like clones of each other.- No Achievements.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												How to properly experience Rome Total War. Step one: Start a new game playing as the Romans, doesn't matter the family.Step two: Decide how fast you want to get going by using cheats or not, usually depends onthe mood I'm in.Step three: Create an unstoppable army, or two, or 20, depends how fast you want the world to tremble at your feet.Step four: Send forth your armies into the lands of the barbarians, take their cities and sack them, burn them down, kill them all.Step five: Once the barbarians have been eradicated completely from the map, head for Greece, the home of the intelects.Step six: Send your armies to enslave the Greek peoples, beat them off their high horses and kill them slowly and painfully.Step seven: Once Greece has been pacified sucsessfuly, wait till you have a plauge in one of your cities, you will soon see why.Step eight: once you do have a plauge in one of your cities, get unimprtant agents like diplomats there, keep them for a bit, them send them to the south, in places like Memphis, Alexandria, or Carthage, large cities.Step nine: watch as thousands die from your own little biological terrorist attack, take it in.Step ten: Send your armies to finish off Carthage, Egypt and Numidia, enslave their peoples too, and make sure to kil the pharoh.Congrats, Romam regit omnia, Imperitor.

												In my opinion, this is still the best Total War game to date.Rome's got good combat, decent unit roosters for different cultures, good siege mechanics & decent city ""building/development"". You can also build forts & watch towers on the strategic map.Rome was made before the switch to the new engine, which means that each individual unit actually fight on an individual level, trying to hit enemies & block incoming attacks, instead of the crazy 1v1 kill-animation system. This have a major effect on how battles turn out & how they're conducted. If you got more units of similar skill & situation, they tend to do a fair bit better, instead of it just being a battle of attrition. Projectiles are fairly strong, but as far as I can tell, don't home-in on targets & ready, large shields greatly negate their effectiveness.I should mention that the music is the best in this title by a land-slide, it's always fitting & it's always get's you in the right mood for the situation.The one thing you may miss in this if you're used to the later titles is the naval combat, it's automated in Rome. Also, the graphics are very dated. Camera controls are janky & visual feedback is poor compared to later titles.Compared to the other Total War titles, there's only 3 other games that even come close to being as good as this one: Shogun 2, Medieval 2 & Empire(after milions of patches). I haven't played enough Warhammer to tell how it hold's up yet, but it looks promising.OBS!You may get random crashes to desktop if you buy it through steam, unless you go to the main folder, select everything, put it in a new folder within the main folder & then check integrity of the game & let it re-download everything. The game should then not crash, probably, it worked for me (I use Windows 7).			"

												Let's start with a confession. When Rome Total War was released I didn't buy it, didn't play it. Turn based sounded boring, I wanted real-time because that was cool. So when did I first play it? After Rome 2 was announced, I wanted to play with the ancient world but release was still months away. Then the release was utter garbage. Thus I turned to Rome Total War.So lets start with the TL;DR part.Good: The feel of combat. It's not fast, a bit to slow but formations collide. Good: Size, this game is huge. Large amount of provinces as well as factions. Improvement over Shogun 2, stuck in Japan.Good: Atmosphere, Senate missions as Rome, three seperate factions. Lots of different other factions too.Good: Mods, mods, mods. There some excellent mods out there for this game.Bad: Graphics, the graphics sure aged. Then again it's an old 3D game, they rarely age well.Bad: AI, AI isn't the smartest. The game is easily gamed, then again newer Total War's still are.Bad: Egypt. Egypt was greek at the time, not pharaohs, well not styled like the rulers of old. Just graphics but I'll mention it anyway.Bad: Resolution, no real widescreen support and no 1080p at all. Highest I can get is 1600x1400.So should I still get it? Well it's different for sure. I got into it after I played Medieval 2, Empire, Shogun 2 and Fall of the Samurai. I could make the journey back and was pleasantly suprised. On the other hand my main gaming PC wasn't very available at the time and I played mostly on a laptop. So older games was something I was stuck with either way.Give it a shot if you like ancient history, a slower strategy game and long battles. If you like historical accuraccy give Europa Barborium a spin. From a pure gameplay perspective it has an overwhelming amount of units, recruitment, moving and battles take ages but it's sure authentic.This is a great game, it has aged but not to much. It's deep but not to deep and I'm sort of sad the path Total War games have been taken lately. Still we can go back to this and I recommend you do that.			"

												Rome: Total War is a fine example of game that has aged well, even after almost 10 years of the launch, it's a solid game .Particularly, the Total War series is my favorite when it comes to strategy games, the mixture of TBS with RTS is genial and well applied, allied to the historical factor that their games presents and you have a good source of fun with them.Rome: TW was a title much acclaimed when it launched, for the reasons described above and for its innovation, It's an addictive game that manages to insert you in the campaign and leave you completely focused on the goal of conquer and recreate the legacy of the Roman Empire. The gameplay may seem complicated at first, But you can absorb as much of the campaign map and battles works by playing the tutorial. Throughout the game you can also enable the tips of AI that will enhance learning. The enemy AI is good, although sometimes it may seem very easy on the lower difficulties. The main focus of the game are the battles,  so the diplomatic  and political party is not as well addressed, nevertheless I did not miss this factor.The graphics are outdated but still perfectly playable, the sound quality is magnificent, as well as Hellenistic soundtrack, the speeches of generals before battle is a small detail but shows how much the developers have applied to the game, they are exciting! The Total War series has a solid fan base, it is possible to find many mods that improve, enhance and add replay value to the game. The expansion Barbarian Invasion is a good choice to play under another historical perpective.The downside is that are technical problems that an old game shows, especially in newer OS. I lost a save that was corrupted in a campaign well advanced, it was very sad. Once you learn to play well, the AI also seems to be limited in combat and especially in the campaign, making it easy to match. But certainly this game deserves attention of those who enjoy history and a good strategy game.8/10			"

												Note: I have played this game for embrassingly numerous hours outside Steam, certainly many thousands.The Total War series revolutionized a strategy genre that was stagnating. After years of the same things over and over again, strategy games with only campaigns and no war, sitting and waiting for this mechanic or that to play itself out, games that made the GUI a bit messier and called it depth, features that just made the same stuff a bit more Heath Robinson and called it progress and innovation, battles where you watched columns of numbers, or 7-8 little RTS guys bip and bop for 30 seconds until the game told you who won... Total War brought in a tactical scope with depth to it, actual battlefields where real time decision-making and some sensible tactical considerations played roles, and where the clash was a grand spectacle. In one fell swoop, this series revitalized the genre, indeed carved out its own genre - strategy games where real time wargaming is actually a thing.Then, some time into the series, this game - this beautiful, beautiful game came along. Not content with what they'd achieved already, they made a game so good it broke the mould. Not content with creating their own groundbreaking genre, they then pushed further.It might have aged now, and it isn't such a surprising, groundbreaking thing now as it was back then, and it has its warts and annoyances (like all of the games in the series) but I still have to say that for me, this is possibly the best computer game ever made. Certainly one of the best.Also, it is a great family game, as long as the subject matter is ok for your tribe, we have had many years of fun out of these games. It is not bloody and gratuitous at all, although obviously war is violent in itself.There is nothing else that does computer wargaming like the Total War series, and this is the glorious pinnacle of it. 100/10			"

												WARNING FOR WINDOWS 10 USERS AND POSSIBLE OTHERS: The game got a post-Gamespy update that will cause the game to do all kinds of crazy display stuff and crash. What you need to do is turn off anti-aliasing by default by going into the game's installation folder, preferences folder, then preferences file and make sure AA_QUALITY says AA_QUALITY:AA_ OFF. This should let you launch the game. If you wish to turn on AA from there, you can do so in NVIDIA Control Panel or any other equivalent program, as turning it back on in the menus will cause it to crash again.IF YOU GET REALLY BAD FRAMERATES AND LAGGY INPUT NO MATTER YOUR SPECS: Right-click the game in your library, click properties, then click Set Launch Options. In the text box, type the three characters ""-ne"" without the quotes and press okay. This should fix that problem for most people out there.With that done, I'd like to say that although this game is a bit primitive compared to modern TW games, it still can be a very fun game.  Pros:-The Campaign map is very no frills compared to modern TW games. You can build any building in any city, public disorder is easy to maintain, and it just lacks feature bloat of later games. The game is all about the battles, something I'd wish would come back after games like Attila.- The battles can look and play better than modern TW games in some ways. Losing units will actually be beaten back and enveloped by superior forces, soldiers will respond to orders at different times, and the engagements can have some real clash and weight to them. -There's actually strategy to the strategy map. I wasn't a huge fan of M2/Empire/Napoleon/Attila's maps because they tended to have lots of wide open plains, while Rome 1+2 and Shogun 2 had lots of limiting terrain features where you could create chokepoints and use terrain like mountains and rivers to your advantage.Cons:-Battles can be over a little too quickly. I kind of get whiplash at how fast I go from marching, to melee, to routing an enemy army.-The flipside to things like independent unit movement is that response can be sluggish, sometimes often so bad that I can't tell if the game knows if I ordered them to do anything.-Pathfinding can be garbage sometimes, especially in cities.-You can still get cascade moments where your empire is powerful enough that you're just auto-resolving your way across large swaths of the map at some points.Overall, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the game despite not playing it since roughly around its launch. Once you get over some usability issues, there's a game here that's aged better than it has any right to.			"

												Rome 1 really is the game that got me into the total war series. It's a fantastic gateway game for anyone wanting to get into the series, and has provided me with thousands of hours of entertainment (not all through steam). The game gels very well within itself, campaign and battle moulding together seemlessly. Very few bugs to be found, and minor when they are, also includes everal funny easter eggs. Largely historically, and has a thriving online community. All in all, I very strongly recommend.			"

												Still the best Total War game of all times even it is carries 9 years of dust. However the mods and vanilla game is much more immersive, the battle system is better than in all TW games past it.Also the multiplayer offers much more options than other TW games, and runs  very good despite some known but solveable NAT issues.EDIT:I've played the game extensively since 2004, before I got it on Steam, this is why I have only 80 hours of playtime.You should also try out to play with mods like Roma Surr ectum 2.I rate the game with a 8/10 vanilla.1 point less for the NAT issues in multiplayer and the fact the multiplayer part is now even dead.Originally it should not work anymore because the Gamespy service shutdown, but it still works somehow, the strong MP community is desperated though.1 point less for the battle AI, it will attack at any circumstances and is not very smart in battles.edit:NAT issues have been solved because the game has been shifted by CA from the dead Gamespy platform to Steam.

												The original Rome Total War series is broken on modern computers. Thankfully I found this solution for Windows 10 users who are experiening lag due to modern hardware that worked GREAT!Maybe Steam will include it in their next update, maybe not. IMHO, it provides a MUCH smoother game experience.

												This game is by far, my favorite game. Hands down, no competition. It is old, but I've yet to see any other strategy game come close to this. The graphics are decent, considering its age. The gameplay is complex enough to not be bored and just steamroll through everything, yet simple enough to actually know how to use every feature this game has to offer. The game is basically you controlling a faction during the time of the Roman Republic, and trying to become the best nation. Diplomacy is simple and allies will betray you constantly, unless you would just completely dominate them (and even then, they still might attack you!) The AI is pretty simple to defeat, their entire strategy seems to be just throwing all of their units at you and seeing who wins. The challenges come when you get into the Roman Civil War. This is an in-game event where the 4 roman factions fight each other for control of Rome. Up until this point, you've just been steamrolling through barbarians with your heavy legionnaires. Once the Civil War starts, you're fighting 3 other roman factions (2 of which have just as much land as you if not more, each) and they have the same troops as you. If you're not playing a roman faction then this will never happen, but it's called ROME total war for a reason. If you're into strategy games, buy this game. Even if you're not, you should at least give it a try. The controls might be difficult to use at first, but the tutorial is very helpful. You will probably lose your first few campaigns, but once you get the hang of the game it will be so much fun.			"

												Rome: Total WarThe game that launch the Total War series towards heights that it could've never dreamed of. This game is a turn-based strategy game where you take command the various factions during the Roman Era as you command, build, govern and attack Rome's enemies.The battle system unlike the system you will see in the modern day versions of the game is really simplistic. Sort of like an almost modern update of Imperial Glory. Now of course, the usual complaint would be ""OMG the game is too hard"" or ""OMG the online players are wrecking me"" Luckily the game has an in-depth tutorial plus you have all the time in the world as this game offers various combat both historical and custom made as you polish your skills in battle. And also being a leader of Rome.The advisor system is really helpful as they give advice towards the player. DO NOT turn it off if your new. Keep that option for advisor input set to ""High"". Plus the User Interface for manging your territory and what not is simplistic as well.Now bewarn, save often. Some of the daily tasks that the senate assigns you don't really give you concrete directions. For some of them it's a simple click of the ""zoom in towards target location"" while others it's ""Find this city"" and your just like ""Um okay...WHERE?!"" some of these tasks are important as it may further your position in the Roman government.If you still want a simplistic Total War game this is for you.

												This is a perfect classic of the Total War series. In short, you have the following:1) a huge map.2) massive armies.3) unlimited options when it comes to planning out your campaign.There is so much more I could mention that makes this game great, but I'd hate to write an entire novel about it. Just know that it sets a nice atmosphere and it's a great strategy game.However, keep note of a few annoying things:-Path finding for units can be very lousy sometimes, and there are some glitches routing as well. If a unit is defending the walls in a siege battle and they panic and route, they don't actually route for real. They just stand around idle all the time until someone kills them all off. -The AI, no matter how much of an effort you make, can be incredibly stupid at times. This is a trait common in all of the Total War games, but it shouldn't be too awful except for siege battles.Otherwise, this game is definitely a classic of the TW series. The pros greatly outweigh the cons.			"

												This is the number one game in my library. For over a year, it was the only game other than Spore and the contents of the Orange Box. Five years later, I still go back to it every now and then. I've had many a 14-hour marathon day playing Rome Total War, quite often back to back. I'm pretty sure I got a chance to play as every civilization before I switched computers and lost my progress. I've even gone through the Barbarian Invasion campaign a few times. Honestly, if I'd never bought Civ V, I'd have well over 1,000 hours racked up by now.This is strategy at its purest. Not only do you have the strategy of ""How do I move around my armies and generals and funds to best maintain and expand my empire?"" you also have the battles themselves. Many games do only one or the other, and those games can go hang. I'm not going to go into detail about the games mechanics and why they're good or bad; instead, I'm going to regale you with but a few of the ridiculous stories that have come out of my 800+ hours.*My British faction leader, supported by two other armies, slaughters a quarter of the entire Brutii force over ten years, littering Poland with heroic victories. He eventually meets his end, known as ""the Legendary,"" defending a town against a Roman force three times his size. Succesfully.*An elite squad of Berserkers sacrifice themselves on the walls of Rome itself, eliminating two entire legionary cohorts and flanking the wall's other defenders.*Four hoplite units hold Sparta against a full-size Roman army, earning a 100:1 k:d ratio.*My prize Egyptian army meets a humiliating defeat at the hands of Ponitc troops, navigates around the army, and marches straight into a Pontic city.*A Roman town is betrayed by Spain's finest, throws them off every year for three years until reinforcements can come in and ravage Spain's western coast.*A Carthaginian gambit to take Rome early fails miserably; a generation later, we're back with five armies that now include line-ravaging Armored Elephants.*Betraying Rome by landing an army next to her city - as well as every other non-Brutii city on the peninsula, and bloackading every Roman port east of Palma.*Falling in love with my faction heir, as he's my only general who can fight at night. He later on earns three bonus command stars at night, and sacks Constantine by the light of the moon.It's a glorious game, one with an infinite supply of stories. Go make your own.			"

												Rome: Total War is the Third game in the Total War series, released in 2004. Being 11-years old, as well as having several newer titles in the Total War series, Rome: Total War considerably shows it's age; However, with that being said it is still a fun, interesting game in the overall series. The game takes place prior to the middle ages, After the fall of the Roman Republic, during the Early Roman Empire. As is typical with the Total War series, You start off with a small number of player factions to choose, in this case 3, and unlock additional factions as playable once you conquer them.Also as is typical of a Total War game, gameplay is divided between the real-time battles when in combat, and the turn-based actions of exploration, nation-building, and diplomacy. Rome: Total War has been consistently rated as one of the highest games throughout the Total War Series, based on IGN, Metacritic, and GameRankings, and has a large following, as well as many player-made mods. Despite it's age, Rome: Total War is a strategy game any fan of the Total War series should have.			"

Who said anything about them being troops? They're just my friends, ready to welcome you into the neighbourhood.Say what, why don't we sign an alliance to get things started. We can share trade rights, map information, lots of stuff I'm sure you don't really care about. Tell you what - anyone bothers you, just let me know. I'll bring my friends around again. Deal? What's that? You're worried about me breaking our arrangement? Why would I ever do such a thing? I mean, look at you, fledgling settlement and all. Just sign and accept, k? We're new BFFs!/unsheaths dagger10/10 would meet 'n' greet, betray, pillage and murder you againPROS:Realistic campaign sees you requiring real micromanaging of settlements into cities, taking into account real-life issues such as corruption, squalor, plague, etc.You learn about Roman history and troops REALLY fast and what they're good for.You realize real quick how placing swordsmen in front of cavalry makes for a really bad ending. Light cavalry suck...Hiring mercenaries has its pros and consSlow, patient micromanaging can result in a solid economic empire and allow you to crush anyone in your pathYou want to play while watching simultaneously Gladiator for some reason..ModdableYou can spent easily 100hrs and not be done with the gameYou get easily engrossed in crushing the AI and then get a warm fuzzy feeling realizing that there are OTHER TOTAL WAR GAMES WAITING TO BE PLAYED!!!CONS:I'm experiencing stupid lag on the campaign map while I zoom across the map despite having a beast machine (980 GTX, 5820 i7, 16 gigs of RAM)The game isn't really optimized apparently for multi-core CPUsYou will eventually forget to go outside, much less leave the room			"

												A pretty decent game which turns out to be great with Europa Barbarorum modification. While the vanilla game is okay, it gets pretty boring after a while, because it's just very easy even on the highest difficulty and you just cakewalk everything. Moreover, multiplayer is terrible, because the game is unbalanced and community is terrible. Everybody just gets archers and camps in one place until other players get bored and try to attack but they are then in a losing position. AI is dumb, it plays terribly on campaign map, attacking with only a few units an entire army, leaving cities defenseless and in battle mode they just rush at you blindly, except horse archers who only harass you and run away and you have to chase them across entire map, which is extremely frustrating as it takes a long time.However, even with its shortcomings, it's a good game, and it can be much better with modifications, especially with a great Europa Barbarorum mod that makes the game way more interesting. Is it worth getting today? Or should you just play other Total War game?It is definitely worth getting for Europa Barbarorum, just like Medieval II is worth getting just for Broken Crescent mod. Otherwise... not so much, as the vanilla campaign is much better in ie. Shogun Total War, and the AI tends to be much less frustratingly annoying and dumb there too.			"

It is also easy and fun to mod it yourself.Rome total war provides great fun and gives you the sense of achievement. while it I not as addicting and time consuming as paradox titles it has a unique selling point that the competitors can't provide: you can actually play the battles and the campaign map.9/10 (not 10 for not having sea battles)			"

Rome: Total War is pretty cool, I guess. Back in the year 2000, a time when every music group went out of their way to look goofy, a little development studio named Creative Assembly decided to release a strategy game called ""Shogun: Total War."" The game mixed grand strategy and real time elements to create what was essentially a perfect formula of kingdom management and army control. The game was pretty successful, and two years later they released ""Medieval: Total War"" in 2002.  The game stepped away from the era of Feudal Japan and instead focused on Medieval Europe, hence the name. This game was also a success, and finally, two years later, Creative Assembly released what I personally believe to be their Magnum Opus. Rome: Total War was released in 2004, and that rhymes.Set during a period when killing someone was a lot more difficult because you had to get in pleasant conversation distance of one another. Rome: Total War's campaign begins during the early days of the Roman Republic. Or ""early"", I guess. You play as a various number of factions, some being unlockable as you conquer them in game, each one has a unique quality to it that comes into play during the battles. Now, I'm going to admit, I spent way too much time playing this game, and I'm probably just going to gush on it. ""But Dirk you World Champion Hugger."" You start. ""Steam says you only have 15 hours of total play time.""Well first, shut up, and second: Rome was one of the first PC games I actually bought myself after a long and backbreaking career in pig wrestling. I'm pretty sure I have almost, if not more than 1000 hours all together in this game. Though in those 1000 hours I haven't even played the Alexander expansion, but I heard that's good too. Campaign mode is broken into two segments, the campaign map where you control your entire empire, and the battle map where you command an army in combat. In the campaign map you build cities, train armies, make diplomatic agreements with other factions, and call Carthage stinky idiots for not releasing their hold on Sicily this instant. When diplomacy does break down, then it's time to get a little violent. Invading enemy territory involves you moving your armies around the campaign map like board game pieces, and having them attack enemy cities or armies. When the battle begins you zoom in to get a command eye view of the battle where you command each unit like a normal strategy game.Something that Rome and a few other games had that newer games do not is a captain system where, if you don't have a general in an army, it would instead be commanded by a captain within the army. If the Captain can prove himelf in a climatic battle or over the course of a war, then there's a chance that that captain can be promoted to General and actually become a named character.Generals themselves are fairly unique as well, each of them is named and can be improved or sabotaged independently. With every victory, the general can become a better commander and earn some traits, these traits can be positive or negative. For instant, a general may grow disgusted by war and have no taste for bloodshed, giving his army a morale penality. Or maybe he'll become better at army management and be able to move further each turn. Or maybe he'll just go crazy and talk about how his army will win because they have cooler hats. This and added into a pre-battle speech system where your general's speech can change depending on traits, gives the game a very neat little roleplaying element that helps give a narrative to your campaign. When your lords pass away they leave a history that will stick until the end of your campaign.Commanding your armies in battle is a very easy affair. You can control on unit, or multiple units at once, prepare their formation before the battle, and listen your the general's speech before it all goes down. For 2004, this part of the game was groundbreaking, since it was uncommon to see so many 3D rendered units on screen at once. It still holds up, especially if you put the unit scale to max. But should you play Rome: Total War?Yeah, probably, at least if you're a Total War fan who somehow hasn't played the classics. It's considered one of the best games ever made by people who aren't as great as me, and I would consider it at least in my top 10, if not my top 5. There are some problems, enemy campaign AI get sometimes wig out, having things happen like nations ask for an alliance one turn and then declare war the very next, but there are mods that help fix this to an extent. The modding scene is pretty great as well, with Europa Barbarorum and Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥ coming to mind. I would give R:TW my golden seal of approval and say you should pick it up some way. It usually gets really cheap during sales as well. Rome: Total War gets 5 overly dramatic speeches out of 5. Bananas are curved because they grow towards the sun.The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curationOh man, this review wasn't all that funny, was it?			"

												Rome: Total War was the third Total War game from Creative Assembly, and it was the best one at the time. As it was expected, it was a game of epic-scale real-time battles and impressive attention to historical realism and detail. Shogun was a promising start for the series, while Medieval built on that promise to create an even more engrossing strategy game. Rome took the next step, and it was as much a revolutionary step as it was an evolutionary one, thanks to the at the time new 3D graphics engine that made the series' tactical battles (featuring thousands of soldiers) better than ever. The results were nothing short of spectacular, helping make Rome: Total War the very definition of an epic strategy game and a beloved classic of the gaming industry.

												Rome: Total War was my first Total War game. Due to this game I fell in love with the rest of Total War series. Even though the game may be outdated, the gameplay is still great. Rome: Total War is a top class strategy game. One can control various nation during the rise (or fall, depends on which faction you play) of the Roman empire. I personally enjoyed the combination of city managing and real time battles. I have spent countless hours (don't be misled be my current hours, I have played Rome: Total War long before I bought it on Steam) on Rome: Total War. Who wouldn't want to be like Caesar?If you like strategy games, this is the game for you. The graphics may be outdated, but the gameplay is still solid.In conclusion, I rate this game a 89,89/100.Yes, I can be that specific.With kind regards,Your new Roman oppressor			"

												This game is honestly a modern classic. The progression is amazing, no matter what faction you play as. The battles are spectacular, and epic in scale. The campaign itself never fails to deliver. All of the tiniest decisions matter in the grand scheme, and one wrong move can destroy a campaign. I definitely recomend this game, as well as it's expansions, and in my opinion it is the best total war game to date.			"

												They may try, but they will never beat Rome: Total War.Of course, the game is ageing, and with each new Total War iteration struggling to refine the gameplay it was always going to age somewhat badly. The soldiers which at the time seemed technological marvels now look blocky and cartoony, the campaign map looks less vibrant and more modular, the little portraits, banners and such all look unimpressive and much of the interface seems vaguely unresponsibe, low resolution and unattractive.But they will never beat this game.What was Rome Total War? Think of cars coming into a world of carts, think of chocolate coming into a world of porridge. People had dreamed of seeing the vast armies portrayed as 2D sprites in the original Shogun: Total War in glorious full 3D, and this game delivered in every way imaginable. The roman cities were sparkling, shining in the sun, the landscapes were the scale of the real world and the armies were, indeed, massive. The formations looked just as good as you always hoped they would, and things like charges had the very, excellent, feeling that we had all imagined.Not only that, but the game was deep and huge, with hours upon hours of varied gameplay promised, with any faction we wiped out in one playthrough being available to control in the next campaign - something that Empire: Total War really should have allowed. The (strangely Australian) tutorial woman left nothing to chance, and we never felt out of control, rushed, or under any pressure that was not a direct result of our own actions (all faults that would plague later titles in the series, in my eyes)The characters were great - real world names popping up here and there, generals increasing in effectivness. Money flowed relatively easily if you were but a little thoughtful about it, and developing more advanced troops was intuitive and straightforward.In short, this game got everything right. It has just the right mix of gameplay imposition and gamer imposition, input from both sources comign together to create a sandbox empire building experience that could suck you in and satisfied you for tens, hundreds of hours.Amazing game.

												Where to begin....I first purchased Rome over a decade ago... so the 500+ hours stated on here is vastly inaccurate. Which is a good indication as to what I think of the game. This review is to the point:The simple yet satisfying game mechanics are what keeps you coming back. The options of other factions, and the different unit available within each, means you will have hours of fun mastering the pros and cons depending on who you go. Armoured Elephant units or the Pharaohs Bowmen units are my personal favs.If you are a fan of recently released Total War games, give this a try and find out where it all really began for the franchise.

												Hello, Lets get straight to the point, Rome: Total War is a RTS game, Althought when you look at it you say, ""I think this is what my grandpa played."" you are Wrong! RTW is one of the best strategy games out there, don't let its age and graphics trick you that this is a bad game. If you are new to Total War games this is a game to get you started. RTW take reletively low disk space (2-3 GB) and is amazing at almost every aspact it has. True you might say how is this different from Total War Rome II. This game is easy and you get a good idea on what TW games are based on. This is one of the oldest RTW's but I would call it one of the best. From units to strategies, this game is amazing at simulating a battle, physics are amazing and anything you do changes the world around you. So if you want to play as a roman and expand the wast territories of the SPQR, Become the supreme ruler of the Roman Empire or destroy the romans and erase them from history. This is a game for you.Overall I would say I give this game 8/10 for being absolutely amazing. I really want to give it 9/10 but since it is old and Rome II or TW Attila is more modern, lets stick to 8/10Hope this review was helpful, enjoy the game and take care!			"

												Rome: total war is a great RTS game that allows you to conquer everything from europe to midle east.There are a lot of factions to chose from and there are also many ways to play the game. Even if the game is way too old and the graphics are kinda bad the gameplay is very smooth except from the path finding sometimes. The game is really fun and trust me, you won't regret buying it. In my opinion the best time to buy this one is when it is on sale that its pretty cheap. ~WARNING~ The game might not run in some new computers because its kinda outdated and it was meant to be played with the technology back in the day. I hope you got some taste of what the game is about.			"

												A classic. One of the best pc games of all time.If you've ever dreamed of being an ancient general like Caesar or Hannibal, or conquering the ancient world as the romans did, this is the game for you !The game's main campaign is set during the rule of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire with the player assuming control of one of three leading Roman families. Other factions are playable once they have been unlocked. Gameplay consists of real-time tactical battles framed within a turn-based strategic campaign.  On the large strategic scale, players spend each turn managing diplomacy, developing infrastructure, moving armies, and managing the population's growth and public order. On the smaller scale, real-time battles against enemy armies take place with the player commanding forces that can contain thousands of individual soldiers.The game is also featured in tv series about ancient battles - Decisive Battles and Time CommandersSome other roman themed games : Caesar 3, Qvadriga, Grand Ages: Rome,  Europa Universalis: Rome..

												As the user-defined tags suggest this is a historical strategy game.  The overworld campaign is a turn-based grand strategy- sort of a simplified Civilization.  The battles are mostly real time, with a toggle for 2x or 3x, so I guess it could be argued there is a 4x element to the battle.The campaign takes a long time to finish, but it is good training if you want to play multiplayer.  There are some troops that don't seem to be very good relative to their costs-  I'm thinking the Arcanii (why only 16????????!!!!!!!!!!), but for the most part the game seems pretty balanced.The biggest downside for me was the fact that this game crashes every 4th or 5th battle, and I hear I am not the only person who has this problem.  The public order system can also be wonky- I lost a settlement to a gladiator revolt, then recaptured it and two turns later there was another gladiator revolt with the exact same amount of gladiators. Overall, I would strongly reccomend this game if you like the idea of massive battles, tactical thinking, or time consuming strategic considerations.  I know I loved it. "

												This is one of my favorite games, and, despite what my steam playtime may suggest, I have spent hundreds of hours playing the CD version. I cannot recommend the game highly enough.  The vanilla gameplay is excellent, and there is a wide range of mods that adds tremendously to that - Rome: Total Realism, Europa Barbarorum and others. So why the thumbs down? Because the steam version of this game is essentially unplayable on modern computers. My brand new desktop, which plays Total War: Warhammer on high settings at 60 fps, cannot manage large battles in this 13-year-old game at higher than ~30-35 fps. I've tried just about every fix for this that can be found online, from copying DX9 dlls to running in XP SP2 compatibility mode to running the game in borderless windowed mode at my full screen resolution. I've even turned all the settings down to low, and the problem still persists. The upshot is that this game is simply drastically unoptimized for modern hardware and operating systems. I'm at the point where I'm considering installing windows XP on a separate partition just to see if that will do any good, but I'm not holding out much hope. I understand that not everyone has this problem, but I've experienced it thus far on three modern computers, running windows 7 and windows 10. Anyone considering purchasing this should be aware of this problem.			"

												The game is good, I remember playing this a decade ago. But I'm here to issue a warning: the game runs very inefficiently on newer systems. It was designed and optimized for one core, so if you have a middling laptop, you may want to steer clear. I've even heard of very beefy desktops struggling with it, possibly compatibility issues. You may actually find the newer games run better than this.			"

												So I bought this game on the steam summer sale. I have no regrets so far.I'm mainly more of a FPS type of person but playing this in some aspects is way better. First 10-15 matches online (you would be suprised at how many people still go online) I got clobbered but I started learning the keybinds and ways to space units out to make them for effective. Haven't touched much of the single player but when I did I played for about 1-2 hours. (Was really good).As I said before, a lot of people still play the online aspect which is always fun.Overall great game! "

												Rome Total War was in many ways the best that the Total War series had to offer, it was the game that took a giant leap forward and set the standard that it's own developers have yet to break. Despite game breaking bugs and broken promises about modding support Rome Total War still manages to give you a grand experience as you grow your empire towards total domination.   For those who have never played a Total War game it has two distinct elements to it, the first is the campaign map, this is an overview map where you build your cities, train units, send diplomats and assassins to your enemies and friends and move your armies around in a turn based grand strategy style and while it has nowhere near the dept of a true grand strategy game it does the job well enough that you forgive it, especially once you start to touch upon the second, and the most important, major aspect of a Total War game, the battles.   When two armies meet on the campaign map you are taken out of the turn based strategy and thrown right smack in the middle of a real time strategy battle with hundreds or perhaps even thousands of soldiers ready to fight and die. You move your soldiers around in squads of archers, swordsmen, cavalry, etc. Each faction has a semi-unique list of units they can employ, from the various types of Roman Legionaries to the Carthaginian War Elephants to the hilariously historically inaccurate flaming pigs. Each unit has it's own skills and abilities and while there is some level of rock -> paper -> scissors involved, the majority comes down to tactics, sure Spearmen beats cavalry, unless the cavalry happens to be charging them from behind.The game is pretty too, with a good amount of detail considering the scope of the battles, the soundtrack fits almost perfectly with the mood of the game and sounds of battle are utterly satisfying. Even the load screen are great, each one featuring a different quote from a period persona although a lot of mistakes were made by whoever typed in those quotes.It is not all roses however, Rome has a number of problems too the first and foremost of which being the same one that continues to plague Total War games to this day. The AI is completely and utterly inept. Whether it is trying to assemble an army by sending individual units walking through your territory one by one, letting you eliminate them piecemeal or displaying it's rather uncanny ability to form a perfect battle line and then break it in half just before engagement letting you flank the enemy at will you can't help but feel that this is somehow below the standards of the rest of the game and in fact modders have proven that making the AI not suicide every battle is indeed possible.In addition to that rather large issue there is a number of smaller ones, the campaign map is incredibly shallow and while the movement style is a big leap up from Medieval it still feels very arcadey. The squalor bug, or feature, as the developers would call it, whereby all cities automatically revolt if they grow to a certain population size. The lack of full scale modding, although Rome features a bunch of great mods there are certain things you are simply not allowed to do, such as adding more factions to the game. And despite the developers saying it's possible and banning people from their forums who says otherwise, it really isn't possible.Also the game throws any sense of historical accuracy out the window, from the equipment to the map to the very factions very few things in the game represent the time period accurately, this is something that will bother some people while others will ignore it. For me it only becomes annoying when people take their knowledge from Rome and try to apply it elsewhere.All in all, Rome Total War is a great game, it set the standard for all Total War Games to come and despite a number of annoying bugs and problems it still remains a great game to this day.

												Have played Rome: total war every now and then since 2004. Just finished my latest 20-hour campaign in the game, so this is without doubt playable even as in 2016 there are more modern total war games available. Didn't experience a single crash while playing (windows 7).Rome has some some issues: archers are undoubtedly underpowered, whole army can rout within seconds after the fight begins, senate's missions are sometimes nosense, AI can't handle siege battles, AI campaign logic is from USSR, etc.When Rome was released in 2004 it was a solid 10/10, something that haven't seen before. You can greatly improve the main game with wide variety of mods. When played today you can see the flaws, but still want to play just one more turn.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												Totally addictive.  A great game. If you are looking for something to fill up quite a bit of time for quite a small amount of money this is it.   It took me forty hours or so to get through one campaign, that is win one game.  After finishing a campaign successfully you can pick any of the nations on the map to use.As for the gameplay yourself you start off with some citystates.  You must develop your cities in order to increase monitary capital, defenses, religion, law and order, sanitation etc. all the while keeping the citizens at a content state.  They can and will revolt and kick you out if they get to dissatified.  You also must recruit a variety of soldiers to defend your cities and conquer other cities and generals.  You build siege weapons, ladders, siege towers, battering rams, or later when you get them elephants to scale or break down walls to take other fortresses and eventually rule the world!As you can tell there is a bit of a learning curve with  this game.  Save often at first.  With a little bit of patience you can learn to do all I have mentioned and more.  This sort of game is not for everyone, however, it is hard to know if you are really going to like it unless you give it a sincere try.  The game is a bit dated and can be hard to load at times.  Once loaded I have noticed no bugs.  It is a good game if you have a computer that is not 100% up to date as it will work on older computers that might not have the specs for the newer Total War Games.  So far I have played Total War Rome, Shogun 2, and Medieval.  They are all enjoyable in  their own ways.  So for those asking which game is the best I would recommend getting the one for the area of history you are most interested in as long as it will work on your computer.  If you like it you will most likely enjoy the others as well.			"

												Rome Total War is inarguably the best in the Total War series, with Medieval 2 coming in a close second. This game is a must have for all RTS and Grand Strategy fans! This game is perfect for a newcomer to the total war series, it's simple and easy to get into but tremendous fun to play.  Don't be discouraged thinking that old games are stupidly hard, with cluttered UI and bad graphics, it's not the case here!The city management and diplomacy is interesting. The UI is polished and easily understandable.  There's a great unit variety and especially the Roman legions are really interesting. There's nothing like mowing down hordes of barbaric tribes with your Legions. Sure the graphics are outdated but it still looks decent, at least you can crank them up to the max even on an old laptop. Total War Rome looked WAY better in it's age (2004) than how Rome II looks compared to today's standards. There are a huge number of mods, and complete overhauls out there to further enhance the gameplay and graphics. When you buy the game you also get the Barbarian Invasion DLC included which places the whole game to a completely different aspect. There's also another expansion called Total War Rome Alexander but it's perhaps the most forgettable one in the franchise.This game is in my personal top 10 of all time, worth every penny if you like strategy games go buy it and I guarantee you won't regret it! I played hundreds of hours of it (I owned a physical copy).			"

												I love Rome: Total War. It was one of the first strategy games I played. I sunk hours into this game, playing it long in to the night. Just one more turn... just one more battle... It's highly addictive and great fun.So why do I NOT recommend this game? Because the Steam version seems to have a serious problem with modern systems.I originally had the Gold collectors disc (that includes the base game plus the Barbarian Invasion and Alexander expansions). It ran fine on an older Core 2 Duo laptop with integrated graphics on medium settings. However, I'm currently trying to run the Steam version on an HP Pavillion laptop that has an i5-6200U CPU and NVIDIA GeForce 940M graphics card. If I max-out the settings it runs at about 8 to 10 fps. If I turn everything down low I can coax out 25 fps.From the forums it seems I'm not alone in this predicament. A number of ""fixes"" have been suggested but none of them have worked for me. Apparently the disc version works OK but I stupidly gave it away.I will undoubtedly continue trying to resolve this issue and if I do then I'll gladly update my opinion but for now I simply cannot recommend anyone buy this game, even though I love it so much.

												Rome Total War is in my opinion the greatest achievment in the Total War series its gameplay was revolutionary at the time and is still fantastic today it sets the standard for all the Total War games that have followed it and i belive they should all be compared to the brilliance of this game. Rome Total War brought us an entertaining and fun campaign that allowed us to forge the ancient world as we desired. But this game is at its supreme best in terms of multiplayer which is still amazing nearly 10 years after its release this game got me into multiplaying full stop. It has a great variety of factions to choose from and with each having a very different approach to warfare which gives the game loads of different tactics and army builds to utilize and choose from. i advise this game to anyone who wants to play the Total War series it is amazing fantastic and just a brilliant experience which you will love if you like stratagy games.

												Rome: Total War is the oldest Total War game available on Steam, and can be considered the basis of the rest of the games which followed (although I would totally rebuy Medieval: Total War if they ever added that). In previous games, the overlying board played like a giant Risk board, where you moved armied from province to province, instead of having the entire campaign map laid out and moving your armies to specific locations. This was a DRAMATIC shift for the series, and one which really helped to establish it at something unique from other strategy games.Like all Total War games that followed, you move your armies around the map to strategic locations in your turn, then the rest of the other players' turns elapse. At any point where two armies meet and fight, the option to autoresolve or fight on a tactical campaign map is provided, which is where the real-time portion of the game takes place.Rome is also the first game in the series where the armies were polygonal as opposed to sprites, which was a RIDICULOUS feat for graphics at the time. It's still relatively streamlined compared to modern Total War games, but it still stands up to this day. It's an excellent, excellent game, and well worth playing even now, a decade after its release. While I don't personally hold it up as the best example of the series, I know many people who do and I cannot fault their opinions - this is a damn fine game.			"

Remove the age of the game and the more primitive graphics (like I said though, it's an old game and for it's time it looks amazing) and there really are no downsides to this game in my opinion, but I am a massive fan of the Total War series so I may be biast, so just see for yourself!

												Great game ... nicely made ... but with lot of non historical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and few things which will make you angry everytime you play. But still if you want to create empire of Britons through the whole Europe ... riding over your enemies on the war chariots or smashing Testudos with rampaging war elephants this is really game to make your dreams come true.

												Looking for the best RTS game money can buy? then look no further. Rome: Total War is by far one of the greatest games in Total War history with the best balanced gameplay in any Total War game.You run an empire of choice, first you must unlock other factions as this game is focused on Rome so you are only able to choose from them at first. Beat the main game and you unlock a smattering of factions. Then you can also hack the game files and unlock every other non-playable factions and of course play as them. Great fun.This game is many years old but the graphics stand the test of time, still pleasing to the eye as well as the first fully 3D Total War game.The game can range from been easy, to a total nightmare of course that also depends on the players skills. Something negative is really, the Rome factions on the higher diffculties are amazingly tough, but they are also overpowerd to play as. Overall amazing game easily a 9.8/10 :) - Dean			"

												Rome: Total War is an incredible game. I remember buying it discounted at EB Games and thinking 'I can play this for a couple of hours'. Oh, how wrong I was. I played over 150 hours in less than a year (not really an acheivement, granted) and enjoyed every moment of it. Oh, how satisfying it is plundering through Gaul with highly trained Roman legions and crushing successor states under your hoplite phalanx. The game really put things into perspective for me. It showed me how the centuries-old Greek phalanx was finally swept aside by the Roman legions. Mind you, I was overpowered by them when I first tackled them as the Romans. My only proper disappointment is that Rome is overpowered (to be fair, it was at the time but not as much), Hellenistic pikes are underpowered and Egypt is anachronistic and overpowered.All aside, I've spent much time playing this and have loved it. Nothing is more fun than tearing chariots to shreds with Spartan spears.			"

												It looks like I haven't played this game much, but that's because I owned it on disc before it came on steam. Yes this game is old, but it is game is still one of the most amazing and in-depth games I've ever played and still my most favourite singleplayer strategy game of all time. This game is an absolute steal at the current price. Highly reccomended.			"

												Close your eyes. Breath in the moist grass. The sweat of soldiers, armed to the neck with shields, swords, spears, and bows. Now, feel the ground beneath you shake, the war cries of the Gauls sending shivers down your body. The onagers and repeating ballista creaking along the grassy pasture. The synchronized march of the Roman army coming to meet the opposition. You open one eye, admiring the shiny--CLOSE YOUR EYES I SAID. Now, ahem, raise your arms into the sky, feeling the breeze and the tension of a battle wafting through your hands. Close your fist around that air and hover lightly into the air, looking down at the approaching armies. You're actually a quadrocopter, so you can float.Seriously, however, this game is amazingly fun. The campaign is captivating and the custom battles are entertaining. The possibilities are endless. There are so many factions and armies to make! Strategies to plan. Armies to deploy. Units to command. Towns to conquer. Upgrades to be made.I recommend this game to strategy game lovers!			"

												Though aged now, the original R:TW was a fun and genre-establishing product of its' time. What I haven't done 'til recent times was try any mods for it.  If you're a true fan of ancient history/ancient warfare, I would highly suggest the Europa Barbarorum (1.2) mod, which adds incredibly depth of historical accuracy, and a myriad of changes to the way the game works and unit/texture differences. It builds upon the old structure and enhances it to the extent that the vanilla/original game appears cartoonish and amateurish in comparison. For anyone who has wondered time and again why for instance our ancient Romans seem to be popularly portrayed extensively in a modern UK english accent, (for some bizarre reason), you'll be happy to hear true latin, ancient greek and celtic languages. Units are also elaborately detailed, and given large, informative descriptions. It's part history-lesson, part classic R:TW experience.It is also an extremely entertaining challenge to seasoned veterans of the TW series like myself.			"

												Not only a classic of the genre, but also the best of the total war series imo. This game beats every other title out there in terms of a combined turn-based/rts historical game (especially with mods, which virtually increases the game length by hundreds--possibly thousands--of hours. Graphics: They're okay for its time (about a 6-7/10), but it may feel outdated for some newer gamers. Try some mods, and it'll feel more new. With that being said, about 7/10 with the mods in mind.Gameplay: Very smooth, responsive battle animations. If you can control your cavalry well, you can handle any opponent with proper flanking and timed troop engagement. The turn-based aspect may seem somewhat outdated, but there are mods that will bring the diplomacy among other parts of the game to unrivaled levels. 10/10I'm not going to comment on anything else, since I think this game is all gameplay with some visuals to create immersion. There is a grand and truly epic feel to the campaign, so anyone with some interest in history would enjoy it. "

												I was looking for new strategy games, and I didn't find any that would match the simple, straight forward, but always replay-worthy quality of Rome:TW.Of course, it is outdated now. Of course Rome II for instance has much nicer graphics. Of course, Rome:TW has its flaws.What the newer games all lack is the concentrated energy of this old style game. They give you bling bling, but then they limit your playing experience because the devs want to shape the way you play a game, instead of presenting the player with opportunities.I'll give you a - limited - example, just to show the main point, I could go into detail in many respects, but here's one that should show what I mean in principle. In Rome:TW, you could march an army without a general into hostile territory. Or you could scale walls with a single infantry unit - it's your choice (and your troops' funeral, perhaps). In Rome II, you are forced to recruit a general. You must replenish resources, even if you would like to get an advantage by sacrificing some units. You cannot win a game based on skill and creative tactics, but only by playing by the book. But the game will throw an achievement your way in exchange for freedom...I miss old style games like some old software, that did exactly what it was supposed to do and nothing else.Time to besiege Alexandria, brb			"

												Rome: Total War is the third Total War game from England's Creative Assembly, and, to make a long story short, it's the best one yet. It was naturally expected to build on its illustrious predecessors, which featured epic-scale real-time battles and impressive attention to historical realism and detail. Shogun: Total War was a promising start for the series, while Medieval: Total War built on that promise to create an even more engrossing strategy game. With Rome: Total War, Creative Assembly takes the next step, and it's as much a revolutionary step as it is an evolutionary one, thanks to a beautiful new 3D graphics engine that makes the series' tactical battles--featuring thousands of soldiers--better than ever. The results are nothing short of spectacular, helping make Rome: Total War the very definition of an epic strategy game.Where do you want to go today? The ancient world beckons, if you're brave enough to take it on.As in the earlier Total War games, there are essentially two distinctly different types of gameplay in Rome. There's the overarching turn-based campaign in which you conquer cities and provinces, make improvements, and move armies around the map as you expand your empire, and then there are the real-time battles in which you use tactics and maneuvers to crush your enemy in combat. After the helpful and informative tutorial campaign, you can tackle the main imperial campaign. You play as one of three powerful Roman families--the Julii, the Bruti, or the Scipii--attempting to increase the size and glory of Rome and shore up your faction's power and influence. As all three factions are Roman, there's literally no difference between them in terms of units and building types, though they do have different responsibilities. The Julii must deal with the Gauls and Germania to the north in a difficult, landlocked campaign. The Bruti are required to deal with the remnants of the Greek city-states and expand the empire to the southeast. And the Scipii are tasked with subduing Carthage, Rome's great nemesis to the southwest.At least, that's the principle goal of each faction. But there's a fourth, unplayable Roman faction, one that can influence your course during the campaign: the Roman senate. The senate will order you on missions, from blockading a hostile port or conquering a city (and perhaps exterminating the populace, depending on the level of enmity between Rome and the faction in question) to forging a trade deal or an alliance with a foreign faction. It's up to you whether you actually obey the order, as sometimes the senate will try to stretch you thin on purpose. If you carry the orders out successfully, you stand to gain a monetary reward, a useful new military unit, or influence in the senate. Failing to carry out missions earns the displeasure of the senate and affects your standing with that body. By and large, though, the senate missions help to focus the otherwise huge scope of the campaign--instead of being faced with the monolithic task of trying to conquer Europe, you can instead look forward to accomplishing a long series of short-term goals.It's helpful to perform senate missions because they can affect an improved feature in Rome: Total War--families. Each of the three Roman factions is essentially one huge family, and your generals and governors are related to one another by birth, marriage, or adoption. These are the leaders of your faction, and they all have traits--strengths and weaknesses--that define their abilities. A strong general may have an excellent command rating, but his disdain for bureaucracy would make him a poor governor. Meanwhile, an otherwise strong governor may have a dislike of farming, which would affect the agricultural output in the province he's in. But if your family members are selected to hold important senate posts, they'll gain influence and abilities once out of office. This introduces a limited role-playing component in the game, as you actually care about trying to further the careers of your family members so they can serve you better.In addition to traits, family members--not to mention your spies, assassins, and diplomats--can all attract retinues. These are the hangers-on who surround important people, such as advisors, mentors, bodyguards, lackeys, sycophants, and more. Each of these can affect your characters' abilities. For example, a wrestler can improve a character's influence (by being able to literally twist arms), as well as provide added protection against an assassination attempt. You can actually collect and trade retinue members among your family, so you can transfer them to where they're needed the most.You'll draw your faction's leaders from the family tree. Make sure not to kill off your heirs in battle.Families are also critical because only family members can serve as generals. You can assemble armies without a general, but they'll be poorly led and will likely fare badly in battle. But with a general, the army's fortune can change. A general with a high command ability is a powerful force in battle, as a well-led smaller force can defeat a poorly led larger force most of the time. On the other hand, the fact that generals are drawn from the ruling family can be dangerous, because you need to make sure there are future generations of leaders and generals. A disastrous battle can wipe out whole branches of the family tree, cutting down promising young sons before they can sire heirs. This can have a crippling effect later on in the campaign, when you find yourself short of qualified generals and governors with a huge empire to manage. It makes for an excellent incentive to try and preserve your generals, rather than treat them as easily replaceable fodder.Thankfully, when you're short of governors, your cities will be taken over by the ""automanager,"" which is represented by an appointed official who runs the city in your name. You can give the automanager certain priorities, such as to follow a military or financial policy, and it will go about constructing the building and units required. (You can also turn on the automanage functionality in cities that do have governors, if you don't want to micromanage at all.) The computer is generally good at doing what you tell it to do, and this should appeal to players who don't want to spend a lot of time on the campaign map. But if you're a fan of grand strategy and want to control every detail, you'll want to make sure you have plenty of family members at your disposal.You can choose to autogenerate battle results or fight the battles personally. In most cases, it's easier and simpler to autogenerate the smaller fights.You can choose to autogenerate battle results or fight the battles personally. In most cases, it's easier and simpler to autogenerate the smaller fights.When you're not busy trying to crush your opponents, you can try to spy on, trade with, and subvert them. The diplomacy system has been completely overhauled since Medieval: Total War, and you now have a lot more options at your command. These include forming alliances, bullying your neighbors into becoming protectorates of Rome, and bargaining for trade rights. You can also dispatch spies and assassins to probe for weaknesses in enemy defenses, or to take out a key enemy general before a crucial battle. And in a nice twist, you can plant spies in your own cities, where they'll help keep unrest in check by acting as a secret police of sorts, rooting out the troublemakers. I definitly recommend this game to people who enjoy a good, long, legendary campain.			"

												On older games, you will often experience performance that is less than optimal given how modern hardware should be able to shred older titles. However the Steam version of Rome Total War Gold somehow manages to lower performance even further by an exponential level, to the point where you will experience single-digit FPS numbers on large battles. For whatever reason, this effect seems to be amplified even further on the Alexander expansion.Apparently this has something to do with the switch from Gamespy to Steam servers. Anyhow, the only reason to buy this on steam is for the multiplayer, which is almost completely dead anyway. Performance is absolutely unacceptable.			"

Or, sending an assassin to kill an enemy captain, maybe send your diplomat to win over the enemy?However you choose to play the game, it's up to you. But it is definetely worth the price tag! 8/10 "

												I was the romano british, and most of europe was under my grasp. I had forged a strong alliance with the east and west roman empires, and most of the hordes had crumbled beneath my combined arms tactics. My graal knights ruled the world, and history was as it should be. Then the eastern roman empire decided I was making too much trade on londinum and landed there en masse, the same turn that the huns came out of hiding. The western roman empire, confused on what to do declared war on everything that breathed. Civilization crumbled again, and I will now have to spend another sixty hours piecing everything back together again.The game is a great strategy game, and the campaigns are fun (The modded ones are good fun as well) but for the love of god find a campaign AI upgrade.

												Now superceded but a great game in it's own right - I immensely enjoyed playing the long  campaigns of all 3 familys in this game.    Each one plays a litttle differently to maintain your interest - and because of their location will have different strengths and weakness's.  Should you buy it? - Yes if you like action oriented strategy and tactics and or historical warfare.I like it enough to have bought it in boxes and from 2 different companies digitally as well. And it runs fine on most modern computer systems so you shouldn't need to break the bank on new hardware either.Of late (July 2015)  I have noticed a move back to this game from Rome II - with some saying they have dumbed the AI and gameplay down in the new one in favour of better graphics.

												This is a game where you actually fight the battles, using tactics to win them rather than statistics. Where if your army is inferior you can still win. The battles can involve thousands of soldiers (if played on huge scale), with a maximum of 20 units of soldiers per army. The AI is rubbish, but ignore that. The campaign isn't the selling point of this game, it is the battles. There's online ones too. Whatever. Get this game, it's cheap. "

												I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a strategy game.The spectacular graphics and extensive detail behind each character and race.Whether you choose to play as a Roman or a Gaul, each family member has their own traits and differences, so every new playthrough has it's own new experiences.The battles are utterly amazing, whether you're flanking your enemy with cavalry, using your archers to hold off twice your men, or bringing reinforcements that either you or an AI can control.Then there's the diplomatic side to it, you can put a spy in an enemy city in the hopes that when the time comes, they manage to open the gates for your men. Or, sending an assassin to kill an enemy captain, maybe send your diplomat to win over the enemy?However you choose to play the game, it's up to you. But it is definetely worth the price tag! 8/10 "

												Very fun game. Really addicting. For me the multiplayer isnt what I thought it would be. The multiplayer is a lot more fun when ur playing with a friend than a random guy. The campaign is the reason why I am stuck to this game. Every time a capture another region I feel powerful. And plus it tought me a lot about roman history. This game was also used to depict real historical battles in a show called Decisive Battles.			"

												When this goes on sale, there's just nil reason to not buy this game. The modding community is still active, presenting you with a plethora of game overhauls or additions on a smaller scale - whatever your preference - along with a healthy multiplayer mode and an endless supply of singleplayer conquest. If you're remotely interested in the strategy genre, you can't pass up what is one of the best PC games of all time.			"

Challenging and a really exciting view of the battlefield are some of the good points of the game although I still find the game a bit long and frustrating sometimes. But, play this game and you'll understand why people are so disapointed with Rome: Total War 2. Rome 2 failed to live up to this game.			"

Rome Total War by far is one of the best strategy games to ever break into the market. Though the graphics are a little outdated, considering it first came out in 2004, the gameplay, unit selection, campaign, and my personal favorite, Multiplayer are outstanding. One of the best, if not the best game in the Total War series. I would recommend this to anyone who is a lover of Ancient Warfare, Ancient history, military history, and real time strategy games. Even if you dont' like any of those topics, play it anyway, because through this game one may sprout an interest in one of many subjects relating to this games history.			"

And apart from the graphics/resolution, a game spoiling bug (epic seige bug) and the quite boring building structure, compared to later games, this game is still my prefered TW game even over rome 2!This is a great game to get if you are a TW fan and want to play on a low spec laptop.It is not about the graphics like more modern TW games, for me it is the far more simpler strategy and building management that would make me suggest for people to buy this game.The building structure was quite simple as was the diplomacy, army management etc.. essentially, when you know what you are doing, maintaining an attacking flow and constant faction progression is a much easier task than R2 for instance.Perfect for playing when you don't exactly want to invest a whole amount of mental energy to a campaign, but want to succeed, and enjoy a great TW game.

												This is a game where you actually fight the battles, using tactics to win them rather than statistics. Where if your army is inferior you can still win. The battles can involve thousands of soldiers (if played on huge scale), with a maximum of 20 units of soldiers per army. The AI is rubbish, but ignore that. The campaign isn't the selling point of this game, it is the battles. There's online ones too. Whatever. Get this game, it's cheap. "

												Rome Total War is a war simulator that takes place during the Roman Empire. You can play on a variety of sides during various skirmishes and all out battles all over Italy.The game in general is entirely reliant on combat and tactics. Moreso then most strategy games, which tend to feature other factors like base building or RPG elements. With Total War, it's exactly what it says on the tin. War, as it was fought 2000 years ago. With thousands of troops and commanding 30 units in a single time rather then a handful.			"

												As a huge advocate of the Total War franchise, id say this is hands down the best Total War game ever made. Even with CA's recent release of Rome 2, it still does not compare to the level of pure effort put into Rome 1. Rome 2 is horedously buggy, overpriced, naval combat is a plus, but only makes the game more tedious, just as it did in Napoleon and Empire, and simply uses new age graphics to lure players. No game should be judged by graphics, onl by gameplay mechanics, sound, community, and execution. Anyone who says ""DONT GUY THIS GAME OUTDATED GRAPHICZ SUX BUY SHOGUN OR ROME 2"" is inceccantly butthurt about losing 60 Dollars to the shitpile that is Rome 2.Buy this before you play ANY other Total War game.

												As a huge advocate of the Total War franchise, id say this is hands down the best Total War game ever made. Even with CA's recent release of Rome 2, it still does not compare to the level of pure effort put into Rome 1. Rome 2 is horedously buggy, overpriced, naval combat is a plus, but only makes the game more tedious, just as it did in Napoleon and Empire, and simply uses new age graphics to lure players. No game should be judged by graphics, onl by gameplay mechanics, sound, community, and execution. Anyone who says ""DONT GUY THIS GAME OUTDATED GRAPHICZ SUX BUY SHOGUN OR ROME 2"" is inceccantly butthurt about losing 60 Dollars to the shitpile that is Rome 2.Buy this before you play ANY other Total War game.

												I know it says 7 minutes but I had the boxed version when I was younger and I have to say this is the STANDARD for Total War games, if not (older) strategy games. I am not saying this game is good for nostalgic reasons, I actually did enjoy this game because of how simple the map was yet how tactical the battles were, even with less units than the newer TW games. The game's map was smaller because the game is dated, and mainly for that reason I would get Rome 2 instead, because with a bigger map comes more diverse factions and units, more climate changes, and naval battles are not in this game, if I remember correctly (Though I hate them). Note: I love the city building in this game because of how many types of buildings there are, their simple and straightforward effects, and how it branches off to new things, and also I am pretty sure you can view your city in 3D, which is nice (Could be Medieval 2?)

												One of the greatest games of all times- who doesn't want to conquer the world using Pigs you can set on fire? This game, is without a doubt, one of the greatest things total war invented, the variety of nations and paths you can take leaves you almost unable to stop. Try to conquer the known world, killing the gauls, the britons, the spaniards... etc, but we can't forget the parthians and their amazing pyjama warriors ;p Once you tire the singleplayer (normally after you have dominated the world at least a dozen times) you can try your hand at defeating other players on the multiplayer. I spent so many hours of my life dragging my friends with their laptops to my house to play all v all on this game... It was essentually who was the most devious or subtle one of us who won, always a challenge to be more cunning than the next. I found the best way to success was to use troops that blended into the map... so though they could be seen, they were'nt always acknowledged by my opponents... Though I may not have many hours in this game on steam, it was through the disk that I played a good thousand of hours on...			"

												Rome Total war is a rare breed. A realistic RTS game without the chaos of real life interfering with it. Historically, this game is fairly accurate, and the Roman fighting style lends itself to more user friendly battles. And here is where the game is such a drastic improvement on the previouse titles in the series.Organised ChaosWhether it is by phalanx or testeudo, the battles are a lot more organised than its predecessors. Battles are based on your ability to organise, coordinate and react to the adversity, more than the troops at your disposal. Gone are the morale sapping archers on the hill top and heavy cavalry charge from Medieval TW2 - Rome brings you a more balanced feel to the battle, even if it is elephants vs peasants.Macro, not micro managementWhat I like most about Rome (and where they seem to have strayed from the path in more recent releases) is that these are strategy simulations, not population management games. The management evironment is simple and straight forward, the interface is both familiar and intuititve while still giving you the ability to go into more detail if those damn peasants insist on revolting every turn.Rome is a great game to either pick up and play or delve into in for days on end. Rest assured there is a battle around every corner, usually where you least suspect it.			"

												Fun game, easy mechanics, but graphics alright...(it is an ""old game"")Campaign:Starting from 272 BC from 3 Roman factions (Brutii, Juli, Scipii) You start expanding and managing Your own empire, obeying The Senates requests and missions- breaking out wars and building alliances(you can overthrow The senate ""S.P.Q.R."" when you grow stronger and turn on all Your roman allies or continue fighting with them). Defeated factions become available for a new imperial campgain, in other words- new buildings, units, strategies.The campaign map is huge: covers entire Europe(except for the Northen regions), North Africa and little of east Azia and has over 50 provinces. Rome: Total War also has historical battles where You get to decide the outcome of it(normally good commanders lead their troops to victory, these battles are to judge Your skill and leadership to win with minimum casualties)Multiplayer:Up to 8 commanders in the battlefield, players can choose between scored resolution and last man standing modes, form teams or just go ""every man for himself"" A.K.A Free For All(FFA). The host chooses the battlemap, sets rules, and it is go time!Even though R:TW is old, it's still remarkable, and offers an enjoyable gameplay. It is the fact the You get to control a full army: from hundreds up to thousands of soldiers at Your disposal! "

												There is very little to say about the amazingness of this game. So instead I will put a recipe for pancakes.\Makes: 4 to 6 servingsTime: 20 minutesIt’s amazing how quickly you can whip up this batter.  Store it, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.  Adjust the consistency of the batter with either more milk or more flour as you like. Recipe from How to Cook Everything.2 cups all-purpose flour2 teaspoons baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon sugar (optional)2 eggs11/2 to 2 cups milk2 optional tablespoons melted and cooled butter, plusunmelted butter for cooking, or use a neutral oil likegrapeseed or corn1. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat while you make the batter.2. Mix together the dry ingredients. Beat the eggs into 11/2 cups of the milk, then stir in the 2 tablespoons cooled melted butter if you’re using it. Gently stir this mixture into the dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten the flour; don’t worry about a few lumps. If the batter seems thick, add a little more milk.3. Use a little butter or oil each time you add batter, unless your skillet is truly nonstick. When the butter foam subsides or the oil shimmers, ladle batter onto the griddle or skillet, making any size pancakes you like.  Adjust the heat as necessary; usually, the first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches. The idea is to brown the bottom in 2 to 4 minutes, without burning it. Flip when bubbles appear in the center of the pancakes and the bottoms are cooked; they won’t hold together well until they’re ready.4. Cook until the second side is lightly browned, a couple more minutes, and serve or hold on an ovenproof plate in a 200°F oven for up to 15 minutes. "

												ROMANES EUNT DOMUS?!Rome: Total War is what you play when you want to tell the Romans to go home, or vice versa.It's the third game in the Total War series, and the first to introduce the gameplay template it still uses today. Gone are the 2D battlefield models and Risk-style campaign map from the first two games, replaced with 3D models and a strategic map you can use to finely position units and armies. Gameplay revolves around managing your territory in a turn-based strategy mode and moving armies around the map to fight opposing armies and capture or defend settlements in a real time tactics mode.This particular entry is widely regarded as a classic, and with great value to boot. It can certainly suffice for people who can't afford or run the later games in the series. Unfortunately the game is optimized to run on only one CPU core, so newer computers might run into some trouble anyway. As this is still only the third game in the series, there are some things in later titles that are lacking in this one such as resolutions above 1600x1400. Something to keep in mind, at least.The Gold Edition comes with the Barbarian Invasion expansion that takes place during the fall of the Roman Empire, adding new factions and some new features such as hordes & religion; well worth playing after the base game. There's also a second expansion-slash-DLC available separately that lets you play as Alexander the Great, and it's required for some of the more popular mods to run.The vanilla game is a good way to get the hang of things, but from the disorganized battle lines to the historical inaccuracy I wouldn't recommend playing for any extended period of time. To wit: the Greek city-states form one faction (just one) while Rome is divided into three gens that each get their own faction. Egypt, meanwhile, looks like it walked out of a timewarp from 1000 BC instead of the Ptolemaic empire it was at the time of Rome's ascent.There's a number of mods that overhaul the game to fix these issues and more, including (nominally) improved AI, which has always been a weakpoint of the TW series - with the exception of the first two games, which used Risk-style troop movement that's easier for AI to understand. Two of the most popular RTW mods include Rome Total Realism and Europa Barbarorum, the former being a general overhaul of the game and the latter being much more realism-focused to the point of near simulation.I'd recommend this as an entry point into Total War for people on a budget. It's probably better than Rome II at any rate; even with the many improvements that game's had since its disastrous launch it's still a game about ancient warfare that uses an engine Creative Assembly intended for Napoleonic warfare.

												To say this game is a classic is an understatement. I've been playing this for years, with the disk and on Steam, and it is still one of my favorate games I've ever played. It can beas simple as steamrolling on easy, or slugging it out on hard but this game has brought many hours of joy to my life. 8.9/10			"

												Rome Total War takes you on a journy to battlefields under the command of thousands of soldiers. Their are 20 factions. (21 if you count the rebels). Online is pretty good, only finding a game to join is a pain. In Campaign, you play as 3 roman factions and later you can play as other factions. Campaign is really hard but I keep playing anyways because of how fun it is. Their are a few things that I have to pick about this game but overall it's a must buy if your a Total War fan or not.Final verdict: 9/10			"

												 Slightly out of date now especially with its successors release. However a great introduction to the series and this edition contains a huge amount of gameplay. The graphics are quite dated given the standard of the rest of the series nowadays but still enjoyable. While they spend the next year working out all the bugs on Rome: Total War 2 I would strongly recommend getting a taste for the game through this edition by which time Rome Total War 2 will be patched enough that it will be a superlative game. In the meantime you will easily lose yourself in this game and develop a real taste for the series in general.			"

												Possibly the best TW game on the market. It may just be me viewing it through nostalgia-tinted lenses, but this game definitelly surpassed the competition in my book.Pros:- Good unit variety, building variety, and so on.- Far more colorful and vibrant than later entries.- Good variety of civilizations.- Decent dificulty curve.- Replayable to almost infinity due to variety of strategems and civilizations.- Decent modding community and re-works through dedicated websites.Cons:- Realism slightly lacking.- Some balance issues in multiplayer (barbarians lack morale, phalanx beats any other unit one-on-one etc.).- Poor diplomacy.- Community has partially moved on to Medieval II and later, meaning less mods and reworks to add replayability that    otherwise.- Graphics slightly dated.In short, the game has much to reccomend it. The main complaint I find is that the game hasn't aged well compared to others, that the graphics are out of date etc. While some have a point, the old graphics have a certain charm and don't detract from the gameplay one bit. In fact, I take that as a point in their favor as it means that older systems can run the game without frying from the effort.Buy it. You won't regret it one bit.			"

												Possibly my favourite game. I played the White Label version to death a few years ago. I was quite happy to see that they added Barbarian Invasion to this as well. Rome Total War combines a turn-based strategy world map with real time battle screen. The battles are the best part of the game so if you're more inclined to staring at maps and managing economics  I recommend looking at the Paradox games like Crusader Kings or Hearts of Iron.This game is considered one of the better in the series and the graphics aren't too bad for an eleven year old game. My favourite part of this game is the custom battles. A phalanx of Spartans vs 1000 Roman peasants, who wins?If you're not sold on the dated graphics you can always download a mod or go for one of the newer games. However Creative Assembly managed to make every entry after Medieval 2 with a new engine. Since then the releases have been a bit hit or miss. Rome 2 had an incredibly poor launch thanks to a variety of bugs and removed features.So if you want a fun strategy game I wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

												Rome: Total War is an excellent real-time strategy game. However, the most recent string of updates has caused countless problems for me and other players. The most recent update I downloaded has made the game unplayable. I cannot launch the game. I am a big Total War fan but the fact that these simple, not game-changing updates to an old, fantastic game break Rome: Total War for me makes me question what the developers are trying to achieve. I recommend buying this game in the future only when these constant updates stop.			"

												I came, I saw, I conquered!Played it since my teen years, bought and played it again. Choose a Roman family, rise in status, fight barbarians, and seize power in Rome herself. Or you could be a barbarian heathen. Easily one of my favorite games in the series and one of the best RTS games of all time. The only problem perhaps is the autoresolve battle AI seems to leave a lot to be desired. However; if you wanted a turn based game I recommend The Republic of Rome Tabletop game (playable by your lonesome but better with friends you aren't afraid to lose) or your favorite Civilization. The Historical inaccuracy of certain aspects is also fairly blatant but it is forgiven due to the game being more about cinematic sword and sandal warfare than a rough simulation of historical events for that I recommend something by Paradox Interactive.The game's strenghts lie in it's great battle system and it's fascinating overworld of intrigue. If you want a hardcore tactics game it can be that but there is also an arcade mode for people who just want to watch the sword fights but do not wish to get heavily involved in tactical movement.This is a game I could recommend for anyone with even a passing interest in this period in history. The phoenicians are waiting to meet you on the field of battle.			"

												Very good game, probably my favorite in the total war series.Pros:- Good UI makes for easy battlefield control of large armies. - Many different factions to play as with very diverse units in each. - Different campaign versions both long and short for casual or hardcore players. - Good volume of realism, armies rout and react to surprise attacks and battlefield conditions. Cons:- AI is not a very effective commander, makes for easy victories due to lack of tactical challenge against even armies. - Squalor mechanic is slightly broken meaning that cities become more rebellious despite good quality living standards. - Diplomacy is next to pointless other than for trade agreements, alliances very rarely offer any military benefits. Overall this is a great game and its only minor things that prevent this game from being perfect. I'd rate this 9.5/10			"

												I had slaughtered an army full of hoplites and by the end of the main fighting, the enemy was routing and there was just this one guy running as fast as he could go. I felt sorry for the guy, I mean, he just watched all his friends and leaders massacred in the blink of an eye and now he had 50 cavalry units about to run him down. Such is life as a hoplite10/10 would chase peasants again			"

												I hadn't played any Total War games until I bought this one. After downloading and running it I went through a tutorial that taught me how to push buttons, and then I began the campaign. I started as the great Roman house of Julli, and began my great campaign. After pushing north to the alps, driving out the Gauls, I made peace with the nearby empires. The Gauls had been raiding me on occasion, and I had always beaten them back. Things seemed to be going well, until I asked to buy a city the Gauls owned. Now, of course, I offered a fair price. It was an incredible price, in fact, but they denied it. I offered again, with even more money and goods, and again they denied. This was the last straw. How DARE they deny me?! Don't they know who WON all those wars? I then decided that I had had enough of these ancient Frenchmen who dared to think they are equal to us great Romans. I not only wanted to teach them a lesson; I wanted them gone. So thus, the Great Gaul Genocide began.It was a truly incredible campaign. Several new armies were raised. All traces of Gaul in the east were annihilated first, and a great push into the west began. Whenever I captured a city I was given the option to either occupy it as it was, enslave half the people and disperse them among my empire, or slaughter 3/4 of the people in the settlement. Naturally, I chose the latter. My goal was elimination. Death to all those barbarians who dared to have national pride. I pushed into the Gaul empire, taking city after city. The enemy had a bigger empire, perhaps, but mine was far stronger. Our great Roman soldiers killed all in their path. Despite a stumbling point where one Gaul army managed to defeat mine and save their city, two new armies took its place. The massive campaign wore on until, at last, the final Gaul stronghold fell. The people were slaughtered, and nothing remained of the once great empire.  I had kept a running body count as the genocide wore on. The final results were:Gaul Soldiers killed: 3,659Gaul Civilians killed: 33,689Total Barbarian Gauls killed (citizens and soldiers): 37,339Brave Roman soldiers lost: 1,258Final body count: 38,597 people dead. It was only after the genocide was over that I realized I'd forgotten why I was mad at them in the first place. Hmm...it was something about a city...10/10 would genocide again.			"

												Its every strategy nerds dream.This is the first Total War game i have ever played,the first few minutes i have played this game i have instantly fallen in love with it.At every corner there is a descision waiting for you to make which will/can influence the entire world in the game.The game incourages fast and descisive thinking so you better prepare for that.That isn't to say that this game has its downsides for example:Lack of naval battles,Impossible senate missions(rarely happen),AI too strong even on easy mode,boring tutorial... It is an amazing game and is a gem in the Total War collection. 8/10			"

												I grew up on this game as a child (on easy mode of course!) but it still intrigues me today! I uninstalled it a few months ago and am completely regretting it. As I type, my download bar fills tediously slow but it is completely and utterly worth it. If you are a beginner in strategy, just looking for something to play or are a pro strategist, get this game; I assure you, it is most definitely enjoyable. I based my History Exam on the Roman Empire and used the game, roughly, to plan my essay. Is that not proof enough?			"

The historical battles are a blast and some of the mods add more and even build upon pre existing historical battles such as the Battle of Tutenberg Forest from Darthmod itself Highely reccomend!

												I must begin by stating that Rome: Total War was the first and so far the only Total War game I have played.Total War is an exciting and very cerebral strategy game, that tasks you with not only rallying your troops and commanding them in battle but also governing your multiple cities along with it's inhabitants and the political relationships with other factions.The main campaign plays like a turn-based board game, where each player makes their choices and then skips, allowing others to make their moves. The objective is to take over the world.Managing your settlements is the slow paced portion of the game but still varied, as you need to satisfy your people while also recruting and positioning your military in order to accomplish your goals. You also need to be wary of what other factions feel towards you and your movements, as having allies might make a critical difference.When your troops meet other troops in the battlefield, whether it was you who attacked or your opponent is when there is the option to combat them manually. You take control of large armies, going up to to the hundreds or thousands depending or your settings. Controlling this massive number of soldiers is easy and intuitive and the variety of available units allow the combat system to provide you with multiple options. Each unit has its strenghs and purposes and the overall combination of troops you decide to take to battle make all the difference in the world.I can't recommend this game enough to any player who enjoys strategy or military games.

												I bought this then-cutting-edge game back when it was released in 2004. I'd seen it advertised some months before that on a TV series that used its engine wherein two teams competed against each other to win an historical battle. That whetted my appetite enormously. When I bought it, I not only spent countless hours playing but also played its add-ons (Barbarian Invasion and Alexander).To me Rome: Total War was the best of the Total War series - a balance between the old 2D strategy of Medieval: Total War and the increasingly eye-candy iterations that came thereafter (though I think Medieval 2: Total War was also very good).Add to this the fact that Rome has more mods than any other in that series (and with more diversity of setting/theme) and you have a game that is highly replayable. I still dip into it after 11 years of owning it! Rome forums still remain populated after all this time, and mods are still being developed for it. That speaks volumes.I've had the pleasure of being a RTW modder myself which has only added to the great joy this game has brought. Give it a go. You won't regret it.			"

												Rome Total War takes you on a journy to battlefields under the command of thousands of soldiers. Their are 20 factions. (21 if you count the rebels). Online is pretty good, only finding a game to join is a pain. In Campaign, you play as 3 roman factions and later you can play as other factions. Campaign is really hard but I keep playing anyways because of how fun it is. Their are a few things that I have to pick about this game but overall it's a must buy if your a Total War fan or not.Final verdict: 9/10			"

												I spend a majority of my strategy gaming with two games: Rome: Total War and Civilization V (I have maybe 250+ hours offline in RTW). Why do I mention this? Because I have to say that while Civ V is a better game (though not by much), I have never found a game more masterfully put together than Rome: Total War. You might be the nicest person ever, but by the end of a campaign you might as well be ranked as the world's #1 sociopath, for you will be driven to crush every rebellion and consolidate the world under the mighty grip of your imperium. The aesthetic, feel, music, all for the glory of arguably the greatest empire ever created is emulated to absolute perfection.And that's 10 YEARS after the game has been released. The most epic, enthralling, massive strategy game you'll ever get your hands on.Only issues involve possible compatibility problems. Other than that, you're paying $10 for hundreds of hours of triumphant conquest. An absolute must buy.			"

												I personally think that Rome I is better than the Rome II. Why? Despite the graphic, systems and other aspects in Rome II seems superior to Rome I, the general feeling ---glory of Roman Empire--- cannot be felt in Rome II. In Rome I, I enjoy the process of building a mighty empire from a small piece of land. And the game looks much easier to control, unlike Rome II. The music surely plays a huge part in this game that it creates sort of historical mightiness. SO that's the reason I prefer Rome I after dozens of hour experiencing.			"

I've played every total war game atleast 100+ hours on/off steam and Rome I have played almost a 800 hours or so. Nonetheless I can still enjoy playing it. It's almost 10 years old and I still think it is their best game. It is balanced and challenging and nothing compared to strategy games brougt out today.  The best thing about this game is it's strategy on both real time and turn based gameplay. This makes the game much more playable than real-time or turn-based only. It's focused around 300 BC. Around that time the romans were just about to enlarge their empire into the great roman empire which makes it fun to discover all the lost nations that they conquered. It's geography is the entire mediterian and all of germany, france, spain and the southern half of great britain.  I would definetly recommend this game if you're a fan of strategy games. It is old so don't expect much features or awesome graphics.			"

												the game is amazing. no lag, epic graphics and runs so smoothly most of the time you can compare it to the fps rate of real life.my only complaint is that on campaign mode, everything happens exactly the same all the time. the gauls attack you [or backstab you in my case because i keep allieing them] and the volcano erupts all the time at the same time all the time.but apart from that, its really addicting and fun!

												ROMANES EUNT DOMUS?!Rome: Total War is what you play when you want to tell the Romans to go home, or vice versa.It's the third game in the Total War series, and the first to introduce the gameplay template it still uses today. Gone are the 2D battlefield models and Risk-style campaign map from the first two games, replaced with 3D models and a strategic map you can use to finely position units and armies. Gameplay revolves around managing your territory in a turn-based strategy mode and moving armies around the map to fight opposing armies and capture or defend settlements in a real time tactics mode.This particular entry is widely regarded as a classic, and with great value to boot. It can certainly suffice for people who can't afford or run the later games in the series. Unfortunately the game is optimized to run on only one CPU core, so newer computers might run into some trouble anyway. As this is still only the third game in the series, there are some things in later titles that are lacking in this one such as resolutions above 1600x1400. Something to keep in mind, at least.The Gold Edition comes with the Barbarian Invasion expansion that takes place during the fall of the Roman Empire, adding new factions and some new features such as hordes & religion; well worth playing after the base game. There's also a second expansion-slash-DLC available separately that lets you play as Alexander the Great, and it's required for some of the more popular mods to run.The vanilla game is a good way to get the hang of things, but from the disorganized battle lines to the historical inaccuracy I wouldn't recommend playing for any extended period of time. To wit: the Greek city-states form one faction (just one) while Rome is divided into three gens that each get their own faction. Egypt, meanwhile, looks like it walked out of a timewarp from 1000 BC instead of the Ptolemaic empire it was at the time of Rome's ascent.There's a number of mods that overhaul the game to fix these issues and more, including (nominally) improved AI, which has always been a weakpoint of the TW series - with the exception of the first two games, which used Risk-style troop movement that's easier for AI to understand. Two of the most popular RTW mods include Rome Total Realism and Europa Barbarorum, the former being a general overhaul of the game and the latter being much more realism-focused to the point of near simulation.I'd recommend this as an entry point into Total War for people on a budget. It's probably better than Rome II at any rate; even with the many improvements that game's had since its disastrous launch it's still a game about ancient warfare that uses an engine Creative Assembly intended for Napoleonic warfare.

												Rome has still its own personality among Total War series: its still nice to play it after the next ones of the series. Its main problem in my opinion is these powerful units with more than one ""life point"" like general units for example that make it unrealistic for this part and tough to counter. Another problem is the use of gamespy for multi battles, that sometimes show an error when you try to join a hosted game. Else the game in multi give to host more settings to manage than in next games since Empire, giving more the ability to have the battle the host wish without using rules among players, even if these rules are still used in some case, like clan war belt (cwb) rules.

												Where do I begin? The soothing music is soothing, the epic battles are epic. The Syrians are the Syrians, sadly Scotia does not feature.I recommend to start as the Julii, the Gauls are a relatively easy opponent, and they fly the well-known Roman Red colour. The Brutii are fun, but you're up against tougher opposition, in the form of Pontus...Feckin' Pontus... But, the Scipii, in my opinion are the hardest. Lemme explain: Your main enemy is Carthage, they have War Elephants, you'll also be mainly situated in the North African desert, Arid climate does not help trade or pop growth.Anyway, 10/10 Game, one of my favorites, i may even prefer it over Med II Total War.

												Never bothered with Total War games. Then I decided to pick up a copy of Rome 2 to see why everyone was getting massive hard ons about it. I thought that was great and all but I wanted to try the other games.MY GOD! THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN MISSING OUT ON!? Sure the graphics and animations are 10 years old but the game itself has so much to offer. It even has my favourite period of history: West and East Roman Empires, this is much more challenging, complex, and tactical than Rome 2, even its soundtrack is better. This requries actual skill to succeed, you really need to think of the consquences of your actions and its effects on your empire.Despite its age, Rome has easily become my second favourite RTS (Wargame comes first) I know I will be playing this more than Rome 2. I still can't get over the fact that I didn't get this eariler, I have a lot of catching up to do on the other Total War titles.			"

												I must begin by stating that Rome: Total War was the first and so far the only Total War game I have played.Total War is an exciting and very cerebral strategy game, that tasks you with not only rallying your troops and commanding them in battle but also governing your multiple cities along with it's inhabitants and the political relationships with other factions.The main campaign plays like a turn-based board game, where each player makes their choices and then skips, allowing others to make their moves. The objective is to take over the world.Managing your settlements is the slow paced portion of the game but still varied, as you need to satisfy your people while also recruting and positioning your military in order to accomplish your goals. You also need to be wary of what other factions feel towards you and your movements, as having allies might make a critical difference.When your troops meet other troops in the battlefield, whether it was you who attacked or your opponent is when there is the option to combat them manually. You take control of large armies, going up to to the hundreds or thousands depending or your settings. Controlling this massive number of soldiers is easy and intuitive and the variety of available units allow the combat system to provide you with multiple options. Each unit has its strenghs and purposes and the overall combination of troops you decide to take to battle make all the difference in the world.I can't recommend this game enough to any player who enjoys strategy or military games.

												This game hits right on the target for RTS games. It has a turn based campaign in which you create massive armies and manage settlements. Then when two armies collide (whether that be an seige or field battle) the real fun begins you can play battles with thousands of soldiers slugging it out. The different factions have huge differences in which you have to play. Romans have superb heavy infantry which can tackle most other infantry but lack cavalry. The Greeks have phalanx that buckle down enemy infantry so your cavalry can finish the job. And the barbarian have cool unique units like the druids and fanatics. This game is very polished and is better than all the other games in the series and i have played all but the first two (rome 2 is on my other account). Me and my friend love playing battles (even though he spams phants and  sacred band). I would recommend this game to anyone who plays RTS!			"

												One of, if not the best strategy game ever created. Certainly the best in the total war series in my books.Rome excels with top notch gameplay and a smooth clear crisp battle engine. Certainly Rome Total War came out in 2005 so graphically comparing to modern titles it is inferior, however it runs and plays so much better as a game vs other total war games. Rome is like a no frills strategy game, no crap, no bulsht, an amazing game which loads of replay value- as it should be!I have probably spent more time playing Rome Total War than any other game. At it's current steam price around £1.60 it is a steal. Buy it, there are still plenty of folks online.			"

												Simply the best Total War game ever made. If you don't believe me check out Time Commanders a television show from the BBC hosted by the one and only Richard Hammond (also from Top Gear) where people play as generals trying to gain victory in a historical battle.Anyways, game mechanics is far more superb than the newer instalation of Rome 2. Graphical wise outdated ofcourse. But that won't stop anyone from playing a good game.PS: I don't have a big record of game time on steam simply because I played this from the orginal CD-ROM... I just bought the total war humble bundle collection.			"

Seriously if your a fan of the RTS genre or history or heck both you owe it to your self to pick this game up.         Glory to Rome!!!			"

												I spend a majority of my strategy gaming with two games: Rome: Total War and Civilization V (I have maybe 250+ hours offline in RTW). Why do I mention this? Because I have to say that while Civ V is a better game (though not by much), I have never found a game more masterfully put together than Rome: Total War. You might be the nicest person ever, but by the end of a campaign you might as well be ranked as the world's #1 sociopath, for you will be driven to crush every rebellion and consolidate the world under the mighty grip of your imperium. The aesthetic, feel, music, all for the glory of arguably the greatest empire ever created is emulated to absolute perfection.And that's 10 YEARS after the game has been released. The most epic, enthralling, massive strategy game you'll ever get your hands on.Only issues involve possible compatibility problems. Other than that, you're paying $10 for hundreds of hours of triumphant conquest. An absolute must buy.			"

												Never bothered with Total War games. Then I decided to pick up a copy of Rome 2 to see why everyone was getting massive hard ons about it. I thought that was great and all but I wanted to try the other games.MY GOD! THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN MISSING OUT ON!? Sure the graphics and animations are 10 years old but the game itself has so much to offer. It even has my favourite period of history: West and East Roman Empires, this is much more challenging, complex, and tactical than Rome 2, even its soundtrack is better. This requries actual skill to succeed, you really need to think of the consquences of your actions and its effects on your empire.Despite its age, Rome has easily become my second favourite RTS (Wargame comes first) I know I will be playing this more than Rome 2. I still can't get over the fact that I didn't get this eariler, I have a lot of catching up to do on the other Total War titles.			"

												This game is on my Top 5 Games of All Time List.Let's start with the presentation. This Games graphics are out dated, but the attention to detail and polish are abundant. Nothing was more satisfying then watching my cavalry charge send individual men flying. The world map is kind of bland, but you have a pretty good idea of what the terrain is. All of the cities are (or were) real cities, and many you may already know of. This game is a very well researched game. There are many historical troop types and landmarks. I can't even imagine how much time was put in to making this game as historically accurate as possible.Overall, this is a well-presented game.Now let's look at gameplay. This games battle system is hands down the best I have seen in any RTS ever. The attention to detail is astounding. Certain troops counter others, this is in other games. However, different formations and tactics can turn the tables on your so-called counters. You can be a regular Cesar if you play your cards right. The AI is not the sharpest tool in the shed, especially when it comes to troop movement. I have missed a table-turning oppurtunity in many a battle due to a units slow response or incorrect followthrough of an order. It could be said that this makes the game more realistic, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. The game can be played in single or multiplayer player mode. Single player has three functions: Campaign, Custom battles, and Historical battles. The Campaign can be played as one of the three Roman factions at first and later other factions. Not every faction can be played as-at least not in th vanilla-which is a shame as many unique factions were left out. The campaign takes place over a world map as you and the other factions take turns building and managing an empire. The campaign is extremely immersive. Players personalities are reflected in how they play the game. I can be impatient, but I also am a procrastinator. As a result, I would impatiently blitz one enemy, then stand around repelling the attacks of another. The goals of the game are dependent on what type of campaign tou chose. A short one has small goals while a long one has large. Overall the campaign is the best part of the game. The custom battle option is fun for experimenting with new tactics or just goofing around. It is not something you will spend a ton of time on though. The Historical battles are just that, battles from history. They put you in the shoes of real ancient commanders in battles that actually took place. They're fun, but not very replayable. The multiplayer is the second best function of the game. It allows you to play online in battles with other players. The type of battles vary, from sieges to free-for-alls. There are even some historical battles exclusive to multiplayer. Overall, the multiplayer is great for when you want a change of pace.Over all, this game has a good presentation, pays attention to detail, and is highly immersive, the best ten bucks you'll ever spend. 9.5/10 "

												I definetly loved this game. It was revolutionary at the time and is still considered one of the best total wars to date. It is mostly balanced and when it's not it's usually just the overpricing of certain units. The community is full of skilled players which is a pro and a con. Many players may struggle to get into the game because of that fact, but if you practice enough and look up some strategy guides then you can rek face. I felt that no army was super under-powered or super over-powered and that anyone could be good with any faction. Now I'm going to talk a bit more about the cons. One of my major cons is that some factions do not get that many units. In campaign this may be OK but in multiplayer it can make some factions harder to play as. Next con is, well it's old. I'm not complaining about graphics, I'm more complaining about limitations. Battles above five thousand are laggy and hard to play. Also the campaign is hard if you don't look up even one strategy guide. It's confusing and sometimes you feel like you don't know what to do. They give you some tips that aren't neccessarily helpful. I remember having to restart the game as the brutii often because it's that hard. You can end up having built up a large debt. And my final complaint is diplomacy. Oh god the diplomacy. The diplomacy is awful. I remember gaul asking me for trade rights, me accepting, and then they attack me. Also, I have a friend who was attacking the last city of dacia. Dacia had a ton of money and he had accept or we will attack, in exchange for ten thousand denarii. Dacia refused and got obliterated. Stingy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Also, Gaul in my most recent Brutii playthrough said ""give us 500 denarii or we will attack"" and I just gave it to them. Keep in mind that the julii is currently making them their ♥♥♥♥♥. Then I was like, ""Hey, want map information? Just give us 10,000 denarii."" Gaul counter offered with ""Give us 550 denarii every turn for two turns or we'll attack."" and I was like ""♥♥♥♥ you!"" and then Gaul went to go threaten the rest of rome. Bare in mind that they haven't attacked yet.My final score is 9/10 for the game. It struggles a bit, but for the time it was made it was amazing.			"

												Rome: Total War is an excellent real-time strategy game. However, the most recent string of updates has caused countless problems for me and other players. The most recent update I downloaded has made the game unplayable. I cannot launch the game. I am a big Total War fan but the fact that these simple, not game-changing updates to an old, fantastic game break Rome: Total War for me makes me question what the developers are trying to achieve. I recommend buying this game in the future only when these constant updates stop.			"

												Possibly my favourite game. I played the White Label version to death a few years ago. I was quite happy to see that they added Barbarian Invasion to this as well. Rome Total War combines a turn-based strategy world map with real time battle screen. The battles are the best part of the game so if you're more inclined to staring at maps and managing economics  I recommend looking at the Paradox games like Crusader Kings or Hearts of Iron.This game is considered one of the better in the series and the graphics aren't too bad for an eleven year old game. My favourite part of this game is the custom battles. A phalanx of Spartans vs 1000 Roman peasants, who wins?If you're not sold on the dated graphics you can always download a mod or go for one of the newer games. However Creative Assembly managed to make every entry after Medieval 2 with a new engine. Since then the releases have been a bit hit or miss. Rome 2 had an incredibly poor launch thanks to a variety of bugs and removed features.So if you want a fun strategy game I wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

												Rome: Total War is an excellent game. It allows you to take control of one of the three houses of rome (And other civs as well later) and pits you against others, you have to get your leaders into senates, conduct trade deals and manage provinces. You also have to manage the affairs of your family, whether or not your daughter will marry so and so, and if one of them dies of old age. It's a horrible feeling, that, especially when it's your leader who dies, and you are left lost, trying to find a Heir for when it happens again, moving your main body of the army under someone elses control. The battles are realistic, your men sometimes disobeying you, and having emotions of their own. If you are losing, they may run away, elephants and wolves will also freak them out. Sometimes one or two men will even disobey one of your orders, getting themselves killed, every loss you take is something you actually feel, as you must keep your army maintained and happy, keep your cities from rioting. It is not, however, impossible to play. I am doing it an injustice with how hard I am making it sound, it is truly an amazing game, and earns a good 9/10.			"

Therefore this is an interesting alternative to Rome II or any more recent Total War title if your computer sucks, if you're poor, or if you just don't like their new engine (I don't).

												This is one of the greatest games of it's kind. It's a little aged, but has aged awesomely well. If you have even the slightest appreciation for war/strategy games, this one must be in your collection! Just watch it, because you might find yourself spending too many hours in front of this one, as I do from time to time. Can't get enough!			"

												I love this game because of the rich time period, and the battles, but their is some draw backs to playing this game. the AI is not very smart, sometimes when you give them a order and they will go another direction or take a long way to their destionation. Another drawback is that the graphics are really bad, but this is a good game, epic real time battles, make your own historical battles, as you play as the mighty romens, or lead the life as hannible great millitary leader carthage. it a perfect game and this really brings a fun and chess like stragedy for winning battles.

												Rome is a solid game The campaign is enjouuyable and hacking your way through the barbarians with your heavily armed infantry is wonderful. Yet by the end of the campaign you still get a challanging opponent in the form of the other Romans. The only qualm I have with the game is the multiplayer. The system (at least for me) is inoperable. Which unfortunatly means I can't enjoy the game to it's full potential.			"

I've been playing this game for years now, and even though RTW2 is already out (which I play as well) this game is just awesome. I barely get bored of playing it. So buy it!P.S. One little thing I dislike: The pathfinding of your units can be very stupid sometimes.

												Revolutionary when it came out, this game has become a bit dated for its genre. I'd recommend it only if you LOVE Rome as I do. Another thing I'll say for R:TW is that it's got some pretty varied factions and environments. Still, when I first played .... Let's just say there's something enchanting about building up the greatest empire in history and seeing yourself slowly expand into Britain and Africa and whatnot. :) Waiting for Rome II.			"

Bought on steam for 3 dollarsJoin 2v2 with friendFriend wants to play as barbariansI refuse; a true roman would join the legionWe play as rome v barbariansHe brings a balanced force including war machines and skirmishersI bring a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of legionary cohortsI also point up a maxed out praetorian cohort; it costs more than 3 legionary cohortsIs it cost effective? I assume not. Yolo, I bring it anywaysDuring deployment we start at opposite ends of our sideWe accidentally start the battle early; we have not consolidated our forcesThe barbarians deploy about 2/3 of their forces opposite me with a blocking force against my teammateMy unsupported legionnaires are being overrun by the barbarian hordesMy teammate is bulldozing through the blocking force opposing him and rushing to my aidCan I survive long enough?I decide to commit my reserve - the praetorians - to sacrifice their lives for timePRAETORIANS, HOLD THE LINE AS LONG AS NECESSARY!The praetorians are having none of thisThey singlehandedly stabilize my lineBy the end of the battle over 900 of my 1500 men will be dead. Many others will have retreatedOnly 4 of 80 praetorians will dieThe literal last act of the battle was the infantry praetorians chasing down a mounted barbarian warlord and chopping him upI mouse over their status before the battle ends - they have been fighting about 2/3 of the battle, and charging up and down the field. Most of my other units are badly mauled, have low morale, and are exhausted“eager, warmed up, motivated by presence of general”ROMA VICTOR 10/10 would slaughter barbarians for the glory of rome again "

												Rome: Total War is by far one of the greatest games of all time. I have been playing it since 2012 and could say without a doubt that this is on my top 10. There is one very interesting thing about this game though. I have seen nothing make an army of over 2000 run faster than 152 Beserkers and 1 General. No kidding here. I main germany and build armies solely based off of 4-5 Beserkers and 1 Screeching Women for skirmishes. I have chased down 2 Armies (One was around 2800 and the other was 2500) and won because they fled the battlefield. I love this game.			"

												This is still the best Total War game uit here. It is not CPU nor GPU intensive so anyone can run it, and it has by far the best strategic option. I really recommend Darth Mod V9.0.1 as the map size is almost doubled! Rome has very good unit, but i think that the Spartans are the strongest (rightfull, thouh) This game is certainly worth 4€ and if you worry about graphics, they aren't great for sure, but perfect for the genre and not too intensive so playable for more people than ROME II. I recommend this version above Total War Rome II.			"

												R:TW is a great strategy game, a grand strategy from the classics. It's pretty sophisticated for it's time, but since we have other strategy games, this is just a cakewalk, that is, if you're a stategist.Rome Total War ♥♥♥♥♥slaps Rome Total War 2, reason is, they completely released an unfinished game. Rome Total War was perfect, now they're just milking it of Rome Total War 2, anyways.Goodies:Rome Total War has amazing features, great units and other things. It takes the definition of strategy and slaps it right into your face. Now as you can see, my hours aren't any compared to others, (90% of the time I was rekting skrubs on multiplayer.)This is an amazing game, a real classic, if you had anyone that played this on it's release (me), it's a ♥♥♥♥ing classic game compared to the modern ones. It's great build kept me glued to it for hours on the box set back in 2006, and was a real game changer and introduction to strategy, like Europa Universalis, it's a great series, but it's ""new"" and ""improved"" games of 2013-2015 are killing it.Bad:There's a few glitches, and it tends to get boring if you don't find the.. -uhm- ""right"" scenario, skirmish, etc. to do.9.4/10Reason why: Classic game, amazing graphics for it's time, all-around great historical precision. Just a few annoying glitches like invincible Gauls. (Those that can take 500+ arrows surrounded by archers, and walk away with no damaged soldiers)			"

												Rome Total War was the first game that I was ever obsessed with, being early in high school when it came out in 2004. I actually first saw the game engine on the History Channel’s show Decisive Battles, which used the game to depict the Battle of Cannae, among others.The slaughter that can be witnessed and commanded on the RTS battlefield in this game came at a pivotal time, when Lord of the Rings rewrote the book on grand fantasy movies. You saw these huge battles on screen in movies, and now you could command them yourself.From experience the central mechanics of a game obviously must grab you to hold interest, but I also believe that the little details can be just as important in showing the player how much the developers love their work. Those that struck me in this game were the hilarious descriptions and attributes of the generals, which adds flesh to the polygons you command. Here you could find that your general could be a bold Caesar, or an insane Caligula (literally one of the attributes can describe a character as painting his butt blue and running around the palace naked). These attributes can affect what your generals say in their speeches before a battle; I would always make insane generals my frontline commanders, just so I could hear them say ridiculous things before a battle. The game is fun, has plenty charm, and an epic soundtrack; still plenty of bugs, but they can be worked around. Try roleplaying your generals in battle, and your faction leader in the campaign map based upon their respective attributes.			"

												Good, ol' (10 year old to be exact) Total War, strategy.   Graphics look like they were designed in 2004... In case you were wondering, this game was released September 22, 2004.   Gameplay is awesome. That is what makes, Rome: Total War, so fun! The strategy system in this game is awesome. So many cool details to this game.   Preformance... well, assuming that you don't use any software made before Windows 2000 (I think I can safely make this assumption) this game runs perfectly.   The sound of this game is great. Very lively and realistic.   Controls are standard, no controller support.   Playtime? Well, that is up to you. If you get bored of strategy easily, you won't last over 10 hours, but if you like strategy, you'll play through the campaign a few times and play with your friends (15+ Hours)   Personally, I love this game, despite NOT being a lover of all things strategy related. Get this game, on sale, or not.			"

												wow 2015..... already and still playing this game as if it was brand new out of that cd-case back in 20048-9 YEARS!I got this from steam with money I got from selling items off in the steam market place, from pure dedication and love for it, Conclusion is if you love telling tiny men what to do and have cities more roudy than the london riots and don't want to get get (or can't) get rome total war 2 then it is certain that exchanging hard earned dollars for this game would probably be a good exchange of cash.9.8/10The only issues I have is that the AI can go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes and not focus their attention on your when your invading their lands (happened only about 15 - 22+ times over the span of 8 - 9 years)			"

												Rome: Total War is by far one of the greatest games of all time. I have been playing it since 2012 and could say without a doubt that this is on my top 10. There is one very interesting thing about this game though. I have seen nothing make an army of over 2000 run faster than 152 Beserkers and 1 General. No kidding here. I main germany and build armies solely based off of 4-5 Beserkers and 1 Screeching Women for skirmishes. I have chased down 2 Armies (One was around 2800 and the other was 2500) and won because they fled the battlefield. I love this game.			"

												Rome: Total War is a great game. You know this game came out in 2004 and twelve years later this game managed to heavily impress me. From the small part of diplomatic relations to the absolute massive battle scenes, the game just immediately sucked me in. Now the Total War games had never really been a big thing to me up until this moment so I was just a bit dubious about how much this game would appeal to me, but I am a history buff and I was trying to find a way to spend the summer so I picked it up during the sale. What I found was an actually really good game that managed to combine the turn base parts with the real time strategy. The game as said is split into two types of strategy. The first part is map screen. From here you manage your settlements and your armies. You can upgrade your towns and recruit new units. From here you can also send out your diplomats to other factions in order to institute trade agreements and forge alliances for wars. The diplomats have actually quite a bit that they can discuss with the other factions. You can make demands such has making them hand over a territory or you can create a trade agreement that can help your income or just allow them military access to other parts of the world. Another thing that impressed me is that they can reject your offer and make counter offers. This really does feel like an actual negotiation rather than just a basic “I declare peace or war thing.” One thing I’m going to say though is that there is a severe problem with the lack of anything to really during peace time. In the end though the map screen is fantastic turn based strategy. Now as for the actual battle screens it is one the greatest parts of the game. The sieges and the battles are just so massive that it is impossible to be swept away by it. The fights aren’t too complicated. It doesn’t take long to figure the strengths and weaknesses and of each unit. Just know when to charge and how to flank the enemy and that’s rather easy to pick up. What makes it really work though is just the basic ability to pause the game and figure out your positions and where each unit should go. This takes a lot the panicking and stress out of other strategies that usually takes me out of most strategy games. The units are widely varied and it is rather cool to see the progress of your units to much more powerful troops.In the end what really sells the game is just the absolute scale it has. The game just feels massive and every advancement you do makes you feel more powerful. Some might say that the effects don’t look good and to those people I say they need to shut it. The game looked amazing back in the day and still looks line today. I don’t care if we can’t see every pimple on the soldiers they look fine. As for the multiplayer I don’t know what it’s like. I am not interested in it, but if you are then check it out. Rome: Total War is a game that everyone should check out if you are interested in history or if you think you might be interested in the game.  "

												This is still the best Total War game uit here. It is not CPU nor GPU intensive so anyone can run it, and it has by far the best strategic option. I really recommend Darth Mod V9.0.1 as the map size is almost doubled! Rome has very good unit, but i think that the Spartans are the strongest (rightfull, thouh) This game is certainly worth 4€ and if you worry about graphics, they aren't great for sure, but perfect for the genre and not too intensive so playable for more people than ROME II. I recommend this version above Total War Rome II.			"

												Haven’t played this since it was sold on CD. Bought on steam for 3 dollarsJoin 2v2 with friendFriend wants to play as barbariansI refuse; a true roman would join the legionWe play as rome v barbariansHe brings a balanced force including war machines and skirmishersI bring a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of legionary cohortsI also point up a maxed out praetorian cohort; it costs more than 3 legionary cohortsIs it cost effective? I assume not. Yolo, I bring it anywaysDuring deployment we start at opposite ends of our sideWe accidentally start the battle early; we have not consolidated our forcesThe barbarians deploy about 2/3 of their forces opposite me with a blocking force against my teammateMy unsupported legionnaires are being overrun by the barbarian hordesMy teammate is bulldozing through the blocking force opposing him and rushing to my aidCan I survive long enough?I decide to commit my reserve - the praetorians - to sacrifice their lives for timePRAETORIANS, HOLD THE LINE AS LONG AS NECESSARY!The praetorians are having none of thisThey singlehandedly stabilize my lineBy the end of the battle over 900 of my 1500 men will be dead. Many others will have retreatedOnly 4 of 80 praetorians will dieThe literal last act of the battle was the infantry praetorians chasing down a mounted barbarian warlord and chopping him upI mouse over their status before the battle ends - they have been fighting about 2/3 of the battle, and charging up and down the field. Most of my other units are badly mauled, have low morale, and are exhausted“eager, warmed up, motivated by presence of general”ROMA VICTOR 10/10 would slaughter barbarians for the glory of rome again "

												The best of Total War series and an example of what strategy games should be.There have been tons and tons of mods made since the game was released. I recommend my personal favorite Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥ II mod to be installed as soon as you are done with the original game. It expands the original Rome: Total War experience a lot and really challenges the player. And remember this above all: our Roman gods are watching! Make sure they are not ashamed!			"

												Having played the Total War series since the original Shogun, including the newer installments, Rome: Total War still stands as the one I believe is best.The graphics are certainly a bit dated, but even then they aren't horrible. The gameplay however is where this game really stood apart. The factions felt much more significant than a lot of the other games, while also not feeling TOO different, so it feels like you're fighting on equal terms more or less. Got a choice of quite a lot of factions, but the map itself isn't overloaded with different forces, and you're able to play all of them yourself once unlocking them, something they stopped allowing in later installments.Then one thing that I really like in this game, which I believe only showed up in Rome and Medieval 2 is the idea that your Captains (the leader of armies without Generals) can actually be adopted into your family and made a full on General for their accomplishments. Such a nice feature, as if you have an army going around and doing really well, that Captain deserves recognition. In general I liked the family tree system as well. Medieval 2 had a lot of this, but I felt got too bogged down by the religion system, whereas Rome has no such drawbacks to me.Overall I'd rate this game very highly, especially if you enjoy the Total War series. Bought it on Steam just so I wouldn't need to keep breaking out my old disc to play it, which is why the relatively low playtime.			"

												Where to begin...Total War series, never a letdown but for some reason: this game's stability on Windows 7 has decreased horribly with updates. Even LESS optimized. PC is a Win7-64bit with all the bells and whistles and up-to-date drivers but yet the performance of the game stutters and suffers after about an hour in play to where it takes about 20 seconds to click a menu button. Googling some updates or at least some methods to try to solve this problem...no results. I'm honestly disappointed at how badly optimized this game is for Win7. Your experience may vary.Good - Total War series. Everything you ever wanted to be the ruler of Rome and pounding barbarians into dust while bowing to the Senate.-Unit scale is ridiculously well imagined and with proper planning - you can have some pretty large battles.-All the mods you could shake a stick at in Workshop or mod communities.-Replay value for each race/city is phenomenal.Bad- Badly optimized for Win7- Random stutters and crash-to-black. Save often.- With no balance mods, it's pretty easy for the micromanage to get out of hand to where you need to hire and fire peasants to transfer population from one city to another. Do your reading and listen to the advice on how to manage LARGE cities.Oldie but good but buyer beware. Be prepared to suffer a bit. "

												Rome: Total War was and still is THE gold standard for round-based strategy games.Indeed the AI can be classified as stupid, at best, but that's a disadvantage all the Total War games are suffering from. Yet, the game always manages to provide a thorough and fun experience.I would like to recommend installing the popular addition called ""Darthmod: Rome"", which will dramatically improve the map size, the gameplay and the campaign as a whole.Carpe diem!

												*WARNING : LONG (But detailed) REVIEWWhere to start with Rome Total War? This game is like Sid Meier’s Civilization but more focused on , as the title would suggest , Total War. So, enough beating around the bush.ProsThis game is absolute genius. Its historically accurate , apart from the part when you , the player , take 100 percent of the area near Rome. The game notifies you when something like a flood or the Pompeii eruption occurs around the same time (I have no clue if Pompeii makes an appearance in the game. I've never gotten far enough). Another great part are the wars. There are , I believe , 3 types of fighting : Army to Army , Army to Town or City , and Fleet to Fleet. Army to Army is a standard type of fighting. Two armies on opposite sides of a field where there will be a fight to the death. This is challenging for me due to all the open space but to others it may be easier. Army to Town or City is where an army is trying to take a town or city by either maintaining a successful siege , starving the enemies inside, or forcefully invading by making Siege Towers , Ladders , Rams , and / or other breaching equipment. Either way , If successful , the army and their faction will then take and rule the captured city. Technically this is a con but , Fleet to Fleet is just borderline impossible , at least for me. In this type of battle, two fleets fight each other on the unrelenting sea. This can be especially dangerous if your ship attacked is a transport ship carrying YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST TROOPS. If this transport ship loses the battle , every man aboard will die. However , there is a fantastic feeling when you successfully take down an army , general , town , or even 1 of 20 factions. ConsThis game is anything but perfect. For starters , the battle screen. Before each battle , a screen pops up describing the soon starting skirmish along with 3 buttons : Flee and Retreat , Auto Resolve Battle , or Go to Battle Screen and fight the enemy yourself. Tip : Pick Auto Resolve. Fleeing is for Benito Mussolini and good luck trying to figure out the Battle Screen controls. The camera is awful. If you want to move the camera right there is a chance that you could end up looking at the ground. Along with that , you cant simply tell your archers to fire on an enemy. There's this whole process of moving them into position and it's just not worth it. Using a faulty controller to play Mortal Kombat while making a space station in Kerbal Space Program with your toes is easier than taking on an army. Its hard to explain but don't fight in the battles. Another con is the fact that the game goes through almost phases. One minute you have more generals than any other faction with more gold than Scrooge McDuck and another you are losing towns to rebels because of dying Governors without enough cash to fight back , let alone buy half a particle of dirt. This second phase is the main reason I can't get a single faction. The game gives you about 255 years to conquer all factions but even Alexander the Great couldn't win.SummaryChallenge - 8/10Replayability - 8/10Battles - 6/10Price - Rome Total War - Worth It           Rome Total War Collection - Yes if Previous Fan           Rome Total War Master Collection - Nope           Rome Total War Grand Master Collection - Not even if you are Bill GatesVerdict - Buy			"

PROS:+ huge campaign map+ a LOT of various factions available to play+ fun & tactical gameplay+ interesting units+ town upgrades & logistics+ TONS of cool mods+ ancient times atmosphere+ Barbarian Invasion expansion includedCONS:- a bit outdated graphics- wonky diplomacy system against AI- the rebel armies appear too often- weaker multiplayerComment:I finally bought this game here on Steam so I would have a digital copy of it as my discs are getting really old. This game is worth purchasing because it is a phenomenal RTS game and a must-have part of the Total War series. The graphics have aged but the game still looks decent and let us face it - the game has always been about gameplay first. Multiplayer is fun but the single-player campaign is what this game excels at. A huge map with three roman factions to choose from initially, later each defeated nation is unlocked as playable in the campaign. The gameplay is divided into 3 parts - cities management, sea battles and land battles. The last one is what this game is about and what makes it truly great. All the units, even siege engines, are nicely done and serve a purpose. The fighting is tactical and fair, although sometimes hard. But nothing beats the feeling of  a victory when you are outnumbered 4 to 1, or more! The AI has some problems but that can be forgiven in this case because it does not break the game at all. On top of all this are the mods, the lovely awesome mods. There are so many it would be hard to write all the good ones but MY personal favourites are Europa Babarorum, Lord of the Rings - Total War & Rome Total Realism. Seriously this game is worth your money if you like RTS games so I quite happily recommend it!			"

												Rome Total War is the best in the Total war series and even ranks amoug the top games of all time.  I consider it the second best RTS of all time, only following AOE2. Playing massive battle where you can go head first in frontline action is absolutly mesmorising. Anyone can play Rome Total War but it takes a pro to be good. You need to perfect tactics and have to know the ins and outs of each map. This game stands the test of time beaytifully, If your invading a citadel or recreating Thermopylae you are always having a great time because Rome total War, no mater how many times you have played it, always bring a new scenario to the table, something you didn't expect. I believe Rome Total War will always have a loyal fanbase that will constantly find new and improved tactics. Each map is masterfully constructed with amazing attention to detail, for example you can....-invade towns, cities, and giant citidels-recreate battles of the past on a massive scale-Play multiplayer with friends (my favorite style)-Make a battle of your own-Quick play for a quick and fun battle-the campaign (This is unplayed by many, I have never heard someone say, boy, i could go for some Rome Total War campaign)These styles and many more is what makes Rome Total War so memorible and fun. If your playing with friends or, playing alone Rome Total War is always incredibly entertaining.			"

I caught onto the total war series a little late in my gaming career, yet, they all have the same staying power of each other.Rome: Total War is one of the most iconic in the series and widely regarded as the turning point for the franchise, boosting the already formidable number of titles that were available. In the game you are able to take control of one of the historically correct houses: Julii, Brutii, and Scipi - each as advantages over one another with faction specific attributes. You get to start off with a few generations within the house and begin to build you empire in an attempt to control all 15 other factions. I preferred this to Rome: Total War 2 – which I felt lacked the diplomacy and hierarchy incentives of the first game, it made the experience much more interesting and personal. The game is a great place to start for players new to the franchise, the GFX are a little dated now but you will easily see past it within the first 2 hours as you start to assemble an army. I would recommend trying this out if you’re tentative as it’s quite cheap now and can likely be picked up in a bundle at some point.  "

												Rome Total War is the best in the Total war series and even ranks amoug the top games of all time.  I consider it the second best RTS of all time, only following AOE2. Playing massive battle where you can go head first in frontline action is absolutly mesmorising. Anyone can play Rome Total War but it takes a pro to be good. You need to perfect tactics and have to know the ins and outs of each map. This game stands the test of time beaytifully, If your invading a citadel or recreating Thermopylae you are always having a great time because Rome total War, no mater how many times you have played it, always bring a new scenario to the table, something you didn't expect. I believe Rome Total War will always have a loyal fanbase that will constantly find new and improved tactics. Each map is masterfully constructed with amazing attention to detail, for example you can....-invade towns, cities, and giant citidels-recreate battles of the past on a massive scale-Play multiplayer with friends (my favorite style)-Make a battle of your own-Quick play for a quick and fun battle-the campaign (This is unplayed by many, I have never heard someone say, boy, i could go for some Rome Total War campaign)These styles and many more is what makes Rome Total War so memorible and fun. If your playing with friends or, playing alone Rome Total War is always incredibly entertaining.			"

												Rome: Total War is beginning to show its age, but even 10 years after release it is still one of the best strategy games set in ancient Rome, and is probably the closest one can come to conquering and ruling the known world as a Roman emperor. Large-scale battles, spectacular sieges, trade, diplomacy, assassination - Rome has it all. The greatest, and possibly only, weakness is the dumb AI, which has trouble applying any tactics outside of a head-on assault.			"

												Rome Total War A great game despite it's age.Graphics 4 of 10It's a really old game and the first total war game with 3D units instead of animated 2D sprites so you can't expect much in the way of graphics. and what you expect is what you get.Learning curve (the lower the number the less learning curve there is) 5 of 10The tutorials are good and the game is fairly simple to get into. This game has some learning curve for those who have never played any other RTSes but for those who have played other RTSes before they will have no problem getting into this game's controls.Gameplay (on the battlefield) 7.5 of 10Pros.+Siege battles are very fun and challenging without being too hard.+Land battles are Fun and tactical without being too hard.+The AI is very good for a game of this age and can keep up with human opponents.Cons-some units are a bit over-powered such as elephants.-some units are completely worthless unless under very specific circumstances such as the incendiary pigs that are only effective against elephants and have a tendency to kill more of your own people then the enemy’s that are killed due to the attack.and they do the same thing that a barrage of fire arrows from your archers could do.Overall the land battles are very fun to play and are even better if you can find a human opponent to play with (CA recently migrated this game to steam due to the gamespy shutdown.)Gameplay (Grand campaign) 4.5 of 10Pros. +can be very fun when everything works well in tandem.Cons-Very dated-It is nigh imposable to keep your budget in check when at war.-diplomacy is clunky-auto-resolving battles tends to end with your army losing a battle that anyone could win when controlling the units themselves.Overall the campaign is good at times and really bad at others.Overall 7 of 10.Rome Total War is a game of two qualities; on one hand the battles are great and fun to command, on the other side the campaign is clunky, and not all that great at all. The good does outweigh the bad however. I completely recommend this game as custom and historical battles circumvent the horrid campaign and go to what is great about Rome Total War the combat.			"

												I had played this game before picking it up on Steam and in the end I decided to do it through here as well, as I kinda miss it, I only had the base game, and it was stupidly cheap. As I usually do, I'm gonna start sharing what the game does wrong, then going up from there.First and foremost, one of the worst parts of the game has to be the auto-battle option. You see, you'll be doing tons of big battles here, and if you feel like you don't need to oversee this one, you can just let the AI do it for you. However it seems the auto-battle AI is as brain-dead as Trump. I've lost quite a lot of battles because I had a ton of crap to fight and didn't wanna spend an hour doing them all properly. The last one being over 2k of my troops against 200 rebel peasants. F#CKING PEASANTS. AND MY TROOPS WERE HIGH TIER, WITH SIEGE UNITS AND EVERYTHING. HOW THE F#CK DID THAT HAPPEN!? It will make your playthroughs stupidly long, but I seriously advice you to not use that feature at all.Second is something I'm still not a big fan of. At the start you only have three factions to choose, the three big families of rome (not counting the Senate). However there's a f#ckload of factions, to unlock them you must be the one taking their last area on the map. Why? Why not, for example, certain factions unlocking others at the end of a long game? This way you might unlock a few of them in one game, most likely the ones you don't really want, and will have to restart anew with a faction that's closest to the one you do like, putting yourself through with a faction you don't want. Lastly, I feel like archers are a bit too powerful at times. Sure, heavy troops can tank those arrows and horse units can just sprint to them and whoop their asses, but then we got archers on horses and the whole balance f#cks itself. Elephants are also somewhat powerful since the auto-balance system doesn't seem to understand what the f#ck they do and usually win insane battles.That being said, this is a really cool strategy game that still stands strong after all these years that will give you hours and hours of fun for a really low price.The thing I like the most, strangely enough, is the realism and history stuff on it. It's actually kinda fun to sometimes stop and read all of the stuff the game has to tell you about troops, buildings and such. If you actually don't know much about the roman times, you'll learn a lot in here.The strategy itself is also really cool. It's not one of those ""send all of your troops against them blindly"" kind of games. The game is surprisingly deep and there's tons of cool tactics you can use to win even the most harsh fights.The amount of factions is also impressive for the time the game came off. There's like f#cking 40 or so, from all of those there HAS to be at least ONE you like. Also, as dumb as it might sound, the dialogue from the captains before the fights are so well written, I can't help but to stop and listen to them constantly. Seriously, they had a blast with those.Honestly, if you want Shogun 2 but you can't affort it, this is a really good alternative. On a sale it costs like 1 or 2€ and it's completely worth it. Though if you do have the money, I'd say give Shogun 2 a try instead.TL;DR Edition: A classic that still stands strong by now. While Shogun 2 feels better, this one is way cheaper. If you enjoy hollywood-speeches, then it's already worth the purchase.			"

												(go to discr_strat to add in factions) My Barbarian invasion story:I started as the Burgundii and decided to become a pirate by building 200 boats and decided to form a horde. I send my King and his sons on the boats and set sail for a life as a pirate. First i raid Denmark then set sail and raided York. Raids the coasts of france, found the Roman Emperor in a costal town on the west coast of france, i then perceed to raid it and thus killing the emperor. I then raid the coast of spain, i then headed  to Morrocco but they decided to send reinforcements to the city i was raiding, therefore decided to go back to the ships and carry on too Carthage. The Romans, clearly not forgeting my regiced decided to send a huge reinforcement of ships and attacked killing the king and his borthers. But all  hope was not lost, by some meraculous chance (probably a glitch due to his two son maturing on board the ship while it was attacked) the king must have sent his 16 year old sons on a ship to escape the battle, and must have got ship recked off the coast of Mauritania and traveled to western Algeria. While travelling through the desert his name must have ment much in the area as hundreds of local mercenairies flocked to his side. He also gained great knowlage of philosophy and his brother converted to Christianity and became deeply interested in theology. After about a decade of travelling they converged on the wooden walled city in the middle of an oasis in the Sahara. The city contained the crown prince of the berbers and wasnt going to give it up easily, and thus he was defeated by the narrowest of margins, but  out of the some respect he let the two princes go so they decided to head east and found a small poor city in modern day Libya. The recent economic crisis had taken hold despite rapid modernisation they decided to leave. The Christian prince decided he wanted too go to the holy land to settle and free from Roman tyranny, his pagan brother agreed and they set sail for Jerusalem. they stopped off at crete which they promptly freed from the Romans and started to modernise a great fleet to get too Jerusalem, however when they set sail again they where intercepted by a roman fleet which won a narrow victory agianst him were he was then killed. Though the philospher princes had with no hair, word must have spread and a new Bergundii warlord, that had prevoiusly parted with the king when the king decided to become a pirate, had heard of the legendry philosphers and their wish, so he and the remnents of the Burgundii army attacked constaninople and used it to cross to Anatolia where they went down a coast route evading roman forces. from a secret path shown too them by a local spy they had managed to besige Jerusalem, they had won as the city wasnt properly gaurded and they managed to settle Jerusalem. After 6 mounths (1 turn) after the conquest of Jerusalem, the warlord had died of the plague and once agian with no heir the royality of the Burgundii had fallen. The end.10/10 Somehow you can create awsome stories (from events and traits) when you form a horde on Barbarian Invasion.			"

												One of the 10 best PC games of all time; far better than Rome 2 TW overall.   Unit collisions, gameplay, factions, diplomacy, family, historical battles, modding, ... just to name a few.  This game engine was the star of not one, but 2 television shows (Decisive Battles on History Chanel with Matthew Settle, and Time Commanders on BBC from 2003-2005).   An excellent mod for the game is Darthmod 9.01.  There are many others excellent mods.Added 9 months later:Still the best overall TW game, followed by MTW2. If this game were updated with increased family, factions, diplomacy, and maybe most importantly not use that Warscape 2.5 engine (crap collisions no matter how they try to mask it in Sho2 & later games, even tho Sho2 has best use to date of that obsolete from day 1 lousy excuse of an engine), I would pay up to $100 for it. But not for a screwed up ""reinvent the wheel"" excuse of a game and gameplay like in RTW2.			"

												So good that to this date mods are still being released for it. A pillar for the Total War series and the best Creative Assembly release for the Roman Era (better than Rome 2 in every way but the graphics). If you get this, like every other good TW title, make sure to try out some mods as they make the game infinitely replayable and will provide you with the best Rome 1 Total War moments. Mods like Rome Total Realism or Europa Barbarorum are two of my favorite. Mods help out in what the game lacks, which is historical accuracy. Some even improve the AI and even the outdated graphics. Unlike the most recent titles with the terrible battle animations, in Rome 1 if a soldier is surrounded by 5 enemy soldiers all of them will stab him untill his hitpoints reach 0 and he dies, instead of playing a battle animation with every single one of them while the others look and wait.

												rome total war is by far the winning game of the series with epic battles and great history behind it rome has an amazing imperial campaign fighting for the 3 factions of rome. but still you can have a lot of fun on free play you cannbe macedon or persia grreks or romans? which do you prefer if you want to be  a true total fan you got to play this. this started the thick series it is now think about that when you are playing and complaining about graphics?  I dont care about graphics most of the time. but its a fine game!			"

												10\10 (Life changing)While my steam play is only about 10 hours, I used to play this game back when you would goto the store to buy a computer game (or the fifth grade). That being said, I've easily put hundreds of hours into this game over the years.This game was the first of the total wars I've played and stands second to maybe the newer versions of total war games. Smooth interactions on the campain and battle maps make navigation and stratgy easy. The A.I. can be easy at times but ramp up the difficulty and you may find yourself in a tricky spot during your campain. The game offers many different factions with a big yet easy to follow diplomacy setting and notifications to allow you to build up your own faction. Today the Mulitplayer is acomplishable but unless you have a freind that plays you probably wont find another player.The steam version is up to date as you would expect and is a great  and cheap way to break anyone into the total war experience without beating an older PC to death with the high demands of shogun 2 (awesome game as well) and Rome 2 (which was dissapointing). RECOMMNEDED.			"

												A classic... This does make it a must play? no... simply because there are other total war games with a better gameplay and smarter AI. However, i must say that Rome original is better than Rome2... Simply because, they focused waaay to much on graphics and dumb zoomed in fighting in rome 2...While this game aint better than shogun 2 or medieval 2... it is better than any other total war and a must for a total war fan. and a classic nonetheless.. It offers much in terms of strategic options and tons of units and factions.... barbarian invasions is still my favorite total war dlc... to the point where, its worth buying this game just for the dlc... yea graphics arent good, but if you are the kind of baddie that likes to zoom in to watch soldiers hit each other... than plz stick to potato games.. with difficulties varying from potato to veryeasy...

												My biggest 2 issues with this game:Campaign: Holding large territories is virtually impossible due to unrest, I guess that is historically accurate (even on easy), but counter-intuitive to your objectives.Battles: Unit and camera control are both a disaster. Why they decided against a traditional RTS camera (even though there is an RTS camera option in the game) is beyond me. Moving the mouse to the sides rotates the camera instead of scrolling the map...same goes for the arrow keys. Units themselves are hard to control and rarely do what you tell them to. Want your cavalry to attack a certain squad from behind? Well, first you have manually move them to avoid all other enemies in sight and then they may still attack the wrong enemy. Battles frequently look like masses of pixels trying to get to the enemy, but the game engine doesn't allow that.A good example of how to do it right would be Dawn of War. Here units first engage in ranged combat, but when they are forced into melee they are actively looking for a direct opponent instead of creating 2 big masses of armies that patiently wait until the front line disintegrates. You can micro manage some of that, but honestly, it's really annoying and just lazy in my opinion.Apart from that the game is actually pretty good if you're looking for Grand Strategy and the historic battles you can replay from the menu are fun and challenging, but also give you interesting info about what happened back then.

I play this game so much, had my discs for this game not get crushed, I'd still be playing off the disk. All in all, between playing on disk and playing this game from Steam, I easily have around 6,000 hours playing and modding this game. Still can't find a game better than this.			"

That feeling when I just finished and won decisive victories then the game would not respond and automatically close and the autosave wouldn't save the aftermath of the battle. Puts my efforts and time to waste. If only they could make some sort of patch for this game, then I'll gladly change my review to a positive one. I'd still play this game though. And I'll just restart this game if I think I've played long enough which may be the cause of the game crashes.			"

												This game can be really fun at times, however the game is dated in some areas. Firstly the AI is very poor and is easy to thwart because they make to many stupid descisions. Secondly senate missions end up becoming pointless near the end of the game and give you no reason to complete them.Fortunately those were the only real complaints I had with this game, altogether it is a really fun experience that (for a game that came out in 2005) has not aged as much as I originally thought it would. I would definitely recommend this game to old and new players of turn based strategy games!8/10			"

												The goal of Rome: Total War is to conquer, rule, and manipulate the Roman Empire until you're declared the Imperator of Rome. Rome: Total War is set in a time when the mighty Roman Empire emerged to conquer the known world; when gladiators fought to a bloody death in the Colosseum; and when Hannibal led his invincible army and his war elephants across the Alps. Now you can experience all these legendary moments and more, while building cities and settlements that can grow and develop over time. "

												The reason this says I have only played about .3 hours is becuse I have the game as a nonsteam game, so I family shared this version. This game is the greatest game of all time.No joke, unlike its terrible succesor, Total War Rome 2, This game is superior with AI, campaign and battles. You pick a faction in 270 BC and build armies and take over the entire ancient world. The Campaign is spectacular, with good campaign AI and diverse factions. I personally believe that Medieval 2 Total War had the better campaign but thats not the point. The Battles are very good, making you think real time tactics for your army so your enemy doesnt kill you. Wether you like strategy games or not, you buy this game. BUY IT RIGHT NOW (and not Rome 2 cause it sux)			"

												he game that launch the Total War series towards heights that it could've never dreamed of. This game is a turn-based strategy game where you take command the various factions during the Roman Era as you command, build, govern and attack Rome's enemies.The battle system unlike the system you will see in the modern day versions of the game is really simplistic. Sort of like an almost modern update of Imperial Glory. Now of course, the usual complaint would be ""OMG the game is too hard"" or ""OMG the online players are wrecking me"" Luckily the game has an in-depth tutorial plus you have all the time in the world as this game offers various combat both historical and custom made as you polish your skills in battle. And also being a leader of Rome.			"

												Suprisingly, the ai is very smart for being such an old game.Started as the Julii and went into battle against some barbarians in northern italy near the mountains.The enemy barbarians put up their shields in a defensive stance as my soldiers approached which was a surprising mechanic.Told my soldiers to charge at the enemy but somehow things went horribly wrong and my army started routing.The enemy warriors then lowered their shields, charged, and slaughtered my army.The AI is incredibly smart which makes me wonder how CA went from this to the lazily put together games of today.

												As a newcomer to the Total War series, I must express just how enthralled I am by the gameplay of Rome: Total War. It is an impressive strategy game that lets you live out those dreams of amassing a large army. Now these armies can be massive, carrying at least 1,200 soldiers, and don't even get me started on the reinforcements. However, it's not just a mere 'pick up and play' sort of game. This is a game that requires thinking, as a turnbased strategy game. You start off with a faction in the imperial campaign, where you are then given a large map of Europe that is populated with other factions of that time, such as the Greek, Egyptians, Gauls, Spanish, and many more. It is up to you to conquer Europe and extinquish all other factions from the competition. You can also choose to become allies with a few of these factions, if you want. The diplomacy feature in this game provides heaps of options, from trade rights with other factions, to extortion, or you can tell other factions to attack your rivals.Each faction has its own economy, but I won't get into that. Admittedly, I'm not very good at this part. This requires constructing certain buildings to improve income, such as shrines to Jupiter or crops. You can choose to have each settlement have its own taxation. But set it too low, and your citizens may revolt and start an uprising. This is a game that requires lots of patience, and your experience should not be rushed. But there is no joy greater than conquering that final Spanish settlement, sending hundreds of infantry troops to slaughter them, while your archers lie back, and bring fire to the various buildings until finally, you have wiped their existence from the face of the Earth.Overall, Rome: Total War is a thrilling experience that you'll find yourself investing many many hours in. Oh, did I also mention that you can play historical battles that took place in real life? Or if that sounds too boring, you can create your own custom matches.			"

												One of my favorite Total War games. I used to play this all of the time, back when it was on CD. It provides a ton situations to deal with: politics, diplomacy, family, war, financing, and strategy. Your empire's development is slow to start, but soon after you empire expands diplomacy and senate appeasing is important. Then you have to worry about your new neighbors to the north who also want your land. However, the Senate wants another territory on the opposite side of the empire to be taken. So you have to balance your troops, as you can only afford so much. While that is going on your citizens are upset at the tax rate and need to be subdued.This game is complex and a great starting game for the Total War series. As it has many ways to play and I still to this day can be entertained, even with the graphics not being as shiny as Rome: Total War 2.			"

												It' is now worth saying no game is perfect, I will not call  this game perfect. but it is, perhaps, one of the greater gaming expirences. If you overlook the (now) outdated graphics, there is great gameplay, and the start of one of the most succesfull RTS (Real Tme Strategy) series ever. But enough positivity, lets look at what took this game down.the graphics are sub-par and the models only have spikes as feet on anything but the highest graphic setting. The sound is compresses and the AI is braindead approximatley 60% of the time, leaving little room for grand strategy. The AI on campign denies fair diplomecy for no reason and commences wars for no reason. this game is fantastic but those are the three biggest flaws. Not to mention the crippiling bugs!7/10			"

But other wise the game is fantastic, it allows you to work on Strategy and tactics in combat, but also allows you to work on management with a great and powerful empire in the campaign.			"

												It' is now worth saying no game is perfect, I will not call  this game perfect. but it is, perhaps, one of the greater gaming expirences. If you overlook the (now) outdated graphics, there is great gameplay, and the start of one of the most succesfull RTS (Real Tme Strategy) series ever. But enough positivity, lets look at what took this game down.the graphics are sub-par and the models only have spikes as feet on anything but the highest graphic setting. The sound is compresses and the AI is braindead approximatley 60% of the time, leaving little room for grand strategy. The AI on campign denies fair diplomecy for no reason and commences wars for no reason. this game is fantastic but those are the three biggest flaws. Not to mention the crippiling bugs!7/10			"

												I have played this game since around when it came out, and was happy to see it in the Humble Bundle. It still holds up well today, and is a good time waster. Other than a few bugs when trying to launch the game on Windows 10 (Had to disable Anti-Aliasing) it runs pretty smooth. You can still play this online with firends as well which is an added bonus. -Overall 10/10			"

												This is the best Total War in the franchise even better than Total War: Rome II. There's just so something awesome bout these factions that really make you feel you are the one who is controling everything and dominating all. The armies itself are very unique giving each faction their own individual units that make the game feel so much more refreshing when you're wanting to play another campaign because you have the chance to experience the different units.The gamplay itself is very strategic where you see your men in their formations and positions ready to attack or defend. You may be outnumbered but if you stick to formations, strategic planning you can win which I very like that you need to use your brain to win.The game has the best soundtrack in any Total war game, it fits the battles perfectly and makes it epic too. The Generals speech are very cool to hear aswel while you hear your soldiers cheering. Finally the utscenes are really entertaining to watch as well just seeing if your spy or assassn failed/succeeded the mission. Now when I say this game is better than Rome 2 I don't mean it but I do. Rome 2 has probably the most stupidest AI ever and the most content removed from. I won't go into detail because I am not reviewing the game (Also I don't have it on steam). "

												I love this game. That said, the tendency to crash before or after(which is much worse) battles, is fairly annoying. Wuhu! I just spectacularly annihilated an army, killing the king, taking the Capitol, winning the game...CRASH! At least when it has the decency to do it on the loading screen pre-battle you don't want to smash your computer. Would be nice to play all factions, but i hear there's a way to do that. Overall I like Seleucia or the Scipii best, Brutii next. Gauls have good shrines, too. If Seleucia could only make the Nike & Artemis shrines as well as their Hephaestus 1 they'd be invincible. Plus, I  LOVE all the cheats; never play without the money cheat or the fog 1. Making all the buildings at once also cuts down on excrutiating waiting for stuff to be built, wish I could get the troop cheats besides oliphaunt to work.(though the oliphaunts are cool) Yes , I'm a lazy control freak who'd play every game in god mode if possible, so I like as many cheats as I can get. I wish I could control all factions like on Medieval TW. Really, it's less like playing as king of an empire as the benevolent god that makes his chosen people totally wealthy & OP. My subjects are happy because they have low taxes & all the buildings in their city instantly built.(most of my governers have""the builder"" in their name.) I don't feel even remotely bad for cheating because the game does it all the time. I've had enemy cites down to 25/30% loyalty & they wouldn't rebel: it jumps to 100 randomly(with 4 high lvl spies & a smashed temple in it,1unit). Meanwhile, your citii rebel at 70%, with a full garrison. My other favorite thing in the game is the assassinations. Nothing beats winning the game by whacking the enemy heirs & king. Plus it's cool getting""the killer"" after your king's name. I've whacked many whole factions out of existence without ever going to war, with trade treaties the whole time. One thing I dislike about Barbarian Invasion is I can't use my sleazy go-to tactic of buying off the other 1/2 of the Empire's generals/troops/cities. ""ooo a 5-star general w/ a full stack...sure would be fun to make him turn on his own cities & butcher the inhabitants thereof."" I once bought Corinth off Macedonia as the Brutii to get the Zeus shrine. The senate wasn't pleased cuz it wasn't on their orders, but the people loved me. I bought a Gaul gen when I was Brutii, he sat in the capitol getting ancilliaries 'til he was 50 & I had an army for him, he then stomped all of Greece, took Halicarnassus, Rhodes, then Crete & finally Messina. He was 6 star, 9 when fighting in any situation. He became Praetor. I made him heir because he earned it, not to mention being way better than any of the family. Only the faction leader was his equivalent, but he'd fought as many battles & was Pontifex Maximus. What's the game like without all the cheats? Painfully slow & unplayable by my standards. Bankrupt & running a deficit within a couple of years, getting your butt whupped by ai that doesn't seem to be have a cashflow problem, they just contiunously build their cities & have huge army stacks everywhere.Mind you , I play on easy; I can't imagine what they think hard is. I've found many game devs equate easy with impossible. I think it means impossible to lose.(like when cheating heavily) I'm powerless enough in real life, when gaming, at least against ai, I want to be omnipotent. Losing's no fun, & I find it deeply satisfying to have no casualties in a battle where I annihilate the other army. I just want to crush my enemies, see them driven before me ,& hear the lamentation of the women, beacause that's what's best. "

												For an old game, it's pretty well made and executed. Definitely worth 10 bucks.I used to watch a lot of Rome Total War let's plays and I got pretty excited when I was able to download this from steam. The game starts you out playing as one of the three Roman factions, all of their intros distinct and unique. As I started the campaign I had a mixed sense of awe and fear. My first playthrough as the Brutii I enjoyed ravaging the cities of Macedon, Thrace and Greece. I did play on easy but there were some battles along the way that had suprised me and kept me emotionally invested in my campaign forth to the east. I remember countering the Phalanx heavy armies of Greece, Thrace, and Macedon, with skirmishers, artillery and archers whittling them down as they marched toward me. The same tactic worked for every battle with me always taking the hill. However I remember being annihilated by being caught in-between reinforcements and the main Macedonian army. I won, I lost, and I would never make the same mistake again.After deciding to raise the stakes (Hard/Hard) and playing as a much less civilized faction (Germania) I found myself squished in-between the armies of Gaul, Britannia, and Dacia. I began my campaign reuniting the german people and invading what is now France and Britain and then proceeding into the territory that is known today as Austria. My empire was huge, to the west were the Spanish and to the east were the Scythians, and to the south were the Romans. With the Spanish and the Scythians at peace with me and Dacia all but scattered across the lands, I began my march into the Alps and into Rome itself.For the Romans, it seemed too late, battle after battle I left their Hestati and Principe armies defeated and scattered, their war machines burnt to the ground and their cities pillaged and burned. They could not stop the hordes of horsemen nor the cries of the beserkers, Rome was crumbling. However, I faced as much more devastating enemy as I conquered their cities, holding them. There were constant rebellions and with the Romans building navies and giant army stacks at sea (and then landing in my territory) I had a rough time with them. When the Romans took a city, I couldn't take it back, simply because their walls were too strong to hold at siege. The Julii and the Scipii were battling the Numidians and the Carthaginians to the south, and then using the wealth from those campaigns to take back their homes. The Brutii were marching entire armies of Urban Cohorts, Legionaries, and the Praetorian Guard at my doorstep. Soon, my economy collapsed and I had begun to fear the threat of being overrun. I could take Rome, but could I hold it? After countless battles I eliminated the Julii and both the Brutii and Scipii were on the run. My armies all had silver/gold chevrons weapons and armor (upgrades) after such battles, so I was able to defeat many of their experienced warriors.Then I decided to download Darthmod for Rome....Every battle against the Romans was different than before and it had me running scared. I fought smaller army stacks and although I would outnumber them my men would leave the battle completely depleted. I couldn't auto-resolve otherwise I would end up losing and with the Egyptians, Pontus, Thracians, and the Spanish barbarians marching toward my gates I had one hell of a time. All in all, I had more fun than any other game I've played. The mods bring me back, and the battles are fantastic. Rome: Total War is certainly worth the money.			"

Never got invitied onto the show, but i did get the game and it was such a brilliant game. Will literally get you hooked with minutes. The huge battles and indepth stragery. Overcoming real time problems on the battlefield. All here!! Only thing i didnt like was in the campaign about the squalor level, It would literally not stop rising regardless of what i did.			"

												Highly Recommend this game. First game in the total war series i played and by god it is good. Still is to this day!! I remember first seeing the game on tv""time commanders"" and i thought that was absolutly brilliant. I really wanted to find what game it was or atleast be on the show. Never got invitied onto the show, but i did get the game and it was such a brilliant game. Will literally get you hooked with minutes. The huge battles and indepth stragery. Overcoming real time problems on the battlefield. All here!! Only thing i didnt like was in the campaign about the squalor level, It would literally not stop rising regardless of what i did.			"

												For an old game, it's pretty well made and executed. Definitely worth 10 bucks.I used to watch a lot of Rome Total War let's plays and I got pretty excited when I was able to download this from steam. The game starts you out playing as one of the three Roman factions, all of their intros distinct and unique. As I started the campaign I had a mixed sense of awe and fear. My first playthrough as the Brutii I enjoyed ravaging the cities of Macedon, Thrace and Greece. I did play on easy but there were some battles along the way that had suprised me and kept me emotionally invested in my campaign forth to the east. I remember countering the Phalanx heavy armies of Greece, Thrace, and Macedon, with skirmishers, artillery and archers whittling them down as they marched toward me. The same tactic worked for every battle with me always taking the hill. However I remember being annihilated by being caught in-between reinforcements and the main Macedonian army. I won, I lost, and I would never make the same mistake again.After deciding to raise the stakes (Hard/Hard) and playing as a much less civilized faction (Germania) I found myself squished in-between the armies of Gaul, Britannia, and Dacia. I began my campaign reuniting the german people and invading what is now France and Britain and then proceeding into the territory that is known today as Austria. My empire was huge, to the west were the Spanish and to the east were the Scythians, and to the south were the Romans. With the Spanish and the Scythians at peace with me and Dacia all but scattered across the lands, I began my march into the Alps and into Rome itself.For the Romans, it seemed too late, battle after battle I left their Hestati and Principe armies defeated and scattered, their war machines burnt to the ground and their cities pillaged and burned. They could not stop the hordes of horsemen nor the cries of the beserkers, Rome was crumbling. However, I faced as much more devastating enemy as I conquered their cities, holding them. There were constant rebellions and with the Romans building navies and giant army stacks at sea (and then landing in my territory) I had a rough time with them. When the Romans took a city, I couldn't take it back, simply because their walls were too strong to hold at siege. The Julii and the Scipii were battling the Numidians and the Carthaginians to the south, and then using the wealth from those campaigns to take back their homes. The Brutii were marching entire armies of Urban Cohorts, Legionaries, and the Praetorian Guard at my doorstep. Soon, my economy collapsed and I had begun to fear the threat of being overrun. I could take Rome, but could I hold it? After countless battles I eliminated the Julii and both the Brutii and Scipii were on the run. My armies all had silver/gold chevrons weapons and armor (upgrades) after such battles, so I was able to defeat many of their experienced warriors.Then I decided to download Darthmod for Rome....Every battle against the Romans was different than before and it had me running scared. I fought smaller army stacks and although I would outnumber them my men would leave the battle completely depleted. I couldn't auto-resolve otherwise I would end up losing and with the Egyptians, Pontus, Thracians, and the Spanish barbarians marching toward my gates I had one hell of a time. All in all, I had more fun than any other game I've played. The mods bring me back, and the battles are fantastic. Rome: Total War is certainly worth the money.			"

												I enjoy this game and the history it depicts. Micro-managing can get tiresome if you are not naturally inclined, and don't trust the Auto managing. I have not ever played the multiplayer. I enjoy the roleplaying and strategic aspects. If you have an experienced assassin, he migh have this descriptor to accompany his experience level; 'the man is as cunning as a sackful of hungry weasels'4/5			"

												This is the best Total War in the franchise even better than Total War: Rome II. There's just so something awesome bout these factions that really make you feel you are the one who is controling everything and dominating all. The armies itself are very unique giving each faction their own individual units that make the game feel so much more refreshing when you're wanting to play another campaign because you have the chance to experience the different units.The gamplay itself is very strategic where you see your men in their formations and positions ready to attack or defend. You may be outnumbered but if you stick to formations, strategic planning you can win which I very like that you need to use your brain to win.The game has the best soundtrack in any Total war game, it fits the battles perfectly and makes it epic too. The Generals speech are very cool to hear aswel while you hear your soldiers cheering. Finally the utscenes are really entertaining to watch as well just seeing if your spy or assassn failed/succeeded the mission. Now when I say this game is better than Rome 2 I don't mean it but I do. Rome 2 has probably the most stupidest AI ever and the most content removed from. I won't go into detail because I am not reviewing the game (Also I don't have it on steam). "

												I played this game for years, and I remember the day I bought this game in a shop, and the first battles (battle at Carrhae, damn Horse archers!) and campaigns (Brutti and Julii, and that moment you unlocked more factions !!). It was really magical. Sadly the disk version is not working in windows 10, and on my older computer it really lags, so I bought it again, but now on steam, for a discount of 50%. On the plus side with Barbarian invasion.This is, in my opinion, the best total war game. Some may say it is not really historical, as you have factions like ""the Gauls"" and ""Germania"", while in reality they were countless tribes. True, but I never minded it. I always made my own stories. And that is the magic I think. You should create your own stories, like a king that unites the Dacian tribes and invades Greece, etc. You shouldn't play this game just for gameplay. No. Because you want to create your own stories and love the era. Everything is great, well, almost everything then. The campaign is fun, the battles are. You want to play as every faction, try everything out, etc. However, the Romans ofcourse are the best. You have the Senate, missions for them etc. Eventually you will get a pop up saying that the people want you to invade Rome and be their leader, so you can have a civil war! The few downsides are maybe the squalor problem, which will be rampant in the mid to late game, and sometimes breaks the fun, or the sporadic fps killers on modern computers. But I think they are neglectable. There are also tons of mods, but I have never tried one, I like the vanilla version.Great game, it is cheap nowadays (especcially during steam sales), plus you get Barbarian invasion, which moves the whole atmosphere to the end of the Roman Empire, and with religion, tribe migrations, etc. although I haven't tried it yet. STOP SCROLLING THROUGH THE REVIEWS, AND BUY IT ALREADY!!!			"

A must have to prepare for Rome 2.			"

												One of the best games of all time, and definitely the best RTS of all time. The graphics and physics engines have become a little dated (2004-based) but if you enjoy the time period or game genre Rome: Total War is a must-play. You can choose between many different factions, each with their own unique play style and units, and recreate history or forge your own path. You can use diplomats, assassins and spies, fleets and massive armies.Due to the (relative) simplicity of the coding there are mods aplenty from total conversions (think Lord of the Rings) to complete historical-accuracy rehauls, making Rome that much more replayable and unique.

Buy it on disc from a retailer or online, or torrent it. Why do you ask? In returning multiplayer to this game with steamworks, which I applaud CA for doing, they completely destroyed the performance of the game somehow. No clue how they manage to mess up something so simple, but I have about 100% worse performance with the steam version of the game compared to the older, gamespy version. Another thing is that 99% of mods aren't compatible with steam Rome Total War so you're going to have trouble playing your favourite overhauls with this. Serious FPS trouble with a i7 2600k and GTX 960 on MEDIUM settings, i'm talking drops to 10 FPS in not even remotely huge battles. Unacceptable. I get a almost smooth 60 in similar conditions on my disc copy.Pros - Multiplayer is returnedCons -Absolutely terrible performance for most people after the patchIncompatibility with most mods.			"

												I can't even pay the game. Every time I load it up it gives me a black screen and until i exit out to my desktop and close the game. Then once I close it, it says that i need Direct X installed to play the game which i made sure is installed. Overall you can buy the game at the risk of having it not work which isnt that bad because I have played this on my friend's pc and its really fun. Or you could just find something else to buy that you know that it won't 100% screw up.			"

												This game is really old, but I strangely enough still like it. There's a lot of bugs though, and there's a lot of features that are never mentioned in tutorials (I think, nobody ever plays tutorials anyway), like pressing shift to look where your unit is moving etc. Phalanxes are OP and so are Urban cohorts, so unless you're playing on easy you're screwed when you see those. IDK if you can still get this, but it's quite fun. "

												One of the best games of all time, and definitely the best RTS of all time. The graphics and physics engines have become a little dated (2004-based) but if you enjoy the time period or game genre Rome: Total War is a must-play. You can choose between many different factions, each with their own unique play style and units, and recreate history or forge your own path. You can use diplomats, assassins and spies, fleets and massive armies.Due to the (relative) simplicity of the coding there are mods aplenty from total conversions (think Lord of the Rings) to complete historical-accuracy rehauls, making Rome that much more replayable and unique.

												Reality : Why Egyptians wear the Anicent Egyptian Costume? This Starting Period is BC 272. Not Ancient Egypt! In that time, Egypt was ruled by Ptolemy Dynasty(Ptolemy was served at Alexander's Expeditionary Army)Battle : Fast Battle, Enjoyable Battle. But Not worth to purchase. I think Rome II is realistic than this. Computer Requirment : If you satisfy some requirements, You can play it even if you have low-quality computer. Management and Diplomacy : If you expect that its systems are similar to CK2 or EU4, Give up your expectation.  Its Diplomacy is simple. Trade Agreement for Economy, Build s buildings for satisfication, Military and Order, Get/give money from/to another country.			"

I dont know what they have done but the game code is altered(1.51 version) and does not run as smoothly as the original CD version (1.5) especially if you havent the most state of the art PC. Find the original and dont worry there are still ways to play multiplayer as well with even greater quality than you would on steam.			"

												I played this game a fair bit in about 2006, around there.  The story mode is boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥and I never played much of that.  But you can create your own battles which is fantastic.  Ever wanted to pit an army of flaming pigs against an army of elephants?  Now you can.  Or you do more conventional♥♥♥♥♥♥with Roman legions and Egyptian military types and Greek♥♥♥♥♥♥and a few different barbarian things.Where this game hits the toilet is the AI.  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥  They seem to have improved it between patches but even the finished product leaves a lot to be desired.  Probably the biggest annoyance is that the AI won't attack unless you do.  They'll just stand there until you get in range.  Ridiculous.Pwninator score: 6/10			"

												Developed by The Creative Assembly, Rome: Total War is a revolutionary classical title in the best-selling Total War series that carries players into the midst of ancient history's most intense conflicts. Rome: Total War features groundbreaking technology [For it's time]  that brings the epic, cinematic battles of the Roman era to life with graphics and gameplay beyond anything previously seen in a PC game, at that time. Players will be transported to the battlefields of ancient history's greatest conflicts and control mighty armies. Up to 10,000 fully polygonal, highly detailed, motion-captured warriors can appear on the screen at once. They control vast armies led by history's most legendary generals including Julius Caesar and Hannibal, and must use a combination of brains and brawn to successfully conquer the Roman Empire.			"

												I played this game for about 80 hours shortly after it came out (I don't know, 10 years ago or something). It was fun at the time, and can be fun still. It took a little tweaking to get it to run under Steam. Have to set the -ne option so the game runs in windowed mode in order to go into the video settings and set the correct resolution (otherwise it just quits right after starting up). That problem solved, I jumped in at 1920x1200 and it ran fine. But, I am reminded of the user interface which I did not like last time I played it. The graphics have also aged poorly after so many years. I recall at the time, and again just today when I put another hour into the game, that the UI is distracting, making it take about twice as long to get things done as I would prefer (versus a competing game like Civilization IV, at the time, which is much smoother to handle). Overall, I can't recommend this game today to anyone but a fan of the series. There are better strategy choices. Not least of which is Rome II, which is more updated than this old one.			"

												Oh wow.  Performance is really bad.  I mean BAD.  My main machine has a FX8320 @ 4.6GHz and an overclocked HD7850.  Can't run the game at more than 30fps no matter what settings I lower or turn off.  Tried it on a secondary machine with a stock Phenom 9650 and a R7 260X and the same deal.  I clearly remember being able to play this game a little after it came out with an Opteron 165 and a X1950XT at full settings with no fps problems.  At first I imagined it was a driver issue, but then I decided to dig out my old original RTW CDs, and after jumping several hoops to get it installed, sure enough, I was able to play the game at max settings with my fps numbers in the high 50s on average.  WUT?Whatever.  I got it on sale and for convenience (my old CDs are scratched already).  As it is the game is painful to play.  I then read the negative Steam reviews after the fact.  I highly recommend the game, just not this version.			"

												A bit dated now, but it still has the best feel of all the total war games due mainly to the music and sound. The epic feel of defending against a siege attack, rushing your tired men to and from weak points, again the music brings real tension in the battles, elation in victory and almost tears when your once certain victory is snatched from you in the last minutes. Its one of those games that will give you great memories. You will actually feel fear when you see a full stack of gaullish celts appear from a mountain pass on the main map, not knowing what there intentions are and hoping they dont come your way. This game also enables you to play the excellent Europa Barborum mod for the history pedants.  "

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												This is a bad game that found itself with a good reputation. The epic 3D battles were so stunning that critics were willing to ignore some major flaws.To call the AI stupid is an insult to the very concept of stupidity. It fights battles well enough, but simply cannot handle the campaign map, which means it rarely has any troops to bring to the battle. Even heavy doses of cheating cant help this guy. Wheatly would be better.Diplomacy is an incredible pain in the neck. You cannot just summon a rival to a meeting; you must train a Diplomant, have him physically walk across the map; and then suggest a trade, which the AI will disagree to.There is only one starting faction: Rome. To play as anyone else you must complete the campaign... which grows boring long before your even close to done.If your looking to get into Total War (which is a very good idea) I would reccomomend Shogun 2, Attila, or Warhammer. If you want to see what the series is all about without breaking the bank, grab the original Shogun. It utilizes a Risk style map that makes life for the AI much, much better.Whatever you choose, I hope you enjoy.			"

												Only because for some reason it's ridiculously unstable, I got 100 turns into a campaign and it seems to CTD no matter how many saves I go back. It's still infinitely better than anything CA has released since medieval 2, and for a fraction of the priceCombat in this game is fast paced and fun, with many varied units and every faction having a unique feel. The battle AI is what you'd expect from a 10 year old game - having said that, it's better than many new entries in terms of self preservation and repositioning. The campaign takes some understanding of its intricacies (particularly cultural unrest and squalor), but once understood becomes easily manageable, and allows you to better array and deploy forces as you see fitOnce you beat the game (which can take a few days) you'll also have access to almost all of the other factions in the game (without a £3 entry fee, unlike more recent releases) which provides tonnes of replay valueGet this game, but maybe not on steam - my hard copy from 10 years ago works fine and doesn't corrupt my saves, so I can only assume it's a problem with the steam release			"

												You may be wondering I have not recomendded total war.  Well the reason for that is quite simple.  If i had just recomended it, then my review would have been lost among a sea of other reviews that also recomend it.  Hopefully someone somewhere will actually see this because its in a much smaller pool.  Anyway Rome total war is an excellent game, tatics while rather straightforward most of the time are realistic and you need to have a basic understanding of strategy to beat the AI on anything above easy.  Every faction has different unit compositions to use so your tatics will have to change on subsequent playthroughs.  Basically Rome Total war has a stunning amount of depth and historical accuracy put into it.  While the graphics don't hold up a decade later, the gameplay is superior to even the sequel Rome TW 2 which came out several months ago.  This game is worth the full price even today, and if your looking to get into total war, or getting your friends into total war, this is a great starting point or gift respectively.  To give you some basic tatics, rome's usual goal is to when not facing phalanxes just mash your infantry into the enemy, as your infantry are essentially the greatest in the world.  While there is more to it then that namely using light infantry to hold your flanks whilst heavy infantry splits the enemy down the center, using your cavaly to take out enemy seige weapons or to flank a phalanx, thats all there is to it.  When playing as greece your goal is to not get flanked, as you have the most powerful phalanxes in the world and will almost never lose if you don't get flanked.  Carthages goal is to use elephants and support cavalry to literaly blow holes in the enemy line and crush enemy morale, whilst your infantry pin the enemies center or flanks in place, depending on the lay of the land.  If your parthia you want to make the enemy chase you and use hit and run tactics as you have the best cavalry in the world, and the greatest horse archers to ever live.  and so on.  Basically buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game.			"

												Don't waste your time or money on any Rome game. You'll see a lot of unhappy players if you read the comments in the boards. I can't get the application to load after playing the training mod a few times. Oh, I get the introductory animations but my excitement wanes as soon as the screen turns forever black when the actual game loads. Sega's so-called technical support puts the blame on video and sound drivers. I have the ""best"" sudio driver, but AMD recommended a different video driver. It did not change anything. How long does it take Sega to debug a game? Rome has been out a long time, hasnt it?I would have liked to try the Napoleonic Total War, but I'm not wasting anymore money on Sega.			"

												When I first bought this when it was first released (back in them ol' pre-Steam days), I was ultimately underwhelmed by it. Then I played it again, and grew to like it more. I lost the CD's, but found it on Steam and got it to try playing it again. After a while, I uninstalled it. Now, at least twice in the past few years, I've thought about the game, reinstalled it, played it for a day or two, then uninstalled it again. Why? Because, really, in the end, I'm underwhelmed.RTW CAN be a fun game. I've done multiplayer against friends, and enjoyed it immensely. I like the various units available. With the Roman factions, I like playing the various quests to win approval in the Senate and among the populace. I wouldn't call it the worst game in existence.So why, then, am I still underwhelmed?First, there are some serious problems with this game's battle mechanics. You will have to literally micromanage your units, and like 1-year old children you won't be able to leave them alone for a while, because if you do they will do amazingly stupid things. For example, I had a cavalry unit chase after some routing archers, went to another spot of the battlefield, then when I went back to the cavalry unit, I saw they had decided it would be an awesome idea to charge headlong into a line of spears, and were suffering tremendous casualties. This doesn't even cover that sometimes you could give individual units specific orders, and they'll just ignore you. Then there are some SERIOUS pathfinding issues. Units will take the most random routes to go from point A to point B, even when there shouldn't be an issue. The biggest example of this I can think of was one time when I was besieging a city, and was charging my men (who were not routing) down the main road in the city - apparently, ""go charge at the enemy right in front of you"" translated into ""turn around and head back outside of the city.""Second, the campaign map part of the game will be annoying. Diplomacy is virtually USELESS. You could set up alliances with all your neighbors, get trade deals, and generally be peaceful...and then suddenly, for absolutely NO DISCERNABLE REASON, all your neighbors will, one by one, declare war on you. OK, fine, this game is called Total WAR, maybe that can be forgiven. However, none of your opponents will EVER accept a peace deal, even if you've destroyed all their armies in several embarrassing battles, and have taken all their cities except their capitol. You could offer them the best peace deal ever that would ensure their survival, and they would still say, ""Nope! Fight to the end!"" On top of this, naval battles are just annoying: while they automatically auto-resolve all naval battles, they rarely involve the complete destruction of one side. You could have a fleet of 300 sailors up against a fleet of 13 sailors, and it would still end with the enemy getting away somehow. Aside from blockading fleets, I end up just not caring about navy battles.There are also some issues and bugs that I've noticed in the Steam version of RTW that I didn't see in the original RTW or its expansion. One of the biggest issues is that reinforcements seem to ALWAYS be delayed. Originally it was sporadic enough that it helped make the battles random and unpredictable...now, I no longer expect the reinforcements to come, because the minute I get into battle I get a notification that the reinforcements - either for me or the enemy - have been delayed.In the end, RTW is just not an enjoyable entry into the TW series. After a certain point of wondering why a one-city nation decided it would be wise to launch an attack against my empire, or after the fifth time I've suffered casualties because my men are wandering around the battlefield like wet hens and ignoring what I told them to do, I lose all interest in playing it, and uninstall it. If you want to play a Total War game, I would go look elsewhere.			"

												Total war is a cross between Turn Based Strategy and Real Time Strategy genres, sadly it fails at both. The fights are bland and unless you really enjoy spending 45 minutes of mind numbing unit micromanagement for each battle you'll just let the AI auto resolve conflicts. All you are left with is a mediocre turn based campaign map with military centric building like which barely rivals browser based RTS MMOs (The mechanics are really that simplistic). I've only put in a few hours on this game because honestly I don't see the point. From the very start I had problems with the game, glitchy problems. The tutorial cannot be saved; if you can't sit down and play it for 1 hour straight just forget about the tutorial unless you want to leave the game running in the taskbar while you are away. Then, when I finally got the time to play it for one hour straight, the camera glitched and kept panning to the lower right corner of the map. Since I couldn't save the tutorial I had to quit and start it all over AGAIN for the third time. So I'm through the tutorial, now what? Time to conquer the known ancient world for the glory of Rome! Woot! Three battles later and my mind is changed, this is just boring and pointless. Every battle seems to be pretty much the same, you set up units and let the killing commence. Unit collision never seems to work and in R:TW it means your units behave like daft plebeians; trying to get them all through a gate, ha, half of them always split off and the rest of the time what? Do you really enjoy watching 1000 virtual units fail at each incessantly until the other unit's demise? How about friendly fire? Good stuff right? Your archers mowing down your own army because you forgot to click each archer 'card' and tell them to stop it! How about a real cool zoomed in shot with arrows flying into the camera, cool right?! It is cool the first couple of times but the *cool* factor wears off real quick and you are left struggling to control 1k units who are completely lost without your incessant management. The main map is really no better, it's even more focused on military then your run of the mill RTS. I was really hoping for something more akin to Civilization in depth where you actually gather multiple resources and manage your production but here all that seems to matter is hording gold through exorbitant taxes. This way you build more boring buildings that your citizens need to be happy so you can train more boring armies so you can fight more boring battles at the Senate's behest. Are you bored yet? I think the original title for this game must have been ""Rome: Realistic Battle Simulator"" but when first screened to an audience the reception was lukewarm so they changed it to something sexier. TLDR, Unless you really enjoy overly simplistic empire management where every RTS battle is 30 minutes or more of the exact same assault plan I recommend you pass on this glorified combat simulator.

												After playing a ton of Empire Total War and Shogun 2 Total War, this game just does not compare.  I had played a bunch of this game back when it was released, and I loved it.  Compared to more contemporary Total War games it just does not hold up.  So many of the game mechanics are frustrating.  It will make you yell at the screen.  Things like moving troops around during a battle is handled so much better in Shogun 2 that you are going to be at a complete loss as to why they didn't do it sooner and how did you have march your armies north against Gaul in the past.

												This game is thoroughly outclassed in every way by the more recent entries in the Total War series. The mechanics and graphics are very unpolished and rather unpleasant in comparison. I personally prefer both the more recent (e.g. Medieval II, Shogun 2) and the older (Medieval I) because the former are more polished and the latter have a different, most risk-style gameplay, that I kind of preferred.

												After I have played ROME 2: TOTAL WAR ( best TW game so far), i decided to play R1 as an act of respect for the precursor.I have reviewed fancy metascore and was really exited of this game... until i have run it. The graphiсs and engine are awful, there is no possibility to play as Sparta (why, CA, why?) and instead of that there are 4(!) same factions called Romans. In addition, there are no actual battles, depleted units are not auto-recovering, and for diplomacy you need to hire tons of characters instead of simply doing it through the special menu.There is no balance in war system. As in ROME 2: TOTAL WAR you can choose any faction and be sure that you going to be able to handle opponent, so that requires some skill and thinking, but to win in R1  you simply need to counter opponent with supreme troops…so no tactics here. In addition, Rome is too overpowered and can destroy almost any army in the easy way.Multiplayer is full of weird kids kicking everybody for not-knowing some 3-letter word (don’t remember it), the other guys with CAPS names are ignorant by putting passwords on their games. WHY?The only fun I had was doing some bridge battles, where 300 Spartans♥♥♥♥♥♥♥4000 romans (going to upload it soon).So, my final decision is 5/10.Would have rather bought “beasts of war” dlc for R2TW.

												To me this game and the first Medieval are the best Total War games. It's really enjoyable with lots of unique strong units. For example the Medieval 2 game often feels like ""throw more of the same"" or ""throw a little better ones"" till the end of the turns, which makes a repetitive gameplay. In Rome you may enjoy your level nine heavy horse archers with +5  to attack (as far as I remember temple + blacksmith bonus) that can sweep everything in front of them. And if you are tired of the vanila campaign, there are some really good mods like Total Realism which may cost you countless sleepless nights. Use on your own risk.			"

												This game is one of the best grand strategy games ever made. While light on diplomacy, this game focuses heavily on the latter two words of the title: Total War.Starting out in 270 BC, you take the helm of one of the patrician families of Rome: the Julii, the Scipii, or the Brutii. While functionally the same, each one has you expanding the empire in a different direction, against different enemies. You must serve the Senate and People of Rome (the SPQR) during your campaigns if you are ever to realise your true final goal: domination of the other Roman families, and the siezure of Rome itself. After completing a campaign as one of the families of Rome, you unlock several new factions to play as, each with their own unique units, religious buildings, locations and much more.The Good:+Turn-based campaign map and real time battles keep the tempo just right. You'll never get bored or be bombarded with too much action.+Very diverse factions, but the Romans typically are the best to start with, due to their favorable situation. More veteran players will like the other factions for their increased challenge.+Challenging campaign that forces you to think about what you are doing, and hopefully not make decisions you'll regret.+Graphics have aged well for a decade old game, and it runs very well on modern systems. Only very underpowered machines will struggle with this game.+Music is intense and epic, and gives the battles a sense of awe when they are large enough.+Battles are fun and can be very challenging. Don't be surprised if the AI outsmarts you sometimes!The Bad:-AI is not always very good. It does not handle sieges very well, and naval warfare is usually trivial as they rarely keep sizeable fleets. Also, weak factions will attack you (often the most powerful faction in the game) for seemingly no reason, and enemies on the brink of destruction will make outrageous demands to you, while your armies are at their doorstep.-Diplomacy is very limited. You can make very limited demands and offers, make alliances and trade rights, but that's about it.-Feed back from the game's building and condition descriptions are very poor, giving the player almost no feed back.The Iffy Stuff (stuff that some people will like, others won't):=The game is VERY long. Even a short campaign will run you a few hours, and you'll need to set aside a few days to do a long one. However, this means this cheap game will provide TONS of entertainment.=The game is quite old, so some will scorn its simplicity, but others will like it.Conclusion:Rome: Total War is still one of the games that truly defines strategy, and its impact is still being felt today. A must buy for strategy enthusiasts and new comers alike.			"

												I just got done writing a review for TW: Rome 2 and realised my whole review could've been summed into the words ""Go play Rome 1 instead.""This game, where to even begin? I played an ungodly amount of this game back in the day and when I returned to it, it still felt brilliant as ever. Get some mods off TW: Centre and this game feels fresh and exciting every single time you play it. The graphics look a bit block up close but you'll be at a bird's eye view most of the time so it's of no matter. The unit differences are great. The intra and interfactional politics are ever relevant and fun to play with. The political system allows amazing freedom and flexibility in your diplomatic relations. The deployment of troops makes sense. The strength of weapons and missles make sense. The AI doesn't ever feel overpowered. Seriously, get this game and get a mod like Total Realism.For 10$ you will not get a better RTS game out there honestly. If you need a number, this game gets a 10/10, 5 stars, 100% whatever just do yourself a favour and get this. If TW: Rome 2 left a bad taste in your mouth, this game will fix it by causing endless ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												Rome: Total War is what its title advertises, the Roman Empire (and the other factions that existed during that period) and the vast, complex and often overwhelming task of leading your chosen faction to greatness. The game is a unique blend of turn-based strategy and real time tactics that Creative Assembly has turned into an ever flourishing series that has earned its praise many times over.You control everything from what buildings to construct in your cities, to which factions you want to conduct business with. That's the turn-based part. Where the ""real time tactics"" come in is when you fight a battle, commanding your units in real time, as you might have guessed.As far as combat is concerned, it's solid to say the least. You have a great amount of control over your units, even being able to tell them where to move siege towers. However, there are, of course, flaws. It's always frustrating to have your soldiers attack enemies that you didn't send them after, especially when those enemies just happen to be the very thing that can chop your precious soldiers to bits.The diplomacy also suffers a bit, since the AI tends to reject even the most reasonable offers, no matter how much they would profit from them, unless you have a diplomat with a high influence stat, which is gained through successful negotiations. This creates a vicious cycle of useless diplomats, leaving you to solve all matters with the sword, rather than the pen.Over all, this game, however old, is still a gem and well worth your time.			"

They depict those who ride atop a horse in this game as an unkillable demigod with the power of a thousand suns at their disposal, when they charge into some poor unknowing enemy unit they simply dissapear in a shower of pink mist, leaving on Hiroshima style shadows imprinted on the ground. Don't ever build any foot units or archers, even if you need to scale a wall with ladders or a siege tower, just let the horses run up it (trust me they can if you give them enough hay). An amazing horse-based game, would not reccommend playing if you are a pig however.			"

The vanilla game alone is amazing with what you can do, whether you wish to take the path of Caesar and conquer Gaul and put a foothold in Britannia or push your phalanx in a bloody line across Greece, you won't ever be lacking in entertainment for the best installment to date in the TW series.That's without even talking about the mods. There are dozens, from all different timeperiods, or even different worlds. Mods that improve on graphics or the realisticness of battle. Mods that add an incredible historic aspect to the already immersive gameplay.10/10 would lead House Scipii to conquer 100% of the campaign map again.			"

												If you've never played any of the Total war series games, I highly recommend buying this first before considering any of the others, because this is the one that will lay the foundationn in your mind of what a total war game should be like. Despite its age (graphics, ai), it is still easily one of the best game of its genre and you won't regret getting it. If you want a more detailed review then keep scrolling, but I'm just going to answer your question on whether or not to buy this masterpiece: Hell yes, I bought it for 5 dollars when it was on sale, but hey, I'd buy it even if it was 10 dollars or even 20! if I knew how good this game was. It's really worth every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ penny, you hear me!?!? EVERY PENNY!!! I still come back to this game every so often and I end up getting myself sucked into this amazing game. MY RATING!? ITS OVER 9000!!!!!!!! Just buy the game. Do it. You know you want to. =)			"

												i had two problems running this game on windows 8.1 64 bit (first: game doesn't launch, only a black screen and then returns to desktop; second: problem ""Failed to find Steam""). I finally managed to resolve both, so in case some of you have the same problems, here i post the solutions. I tried many solutions i found on internet:-copied the Steam.dll file from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam-deleted the ClientRegistry.blob file from C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam (Make sure you are not logged on Steam when doing this).-tried every possible compatibility mode, but not working-tried disabling steam community in game from game properties on steam-tried the solution down here.     1: Right-click on ""Computer"" (in XP it was called ""My Computer"") and click on Properties.    2: in Vista / 7, on the left click on ""Advanced System Settings"". On XP, Google search for how to change your system path, because I can't quite remember where things were in XP.    3: In the Advanced tab, you'll see a button for ""Environment Variables"". Click it.    4: In the upper section of that new window, you should see something like ""User Variables for [your username]"". Scroll through to find the one called ""PATH"".    5: Highlight the entry for ""PATH"" and click ""Edit..."".    6: You'll get a too-small text box that has a field on the top for ""Variable Name"" and a field under it for ""Variable Value"". Put your cursor into the ""Variable Value"" field and hit the [End] key so you know you're not inserting text in the middle of another entry. If you push the right arrow key it should not scroll.    7: Add a semicolon [;] to separate your new entry from the others. This is the key to the right of the 'L' key, without      pressing Shift. Correct -> ; Incorrect -> :    8: Paste in the path to Steam, which for me on a default-install Windows 7 64 system is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam    9: Press OK, and re-launch Steam so that it gets the new environment variables. (It might work without re-launching, but hey why not.)    10: Run the game normally!-finally, i changed the default setting for the use of integrated or dedicated video card, to integrated (mine is Intel HD4000).After all this passages and a system reboot, now the game starts. I don't know exactly if only one or more together of the above solutions was the key, but i know that if you do all of that, the game will start. Try one after another.			"

												It's a pretty solid game. It's a slow turn based RTS(if that makes sense). The combat itself isn't turn based and is played as an RTS which is a lot of fun. One of my favorite games hands down. It can get a bit buggy at times depending on your system. I had problems for a little bit on an older system, but they cleared up once I upgraded. People with older systems beware for freezing and lock ups.			"

												This game takes way too long and is far too much of a time investment. If anyone thought that Civilization was bad, this game is even more time intensive. Couple that with excessive micro management. Rare that it is a game that has too much depth with its gameplay to the point where large empires and intense battles are almost unplayble. Too many things going at once at any given time. To top it off, steep learning curve and unforgiving difficulty. This game is for the hardcore PC gamers, anyone else would not enjoy this game.			"

In this game your goal is to rule all of the Roman Empire including Rome itself. In order to accomplish this you must expand your factions power base and do missions for the senate to increase your popularity with the Plebians (Peasant people).

Although the graphics are a bit outdated, it still has a great amount of gameplay. This game gives off some good vibes man.			"

												It's the 5th turn in a row that a full stack of Egyptian troops has besieged me in North Africa. After 4 successive sieges without being able to retrain a single unit, the garrison is looking a little f*****. The battle begins, in true defensive siege fashion, every unit is on a chokepoint just next to the centre, i skip the part where the enemy ai knocks down my walls and spends 10mins getting his troops in the city. The panicky advisor screams 'The Walls are down!' ...jeez, calm down mate, it's not over yet. A couple thousand infantry and just under 100 chariots (god, you learn to hate those things) come barreling down the main 'road' towards my town centre, 5mins of carefully stacking my units just right pay off here, most of the chariots bounce off my block of 500 or so legionaries, but, wtf is this!?!?! there is one unit just sat on my town square, they oblige my worst fear and abruptly charge into my neatly packed lines, facing the other direction. What unfolds is a tense fight to the death where i am powerless to help my troops as they are mown down by the chariots, followed closely by infanty, a tense meat grinder, both armies simply melting away in moments...utntil one heroic legionary standard bearer decides to stab the enemy commander in the face, despite hiom being on a chariot. This superhuman feat results in a mass rout...my infantry is too tired to consider a pursuit. I end the battle. The world map loads up, 5 armies down, 8 more to go. Declaring war of Egypt was a terrible idea... (This hasn't beein much of a review, but it simply shows the beautiful anecdotal content this game creates, despite being made in 2004, it still easily holds up to modern gamin, i considered it a benchmark for Rome 2, and found Rome 2 to be lacking...again, proving that this game was insanely ahead of it's time. Would utterly reccommend, one campaign will easily sustain you for 50-100 hours. Enjoy! "

												  I was never a strategy gamer.  I always played Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, God of War, and so on and was reluctant to ever play a strategy game.  The few games that I did play which were strategy were Halo Wars and Endwar and both were not my cup of tea.  The execution and view of them were not of my taste.  It was games like this that deterred me from the strategy genre for many years, until my sophomore year of high school.  I was watching a History video in class about Spartacus' rebellion and recognized footage used in the documentary that was obviously lifted from a game.  I knew for some reason that it had to be Rome: Total War.  I don't know what it was, but I just felt the impetus to buy it.  As luck would have it, it was on sale for a dollar on Steam (with Alexander included).  I came into it thinking it would just offer the same as any other strategy game.  Was I ever wrong.   I have an exceptional ability to tell whether a game is good or not and my misjudgement of Rome was rather monumental.  Unlike many strategy games which are either turn based or real time, Rome: Total War was a mixture of both. There is a campagin map which is turn based-driven where the player can move armies, spies, assassins, diplomats, and ships.  There are a number of cities which are capitals to regions that the player can come to control by conquering the city.  There is a little depth with the utilization of resources for income for the faction the player controls.  Players can also spy on other factions' settlements, take part in diplomacy with either leaders or other diplomats, assassinate individuals, or blockade ports to cities.  The campaign map is far from static between turns.     Nevertheless, the charm of Rome is not the campaign map but the battle map.  This is by far the best part of any total war game for me.  I am glad that I played Rome: Total War before any other strategy game because I would have missed out on the dynamic battles which the player get to partake in.  There are basically three flavors of battle:  siege, field, and ambush.  Battles range from besieging cities to fighting in other locals on the campaign map.  If an army is position in a forest, it has the ability to ambush an army.  This is a game changer for it could result in a force of fewer soldiers to defeat a whole legion of the Roman Empire.  The normal battles in the diverse terrains of Rome: Total War are a spectacle to be witnesses.  The player has the ability to either decimate an enemy army or survive the onslaught and exxecute a brilliant last stand.  Fans of ancient warfare and 300 will most definitely enjoy Rome in this regard.  Sieges offer a different style of play.  Siege operate both on the campaign and battle maps.  The player can create multiple siege weapons and assault the city he or she besieges after blockading the city for a number of turns.  Having units scaling the walls of a city or busting through a gate is satisfying.  The most enjoyable part of battles (and from one source I read it seems to be a valid claim) is when two battle lines collide.  The player feels the impact and the game is made just that much better for witnessing such a spectacle.   As with any game there are a few weak points.  For example, naval battles are nonexistent and the player can only approach each naval confrontation with a auto-resolve action.  It really takes away from the game.  Also, the game is not historically accurate to any extent.  Various historical events, save for the Marian reforms and various natural disasters, have no real effect on gameplay.  Also, the AI of other factions is not the greatest.  You'll partake in many battles where you'll be wondering if the AI was really trying or not.  Also, there is the issue that two factions, the Britons and Egyptians, are just overpowering and end up conquering half of the map by mid-game.  It does provide a challenge but it is really annoyting when they eliminate most other factions before you get to meet them; i. e. Parthia.  As a matter of fact, the only time I got to fight the Parthians was when I was playing as the Seleucids.  Another big failing of the game is the monopoly on unit advancement and power that Roman Factions have.  There are basically four Roman factions.  This means that no matter how you play the game, by the latest turns, the whole world will be ruled by Romans.  Again, this takes away the ability of the player to fight a diverse multitude of enemy types.  Exacerbating the issue is the Marian reforms effect on the Roman faction.  It basically turns all of the units into damage sponges.  This would have been okay if other factions were able to advance in such a faction but that isn't the case.  The most sad case is Gaul.  Gaul can get most of its highest level units before the Marian reforms take place.  However, that is only because it has fewer unit choices than the Roman, Carthage, and Seleucid factions.  I understand that it may have been made this way to bolster faction diversity but nevertheless it breaks gameplay for Gaul.  Now with all these problems considered, I now bring to light the most exciting part about Rome: Total War: the mods.  There are so many good mods out there.  Note, these go well beyond a few stat changes and skins for units.  There are overhauls, historical mods, fantasy mods, etc.  Among the most prominent are Europa Barbarorum (a history buff's mod), Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥ (a Roman buff's mod), Fourth Age: Total War (a Tolken buff's mod), and Terrae Expugnandae (a truly interesting mod).  There is even a Napoleonic era mod with actual units that use rifles.  The modding community is similar to that of Skyrim in that mods are available at many hubs dedicated to mods.  The ability to use mods in Rome just makes that dollar purchase that more worth it.   Rome: Total War is one of those quintessential games that needs to be played by everyone that has a PC.  It encompasses many aspects of strategy games and does not fail to deliever on the ancient Mediterranean theme.  You'll scream yells of excitement and aggravation as you play it.  The replayability is astronomical, especially with the use of mods.  I currently have a total of 544 hours of gameplay logged by Steam.  However, I've see numbers as high as 1000.  If you buy this game, I guarantee that you won't regret it.  The show that Rome puts on is worth the price of admission.			"

												Ah, Rome. I never played it at launch or for years after the fact, but it was always on my friends computer. Which he was of course one of those little wank-jobs that always showed off his♥♥♥♥♥♥but never shared it. No, about 2012 was really the first time I got to play R:TW, my first TW title being Medieval 2. Nowadays, people often say just get EB or any of the number of great mods. However, we're talking about Rome here, the base game as presented on Steam.First off, with this purchase you get both Rome 1 (which follows Roman history from before the first Punic War to the early Imperial age) and the expansion Barbarian Invasion (which follows, of course, the invasions of barbarian tribes during the decline of the Roman empire). You don't receive the expansion Alexander (the campaigns of Alexander the Great) but of all the Rome expansions- Alexander is often regarded as the poorest by both critics and fans.Rome 1 provides all the basics of a TW title. A campaign map where you conquer a part of the world. A skirmish game-mode where you fight the AI in a battle of choice. And Multiplayer (Now patched for steamworks as of 2014). Barbarian Invasion supplies the same package.Within the Campaign Map you choose one of three Roman Families at first. This is where I start to have some gripes with Rome. For one, you have to conquer the other factions to unlock them in the grand campaign. Two, even if you just edit the .ini files to unlock them, the campaign is heavily focused on Rome. They get the most units, the most mechanics, the most events, and the most progression. While it's perfectly possible to enjoy playing the underpowered Gauls, I find these other factions to be relatively abandoned by CA. Some factions feel relatively the same, such as the Gauls and Germans, with only minor unit variations to give some feel to them.  Also of note is that some factions are simply over-powered beyond conceivable belief. Units such as Rome's Urban Cohorts are just horrifying when placed against the AI. This can make Rome somewhat of a snooze-fest once the Marius Reforms activates and you start to get the best of the Roman crop. Other factions such as Gaul have laughably garbage infantry for the most part. While some argue historical accuracy, I find it harms the game balance and the ultimate enjoyment available. But a discussion on Rome's balance is way beyond the scope of this review, suffice it to say, Rome is unbalanced- but it rarely matters in single player.If however you only care for Rome, then RTW is for you. Each of the three families starts with an 'obvious' foe and paths of expansion. The Senate functions as a uniting force, rewarding you for following orders, showing disapproval when you fail. The whole game is built around your family as you grow both your empire and your influence. The game provides some great role-play as you follow the Senate's orders, checking to see if the masses or the patricians prefer you. As you progress, so will your power- inevitably enraging the Senate. It's moments like these where the campaign starts to shine. While I won't spoiler where that ultimately leads to, it justifies the slow start to the Imperial campaign.Speaking of the campaigning, the conquest of towns is fought on the battle map. Here you command your army, including your general if he's there, and engage the enemy. This is where the meat of the game is, and here where Total War makes its name. The battles are some of the fastest in the series, with units moving rapidly and viciously. Veteran units can stomp multiple newbie corps single-handedly. A single cavalry charge can lead to a rapid route. All this occurs to the excellent soundtrack of Jeff van Dyck and combat mechanics that (mostly) stand the test of time.I have a gripes here when compared to the later Total War games. For one, field battles (where units meet with no city or the like nearby) are unfortunately not too common in the later stages of the Campaign. This is due to the AI choosing the hide in cities. Due to this, you get to meet the siege battles of Rome- which are terrible. I'm not going to dance around this issue, siege battles are awful. The path finding of your units is all sorts of agony, and it only gets worse if you fight civilized nations that have large, built-up cities. You can have entire units enter into embarrassing formations where a handful of men are trying to take down a hoplite wall. It's funny, but it's hell. Siege battles can be ignored due to the great auto-resolve system Rome has, which can be used for field battles too.Unfortunately, I have issues with unit path-finding in general. Cavalry especially is very cumbersome compared to later titles. You will just have to get used with Cav occasionally ignoring your orders and charging head-long into spear-walls instead of between that wide-gap in the line. Also, units randomly charging other units instead of the ones you ordered them to is also common- this includes cav. It makes the control feel archaic, and from what I've researched it just seems to be a bug with the formations. It's annoying and often makes me just go towards Medieval 2 and download a Rome mod (EB2, I'm forever hyped). It isn't game-breaking since the AI is just...Meet CA's AI, from Rome to Rome 2 you're going to be playing with him. He's mentally insane, tuned seemingly for players that have no clue about formation tactics. The moment you figure out strategy, is the moment you realize that the AI is helplessly innocent, inept, incapable of learning, a terrible judge in terrain choice, a terrible flanker, and perhaps suicidal to boot. He's come in many different flavors- but really only modders seem capable of making him remotely competent. Increasing the difficulty will not make him smarter, only gives him a boost in unit stats. For a newbie, he's a good first opponent for casual player, but he won't teach you anything.What is not a flaw of the series is its presentation. Rome's simplistic art direction may have aged polygonal graphics but it still holds up relatively well, appearing distinguished and fluid despite being a game from 2004. It's a standard that's been kept by just about every title. The music, which I've only mentioned once, is some of the best in the series, bringing a lot of those aged graphics to life with broad stroke of tunes. Even the voice-acting has some charm, in the hammy sense.But we're not done, BI rounds out our package by being ♥♥♥♥ing painful. It's a campaign for barbarian lovers giving great variety to the barbars while still making Rome a fun faction. Notably a bit more balanced in the campaign the Western Rome campaign is one of the hardest challenges in TW history. It's meant only for series vets, even then it's infamous for the horror it gives. My personal opinion of it is that it's hard in the arbitrary sense, with unrest and religion stacking the deck on you. The AI isn't any smart notably (can land units by sea if the stars align). Most of the difficulty comes from rebellions, but the various barbarian tribes declaring war on you adds some fun. This campaign is historically inaccurate in it's portrayal of what troubled Rome. This is mostly due to the engine being incapable of modeling certain things. Historical inaccuracy is just a common thing in TW as it is- but I'm someone capable of ignoring this in favor of fun. BI besides the difficulty, is a neat addition to Rome and where I say barbarian lovers should go in lieu of the RTW.Still, RTW offers a great package for TW newbs. Introducing you to the series with a game that still holds up, with great modding potential. For the gripes I have, RTW is still a great game. If you have to choose a TW, go with an era that interests you most. All of them have pros and cons. Between Rome 1 and 2? You get a complete product with R1 that is fully patched and 'done'. No dlcs, no patches ruining your mods, same era.  "

												Still the best  Total War Game  in my opinion.The combat has a realistic feel to it that the other titles just dont have.Despite the shortcomings of the battle and campaign AI and some pathfinding glitches i find it the most immersive Total War game,for instance your generals seem to develop in way that gets you thinking,-`wow he`s good`.The other advantage it has is that there are many professional quality mods out there like EB,RS and RTR to name just three.Finally you dont need a super gaming rig to play it.

												Perhaps one of the best games that I have played, ever. I personally perferred the multiplayer because I enjoyed just setting up an army and going head to head with other people. I have many great memories from these battles because the gameplay is really good. Rome: Total War was definitely a game ahead of its time and still is in my opinion a great game. Playing the multiplayer, you will accrue MANY memorable moments, and the recording feature at the end of each match allows you to relive those memories at another time. You will have battles where you become proud with your decisions and then you will have other games where you wonder ""How in the world did I just do THAT bad?"" This is a game in which you will feel as if you are the general on the battlefield: sometimes the one who would come home back to Rome with a Triumph, or the one utterly humiliated by some Barbarian people.

This game can bring you that dream of seeing hand to hand combat in close quarters. If you are the kind of person that loves war but using only using weapons such as spears and swords and arrows then this game is the one for you as you can create armies, conquer cities and eventually be the leader of Europe.

												This is quite possibly one of the best older games, besides stuff like Oblivion and Fallouts 1-3. It was released in 2004 or so, so the graphics arent all that impressive, but you can run it smoothly on anything save a toaster. Depending on the kind of toaster, it might even work. The gameplay is pretty much like the other Total War games: Manage cities, raise armies, do some diplomacy,some stabbing, wage some war. The brilliance comes in the tactical depth of the buildings, which is strange as you dont actually build them where you want, you just tell them to and it builds. Build a Temple of Ceres in your nice little town to grow it into a metropolis quickly, but beware of overgrowth. Essentially, enemy armies are not the only problem that can horribly screw up your faction. Speaking of factions, there are quite a few to play. the 3 Roman factions are playable from the start, but 9 or so others become available after you win with one of them. Winning is determined, not by killing off everyone else, but either A. capturing 15 settlements including Rome and outlasting/murdering a few factions, or B. holding 50 settlements and Rome. The few mods available are all really well made, with support up until at least last year. I forgot to mention the tactical battle mode, which is quite glorious. Strategy is key there. Send in the wardogs to rout the peasants, and mop up with cavalry, send spearmen to kill cavalry, etc. Theres a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock kind of balance here.Anyways, its 10 bucks, includes 2 games, and has neigh infinite replayablity. Buy.			"

When this game came out some years ago it changed the gaming industy. The content and wastness of the game was shocking! To this day it is still in my opinion the best game out there! If you like the total war series or history/romans i recomend you to buy this game. i just now got the game on steam and had about 500 hours of gameplay before that. when i now played the game for some hours i got a little tear in the corner of my eye. I can not wait to experience the world of Rome total war again!15 points out of ten!!!			"

												This game was great 9 years ago and it is still great today. The campaign is very in-depth and it keeps you wanting to take just one more settlement before you save and quit. There's something very rewarding about building your measly little armies up from scratch and over time watching them become the dominant powerhouses that steamroll everything in their path. The diplomacy can be frustrating at times and the Senate will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Always wanting you to blockade this port and take that city within X amount of moves. Then when you ask them for some help they're like, ""Um, no."" That's ok - when you're strong enough you can take them out too and run things how you like. Overall, it is by far one of the best RTS games ever and if you have that craving for war tactics like I do, this is the one for you.			"

												As a series, Total War has almost carved out its own sub-genre within the RTS genre. Each game effectively combines the depth of a grand strategy game, with the more direct strategic warfare of a real-time strategy game. The original Medieval and Shogun games were well received and popular, but Rome took the series to another level. The visuals saw a significant upgrade from the previous title, and in my opinion they still hold up pretty well even today. Perhaps the most revolutionary change in Rome: Total war is the era it is set in. Set during the expansion of the Roman Republic, there is a fantastic amount of variety in terms of factions. You start with the ability to play as one of three different Roman factions based on powerful patrician families, and you unlock new factions to play as by defeating them completely and removing them from the map. Personally, I don't like the separation of Rome into three different factions and would have preferred one faction, it feels like you are forced to expand into a particular direction; however this can be fixed by simply playing one of the mods that have a single Roman faction. As I said though, the variety provided by the factions is great. For example: the Romans focus on organisation and their poweful heavy infantry, but have to keep the senate and the other Roman families in mind; the Greeks have excellent phalanx infantry and skirmishers, but are vulnerable due to being spread out across the map; and the Parthians have their deadly combination of horse archers and cataphracts, but have limited expansion options due to being positioned at the eastern edge of the map. To contrast, Medieval II for example doesn't have this level of diversity simply because the fighting styles during that era were much more similar across the continent. The battles are extremely satisfying; as has come to be expected of the Total War series, though balancing between units is definitely an issue that seems to be persistent in the series. The campaign map gameplay has fantastic depth, so much so that you can often play for hours without having a battle and still be satisfied. The game's soundtrack is excellent; possibly the best in the series, and it really adds to the intensity of the battles.Though the vanilla game is amazing, the wealth of mods available to this game make it even better in various ways. There are a number of large scale total conversion mods but I have found that if you want the ultimate Rome: Total War experience you have two choices: Europa Barbarorum, or Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥ II. Europa Barbarorum focuses on making sure everything is as authentic and historically accurate as possible,especially the barbarian factions that are somewhat neglected in the vanilla game. The campaign map is considerably larger, going as far south as southern Arabia, and as far east as India, and the roster of factions is extensive. However, the insane level of depth can be intimidating for some players. On the other hand, Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥ II occupies the middle ground between the vanilla game and Europa Barbarorum. Whereas Europa Barbarorum pays particular attention to the barbarians, Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥ focuses on fleshing out Rome itself. The mod adds a new system that adds a variety of Roman legions that each have a unique look and feel to them, and this really adds to the authenticity of the mod. There are plenty of new factions, and all the factions look and feel very unique. Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥ II also looks much, much nicer, as the graphics have been improved a great deal on both the campaign map and battle maps; it looks about as good as Medieval II: Total War. Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥ is only silghtly more complex than the vanilla game too, so it shouldn't be as intimidating as Europa Barbarorum. I wouldn't normally talk too much about mods in a review, but I honestly think that the optimal way to play this game is through one of these mods, as they improve almost everything.Even without modifications, Rome: Total War is a phenomenal game. If you enjoy real-time strategies but want a bit more depth to the strategy then this game should be just what you are looking for. 9/10Essential for Total War fans.			"

												This game is... quoting the great words of Nacho, ""es da best"". The story, which consists of AI vs Player, in which it's map based domination, like Risk, and RT (Real-time) battles. So the units, and such are ACTUALLY moving, and responding to environment (rocks, trees, units, enemies and rivers). The story is relatively simple. Conquer what the game wants you to conquer (on fast campaign) or conquer like... 50? countries/cities on Long Campaign. The music in the game, it's alright. It's the kind of music you'd hear in a Roman Era genre. Orchestra-ish, theatrical-ish. AI, are based on difficulty. Hard difficulty? good luck. anything lower than that, is manageable. Multiplayer, being very close, to near death (no more people playing) but i constantly play this game with friends regardless. Take the time, to research this game, if wanting to buy. you might like Empire: Total War, or even the newer Total War. In all aspects the game is:AI: 8/10Story/singleplayer: 9/10Gameplay/battle: 10/10Menus/GUI: 10/10Multiplayer: 6/10 (not a lot of players, relatively buggy.Unit balance: 9/10Music: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Controls: 9/10Overall: 10/10 i really do enjoy this game, even though i'm not a big RTS fan.

												My very first Total War game and it really hooked me.  One of my favorite things to do early game was just to create an entire army of peasants.  You haven't seen hell until you see over 3000 peasants trying to get through a gate all at once.  It was glorious and it made trained soldiers flee in terror just because of the sheer size of my host.  Unfortunately that tactic only works in the early game but it's fun to watch. I would build huge walls and watch as my archers tore apart the incoming troops.I would read about the buildings and units that I built and their historical context and I ended up learning a lot about it. I would deal with the ""senate"". I would master trade. It was all a surreal experience. I played this game so much that I scored a 100 on my europe geography test without any other use of materials. In short, buy this.			"

But at least i reclaimed a lot of land off of the romans. 10/10 would try to defeat all of rome instead of half. If your in to rome or germanic tribe or nordic history i recommend you get this game!			"

												I haven't played much Shogun 2, but compared to the rest of the series, this is my favorite TW game.  Everything seems to be in balance.  Take your favorite nation available and proceed to conquer the ancient world.  The strategic part of the game is not as skin deep as some would have you believe.  You need to be careful with your economy and the morale of the people to survive much.  The battles are much fun toplay, even though there are a couple of points where you can (but you shouldn't) abuse AI glitches.  The use of special characters is not as annoying as in the Medieval series, where it becomes an annoyance more than fun part of the game.  Great game and eagerly await for a sequel/remake of it some time in the future.			"

Its your standard Total War game stratigic unit combat on the battlefield with a turn based campain map. To start with it can be a bit dull, playing as a roman faction you just walk over all other factions until you get to the meatgrinder Roman vs Roman the battle suddenly become difficult (ish) well a bit harder anyway and it becomes a hole lot more fun to play.

												this is the best total war game of all time the first total war was really good but had a tendency once you owned 80% of the map to have everything you own revolt on you. this game is the best no crashing issues to speak of like the new total war games starting with empire total war. the tactics are great because useing nothing but cavalry you can beat an army of spearmen by useing tactics such as pincering or thricing. but overall this game has the diplomatic side to it as well as the Kill everything in site game. this is one of the best total war games and if your smart even as carthage you can take out the senet just look at my screen shots of this game i killed them with half the troops just useing pionen iberian infantry and cavalry. i highly recomend it over all the other total war games as being the best built. if you get it its better than rome total war II XD have fun and enjoy			"

They depict those who ride atop a horse in this game as an unkillable demigod with the power of a thousand suns at their disposal, when they charge into some poor unknowing enemy unit they simply dissapear in a shower of pink mist, leaving on Hiroshima style shadows imprinted on the ground. Don't ever build any foot units or archers, even if you need to scale a wall with ladders or a siege tower, just let the horses run up it (trust me they can if you give them enough hay). An amazing horse-based game, would not reccommend playing if you are a pig however.			"

												I came, I saw, I conquered. Those words mean a lot in this game. When i saw this game in my local MVC shop before it closed down nearly 11 years ago. I wasn't sure if i would enjoy it. I loved games which involve empire building and controlling large armies on the battlefield like the good old AOE series. Although this game doesn't lead on the same path as AOE, it brings a lot more entertainment with empire building and controlling vast armies on battle map. This game, like a few others are the types of games that i could play for ages. They are my golden games to which i will never sell or never forget. Each faction has a strength or weakness, but it also depends on which units and buildings you create. It is up to you and you alone to survive. Its not a simple hit and run game where you can do anything you want and get away with it. Each choice, move and final act you make will to a certain point have an impact on your empire and your armies. You will never know who will betray you, attack you or ask for an alliance. The battlefields are more or less the same, once the battle begins, its fate, skill and intelligence that helps you win and leads you to world domination. Although the game will have its moments be it bugs, crashes or simple copy and paste. If you ever play the game on the hardest difficulty, the feeling of victory after an hour+ long battle is beyond satisfying. The battle music is perfect, the power and awesomeness before battle and the clash between your army and the computer AI is just as good. Many factions do have the same units and it can be rather annoying when facing the Roman's, but it can also be a wonderful challenge, but again, that all depends on the choices you make because one wrong more and that's it, everything could come to an end.

												Let me start off by saying Rome is one of my favorite strategy games of all time. I also consider it being the game that got me into strategy/war games. However the Steam version is a very bad port. I can run the cd version perfectly fine on my computer but the Steam version lags considerably. The battles lag a little and the world map lags a considerable amount. I can run Empire and Napoleon on high for virtually no lag at all. Apparently the game used to run fine but CA added a patch that made the game into the state that it is now. CA seems to not be trying to fix the issue either. In conclusion, should you get Total War Rome? YES, but get the cd version instead. The game still gets a reccomendation for being a great game.			"

												It's a travesty that this game has everything but competent AI. It becomes tiredly repetitive once you understand how the computer reacts to your army. And that's tragic because the rest of the game is brilliant in all the right ways, including the most engaging titular campaign in the entire franchise.			"

												I don't know about the rest of you gamers, but this game is definately one of my instant favorites. Since I was little, I wanted this game, but I never had the mental capacity to find out what it was called. This is the first game I have in the total war series, and one of the best things about it is the fact it can run on my horrible laptop. Any person who loves strategy or just straight up wants to see two massive armies clash, this is your game.			"

												Let me just start by saying I love strategy games. This game in particular was on sale for only $3 when I bought it; Lucky me. I can never get enough of this game. It makes my heart warm and happy as I send my men to annhilate the enemy army. Let's face it, if you choose the Julii campaign you're going to completely wreck the other houses. As you wave your flag across Europe, into the territories of what we now know of as France and Germany everyone will be kneeling down to pleasure you with their saliva and a certain body part. I must say, this game will consume your social life and teach you everything you need to know about the Roman times from 235 AD to at least 285 AD. Hell, you could even make the Western Empire in this game to your will. The gameplay of this game (especially during battles) is  SO ADDICTING that it's scary. I have played one session of this game for 24 hours straight out of my gameplay time. I would definately recommend buying this game, just be warned the game itself may give you extreme fatigue to where you'll pass out in the middle of a battle (trust me, I would know). Definately play the game without hurting your health. And just pirate the sequal to this game ""Rome: Total War 2"" since the original will always be the best one.			"

												Classic PC strategy game that still is amazing. The hours I have on this are off because I used to own this on disc, where I played numerous hours. I bought the Steam version due to the fact that GameSpy shut down. Now to the actual review.Whether you're a history buff, a Risk player, and/or a real time stategy game person, this game is for you. You can play historical battles, either online or offline. You can play the single player campaign very similar to Risk. However, the main attaction of this game are the real time battles, where you command armies in a battle to create your own fights, or to recreate/simulate real fights. It does require very good internet, especially considering the age of this game, which I would say is the only downside. Regardless, this game is a classic game that anyone should pick up to enjoy.

												The first truly 3D Total War game.Gone is the Risk-style map, replaced with a completely new strategic map style, that will be continuosly improved on in future Total War games. Sadly, this also means that if you played later games from the series, you'll notice some missing/outdated functions. This is also, for a game based on real history, the least accurate game in the series. The Imperial Campaign begins in 270 BC. The Roman faction is divided into three, in a clumsy attempt to simulate the incoming Roman Civil War. And many factions have either fantastical units (ex: Arcanii) or are condensed (ex: all the Galic tribes are put together as one factions). It's also the most 'Hollywood history' styled game in the entire series - the Egyptain faction looks like straight out of 'The Ten Commandments', even though at that time in history they were more Greek than Egyptian.So why am I recommending this game?Because of the fantastical mod support, that fixes and adds anything you can imagine. This game, and M2TW, are the most mod friendly Total War games. The mod community around them is why people return to play these games even today.Along with the original Rome: Total War, this collection also includes Barbarian Invasion, an expansion that moves the date to late antiquity, and this time it is a much more historically faithful representation of the Great Migrations period.

												Although this game is almost 11 years old, I find that it is the best in the Total War series. The music is great, although few in tracks. The gameplay is responsive and smooth, easy to navigate. Overall, I have no bad memories of this game and have invested many hours of my life into it. WHen I first got this game, I was probably five or six. My dog originaly snapped it in two... you can imagine the sorrow I felt.  :( but now I have it again!I recomend this game as a great introduction to the series; it is easy enough for beginners, but can also be quite challenging. Unlike its sequel, you can expect NO GLITCHES! I promise it won't leave a bad taste in you mouth.			"

												I played this for thousands of hours as a kid. It is, hands down, one of the best PC games all time. I'd put it in the top 5 (if not #1).You will sit down and before you know it 12 hours has passed. It's incredibly indepth and challenges you to think strategically. The Very Hard campaign will make you challenge your wits to no end, and as you conquer more fractions you unlock more to play as with unique units and building paths. This game is perfect and deserves a 100/100 on meta critic. The best RTS of all time without a doubt. The only reason Rome II: Total war didn't do so well is because it had to live up to this.Buy it.			"

												This game was a classic, yet if you do not already own it, it is now more trouble than it is worth.  As someone who has put many hours into this game (owning it on CD long before I bought it again for steam) I have to say its many bugs combined with its age mean it no longer the game it once was.You may boot it up and find yourself enjoying it, only to discover any one of many game breaking bugs.  These bugs are older than many small children and most have no known solution.  I myself have had trouble with CTDs upon ending my turn, graphical glitches, freezes deep into epic battles and others.  The one that sent me over the edge involved a bug where you can not attack your enemies but they can attack you.  It happens after a special event late in the game and there is no remedy.While this game is a classic and was great in its time, it has not kept up with software advancements and I assume the problems will only pile up over time.  Unless your an anthropologist interested in old relics, don't bother with this game any longer.  I say this as a fan, rest in peace old friend.			"

												One of the best games of all time. If you like strategy, buy the game. If you like the Roman period, buy the game. If you like reliving classics, buy the game. If you like watching sizzling bacon terrify elephants, buy the game. Despite what my steam log says I played this game way before steam was a thing (as many other people have) and I am glad it hasn't dug out the records for hours played because I would realise how much of my time I could have spent doing something more useful. It's certainly not wasted time though as almost no other game can recreate the fun of fighting over a stupid bridge in the middle of Germany or running around the map trying to catch skirmishers on multiplayer. Gameplay is still solid after 11 years, graphics aren't great but they do the job in a better way later titles have, you make your own story and the multiplayer is still fun. The community is almost gone and I miss the days were multiple clan battle were seen on the friendly server. Overall though I r8 M80/10 because the game is insanely good. Although newer systems do drop framerate a bit and I have had to have worse settings than my old computer. Even so the game is still one of the top TW and strategy titles to date. Buy this game.			"

A small but very complete game, running on some of the old mid-2000 computers. This game is flawless.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic.  It's singleplayer will challenge anyone who isn't already a pro to the Total War franchise.  I found it to be great fun, and if you have a friend to play with, it's even better.  I personally wouldn't reccomend this over any other Total War game, as Medieval II is much more worth the buy.  If you're more specifically looking for a Roman Total War game, it'd be better to buy Atilla or Rome II if your PC can handle it.			"

												Of course I am going to sound biased when I say this but this honestly is one of the best, if not, THEE BEST strategy game ever made. Bought this when I was a prepubescent child and I made so many memories with it then and still do today. Gameplay is fantastic, both campaign and RTS. And the music to this day still gives me these chills and adrenaline rushes when playing a battle. It's very unfortunate that its successor Rome 2 didn't live up to how brilliant the first one was. Especially considering this most likely is the best of all the Total Wars with Shogun 2 being a very close exception. Not to mention it pretty much laid out the gameplay formula for every Total War game ever since (look up its predecessors and their gameplay and you’ll understand lol). It deserves the best because it is, well, the best! And yeah, the game is over a decade old but that hasn’t stopped me from ever playing it. And if you can find a way to still play multiplayer games with friends. Do it. It’s ridiculously fun.			"

												Let me start off by saying Rome is one of my favorite strategy games of all time. I also consider it being the game that got me into strategy/war games. However the Steam version is a very bad port. I can run the cd version perfectly fine on my computer but the Steam version lags considerably. The battles lag a little and the world map lags a considerable amount. I can run Empire and Napoleon on high for virtually no lag at all. Apparently the game used to run fine but CA added a patch that made the game into the state that it is now. CA seems to not be trying to fix the issue either. In conclusion, should you get Total War Rome? YES, but get the cd version instead. The game still gets a reccomendation for being a great game.			"

Some things that are kind of annoying are the FPS drops in large night-time battles, moving camera fast on campaign map, and the game not letting you Alt+Tab back into the game if you tab out.  Oh, and the AI can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you are besieged and use your garrisoned troops to attack the attackers before ending the turn.Aside from that, there's a lot of depth to this game that surpasses Rome 2 in many ways.

												So last night....I stayed up until midnight, preparing to attack Rome, three full stack armies, two of them coming from the North, full of Urban Cohorts and the most elite troops I could get. One coming from the sea to the west, a fodder army of lesser troops. The turn before I plan on attack, SPQR denounces mine and the other three houses. Instant Civil War, four or five of my settlements beseiged by the other two houses, but I press on. First, my fodder army lands, 2-3k of my troops against two full stacks of SPQR elite troops, some 5-6k. I manage 681 kills to their complete annihlation of my army. SPQR forces have HUGE buffs. But it works, one of their armies is too far away from their capital to provide back up, so I lay siege. As soon as my towers are built, I assault the city. Walls so large they fill the entire screen, my onagers unable to penetrate them. The SPQR has less than a thousand men garrisoned in the city, but my reinforcements are delayed, they may not make it to the battle. With the enemies army marching at us from the other side of the city I quickly charge the walls. Sending my top units up the towers, I lose a thousand men, just trying to take the walls that less than four hundred defended. I rush a company of men to the other gate, to prevent enemy reinforcements from entering the city, they get there just in time. Now they must use my siege towers, I turn my onagers against them, destroying my own siege towers. But I haven't the ammo, one remains. With my battered and half killed army, I march to the city center, leaving only one unit back to defend the walls, along with my archers positioned along the enemy's approach. Half of my forces retreat from the city center as soon as combat ensues. The other half fighting bravely, but slowly losing. The enemy army reaching my tower, and then, reinforcements, my own. Finally arrived, striking the enemy in the back as they try to clamber up their own walls. I send the calvary and some infantry around to the side gate, attacking the city center from behind. I lose near on a thousand more men fighting the contingent of several hundred in the center, but I take it. Now I must hold it. With the enemy army at my back, attacking the walls my men so valiantly took. My second army charging at them, forcing them up against the walls, ballista's and arrows raining down on them. They begin to break, but so do my men. The might of the SPQR is undeniable, their armor thicker, weapons sharper. Sending the calvary out of the side gate, hitting them in their flank, finally the break. And the city is mine. The SPQR is destroyed, but the war has just begun, now the house Julii must reign supreme over the other two houses, they must be dealt with and swiftly. And with the Britons to my north, I know my victory of Rome will be a spec in comparison to the battles that I must fight to be declared ruler of the Roman Empire, and the world!			"

												It might be old but it is still a very good game. The only problem is that the game is not historically accurate. There's a faction called Spain but it is suppose to be called Iberia. The minor factions like the Illyrians should have been included instead of being part of the rebels. There are alot of good mods to get with game, some improve the game. In honesty you should get this game when it is on sale and also get the Europa Barbarorum Mod with it if you are history fanatic like me			"

												I have sunk over 200 hours of my life into this game, and guess what? Every last one was enjoyable. RTW is my favorite title by Creative Assembly, and my favorite real time strategy game as a direct result. The main thing most people sink hours into is the Imperial Campaign, which can last an upwards of 20 hours per campaign if drawn out. Your goal is simple, conquer 50 territories in the known world, and of course, Rome. The most focus in this mode has obviously been given to the Romans, as they have unique mechanics in the campaign, such as the ever hostile senate, the Civil War, the reforms of Gaius Marius, and so on. This isnt to say the other possible factions are any less far to play, far from it in fact. Playing as Carthage, you have access to mighty war elephants, the Greeks get their Spartans, the Germanians get Bezerkers, everyone has a unique element that mixes up gameplay in a way that forces you to adapt different strategy for each campaign. The AI for battles can either be brilliant, or mind numbingly awful, depending upon the difficulty you set it to. However if you want a real challenge, you are going to have to take your skills online. Despite being a very old title, there still is a good chunk of people playing this online. Most of them are experienced veterans, so dont be too upset if they wipe the floor with you the first couple of battles. The nostalgia runs deep in this game, and for those of you who have never played a Total War game, its probably the best game you can start with. It was GOTY worthy when it came out back then, and compared to RTW2, its a gem every collector should have in their library.			"

												RTW wasn't my first introduction into the real time strategy war/civilization type game, but it was the first that I loved.  The others just didn't do it for me, especially growing up with side scrollers and fighting games.  It's extremely addictive, I mean a whole day can pass by without you doing much of anything, because there's so many things to capture your attention, and a threat around every corner.  It's usually pretty cheap these days, so if you were ever remotely interested in this type of game, I'd highly recommend trying it out.			"

												In 2005, aside from Morrowind there couldn't have been a better game for my to pour hours of my life into. I had just finished a fairly shallow, but interesting intro Roman History course, and I was home for the summer, jobless. My campaigns and expeditions really drew me in, especially the focus on individual characters. Watching as a 16 year old noble started an insane mercenary fueled campaign and grew into a competent commander and ruler was immensely satisfying.The systems in the game all fit together well and provide a fun, if not entirely historically accurate grand strategy game. 10 war elephants out of ten for me.

The combat system with the open landscapes works beutifully and feels like a real battle. Definately get this game if you liked Civ V or enjoy a good strategy game.15 Hours in:Just beat 7 Armies of Gauls with my one army of Selucid warriors. [proof http://imgur.com/aznIG1d] I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.30 Hours in:The campagin is even more fun now that I've put a few hours into it. The different factions with different units make things much more interesting and the Senate's missions really help drive objectives. The campaign really flows and feels like a living civilization. I found myself so deeply involved with this game that 2 hours passed within what felt like 20 minutes.			"

												Don't even think about it; this title is a definite buy.  This was my first RTS, although it is a mix of RTS or Turn-Based, the battles that take place are RTS.  This is my first Total war game ever, so I might not know everything about the franchise, but what i've experienced in the time i've played is amazing.  The graphics are definitely not going to blow you away in todays standards, but back when this was released was very impressive, in my gameplay there was about 2,000 people on the battlefield at once.  Don't get me wrong this game is not perfect, but is pretty close. For example, your troops get stuck way too many times. Also your troops run scared even though you may outnumber them 8:1 and you are dominating them. Those minor errors do not in fact damage the game in any way.  I do have one major problem since this game came out so long ago, my Nvidia can't automatically optimize it for me so it goes kind of slow for me, but maybe that is just me.

Therefore I'm changing this to a positive review as it's really good even in single player.  Also, if a mod outright refuses to work properly on the Steam release, but has an alternate mode that works on the Alexander EXE, you can use that for maximum compatibility, as Alexander hasn't been updated to Steamworks and may very well run some older mods much better.Original review below:Broken by Sega's ""gamespy-ridding"" lan-direct ip removing patching.

												Though I may have few hours on the steam version of Rome, don't be decieved. I have played this game for AT LEAST 100 hours on the disc version. That said, the review. This game is an extremely fun game that can run on just about any budget modern computer on some of its best settings (+ any graphical mods you want to get if your card can run them). It's relatively simple and easy to learn, yet intuitive and the differences are clear when comparing one who is good at the game to one who isnt. The single player Imperial Campaign is a really fun interesting way of playing if you have the time to invest in to it, however there are just quick battles instead if that is what you are looking for. There are challenging historical battles you can do which is also difficult and interesting. And there is also multiplayer if you are looking for that too.			"

												7/10Good game especially if Rome is the only thing you know about history and/or a Roman fanboy. Other than that the game is average for our time. For it's time however it was a masterpiece i rememeber.			"

												Still one of the best strategy games out there. I have had at least 4 copies of RTW on disc since I first got it in 2004 and keep coming back to it. The Steam version feels a little different but worth it.			"

												An oldie but a goodie. At this point this game is a classic, the combat is great and the whole war strategy aspect of it is just superb. I love every moment I've played of it whether I'm looking to use tactics and take out more experienced opponents, or I'm just looking for the mindless slaughter of the weakest link. I whole heartedly recommend this game, it is a great buy and I personally promise you that you will love it.			"

												My personal favorite of all the Total War series, until Rome II comes out. Also i have had this game before steam and have played on and off for nearly 10 yrs. Edit: This game is a must buy if you enjoy RTS or if you have an interest in the battles of antiquity and late antiquity. The graphics are litereally the only ""problem"" with this game besides balancing issues- general units are powerfull. And I say this after putting many hours into RTW 2 it is much better then its predesessor for many reasons-

			Exactly why Rome 2 failed, from battles that are worse in every aspect from the original, to the campaign, which is an orgy of poorly implemented features that cripple the pacing, to the barebones...

												Nothing beats a classic, and Rome: Total War is a classic.  I'm sure there were games that predated it (the original Medieval Total War, right?), but Rome is probably a solid place to start.For the time it came out and its place so early in the franchise, you can't fault it much.  It has all the staples that would appear in the other installations in the franchise, and the balance of story, graphics, and controls make it a fun experience that isn't terribly hard to learn.Anyone who is a fan of tactical games, strategy games, historical games, or even just enjoys playing God for a tiny nation of soldiers should enjoy this game.

												By far one of the most epic strategy games of all time. Now considered the bar for games of its type. One of my all-time favorites.			"
