Early Access Review
Early access review of build 0.47.  Ignore the steam playtime; I bought this outside of steam at 0.3x.It's not often I write a negative review, especially of early access games - either it's too soon to tell, or the game is so bad that Jim Sterling will deal with it.  Maia, though, I want to warn people off, for now.Maia should not be in early access at this time, and it certainly should not have a ticket price of $25.  This is an alpha stage game, with serious, fundamental flaws that need to be worked on before this can be an enjoyable beta experience.Maia is a colony builder, like Spacebase DF9 or Rimworld.  It takes the Towns approach of letting you set tasks and build spaces but not directly control the colonists.  With good AI and balanced priorities this works well; without it, you get issues as with Towns.  Maia is somewhere in between: the AI isn't very good, but there is so little going on in the gameworld that it's just about good enough, unless you do something weird.Graphically I like Maia.  It's got a 1980s styrofoam-and-foil aesthetic, with big-head robots and Space: 1999 jumpsuits.  The graphics are very unpolished, but this game I think qualifies as alpha at this stage, so that will come.The UI is just so bad.  It is clunky, awkward to use, with unintuitive keybindings, an absence of necessary information in the overlay, no easy way to check what your colonists are doing, and an annoying over-sensitivity to screen scrolling when you're trying to get the obnoxious and imprecise mouse cursor over the icons.  Drawing rooms is a chore, which is an issue when that is pretty much the only thing you can currently do in the game.It's also very poorly optimised.  Running on min settings, with a mid-range computer in excess of the recommended specs, I get memory crashes, terrible frame rate issues, and periodic freezing as the game tries to calculate something.  I've spent a lot of time on forums trying to find ways to address these issues at my end, with no luck; I'm not the only person with this experience.  A certain level of poor optimisation is to be expected with early access, but not to the degree where it derails your playing.Development is okay.  I feel like they should be further along than they are at this point.  For over a half a million dollars in funding and a year and a half since the first playable build, it should be further along than this.  I think Maia, Towns, DF9 et al illustrate one central truth about town-management games: they take time to develop.  If you over-promise, you get DF9; if you rush and then run out of hype, you get Folk Tale; if you don't nail the AI, you get Towns.  Dwarf Fortress didn't happen overnight; without having to worry about graphics or platform integration that game took years to get to anything like a quality gaming experience.And that's principally why I am warning against Maia.  For a well-funded game to be charging $25 for an early access build that isn't optimised, isn't visually polished, doesn't have basic features, lacks solid AI, and is without the diversity of content you need for a game in this genre, that's not a good investment.  I accept that an early access game will be content-light, will have areas needing to be polished, but when a colony-manager after this much work still doesn't have basic UI, AI and optimisation sorted out, they are going to have no chance of adding more content without bringing the game crashing down.I want this game to succeed, but they don't need more money, and you don't need the current experience of Maia.  Give them until the end of the year, see where they're at then; they will either have fixed these issues by overhauling basically the core of the game, or it will have gone the way of Folk Tale.  Either way you'll have your answer.			"

Early Access Review
								Do not buy this. I regret Maia more than any other useless, unplayable purchase in the dark history of Early Access. Maia is absolutely beneath what's acceptable to release as an EA game. It does not even meet the minimum bar of quality for paid alphas.As of this updated review, you're still paying for an extremely limited demo sandbox where you can place objects and watch animations happen. The setting can't decide whether it wants to be a realistic simulator (vital statistics on each colonist, food/water/atmosphere required for survival) or a complete joke (giant fuzzy extraterrestrial life). User interface design is not good, and it's difficult to tell what each control does. The current main controls for Maia are a series of badly documented hotkeys. One of the only good new features: you can skip the tutorial now.But if you take one thing away from this review: the bugs are show-stoppingly bad. I've experienced sudden framerate slowdowns on both Mac and PC, as well as crashes-to-desktop for no discernable reason. The colonist and robot AI will get stuck in walls or stand next to piles of rubble on no notice. There appears to be very little QA before each release, and minimal progress in fixing the crash bugs since I wrote my last review in 2013 December.Summer 2015 Update: It still sucks. I'm not even going to sugar-coat this. It crashes and freezes even more than it did last year, and there's still no resource management or objectives to speak of. They literally just added more framerate-drop-inducing wildlife.Maia isn't worth paying for and probably never will be. I used to think something good might come of it eventually, but after more than a year and a half I've lost all hope.Summer 2016 Update: Still pretty unstable. They finally made time to fix a few bugs.			"

Early Access Review
								Don't get me wrong; this is a great game...Or should I say,  WILL  be a great game. As I've seen in many reviews, this game is full of potential, but it is really too early to do anything. There are nearly no features, and progress is slow although on its way.  The price is a well too steep considering how early it is in development. There are plenty of great ideas, it is quite original, and I love sandbox games... but so far I've faced no challenges/purpose to complete tasks (also there are no damned tasks).			"

Early Access Review
								If you like Sci fi Sandboxer games, this might be for you. There are some design kinks that need to get worked out tho, and of course it still requires some content. But for all its worth i give it my approval.Simon, the developer really cares for what his players think about the game and you should totally join their forums as well, to give feedback and get yourself into the process of making this one awesome Sci Fi Game.Original Text:Yeah no more early access games for me. I really love to support Indie game developers (and i did by buying this i guess) But to be fair and honest: This is not even Alpha. This is barely a short demo tops. No menus, no full screen, the game starts right away (by the way those darn messages are WAY too friggin fast!) So in the best interest for this game, which really seems to have potential. Let's wait for late beta i'd say. Do not let your opinion form just right now. By getting this now, you'll probably walk away from it, saying ""what rubbish did i got again?"" (like me). There is just so much missing that would make it an Alpha right now. I really like to see this evolving. But for now my thump remains down. If the game progresses in an acceptable manner i might rewrite this here and lift the thump.			"

								Hard to vote this down -- the concept is great, and the team is clever, and dedicated to the project. One day, this will be an awesome game, but right now -- even as an Alpha -- I honestly feel Maia is too rough, and too early in its development cycle, to appeal to anyone beyond those who are fully committed to the testing and review of something in the earliest of prototypical stages.Another way to put it? I regret spending money on Maia in its current state -- but I expect I'll be glad of the purchase later on in the Alpha development life cycle.  "

								Looks very promising early access game, plays very much like Prison Architect and Dungeon Keeper 2 combined. However, it is still very early early access. Even the most basic stuff worked only half the time, my colonists just disappeared for no reason, and after about 15 minutes, 3 of them got stuck in... well, nothing. If you are one of us suckers who can't resists another game that could be like Dwarf Fortress lite, go ahead and buy this game, but not yet. It's still in early alpha, and while it looks pretty, there's really no game yet.			"

Early Access Review
								Maia shows promise, although in the way of being so little more than a bare-bones engine, that anything is possible in the end. It could be that (judging by the progress speed that makes continental drift seem fast) in half a decade it will evolve into the most amazing colony sim ever. Or not. Who knows?But at the moment, it's NOT a good use of your money. As was said, it pushes the limit of what is acceptable to release as ""early access"". It's just a bare-bones graphics engine, with some minimal and BROKEN animations, a non-functional AI, and no save and reload either, so your progress WILL be lost each time you exit.And by ""non-functional AI"" I don't mean ""might not prioritize right"", but as in ""doesn't even work, or not for long."" Colonist AI routinely craps itself and either stops building anything any more (lucky version) or you just get a colonist going catatonic in the airlock and never moving any more (more usual version.) And when you do get it to work for half an hour, it will prioritize the hilariously wrong thing, like everyone keeping repairing the doors instead of building the air purifier.Now that might be palatable (not really) in a game where you can direct them around, like in The Sims, and the AI only keeps them alive in between. But here you can't direct them, and the WHOLE premise is that they do their own thing, a broken AI just means a broken game.Etc.Really, it has no excuse to be released at this early and dysfunctional stage. It may eventually be worth playing. Save your money for then.Update for 0.44: Upon starting the game, I proceeded to place the workshop and dig a small tunnel to one side, and a 4x4 tile hole there. Partially because you NEED minerals, and partially because I needed somewhere to place the hydroponics bay. I must stress that I wasn't digging some grand ballroom hall, and I was mindful that it has plenty of all rock walls on all sides, because I did read the update notes about earthquakes. When that was about half-way dug, the ceiling promptly collapsed, squashing the only digger robot and two of four colonists, who were there to take minerals.So basically, instead of fixing the existing problems, it just added a random ""*BANG* you're dead!"" event, the hallmark of incompetent game design. Yippee.Well, regardless of how you personally feel about that kind of events, to my mind it just further illustrated the point of why shouldn't you buy a game that's not even in alpha yet: you don't know what you're going to get for your money. The kind of gameplay elements that the final mix will have can just as well be what you like, or what you hate, and there's no way to know which it will be, as there doesn't even seem to be any plan.

Early Access Review
								I just had a look at the 0.49 and regrettably I must say I wouldn't recommend this game. I bought it around 0.47 because it looked so good on paper but here is why you actually shouldn't get it in my opinion, at least in its current state:- the updates have been increasingly rare- the updates that it does get add new functionality that seems random while it doesn't improve the (lack of ) core game play- there is no sense in the game of what you are supposed to be doing - e.g. how much material / food / colonists in total you have. They just added reports on power which is great, but every game like this has an overview window that shows you your resources so that you know what you need to be getting next. That, to me, seems more important than adding weapons, for instance.- there is no sense of why accidents happen - e.g. all my atmosphere generators exploded all at once - I have no idea why! And the colonists don't seem to care, they just walk around. You would expect major panic if something like this happened in the real life (the game is supposed to be a simulation, right?)Before you all start accusing me of not knowing what alpha is - I know very well. I'm a dev myself.In my opinion, the devs here should stop adding more functionality that create more breadth and isntead focus on improving the gamer's experience to create depth. Make a game out of this. Because at the moment, it seems like bunch of functionality stitched together. Give us a reason to play! Experimenting with new features is great, but wears off after you've built everything. The game is not interesting after that.  Give us a sense of what we are doing and why we are doing it!			"

Early Access Review
								I love the idea of this game... it also looks really great. The weather effects are awesome. That being said, I have purchase several games in alpha and beta stages. I have been in invite-only beta tests also. I know what to expect and what not to expect from games in early stages, and this one is terrible. The developer clearly has little idea of what he's doing from a procedural point of view. In the time i've owned this game here's what's happened: several patches have been released, but the big problems haven't been resolved... neat new little content has been added, but with the game unplayable it makes little difference. This game is sure to disappoint over and over again. I waited so long to write this review because I wanted to see if some progress would be made, but it hasn't. The worst part of it is that the developer has had to go off steam (on kickstarter) to continue to raise money. Please save yourself the headache of downloading this game. If you do try to play, here are a few tips.1) Save often. F5 saves and F9 loads... the icons at the top right also save and load, i'll let you try to figure out which is which2) The AI is always getting stuck in stupid loops or just shutting down. This happens every few minutes like clockwork... you must save, exit the game, and restart it to continue playing.3) Things don't update like they should... if you mine ore but can't figure out why it isn't being moved to storage... it's probably AI to blame again... another reload should help.4) Sometimes things stop working inexplicably, If the airlock breaks and cannot be repaired, you must start a new game. some things can be repaired though, so who knows.5) Always place two doors on rooms... if the door breaks and needs repair, but your people are inside of the room, and the guys outside the room are too tired to do it and the door that's broken leads to the sleeping area... they might decide not to repair it and instead die from lack of sleep... leaving the others trapped inside to starve6) Just get in the habit of restarting the game every few minutes7) Don't bother with research, it causes bugs which basically cause the game to crash beyond a certain point... meaning you'll never get past that point without starting yet another new game.8) Use windows 7 or vista, and make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card (and by that I mean have a graphics card that uses newer drivers) The dev doesn't like helping with bugfixing if your computer doesn't use the latest drivers, despite the fact that some older cards (like the ones in my windows 7 machine) have old drivers (even if they are the ""most up to date"" they are still like 2 years old) and that still others (like on my windows 8 acer machine) require the use of special drivers provided by the OEM which may not be the ""latest and greatest"".9) Don't expect too much, this way you won't be disappointed.Edit: still... don't buy this game. It's on sale, but seriously... you wouldn't play it more than 30 minutes, even if it were free.UPDATE: 21 May 2015... I'm not sure how it's even possible, but the game is even worse now than it was before.			"

								Review as of November 24th, version .59 (invasion update), 5 hours of play time:I've had my eye on this game for awhile and decided to take the plunge. However, this game is still in a state where it requires testers more than players. The base gameplay is still too buggy and unbalanced to provide much enjoyment, although I can anticipate having a great deal of fun with Maia when it is further along.I will update this review from time to time as the game develops.

Early Access Review
								***DO NOT BUY THIS GAME***.56 update: Now the game has been updated so it'll work on modern video cards, so the game now runs.. HOWEVER, the game it's self is still unplayable. Colonists will just randomy starve to death even though there is food, livestock will spawn uncontrolalbly if you create a livestock area and cause all of your oxygen to be sucked up (the chickens don't die, but the colonists do). The funny thing is, there's an article from years ago that says the developer knew the chicken spawing rate was insane, but left it as-is because he thought it was amusing. Haha funny, we'er all laughing at a game-breaking bug you never bothered to fix (esp. since now it seems chickens are needed so colonists don't starve). Colonists won't build a door to save their life, quite literally.  Some things which should be automatic aren't (like converting raw materials into usable materials--the smelter isn't automatic, and can't be made to be automatic). Robots still get stuck, although the addition of repar robots is progress in the right direction (if they didn't get stuck).  UI is buggy. I had the tool tips say I was placing a ""Dog: wooof!"" for everything: items, rooms, etc (restart fixed that). Had another case were I couldn't see any of the update texts to know why a colnist died etc.The game is playable for the first 10 minutes, then it crashes and burns in a cesspool of bad game logic.I've given this game, and the developer, a chance for years now. I'm done. He has never fixed the core game logic, and, at this point, I doubt he ever will.  In fact, as of .57, he's added more logic that causes colonists to die even faster.----.54 update: The game now has issues with modern video cards using OpenGL 4.5 --it won't launch, and, instead, will try and ""fall back"" to OpenGL3, and then finally fail.  Stay away from this game. Looks like the dev may have tried to make his own game engine--Unity would have worked fine here. No wonder why game developent is taking so blasted long.---Instead of fixing bugs and major playability issues (which are boring to do),  the developer has focused on adding features (which are fun to do, but pointless if the game core is broken). The only thing this ""game"" will provide you with is frustration. It isn't even a beta quality project yet/Watch your colonits wander around inside your base and suffocate because they never bothered to take their space suits off. Have your colonists starve to death because they're too busy walking in circiles or standing still to eat. Watch your base equipment catch fire and burn because colonits are too busy fixing a door they just fixed a minute ago than to maintain equipment--and watch equpment filair up far more often than is fun. And come on? A work lamp becoming atorch and burning an entire room of hydroponics? That's just stupid-- no light would explode and start a fire because nobody had touched it for hours.The UI also leaves much to be desired. The UI is both keyboard and mouse based, and the keyboard element isn't well explained,. There also is no scrolling through messages, so if the text doesn't fit all on the screen (such the case with stored research), then you won't be able to read it at all.			"

Early Access Review
								I would not recommend Maia, YET!Its a very good insight into what will possibly happen but as it stands right now it is nothing more than a tech demo. There is no save game feature and you cannot progress any further than what you start off with. Basically its a colony game without colonists or any form of expansion.What is currently in the game is a handful of objects for a handful of rooms. A couple of those objects have an unknown function and nothing is really explained about the objects or indeed the colonists that you have. There is no way to get any more colonists as of yet and pretty much as soon as you build all the rooms and fill them with items you have acheived all that you can.The graphics are pretty good and although it has some clunky animations and is still rather buggy it will no doubt be polished quite nicely. It DOES have the potential to go far but even compared to other early access titles it just doesn't have enough content to even class as a game yet. Its simply a tech demo.Keep it on a watch/wish list and get it when its at a game like state.EDIT: As per the developers response you CAN save the game using keys F5 and subsequently using F9 will load your last save. Again this is obviously an unfinished feature but its a lot better than starting from fresh all the time!P.S. This review isn't intended to be negative towards the project, I love whats been done so far and im routing for Simon to get an good job done.			"

								Brilliant concept and engaging mechanics.Absolutely horrific UI.""Make sure that the system communicates what’s happening.  Always inform your users of location, actions, changes in state, or errors. The use of various UI elements to communicate status and, if necessary, next steps can reduce frustration for your user. "" There isn't even any indication you saved. For that matter there is no keybinding available.""Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity. Carefully consider how you use typeface. Different sizes, fonts, and arrangement of the text to help increase scanability, legibility and readability.""Needing to hover over somethign for 30 seconds to read the tooltip is not okay.Let's use the basics:""1. Does this interface tell me what I need to know right now?2. Is it easy to find the information I'm looking for, or do I have to look around for it? (Are the menus nested so deep that they hide information from the player?)3. Can I use this interface without having to read instructions elsewhere?4. Are the things I can do on this screen obvious?5. Do I ever need to wait for the interface to load or play an animation?6. Are there any tedious or repetitive tasks that I can shorten (with a shortcut key, for example) or remove entirely?"" Maia fails to pass any of these test except for number 6, and even that is only half passed as you need to search the internet just to find the keybindings.Great game, with an unplayable UI/UX.But, hey, it is early access.

Early Access Review
								Let's journey back to the year 2012. Barack Obama was president,  console gamer were buzzing about the upcoming Playstation 4, and a young Brit started a Kickstarter project inspired by Dungeon Keeper called Maia. It was a promising pitch - a game about controlling a colony with a 1970s British ""real"" sci-fi aesthetic. It seemed mighty ambitious for a solo developer, but I was younger, more idealistic and believed in Maia enough to pledge USD $11 on Kickstarter.Fast-forward to 2017. Barack Obama is no longer president. Playstation 4 dominates the console market, Rimworld has show gamers how a procedurally generated storytelling, colony building game can work, and Maia is still a glorifed tech demo with no signs of becoming a real game most people would want to play.  The graphics are even more outdated than they were in 2012. The game is stil buggy and lack focus. More than any of that, there's just not much to it. At the rate the developer is moving, my as of yet unborn children will be starting university before this ""game"" become anything remotely fun.I have to hand it to Simon Roth. Most indie developers would have realized by now that their plans were not going to come to fruition, given up and faded quietly into the night with whatever Kickstarter funds were left, but Simon continues to s-l-o-w-l-y build his quixotic masterpiece (?) I personally gave up any hope on this game at least 2 years ago, but for anyone thinking about buying, only do so if you're cool with buying games that are unlikely to ever be finished and even less likely to ever be good.

								This game has a lot of promise, and the dev is actively involved in it still.  However, it has been a long time since I first tried this, and many features are nothing more than game breaking concepts at this time.  There are so many things wrong with the state of the game that have remained that way through so many updates I have waning hope of ever seeing this finished.  Right now it's pretty much unplayable.  Go ahead and pick it up if you want to be a tester, and report things that have already been reported for months or years.  Don't get this until 1.0 if you just want to jump in a play.  I still have faith we'll get to that point some day... some day...			"

								Unless you really like frustration and lack of information as to why things aren't working, I'd steer clear of this for now.Maia's concept basically takes Dwarf Fortress and puts it into space, on another planet.  That's both a good and a bad thing.Like DF, you decide what needs to get done, and the colonists go off and do that on their own, with no direct control.  Unlike DF, if a colonist is unable to do something, you don't actually get any sort of message as to why — it just doesn't get done.Like DF, it's being built by a solo developer, who is focusing way more on adding new features than on fixing bugs, even old or important ones.  Unlike DF, those bugs aren't things like ""military training isn't working"" — they're game-breaking things like ""none of my colonists will go outside to make a wind turbine to generate power for the atmosphere generators, so they all die due to lack of oxygen"".Even once you get through the first few steps and get a real colony going, it's only a matter of time before colonists just up and decide they can't do some critical thing and they'd all prefer to die, and you don't get any indication why.My suggestion to the developer would be: Even if it's not part of your vision on how the final game will look — for now, give us some debugging tools!  Even if they're off by default, we need some way to show us what our colonists are up to, what tasks need doing, why they aren't being done, how priorities work, etc.  For one, it's just too frustrating to play without those right now; and two, they would enable us to give you actually helpful bug reports, instead of just vague statements like ""nobody would go outside so they all died"".Sadly, my experience playing Maia for several hours today was basically the same as my experience back in 2014.  A ton of stuff has been added, but the game feels exactly as inscrutable and unplayable now as it did back then.  I love the concept, I hope it becomes a great game someday, and I appreciate the difficulties a solo developer faces on a project of this size, but I can't base a review on hope and speculation.			"

								New Review  0.57!Main Problems:* Lots and lots of unecessary micro.  Ex:  You can build space heaters... but you have to manually turn them on and off as rooms go from too cold to too hot, apparently they can build robots, but not a rheostat. :-P   Ex:  Accoding to his youtube, if you don't manually operate the furnace, to smelt the ore... It has a chance of breaking down!  Cookie clicker isn't the best source of inspiration. :-P* Lack of useful information.   - People dying.  They need to call for help or something.  So that the user can get an indication that something is wrong.  Example:  I had a colonist die from dehydration.  I had barrels of water and a water still.  Never got a warning saying colonist thirsty and I have no clue why they died.  (Stuck someplace maybe?  Bug?  I have no clue.  Which is the problem.) - Why is something not being built.  Am I out of resources?  Is everyone too tired?  Can noone get to it?   - Are people idle?  Or is there something else preventing them from work?  Can't tell. - What workshop buildings do I need?  Are some of these just upgrades?  Or do I require some for building specific objects... No clue at all in the game. Pros:Looks nice.Overview:I tired it out again and quit as I found the lack of useful information and all the micro really annoying.  It also felt agonizingly slow... but I suspect that was because of soemthing the peons where lacking, just no clue in game as to what that is.  (Sleep, workbenches, resources, something else?)Still don't recommend buying the game.Updated review Slightly based on Developer Feedback and his latest youtube video... too busy to try out the new version because of work.Old review I had was for 0.51			"

Early Access Review
								It's not done. It's a half baked game that had a long road behind it and still has a long one ahead of it. The AI needs work, the balance needs work, the ""endgame"" doesn't really exist yet and in general you have a very obviously unfinished game in front of you. And still it's something I would recommend.The first question with every Early Access game is of course ""Will it ever be finished?"" And in this case I have a pretty good feeling, the patches come fairly frequently and they do improve the game. It's a slow progress (afaik it's a one-man show), but there is steady progress, with updates happening roughly monthly. New things get added and bugs get patched.The game itself is in a good enough state to be playable, provided you're willing to go through a try and error phase. There are some quirks that you'll have to find out so you can avoid them next time. Like how to arrange beds so colonists don't get up from one and lie down in the next one constantly 'til they starve to death. Or where to build (and where not to build) various pieces of furniture.You will restart the game often. Then again, there isn't much of an endgame in it yet anyway. If this is something you like, you're in for a great game. If you're more the kind of person who doesn't like starting over and wants to ""progress"" into something, you might want to wait until there's something you can progress to. Right now there isn't really much linear gameplay available, once survival is established, there's little left to be done but to start over and try again with a new team and maybe a new map.			"

Early Access Review
								Since my previous update, I have checked back on the game periodically. The stability of the game has greatly improved, but still not perfect, although this is to be expected with a game still in Alpha (0.57 currently). Just a few short notes below.The game has not advanced much since 2013, and is still very barebones, the AI of the “colonists” and robots still requires a lot of work, with perhaps a system of prioritisation within the AI or user set. Examples are things like, building an item and getting “trapped” by the item, or temperature problems, but they will not build a heater when requested, the robot trying to complete non-existent build orders and refusing to do anything else, although these things are not my main worry about this game.My main concern is that in the past two and a half years there has been very little progress and brings me to wonder if it will ever achieve release worthy standard.--5th of December 2013----------Keep clear for now, this is not worth being on Early Access. The constant crashing and memory errors that are being experienced by owners should be a clear warning to others.----------------------------------------------18th October 2016----------------------Avoid this buggy, poor product, awkward interfacee, horrible control scheme, with a just painful method of placing items in the world.Over 3 years and still an unplayable heap.--------------------------------------------			"

Early Access Review
								This could become an awesome game! Once it's finished and here's t he catch, the development is taking way too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long (a common issue with kickstarted games apparently). It is understandable that one guy alone cannot move mountains, and what Simon has attempted here is simply awesome, on the other hand as a kickstart contributor i've been waiting for 3 years to play. This review is for alpha 0.55 and it is the first one that i managed to keep running for more than 4 h straight. The bugs are plentyfull and diverse, from annoying to game-breaking. I am now writing this review after an extended playthrough that i would rate as very enjoyable despite the need for frequent ""save-loads"" to reinitialize the scripts. It has sadly ended in a save game that loads to crash and i will probably be waiting for at least 0.6x before attempting another run. The game at the core is truly amazing, a hard sci-fi world with tons of attention to detail and very immersive. You need to pay attention to a million small things to keep your base running and the AI is quite helpful (when not crippled by bugs). The world is a funny and strange mix of Dungeon Keeper meets Alien and it works! The only big fault I see is the planning... if you budget your game for one man for 2 years but have no chance of finishing it in that time-frame you'll run in a catch 22 , the game is in a too poor state to attract new buyers and thus you cannot hire people to accelerate the process. Nobody is willing to wait 6 years for a game to go gold regardless of how good it may become.			"

								Even though this game is still in early development, you can clearly see where the creator plans to take this game, and it's promising to be quite far! I'm loving the dark atmosphere, the odd behaviour of chickens, taking care of your colonists by trying to understand what they need and not just reading stats. It truly is a game worth trying in alpha stage!			"

Early Access Review
								Ok, so I'm going to do a review of this game in its current state of 0.54.Overall, this game isn't bad.The graphics are ok, especially since it isn't a AAA engine. (The rain kinda is wanked, but that is with most games that are top down) The concept is, in my opinion, one of the best parts of the game and I'd love to see it reach its goal. Making it into the game a few hours, I finally built a lab and was able to start doing research, though it doesn't lead to anything yet. But based on the reserach that I completed and finished, it seems that the goal it to eventually get a tech tree of some sort into the game which would increase the time to ""finish"" the game and also increase replayability.So, since this is a great concept and it seems to be on its way, what is the problem? I personaly feel like I don't know if it will ever get to its goal and dream. I've seen so many early access games come and go and never get fully finished. Like I said, the concept is great, but with a UI that needs work, menus that are slightly confusing and an AI that really doesn't seem to know what it is doing, I just don't know. Hopefully I'll get proved wrong.So, breaking down the issues with the game I'll start with the UI. The UI doesn't provide enough information at a glance. It is slightly cumbersome and it provides so few functions in general. As for the menus I'll just give a few examples; the load and save buttons aren't in the ""esc"" menu but are buttons in the upper right of your screen... ok, not bad sounding... but they aren't labeled so I lost a two hour base because I hit the ""load"" and not ""save"" icon. Another example of the UI needing work is the building menu. To switch between items as of now, one has to press ""Q"" and ""E"" a design choice I personally don't get. And that latter brings me into my last point or the AI being wonky. I can get around most of the other issues, but the AI is my biggest gripe right now. I can't tell my colonists what to do by say clicking on them and then clicking on a task I want the to complete. In some cases, this can lead to many deaths. I can set up many tasks, with the first thing I tried to build being a heater, and they'll do other things first, and die from hypothermia. lol. I mean, if I'm freezing to death, I'll build a heater first. But, IDK, maybe they know more than me.So, in the end I'm going to recommend this game with a caution. Beware of what you are getting. It is, as I said, a great concept and I think that all the negative reviews don't do it quite justice and I want to see this succeed as I miss games like this. However, I think that my fear of it not being finished or what it could be may still be well founded.			"

Early Access Review
Maia - Early AccessA Dungeon Keeper-esque space-colony builder with minimalist UItldr - I like it. Maia shows great promise, and has a very low chance of succumbing to Early Access Syndrome.GameplayYour base is built into a mountain (the atmosphere of the titular Maia is toxic). If your colonists need to go outside (to build solar stills for water, wind turbines/solar arrays for power, collecting researchable things like non-sentient alien creatures and plants, or meteorites, etc) they will use the airlock. The suits they use outside are cumbersome and slow.Inside the mountain-base you designate (much like Dungeon Keeper) areas to be mined out. Once empty areas can have rooms (such as a workshop, a research room, a living area, a hydroponics room, etc) built into them. You must then place a door, and other context specific items (for example workbenches and 3D-printers in the workshop, or beds/couches and toilets in the living area). Once a game starts you must quickly build a workshop, and add a workbench. Once that is done you must build a power system (wind turbine/solar array, or a geo-thermal power plant as well as a ""fly-wheel"" energy storage (battery). Once a power system has been built you must place atmosphere generators. That all takes care of your urgent needs. You must however secure a food source (hydroponics, or animal farms) and continually satisfy the needs of your colonists.You do not directly control your colonists.A note on the minimal UIThe devs of this game have stated from the outset that they don't want to 'spoon-feed' players to much information, and have designed the game in such a way that players must work for information. There is no ""emotion bubble"" that floats above your colonists, only biometric data like respiration rate, perspiration rate, heart-beats per minute, etc. This is just one example of a system that promotes player interaction and investigation as opposed to unrewarding spoon-feeding. All the information you'll need is there, you just have to find it.ProsA cool, and compelling theme.Easy to understand game mechanics.A tutorial (I'm serious, how many games have a proper tutorial while in Early Access!).ConsNo traditional savegames, instead you play one game at a time that can be continued if you exit the game and come back.No bordered window mode.Lacks detailed options (but there are resolution, anti-aliasing and quality options). No goals/missions other than survival (Although the latest update has added three scripted missions).Still in Early Access.The normal price of $24.99 is arguably too high for the current build (but will be a good price once Maia is feature complete).The Early Access ProblemMaia is still in Early Access (As I write this, Alpha version 0.51) which poses several problems with a recommendation. When it comes to Early Access many promising games are either; abandoned by their developers halfway through development, developed in such a way that early-adopters are angered, or have their developers react angrily from criticism. I believe that Maia, although not immune from such problems, is certainly free of them for the foreseeable future.Dev AbandonmentMaia has received regular updates, both small 'hotfixes' and major updates. The two latest major updates, Alpha 0.50 and Alpha 0.51 were deployed on the 3rd September 2015, and 22 October 2015 respectively. Each update adds a lot of new content, and fixes bugs.The developer, Simon Roth, is also very active on Twitter and happily answers questions.Bad DevelopmentSome Early Access games have started out promising but developed along different lines than what was promised. I don't think Maia is at risk of that as it's clear from development and the content of updates that Simon and his team have a clear plan and is sticking to it. Hopefully this will protect against feature-creep, and I have seen no evidence that it isn't.Naughty DevelopersSome strong games have been let down by their developers being taking criticism very badly and being rude - which does sometimes make people shy away from their games and makes adapters regret supporting such devs and their games. Simon and his team do not appear to be the type to do any of this though, as Simon is quite open on Twitter and I have never seen or heard any complaints regarding his behaviour.I wrote this review after playing 6.2 hours of Maia.

								Bugged, uninteresting. I tried to like it, I really did - I love these kind of games, and it's pretty hard to go wrong by me when it comes to sci-fi micromanagement. I've been playing since pretty early, trying to get the game to do what I want. But, it won't. I find myself constantly having to save and reload the game in order to ""kickstart"" the AI to doing what they should be doing, which hasn't been fixed since I bought it some time ago. Graphically speaking, ignore the screenshots - it's a lot of lense flare and lighting and effects trying to cover poor textures and untenable design. Updates are SLOW. This latest update seems to have been a weekend of drawing a couple of textures and dropping the script into the game. This is what counts as an update. Beyond all that, you spend about a half hour of playtime and pretty much experience everything the game will ever have to offer. Seriously. Colonists eating. Colonists sleeping. Colonists running here and there doing tasks that feel as mundane as this game is.I'll try again when it gets to Beta, but...			"

								I really want this game to work.Its right up my alley. Love the concept, can live with the graphics etc. Problem is, its really unfriendly. The AI is atrocious. The robot particularly has less CPU power than my 1985 casio calculator.The game is twitchy....some times I play, I get much further....other times....turn it off in 5 minutes. The difference  ? Nothing to do with the difficulty or my play style --> the game just decides to be either dumb or dumber.Dont regret getting this, but wish the developer would stop adding more content and just get whats already in it sorted.As many on here, I come back to it every now and again.....just to see if it is in a playable state....At present....in my opinion...it isnt.

								I have to say, this is a game I want to like. Its a great concept, but the execution is very poor.I've been patronizing this game's early access since it was available for early access, and while some bugs have been fixed, numerous game-breaking bugs still remain. Its pretty-much unplayable still, despite several months development since its initial release.Glitches in character AI get them stuck in routines that eventually lead to their deaths. For example, eating and sleeping, repeat et infinitum, while not working on the hyroponics bay. The AI seems to get deadlocked quite a lot. Since the characters start running to the food and then eating, I assume that the value for hunger isn't being reset properly.There are also animation problems that seem to somehow reflect character position. Character position in the world should not be a function of the 3D engine. The location of objects should be purely data, which is then rendered. The reason why I suspect this isn't the case in Maia is because characters ""jump"" back, particularly after a collision with a wall. Yes - they walk into walls and then teleport back a few steps. So the pathfinding is bad too. I think this is because the objects in the world are not on a real ""grid"" system. While rooms might be, everything else seems to be kinda ""free-floating"" and placable anywhere in the room / outside. While this would be cool, it doesn't work right, so its not cool.Also the object rotation system is very annoying. It would be much better if there were a ""spin by increment"" key prior to object placement. And objects can intersect eachother, which makes no sense.Additionally 6 mo after launch there's still no save / load system. The game still starts with invalid start conditions (breaches in the base start point to the outside world makes colonists unable to move around in the cavern without space suits, and the airlock is on the other side of the base). There is no way to make a new game without exiting to desktop and starting the game over. The settings are very minimal, and there are enormous problems with resolution. You click and it changes, in a cycle, rather than selecting from a menu. This is terrible because it saves the last setting, and there's no ""does this resolution work for you?"" dialog. This means you can get yourself into unusable settings and be unable to get out.Also the game performance is really quite bad.Meanwhile the creators are adding content while there are still problems with the fundamental mechanics of the game. I wonder if they understand how unusable the game is right now....			"

Early Access Review
								I fully support indie development. I buy just about anything indie that pops up on Steam (that isn't 2D). So I saw this, the premise sounded interesting, so I grabbed it. I immediately got into the game and was presented with a VERY early release game that really shouldn't be on Steam at all.The game menu starts with ""Launch"", ""Settings"" and ""Abort"". Settings consists of... ""Toggle Fullscreen""... that's it. Nothing else. No keybinds, no graphics, no sounds, NOTHING. The other two menu options are self explanatory.In-game you're presented with a couple tutorial tasks, but it throws you into the world with no real understanding of how to build, what each item does, and what's really needed.I found myself being frustrated with some of the game functions like building a couch for example. If I hover a section of the room, it gives me the build for the couch. If I move around and accidently touch a wall or door, the build option turns into a door and I have to cycle back through the build items again (using V and B keys). Annoying.I branched my outpost out with additional rooms and my characters refused to venture into it. I was left with having to cheat build to get the rooms to finish. Then, after I did that (having waited minutes for the NPC's to do it), my characters ventured that way by walking through walls. I felt pretty disappointed with this title. That's not to say that with patches and updates it wont be decent. It's one of those early releases that I'm left scratching my head wondering why this was accepted by Steam, let alone at a price tag of $25. I just missed by 5 hours, a 25% off sale which is also quite disappointing.All in all... wait this one out. Give it time to really get fleshed out, and turn into a solid title before you give it a try. You might regret it now. I know I did.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is promising.  It looks lovely, its systems look to be interesting, and its sense of humor is enjoyable.  But at this point it's simply too unpolished to really be worth buying.---The most obvious problem is that there are no (reasonably functional) speed controls.  The game, as far as its UI will inform me, has exactly one speed, sloth.  People move like molasses and completing basic tasks takes ages.  And despite this pokey pace, you can't sit back and relax as you strategize as you would with other games in the genre because there's no real-time pause fuction - sure, there's an undocumented pause function if you hit the Pause Break key, but this can often crash the game.  The result is that you need to quickly queue up your commands, almost a bit like Starcraft but without the immediately obedient underlings or any of the good UI design that went into that game.This is made worse by the awful controls - the game's framerate is still not as good as it should be so it's already not quite responsive enough on reasonable hardware, but inconsistent controls make planning out your base maddening.  When placing items, right click both returns you back to your regular cursor/interact mode and removes items under your cursor, either queuing placed items for destruction or immediately removing what you just placed.  The result is a lot of frustration as you have to swipe away to an empty part of the map to safely right-click your way out, or risk misclicking with the flakey FPS when trying to click the menu item to swap out of item placement.Placing rooms of course breaks this convention - right click will remove placed floors, but it does so immediately without any queuing so you can very easily cause messy problems that you'll then need your minions to slowly fix, and if you right click in an empty area you don't go back to Interact mode like you'd expect.And Interact mode, where you can click on stuff and see information or view the station from the point of view of your colonists in first person (which is neat and even has a low-res camera feed filter), also doubles as your mining tool, so you'll frequently be mining things when you're just trying to click on a moving colonist.Oh, and you have to do all this when it shakes the screen due to eathquakes, meteorites, and cave-ins, which are annoyingly frequent and make it hard to just control the game.Then there's just the bizzare key placement.  Y and N are something you need to frequently hit, and I mean frequently, which is rather uncomfortatble since the game expects you to have a constant WASD grip.  The three main building tools - the aforementioned Interaction, Room, and Item modes - are bound to J, K, and L respectively.  These keys are nowhere near WASD where your fingers will be resting most of the time, while Z, X, and C right underneath remain unbound.  Why?  The keys are at least rebindable, though you'll have to spend a good amount of time figuring out what keys are important and which are pointless from experience.  The tutorial doesn't even bother telling you want the keys are, and the UI doesn't bother listing the keybind either on its icons.These may seem like small nitpicks, but bad controls combined with time pressure in what's usually a more methodical genre make for an incredibly frustrating experience.---And then we get into the typical EA problems.The game provides very little feedback on why your colonists aren't doing what they need to do.  I can have three full barrels of water and water fountains everywhere, yet my colonists will mysteriously die of dehydration regardless.  Hopefully this eventually changes, but for now it's complete guesswork as to what's wrong.  In a good Dwarf Fortress-like game you don't always know immediately what little cog in your operation is causing a holdup, but at the very least you have tools at your disposal to figure out what's going on.  Those tools apparently don't exist yet, mousing over a colonist gives some physical information but you can't get useful stuff like the last letter they wrote or recent complaints or anything like that, instead forcing you to dig through the often busy feed (while the game is still running in real time, mind you).  And since the game is buggy, you can't ever feel confident that you're losing because you messed up, you're always wondering if the AI is just being bad and not doing obvious things like eating when it's hungry.Then there's the lack of content, bugs, and general unfinished state of the game that you'd expect out of an EA title.  Yeah, it's nothing shocking, but it's nothing special either that really demands your money now like Kerbal Space Program or Darkest Dungeons or Space Engineers.  Updates happen, but they sure as hell take their time.  This game's been in EA for a long time and it still feels like it has a long way to go.~~~The game simply isn't ready for your money.  I want to love the game so much and it feels like in two years maybe there will be a game worth playing, but as it is now it's just a really pretty piece of junk compared to other Dorflikes like Dwarf Fortress, Prison Architect, or even other EA games like Stonehearth.  It's not Spacebase-DF9 levels of terrible, there aren't unexplainable oxygen leaks that eventually kill everyone with no further promises to improve, but it just gets so many little things wrong that it can't hold a candle to a game like Banished.Wait and see, the game has the potential to be great.

Early Access Review
I work on Maia - So you should treat anything I say as biased, untrustworthy, probably composed of festering garbage.Short summary: Maia is a unique, captivating game. It explores the possibility of a human colony on an alien world. Even in its present unfinished state, Maia is worthy of purchase and full of potential for enjoyment and delight.OverviewI first encountered Maia at a game show in 2014. Being fascinated by space exploration, I was immediately sucked in. Maia 'gets' space exploration in the same way DayZ 'gets' zombies: The story is not the zombies, it is the people.In Maia, people are at the heart of the experience. They do what the want. They interact with each other. They may follow your orders, or they may laze about and die of starvation. They might threaten each other, become sad, grow happy, or develop relationships. They are truly a group of colonists, going about life on an alien world.GameplayInteraction with Maia is indirect. The player never builds structures, or conducts research. Instead, requests are placed in the world and colonists then react to those requests. I use the word 'request' rather than order, because colonists will not always carry out instructions.At first, their ambivalence to a placed Atmosphere Generator may be interpreted as a bug in the game. With more play time it becomes apparent that the colonists have a sense of what is important, and what is required. Already have too many Solar Arrays? Colonists might simply choose not to build them.There are no centralised mechanisms for managing colony power, food, and water requirements. Instead, individual stores must be inspected, and observations taken around the world. This quirk can sometimes be frustrating, but that frustration can give way to fulfillment - Balancing a power grid is very hard, and more rewarding for being so.Often I see Maia referred to as a 'God Game.' Having never played 'God Games,' and not being familiar with the genre, I can't speak to the accuracy of that description. I would not, however, describe Maia as a god game in the first instance: The player is not god, they are a companion. Not omniscient, omnipresent, or all-powerful at all. Instead, the player is limited, flawed, and often ineffectual - A reflection, perhaps, of the colonists pottering about on the planet surface, and all the more enjoyable for it.AesheticsGenerally, I am about as artistic as a pencil sharpener, so I'm not the one to judge Maia's aesthetics. But I think it looks fantastic.The use of a custom renderer means the game does not express the intangible 'feel' of a commercial solution such as Unity or Unreal. Instead, it gives of a vibe of bespoke craftsmanship. Models are of a consistently high quality. Animations are well weighted and engaging - Though they are often blatantly disconnected from the gameplay their are supposed to be related to.TechnicalEarly Access games come in various flavours of 'bugginess,' and Maia has tended to hover towards the 'very buggy' end of the spectrum through much of its development. Because Maia does not offer many explicit clues to the player about what is happening in the world, bugs can be insidious. A colonist sitting on the floor of a room may be bored and recalcitrant: Or their AI might simply be stuck in a buggy loop of doom.Recently, the Stardystopia Update has brought fresh stability and consistency to the experience. If Stardystopia is a foundation upon which Maia grows in future updates, then it has the potential to leave its challenged technical past behind.DevelopmentJudging the character of Maia's development is perhaps the act in which my conflict of interest is most likely to manifest itself. It is also the area of which I am most critical.An Early Access game must be open. To be on Steam Early Access to not just invite, it is to require the interaction of customers with the development team. It has been difficult for Maia's customers to find information about development. In the last few months, the team has made strides towards pulling down the fourth wall and letting information flow out to customers. This process must accelerate.The pacing and content of development updates are strong. Most especially since around March this year Maia has received consistent, high quality updates that have steadily improved the game.Most importantly, Maia's development team has authentic soul and character. Simon, Caroline, Leanne, Ruairi, Hannah and others are committed, tireless, optimistic, and hard working. They want Maia to be a better product, and are constantly putting in the effort to make it so.ConclusionMaia is a unique, captivating game. It explores the possibility of a human colony on an alien world. Even in its present unfinished state, Maia is worthy of purchase and full of potential for enjoyment and delight.			"

Early Access Review
								I backed Maia on Kickstarter and I feel that now is a good time for people to buy it on Greenlight. Personally, I think that Maia went to Greenlight too early, while there were still too many bugs and issues. But with 0.46 the game is stable and playable for many people and the future promise is just starting to show through. For new players there's probably a solid afternoon of playtime here, plus some replay value. There's no combat yet, but it's planned for the next build (0.47) and I imagine that this will boost re-playability a great deal.I was initially drawn to Maia by the atmospheric trailers and the potential shown in the very first alpha builds. The aesthetic and design of Maia is fantastic. The art and music combine to create a slightly unsettling, suspenseful atmosphere that's lifted by the numerous little touches of wry humour and observation; many of which are genuinely clever. Hitchhiker's meets Alien.If Simon and team manage to wrap their unique design around a enjoyable and challenging colony builder then this will definitely be a stand-out title for the future.As a guide to what's coming next, here's a link to the 'rough' feature roadmap  - Rough roadmapIf you still aren't sure then hold back for a month or two until the game is more fleshed out, but definitely keep an eye on Maia.

								I don't get it. What's so difficult? I build a workshop. I build a workbench. I place the obejects for a heater and atmospheric device in there. Colonist rn between storage and workshop, eventually die of asphyxiation and/or hypothermia because none of them will build the objects that will keep them alive.The really infuriating thing? Sometimes they will build them. But they refuse to build a smelter so then when I run out of building materials, I can't get anymore to build the heater in the hydroponics bay so they stop freezing to death just standing around in it......This...Problem of the AI simply refusing to do the simple tasks put to them has been an issue since day one, guys. Fix your damn AI's prority systems.[EDIT 10th September 2016]AI Still needs some kind of prioritisation setting or system. If I tell them to build an O2 generator, and an airvent, I expect them to do it, not spend 2-5 days wandering around thinking about it.			"

								After a few hours playing I am impressed with the complexity and thoughtfulness of the game. Base building in Maia is fun and allows for a range of customisation. The research choices, power management, social and hunger/thirst needs provide a well balanced experience. At time of writing there are some bugs, the game is in active development so of course it's to be expected. You'll still get plenty of enjoyment from Maia though, and I'd strongly recommend it for anyone who likes base building or strategy games.			"

								I loved the concept of this game from the beginning, but really can't recommend it. The development has been snail pace, I understand it's a single dev but he doesn't seem to have any idea on stopping and editing. It performs no better than day 1 and keeps having new things added in that make it perform worse. The GUI is horrible and unintuitive and the bugs just keep piling up without any look to fix them unless by accident it seems. I've given up ever seeing the game that was pitched originally.			"

								Do not waste your time and money on this game. In its current state its barely playable and will just frustrate you to tears. Each update brings more features and content but even more bugs. If its current rate of development continues it will take years to even leave alpha. While it shows some promise and I really want it to work, I seriously doubt it will ever realise its full potential before the plug is pulled on this project.Update: I tried to play the recent build of 0.56 and I hate to say that this game has gotten even worse somehow. Your colonists are even more stupid than ever before, despite several A.I improvements mentioned in patch notes. Instead of roaming around weeping themselves into starvation they will now wander aimlessly freezing to death, as weeping and sitting on the floor is more productive to their survival than building a wall heater apparently. There are many many more ridiculous bugs that are each just as game breaking that seem to never be fixed, but rather compounded with each content patch. If the current build was made to be somewhat playable before new mechanics and other content is added or if what is stated in the patch notes is actually present in the game I may have hope for this game. But as it stands, there is none.TL;DRThe game is still broken, has been in alpha for years and will never be worth your money			"

								First, let me say, it does have great progress so far, and comming along.  I think more people should support it, that said ...So I went on a mission, where the mission items were timed (I really hate to be pushed on timers, not fun at all). But ok, not a huge deal.  Built what I needed to, down to 5 mins, put some items down, including the main mission item – a communications antenna.  Some people were doing nothing, and eventually started building.  Seems they didn’t get the memo that communications was the next mission item, so they left it last.  1.5 minutes left, communications still pending, people are walking around, and hugging, etc., and the timer is ticking away.  It eventually reaches 0, mission failed, and the colonists don’t give a damn, lol. Ok, I think I put down too many items at once, so I did it a bit more controlled. There’s very little room for error, as you have to think minutes ahead (not seconds). Made it to the next mission item – also timed (argh). Ok, so started to clear an area.  Colonists are now complaining about needing sleep, and food, but the medical center and beds is the top priority?  I guess it is in case they die from hunger while working as slaves to build while starving to death because the timer doesn't have any wiggle room. I also needed more power, built another wind generator, then started the medical building, laid out the door, and 3 medical beds.  After 1-2 minutes, a colonist finally shows up to build it, and the door, and leaves the beds and takes off.  Ok, no problem, 1.5 minutes left, let’s see if anyone comes to finish the beds.  Timer runs out, mission failed, colonists don’t give a damn (again – 3 beds was the mission item), lol.Cool, you can control the robots in first person view. After clicking the mouse button, I thought the robot pooped/regurgitated something awful. Oh ok, just the rocks I guess it collected? Not a bad thing, just funny. ;)You can right-click to de-select the active action under your cursor when building items. You can also right-click to destroy a building without warning (oops). Costs time and materials to rebuild what was destroyed in a fraction of a second.  Had to reload the game (on timers after all, no room for error).In the middle of all this, while building, the game takes control and throws the camera over to the incoming colonists.  I DON’T CARE, I saw the message already, let me finish what I was doing.  Now I don’t even know where I was, must scroll back – yet, on the way, the camera pulls me to something else. :/Keep getting a warning the storage room is getting cold.  You can now hover over rooms to see their temperatures. I built atmospheric generators to help (one per room), and it helps, but I found out from watching a video that you only need space heaters in other places.  How much do they output though, or how much power is required? Doesn’t say.  I can see the temperatures in rooms rising now.  Stats are getting better, but still a bit poor list of stats, still difficult to see what’s really going on around the base.It also crashed a few times in a way that made the cursor disappear.  Make sure to save often.Things it needs:1. Much better AI (perhaps even mission focused). Enough hanky panky, get back to work!2. A priority system, so you can better queue up what needs to get built first.3. Much better stat reporting on the items (especially generator outputs for one). If there is a warning a room is cold, at least show room stats also.4. Status icons you can click to quickly bring you to the events/issues. DONT FORCE MY CAMERA - I might be in the middle of something. 5. Automated smelter, or show an icon when it is waiting, or done. Don't turn this into a space focused Farmville game, lol.

6. Fix building bugs (see comments), random crashes (rare), and errors restarting missions (always have to restart the game).7. Built hydroponics for food, but people are still dying from starvation? lol This needs to be fixed. If I'm missing something, then that should be in my notifications. ;)8. No idea what anything does, or why I need it, nor how many I need to make.  There are details when selecting items to build, but no text describing what it is for.  Makes it a bit tedious to keep looking up what things are for, and why. For example, until I watched a video, I had no idea space heaters could be used instead of atmospheric generators.  I thought I needed a generator in every room.I'll keep an eye on these issues and update the review as the game progresses.  I think it is a great game to support, but I had to give a thumbs down until a lot of issues are ironed out. I'm half afraid sometimes to play it in fear I forget to save and it crashes. ;) Perhaps Auto-save is needed at an internval I can specify.			"

								Some issues I found in the game while playing:- Some NPCs will often start walking in circles trying to find a sweet spot to reach something and will stay like this for a while (minutes, sometimes 10 minutes or more), and if this NPC is a human being, it will starve to death.- The colonists starve to death even if there is plenty of food- The animation for the ""aliens"" to die takes really long. Like ""Wow you shot me? Just hang on while I prepare to die... just a minute... almost there. Okay, dead""- There is nothing you can do about the bodies outside the base and sometimes the alarm will just keep warning about the base perimeter, even if everything out there is dead.- When you ask the colonists to build a materials hopper they just won't... until they feel like it. But then your entire base is completely full of rocks and they WON'T TAKE THE ROCKS FROM THE FLOOR AND PUT THEM IN THE HOPPER!- The colonists walk too slow. So slow that they often starve or fadigue to death on the way to their assignment.- There are not many things to do in the game, so the player may get bored REALLY FAST. No action, no jumpscares, no nothing... and it gets boring.- After you built the entire base, it will be too big, and the colonists will die because of fatigue due to their deficient AI.- When a colonist die from the fire on the atmosphere creator (?) it will become a burning corpse and won't move.- Sometimes colonists die and just stay there, standing... creepy.- Colonists will ignore bodies and people dying. This should be prioritized. My reccomendations:(To the developer)- Fix the bugs before developing new stuff. People are getting tired of the bugs and are leaving the game.- Some more action would be a nice thing (if you really want to develop new stuff)- Make the colonists faster! They run and stop too much! It's so annoying.- In base, the colonists in the suit should walk faster.- Try to program a new AI. They should prioritize some stuff, like eating and resting! They die of thirst and hunger even when you have lots of water and food avaiable. I don't think a human being would starve to death due to his many assignments. He would eat and then work.- They get hungry too fast.(To the players)- The game has a really nice concept but is still in development. It's still unfinished! If you don't have patience to wait for the developer to fix stuff, just don't try any alphas. You will get tired and will just get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for no reason. - If you do have a lot of patience, my advice: play it. The game is really cool and it makes you imagine all the possibilities for it in the future. It's raw, but when cooked it's gonna be crazy :P			"

								It's coming along nicely with regular updates, I really enjoy watching games progress through development and they do a good job of telling you what they're working on and the lead developer does livestreams on twitch.https://twitter.com/maiaAs far as gameplay goes my biggest gripes are the AI gets a little derpy once your base gets really big and sometimes colonists get stuck on the environment and starve to death. But those problems may or may not even be there in a couple of weeks.Since my major draw is the development process and watching the game grow I'm quite happy with how the developer is doing and how the game is coming along, but if you're primarily interested in playing it may be a little frustrating with the bugs. Such is Early Access, it works for me but not for everybody.			"

								Rating based on what is present. When/if things are resolved, will be ammended.Good potential in what is there but at this point after following the game for a few years now preceding the Early Access release it is still in dire need of:* Colonist behaviour tuning so they don't just feel like partially-autonomous robots just running about performing reactive duties - Missing are Social interactions, off-duty behaviour, interests, role ownership in that it doesn't take 5 colonist engineers to attempt to change a lightbulb. If one person decides they will own the job of changing light bulbs it should be their responcibility, and just generally seeing colonists do more than just bounce between reactions.* Some means for the player to actually be involved in the colony even if it's through passive influence events. Currently you say where rooms go and what objects go where, then you're done and have nothing to do forever except sit watching a rather interesting/destructive screensaver. Complex simulation inclusion is great for a game, but a game it does not make in itself if you have no avenue for continious engagement.* Cleaning up some of the AI in place, especially in the areas of pathfinding common occurance still for example is Imps walking through solid walls and then finding themselves stuck on the other side when they notice that wall is solid making the player demolish chunks of their base or cavern walls in reaction to buggy behaviour.

								Have been following this game through development for a while now, both by playing each new increment, and also watching the dev streams.Firstly, lets reiterate that this is an Early Access Game. This means that it's in development, some features aren't 100% correct, bugs 'may' be included (for now), and it's not a final product.Maia isn't your everyday resource planning, create, build kind of affair. Yes, it has those elements, but the game is way more technical and scientific. You have to bear in mind breathable atmosphere for your people. You have to watch for the core temperature and air flow. Create correct conditions for plant and animal life to grow. And watch that your people don't go loco and start losing their minds.Graphically the engine is quite well done. Visual representation of solar flares, and external radiation are well done. Of course these conditions affect your environment too. Building and placing objects is pretty easy to do, after some practice you'll be placing and moving about freely. Personally I would like to be able to zoom out a little further, but that's personal preference.Looking forward to more interaction with the wildlife - they are out in the wild, but I've yet to experience them attacking my crew, for example.The addition of missions is a welcome one too. You have objectives to achieve and a time limit to do so. Once complete, you progress further on. I've not tried all of them but they certainly make you focus on the tasks in hand.Just remember - early on - Crew need clean air, food, water. Nail that down quick and fast.Looking forward to seeing what's coming next to this game - certainly a worthy purchase, in my opinion.			"

								I was really looking forward to playing MAIA as I have been following it for a long time now.  After reading some positive reviews I thought I would give it a shot.  Unfortunately there are still many issues with the game and I cannot recommend it to anyone, even if its on sale.  One major problem would be with the AI.  The workers and robots  are so slow to respond and complete tasks that I alsways died from freezing.  All I needed to stop freezing is to build a workshop, wind generator (outside) and some wall heaters but this is almost impossible to complete because the workers refuse to complete the tasks or are too slow to complete anything.  Another problem would be the UI, there is no icons or buttons to show you have much power/water/food you have.  Instead you get emails after each day to update you with the amounts??  I understand this game is Early Access but it has been here about three years now, so I was expecting further progress.			"

								The game that never gets finished.2 and a half years ago it was released as extremely early access pre-alpha on steam, since then it has hardly improved at all and is not even remotely close to being finshed or playable.Today the game still has many of the same bugs and issues it did when it was released and is still in a barely playable state.The developer is still working on the game, but at the pace it is going and considering how inexperienced and inefficient the developer still is after all these years, it seems the game will still take another 2-3 years to finish.Because the idea behind this game is rather interesting and refreshing, and there aren't a whole lot of alternatives, it may be worth checking in on this game again in another 2-3 years. Then again, by then there might be something much better.So for now, do not buy, not even on sale. It's not even remotely worth it at the moment.			"

								If you like god games, hard sci-fi, hyper-realistic sims, and dark, British humour, then you'll like Maia.I've played Maia for about 20 hours now, more than enough to have built myself a fully self-sustaining colony with all the bells and whistles, including the rooms that require certain levels of research, so I've seen pretty much all of the permutataions of gameplay you can get within the game.It took me a while to get that Maia is a delicate balance between active user input (build orders, smelting stuff, etc) and watching the formidable AI systems run. However, once I understood this, my colony ran a lot better, was more productive, and I got a lot more out of gameplay. Another challenge is balancing the amount of activity. Unlike other sims, your colonists get tired and sick and dehydrated if you work them too hard, so you can't just set 4892438 build orders and go make some tea. On that note, I LOVE the level of detail - from temperatures reactive to whether an air vent system is on or off, to body heat of chickens altering room temperatures, to the relative humidity being affected by water condensing systems, to atmosphere quality being augmented by potted plants, to plants *literally* getting species-specific diseases like fungal rot and black spot... there is phenomenal detail in here that I struggle to understand at the best of times, but massively appreciate.Another thing is that dev Roth is quite literally the King of the Easter Egg. Most people probably don't notice or read the descriptions and names of objects, but there are some real 'laugh out loud' examples of punning names that play very well within the cultural nexus of dry, dark British humour. There's also a brilliant sense of British understatement to the emails - instead of saying 'we're literally starving here, half-wit, build some food prep stations', they say wonderfully passive aggressive things like ""I hope this lack of X isn't another bureaucratic oversight."" Ah, the art of the strongly worded letter is strong in this game.In terms of practical playability, the game is pretty easy to get the hang of; controls are intuitive, and the 'tabbing through' range of objects based on context rather than having to go through a sims-style full-scale menu system is great.The fact that the game is still under development shouldn't put you off - it's fully fledged already, and the updates (like 0.60 adding colonist relationships... again, how the heck was this coded in?!) just add more levels of detail and interest to an already fully formed and extremely well-thought-out idea. I paid full price for the game and don't mind as it's an indie dev, but it seems like it has frequent sales, so definitely pick this up right now.Overall 9/10, definitely reccommend.			"

Early Access Review
								Maia is an intelligent, engaging, darkly humourous game. The overall feel is an enjoyable blend of contemporary sci-fi and 70s retro. It's a base management/survival sim that takes healthy splashes of inspiration from games like The Sims, Dungeon Keeper and Evil Genius. It's rich in character; touches like colonist-created, programmatically generated music and haiku, and colonist skillsets like cat appeasement and lukewarm tea brewing, add an undeniably charming flavour to the game.In action, it's a constant, remarkably challenging exercise in staving off disaster, whether caused by your colonists' stupidity, the environment's general malice, your own ineptitude at the sheer complexity of colony management - or, admittedly, the occasional bug, as the game is still very much a work in progress. That complexity is both one of the game's biggest selling points, and one of its biggest hurdles; the sheer intricacy of the simulation's modelling gives the game enormous depth - if you can navigate your way up the remarkably steep learning curve.The game discards many of the usual crutches of simulation and management games. The inability to directly control your colonists certainly adds to the challenge, making the gameplay experience more one of orchestration than direct management; likewise the lack of a comprehensive, point-by-point UI - beyond the basics, the stats and status of your base and colonists are communicated more by visual and audio cues than direct notifications. The overall sensation is one of trying to conduct an orchestra comprised largely of simpletons, playing music utterly unfamiliar to you, where a quarter of the instruments are invisible, another inaudible, and nobody thought to bring any sheet music. It's unashamedly difficult, but deeply satisfying one you manage to get a handle on things.The game is absolutely still a work in progress, but with enormous promise. The developer, Simon Roth, is active and engaged, and calling him deeply deeply invested would be an understatement. I look forward to watching it grow and flourish towards full release. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys sci-fi, has a penchant for micro-management, and is perhaps just a bit of a masochist.			"

								My only real complaint with this game is the absolutely atrocious colonist AI that will, more often than anything else, be the undoing of your colonies.From absolutely refusing to build heaters when they're dying to hypothermia, to totally forgetting how to escape the airlock, the colonists of Maia are atrociously, ridiculously, incredibly stupid.But other than that, this is a great game. Recommend- but please lord, fix the AI, Simon.			"

								 Is promising. I enjoyed what I played barring the glitches. AI is weakpoint as far as I can see. It's possible now to see the type of game and gameplay that the final product is  going to have. I recommend it if you would be happy playing it for a short while every now and then until it is more fleshed out.			"

								I really want to like Maia - and largely I do. I was part of this game's IndieGogo campaign four years ago. I'm a huge Dwarf Fortress fan, and Maia was promised to be sort of like a Dwarf Fortress in space. This seems largely accurate, since Maia has been in an alpha release format for years, is designed around a story-lite rogue-like colony building simulation, and it has some pretty heavy detail on certain things (colonist moods, for instance). However, Dwarf Fortress is playable (your mileage may vary). Maia is really not playable and hasn't been for some time. I imagine that making a game is difficult, especially with a small independent team. However, the game got a couple hundred thousand dollars from Kickstarter and tens of thousands from the IndieGogo side. I do very much hope that I'll be able to change my review of this. In its current state, I cannot recommend it to anyone -- especially for this price. I don't regret buying into the crowdfunding campaign, but I am pretty disappointed at the abandonware/vaporware aspect of it. It has a lot of potential. Perhaps some day it will be realized.			"

								This game is a mess. I kickstarted it way back in 2012 and it´s still not playable. I would like to know what have done in those 3 years?! Other games like the Shadowruns, Pillars of Eternity, Broken Sword5 I backed at around the same time and those games have long been finished and shown a high levelm of polish. I can´t even run the game without it crashing all the time and I don´t think that it will ever be fnished. And he promised a story and missions etc. As if that will ever come...I spent 15$ on this and I cry a tear for every single one. Such a waste.Save your money. This is as good a cash grab as it gets.			"

								Maia is still in early Alpha, which means it has quite a few bugs.  It will crash in the middle of play.  The AI will do stupid things.  There are graphical glitches.  Many things don't work or don't provide feedback on how to manage them properly.If you can get past all that, it's actually a really fun game to play.  I've been playing about 16 hrs and done pretty much everything there is to do.  Since I bought it on sale, I feel like it was a fairly good deal - especially since it will continue to expand and improve.It's possible to set up a functional base and complete everything that has been built so far in sandbox mode.There are also 3 missions, and 10 more to be released soon.  I can only complete 2 missions due to bugs, but that's what you get with early releases like this.The devs seem responsive and are updating the game regulary (roughly quarterly), as well as participating in the Steam forum.  If you don't mind quite a few rough edges and an AI that will occasionally starve to death with plenty of food in the next room, I definately recommend this game :)			"

								While the concept of the game is interesting, in it's Alpha state it is dreadful to play and already needs considerable reworking with some of the main functions and controls along with the expected need to expand on basic gameplay and related concepts.   This doesnt count any regular bugs encountered. I look forward to seeing a product that has had a lot more work done so I can say something positive.			"

								Even though I recommend this game its merely for the fact that it is still in Alpha and that it is harsh to give it a negative opinion for the long run. However in its current state this game is NOT playable in the least bit. However it shows great promise and its concept is very intriguing. My current suggestion is to wait till Beta testing comes so that there is a better AI, unless you enjoy watching your crew run to your food stores and do nothing but eat until they suffocate from not trying to build their oxygen processor.

								There are constant updates which is nice, but so much of the core game is broken. Colonists keep not doing tasks - instead hanging out near an object untill they starve even if food is 20m away. Objects wont be built even if they are set to high prority and resourses to do so are abundent and the workers exist (again just kinda milling about). Would avoid untill this is game untill its done, and dont get me wrong there is work being put in to making it - its just that at this point its more like a crappy demo.			"

								The game seems like it will be good, and it has a lot more content than when i first picked it up when it appeared on Steam EA. But, it is somewhat unplayable right now. It randomly crashes, and the AI is either bugging out and colonists/robots end up stuck in place, or they are actually getting stuck. Colonists seem to get materials, go to work desk, and then repeat, endlessly. The UI isn't finished yet, even the main menu is bad - instant changing resolution when you click for the next one, and you can only click one way :/ .So, I would recommend following the game, and seeing what it is like in 6 months or a year.

Early Access Review
								I'd like to preface this review by saying that the game is in Alpha and I'll update the review as things change if I have time.Ok, so I haven't written a review before but decided to write one for this game. First I'll just list Pros and Cons in order then describe a little about it from my experience thus far,Pros:-Neat idea worth expanding on-Good graphics for an alpha-Fun*-Harder sci-fi than some I've played-Devs work on the game and respond to feedback (Got an answer on the review initially)Cons:-Bugs-More bugs-Occasionally problematic UI-Optimization issues-AI build priorities-Inability to manually control colonistsSo, I'll start with the Pros. First off is the idea, I like it. It is always nice to see older style technology (Like the capsules the colonists land in) in a Sci-fi game instead of the constant use of sleek and streamlined ships and tech. Next up is the graphics, they are actually surprisingly good for an alpha game although I'll admit I've never been much of a snob about graphics. Now on to the ""Fun"" I mentioned, it is not fun in the sense of a fast-paced action kind of fun. It is more of a challenging fun associated with overcoming the challenges of survival. And finally, the last pro, ""Hard"" sci-fi. I find hard sci-fi to be more interesting a challenge in a game and that made it just a bit more interesting to me. For example: to get water you have to build a solar still and for food you need to build and maintain a hydroponics area instead of just building a food replicator or the like. Now on to the Cons. First off let's talk about the bugs, most of the other reviewers say that the dev/devs have focused on features over bugfixing (time will tell if that's true, I've only had the game a few days at time of writing.) I think the dev/devs should absolutely focus on bugfixes first, at least the game breaking ones that is. A good example of this has happened to me several times in a single game where I would call in some additional colonists and they would just stand outside the capsule waiting to die in their suits, that needs to be fixed. Apart from that, there are a few bugs I've encountered like one of my I.M.P. bots just standing in front of a fossil stand that was full holding a fossil and wouldn't dig or another one where my maintenance bots wouldn't go around the local Flora to repair my wind turbines so I had to manually drive them out and around the plants. Now that bugs have been adequately discussed let's move on to the UI. It is hardly there, kind of annoying to get used to, and is a little hard to use for rotating items without placing them. In addition to those, there is no way to save your game during it so you have to hope that it saves it. And, finally, on to the the optimization I mentioned. It freezes while loading it but eventually does get running. It is a minor issue but I did find it frustrating that the game freezes each time I start it even though it'll run well after it loads (with bugs and UI issues of course). TL;DR: It is definitely worth waiting on. I'll recommend it but with one planet sized caveat: it is buggy and very much an Alpha. In other words, watch the game and buy it when bugs get fixed.**UPDATE**I said I'd come and update the review over time, so I will. The bug with colonists getting stuck coming out of their pod is fixed. There are still some problems with AI priorities so far and the game crashes occasionally. For the AI priorities, I can set them to build the basics of a colony (Like heaters, atmosphere generators, and wind turbines) and they will not get around to much of it and die of hypothermia. One new problem I have with it has emerged though, and it is admittedly a little bit nitpick-y. The problem is that the escape menu has no save option or ""quit to main menu"" button. I'm assuming it is a save and quit situation, but it is still a little odd that I can't save with how much it crashes for me at present. I'd be fine with a ""save and continue"" or ""save and quit to menu"" option or something similar. I'd still recommend following the game, it is interesting and you don't see too many more ""hard sci-fi"" styled games like it. I'd recommend buying it if you don't mind it being a little buggy or supporting the devs though.			"

								I really, really wish I could write a positive review for this game. It is fun! I do enjoy playing it! So, why can I not recommend it? Why am I writing a negative review? Because I do enjoy playing it. That is, when I can. When I don't mind waiting 5 minutes for the game to load to the main menu. When it doesn't crash on me (something that occurs far to often). I've been following this game for several year now. I bought into the alpha back in mid 2013, or at least well before it hit steam. It was in Alpha then, and is in Alpha now. Even Minecraft didn't take this long in alpha, and its alphas were far more stable. I was playing through this game just before writing this, wanting to record some footage to post online. I played for about 17 minutes, after which it crashed. Lost that save. And if I wanted to start it up again...whelp, gotta wait for the game to load the menu, in order to load the game. Oh, and DON'T EVEN THINK about changing any graphics settings, unless you want to wait a minute and a half until the game decides it's ready. Also, while this maybe due to me having a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4:3 monitor, but I could not play this game in any widescreen resolutions, even in windowed mode. This game had, and still has, so much potential. If it wasn't so crash prone, and didn't take a lifetime to load, I wopuld recommend it. It is fun!....WHEN it works. The problem is, well, it tends not to. Not for very long, at least. It's as crashy now as it was back in 2013. 2 years, and still a crashy, buggy alpha. It feels like more effort has been put on gameplay and features, and less on fixing bugs. What good is gameplay, even amazing gameplay, if you're unable to enjoy it due to bugs and crashes? I want to play it more, I really do! It's just...why bother? I'll get really into it, and oh well then hello there crash! Oh, and goodbye save.			"

								I have been enjoying this game  for a little bit over a month. I like the idea and the visual approach. The game play took a bit of getting used to and given it's still being polished I can't really base the review too much on it. Yes there are things I'm hoping that will be fixed, like selection squares that do not dissapear upon deselection, room tiles that don't go away after cancelling the construction, people who take forever to build things while running about aimlessly back and forth. Robots who can't always reach their mining destination despite doing so earlier is another thing I've been bumping into quite often. Or people dying of starvation or malnutrition despite having full stock of rations. I should also add my humans last a veeeery long time without a bathroom.One of the major things I would find helpful is having more information on  item descriptions. While some are self explanatory, a short line saying what it does and what it requires to work would be great to have. I had to go online to see what does what so far. Another thing I'd personally appreciate is being able to prioritise construction in some way according to your selection or order in which a specific item was placed.All in all I will be keeping an eye on further updates and I think I will have more and more fun with the game in the future.

								I am really sorry to write this review, this game had much charme and potential when ive first found it, but now it is nearing years ago and it still hasnt come ANYWHERE near completion or progress.... ive come back to this several times after i got it, anytime i get the same experience... slow performance and the worst AI ive seen so far. If you following your people which you cant control - they seem to be wasting time, starving with food available or doing nothing at all, instead of the most important and only tasked jobs. Status reports complain about energy, food or needing worktables while all are either build or queued already. That does not seem to concern the people, they rather die or walk somewhere (with or without doors, who needs em appearently when they are queued for building)I'd love to revisit this once again, but it will probably be many months from now and it will take more than charme to change my mind. This game made me really sad and seeing a 20€ price tag on this early access title is not making it better. "

								Maia is sci-fi strategy simulation game by Simon Roth. The game is currently in Alpha however it seems to be very pre-alpha at the moment. The game has a lot of potential but is lacking a few features right now. One of the biggest issues I have seen is the ability to save, right now there is no saving feature. With that, it doesn’t matter how far you have progress, in the end you have to start over again. There are a few glitches where your Colonist and Robot worker will ether stop working or would not complete tasks assign to them. The tutorial of the game is very limited but having them pop up is the annoying part.The good thing is that if they brought out updates and improvement it might become a great game. However, so far it has been 22 days since the steam launch and it has had zero updates so far. If that changes or the game get better I may have to come back and change my review. This review is based on what is available during this stage of the alpha.  "

								Maia is a space colony building game, it has great potential and can be the next colony building game. However it is currently in the stages of development, it laggs like crazy when the performance is on high, and it has very little content in it! You can play this game for maybe 10-30 minutes maximum, and then youll be bored. It currently has no save option, and it only has a ""creative"" mode, where everything is buildable, and nothing costs anything. The game has many bugs, and few features. Do not buy this game unless you are trying to help the devs and give constructive critisim, to help them make the game the way the community likes it! I will not make another review untill more features have been added.			"

								Think it's time to update a review of this game.  It's rare to have a responsive dev so I better take advantage.  The I.M.P. is much improved, no trouble with it ignoring orders.  However there is issue related to the I.M.P. but not really the I.M.P.s fault.  after it gets done digging it just stays there and when you build a room there's a good chance it'll get stuck inside a wall.  You can avoid that by giving it a dig order some where else so it'll move away but you have to remeber to do it and sooner or later I always forget.  I think the best way to fix this would be to program the I.M.P. to automatically go to the nearest storage unit and wait there when it completes any job it has so it will be safely out of the way and I won't need to remember.  Another fix would be the ability to destroy rooms.  As far as I know you can't destroy rooms but I havn't chaecked the tutorial in forever so I might be wrong on that.  There are two other concernes.  I notice after a long while the colonists seem to lose focus on building blueprints.  This only seems to happen after the base gets pretty big so it might be because they are busy repairing things, not sure if repairing is prioritized over building.  In future plays I'll try and remeber to use more than one repair drone and see if that helps.  The other thing is the windmills.  They keep falling down.  I always put turrets by my windmills so I'm pretty sure it's not wild life getting them.  Often times it happens so fast I don't think it normal wear and tear, I'm lucky if I get two days out of them.  Solar arrays are working great though just don't forget to use generators so you get power through the night and the generators are working perfectly in my experiance.  Happy to see the progress this game has made,  Thats all for now.			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly I think I should explain what the game is, its an early access version of a hard sci fi colony sim, very similar in play style to Dungeon Keep. It features I.M.P that are robot versions of imps from Dungeon Keep, they will mine what you select for mining. Your colonists build your rooms and items in them, as well as grow crops, research and all that jazz. Maia is also hard sci fi, the colonists sweat and burn calories when working, the more calories they burn the more food they need to eat. All this is simulated in the game, so you need to get your food correct and it takes time to grow so planning and learning is needed.Lots of updates to the game since it launched on early access, there is at least 1 sizeable update a month. Its is very stable at the moment, runs very well and no major crashes. Its very much an alive game.The AI has been improved drastically in the last few updates, they no longer seem to want to die, still a way to go with them, but they are very much do what you think they would at the moment.The UI is the biggest stumbling block in the game. I kinda like it, but I can understand people that don't. Its very hands off, you know what is going on by seeing it. If a colonist is shivering and you see their breath, then the air is cold. You know the air quality of a room by screens that can be built, there is no overlay or any information readily available to the player. Also in the construction menu, there are no images, you have to scroll through a list of options with the keyboard, its easy to miss things. I would like a slide out panel that had images and you can select it but you get used to the way of it soon enough.			"

Early Access Review
								So far, this game seems pretty good. Of course, you can never really tell with Early Access games, but first impression is it's allright. Not exceptionally awesome, but pretty good. I'd even say at least slightly above average. It was definitaly worth the money and you get pretty much everything that's being advertised. What suprised me most is that, unlike many other alpha-games, this game has exceptionally little and few bugs. Sure, you get the occasional crash (at least on win10), which can be frustrating if you haven't saved in a long time, sometimes colonists get stuck and die, object ""health"" sometimes becomes negative which will result in the object not getting any repairs ever but all this happens rather rarely and doesn't really have too much of a disrupting influence. All in all, i'm pretty glad i've bought this game.quick summary:+ rather bug free+ you get everything that you see in the trailer+ the game can be played almost without any disturbances+ no game-breaking bugs (at least none that i encountered)- no autosave (at least not that i know of)- game sometimes crashes (at least on win10)so i'd say, if you don't mind running into small bugs occasionally or (seemingly) random game-crashes and you like the game's concept, go ahead and buy it, even if it's just to support the developer.

								Okay. A lot of people have been talking bad things about this game. I strongly disagree. Not only is this game fun to play but it has very few major issues or bugs that are noticeable. Sure this game has been in Early Access for a long time but I know I would rather have a finished game than an unfinished one. This is an indie title, they don't have money to spend on hundreds of coders and artists to speed up the process. This is a fantastic game and although it's difficult I have had great fun playing it.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game a couple of years ago. I've kind have regretted it honestly. There is so much broken about the AI, it is unplayable. Colonists  will not do what you need them to to survive. The pace of development is an absolute crawl, and I would never have put the game out in the current state it's in unless it was free. I really believe the developer needs to get bigger/better team together in order to get this game into a playable state. I've been holding on strong for a while with hope that the next update will bring needed bug fixes in a timely manner. I always retrun to play for about 30 minutes. Then I slowly close my laptop in frustration. I've been doing this ever since I bought it.What this game does have: A wonderful atmosphere. Great sounds, looks, and a bit of British humor.What this game does not have: A purpose of completion. I get the point of survival, but where do we go after that? Maybe I've just never gotten to that point yet. Even so, the AI needs a huge overhaul to prevent weird oddities. (Priorities maybe? They're starving and won't build the planters, but they'll make 1000 solar panels in the meantime, so they obviously have enough building materials!)			"

								New review before Maia hits the 0.6 beta milestone.Maia is, without a doubt, shaping up to be one of my all time greatest games - and that's no small accolade!Any game that can confidently call itself 'hard science' and back it up with realistic simulation and strong physics (science not game) is well worth a look, but combining that with a very British sense of humour and noticeable influences from some of the greatest games of all time is a combination that's very hard to beat...If you do one thing for yourself going into 2017, it should be purchasing early-access to MAIA and watching its development closely.

Early Access Review
								- Updated 2016-12-15 -I definitely appreciate the continued updates to this game. I got a bit of time to get back into the latest patch (0.59) and really enjoyed many of the expanded options that the game presents. I get a lot more colonist deaths than I used to, which created stress to deal with the many problems - a very good thing in a game like this. I also managed to turn that flagging base around and down a more stable path, which was a huge sense accomplishment as everyone stopped dieing!I'm looking forward to capturing one of the native fauna that can be domesticated and using it to supplement the base rations.Every update has added blancing changes that make aspects of the simulation more interesting, and major features are added quite often that change aspects of how I've played the game. I still recommend this game, as it often makes me wish I had more time to play it.- End Update 2016-12-15 -I really enjoy this little base building & management game. I absolutely love that the development team works to publish regular updates to the game about once per month; each time adding neat new features (it's an alpha!) and working through the known bugs that have been reported and reproducible.In particular, I love the heat simulation and new room layout mechanism in the most recent update. The former adds a layer of management detail that is complementary to other base needs, while the latter presents a more intuitive and visual way of ""painting"" the layout of your base than the existing system (you placed entire room tiles with a click). Then they worked to add in color a color picker for the lights, which affects the colonists' moods and plant growth rates. Oh and a brand new scripted mission to play through. So, plenty of new features each month to go along with learning what exactly it is your colonists need to stay alive and form a self-sufficient colony.I've definitely enjoyed the open development of this game. Each update has been great and added several new toys to play with.			"

The biting irony is awesome. Simon Roth is very open in sharing information about progress.

								Reviewed: Alpha 0.58 - 16th Oct 2016TL;DRDon't buy it until the AI/pathfinding got a lot better, or it's on sale for <10 USD.It has a lot of potential, the core elements are there, and there are some interesting gimmicks but it needs to get better to be enjoyable IMHO.---------I WANT TO BELIEVE *insert X-files joke here*I'm a sucker for survival/build-up games (logging ~1500 hrs in Space Enginners alone) and I've been watching & wishlisting this title for two years now.Infrequently I've been visiting the store page of this title but was always repelled by the mixed reviews, their contents and reasons.But this weekend was a 50% off special, so 'out of boredom' I finally picked it up, especially since in version Alpha 0.58 ""AI has been tremendiously overhauled and improved"".I like the aspect that you do not directly control your crew in this game, you do have control over the IMP humanoid-bots and repair-bots, but you do not specifically tell your crew what they're doing when.That's good in my books.But it's not good if crew-members get stuck in the middle of a Workbench, or behind walls or in Atmosphere Generators. Also not good is when crewmembers infrequently dying of dehydration, even though there's like three half-full water-tanks to drink from.What this game needs is an overhaul of the UIX; when every ~20 seconds a full-screen displayed warning been thrown into your face - stealing the focus - bcause your veggie-farms needing to be pitched, you're slowly turning into the infamous meme of fire-breathing Pepe, yelling at your monitor.Frequently I had to abandon & restart my early-games, because of key crew-members being stuck, trapped or clipping into stuff. Like, remotely controlling a repair-bot. it's easily to drive it through walls, but you'll never get it back out of there, being stuck. you can't disassemble it because your crew-members can't reach it. Also frequently you're giving build orders (for outside placed Wind-Turbines or Solarpanels) and your crew-members aren't building them, even though all prerequsites are met.Unfortunately I haven't gotten too far, since my people turned after a longer game frequently into lemmings, throwing themselves into the arms of death due to starvation and/or dehydration despite an abundance of available food and water.It's also lacking are more - ""general oversight"" in terms of a grid's power needs/utilization and easier indicators what your crewmember is needing/lacking. after all they got voices, so they could tell you. (No they don't tell you when they're dehydrating and about to keel over).This being an Early Access title, you're hereby warned. I can see where this game is going with its potential. The dev team is a small one with three on-site staff and three external contractors, which explains why their progress is so slow, especially considering the complexity and intricacies of this type of games; and it seems they developed their own engine for this, instead of using a middleware like UNITY.VERDICT: buy when <10 USD or when AI/pathfinding has drastically improved. Until then; No.			"

								This game has a lot of great potential. It's an Alpha right now and it shows. AI improvements should be priority #1 over texture/graphics improvements. Structure placement (i.e. placing hydroponics or beds) should be #2. I had a colony die because a hole opened up in the ground under one of my bulkhead doors and destroyed it, effectively cutting off my hydroponics room from the rest of the colony with 3 colonists trapped inside. I routed some new doors through another part of the complex but the colonists just wouldn't build them. So basically everyone on the outside of the hydroponics room starved to death, everyone on the inside died of fatigue because they couldn't make it to the beds. I hope there is a better save option in the next update, because crashes are going to hapen often. Also, my robot keeps getting stuck places and just stands there even though I give him a clear path and give new orders. Sometimes it gets stuck if it wanders into a spot where a colonist is building something. In my last game, mine got stuck inside the materials hopper.I'm going to give this a recommendation because I can see where the developers want to take it, in hopes that they actually follow through and dont end the project in favor of another.

								I'm a fan of this genre of game, way back from Sim City and Startopia. This game had a lot of promise to me: science fiction setting, resource management challenges, etc.Unfortunately I can't recommend it. I've done the tutorial now 8 times and it always ends one of two ways: the one mining robot mining as instructed and getting crushed to death in a cave in, meaning no mining and no resource production; or the mining robot doesn't get crushed but the colonists all stand idly about not building the heaters and atmosphere generators they need to live, while power and materials are available.I even tried playing without the tutorial, doing basic game starts without the tutorials guidance, and they all end the same way: my colonists freeze and suffocate while doing nothing to help themselves, no matter what is available to them. It's pretty boring, because the game pace is pretty slow, watching the colonists freeze to death.These failed starts don't count the failed starts due to the clunky interface: you frequently end up unbuilding things that have been built, crucial doorways and room sections disappear with one false click, mislicked false starts on construction can't be cleaned up and started over.No way the game is ready for prime time. But I bought it, and tried too hard so I can't give it back, so I guess I'll check back in a couple of years and see if it's been updated.			"

								Based on the addition of new content from 0.42 to 0.48 instead of addressing core interface issues I am no longer optimistic about this game's development. The game still feels pointless, there doesn't seem to be any way to prioritize certain actions over others for your colonists. You end up querying items like the Atmos processor and material hopper constantly to see how much stuff you have on hand. There is little feedback about how you are meeting or failing to meet colonists needs.I do like the goal of this game, the graphics, and the sense of humor but it feels like ""shiny"" updates are being prioritized over core functionally.I'd really like this game to prove me wrong and turn into a sensational game, but based on it's past year of development, I really doubt it.

Rooms cost nothing to build and take a split second.material is magically turned into portable solar panels,.Placement:Sometimes I cannot remove room blocks, they light up but when I try to cancel them they won't go away. New game...Construction:Seems they like to construct solar panels more than they like to construct the windmills, the flare happens nearly immidiatly at random game and they all die because of power problems even though I have instructed them to build windmills and there is sufficient material left.Pace:Time feel its a litle bit fast, when I have made up my mind of where I want everything and instructed to robot to make room for base they have already died in some way, either lack of air or freezing to death.

								I *LOVE* this game.  The improvements that are made in each monthly update, have been a great and very consistantly steady progression. Early Access:If you used to be an Early Access believer but then had bad experiences that caused you to lose the faith, this game is a great one to help get that feeling back again. If feels pretty nice to belive in a game and actually have the developer live up to those hopes we have for what it could be next month, and then the next and so on. I feel like it's getting harder to find Early Access experiences where that still happens. I am SO glad I got this game. It's worth it for the regained trust in Early Access games alone.Linux Support:I really appreciate the Linux support. Recent Example: The linux version had an important issue with it when it was released yesterday. We mentioned it to Simon and he had it fixed within 24hours. I have other games in my library, written by large teams, that have a much larger linux base asking for fixes, which are still basically unplayable (for linux and mac users, anyway) many months later. I would say I wish Simon was working for those guys so some of my other games would get this level of care as well, but I'm actually quite glad he's working on Maia because this game really deserves to have a developer working on it that really cares.Communication:I highly recommend checking out the discussion pages as well as his website. He has been really great at working with the player base to make sure the updates contain the fixes that we care about the most and he is very transparent with what he is working on next, so you never have to guess if the thing you care about is something he is already working on or not.Is it finished?Nooooo... Don't be confused about that, it is Early Access (Currently at 0.59 as I'm writing this review). There are lots of things he is still working on and little oddities that he doesn't like.  You will still have frustrating little moments watching your colonists do something rediculous that gets them killed now and then. The difference is that after watching the update progressions up to this point, I can now just laugh when those silly things happen, knowing that, in a few updates they won't be happening anymore.  (Which is unfortunately not something I can say for quite a few of the other games I own). "

								Promising game. If you like the idea of a space colony survival strategy, this is worth a shot! This is still Alpha stage of development but seems updates have been coming regularly. It's an ambitious title so still a fair way off release.Also the lead developer's videos and blog posts are worth following and supporting!			"

								I've owned this game about 8 months now (don't let me play time fool you it doesn't track my offline time) the devolper speaks with the players and even makes custom fixes for peoples problems - which I find impressive - he goes out of his way to stay with his vision of the game BUT also blends in player requests so that his dream for the game builds on what the players wants which makes it a solid game concept.it is early release with a small team so if you want a game with 2-4 updates a month this isnt' for you - if you want a solid game with tons of hope that you actually can ask for stuff with a actual chance for it to get in - this is your gamethere is some cons I won't lie to you - its got some bugs - colonist seem to be sucidal at times refuseing to eat drink and die - the robot miners seem to get confused - and the space chickens seem to hate me - but that said each game update I have fewer complaints and so much new and cool things are addedI was worried 8 months ago when I bought this game - but now I'd definatly have purchased it with a smile. - I might not be a fanboy of this game - but if the devolper keeps it up I might have to convert			"

								In it's current format, Maia is not a playable game. I would say that it is currently in VERY early Alpha stages. Graphics are up and running (for the most part), but that's about it. The actual gameplay is not really implemented, and the parts that are there are not easy to figure out. There's no way to change the settings, no way to look at the key mapping (a critical thing in any new game), and it's really just trial and error.I'd advise putting Maia on your Wishlist and waiting for about 6 months or so. It looks like it has a lot of potential, but it has a way to go before it's even in an Early Access playable form.			"

								This review is of the game in ALPHA stages: Potential exists but don't purchase it yet.Every once in a while you find a developer that understand what early Early access means and understands that it does not mean crowd source fundraising.Not everything will work in Alpha and that is fine -- however there should be some minimum expectations. As of right now there are some ridiculous bugs/issues that I noticed within the first 20 mins of play including the following:- Turning on/off text effects do not work properly (text effects are very annoying and distracting)- The exit button does not work.- Camera functions are not smooth on high end machine (i7 / GTX 908ti / 16GB)There are options that should be available for use in an alpha that are not:- Video options are extremely limited and are extremely slow to respond to adjustments- No Gamma correction and this game tends to be a bit darkBy the time the developer is receiving money from players, the core game enviornment should be stable and workable enough to determine what else needs to be done in order to enable the community to provide usefull feedback. This is not the case and adding features should not be the priority when the enviornment is not stable and the GUI is clumsy at best.My guess is they are running out of money and are getting desperate.

Early Access Review
								Fantastic game despite not being playable for any prolonged period in its current state. The game is constantly improving with changes having positive impact and is responsive to player feedback. Can't really ask for more from a game in Alpha.Maia is basically a base management game with survival elements and will be even better once more content is added and the bugs ironed out. At present there are actually a surprisingly low number of bugs but the main one that gets me everytime is the deaths from your colonists just deciding to stop moving and eventually dehydrate or starve (whichever comes first). This wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't a cap on the number of colonists meaning they don't get replaced. Eventually everyone will be dead and with nobody replaced the base can't get bigger as more people would be required. For an early access game it's a good problem to have as it will be fixed eventually. General gameplay is still really fun and oddly stable. I would recommend this game to anybody that can overllok bugs at this stage and wants to try iterations of build orders etc to try to get a perfect base. Just be aware that you will fail regardless of how well you plan at this stage.			"

								A rich and detailed interplanetary colonization game that is as difficult as it is enjoyable. Start a colony from scratch with just enough to survive. Manage expanding the base with the complex energy, water, and oxygen needs of both the colonists and base itself. Perform vasts amounts of research (that the colonists decide on, not the player, which actually makes the game more interesting and unpredictable) that improve every aspect of the base, colonists, and robotics that help around the colony. And that's barely scratching the surface!Don't let the Early Access scare you, Simon Roth and Machine Studios are one of the few that actually get it right. They put out constant updates in content and are qutie open with the community across social media. It's not hard to find out what's new, what's coming next, and what they have planned for the future.I would STRONGLY recommend this game and look forward to see everything that they add to it in the future.

Hold off buying it if you're not prepared to put up with some of its issues though.			"

Early Access Review
								It seems this game doesn't do a good job of showing what it is/is not.Maia *is not* a game where you can micro-manage people, fiddle with spreadsheets and build queues.Maia *is* a game where you try to build a base with (and for) a bunch of colonists that will allow them to survive on a hostile alien world. The colonists handle (most) prioritisation of tasks, they handle what they will and will not build, they handle most of their needs; the game is working out what rooms or equipment they need to fulfill those needs and explore the world they have landed on, without dying.The lack of build queues is not a bug, the lack of spreadsheets containing task prioritisations and other ways to fiddle is not a bug. The developer has (rightly) decided these things exist in other games to patch over bad AI and we have just normalised them. In software development these things are called 'leaky abstractions' and are not desirable.It's been a long, hard slog to get the AI to the point where it works properly (AI is hard, BTW) and doesn't eventually do something dumb and kill itself, but with 0.61 I think we're at the point where it works pretty well.The one big minus with this game seems to be usability: the game doesn't show the player what it is (note: I don't use the word 'explain' here), meaning users have the expectation of spreadsheets and tweaking, and the build menus are cumbersome and slow to use.Maia is also working great for me on Linux (AMD/Mesa drivers). Simon Roth also is an alright bloke who's genuinely dedicated to finishing his game.==============Original, stupid review, which I still stand behind:Simon Roth is a great man, he has great hair. The best hair, everybody knows that. He has the best hair in gaming and he likes me a lot. Everyone likes me especially Simon Roth and his hair.I predicted Maia is going to be a great game, and it is, it is. 0.61 is the best game from early access in 2013 that might be released in 2017. That's what I said back in 2012 and I was right. And you know what goes into games like this? A lot of good stuff. Like Frustum Culling. Good stuff. Great hair. And I predicted that, and I was right.			"

								I have been playing this game for 6 hours. Long story short: The concept is fascinating, but the implementation is extremely buggy, and there are bugs you would not expect after 3 years development.Playing was fun sometimes, but there were lots of extremely frustrating moments. I would recommend to try it though: While I don't think it its worth its money now, I still hope the developer will start thinking ""top-down"" eventually, leave sound and graphics alone (they are really nice already) and fix the basic stuff that prevents this from being playable.  I've managed to play through for more than an hour, but 50 % of launches crash in the first few seconds.  The UI is not intuitive, but it's easy once you get it.  Some basic stuff is not working e.g. pathfinding: NPCs run through walls and other obstackes or get stuck  It is not obvious why a task is not executed (e.g. which resource is missing)  In one of my games, at some point there was nothing more to do.  I gave up when all of a sudden both the mouse pointer and lighting failed globally (black screen with just a few icons, unable to do anything)I would strongly suggest getting help from an experienced SW developer.

Early Access Review
								Maia is a nice approach to all the survival and base building games and it has a sci fi setting. Given SciFi it does not do magic but is more a ""hard scifi"" kind of game. The airflow e.g. is modeled realisticly and solar storms disturb your communications and energy transfers.You cannot control your colonists directly (that technology has yet to be discovered) so it adds a feel of the Sims to the game. In result when the game tells you that it is dangerous going out, guess what some of your colonists suddenly urge to do? Right, head out to the danger zone! On every corner you will see the developers humor integrated into the game, great!The developer, Simon Roth, updates regularly and is very transparent in his development and progress. The game still has some issues, but given the alpha state, it is already pretty playable. Bugs are hotfixed and the support for Linux is actively supported. I, for one, am really looking forward to the 1.0 release.			"

								This ""game"" simply doesn't work.  It plays for a confusing, aimless five or so minutes, then crashes without explaination.  It's a cool idea, and graphically looks nice, but the dev seems to have bitten off WAY more than he can chew.  I follwed this game since way before it came to Steam, abd was excited when it did, but all this time later, no progress has been made, and infact, it may have gotten worse.  I don't want to come down on the dev. He seems like a genuinely nice guy, and to care about this project, but after all this time, with nothing to show for it, I can't help but think he's simply not up to the task this game presents.Verdict: No point in spending $25 on something that you can't, and might never be able to play.

								I've been struggling to reach a stable point with a colony for a long time with Maia, preventing death from starvation, exhausation or stupidity before you can establish a sustainable base seems extremely challenging. It was during one of these frustrating attemps that I stumbled upon the secret backstory to Maia.This isn't a game about society's elite heading into the stars to colonise new and interesting planets. This is a society's eugenics program in action. They have rounded up all of the lazy, the stupid, and the generally incompetent and shipped them off to some godforsaken planet with just enough resources to survive. They figured it was more humane than outright execution.So bear this in mind when playing Maia, whenever you start screaming at the colonists to stop running from room to room staring at walls and go build that *******! solar array before they freeze to death, just relax and remember that you're the last hope of these plucky underdogs that have been abandoned by their society.

								I've been following this game for some time and when is came onto Early Access I was very excited by the concept. However since then I have become a bit disillusioned with it. But I will provide a fair judgement of it in its current state and the developers. The game does have amazing charm, almost all the tech in the game is not far from what we have now and this gives the game a fantastic sense of realism. Even the charecters are dressed to match what you would expect and the game has a fantastic sense of humour in the little info pop ups. Base construction is intresting placing rooms and then decorating them freeform does give a great sense of personalisation (beware OCD people out there, trying to place things dead on is a nightmare, I suffered!). The world outside your underground home feels alive in the style it has been done in with various creatures who may pose a challenge to you. And they accompany the various events such as earthquakes that keep the game fresh and intresting. Managing the various resources is also given a sense of realism such as managing air production and flow, heat, food and such and the devices used are, as I've said, realistic in design the type of thing you would see in a building today. Futhermore the game's developers are fairly active and updates are common but nothing really seems to make serious progress forward. However this sense of realism is compounded by the fact the game is buggy as hell. I cannot reason the A.I of your people who seeminly act at random if at all. They will often die standing in a room that has no heaters set up yet while the room next door is fully heated. Getting them do to anything is a chore and I have often had people die early on because they take so long constructing the basics. The tutorial is terrible, I thought that all you needed as the atmos gens to sort our heating and the like, but while the tutorial gets you to build one it does not get you build the heaters meaning by the time you realise you really really need to, coupled with the time it takes the A.I to do anything, it might be too late. The U.I is not very helpful with nothing immediatly displayed on the screen meaning on your first go you wont even know how much elect, water and such you have until it runs out. I like where the developer is trying to take it however, being able to read your peoples E-mails is a great idea and again adds to the personalisation. But at the moment is fails to give the player what they need. The colonists work independent of the player, but sometimes it is needed to force construction of an item or activity and if there is a way to do this I havn't found it. If you need to build a turbine for an emergency power drop, but have other actions already in place your a little screwed. All in all the game has a great feel to it and that is why I am reccomending it, to keep and eye on it but not to buy. Previous versions of this game were more enjoyable and to me more stable and that is a shame but hopefully this is due to them implimenting the game proper and this is just a rough patch. As I said a game to follow not to wishlist.			"

								My playtime is low because I don't want to spoil the game for myself and am waiting for the campaign to come in.That said, this game has a gorgeous aesthetic, a lovely dry sense of humour and a laser focus on its simulationist approach. The development has been extensively documented in patch notes and regular video updates and show excellent prioritisation from the tiny dev team.			"

								This games is witty, interesting, Initially challenging and very definitly still in development. I'd reccomend it as is because I feel that I got my monies worth but with several caveats: The learning curve is steep but ultimatly shallow at the moment.Your only challenge is surviving both your ignorance and the enviroment so several features feel redundent.It is very definitly in development despite the amount of time it has been EA, since 2013, having said that the dev is very involved with the community, posting updates of good quality.TLDR cool, original game with a great deal of complexity and some depth whilst also being buggy and at times frustrating.

								I've been struggling to reach a stable point with a colony for a long time with Maia, preventing death from starvation, exhausation or stupidity before you can establish a sustainable base seems extremely challenging. It was during one of these frustrating attemps that I stumbled upon the secret backstory to Maia.This isn't a game about society's elite heading into the stars to colonise new and interesting planets. This is a society's eugenics program in action. They have rounded up all of the lazy, the stupid, and the generally incompetent and shipped them off to some godforsaken planet with just enough resources to survive. They figured it was more humane than outright execution.So bear this in mind when playing Maia, whenever you start screaming at the colonists to stop running from room to room staring at walls and go build that *******! solar array before they freeze to death, just relax and remember that you're the last hope of these plucky underdogs that have been abandoned by their society.

I can see ""Dungeon-Keeper"" and ""Evil-Genius'"" trade mark right there and perhaps the ""The Sims"" as well.I've only managed to get as far as  sussesfully adding a Workshop room with two of three Work-Desks and Two Working Lights before the Robot who digs the rooms out just froze and then started to move around in small circles depsite being given orders to dig out another room. It's the only thing in this game that can do this. Apart from retreive the rocks, rubble and other detrius from where he deposited after digging. Not much else could be done beyond this.According to what I had been intructed to do in order to continue playing the game. I had to build a work shop with a desk and a light. 3 by 3 squares is the mnimum size requirement. For starters.Thw rokshop is need to be built first before anything else can be done.In previous gaming session, I had tried to make bigger rooms and had marked out acouple of them to be cleared as well as trying to furnish the other rooms as well  as outside. This was mistake. Evryhting should be done slowly and sectiojn by section or else pople start dying (Aphyxiation or Mal-nourishment.)and they need to be replaced and the robot just stops moving. Refusing to do anything. On two occsions, he got caught between the wall where it had been digging and the wall of the room that had been built by the human working on top of him. So, I need to be careful to let the robot do what it can first before the humans  perform their duties.I think this needs to be addressed.I might add a video later.Looking forward to the finished product.

								In this game I like how you have to mine for resources and can build new rooms that contribute in different ways to the survival of the colonists. I also like how building a new room will give you access to new objects that you can construct. The AI of the robot and colonists needs to be improved. I don't know how far you can go in the game because I have always had to restart because of colonists not building objects that I place after I've spent some time in the new game, or the robot not mining out an area that I've assigned it, or because the characters get stuck in eachother. I'm sure that this will be fixed in the updates to come, but these issuse shouldn't stop you from getting this game because despite these issues, I enjoy playing this game and I recommend it.			"

That's when it launches properly, a third of the time it crashes to desktop. When the game does work however, it shows a lot of promise. I will be keeping track of the development and new updates, at the moment the game is confusing and lacking in customisation options (textures, graphics, sound etc.) I wouldn't say Maia is a must buy in it's current state, but if anything in the game seems interesting to you it could be worth  a purchase.

								It said early access and it is, the game concept has a lot of potential and i look forward to new updates.As for now. the 0.40 is not much more than a tech demo that shows a few parts of the game mechanics and basically works as a sandbox to test the implemented features for example machines need way to much maintenance and natural disasters like earthquakes or solar flares? happen in a row. But that's not a problem, balancing of features is an beta thing, currently its alpha that means basic features are just implemented right now.As for the current 0.40 state the game will not satisfy someone who is looking for an actual game with content, it is much more of a test build but it sure looks promising for everyone who wants to get a picture of the game mechanics.

								This games is witty, interesting, Initially challenging and very definitly still in development. I'd reccomend it as is because I feel that I got my monies worth but with several caveats: The learning curve is steep but ultimatly shallow at the moment.Your only challenge is surviving both your ignorance and the enviroment so several features feel redundent.It is very definitly in development despite the amount of time it has been EA, since 2013, having said that the dev is very involved with the community, posting updates of good quality.TLDR cool, original game with a great deal of complexity and some depth whilst also being buggy and at times frustrating.

								I've been struggling to reach a stable point with a colony for a long time with Maia, preventing death from starvation, exhausation or stupidity before you can establish a sustainable base seems extremely challenging. It was during one of these frustrating attemps that I stumbled upon the secret backstory to Maia.This isn't a game about society's elite heading into the stars to colonise new and interesting planets. This is a society's eugenics program in action. They have rounded up all of the lazy, the stupid, and the generally incompetent and shipped them off to some godforsaken planet with just enough resources to survive. They figured it was more humane than outright execution.So bear this in mind when playing Maia, whenever you start screaming at the colonists to stop running from room to room staring at walls and go build that *******! solar array before they freeze to death, just relax and remember that you're the last hope of these plucky underdogs that have been abandoned by their society.

But i don't mind. (not like a lot of other ea games that i wasted money on) This game, i am sure of it, will be finished one day. And it will be great! The Dev is very commited and every update improves the game more and more. I enjoy coming back to it.people complain about the lack of content and bug and that it takes too long ... again it is ONE guy and it's a bloody alpha ... so don't buy if u want a finished product ... but buy if u like to support a commited dev and an awesome game, that u can enjoy somewhere in the future!

Early Access Review
								I've been following this game for some time and when is came onto Early Access I was very excited by the concept. However since then I have become a bit disillusioned with it. But I will provide a fair judgement of it in its current state and the developers. The game does have amazing charm, almost all the tech in the game is not far from what we have now and this gives the game a fantastic sense of realism. Even the charecters are dressed to match what you would expect and the game has a fantastic sense of humour in the little info pop ups. Base construction is intresting placing rooms and then decorating them freeform does give a great sense of personalisation (beware OCD people out there, trying to place things dead on is a nightmare, I suffered!). The world outside your underground home feels alive in the style it has been done in with various creatures who may pose a challenge to you. And they accompany the various events such as earthquakes that keep the game fresh and intresting. Managing the various resources is also given a sense of realism such as managing air production and flow, heat, food and such and the devices used are, as I've said, realistic in design the type of thing you would see in a building today. Futhermore the game's developers are fairly active and updates are common but nothing really seems to make serious progress forward. However this sense of realism is compounded by the fact the game is buggy as hell. I cannot reason the A.I of your people who seeminly act at random if at all. They will often die standing in a room that has no heaters set up yet while the room next door is fully heated. Getting them do to anything is a chore and I have often had people die early on because they take so long constructing the basics. The tutorial is terrible, I thought that all you needed as the atmos gens to sort our heating and the like, but while the tutorial gets you to build one it does not get you build the heaters meaning by the time you realise you really really need to, coupled with the time it takes the A.I to do anything, it might be too late. The U.I is not very helpful with nothing immediatly displayed on the screen meaning on your first go you wont even know how much elect, water and such you have until it runs out. I like where the developer is trying to take it however, being able to read your peoples E-mails is a great idea and again adds to the personalisation. But at the moment is fails to give the player what they need. The colonists work independent of the player, but sometimes it is needed to force construction of an item or activity and if there is a way to do this I havn't found it. If you need to build a turbine for an emergency power drop, but have other actions already in place your a little screwed. All in all the game has a great feel to it and that is why I am reccomending it, to keep and eye on it but not to buy. Previous versions of this game were more enjoyable and to me more stable and that is a shame but hopefully this is due to them implimenting the game proper and this is just a rough patch. As I said a game to follow not to wishlist.			"

								This game looks like it has a lot of potential and I look forward to seeing how it progresses.It should be made VERY clear though: at the moment this is more of a concept demonstration than a game... I'd say game play totals no more than 5 minutes.  'Early Access' is really a concept that's taken off big time this year and it can mean huge variation; there are games out there (example: Project Zomboid) which you can sink many dozens of hours into and others which are really just proof of concept.  Until the terminologies catrch up to describe the differences anyone looking for a playable game should always be aware of this before buying. "

Early Access Review
								I want to recommend this game but right now it has a few fundamental problems that need to be addressed. The good thing is that they are all problems that can be fixed. The main issues are kind of tied together, the lack of visual feedback and the clunky interface. To give you a basic example, when you start a game there are a few tasks that need to be dealt with right way, get a power supply going and get heat and atmosphere generating up and running. So you go to slap down some wind turbines outside and a atmosphere generator inside. The first problem comes when you have to actually pick those things from the menu, instead of having menus that you pick things from you instead have to cycle through every buildable object(a list which changes depending on what room the mouse cursor is over.) to get to the one you need. It is clunky and is the kind of design choice that seems super streamlines and easy on paper but in actual fact is far less efficient than just having a menu of items. Take Prison Architect, if I want to build something it is only two clicks away (One to open the menu, another to select the object) but here it can be anywhere between 1 to 10 clicks to get the thing I want. The other problem is the lack of visual feedback on things. I like that you get emails from the people on base, they are well written and honestly help to bring the game to life. The main problem again comes back to building things, if we continue that previous example we have placed down all the things that need to be built. Now all I can do is wait for the stuff to get built. I cannot set priorities on things and there is not a job list so I can see what is going to be getting done next. This could be solved with some kind of way to tell if a job is quede, someone is moving to work on it or they are actually working on it. It is hard to explain how frustrating it is to watch people wander around, freezing to death because none of them will just go outside and build the bloody wind turbine so they have some power. It may be that there is a reason they are not going outside but I am not seeing it. If it is something that is buried in the emails that they send then that is a problem. the emails are fun but they are also too long, you cannot just skim them to get the gist of something, you have to stop and spend time reading them and when there are other things pressing on you that is really not something you should be doing. I really want this game to get better, as I said at the top, none of the problems the game has are beyond saving. Unlike other EA games there are no fundamental problems with the game that could only be fixed by starting from scratch. The foundations of the game are solid and it has a charming sense of humour that makes me want to stick with it but it needs some basic work. I hope to revisit this review down the road and change my verdict.			"

								Sadly the negative reviewers either failed to understand principles behind early access and the development cycle.Does the game have bugs and sometimes become unstable?, yes. This is because the game is still in development, the developmer is pretty quick to fix issues.As for grouping units and so on, it's not that sort of game. Your role is to set orders for build, maintain your base and those inside.The game is still early in development, I would suggest those looking for a complete game, lacking in patience, wanting a polished product to wait for release.I really enjoy the game, especially after the last patch.  Still have much to learn with resource management and and the more technologically advanced bits and bobs.Really interested to see where this game is heading. As stated above, if you're unsure wait for a few more content patches, read forums and ask questions to see how the game is coming along.			"

								I can see where the game is going from this. I like what I see.One thing to keep in mind is that this game is in alpha. Now I know a lot of people go, ""Oh I'm a software developer, I know what alpha is! This isn't it!"" Those people are dumb and probably liars because, hey, this is the internet. So from a completely normal, non-developer girl: This game is in alpha. It's obviously in alpha. It is not feature complete. There is very little in the way of UI and things people expect to be there (like cancelling orders for objects) are not there.But the concept is there. You can see things working. You can ooh and aah at the pretty graphics because they do look really freaking nice. One thing you can't do is play much. You can't save. Why? It's in alpha. Alphas are not feature complete. They lack many things we've grown used to and honestly take for granted in games. The developer isn't lying to you. They aren't tricking you. They're being very honest that the game is very deep in development. It says that right there on the tin.So if you don't want to see and experience a slice of game development, if you can wait and be patient, or if you hate bugs and incomplete UI... Then don't invest in this right now. If you can't wait, if you like to see a game grow and change, or if you want to help with development then do invest in it.So I'll say it again: I like what I see here. I can't wait for more. I mean, cats in bee suits? Come on. That's gold right there.			"

								This game is fun, but rediculously full of bugs. At this point, I'd HIGHLY suggest saving your money until they get all of the bugs sorted out. I'd suggest buying it if it goes on sale for $10 or less. The game reminds me a lot of Majesty, except, when you tell the builders to build things, they don't even do it half the time or you have to wait at least 30 minutes real life time to build something even when it's necessary AND you even have the materials (for example, the colonists are dying of fatigue, but they won't build beds when I have the materials ready to go). The additional colonists that drop in just sit in front of their landing pod and don't do anything but sit and die. That's how buggy it is. Mostly unplayable at this point. I'm sure it will be a great game when all of it is sorted out, but for the love of all that is good, know what you are getting into if you disregard this advice. FYI, this post is relevent as of the 0.5 update.			"

								UPDATE: Only two versions later, this game is getting more and more fun, and the bug fixes keep rolling in.Keep them rolling in :D....................................................I personally have been looking at this game for over 2 years, and at .57 I bought it.Cool, ok, It's fun and frustrating, and challenging. You have to figure out ways around problems, and force your way through the issues, even that means rocking up a body count. Would be nice to have a higher population numbers count, and some more of a built up base, for the 4 minions you start with, and more tweaks and such, but they will come. Sure it has a long way to go, but i'm keen to see where it goes, is it worth the money, in it's current states NO, BUT! i decided to support the creator, and if more people do, who knows we might actually get it even sooner.

								What is there to say about this very Early Access game. Released too soon? Yes. There is no legend or key to show what the wants and needs of the group members are. All of a sudden a team member is running then dies for no reason. Far far far too much micro managing with absolutely no feedback on whether or not what you are doing is constructive or will cause death. Should be renamed 'build stuff and lose... in space!' Build too many essential things which are needed (turbines) and watch your crew spend all their time maintaining and repairing machines and completely neglecting everything else such as eating or sleeping. Nice concept but a very very long ways left to go on balancing the game play, NPC control, and micromanaging EVERYTHING.			"

								As of Alpha 0.39, I had been following Maia since kickstarter and was really excited to play it and see where it went as I was a dungeon keeper fan. The Alpha is going well, I love the look of it and placement's of tiles. It's missing a save function right now but I believe that is coming soon along with a bunch of other stuff still in the works, kept me entertained for a couple of hour's until I couldn't find much else to do but really looking forward to the future of Maia. Keep it up!			"

								***Updated Review***I last left a review / played this game about 3 years ago. I had many issues with the game then. This time around, the same applied. Still having issues with features of the game working.Here is a list of things I had trouble with during my 4 hour playthrough (which is also up on my Twitch/YT Gaming/Hitbox/Beam profiles):- Colonists move incredibly slow and thus, progressing through a game is excrutiatingly slow.- Placing items/rooms is difficult. I had mined out the rocks between my initial default space and the empty space nearby and I hit a bug in which, I couldn't place any type of room in the given empty space.- During the first mission I had to repeatedly find a new place to setup the microwave transmitter. The transparent showing of the object would be green, assuming to me it was a good position to place the transmitter, but then when placed that ghost object would be red. - Double clicking to prioritize jobs works some of the time I feel. I had the transmitter, some atmos gens and meat trolleys prioritized, but they were not taken care of in time and I failed the mission or my colonists died.- I would like to see smarter AI...If I have my storage room setup with atmos gen and a small heater...I'd kinda expect them to hang out in there most of the time instead of venturing into other parts of the base to then die from cold exposure or asphyxiation.- I had 2 or 3 crash to desktops as well during my 4 hour playthrough.After trying out this game again, I still cannot recommend anyone to pick this up. I'm sure that Simon is the only one developing this game and it has got to be tough, but I am no happier playing now than I was 3 years ago. There have been improvements for sure since my last playthrough, but from alpha 0.1 (or w/e it was when I first played 3 years ago) to Alpha 0,58 there are still issues that I saw 3 years ago not addressed.

								Cannot recommend this game at all. The progress has been so slow and any updates have not improved anything. To make it worse is the price...should only be charging €5 for a game at this very very early stage. Concept and the look and feel of the game are amazing however positve comments end there. You get about 5 minutes into it and charactors appear to just stand motionless for no reason. Also, why can't that robot build stuff? Whats the point of him? Took nearly 3 months to get 1 update out, I know we're supposed to forgive a little when its an early access release, however I expect a bit of participation and activity from the Developers end too.

								Maia is a space building game that is more real then you can believe, you are in control your chooses matter, go to fast you will fail go to slow you will fail, this is what makes Maia that bit different to other games.Simon has been hard at work with patches and bug fixes, if you are thinking on purchasing this game remember it is a early alpha, the team is small but growing the updates are small but I and maybe other player is not in any rush and we enjoy the comunication and replies that Simon does on steam and you tube and the hard work that goes into delveloping a game. I would recommend backing this game and enjoy the journey with the developer, but if you are looking for a completed game then please wait until it is released.			"

								This would be a great game to play except for the slow responce of the AI's and some of the game settings such as Easy (Die every mission) half the items youneed to build to survie Like Oxygen Generators, Wall Heaters, even Power systems take solong to build that all the members of the team are dead before you can build one item. There maybe a nack to how you play this game and survie, but it would be hard to find it unless you made the game. I have played this game too long to get a refund now, if I had known what Iknow now about this game I would have just passed it by. One other thing this game is still in Alfra mode and it's been lie that for 2 yrs, the updates are so far apart and don't seem tochange much in the game at all, if the maker of this game was working on it alone then I guess that would be understandible, as i woud get bored with it as well if it took this long to make, but if theres a team working on it ....Sack Them... and get a team who know how to make a game.

								Edit: Update as of 4th Nov 2015, original review below for posterity and because it still has some valid points. The aforementioned save system works fine now, the game is a lot more stable, and has many more features and content. The AI pathing and priorities are still buggy, but the developer is working on them. The caveat at the bottom still applies, but there is more substance to the game now. Considering it was up until recently a one man dev team, its at least a good effort. Worth peeking at if you can get it on a 50% or more sale, not recommended at full price unless you're a big fan of the game concept and know what you're getting into.---------------------------------------------------A neat game with a good concept, but is nowhere near playable in any respect YET. Currently (as of 19th June 2014) the game lacks such features as working save system, game stability, solid AI pathing, room code management and much more. With more funding/staff or time this game can be amazing, but right now? Don't even.As of current version I recommend this game, with a HUGE caveat; Know what you're getting into: An unfinished, very early alpha of what could possibly be a great game. If you trust the developers wont get sick of the game and run off with the money (anyone remember Towns?) then give it a go and see. If you want a fully functioning game, keep it on the wishlist and wait until it gets out of early access.			"

								Giving this game a thumbs up based on Early Access status.It's fun, 16+ hours in and looking forward to the next update.  If you are looking for a polished game, with no bugs this is not the game for you, but worth putting on  your follow list.Pros: engaging idea, and appeals to my strategy sense.  I like the integration of AI in terms of survival, and building.Cons: The build priority of the colonist is a bit wonkers, and the tools to set priority don't always work.  At times (without cheats) you're at the mercy of what ever the colonist think should be done first.  Often you will find a colonist build a new facility only to have the build the wrong door first, and without additional raw building materials they will dye of hypothermia.That being said I like it, I like it a lot.  I have played several Early Access games and this is one that I will follow regularly.  Is it worth at buy, yes, especially since it is on sale this week.  But be aware it is underdevelopment and you will encounter bugs, and things that don't work as they should.  It's challenging, and entertaining!			"

At this stage it is unplayable and has been for nearly a year (It was released into Early Access around December of 2013).  Save your money until this developer can actually show some promising results.  As it stands, very little progress has been made...			"

								The game is actually a ton of fun, if you happen to be fortunate enough to have the exact configuration the game supports.With an early-access game, I expected AI glitchiness, gameplay mechanics that were unfinished, and occasional crashes.  What i got instead was a game that got me addicted completely during the first session, and then refused to ever launch at all again.  It's incredibly frustrating to see other users reporting the same issues, and the devs continuing to add features and push the game content forward without fixing a game-breaking bug relating to AMD graphics cards.I'm still hopeful that I'll either get a response to my multiple requests for assistance in the forums, or that there will be a fix that makes the game usable again.  Until then, I can't recommend it.			"

								1st day, all animals go for unauthorised space walk, they dont give a damn about Maia, end day log. 2nd day, Wind turbine keeps breaking, mad race by colonists to be the one to fix it, all walk out airlock to repair it and three turn back, end day log. 3rd day, IMP bot walks through rock wall, doesn't return and took our water with it, so damn thirsty, end day log. 4th day, still no sign of the imp bot or our water, but thankfully we have a couch, end day log. NO MORE LOG ENTRIES! This game has plenty of bugs but hey its in alpha and I'd say it is pretty great! If you are into beating your head against the wall until you learn how to prioritise what you need to do this is most certaintly the game for you! Once you've got a strategy going the game becomes even more fun but the colonists need you to hold their hands at times, such as when they are wounded, I had to herd my colonists to the medbay by locking doors, didn't lose anyone but it was kinda annoying. Also if the AI glitches the IMPs movement or colonist movement when it comes to objectives just lock and unlock a door real quick and that seems to fix it, weird huh? But it works so I can't complain! This game reminds me of Space Colony by Firefly and some other developers, if you can manage to get your hands on a copy of that I'd recommend you do so post-haste! ANYWAY, buy this for hours of fun and haikus, and witty doors!			"

								It's not done yet, but I come back every few builds to see very impressive progress. Major patches are more or less monthly, and each one adds some promising feature or refinement.The simulation is very detailed, whichc creates enjoyable emergent gameplay, but can also lead to some frustration when you run into the areas of the game that aren't finished yet. All of your colonists sweating themselves to death (literally), that sort of thing.The humour is solid, of the British understated sort. The haikus are particularly enjoyable.I'm very much looking forward to the upcoming campaign, and the game reaching a solid beta footing. This is a game which is being made right, not fast, and it looks like it will be worth the wait.			"

								Maia has one of my favorite atmospheres in a game. It has an  understated and dark sense of humor that is presented in both gameplay and the item descriptions. It reminds me of a dark, funny, sci-fi Evil Genius. It has lots of small, hidden jokes or easter eggs (like the computer terminal in the Research Lab ) and very amusingly designed systems (like colonists desparately sending you their avante garde music and haikus as pleas for interaction and validation) that show the developer's sense of humor and dedication to world-building. It gives it a strong retro-sci-fi humor vibe and a really enjoyable atmosphere. Particularly after the past two patches, the game has become very stable and many of the AI issues from earlier alpha have been fixed. The game is still difficult (by design) and one should expect a few colony failures before getting the hang of it. It is definitely worthwhile.There are still bugs, but the developer has been very active in quashing them as they are brought to his attention			"

								I like an idea, (I would not buy it otherwise) but at this moment I would advice against buying this game.Technically it is like old good dungeonkeeper but in space. The problem is, controls are so awkward that they turn the game in to the pain to play.Developers should also consider removing that ""digital noise"" filter from the game (or at least have an option to turn it off) because it really does not add any value to the game - it just tires your eyes and makes You wish to turn the game off within first 10 minutes of gameplay.The general guideline is that while games should provide some kind of challage to be interesting that challange should not be in form of bugs and awfull user interface but in a good AI, or challenging story instead.Personally - I was blasted away by the fact that I was somehow removing whole parts of base with just a single click instantly or placing doors randomly without a chance to cancel such ""design errors"".I faced these issues at the time I did this review. These might be resolved some time later.			"

								What can I tell you about Maia? I can tell you that it has sat on my wishlist for quite some time before I bought it during the sale. I have watched with some interest as the game has developed. Having now, albeit briefly, played it for myself I can say that - in it's current state I cannot in any good conscience recommend this to my friends in its current state.That's not to say that Maia hasn't got potential, it certainly has. But the fulfilment of that potential is a long, long way off.The most glaring shortfall here is the staggeringly poor optimisation. All early access excuses aside, this is a game that is charging almost £20 to get players to poke around at what is currently available - the scope of which is very limited, and in my opinion, not especially fun either - for that money I would have expected that the game engine would be in some sort of state that was reasonably optimised for the very broad range of system builds that comes from PC customers. Whilst the game is not unplayable, it's always irksome when a system that vastly exceeds the recommended spec splutters along at 12 frames per second, like some elderly man with a cold. The second issue I had was with the minimalist UI. This is subjective and some people will like it, but for whatever it's worth, I didn't. Having to blindly cycle through construction options using 1-9 and B and V felt unintuitive and was something I can't ever see myself getting used to. That being said, I liked the way I could place items pretty much wherever the hell I wanted in a room, that felt smooth and comfortable to get along with.Another thing that struck me was the very sparce tutorial. Alright, alright, so it's not rocket science this and for the majority of people, there isn't much that is going to need explaining, you can figure stuff out just by playing around with the game, plus it's an alpha, I have yet to see a game in it's alpha state that has a fully fleshed out tutorial. Nonetheless, I feel that the areas covered by the tutorial were hastily put together, and not especially informative.Whilst i'm on the subject of tutorials, the dialogue. Being British myself, I 'get' that whoever wrote the tutorial was attempting  to create the lofty humour of a smug, arrogant ai. However. At the early stages of the game, it's a bit jarring, and doesn't lend itself well to imparting knowledge. Those of you who played Frozen Synapse may remember the tutorial and it's deeply condescending dialogue. That worked for two reasons: 1. It was offset by a more pleasant dialogue as a counter and 2. It was voice acted so it felt like a infinitesimally intelligent ai and not, in the case of Maia, simply the developers quietly sneering at it's customers. In this instance it comes across as not only churlish, and dare I say, a little rude, but also because of it's delivery, entirely misses the target of being funny.Another bone of contention was that there was no feedback to see what was being worked on. Not being one to build one thing at a time, I slapped down a load of stuff and waited. It was hard to tell whether people were working on something, or just running around like lunatics. Another thing is that I had very little feedback on what it was that my colonists needs were at any given time, it would be nice to be able to see a general overview of that at a glance.Maia might be a good game one day if it's devs stick to the plan and don't get too lost in the woods on the way, but it's a long was off that chequered flag, and at this juncture there really is no guarantees that it will be good in the end. My enthusiasm has certainly been significantly dowsed by playing the game in it's current state, and I have to say, I regret paying the money, but you never know, maybe i'll have gotten a good deal in the long run, only time will tell at this point. Only really worth investing if you really have an overwhelming desire to support the developer or have an incredibly optimistic disposition. Elsewise, wait and see.TL;DR --- One for management/stategy fans to stick on their wishlist and check in on every so often.			"

I've watched the robot hang up and not do his job.  Lists of things needing to be built are never built.  Random crashes.  I see a lot of updates about fixes for the game, but I can honestly tell hardly any difference in the game from a few months ago.  Honestly not worth the cash.  Good premise, but the game is unplayable, and I don't see it going anywhere in the future.  :\			"

								This game looked like an awesome idea, so I bought it even though it is still in development. This was a bad decision on my part, the game has been nearly impossible to play since I got it. Between the horrible character and robot code they all basically do nothing but get stuck in loops of doing one thing till they die. There is hardly any game play, other than a very basic ability to design a base layout. There are still a ton of bugs that crash the game. I just started a new game and it crashed within 2 min of starting. The developer is focused on visual and environtmental aspects of the game but fails to make any advancement of stabilizing the game to make it actually playable to any extent. The updates in the game are very slow coming.  I would give this game 0/5 because it is still not playable for any extended amount of time. Don't buy the game untill it has been heavily developed.

								I bought Maia long time ago (Dec '13), I thought it was a very promising game, the gameplay looked good, complexity check, love for base building games check. But as soon as I started, the UI was not there to help you, it was there to confuse you. I guess that the developers want the feel of a terminal. For example, when you are trying to build something, having to iterate over the options just in case there is something new is just wrong.After many many versions (more than 3 years). I tried the game again. Same horrible UX. Interfaces are meant to help the user, make it intuitive and a pleasure to play. Having to train my reflexes to browse the choice of items to build in a room till I find the one that I want is just bad.That is just an example. But there are others. All of them cry for the need of a UX specialist. Please, please please, hire someone that can understand usability.			"

								I purchased this game in December 2013. After a few sessions of play, I had seen that the game was in a very very very early alpha stage, had uninstalled it and forgot about it. With the 0.48 update, I came back to check what has improved. Well, after 1.5 years, this game is still looks like a  very early alpha and not even close to a beta status. It still has a lot of potential, but at the moment it only has that potential and nothing else. If you want to support it, buy it. Otherwise, you should wait a bit more. I do not recommend it in its current state.			"

								I like the general idea of the game and if it actually functioned the way it is intended to, I would enjoy it. However, after several tries on several development stages, so far it has disappointed me. Not being able to *directly* influence what game units do is only fun if game units do sensible things by themselves. Settlers not sleeping, because they have no beds is hilarious. Settlers not building beds (or anything for that matter) because they prefer to write hilarious letters is unsettling. Settlers not sleeping even though they have beds is frankly just annoying.I will happily play again and continue to give this game more chances since it is still in development.			"

								This is my first reveiw ever, and I only write this because I want to warn people.  First off, I have a Mac.  I know, hail PC master race, I'm not worthy and all that, yada yada...  If you have a PC, my complaints probably aren't for you.  For Mac users, here's your warning.The fact is, this game said it was Mac compatible, so I spent my 15 or 20 dollars thinking it would be, you know, Mac compatible.  Well, a year later, I still have never gotten to play the game (unless you count one time it actually started and ran at about .5 fps. for a few minutes before crashing.)  I have patiently waited for this dev team to fix whatever bugs have been preventing this game from running or even starting on my Mac that meets every system requirement I've seen.  And here I am still waiting, with no results to show for it.  Yes, this is an early access game, so bugs are expected.  But this has been an early access game for 3 years.  I think that is a long time for any game to be early access, and its plenty of time to fix bugs that make it impossible for customers to even start the game.  So please, save your money and move on.-100/10 "

								I bought Maia long time ago (Dec '13), I thought it was a very promising game, the gameplay looked good, complexity check, love for base building games check. But as soon as I started, the UI was not there to help you, it was there to confuse you. I guess that the developers want the feel of a terminal. For example, when you are trying to build something, having to iterate over the options just in case there is something new is just wrong.After many many versions (more than 3 years). I tried the game again. Same horrible UX. Interfaces are meant to help the user, make it intuitive and a pleasure to play. Having to train my reflexes to browse the choice of items to build in a room till I find the one that I want is just bad.That is just an example. But there are others. All of them cry for the need of a UX specialist. Please, please please, hire someone that can understand usability.			"

								i like this game, it is challenging and fun. the graphics are good but that is about the end of that. this game needs much work. the building is cumbersome and needs to be changed to a more tile style format. i for one do not like having to scroll the buildable items using ""q or e"" better user interactions are needed. also an ability to assign people to jobs or tasks is a must. another thing is and maybe its something im doing wrong, but people seem to die too easily. ill have plenty of power a hydrofarm, living area with all amenities yet they still die.

								As of recent patches the game no longer works on my machine. It did for a short while, but it seems to accuse me of graphics driver problems which I do not have. The point is that even though this is early access you are taking a risk with buying this game especially at this price. The developer should not be charging to this degree until he gets his♥♥♥♥♥♥sorted out. I don't normally give early access games the thumbs down, but it is deserved in this case.			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this game a while ago, like the market sale spiel, space versionof dungeon keeper, but with colonists, and a robot instead of imps. Oh and space chickens. Well I have played this twice and the game needs much more development. The tutorial is lax and needs more input, maybe hints of what to build first liek...oh I dont know and atmosphere generator (Will come back to this point). It took a few goes before I figured out that the robot is accessible, you dont click on it. you click on rock formations and he digs bits of the rock face out and you can then build your colony. No tutorial on how to use him though. Colonists are unuseable, they do what they want to do. I have played this a number of times and each time my colonists died of asphyxiation. Every time, even when I build atmosphere generators. This game is currently a no go without a decent tutorial. Its not a game per sae currently, its really a large project in futility and how to kill space colonists off the quickest.Thumbs down, I bought this knowing it was an early access game and they are stillworking on it, but this ... is embarrassing, It does not hold a candle to Dungeon Keeper. And yes my hours played looks low. Trust me if you have a Vista or earlier made computer this game will crash badly. My hours are lower than what it says above, its included crashes and time i tried tofigure out how to fix it. In my humble opinion, wait 6 months then have a look at reviews on here. See if some of the issues have been fixed but there are better things to waste money on than this. Free to plays are plentiful, this kind of half made game is far to commomn on Steam. They need to look at these and decide whats worth keeping on steam and what needs to be taken off and developed a bit more.Ok rant over 2/10			"

								The dev asks for people to submit saves when the game bugs out as the game usually bugs when playing for 4 hours.For me it bugs in 20 minutes or less.Colonists still cannot properly walk around the base without getting stuck. What has a higher priority than this bug? What about new features you cannot use? Bombs you do not need? Colonists crying over not enough lighting? Haikus!?I have the recommended system requirements and the main menu runs at 25fps at any resolution.The dev expressed having enough funds to continue this project for a long time. Yet I do not trust this product succesfully going out of early access like we imagined it.			"

								In its current build, the game is completely unplayable. Its list of faults is longer than a bad year, so I won't even try to name them all.That said, it shows a lot of promise. I am looking forward to the finished product, when it is released. Judging by the rate of improvement thus far, that should be in the summer of 2029, or thereabouts.I'd like to recommend it, but I can't. Currently it is simply not an enjoyable experience. In fact, one could argue it is not even a game yet, merely a concept demo. I can't say I regret paying for it, though, as I consider it money well spent in support of the game's development. I really do want this to be a good game. Or, failing that, at least a finished game.Update:Work continues. Although my colonists and the IMP remain utterly useless. The game is still completely unplayable, as the colonists will be happy to ignore everything you tell them to do, and thus promptly starve, thirst, or choke to death, as everything spontaneously bursts into flames around them for no damn reason.""It's only early access"" is not an excuse when not even the core mechanics are functioning, or even present. This game should not have been released as early as it was. It's still not ready for release.			"

Early Access Review
								So it seems like a cool game, it the screenshots seemed to be how I would picture an ideal game of this type. I've been following Maia for a while but I've never bought an early release game and was hesitant to do so. I few weeks, maybe a month ago I bought Prison Architect, which is also an early release game and it was great, it seems complete even though they are still working on it. Then just a few days I decided to buy Maia, I believed for the price it would be fun to play and see how it would grow through updates. However I can't play. I installed in on my computer and when I start it up I get a little document which flashes and then shut downs, not even making it to the actual game. I reinstalled it, didnt work.  Changed around with the screen scenes and it didnt do anything. So I tried to install it on my cousins computer. I got so excited when the game launched, I got to what I guess was the loading screen before it faded white and said, ""Maia.exe has stopped working.""I dont believe both computers have issues, I would like to think it was simply an early release bug, but they are two different problems. So for now, I would not recommend this game until this is fixed. I do hope this can be fixed with a future update as I really would like to try out this game.			"

								READ BEFORE YOU THINK THIS IS A PURELY POSITIVE REVIEW!!I normally don't like to review games this early on because I really don't think it's fair to either the consumer or the devs to do so at this stage.  However I think a good number of the of the reviews have been a bit unfair.  A lot of the reviews aren't taking into account how early this game really is in development.  Yes that is the fault of the devs for jumping the gun, and putting it on the market, however the game does show a lot of progress, and it's a really good concept.  It is extremly buggy at the moment but that's to be expected of any early access game.  That's why I'm not considering the bugs in this review but I'm focusing on the content.  The devs have done a good job of keeping this game as a more realistic survival/ managment game, and that's nice to see, since it's not really something that has been done that much.  HOWEVER! I don't write reveiws for the sake of the devs, but for the sake of the customer.  This game is a big risk!  It's very hard to tell how this game is going to turn out at this stage since it's in such a raw state.  I myself think that it's going to turn out well, and that's why I'm giving a positve review.  However unless you're a risk taker I would advise that you hold off for a little while before you buy this game, and keep an eye on it from afar.			"

								I feel like this has been a misuse of the early access feature of Steam. The game shows promise, but it is simply not fit for sale, and the infrequency of updates does not give me hope that it ever will be.Neat concept with sharp humour, but should still be on the drawing board.			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this game knowing it is in development. What I read about it appealed to me - especially simulation parts and hard sci-fi approach.First, good stuff - game is not finished, but it is playable and you can certainly mock around interesting parts of running explorer's base. Atmosphere is gloomy but not overbearing, As sound production geek I love work done on sound. Loving sim parts of the game, also that author explains work behind features. While I have issues with interface - down with bad stuff - they are certainly mendable. I can recommend game for sci-fi fans easily, especially if you pick it up during sale. Worthy to follow development.Bad stuff - I have performance issues with my Linux port, it feels clunky and FPS drops a lot. Still, it's Early Access, so I don't mind much about it. Now, interface can become seriously cluttered if there's too much stuff going on. Tutorial level needs more pauses and more explanation, I got my two explorers kiled with ease.In overall, very nice foundation to continue to improve. Will give tutorial another try to keep all them alive.			"

								I have tried and tried to like this game.  It shows tons of potential but so far, I haven't seen much development.  There are many bugs that still need to be fixed and the game released over a year ago.  The AI is dumb, the mechanics aren't there, and the overall experience feels more like a chore.  Every new ""update"" is new content it seems, with few bug fixes.  I understand early access but this game might as well still be pre-alpha.  It should be in closed bug testing still.  I had hopes this game would live up to its potential, maybe it's still too soon to tell but as of right now, it's falling short.			"

								I do recomend this game, but wait for it to fix some of the exsisting bugs that makes the game unplayable. It needs to fix the preformance, AI, notification system, and other minor bugs/issues. I have an ASUS 760 graphics card that can play Assassin's Creed Black Flag at max settings with no problems, but this game makes me lag badly whenever something big happens! The AI will biuld a workbench, but nothing else which will cause them do eventualy die! Also, whenever a notification pops up, it stops the game instantly and makes you read it. I hope that they make an actual menu for biulding structures and objects instead of pressing the 1-9 keys and V & B keys! Also, they need to make it so that you don't need to completly dependent on a robot to dig out areas. This game does have a lot of problems now, but the bugs should be fixed in a few patches.			"

Early Access Review
Disclaimers I backed this game on Kickstarter I haven’t played a huge amount (mainly due to ancient GPU issues), but watched many hours of Maia Twitch dev streams I’m currently a patron of the developer (Simon Roth) at https://www.patreon.com/simorothDo you like science-fiction?Do you like classic god/sim games?Are you looking for something unique, different & challenging?If so, read on...My Introduction to MaiaI first became aware of Maia back in 2012 when Kickstarter was in full swing. The unusual sci-fi aesthetics and interesting vision are what initially attracted me, and I continue to be impressed by how driven the developer is.This is a god game with subtle challenges underneath. Challenges which may even change the way you view game design in general afterwards.Maia, the HUD & GameplayWhy even mention the HUD? Well, rather than take the approach of giving the player an easy categorised spreadsheet list of all the various variables/states in the game via large sprawling HUD panels, Maia chooses to integrate much of that as items/signals visually within the world itself. It is this world which you'll spend most of your time interacting with as you expand your base, build machinery, craft autonomous robots, and battle the various hardships that colonising a harsh alien landscape requires.This difference in game design approach isn’t for everyone, and can force the more casual gamer to rage, but therein lies the treat for those who persevere. Creating a large self-sustaining tech-enabled nuclear fusion powered colony from a few desperate souls is really satisfying, and you’ll end up more attached to it than just about any other god/sim game out there.Sure, it does take some time to understand how the world works, and there are some quirks which may be bugs (it is in Early Access currently), but it makes for such a refreshing change from the sea of clone and asset store created games currently on sale.Sound & Model DesignAs a fan of both the 80’s culture and electronic music in general, the general model design and music/effects are really top notch for a small studio, and thus deserve a special mention. I had flashbacks of Vangelis’ Blade Runner combined with Space 1999 and it’s a perfect fit for this type of game in my opinion.If we’re lucky, we’ll see a Maia soundtrack release at some point.Bugs & Developer CommitmentFor a game initially Kickstarted in 2012/2013, you’d be quite right to question when the release would be, especially as we’re now approaching 2017.Thankfully, unlike many other games that become abandonware, the Maia build is still being actively updated with fixes and new content.To give an example, I've recently seen the developer having to put in extraordinary work to fix problems for Linux users which were not caused by the game, but GPU drivers. I also heard they spent a huge amount of time trying to make the game run on older Intel drivers. These particular issues are also somewhat to blame for the slip in release dates.That's commitment you don't see from AAA devs, let alone an indie dev.You can clearly tell that this is a passion project, which more than likely means that development will continue for some considerable time irrespective of version numbering. Not only that, but the developer is extremely technically skilled, having written the actual game engine itself that drives Maia.If I had any critisim of the developer, it would be the heavy reliance on Steam Early Access, but then this is more a business issue rather than anything else, and hopefully the future will be a bit brighter after the recent Steam changes and tweaked business models from lessons learned.More Than Just MaiaIf you're anything like me, and have an interest in what's under-the-hood, you may be surprised to hear that the developer seems very keen to engage in that kind of discussion.I've watched a dev twitch stream where a crash occurred. The dev then took viewers through code explaining a sizable amount, making a change, recompiling the game source, and playing the new revision. I don't think I've ever seen that kind of open engagement from a developer before.See for yourself: https://www.twitch.tv/simorothOn top of that, they’ve also provided a publicly accessible site showing the code changes committed to the project:https://dev.maiagame.com/Again, which other developer does this?!To SummariseIf you want a new experience and appreciate the different approach Maia takes, then you will, I’m sure, see the beauty behind this one-of-a-kind labour of love.Edit (Feb 2017): The most recent version of the game, 0.60 has lava (seen in original kickstarter art), and many, many fixes. In fact, the game has been fixed/tweaked in a huge number of places over subsequent updates such that it's hard to find any glaring issues. Very happy to see this and very impressed at the continued commitment.			"

								This game should, someday, be great. Currently, the AI is so buggy it is hard to actually play, with colonists dying from starvation because they've managed to build a hydroponic carrot that somehow blocks the way out of the room, or a room with no doors, or simply standing in the airlock until they run out of air - I've had all of these happen. That said, updates happen, content is added, and the game is in such better shape now than a year ago that I feel comfortable giving a thumbs-up.			"

								Well here it is years later and the game is still in alpha and unfinished. In my opinion the game is gone down hill. Buggy, crashes a lot, I had high hopes for this game. Early access should not mean forever in early access..OLD review below:Maia is still being developed so there is not much of a game there as yet. Early days for Maia. At this stage Maia cannot be really played, just looked at and wait for it to be created and updated. If you expect to download a 98% finnished game you maybe very upset. The game is at in my opinion at about 30% complete. There is not even a save game feature as yet. If you buy now you will be waiting to a possible mid next year to really say I can play this game now. I got in early because as the game is updated I can share my opinions on the update for better or worse. This way I can see the game being created and in a small way help it become better by giving feedback to the games creator on what has worked and what has not.    :)			"

								As much as I like this premise and hoped for improvement I cannot recommend this game even after the latest patches. The colonist AI is so bad they will allow themselves to die rather than taking care of themselves. With something so basic being broken is bad enough, but with the dev promoting working around the bad AI rather than actually acknowledging and working on the problem looks bad the the game at any stage.UPDATE: As of the release of version .60 the colonists are no longer out to kill themselves and actually take care of their basic needs for survival as long as what they need is available. With this, the game can actually be played and progress made in creating a base. While there are still signifigant problems, this marks a huge improvement and is actually in a playable condition and can recommend this game.			"

								Take it off the monetization. The game is not near ready to play for money. Make it free for few months and remove the errors, glitches and other stuff that needs to be fixed. Instructions on how to play are not clear, it is anoying, and slower than reading from a piece of paper, it has to be interactive, or atleast have photos of the things you need to use. There is no save option, none that I found atleast in this version. So whatever I make is for nothing, just a waste of time.Nevertheless the concept is awesome, and that is why I bought the game, but with an unfinished game like this for over 20 euros is just too much.

								I didn't manage to get much time on this game due to study taking priority, but from the miniscle amount of time I did get I can say this; it's fun!The game is a simulation of sorts of trying to colonise an inhospitable planet. There are many dangers present, such as colonist incompetence, your own incompetence (yep! My first play and everyone died of hypothermia), planetary dangers (earthquakes), equipment failures, solar flares/radiation. A bit like a Sim-something game, scaled down and focused on the premise of colonising - well okay, similar in scope to ""The Sims"", but Mars! Colonists all have their own personalities and skillsets, and as such are more/less suited for particular tasks. Getting a random song or poem from one is a charming touch.It is a very interesting game, and one that is gaining more depth and complexity as time goes on. It may be early-access alpha level, but the game already has more than enough in it to entertain for hours; I can see myself getting lost in it easily.The developer is incredibly active, both on social media, as well as posting a game changelog on their website and in the games news section on Steam. Seriously, check out the news section! They are very passionate about their game, and this shows heavily in playing it.If you like the idea or premise behind ""The Sims"" but didn't like the mundane setting of it, maybe this will tickle your fancy?Oh and did I mention it has humour?

								It will be GREAT game when it's finished, but now it's unplayableEDIT 23.01.2017: Developer is crying little b*tch who is doing nothingEDIT 14.02.2015: I feel like I have to edit this review. What to say... This game is still in early alpha but developers are really trying to improve this game. They added lot of new features (bugs as well) improved engine and their communication with fans is good (or above average).And now something negative. There is lot work to do. My opinion is that this game is still unplayable as it was (yes it is better but no too much). It has opportunity to be very good base-building game, but you have to wait for it.I will not change my recommendation right now, but I believe this game and I hope I will not be disappointed			"

The AI isn't too bright; The colonists will try to build and maintain things, but they generally don't seem to have any idea what's going on, and seem content to run back and forth for no reason. The concept is promising, however, and I hope to see it as a finished product one day.			"

								  Having played this Early Access intermittently over the last few months, it's not looking good.  Although the core concept and some of the primitive mechanics look interesting, the gameplay entirely relies 'Sims-style' on your queuing tasks that your little minions then carry out - with a completely non-functional AI the game is basically unplayable (we're talking humans randomly running out of airlocks and quickly dying, service robots that frequently drop jobs or get stuck in odd places, and every individual item having to be workshopped and deployed by your little accident-prone colonists). Combine this with spontaneous earthquake-style events damaging critical machinery like airlocks and life support, some of which are unfixable, and you've got yourself a dealbreaker.  Did I mention the appalling framerate and frequent CTDs? I'm running a pretty competitive desktop rig, and being told to ""check my drivers"" in bugthreads over and over again is just getting silly.  Most of the releases over the past year (we're STILL in alpha remember) seem to have been cosmetic alterations rather than serious attempts to repair the underlying gameplay problems, there have been no updates in over two months, and the Dev appears to have over-reached their funding pool in Steam.

								Despite being advertised as a Mac OS platform game, I have never been able to successfully launch this game. I understand it is a game in Alpha and there will be bugs. But a bug that keeps the game for even launching is inexcusable. I've had the game a while, I've waited the bug to be addressed by two patches and still it does not work. There's been little to no support or communication regarding this bug. I'm not the only one who has this bug.I feel like this game should not be offered as a Mac OS platform game. Not until it truly works all the time on Mac. It's not fair for people to pay for a game that doesn't work and have the issue virtually ignored by the developer.			"

								This is not a game. At least not the kind of game you want to pay for.It's more like Technical Alpha version.It is impossible to do absolutely nothing.If you think you can play even in the most primitive sandbox - you are mistaken. All you can do - look at the little room and the landscape. No presence in the game - from the simple observation.How Steam missed it, but still allowed to take money for it - remains a mystery.Это не игра. По крайней мере не та игра, за которую следует платить.Это больше походит на Техническую Альфа версию.В ней нельзя делать абсолютно НИЧЕГО.Если вы думаете, что сможете поиграть хотя бы в самую примитивную песочницу - вы заблуждаетесь. Всё, что Вы сможете сделать - посмотреть на комнатки и ладшафт. Никакого присутствия в игре - простое наблюдение со стороны.Как стим пропустил это, да еще и разрешил брать за это деньги - остается загадкой.			"

								This has been an early access game for a LONG time now, with updates somewhat few and far away from each other.  I had REALLY high hopes for this game, but, as is, it doesn't meet my expectations-which are pretty low to begin with.  As is, this game is impossible to play and by play, I mean maintain a colony for more than half an hour.  I'm only giving it a good review because I think that they will make it better over time and I'm being optimistic when I say that.  A lot of the ""updates"" do very little to improve the playability of the game, they're more like bug fixes instead of improvements to the game.  If you are thinking of getting it, I would wait untill it's out of early access or if it goes on sale for REALLY cheap. It has the potential to be a GREAT game, I'm still waiting for that though....Hopefully, it will be sooner, rather than later...			"

Early Access Review
								Maia is basically one of many atempts to juice up an old concept. Throughout teh years many games about colony survival hit the games market and only a couple gained a place in our memories. e.g. Outpost, Space Colony, Startopia. But, most of those games are lost in the vast endless space of cybernet.So, how able is Maia in obtaining a place amongst our memory?At this point, it's a buy and forget game. Not because of the way it looks, it's probably one the best looking colony survival games out there, but because of the way it tries to create an atmosphere. I don't know exactly why, but something is missing.. The feeling of survival. Why should I build s**t if I don't care. Why should I research things if I don't see the point in doing so.This is probably because of the lack of any solid plot and future goal that keeps me interested.Yea, sure, my goal is to survive. Yea, whatever, I'm playing a game, I want some glittering prices along the way and some motivation to do some crazy things. I'm playing a game to escape the dull side of reality, so please, don't show me my daily struggle. In other words, we need a good Visual Novel style content / plot / story. We need interesting characters and social dillema's.If Maia is able to provide us with those things in the near future, well, in that case we might have ourselves a winner.But, as long as it stays the way it is (Bugs not taken into account) it's a dull experience.My final verdict, which might sound strange, is ""Yes""not bad, actually pretty good, because it shows good potential.On the other hand, I won't hesitate to put out a huge ""NO"" if the developers don't change the ""Living"" part of the game. The social interaction, story and story driven motivation.			"

								The idea of this game is good, innovative and has a great deal of potential....But it is only that... Potential.  At the moment this isn't a game, rather a 5% finished application that rewards your exploration of new things with crashes.  Basic features, such as a save game, or even a proper explanation of what you should be doing are absent.  It is wrong for STEAM to already allow this game under an early-access program.  It will take months, if not a year before anything stable comes out of this, and that is assuming the developer(s?) will continue work on this.I don't recommend to buy this game, not until it is at least a few months from now.

								This is another example of a "" half-baked to make a buck "" game. This is why indie game's don't sell. I want my money back.This game stinks. I'm sorry I voted for it in greenlight. I'm very sorry I wasted $24 on it. I'm even more sorry the publisher recieved any of my money. Crime shouldn't pay.It doesn't work with Window's 8.I had to put the Maia.exe into XP sp3 compatibility mode to get it to launch. Still it only would launch 1/3 of the time. It goes looking for driver's that should be provided, if needed. Once inside the game, the controls are terrible. Most of the time they don't respond. I couldn't get it to demolish doorways to expand rooms properly. The game kept wanting to place things instead.There is no sidebar to select the items you want to place, like in any other building game. There is no demolish button. You have to go into the main game file and open a readme text file to find out what the controls are. There should be a sidebar icon for each of the controls, like any other building game. In game messages are very difficult to even read because they are distorted by a pointless green line distortion effect... Forget anything like a voice tutorial... The 2 main challenge's in a game shouldn't be getting it to launch or getting the control's to work.  I don't care if game publisher claim's this game is in perpetual Alpha. I expect $24 worth of game for $24. The can be no excuse for the shabby state of this game. This looks like a project someone got lazy and gave up on.			"

								I would recommend this game because the play through videos on youtube look great, However i dont get to play. Despite have a system above the minimum requirements, the game refuses to work.Now let me explain my issue. The game itself starts up just fine. I even get to the start up screen, however there is no mouse to be found. I can guess where the mouse is and get the game to launch, however the mouse still refuses to show. i have scowered the guides for similar issues without luck. I even sent an email to the dev and after about 15 emails back and forth, the devs replied with ""The latest build has some more code that might fix your problem or at least give us a clue about the issue."" and thats the last i have heard about it. even after trying to reply to that email. so in my book its wasted money.

								I've watched this game evolve from the earliest days, when the build wasn't even available on Steam (hence the playtime). Like all Early Access games, it's often hard to recommend to other people because of both the changing nature of the game, and the fact that people see them as incomplete.But this one is worth your money. Space? Check. Hazardous materials? Check. Scientists? Check. Headcrabs? What do you think this is, Half-Life? Of course not.It does have all sorts of otherworldly creatures for you to watch over and befriend harvest for their rich nutrients to improve the lives of your terribly-downtrodden colonists though.Very neat space colony simulator, with very frequent updates.

								This is absolute crap.  It's completely unplayable.  Steam didn't make it clear that ""early access"" meant ""pre-alpha"" and ""unplayable"".  Still, even the bits that do work are horribly done.  While loading a DOS window pops up... seriously?  It's 2013 dude. ""poor"" connect to central command in game play is cover story for ""crap graphics and poor audio""All most allinteraction is done via 1990's style keyboard commands. The game looks NOTHING like the screenshots and screen navigation is impossible.   $18 shot to hell. The steam No-Refunds policy sucks.			"

Early Access Review
								So you're colonists can die within the first couple of minutes of the game and you don't even know why... The dev (only 1 I believe) creating this is an idiot. I listened to a podcast he did and while I agree, I don't want to be spoonfed every detail... you could at least give me a chance to figure out what's going on... The tutorial doesn't cover anything, just makes sarcastic remarks and shows basic keystrokes but doesn't explain what anything actually does. There is no pause button, meaning you can't hit pause and look at your base to find out what to do next. Especially important at the beginning of the game. So as of right now, the game is about starting a new game, failing within minutes, and restarting a new game. While I like the concept of starting over with more info to do a better job the second time I hardly even have time to find out what my mistakes were. Edit: The dev is a Genius/Idiot, and I am empathetic as I am similar. He has built something so complex with actual science behind each piece. An intimate knowledge of electricity is something i've seen so far. So the idiot part, the implementation, the part where you connect with real people. As I've said there is so much lacking here. For one a pause button, but after writing this I realized there is no save. Supposedly there is a quicksave and quickload but it doesn't work. So EVERY time you load the game you're looking at starting a new game. So back to the genius/idiot point. He's done so well in the implementation of certain points of the game, however other parts make it almost broken. I will continue to update this review untill it is comprehensive on the good/bad points of the game... (Written below, in under FINAL EDIT: I have stopped rewievewing this after I receieved a refund. I can't very well continue a review if I'm not able to test certain aspects of the game. The review will stay 'as is' and incomplete. Poetic? I think so, this game has been in early access for a long time now. As my last entry edit, which I wasn't going to mention, the dev admits to spending around a year working to make the game compatible with old graphics cards. This is why I can't find myself to remove the genius/idiot part of the review. You could possibly replace the 'idiot' comment with inexperience, however in the same podcast he mentions the old graphics cards he touts all the projects he's worked on. Being fully aware of what you are buying into with Early Access, I don't forsee my troubles being fixed anytime soon if ever. So there you have it, an incomplete review of an incomplete game. (See dice roll below))Plusses:+++ A genuine real life face for every colonist++ The plants have energy value in joules (Thank you Mr. Newton)Minuses:--- Everyone died in the ""TUTORIAL""...--- One mission ""Cassiopeia"" says you have 45 minutes until more colonists arrive, it's more like 3-5 minutesExplanation: Ok so on top of everything else the AI is messed up beyond reproach, the I.M.P. robots will rush to make a door when things like an 'atmosphere creator' is in need of building, or a space heater has been qued when everyone is freezing. They seem to make wind generators at a fair pace but still neglect other objects needed that an alarm is buzzing at you about. It comes down to timing. The 'game' doesn't give you enough time to correct any potential problems before colonists die from them. Say hypothermia. I put up the space heaters but no one is building them. If a colonist is dying of freezing you would think that would be a priority. The theme is based around not being spoon-fed answers by your user-interface. You get emails from the colonists asking what they want. The problem is by the time you read them they are dead from whatever it was they wrote about. I have no idea what the dev is thinking...Sorry, I wanted to like this but I wouldn't suggest buying even at half price...Final Edit: I ultimately asked for and receieved a refund for Maia, I'm leaving the review as it was at the time of refund. The only things I will add are that I was fully aware of the F5 and F9 save/load, they did not work. I was not aware of the space button to pause, though I don't think it would have helped. Perhaps my machine is running the game too fast for some reason because when I see videos the colonists and imps are moving about half the speed they moved when I played. Events and emails happened so fast I couldn't read them fast enough and often the event (say a meteor-strike or death by hypothermia) happened as I was reading the in game emails. I'd also like to say I don't think this is a cash grab like some other early acess title's. The dev seems very passionate about it and is hands on updating often. Since I receieved a refund this review will remain incomplete and unchanged from here on. Good luck to dev(s) and  good luck on the dice roll anyone takes when they buy it.			"

								I have tried to like this game.  I really have.  But it is one of my biggest early access regrets.The AI is simply awful.  The settlers are complete idiots, and will not do simple things like build food planters to help themselves survive.  Instead they will wander in circles and grab their stomachs, wondering why they are so hungry.  They won't build beds, but then they'll wander around random rooms until they die of exhaustion.  It's stupid.  The chickens are more intelligent than the settlers ffs.  The devs either need to vastly improve the AI, or add in a way to control or at least prod settlers to do what they need to be doing.  I understand the whole ""early access"" concept, but this is like one of the basic premises of the game.  If the settlers can't even stay alive on their own for an hour, why the **** am I playing?I wrote a review of this a long time back, when it was more or less a demo at full price.  I didn't recommend it back then, but someone on the dev team commented asking me to try the game again and do another review.  Well, here you go random guy.  The game is still bad, I still don't recommend it, and thank goodness for games like The Forest, Subnautica, and Project Zomboid, or I'd have completely lost faith in the EA concept.			"

								Additional update edits are inside ++++++++++++After purchasing a new monitor and attempting to play this game not only did i realise it doesnt support widescreen but that the features being added to this game seem totally pointless. I feel like I am playing a game from the early 2000 with features still in development. Seriously... its been so long now, HOW CAN CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS STILL BE A PART OF TESTING. Bugs are everywhere (including just trying to change graphical settings) and the gameplay is outdated to say the least. If steam had the refund option when i purchased this. I would have refunded it on the spot+++++++++++++++++++++So a new patch has come out which for me, has been the biggest improvement since the beginning. I have actually managed to build a base! WOOHOO!! :D There is a bug that still occurs where the human AI get stuck and end up dying from starvation but I hope that this will be fixed soon!++++++++++This game COULD be great. But what lets it down most of all is the AI (A CORE MECHANIC OF THE GAME). For a game that has been in Alpha for almost a year now the AI is STILL SHOCKING to the point where the game is virtually still unplayable. People and the IMP get ""stuck"" and dont move leaving you to restard or watch them die.The people don't build certain things even when they should be able to (For example I have NEVER been able to build a hopper, it just sits there unbuilt for countless amounts of time)I've had people die from exhaustion because they refuse to build a bed.....I have only played 4.4hrs of the game and watched tutorials on how to get people to do things but nothing ever works. this game needs a serious overhal becuase as it stands, I WARN YOU NOT TO BUY IT			"

								Update: Sept 2016The developer has read and responded to most if not all reviews.  He is dedicated to fixing any and all issues and making this game the best it can be.  At this point I am editing my review in the hopes that this encourages others to do the same.The game may not be the most in depth and engaging game out there but he is trying and it is obvious that he cares about more than sales.  Give it a chance, find something you like, be supportive and provide feedback outside of a♥♥♥♥♥♥review.			"

								This game is much better than it used to be, it does have problems with AI and crashing but is guarenteed to take up all of your free time.			"

								Additional update edits are inside ++++++++++++After purchasing a new monitor and attempting to play this game not only did i realise it doesnt support widescreen but that the features being added to this game seem totally pointless. I feel like I am playing a game from the early 2000 with features still in development. Seriously... its been so long now, HOW CAN CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS STILL BE A PART OF TESTING. Bugs are everywhere (including just trying to change graphical settings) and the gameplay is outdated to say the least. If steam had the refund option when i purchased this. I would have refunded it on the spot+++++++++++++++++++++So a new patch has come out which for me, has been the biggest improvement since the beginning. I have actually managed to build a base! WOOHOO!! :D There is a bug that still occurs where the human AI get stuck and end up dying from starvation but I hope that this will be fixed soon!++++++++++This game COULD be great. But what lets it down most of all is the AI (A CORE MECHANIC OF THE GAME). For a game that has been in Alpha for almost a year now the AI is STILL SHOCKING to the point where the game is virtually still unplayable. People and the IMP get ""stuck"" and dont move leaving you to restard or watch them die.The people don't build certain things even when they should be able to (For example I have NEVER been able to build a hopper, it just sits there unbuilt for countless amounts of time)I've had people die from exhaustion because they refuse to build a bed.....I have only played 4.4hrs of the game and watched tutorials on how to get people to do things but nothing ever works. this game needs a serious overhal becuase as it stands, I WARN YOU NOT TO BUY IT			"

Early Access Review
								Update:With 0.59  Maia has had a lot of content , fixs and tweaks - really making it feel more and more like a decent budget AAA game rather then a indie. I mean, its not there yet, but Maia's pretty darn ambisious, so its amazing how far its come.I think the key to if you will enjoy Maia or not is if your prepared to learn and replay a lot. While initially it feels like ""scifi dungeon keeper"", the game is a lot less forgiving. You have to balance life essentials like heat,power,atmosphere before you even get to food and drink. Each time you play - and your colonists all die horribly - you tend to learn a bit more for next time.The game also, despite being early access, has a lot of content already, with various scenarios as well as free exploration. So with these too things in mind, its certainly not a game to be used up quickly.The downloads/limitations of the current 0.59 state of the game are mostly UI related, as well as some AI issues with colonists build priority's. Its perfectly possible for them to build themselves into a room with no doors - so you better hope another colonist will decide to build a door before they die or starvation/dehydration.Despite this, its a game I definitely recommend for sci-fi fans with patience, and a desire for a reasonably realistic ""let me set up a base on a unexplored alien world"" game.-----------Previous review (Sept 13):Maia is already a great expirence, with even more great potential.It feels sort of like dungeon keeper meets star-trek with bits of dwarf fortress chucked in too. Its ambitions are big, but its pulling them all of pretty good so far. Anyone that yearns to build bases on alien worlds really should check this game out.Additionally;Please don't dismiss this game from the (very recent) negative score. A lot of the negative reviews are over a year old.Anyone that gave it a go earlier, Id recomend trying a more recent version too, its been refined A LOT over the last few months.			"

								My old review:""I can't put into words how dissapointed I am with the dev. Don't get me wrong, I love the concept. But.He adds in all these new ""features"" without even fixing the current game as it is.I find this game to be an insult to the gaming world as a whole.""My new review:It is beginning to feel much more fun, now i can sustain a base for a while with people (usually) doing what I expect them to. But don't take that to mean it is complete, it still has a way to go.			"

								Amended Review - As of Maia 0.58. (Original Review 12/2013)Still an early Access game at this point.MAIA is rough. Still ""Alpha"" rough. There's great potential here, but I'm rather hesitant to recommend a game this unpolished and unfinished to anyone. For now, I'd advise waiting, and returning when the team delivers that final software.However...If you're willing to tolerate the slow pace of development necessitated by the small team, then I do really think that there's a gem on the way here. It's still early days, but the game has come a long way since I first played it in 2013, and the development team has continued to roll out updates, including feature additions and bugfixes indicative of ongoing long-term development and support.As long as you understand that you're getting in on an alpha, this might be worth a look. Just recognize that it's not a finished product yet, and given the pace of development will not be ready for that final rollout for some time.			"
