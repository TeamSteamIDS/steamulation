												After playing through the full (post early access) release, the verdict is in and I can confidently say that Skulls of the Shogun is a winner. This quirky turn-based strategy game seems simple at first, but there are actually some surprisingly deep levels of nuance and complexity beneath the surface. You play as a Japanese swordsman General who is trying to reclaim his stolen identity in the afterlife. The art style is very unique and really well done. The cast of characters and story are also very cool. The dialogue, in particular, is a highlight. I wasn't expecting much from that aspect of a seemingly simple strategy game, but I was pleasantly surprised at how funny and entertaining it was.So the aesthetic portions of the game are definitely good, but what of the actual gameplay, you ask? In short, it's pretty damn good. Gameplay is turn based, but on each turn you have 5 ""orders"" that can be performed. Your team is comprised of various types of units (warriors, cavalry, archers), each of which has their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of moving on tiles like other strategy games, the actions in this game are more free-roaming. Units are able to move anywhere they want, within a certain radius, and are also able to continue moving after performing an action, which adds to the level of strategy involved. One of your main goals is to eat the skulls of defeated opponents, which restores health. However, if a unit is able to eat 3 skulls, they transform into a Demon, which enables them to perform 2 actions per turn, which is a huge advantage. Gameplay becomes a delicate balancing act of attacking, positioning and staying alive long enough to power up. Outside of these main elements, there are a number of other nuances (summoning monks with special powers, forming spirit walls, environmental hazards, deciding when to bring your general into battle, and more) that add many layers of complexity to the basic strategy. Every level seems to provide some new elements to learn or deal with, and this keeps the main campaign fresh from start to finish. There's no padding at all. The main campaign lasts several hours (more if you play on a higher difficulty or attempt to complete the set of special goals for each level) and is worth the price of admission alone. In addition, the game also features online, local and asynchronous multiplayer matches. So there is plenty of content here for both casual and competitive types. All in all, this game is solid and brings some really cool twists to the turn-based strategy genre. If you are into that type of thing, pick this one up. And if not, well, this could be the game that makes you a fan. Check it out.			"

												Skulls of the Shogun is another indie turn based tactics game. This is a fun game to play because the levels are short and packed with action and tough decision making. It’s also easy to learn and play because there is no hex counting, no charts, and no tables. It has special objectives for completionists including a time attack trial and a developer commentary for all 20 levels. I like this game because individual levels are short. The long levels can be 30 minutes but you can easily finish most within 15. Skulls doesn’t waste time with load outs or gear management. The only thing you need to manage is your troops and your rice (a currency to buy units). You manage your units with five orders each turn. Activating a unit takes an order. Most decisions are simple yet tough. Do you deal damage? Do you take crucial economy or troop producing buildings? Do you eat skulls to upgrade your troops? Do you provide other units protection from knock back?Many turn based tactics games rely on special attack and armor types. In Skulls you won’t need to memorize the latest version of rock-paper-scissors. Attacks are easy to understand. Units deal damage and armor subtracts it. No long time investments studying maximum efficiency. Though it is a tactics game and so if hyper efficient decision making is what you like then you’ll be glad to know that each level is scored, even including leaderboards. Each level also has alternate secondary objectives such as winning without losing any units. On the negative side I think knock back while intuitive often felt a bit fuzzy. An attack that I thought for sure would knock an opponent over an edge just barely hangs on and vice versa. Also while it’s fun that individual levels are short it would have been nice to have more than 20 levels to play through. Because it’s possible to play through the game in less than ten hours that means Skulls relies a lot on it’s great replayability.Due to it's campaign length I think the $14.99 asking price might be a bit much but this is definitely a great purchase at $10.

												Skulls of Shogun is a surprisingly great game of 2013 for me. With the rise in popularity of Turn Based Strategy (TBS) games, It can be difficult for Skulls of Shogun to stood out among the other quality TBS games such as XCOM, Civilization V, and so on.Still, with its quirky art style and fairly witty humor that is set in Samurai's afterlife, Skulls of Shogun features a well designed and carefully balanced mechanics, I find Skulls of Shogun to be very enjoyable game to play. At the same time, the game tries to introduce a gridless movement system where your unit's movement range is denoted by a white circle with a fixed radius, I find this innovation to a decent change that works well to be an alternative to the typical grid system found in a lot of TBS games. Combining with the cross platform compatibility with iOS, one could even play this game on the go. While Skulls of Shogun looks like a mobile port, it felt more like a PC game with reasonable amount of depth despite having a rather small unit roster. Each unit has its own unique role that can be useful in the right hands. Personally, I find the PC version's UI to be pretty decent and mouse friendly while it is equally playable on a touch screen.If you like Turn Based Strategy, give Skulls of Shogun a go if you have the chance. You could find yourself putting a couple of hours into this indie gem.			"

												Skulls of the Shogun is a turn based strategy game with a surprising amount of tactical depth. Units are varied - samurai, cavalry, archers and four types of magic using monks - all with different strengths and weaknesses. Positioning of units is important, because they can counter attack in certain situations, and can also be knocked off ledges for an instant kill. Eating the skulls of dead enemies regains health and increases max health, while controlling rice gardens and shrines lets you summon extra units. The game is challenging, because on most levels you are outnumbered and surrounded, but at the same time well balanced, because each side can only move 5 units per turn. However, any unit that eats three skulls unlocks an extra attack per turn. The game has a wacky sense of humour, particularly with its amusing text only dialogue and animation style. The singleplayer campaign is quite long and very stable. Definitely worth checking out.			"

												Unfortunately, little do the bulk of TBS addicts know about this rare gem bringing a nice change of pace. Many consider it as a spiritual successor of Advance Wars, and it is in many ways yet by being a  truly unique experience in the even rarer ''cartoony TBS'' sub genre. Don't get it wrong: despite its ( marvelous ) cartoony construct  & hilarious dialogues ( really ), Skulls of the Shogun also shines via a lenghty campaign of well drawn maps. Overall strategy and multiple tactics may seem basic, but ways to win versus enemies ( AI or multiplayer ) require the full attention of veteran players as well. It's not perfect on crowded bottlenecks when trying to command orders, some little glitch here and there, though nothing to alter an otherwise joyful turn based combat.Pros: vivid cartoony construct and turn based combat mixed pretty well; lenghty campaign and multiplayer modes; hilarious dialogues; great audio track.Cons: ordering units when crowded like sardines; some questionable unit range versus obstacle placement.Bottom line: Highly recommended.

												Simple and fun strategy game. The humor can be a little hit and miss, but all in all I had a really good time while playing it. It outstays it's welcome just a tiny, little bit towards the end, because the strategy elements are really simple and gets somewhat repetitive because of that, but the game is saved by its best humor bits and the relatively short time you have to set aside to beat it. Definitely worth the asking price. Recommended.			"

												well this turn based strategy game is very addicting. I've only played the single player/campaign mode and I couldn't find multiplayer match :( . I guess the multiplayer has been ""long gone"" or maybe I just couldn't find any player online. In this game you are playing as a afterlife general in shogun era (I always think general = shogun himself), nah don't think to much.you are able to control several units and it does have the feel of advanced wars on DS without grid. the concept are same, there are resources/paddy field to conquer, statue/jizo that act as unit spawn place or towers that will do 1 damage in the beginning of each player turn. the AI unit and level design is smart, the game doesn't feel too hard or too easy, but the challenge is hard and sometimes you have to repeat few times to get all skulls (like stars from mobile games) the music, gameplay and graphics of this game are well done made. the control however does have a bit of problem. I use logitech wireless x-input, I think this game was planned to be steam and mobile game, and to pick a unit from a controller you have to use dpad , sometimes a unit won't be selected -- this is just minor issue and maybe the problem didn't exist if you use mouse as you can select by clicking the unit. I just like to use controller if possible.I saw the credits and I didn't find japanese name on it.. or maybe I just missed it, I thought the developers are from Japan, but it's not -- well, it's not important where they come from as long as they brought great game to play!

												This is a really nice 2D turn-based strategy game. If you like XCOM or Invisible Inc., you should give a try. The mechanics of the game are simple but allow a tremendous range of strategies. The difficulty ramps up smoothly and there is a nice tutorial. Through the story you will have to adapt your gameplay because there are many surprises and changes happening. The monks are a very nice feature that gives many possibilities to play the game. Then the game doesn't get boring even though some levels are quite long. Also the humor and the twisted story keeps the game entertaining.It is a pity that the multiplayer is almost dead. My main cons is the grinding you need to do to get all the achievements once you have finished the game.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but the unit interaction was too limited (there are only 8 unit types and the optimum strategy was always stall by double teaming each unit the AI sends until the AI brings out their general and he invariably overextends), the range of attack was too ambigious (due to using rather imprecise ""rings of movement"" rather then a grid or hex map)  leading to a lot of frustrating restarts because I thought I was just out of range of something and the AI opponent proved me wrong), and the story was too innane for me to sink my teeth into.  It's not a *terrible* TBS, but it's not very good either.  YMMV, but I can't really recommend this game, even with as little competition as this game has in its genre, there are better games 2, 10, ad 15 years old.  Pretty much anything by Nippon Ichi is better than this.			"

												Using the interface with a mouse just ruins this game, it was obviously designed for a touch screen.  Your cursor is a massive clumsy pointer that makes it extremely difficult to select and move units that are close together.  Getting your units in a proper formation is an exercise in frustration, but managable if that was the only problem. Making any moves takes extra clicks because of the limitations of a touch screen first interface.  For example, hovering over units to see their hp doesn't work, you must left-click to select each of them individually to see hp and then click back on the unit you were planning on using (once to select it, once to ""activate"" it, and a third time to make it actually do anything)  These things were solved in the 90s and so the controls feel similar to a bad console port.If you have a windows 8 touchscreen tablet and like games like advance wars this would be great, otherwise avoid it unless you're willing to wrestle with your mouse.

												I somehow acquired this game through some sort of bundle and decided to give it a shot.  I have to say that I was immediately impressed from the start.  The art-style, while cartoonish, is eye-catching and flowed very well.  Games that feature turn-based combat are most certainly not a new concept, but the idea of eating the skulls of your enemies to heal and level up is certainly different. Moving characters around with the mouse does admittedly take some getting used to.  I wouldn't go as far as to say that this is the best turn-based strategy game I've ever played, but I am hard-pressed to find any major faults with it.  Certainly grab it during a sale or in a bundle (like I did) if you can.

Skulls of the Shogun is a 2D game that mixes real time movement and turn based combat with a lovely cartoony graphics style. I'm gonna be honest here, the first time I heard about this game I thought it was some spin-off Total War Shogun only to soon know that these two games had nothing to do with each other.The game starts off with a cutscene of you (General Akamoto) being stabbed in the back and going to the land of the dead and this is where the story starts. In the land of the dead you uncover a plot against the Shogun of the Dead by facing various generals, one on each ""sector"", until you eventually face the Shogun of the Dead himself. Even though at first the story might not seem that appealing to some people, the game dialogue, which is text based, is extremely funny throughout the entire game and I do think that this is one of the main reasons why I enjoyed Skulls of the Shogun so much. The game features both online and local multiplayer along with a single player campaign. Having only played the campaign I can say that it is divided in a number of sectors, one for each season more specifically. Each of these sectors has various levels, usually 4, and each sector/season has a different general and a different army that you will face. The more you progress the more the game slowly teaches you how to use newly acquired units, most of those tips are not actually shoved into your face by some text popping on the screen but, instead, your units will sometimes talk with each other, or the enemy, between turns thus making some sweet funny transitions from one turn to another. The animations are somewhat lacking in my honest opinion but I think the game gets away with it just because I really like the art style and the way they've done the 2D sprites along with the backgrounds and the map design. The cartoony look certainly adds alot of charm to it. I actually didn't payed much attention to themusic and I think part of it it's because I didn't find it to be that good and maybe even a bit repetitive. The core:Gameplay wise the game is a turn based combat game with some minor twists. In each turn you are granted the ability to use or summon 5 units. At first, each unit is only granted one action per turn, but your general can perform 2 actions per turn, and if you lose your general it’s game over. There are a few things you need to keep in mind while playing Skulls of the Shogun, such as, eating skulls heals your units and increases their maximum HP and after eating 3 skulls they will become ""possessed"" which makes them stronger units. By placing two units close enough to each other will create a ""spirit wall"" around them which will prevent them from getting knockbacked by enemy melee attacks and reduces incoming damage. You also need to take in consideration the fact that there are rice fields which you can capture that will grant you rice and heal your unit placed there each round, rice can be used to use certain spells with different types of monks (monks are what you could call ""mages"") and to summon units if you happen to have captured a temple. Monks can be summoned by capturing shrines and there's a specific shrine for each monk along with a shrine that acts as some sort of tower which attacks enemies within range at the end of each turn. You also need to take into consideration the unit placement and the terrain, some levels will have abysses and ice on the floor. Ice will increase the knockback on a unit that is not protected by a spirit wall. Iif you manage to knockback someone to an abyss or from higher ground they will get instantly killed no matter how much HP they had previously. This is actually one of the key strategies to progress in various levels. The unit variety is fairly simple, you have your infantry, which are close range, your cavalry which have more range than the infantry but take more damage and of course you have archers which can attack from afar. As I mentioned earlier, there are also monks, one is a healer, another is a fire monk which plays the same role as an archer and you also have some sort of crow monk which instead of attacking can use wind to push enemies away or friendly units closer to a specific point. At last you have your general which is your main unit, if you kill your enemy general you win and if you lose your general you lose. The campaign takes around 13 hours to beat and it is extremely enjoyable. They actually released a little campaign which is called ""Forgotten Isles"", which adds some levels to the single player campaign but in this add-on you keep the units and the rice you have at end of a level and you bring them with you to the next level thus making it somewhat harder, I actually didn't beat this add-on because I didn't really felt it was actually important to the story, even though it has some. Verdict:Lovely cartoony art styleVery low system requirementsFunny dialogueTactical combatIf you enjoy turn based combat games with some resource management you can't go wrong with Skulls of the Shogun, it is pretty damn good.

												This is one of the most enjoyable turn-based strategy games I've ever played. It's colorful, charasmatc, has a great sense of humor, beautiful art, and most importantly, has just the right amount of depth where it's not too complicated nor too simple. This is a great game for people who are new to the genre, as the game does a really good job of teaching you how all the units, resources, and systems work, yet it still gives you the freedom to figure out things on your own, and get that deep feeling of satisfaction that the genre is well known for. The game works equally well with a gamepad and mouse/keyboard, and the campaign took me a good 18 hours to get through. There is also online and local multiplayer which I haven't dabbled with yet. Overall, this is one of the more underrated games I've played this year. A great turn-based strategy game for noobs and vets alike.			"

												Set in ancient japan the skulls of the shogun beckons the player to take hold of a shogun backstabbed by one of his subordinates during a battle aiming to seek revenge after being reincarnated in the afterlife.  The gameplay consists of a relatively simple but unique turned-based combat system where the player and the AI each take turns commanding their units in a round to either move, attack, or perform other actions until they run out of moves (5 per side).  The player wins if he/she can kill all of enemy units or the enemy general, but must protect his/her own general in the process.   Three types of basic units are available from start including infantry, cavalry, and archer where they can be utilised to work together for maximum effect in a scenario.   Multiple strategies come into play during each scenario which is unique in their own way such as preventing enemy units from counterattacking when they are being attacked, or positioning one's units properly before the end of a round to minimise the damage received during AI's turn--can be accomplished by either running out of enemy's  movement range or hide in a bush which can grant a 20% chance for an attack to miss.  The gameplay can become stale were it not for golden skulls challenges and the succinct degree of humour present in the game which, surprisingly, can be quite amusing and definitely goes a long way in making the gameplay experience more satisfying.  There are also xp for levelling up and emblems you receive at end of each scenario depending on your performance but otherwise they do not have a direct impact on your gameplay, if at all, whether you are level 1 or 10 you do not possess any distinct advantage whatsoever aside from having bestowed a different title each level.  The emblems are purely for asthetic purposes to show off your dedication or time committed to the game, notwithstanding the amount of repetitive grinding just to be able to collect all the rare/very rare emblems either through gameplay or combining them to hopefully obtain the ones you want and then upgrading all or most of them to Gold rank.There is a multiplayer component in addition to the single-player campaign as well.  However, the matchmaking lobby is usually empty majority of times and hence one would have to encompass a gross amount of patience in order to possibly find a mattch courtesy of the ability of the game to continuously search for opponents in the background whilst you wreak havoc in traditional campaign mode or casually browse through the leaderboards and emblems you have amassed.  Despite the near non-existence of an online community, I find the single-player campaign infinitely enjoyable on its own and that alone is enough to make this game remarkably innovative and is a refreshing change from the traditional, stagnant TBS mechanisms			"

												I suspect this was originally an iOS game that got ported to PC. Every operation feels like it takes a few clicks too many, with dull mouse pointer precision, and that really seems to slows down the pace of play. Add to this obsequious zaniness in the plot and dialogue, and Skulls just didn't seem my cup of tea.			"

												Fantastic game, and at a good price as well!It disguises as a very simple game with only 3 basic unit types, but within there is a deep pool of strategy to master. There are 4 different ""monk"" units on top of the 3 basic units, and your general. The monks all have different and unique abilities, most of them cannot directly attack enemies, but instead use spells. Due to the circular movement instead of hexagon based it also offers heavy use of skilled positioning.The single player campaign is challenging and fun, and will take you at the very least 10 hours but probably more like 15-20. The dialogue is pretty funny and the missions are well crafted.The multiplayer is incredibly fun and will last you for a long time, the only unfortunate thing with this game is that the multiplayer is very deserted, but if you actually get a game going it's good fun. You should try to get some friends who also own this game and play multiplayer with them, seeing as getting strangers is difficult. There are a lot of different multiplayer maps, although some are slightly unbalanced they are overall really good.The game also offers a lot of replayability on single player levels. There are three ""golden skulls"" on each level that you can acquire by fulfilling certain conditions (example: Win without attacking with any other unit than your general), these conditions are different for every map, the example I used is only present on one level.I also feel like I should point out that the art style is really unique and cool, and I like the sound assets as well.I can't really discredit the game for a deserted multiplayer, so I will personally rate it 9/10 (because the 10/10 game doesn't exist yet)For a large list of what the game contains in mechanics and gameplay, see my thread here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/228960/discussions/0/864972399789762136/ "

												So, a bunch of the games I've been posting about lately have not been (in my opinion) ""great"". This is not at all true of Skulls of the Shogun﻿. This highly polished turn-based tactics/strategy game isn't overly complex (it's got a great tutorial), but remains deep enough to be satisfying for higher-level play, with additional rewards for particularly skilled play.And I'm totally uninterested in playing it right now.While I can't say that I'm a huge aficionado of the genre (tactics and/or strategy), I have enjoyed games of this type in the past, and while I would generally consider myself to be ""not very good"" at strategy/tactics, I think it's important to challenge myself from time-to-time. But right now I'm just not in the mood, so this game will go into the pile labeled ""revisit"" (a designation for games that I either wish to replay, or games that I didn't feel like playing but think that I should try again later).I would certainly recommend this game, however, and It's available on many platforms (PC/Mac/Linux, some—but not all—Sony/Microsoft consoles, as well as iOS).

												This game has the most unintuitive interface I've seen. Switching between units, deactivating them, cancelling moves or actions feels unnatural, it's hard to get used to the controls, so commanding your troops becomes a chore.And the campaign encounters are terribly designed. You get a few tutorial missions that are very easy for the most part, but then you get thrown into a fight with a mini boss that attacks 3 times per round and has a pocket healer, making the encounter unbelievably unbalanced and difficult. If the tutorial is so badly designed, I don't even want to see what else there is to this game.			"

												Storyline seems like it would be funny, love the time and effort the designers put into the artwork, but the sad truth is the controls were too clumsy and backasswards to be playable. I often found myself clicking on the wrong unit due to the way the sprites overlapped, then wasting that unit's turn in the process of trying to change to the unit I was originally intending.I tried to like this game, I really did, but the controls ruin it for me.

												I found that the user interface, particulary the mouse control/selection has a lot of issue. The art direction is top-notch, but the gameplay itself gets meh very quickly. The randomness of the result of some actions is very annoying, as it will make or break a game too often. Doing all the right things and losing because all of the enemies are in cover, and missing every single 80% ""roll"" is no fun at all.			"

You're not going to find a deep game you're going to play forever. In fact, there are definitely some glaring issues in the way that it plays. But you know what? That's just fine.

												GENEOUS... PURE GENEOUS on an epic level.This is by for the most dynamic strategy board game I have ever player... I'm not comparing this to Warhammer, so don't think I'm referring to massive game boards like that... this is more twice to four times the size of chess, with about the same number of pieces.Yes, I compare this game to chess... I dare say that this game is the evolution of chess. There are no spaces, or square counts. There is movement distantce and proximity combined with ranged attacks... If you attack with a piece, be careful to make sure you have some movement left over (the little thing white circle tells you that).The controls are clever, elegant... Not complicated or complex. The map variety is nice, though we could use bigger maps for two players to face off with massive armies like the 4v4 fujin falls map, not the 2v2 version.All in all, this game sets a very high bar, and a new standard of board games.This game gives you the biggest bang for your buck on steam without a doubt.BUY IT!!! Learn it. Enjoy it! P.S.The campaign has to be the best tutorial i have every played. Very funny and enjoyable story. "

												Pretty much Advance Wars except instead of tile based, linear movement you got move anywhere within a circle. Very strategy-based, and the movement mechanic makes it very tough to play defensively because even though you can form ""Spirit Walls"" to avoid knockback and soak up more damage you can easily be run around. Can be tough if you're not used to turn based strategy like this, but I get the feeling this is probably rather easy to experienced genre players. Really like the art, writing and gameplay. More classes could be cool, but it's still in development so we'll see.			"

												Skulls of the Shogun is an amazing TBS. After finishing the game itself, I liked every singe bit of it, even with the added levels. There are different ways to get different units and the controls are incredibly simple, even if there so many things to remember and get used to. The level designs are great and the overall level itself gives people a challenge. They would have to think it through before making a move. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have fun, have time to kill, or both as the levels can be pretty funny at some times and can be long too.			"

												I used to love turn based strategy games (FFT especially), but they've gotten pretty stale for me as of late.  I didn't think I would enjoy Skulls too much, but I checked it out on a lark... and I'm so glad I did!  Skulls seems to be a casual take of a turn based strategy game at first (similar to what Swords and Soldiers HD did for real time strategy), but there's a surprising amount of depth in its options and gameplay.  New stages gradually introduce the player to classes, helpful spirits, environmental dangers and skill sets.  Actually, I think this gradual integration of mechanics continued until the very end!  The Cartoon Network-style visuals turned me off at first, but they grew on me and now I find them charming haha... same with the dialogue.  Don't expect anything deep from Skull's narrative, but it's fun and not as heavy handed as most strategy games out there.  Skulls can be quite brutal at higher difficulties, and I shamefully admit I had to reduce the difficulty to casual on some of the later levels... enemy AI can be tricky so much strategy and prior planning is necessary.

												This is an innovative, elegant and accessible (not to mention very fun) turn based startegy game. In fact, I think it may be the best small-scale TBS game released on PC in recent years! Core gameplay draws heavily on the (excellent) Advance Wars series, but swaps out large armies and extensive unit rosters for small-ish scale battles that carry a real sense of streamlined elegance and tactical choice, without losing the crucial magic of turn-by-turn strategic oneupmanship enjoyed by its spiritual predecessors. The gridless movement system works surprisingly well and makes the game feel fresh as a result, and teh campaign is quite meaty and enjoyable too. Oh, and the 'progression system' touted in the trailer alarmed me when I first heard  about it, but it's a strictly cosmetic thing, so multiplayer matches remain 100% fair. If you have even the slightest interest in TBS games, pick this one up!			"

Sure the story and characters may not be as deep as a fire emblem or a final fantasy tactics title, but the free form movement and other augmentations to the base genre setup more than over come it and make for a great little game.The tone and humor are also pretty cool and really do help to set this apart and make it worth your time and money to play through.

I can't recommend it enough to Turn-based strategy fans!!Pros:+great gameplay mechanics    +the story and dialogues are very funny  +great visual  +controller support   +multiplayer and challengesCons:- occasionally, the manual will disappear upon taking a screenshot; a restart can fix the problem			"

												Skulls of the Shogun is both challenging and entertaining. The game utilizes a colorful, cartoony and fun style while also featuring slightly serious combat, making you think about your strategy and the fine placement of your troops or else you will die. And the game does a good job reminding you of it, as failures will be often if you don't quickly adopt the right state of mind. It's important to note that the game is not frustrating, but pleasantly challenging, a fine line that I feel many games overstep. While the campaign's comedy is kinda cheesy, it features a good story and excellent multiplayer. Me and my friends enjoy the hotseat option, like a virtual board game!			"

												Refreshing little strategy game about zombie samurai. It's fun. It's polished. The writing is cute. The combat is unique enough to be interesting. Overall it's a refreshing take on the turn-based strategy genre.Edit: I should point out that the difficulty is reaaaally lacking though. If you're looking for a strategy game challenge, look elsewhere.Cool featuresMove a unit, attack, and move some more.Move unit A. Move unit B. Change mind about position of unit A. Undo unit A's move back to its original position.Eat fallen enemies to charge up your units, eventually granting a demon form that allows two attack actions per turn.Capture resource nodes to grow rice to feed new recruits.100% compatible with Xbox 360 controller.

												This game here is a gem that has not received the attention it really deserves. The entire set up is completely well done. From presentation to balance, Skulls brings extremely fun gameplay with an excellent balance truly rivaling something a kin to chess. Every move you make matters, every position you place your troops in and every new addition you add to your army will determine whether or not you can succeed in competitive multiplayer. The single player experience is an enjoyable way to spend some time but the multiplayer will keep you coming back for more.For any strategy game fans that love things like fire emblem, advance wars, or even tactics type games. I can not recommend this enough.			"

												A few things that I like about this gameThe movement system: Skulls of the shogun, rather than having a traditional hexagon/square tile system, allows you to freely move your units within a movement range circle that shrinks as you move.Combat: This game doesn't over complicate the combat system by having a million different rules and exceptions, the combat system is pretty basic (3 main types of units with several unique spell caster units and a general) while still leaving room for a lot of strategy Orders: Every turn you can order a maximum of 5 units, which I really like because it involves more strategy, neither you or your opponent can utilize their entire army at once, it forces the player to make smart decisionsThe story/campaign: You take the role of the recently deceased Akomoto, a general in feudal Japan, who reveling in his greatest triumph, was stabbed in the back by your former second in command and sent to the land of the dead. Your second in command, who also died shortly after killing you, and has convinced everyone that HE is the great general and taken your rightful place in the paradise of the afterworld, you quickly organize a rebellion in an effort to take back your name and get revenge on the coward who stabbed you in the back. Long story short, the story is funny and entertaining while allowing for some interesting game mechanicsEasy to pick up: This point is really important for me, the game is easy to learn (goes back to not being overly complicated) and fun to play if you don't have a ton of time. Looking at a similar game, like Civ, once you start a game it takes a long time to finish. Skulls of the Shogun has fast paced gameplay that you can get into in only a few minutes, while still being difficult enough to give you an enjoyable challenge.Overall I really like the game, and I think just completing the campaign, should last you around 20+ hours, I would highly recommend it for a pretty unique strategy game focused more on combat/tactics than other turn based strategy games that require you to build up an army first.

												Its a fun game, as long as youre not looking for an ""advance wars"" substitute. It has a lot of similarities, but overall, its not as deep or organized as AW. It still does a pretty good job as an strategy game and the jokes are also very funny. The only main problem its that sometimes its difficult to select the right unit when there are many too close among each other, and sometimes you may give the wrong order just because you were too fast to see what option you were selecting.

												I've played many Strategy games in the past and this is a very refreshing, creative, and easy to play game that I could recomend to anyone! It's a very simplifyed turn based game simular to the Fire emblem series with creative twists and turns in the battlefield! In the end this is a Masterpiece for pick up and play kinda gamers, it's replay value is decent and it's pretty original, I'd give it a eight out of ten, if it had alittle more units and had alittle more features to keep matches going it would easily be a 9 out of 10. Totally a must buy, ASPECIALLY during this sale.			"

												32 hours and beat all the levels in the game, Overall the game has great humor; I laughed but depending on the person it could be too corny. Gameplay wise it's a turn-based squad game where you move your entire team then your opponent does after you end your turn.Multiplayer is a struggle at certain times of day, but it's multiplatform so there might be a few players playing.  I give this game a positive review for delivering a decent story, original gameplay, and a finished  worthy product that deserves a playthroughOne of my first indie games and was part of the 'pre-order' before it's release on Steam. This is one of the most interesting indie turn-based strategy game you can get. It is not like the other kinds of indie rip-off trash that is dumped and released daily on Steam nowadays. I highly recommend this game.			"

I will update this post if the problem has been resolved, but for now. My excitement has turned into frusteration and dissapointment.			"

												Difficult to sum up how much I dislike the UI of this game. I know that this is mostly caused because Skulls of the Shogun is  a casual game, with a touchscreen friendly UI. But for strategy vets there is barely anything more annoying than a lacking UI, that leaves me guessing or missing relevant information. Furthermore I also disliked unit control, up to simple stuff as keyboard shortcuts. It annoyed me so much that I won't keep playing an otherwise probably decent game.			"

												This is a moderately tolerable tablet TBS.   4K support is okay.  Graphics are fairly low resolution, however, but it was made for tablets.   Controls were only ported over to PC enough that it's playable, barely, which makes them very clunky.  Maybe if you have a touchscreen you'll do better with it. Gameplay is quite uninteresting and horribly simplistic compared to dedicated PC strategy games, leaving the gamer wondering why they're bothering with such a downgrade in the gaming experience.This doesn't really belong on PC at all.

												Skulls of the shogun is one of the better tactical turn based games I've played. The style is very consistent and, though based on Japanese art, still very original. I quite like its comicy style.The story seems basic, but the dialogues are fun to read, makes it very lighthearted.The gameplay is very good too. It's not easy so you do have to think and plan quite ahead. This is what usually bothers me with tactical turn based games, is that theyre too easy. Here, there is some challenge and you feel really happy when youve finished a stage.The only downside is that I've got no clue how the multiplayer works. There seems to be an online one but I don't get it. I never find any games to join. Wish there was a more of an explanation for this... or how to play the multiplayer.It can't just be that theres no one there, right? I'd love to play this in multiplayer!			"

												This is the real deal. The creators say they based the game on Advance Wars, and it really does take all the best gameplay elements from that game while developing its own unique feel. It offers the best tactical and strategic gameplay since Fire Emblem, a series I have a great amount of respect for. The only criticism so far is that the dialogue in the campaign mode contains tons of references that feel REALLY forced. The Super Mario Bros. and Anchorman quotes made sense in the context of the story, but the references really got out of hand when one of the characters quoted lyrics from Poison's ""Every Rose has its thorns"" for no reason (something like this happens at least once per cutscene). But the gameplay is 100% solid. You have multiple viable commands to give your units every turn, and the pacing of aggression versus gaining strength almost always presents a few gripping decision points per turn. This game is absolutely worth the $5 price tag.			"

												Absolutely Fantastic. A real treasure of a turnbased strategy game that is nearly flawless.This is a simple easy to learn turn based strategy game that is fun from the first few seconds of play yet has  plenty of strategy and is wonderful to play hot seat with a friend. The campain is an incredibley well thought out tutorial and is the right level of humor and challenge.There are a lot of really cool concepts in this game, hitting enemies knocks them back, and by pushing enemies around cleverly you can deal extra damage or instantly kill them by knocking them into the water. Standing units next to eachother lets you form walls. Linked units can't be pushed or be crossed or shot over by enemy archers, making formation important. When a unit dies their skull remains. Eating Skulls restores HP, unlock spells for magic users and feeding a unit 3 skulls upgrades them to being able to do an extra attack per turn. I could just keep going, just trust me this game is worth checking out.Furthermore it has the best cross platform system I've ever seen. Not only is there online play across all platforms but your profile and save file carries over too. So I can play this game with my phone on the bus, and continue the campain at home on my PC. "

If your into Advanced Wars or strategy games this is a must play. Plenty of maps to keep you busy trying to collect all of the skulls & also the story is pretty damn funny. Also has multiplayer & controller support (never used the mouse). It has some flaws (questionable AI at times) & character selection.  If you can get it on special like I did that's even better.			"

												a fun turn based strategy that allows you to upgrade your units mid battle and gain additional skill or traits. I Haven't tried the multiplayer mode though.			"

												This game has a highly intuitive and fun combat system. I've barely played it, and so i don't know how it is in the later game, but if you like the strategy genre and want something new, you should definitely try it out!			"

												This game is somthing different and fresh for the steam community. Although this game as a small learning curve to playing this game, but it's quite fun and crazy with Different units and idols you can ""haunt"" to spawn monks with different spells that change the battlefield to your favor. The four player online is just maddening fun (trying my best without making a bone joke). IT EVEN HAS LOCAL MUILTIPLAYER, I don't even know another local pc game. Believe me your eyes are gonna pop out of your skulls over the strategic fun, although your a skelleton you do not have eyes YOHOHOHO			"

												Estou me divertindo MUITO com esse jogo!! Pode parecer meio inacessível pelo gênero (estratégia), mas na realidade é bem o contrário. A curva de aprendizado é muito suave, e há boas doses de humor, o que acaba deixando a atmosfera bem mais leve. Joguei cerca de 1/4, mas já posso afirmar que vale a pena, e muito! Mal posso esperar pra testar o modo multiplayer. Deem uma chance!			"

												This is a great squad based strategy game, especially for beginners, but I can't reccomend getting it now unless you have some friends willing to play with you. (The online multiplayer is barren, and the campaign is great but short).			"

												I don't understand why the developer would charge half the price on Windows Store. That version is also touch friendly.About the game itself, it is a 2D turn based strategy game with a new concept. Instead of movements being grid based, you can select any point within the range to move a unit. However, it is also frustrating as a lot of time is spent in trying to position your unit. It is also difficult to protect a damaged unit by covering with other units.The story setting is quite interesting. It is a recommend but not a strong recommend.			"

												Despite being a rather old game , i find that this game is still fun and hard for old who didnt tried it or havent played strategy games before this might be a good start as the controls are easy to learn and easy to execute. This game also has a unique storyline and interesting one. i would definetely say that this game is worth its price tag			"

												Skulls of the Shogun takes basic concepts from turn-based strategy games like Advance Wars, simplifies and streamlines them, and makes the experience play like an arcade strategy game with surprising depth beneath the surface. The presentation is top-notch and the setting (the Japanese underworld) seems perfectly suited for this game. Aside from the campaign, there are various multiplayer options, including couch co-op, making it a perfect game to play with friends and loved ones.			"

												It's just a good, easy-to-play, fun, little rock solid strategy game. I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this for 5 bucks last year but I've played it a ton.  If your into Advanced Wars or strategy games this is a must play. Plenty of maps to keep you busy trying to collect all of the skulls & also the story is pretty damn funny. Also has multiplayer & controller support (never used the mouse). It has some flaws (questionable AI at times) & character selection.  If you can get it on special like I did that's even better.			"

												I remember quite fondly, from my High School days, reading about this game in the good ol PC gamer magazine. I remember reading the words ""Just another game killed my Mircosoft"". This was because, you see, Microsoft wanted this game in particular on their storefront, and not on a place where it'll get noticed. Glad to see either Microsoft realized that this game would've been about as skeletal in terms of success as the men you play as, or maybe the devs broke contract or something and now its here. Regardless;I get some serious Fire Emblem vibes from the skeletal plain contained within the coding in this game. Just a game of chess, right? A bunch of dudes with one really powerful piece that is both the queen and king, each with different abilities slowly brough forth; like a five course dinner complete with sixteen different forks that are each meant for different purposes, and a sense of humor only comparable to your uncle rodney, as he makes slightly gross jokes at the dinner table because he thinks he is the coolest thing on the planet since the creation of the electric knife, but they're actually not quite that funny, or gross. Oh yeah. He's a pun man too.Fire Emblem is a very fair comparsion, but unlike FE, there are without a doubt a few issues with the game. In FE, what you saw is what you got. If a foe was in range, congrats, you can gallop right up to them, and shove your anime spear right into their anime chest. Here, you get circles rather than the usual grid FE gives you. If you reside outside the circle, more-or-less, you can still be a target, and frequently are. This forces you to try to think further outside the circle as you decide if your archer is safe or not, to find that he was not, in fact, safe. Speaking of archers, the game doesn't quite to a good job at giving you the information you need, Both archers had an 80% chance to hit the dude.In Pokemon for a comparison, that means it hits every time no matter what basically. Here, it means you just get to miss. Every single time. They have this thing where when you kill a dude, you can eat his skull and gain health back, and increase your max health. Eat three and you turn into a demon. Ineed, canniballism is the slippery slope to demonic possession. In your new form, you can move twice, which also means you can attack twice, which generally spells out more demonic doings, and its enjoyable to see your troops become said demons.The reward is excellent.Beating a level is just as satifying in FE as it is here. You feel like a real tactitian.As the friend who got me this gem told me; ""Nothing like a good strategy game."" Amen to that. 8/10.I didn't talk much about the art style, but its cute and you can very easily see what is what, and that's all I needed out of it.Music is pretty good too. Hard to go wrong, aye?

												For me it`s really surprising that the game is so unpopular. Like everything about it is soo god, characters are interesting and well-thoughtthrough, atmosphere is very cozy, humour is specific, but nice, and gameplay is like nothing else. Rounding it up for me it was 10/10. Now for the russian audience: Я реально не понимаю: почему игра такая непопулярная, в ней просто чудесно все: персонажи, геймплей, атмосфера, шутехи. Одним словом 10/10 "
