												Not a bad game for a beta. Lambda Wars is very similar to the first Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War games. There are outposts and energy generators, as well as base building for upgrades and better units.In this game you can play as both the Combine and the Rebels, both are pretty well balanced. The rebels excel in overpowering the enemy through numbers while the combine have single, powerful units such as the Strider. You can also launch headcrabs into the enemy base to to turn them into zombies. That's always fun. And it's also completely free, there are no micro-transactions.Every unit in the game are those from Half Life, there are Hunters, Striders, Zombies, etc. It could use some work, but it's definitely worth playing if you like Half Life and/or RTS games.

												Half Life fans rejoice! THIS is the Half Life themed RTS Mod we've been waiting for. Players of Dawn of War will recognize the simple, base building components like requisition and power in order to build and upgrade, and if you haven't played DoW in the past, then it shouldn't take you more than a few minutes to understand the base building. So far I have not encountered any frame drops or crashing issues with the mod and the gameplay overall feels really smooth and comfortable. The Mod does have offline play with bots as well as online play already so that is a good thing. I can not wait to see what this Mod has in store for us in the future.One request though: Ravenholm map please :)			"

			Lambda Wars // HL² Wars		


I remember good  old days when Lambda Wars previously called HL² Wars  used to require almost all Orange Box composents in order to run properly it was damn insane but already worth it! Now the classic  Half Life 2 RTS is back as a free Standalone just available in one click on Steam, it's a must have grab it!  As far as i'm concerned i've never been considered myself as a RTS playertype but Lambda Wars is one of those exceptions alongside Insects Infestation  certainly because I'm indie/mods addicted since λ generation..

												First off, this game strongly reminds me of Dawn of War (requisition, power generators, the building types, etc.), which is definitely not a bad thing. I'm a big fan of the Half Life universe and the units in this RTS interpretation of it fit the original enemies/friends perfectly. It does feel a little bumpy at times, with striders occasionally glitching out and sounds cutting out, but the game clearly states that it is in beta, and it's free, so taking that into consideration this game is certainly worth any fan of the RTS genre or Half Life series' time.

												This game is beyond expectations for a beta. I am very glad I voted it to be on steam. But there are some things I would love to see added.1.A sell/demolition button on buildings2. (Not really sure if I want this or not) Maybe a new faction, give a selection of diffrent factions rather than 2.3.More units and buildings, would love for ever.4.Some thing for the rebels to throw at the combine, combine got head crabs give the rebels something to work with.5. Viechles.6. More missions.			"

												Half-Life 1 = Amazing.Half-Life 2 = AWESOME!Half-life 2-based-RTS game? = SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!-----------------------------------------------------------------------Would pay for this, being a full on game. I was searching for an awesome RTS, while getting bored of W40K, and Army Men RTS. This game, is really awesome. The idea of having a HL2 universe RTS was in the air for a while i'd say, but actually having it and playing it was another thing. I am very pleased  to congratulate the creators of Lambda Wars, to say that they have done an amazing job. Keep up the great work!			"

												I have played Lambda Wars during development and I must say this game has transformed itself beautifully over time. The way the developers turned Half Life 2 in something completely new is really promising and the game takes place in a universe everyone can't get enough of.Lambda Wars has been in development for nearly 5 years (I think) and now you can play it for NOT A SINGLE PENNY. Respect for the developers and this wonderful standalone mod!			"

												This is -the- HL2 RTS. The game itself is pretty damn good, with both factions having a quite different gameplay, and an interesting amount of tactics to use. All the iconic HL2 npcs are around, ranging from combine to hunters, even striders, while rebels can safely have much higher numbers and even units like a flamethrower or the saboteur.The devs go on periodically about working on features and adding on the game, but the best part is that they actually listen to people in the forums, and if you find bugs, they might just talk to you directly to find more information. All in all, coupled with the fact it's completely free, I just don't see why someone wouldn't play this. And if you're a Half Life fan, you're in for a treat.			"

												Personally one of the buggiest  RTSes I've ever played. Given this is an Early Access/beta game I should probably expect this anyways.The units don't hold still and go off to do whatever unless you explicitly order then to hold position, which can be a pain until you get used to it.Sometimes units won't man turrets if you give the order to them to man it when they're far away from said turret.As Combine you can build multiple scrap energy gens ontop of eachother (Not actually sure what I did to cause this)The only gamemode I've really played a lot of Overrun. The other gamemode is really just a free reskinned Company Of Heroes with a tiny bit of Dawn of War I thrown in. The only reason I played the other gamemodes is to write this review (And actually I was honestly suprised by them, the rest of the game is pretty damn good)Though it does have some interesting ideas, like Scrap for the Rebels and Stalkers being able to build/repair from afar.The Dark Energy Reactor for the Combine is pretty creative, kinda just generators and Pylons from SC2 at onceOnly the Combine get vehicles of any kind (sadface). And their units are more powerful.The Combine have a lot higher tech(And by that I mean fun things like mortars, headcrab canisters, synths, etc) and more buildings, more abilities, etc. I like the Scrap idea for the rebels, I like their stuff made out of random crap. Maybe they could hijack enemy stuff, that might help balance it. I would like it if the rebels just... Had more. More types of units, vehicles at a vehicle shop building ,etc. Still, the Combine appear to be getting a lot more love, content, and other stuff than the poor Rebels are. Only thing the Rebels have is it's a lot easier for them to build a lot more units and other than that nothing, they just don't have any of the cooler stuff the Combs have. One last thing, in Overrun, it always gets stuck with one antlion or whatever stuck somewhere, and the entire thing stops, no more waves :/Honestly, it's free, and it's not really bad, give it a shot if you want to, have some fun.

												Combine and Rebels.I played Half-Life 2 for the first time in 2004 when Steam started to exist (tho on my LICENSED DISK I had no steam oddly enough) and Half-Life 2 gave a lot of bugs with AI_DISABLED error. I was (around) 10 years old back then.I was always imagining built bases when I was in toilet taking a dump. A corner of the bathroom was always a base of Rebels and I always imagined like a scrap yard (with crates and stuff) stacked and having those rebels collect it to build villages. This was roughly 7-8 years ago (I am 20 now).Later, around 3 years after I was drawing this kind of thing on a sheet. I imagined mini-citadels constructed by The Combine and Rebels on the other corner of this sheet. There were empty bases you could capture and use for improving one's side.2009 - This was the first time I met ""Half-Life 2 Wars"", it was in early alpha stage and was practically completely undeveloped. It was running on HL2:DM engine and you could already select units with your mouse and move them around (though, I must admit, they were really buggy, since the path finding for bots was terrible back then). I played it a bit, though I did not understand it was Early Alpha and simply forgot about it.2 more years after, when I learned mapping with Hammer Editor I made a few large maps with some already built-in bases. Shame they weren't that detailed and they server no purpose. But at least I got what I wanted to see.So I imagined all this and hoped that one day this would turn into a Strategy game. And it did. And funnily enough, would it be a coincidence - it all came out exactly in the way I imagined when I was a kid! This is like a dream!!!I don't know how else I can express my emotions, when I tried out Lambda Wars (previously known as Half-Life 2 Wars), I was not simply impressed and excited. I was happy. Half-Life universe is the universe I always loved more than any other (even S.T.A.L.K.E.R or Metro 2033; any other post-apocalyptic environment).I always wanted to be able to manipulate Combine forces. I got to do that during 13.1 hours of my CURRENT (as I write this) gameplay.I am willing to help this mod improve any way possible. I am ready for anything, I am ready to put all my effort of mapping into it, texturing and sound editing, because this genre was always my favourite. But now with HL2 universe?F#ck yeah!P.S: To all who find this game 'boring' - don't bother then. Why? If you never played Comand & Conquer or Age of Empires, or you simply didn't find it ""your thing"" you will never understand how it feels to play a RTS version of Half-Life 2. Oh boy, especially if you haven't played Half-Life 2. Or don't like it.P.S 2: I heard Zombie faction (or Antlion faction) will appear later on. Man how awesome can it be?			"

(Jeep, Airboat, working civilian vehicles, Armored Personnel Carrier, Hunter-Chopper)- Units to ""power"" the facility (When working at PC, Combine Interface)- NEW GAMEMODE: Defend the civilians, VIP, Hostages (Example: Doc Breen, Doc Kleiner, Alyx, Barney, etc)- Melee units (Crowbar, Stunstick)- Customizable Team Logo- Vote Kick option- Fixed server crash (When someone disconnects in game startup) ""Be replaced with bot""Consider these ideas to be a crucial part of the gameplay, many other HL2 fans like me would be thinking the same thing.""Please nerf the rebels"" "

												Destroy enemy as fast as possible simulator 20147/10 would throw keyboard out of window again because I just got attacked by 20 RPG rebels.Alright, let me get serious-no♥♥♥♥♥♥johnson here.The game itself is beyond my expectations for a beta, though there are SERIOUS balance changes still needing to be made.-Rebel constructor building speed needs to be decreased-Rebel scrap/requistion required for triage/vortigaunt/specops needs to be increased.-Combine striders need nerfed.-Headcrabs need nerfed-Rebel Vetran crossbow damage needs to be decreased, as well as health-Rebel RPG needs damage decrase.-----Other than that, Great game!

												Lambda Wars is a really good game. If you play RTS games already then you wont really need to go into the tutorial, but just remember that as Rebels you need to get scrap and as Combine you need to get power.So far I've only played Annihilation but it's a really fun mode, offline or online, bots or no bots, though I recommend playing against real players. The only downside I've encountered so far is that there were 2 rather mean people who try to 2v1 you or put you with easy bots, who then go to say you were easy, despite them rushing to get the strongest troops. Aside from that, a really great mod! I recommend this mod to Half Life fans and RTS fans. If you don't like RTS, try it anyway, you might just like it! The gameplay is simple once you understand the controls and what the goals of each mode are, and how to get the stronger troops, all that.If you don't like Half Life or RTS, I don't know why you're on this page in the first place.

												One thing you have to know about this game is tactics.While the game may seem like your usual build-up-an-army-thats-big-and-kill-stuff it truly is something else.The game requires you to use different strategies for what side you are on.It may seem like the Combine have a huge advantage over the Rebels but, that is only if you use the same tactics for both sides.The Combine's tactic is to build a strong military to utterly crush the resistanceThe 'Rebs on the other hand rely on their numbers to attack the 'Bines before their military progresses too largely to be delt withSimplified is this:  Combine = strength   Rebels = speed and numbersIt can be a little hard to get used to the Rebels tactics, so if your getting used to the game's controls, it's best to start with the Combine.Overall 10/10  The best build and attack game I have ever played (Hope they add in vehicles!)Things I hope they add into the game.-A world faction, basically a faction that spectates and can occasionally drop in things like antlions and zombies to keep bothe sides at bay.-VEHICLESVEHICLESVEHICLESVEHICALS			"

												Although I haven't play much of the game, I have played multiplayer and understood the basics of the RTS within this game. I felt like the game was a combination of Starcraft and Company of Heroes although there are some bugs within the multiplayer, the overall experience of implementing gmod characters into this game was superb and excellently done. I hope to see the progression of the game design, and many more thank you for creating this game. Also yes I'd recommend you guys play this game as well.			"

												Doing perfectly fine for a beta. I've always been a big fan of the Half-Life universe, and seeing it reach out to real-time strategy rather than step back into more of the same FPS element makes me, and countless other fans very happy. Good soundtrack, decent-looking UI, and acceptable sound quality. I'd also like to say I really like the way the developers engaged and adapted Half-Life's assets from FPS to RTS. For example being given the ability to build Headcrab Canister Launchers when playing as the Combine and then bomb the ♥♥♥♥ out of the Rebels, or giving the Rebels the ability to enable a blitz buff when you send your rebellious, defiant units to rush into Combine territory. As far as my complaints and requests, I'd say the AI is at times really silly, but I guess AI will always be annoying especially in this sort of game. It would be good to see more maps, and greater map detail as well, albeit I'm certain the developers are already working on it at the moment. Another thing that would be fantastic would be another faction, one for the Antlions. Now that could make things a lot more intense and interesting, giving us a setting sort of like StarCraft's -- two military forces warring against each other, and at the same time holding their ground against the menace of the unrelenting evil icky gross hive-mind controlled insectoid ew-gross aliens. In any case, I'm as hopeful and expectant in the final product as all the many other fans that are anxious to see a good game come out of this.			"

												This game is an amazing RTS that combines the Setting of Half-Life 2 and mixes it up with the brilliance of Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War. Yet, the game is really buggy but seriously worth it. The game is fun interesting and has the potenital for being the best F2P game this year. If you like Real Time Strategies like Command And Conquer or Dawn of War, the gameplay should the same. The controls are the same as Dawn of War, just with a skin of Half-Life 2 on top of. As for graphics, pretty much it's Half-Life 2. They're great, the Source Engine still looks great even after being around for ten years. However, they could've been better, like in Black Mesa but thats only a minor complaint. The game is very buggy, since it's still in Beta. The frame rate is very choppy and inconsitant.  But still its a great game. Gameplay: 8/10 Great. Could've been a bit different to Dawn of WarGraphics: 7/10  Half-Life 2 Episode 3 Controls: 9/10 Arrow Keys. Really?Buggyness (The higher rating, the less bugs there are): 6/10Overall: 7.5/10 Good, needs improvements			"

												This game is amazing. I was skeptical at first because I heard it was lost in 2007, but it's fully playable, up to a competition level.The neat thing about this game is it looks so professionally done, you'd think it was a standalone engine, but, it's just modded half life 2- with certain textures made bigger smaller/ and all the NPCs are the same as half life 2! Just certain peramaters.2nd thing is the simulated bullet time-you actually have to macro around your units, split them up when fighting, becausew damage isn't dealt by just right clicking and the unit does a certain amount, each gun has accuracy, and you can miss. It's basically like sending out NPC's with certain guns and telling them to duke it out.Imagine if you played half life 2 from this perspective. Essentially you are a commander for the rebels, or the synth for the Combine, TOP-Down flush the enemy out.+reccomended +1 !! "

												This is by far the best mod for a game that isn't half-life, made to be half-life. Aside from the bugs I enjoyed it thoroughly, the combine seemed to be over-powered because they can make energy much faster than that of the rebels who need to collect scrap that only five workers can be working on at a time. other than that and the fact that combine have vehicles, auto sentries and head crablaunchers, I'd say it was pretty fantastic.- The Over run Gametype needs to be fixed for some maps- Player colors are to bright for a post-apoctalyptic setting- AI is not very smart- units aren't smart enough to go around objects and get snagged on barricades occasionaly- Rebels have a sever lack of heavy units- Rebels units seem to be weaker- Rebels have to man turrets- manhacks destroy rebels- rebels salvage inefficient- overall the rebels suck, they could use some hero's, like barney, alyx, and dog- air support would be niceI really enjoy it and am looking forward to future updates.

So badly. My computer feels like 5 years old with sh*tty hardware. (Still Beta tho', more room for improvement)So, in the meantime(since no optimizaztion), 8/10.

Product received for free
												Lambda wars. Ahh... What can i say. One of the Greatest Free RTSes on steam (I think its the only free RTS on steam)So let me tell you what the things you might like about this game:*2 Diffrently styled factions to chose*Infinite strategy's you can use to your advantage*Keeps you on the edge*Nothing makes you think so much as this game does. *You will love it forever no matter what. (Since it's HL settings is so unique)Only thing that i think is sad about the game that we still are kinda limited with the same options. So i feel like in the future we will have Variety of diffrent options,buildings and diffrent trops to make.So overall. You should try it since its free. You don't lose anything if you try. nor you lose anything when you don't like it. So i think Every HL fan should try it out. but i guess its just my opinion. Anyway have tons of fun with this RTS and i hope you will enjoy your time with it.			"

												Not a bad game, deffinetly worth a try - I highly reccomend. Takes allot from the orignal Company Of Heroes (which I adorded). I assumed I would need HL2, but even for a free game it's not required; which is amazing.I got a few great hours of gameplay, but I feel the game takes too much from Company Of Heroes tactical gameplay and territory control and then mixes it with Starcraft factions (for combine anyway), which mixes a wierd Protoss playstyle for combine and a cassual, slow start for the rebels. I can't tell if combine are just all-around better or the game is keeping too true to the half-life universe, it should be a equal playing field for both factions. The combine mid and late game is just far too powerful (which I honestly love, I just wish another faction was implemented and rebels buffed so it was even).I believe for this game to be really enjoyable it needs to take the full set of tactical thinking from Company Of Heroes, by that I mean a possible ability-tree. The combine have a headcrab missile which has around 1/4 of the map in range, which is exactly what this games needs to finish stalemate battles when two teams become locked in. Expect instead of a building maybe like I said an ability-tree, I would also like to see actual air units. Like combine transports - at least in the ability-tree, like the pelican trasnport system in Halo: Wars on the xbox 360. And of course the same for the rebals in their own forms. Or maybe even man-made tunnels and map manipulation to get a geological advantage against the oppisition.I do reccomend this game, and I compare it to Company of Heroes because of its territory and resource system. But for all I know the developers don't even intend to make it this alike, they may even be trying for a Warhammer - 40,000: Dawn of War 2 style. Or maybe they intend for it to be more original than I seem to be seeing it. But it IS BETA, I forgive games for lacking in faction balance, and I all-around believe this can be one great game. Highly reccomend. "

												Lambda Wars is fantastic. It sounds good on paper, and it works as a game. I love playing both alone and with friends. I only have one problem with the game. Once you've killed all the enemies, it does not allow you to continue. I find this very annoying, as I've gathered a massive army, and now I am unable to continue my reign.

SHORT VERSION: If you don't feel like reading this all, let me put it in a few points-this game is absolutly fantastic-this game is not super popular (like maybe 20-60 players online at any given time)-it's unbeliveable that it's not more popular (It deserves it)-this game is perfect to me except for one thing - AI spams cheap units like there's no tomarrow-this game is free, give it a try, I'm not a big fan of RTS's but I liked this one Full Review I don't play too many RTS games and I'm not a big fan of competitve gameplay, but I found myself enjoying the game as I was facing against friends who I thought would of easily beat me. I feel as though that playing as combine has a slight advantage because you don't need to send people to get scrap, instead you build power generators. But hey, it the Half-life universe, it makes sense that the rebals are at a disatvantage, after all, the Combine made the human race surrender after a 6-7hour war. (I forget if it's 6 or if it's 7)STORY TIME:It was Me + Easy AI against a friend + his brother, we were all playing as rebals.The match lasted a good 3 hours because most of the time we were locked in a stalemate.Everytime I attacked with a wave of units, they'd get destroyed, the same would happen to him.After a good bit of thinking and planning, I was able to take back the center point, which led the way for my CPU ally to charge the enemy base. One of the enemies had built a 2nd base in the very top, he was surrounded, my CPU ally charged with what was left of his attack on enemy base and I charged with almost every unit I had, almost all the units went through the back (where there were no defenses) and we annihlated him. (now I see where that game mode got it's name from! XD)This game is free and it's pretty dang good, I see no reason NOT to try it.SO GO DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! XDEDIT (Part of Review): After owning this game for quite some time (not playing it as much as other games thou) I have to say that just about everything is perfect, voices, animation, gameplay, the whole sha-bang..... BUT....... There is one thing, JUST ONE THING that annoys me in this game (besides it not being popular) and it's VERY annoying.......The thing is, requesition (I think I spelled that right) is far easier to get than scrap (power is still pretty easy on combine side) and this leads to the AI spamming MASSIVE amounts of ""low-power"" units like simple soldiers, metro cops, or partisans........ This creates a LOT of lag and a bit less fun.....But hey, they added achievments! XD			"

												One of the best games I've ever playedIt's a simple RTS, with the graphics and units from HL2It has simple mechanics, allowing even those new to RTS games to learn within an hourOnly thing is that it lacks Combine singleplayer missions really, but its a beautiful game10/10			"

												English:This game is very good. There is 4 mode to play. Defend your base against zombies/combine/antlions for all costs or attack and eliminate your multiplayer/cpu controlled enemy. Be combine or rebels side. Each race has own tactics, weapons, buildings and models. Combines has very high technology. Has very aggresive attacking units. But less powerful when defending somewhere. Rebels has very defensive units. Veteran soldiers are anti armor, anti special ops. But not an attacker. They must stay ground and crouch for the aiming for hit the enemies. They can't fight while mobile. They must stabilize the aim and shot. Rebels has very cons at the charge. You can't race the Combine's attacking power with Rebel's attacking power while charging.Türkçe:Oyun çok güzel. Oyunda oynayabileceğiniz 4 mod bulunuyor. Ya base'inizi Zombilere/Combine'lara ya da antlionlara karşı savunun ya da multiplayer/singleplayer'da düşmanlarınızı bozguna uğratın. Oyunda ya İsyancı insanların tarafını ya da Combine'ları seçiyorsunuz.Her bir ırk kendine has silahlara, inşaalara,taktiklere ve modellere sahip. Mesela Combine'ların teknolojileri çok iyi. Aşırı derecede saldırgan birimleri var. Ama savundukları zaman bu güçlerinden eser kalmıyor.İsyancılar ise tam tersine, çok iyi savunma güçleri var.Uzman askerler adeta zırhları deşmek ve özel birimleri yok etmek için varlar. Lakin saldırmada etkisiz elemanlar. Çünkü oldukları yerde çömelip iki saat nişan almaları gerekli.Hareket ederken savaşamıyorlar. Çünkü eğilip nişan almaları ve daha sonra da ateş etmeleri gerekiyor. Kısacası saldırırken isyancıların bir sürü eksisi var. Combine'ların hücum ederkenki saldırı gücüyle isyancıların hücum ederkenki saldırı gücünü karşılaştıramazsınız.			"

												This game is incredible. Sandbox mode is by far the best feature, allowing you to spawn every single asset in the game, and allowing you to even assign them teams. Smooth, detailed models (Thanks, Source!) and a nice new take on the Half-Life universe. Overall, this is a very serious, very simple RTS with an awesome tutorial. Just be warned, this is meant for online play. Offline play is available with intelligent AI and 3 difficulties (Hard, is hard). Sandbox mode is something every RTS should have, as it keeps the game fresh. This game is free now, but I would gladly put money into it. Amazing devs, amazing game. 10/10DOWNLOAD NOW░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░█░░░█░█░▄▀░█▀▀░░░▀█▀░█░█░█░█▀▀░█░░░░█░░░█░░░█░█▀▄░░█▀▀░░░░█░░█▀█░█░▀▀█░▀░░░░▀░░░▀▀▀░▀░▀░░▀░▀▀▀░░░░▀░░▀░▀░▀░▀▀▀░▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▄░░░░░░░░░░░█░░█░░░░░░░░░░░█░░█░░░░░░░░░░█░░░█░░░░░░░░░█░░░░████████▄▄█░░░░░██████▄▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█▓▓▓▓▓▓█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█▓▓▓▓▓▓█████░░░░░░░░░███████▀░░░░▀▀██████▀			"

												This game is really, really fun.Assuming you can assrush it to 100 pop, you can make like 6 RPG rebels and then 4+ flamers and then just filler units like AR2 and SPAS 12 rebels and some medics and 7+ of the cheapest rebel unit, you can stomp everybody. Tore through a hard AI team's base with that strat.Or you could just be a ♥♥♥♥♥ and have your weakest units on turrets and a bunch of barricades and traps.Only complaints I have are that there isnt too much stuff to use (you got your vanilla SMG units, pistol units, shotguns, rifles, snipers (assuming you're combine) and OP♥♥♥♥♥antlions). What SHOULD be added is Vehicles. I WANT A COMBINE APC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT. Also, it lags whenever i'm at 100/100 population in a 3v3 or 4v4 match.8.5/10 otherwise.			"

Posted: December 16, 2015
												Great mod and better yet, better than a lot of RTS games out there. The mod is heavily based on Company of Heroes mechanics but if you're like me, then it's a welcome variation. It almost feels like Valve created a Half Life RTS game. The iconic source-engine physics are all there with bodies flying across the map and dragging on the pavement after they're hit by an explosion to manhacks bouncing off of enemy soldier's bodies. This game won't alienate you if you just want Half Life but with an RTS twist.The game lets you play with friends or with bots, like every RTS game SHOULD (I'm looking at you Men of War). You can play the classic game-modes such as Annihilation and Headquarters, but there's some fun variation with Overrun (survival) and Sandbox (spawn, build, whatever). This has very good variation for a mod. Considering that I've grown tired of RTS games since the release of anticipated titles such as Rome 2 Total War (huge let-down for me), I surprisingly had a lot of fun with this. Just playing Co-op zombie survival with friends makes this worth trying out.A BIG plus for me is the fact that this MOD (emphasis on MOD) has base building. Some of my favorite franchises with bigger budgets don't have this and have fallen from grace (DAWN OF WAR DAWN OF WAR DAWN OF WAR). If you have played Company of Heroes, then the resource collection in the game works exactly the same (capture flags, fortify them, etc). Base-building is also very similar except you can build ANYWHERE on the map. There is also a simple research system that is required to unlock certain units/weapons.Negatives: (mainly minor flaws)-The amount of content in terms of units and buildings is a little low (for controlled factions such as Rebels and Combine). There are quite a few more units but you can't control them (Antlions and Zombies). -The A.I. is also on the slow side. It pretty much travels in clusters with anywhere from 3 to 40 units travelling in a condensed pack (really hit my FPS if playing with more players). -This one may just be down to preference, but it felt odd that there were no vehicles considering that vehicles were a huge part of Half Life 2. Unless you count the Combine Strider (yes they're in the game) as a vehicle.-Some pathing issues (lost a game because half my units got stuck behind a turret I deployed lol).-Lack of permanent commands. I can click on ""Hold position"" to keep them from comitting suicide, but they CAN'T perform ANY actions afterwards or the ""Hold Position"" command gets thrown out the window and they proceed to then commit suicide as usual. There's really only ""Hold Position"", ""Attack Target"", and ""Patrol"".Other than that, the game is awesome. It has the Half Life 2 sounds. Common enemies such as the antlions and headcrabs return. Source physics. Very good adaption of Half Life 2 into an RTS game. Recommended you try it out!			"

												Okay, lets go from the top.I can't tell the units apart, especially with rebels.Cover is iffy. A shed may only provide one piece of cover while a rock might provide three.Resources are bad, because there are literally so many ways to get both of them that you will have a massive stockpile of them both midway through a match. Combat for the rebels is, at best, building a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of units and ""attack move""ing them to the enemy base. After that you're on your own because controlling any specific unit's in the mish mash of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that is YOUR  force is an exercise in both precision and unit identification, which as we previously determined, is impossible.Combat as the combine is headcrab bombardment. Period.THAT SAIDIt is a FREE total conversion MOD featuring ALL of the units of half life (which, if you're here, you love). What willl you be wasting? You're time?!Go play it you dink.			"

												Its a great game, ask the developers, they'll tell you all about me and how terrible i am (Seriously in one of the patch notes for the update on 31/05/15 in the misc section it reads (and i quote)):""Add fortification hint when capturing a control point the first time (game instructor option), added for PCreeper1"" (I'm PCreeper1 on their forums)But really, i don't have to say much, my videos can really do all the talking for me (find it yourself -_ -) but incase you don't wanna hear me rant on for days on a video about why i love this game, HERES THE TEXT VERSION!(Quick side note: This has both positive and negative sides, my review should not discourage you from getting this game because:A. Its free, so you're not exactly losing anything but timeB. This is simply my opinionBut if you still wanna listen to my review because you are skeptical about the game and don't know if its great, then as i said, it should not discourage you, but i understand)First of all, its half life 2, it doesn't get better than that really (unless you hate half life 2, then this isn't really the mod for you), The controls are- 'ok', i don't really know how to describe them really, the sides (rebels v. combine) are...I'm sorry, i can't say they are balanced, the rebels are simply too OP at the moment. The game is really relative to the half life universe, for example:The rebels don't have any... 'power units' of any kind, you have to collect scrap and build defences, build big armys of rebels and engineers, capture flags and eventually take down the scum of the enemy which is the combineFor the combine...its a different storyYes, they are very advance technology-wise, but that doesn't mean they are the strongest, a single strider can easily be wiped with just 5 - 10 RPG rebels, you have to build power generators eveywhere to place your buildings, i mean how else are they gonna get powered? THEY ARE ESSENTIAL!, Unlike the rebels, who can just build where-ever they want and have no hassle, the combine REQUIRE that power from the generators to get these buildings up. Yeah you get all the great things like mortar cannons, headcrab launchers, but those canisters will be destroyed within SECONDS by a mass rebel army, and the mortar cannons have a strict range of where they can fire.Overall, yes the combine seem like a good idea, but only if you're willing to go through a lot of wipeouts by rebels/other combine players/bots. But if you don't wanna be the rebels, i advise bots if you wanna go combine at first, i know they don't have the same feel as actual players, but trust me, these guys are getting smarter thanks to the developers, you really have to check those updates to know what i'm on about. and the rebels are just- well simply overpowered, i know this will change, its been a heated discussion about balancing since, well ever really.And on a final note, this game is great, the developers are active at all times and they are hearing, they want to know what you think can make this game good or bad (#StillPrayingForMedicsToNotHavePistols) and hell, if you're in the youtube business, GO RECORD VIDEOS FOR THIS! THEY HAVE A SUB-SECTION FOR VIDEOS!REVIEW FOR THIS GAME INVOLVING ^:

I always an RTS and Half-Life 2 combine. Now, my dream is fulfilled, I played it for hours, capturing points, building an army, using sandbox, competing against other people. It is a fun game, but it is bad when you get OP units like a strider. But usually the matches I play don't last very long. Overall, It's a really fun game. 8/10			"

												This game is a fantastic recreation of a classic RTS using the components of Half-Life 2, As a matter of fact It's better than most commercially developed RTS'.Most of it is well polished, great fun, and really fleshed out with plenty of maps full of detail and units all with their own special abillities that allows for the development of many strategies and counter-strategies.This game has given me and my friends plenty of hours of enjoyment, there's little to dislike but I do have some minor complaints.1. Games last 15 minutes, or 4 Hours.2. AI need to be smarter, 1 Vs 4 Hard AI is still too easy.3. Rebels units are overpowered compared to the Combine, however it levels out late game.4. RPG Spam is a thing and needs to not be.5. Destroys Friendships.Aside from those minor complaints, This game is definitely worth giving a try. It's consistently updated and fixed, and has tons of re-playability.			"

												I actually chanced upon this and I'm glad that I did. Certain mechanics are similar to Dawn of War, which works very well. It looks good, though a polish and more world detail wouldn't go amiss. All the models for the Combine and Resistance are there from HL2, as well as the sound effects.  My only gripe is that if playing offline, you cannot save your game, only see the campaign through or quit.A great free mod.7/10			"

VERY fun Half Life mod/game all around. Though honestly it does get a tad boring after a while. I used to LOVE playing this game in the background while listening to Sleepy Cast in my downtime for the month or so that I played it. While I haven't played Lambda Wars in quite a few months it's something I'll probably come back to. The only other issue I have with it aside from it getting a tad bit repetitive and boring after awhile (of playing) is the lack of actual players in the game. But that's not really an issue on the games behalf.			"

												Tired of being Gordon Freeman , hero of Half Life 2, not so talkative guy ? Well be a strategist and lead your army against the Combine scum! Or better still , be the combine and enslave hungry citizen to do your bidding! ( Not that kinda bidding... ) . This game remarks alot of games I've played . One of the BEST example is Company of Heroes . ( Seriously , if you don't know this game , you're not a RTS playa :c ) . Try once and never regret every second ingame! :) Trust me , I'm a royal GentlemanTill next time for my review . Stay "" CUPATEA! ""Gameplay- Not too bad , but if you're living in asia , Online gameplay tend to be glitchy cause of the ping- Creative game which require tactics to overcome enemy and overwhelm them to ? Rating of the game : 9.0 /10 I would say it needs additional units , it would be more fun but hey , that's every RTS-gamers dream :) New unit = New strategy :D(BLANITURE)Royal Gentleman of SiaRoyaliate			"

												Still in beta, so there's plenty of balance issues and glitches. It can get quite frustrating at times, especially with reoccuring but not consistant lag and framerate issues. A lot of people who host don't have the internet speed to be doing so.That being said, I really enjoy the game. It reminds me a lot of Starcraft mixed with Command and Conquer, but set in the Half Life universe. The units are well designed, though some do seem a bit unbalanced, as they can roll over an entire army with ease. There are of course ways to counter them, but it takes quite a while to figure out the proper strategy for countering specific units. There are several game modes to play, like Team matches, Free for all, and a survival mode.Not a perfect game by far, but it has a lot of potential, and what is there is quite good, if not a bit buggy at times.

												I love this game alot but it has some flaws that I think need to be focused on.#1 A.I.Ok I know this game is in beta and it's not made by a professional but the A.I. can be quite difficult to control. You send an engineer to repair some barricades but then he ignores that order and instead fights a strider with a pistol( Not good) plus you got the ai being wonky when it comes to getting to barricades. I sent a rebel squad of 3 to hold down a barricade and what do they do instead? Hide behind a rock or find ot her cover. I knew they could do hold it down so I manually sent them  in one by one. A definent issue that needs to be fixed right now is the manned turrets some times don't shoot at all wether it is overrun or any game they sometimes don't shoot.#2 TroopsI lose against the combine almost all the time because Im a rebel. I know the rebels have a teleporter and a scanner but I think their needs to be more rebel troops and balancing acts. For the combine the crab synth and mortar synth would be a great decisionOverall this game deserves an 8/10			"

												This game is really fun i love it its awesome to play against or with friends. It also got some friends who dont really play RTS games to try it out and they are having a blast as well. Its a really great feeling to win each skirmish, and to manage your troops. There are a few bugs here and there, maybe some balance issues, and the game has crashed on me multiple times. The game also really lags when there is too much happening on screen even for my friends PC which is a Core-i7 with 16 Gigs of DDR3 ram, and a nvidiaGTX 750Ti. Even then this game is still a blast. Its weird but everything just fits, and makes sense especially if you played Half-Life 2. I cannot reccomend this game enough even with all of its faults. If you are a fan of RTS games, or Half-life give this a try. Nothings more satifying then♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off by launching headcrabs into their base.			"

												Lamba wars is an amazing mod and provides a greate control system for the gameplay. It certainly unique for it's design being possibly being the only good free rts game out there. I personally like this since it brings me back memories of Halo Wars on the Xbox 360. Insted of the turn based factor that I saw most free rts games Lambda Wars does not have that feature and makes it feel like your actually preparing an army, or defending your base against a real threat to your troops.Pros:- gameplay- variety of units- freeCons:- the single player missions might be a little challenging for someone new to the rts genre- still in beta so expect bugsOverall: 4/5Amazing quality gameplay, especially for it being in beta and it feels like a standalone game all by itself. In addition it's free!			"

												This game is an okay game in singleplayer, but it really shines in multiplayer with friends (or soon to be enemies).There lie the possibilities to gang up with or against your friends, or to do a free-for-all and massacre everything.I wont talk about singleplayer because the AI is incredibly stupid and their only tactic is to swarm and throw people at the flesh grinder that is turret-wall.The game has all the makings of a pretty solid RTS; resource collection and management, troop production and commanding, and total-war tactics.Here are my pros and cons:PROS-Everything that makes an RTS great, and all the crap I listed aboveCONS-So many glitches. So many.-There are more glitches and bugs than I can list, but my worst two quams are a ""Join Game"" glitch, as my friends and I have labeled it. Basically about 2 out of 3 times when starting a multiplayer game from a lobby, the host will join the game, but everyone else will be left trying to click the join game button and will not be able to join the match. The second is a glitch that I'll list is a glitch where upon joining a game, the camera will be in an strictly vertical view, and the cursor will be nowhere to be found. There is no way to fix this that I have found other than surrendering the match and then relaunch.AI-The enemy AI is insanly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They will build and build until they cant fit anything more, and then they will SWARM you with units, whether it seems to work or not.-The troop AI is abismal. They will try to move in straight lines to their target and if they cant they will simply push obsacals away or be left jogging in place beside a wall. You can of course micro manage them all, but with a hundred of them it gets annoying really fast.Performance-The game runs at around 30 fps for me when a game starts, and when there are upwards of four-hundred troops onscreen, it drops to unplayable levels. At that point, you have to surrender and it sucks the match dry of fun. NOTE- My computer isn't the best out there, so the numbers will vary for other people.My rating for this game is around 6.5			"

												This game is an okay game in singleplayer, but it really shines in multiplayer with friends (or soon to be enemies).There lie the possibilities to gang up with or against your friends, or to do a free-for-all and massacre everything.I wont talk about singleplayer because the AI is incredibly stupid and their only tactic is to swarm and throw people at the flesh grinder that is turret-wall.The game has all the makings of a pretty solid RTS; resource collection and management, troop production and commanding, and total-war tactics.Here are my pros and cons:PROS-Everything that makes an RTS great, and all the crap I listed aboveCONS-So many glitches. So many.-There are more glitches and bugs than I can list, but my worst two quams are a ""Join Game"" glitch, as my friends and I have labeled it. Basically about 2 out of 3 times when starting a multiplayer game from a lobby, the host will join the game, but everyone else will be left trying to click the join game button and will not be able to join the match. The second is a glitch that I'll list is a glitch where upon joining a game, the camera will be in an strictly vertical view, and the cursor will be nowhere to be found. There is no way to fix this that I have found other than surrendering the match and then relaunch.AI-The enemy AI is insanly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They will build and build until they cant fit anything more, and then they will SWARM you with units, whether it seems to work or not.-The troop AI is abismal. They will try to move in straight lines to their target and if they cant they will simply push obsacals away or be left jogging in place beside a wall. You can of course micro manage them all, but with a hundred of them it gets annoying really fast.Performance-The game runs at around 30 fps for me when a game starts, and when there are upwards of four-hundred troops onscreen, it drops to unplayable levels. At that point, you have to surrender and it sucks the match dry of fun. NOTE- My computer isn't the best out there, so the numbers will vary for other people.My rating for this game is around 6.5			"

												I love this game alot but it has some flaws that I think need to be focused on.#1 A.I.Ok I know this game is in beta and it's not made by a professional but the A.I. can be quite difficult to control. You send an engineer to repair some barricades but then he ignores that order and instead fights a strider with a pistol( Not good) plus you got the ai being wonky when it comes to getting to barricades. I sent a rebel squad of 3 to hold down a barricade and what do they do instead? Hide behind a rock or find ot her cover. I knew they could do hold it down so I manually sent them  in one by one. A definent issue that needs to be fixed right now is the manned turrets some times don't shoot at all wether it is overrun or any game they sometimes don't shoot.#2 TroopsI lose against the combine almost all the time because Im a rebel. I know the rebels have a teleporter and a scanner but I think their needs to be more rebel troops and balancing acts. For the combine the crab synth and mortar synth would be a great decisionOverall this game deserves an 8/10			"

												Still in beta, so there's plenty of balance issues and glitches. It can get quite frustrating at times, especially with reoccuring but not consistant lag and framerate issues. A lot of people who host don't have the internet speed to be doing so.That being said, I really enjoy the game. It reminds me a lot of Starcraft mixed with Command and Conquer, but set in the Half Life universe. The units are well designed, though some do seem a bit unbalanced, as they can roll over an entire army with ease. There are of course ways to counter them, but it takes quite a while to figure out the proper strategy for countering specific units. There are several game modes to play, like Team matches, Free for all, and a survival mode.Not a perfect game by far, but it has a lot of potential, and what is there is quite good, if not a bit buggy at times.

												I'm a few hours in, and it seems solid.Now, I don't know how it holds up with HL2 lore, (I'm not a geek, bite me) but I can definetly say that the engine is stable and functional, which is an accomplishment in its own right. That said it has some minor issues, but given the beta state, they may be overlooked... But may need fixing.But before we get to that, let me talk about the things I liked. First of all, the engine is still a bit... Gmodish which means stuff's gonna fly all over the place. Building debrees, unit corpses, random junk, all sorts of stuff. Even units - at one point in sp_abandoned a fast zombie lunged at one of my units and went skydiving after it bounced off a pile of garbage. Things like this keep the game _slightly_ unpredictible which makes it a little more fun, as there's a slight chance that 2 setups will have different results. I see it as a merit, even though some may see it as a flaw.Another thing I like is the fact that in order to do damage, you actually have to hit the enemy units. For example if a Shotgun Rebel will try to turn around and pump a combine full of lead, he may miss. Why? Because he fired before he finished turning around. It may not seem all that afir but honestly, I kinda see where the creators are coming from. This also means that shotguns won't just do fixed damage at a short range, but instead can be used as a strong short distance weapon and a weak mid-range weapon. Kudos.I also like that you don't have to build your buildings to a grid. Even though I think it should be an option, it'd be best if it was an OPTION. Aka, you can both snap to grid and freeplace them. Rotating buildings would also be a welcome feature, in case I missed it, and it would allow for some creative base construction. At the very least allow the structures to be rotated 90 degrees.What I don't like is the text-based, minimalistic interface, but again, it's a Beta. Their priority should be making the game functional and balanced before they hone the visuals.Also while I understand the whole ""shortcut corresponds to icon placement"" concept, I found it very, very, very, very counter-intuitive, especially after Blizzard's rise to power and their use of contextual naming of the shortcuts - A for Attack, also for Offensive Movement, B for building, S for stopping (oh also, you don't have a ""STOP"" command. There's only a""HOLD GROUND"") I went out of my way to re-bind those just so I can more or less normally play with what I'm used to since childhood. That said, I can see the merits of such control scheme, but it's simply not what I like.Another gripe I have with this game is a pretty serious issue, especially on maps like sp_abandoned. INTERACTIVE OBJECTS (such as weapon crates, fruit and other) WILL GO INVISIBLE IF THE CAMERA'S FAR OUT ENOUGH. While I admit that it's fair to include this feature, someone should make sure that THE FADING DOESN'T OCCUR WHEN THE CAMERA IS ZOOMED OUT TO THE MAX! Why? Well duh, otherwise how are you gonna see the crates? And in strategy games, the bigger your field of view is, the better. Imagine if you had to play Starcraft or Red Alert using a camera that only allows you to see one tile at a time! Granted, zooming in one step is enough to make the objects visible, but that means you either have to spend the entire game on a reduced screen, or randomly zoom in back and forth like a toddler with a camcorder just to check the objects for being present.Another thing, again having something to do with sp_abandoned. As you may accidentally find out, the various gas cans and carnisters EXPLODE!!!!!111!!1!!1i1!1oneoneone! That's fine, I'll just order my troops to shoot them so they're not a threa- *soldier wals onto the can, dies* Ooookaaay Maybe I'll blow them up with a grenade. *throws a grenade to get rid of 2 carnisters, aiming somewhere between them* Nothing? Maybe I didn't throw it close enough. *throws another one, aiming bullseye to blow it up, nothing* Well, those grenades are wasted. Greeeeeeeeaaat... I think the devs should make it possible to shoot those damn things, or at least make them grenadable. After all, they cost 10rq, might as well make them worth using, right?As I said, it's beta and needs polish. I hope that they'll at least include different cursors depending on what you're ordering your units to do. Right-clicking an enemy makes the same animation as telling them to walk on him, and they don't have an alternate response that would vocally differenciate their attacks from their movements.And I believe they included a custom music option... Which I haven't tried yet, but if it works, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!While not the perfect title, it's pretty good. If you can get past the 3 major problems, which are... bearable, you get a neat little mod that, if given some polishing and a campain editor, is probably gonna be a pretty solid title. In fact, I'm looking forward to seeing this come out as a full title. Perhaps the devs could use what they learned to make their own RTS in the future? I'd definetly buy that, if it's at least as solid as Lambda Wars.			"

Training Time: 12 SecondsFast Headcrabs - Fast versions of headcrabs. Same as the normal one, but makes the controlled unit fast. TT: 18 SPoison Headcrabs - Can kill enemies in one hit, but low health. TT: 21 SZombie - Refugees controlled by headcrabs. TT: 17 SFast Zombie - These poor people had their skin rot, causing the muscles to show. TT: 24 S Abilities: JumpPoison Zombie - Tough Zombie with 5 Poison Headcrabs on its body and head. Can throw Poison Headcrabs. Really tough but slow speed. TT: 40 S Abilities: Throw HeadcrabZombine - Combine Soldiers who were attacked by Headcrabs, they, too, pose a threat to the Resistance and the Combine. TT: 32 S Abilities: GrenadeResearchablesWeapons - Some zombies have a 20% chance to spawn with weapons. Explosives - Make zombies have explosives on their back. Great for destroying buildings.Intelligence - Zombies are smarter, they can now man turrets.Thats all my ideas for now. "

												At first, I had fallen to the bitter end of mass raiding enemy troops. Now that I have learnt the controls, I started to create garrisons as a combine and increased the number of stalkers. I thought that I needed something more. Something to make the game full.Then I found it. Garrisons were my source for tomato sauce on the battlefield. There were so many metro police that I decided that there was not enough. When I finally decided my troops were ready, I sent them out to my battlefield. At this stage I was getting 6 FPS.Even if it was lagging, I decided to push on. The enemies did not stand a chance.But then something else did not stand a chance against the plethora of metro police I had sent forth. The game itself. I found this amusing and for a mod for an RTS within the source engine, it was extremely well done.			"

												Even though Lambda Wars still has it's flaws (with the most obvious being the pathfinding) and the community is rather small from what I gather, it's a must-try for every Half-Life fan out there. This is a free Beta game, so there's nothing you can complain about for installing and playing it. Give it a try if you like real time strategy games, it has some great units and game modes and it's a nice and fun way to spend an evening with your friends if you can deal with some random glitches.

												Lambda Wars is a stand-alone Alien Swarm RTS mod but based around the lore of Half-Life 2. Very fun when you first play it, but limited unit types, two factions, and the fact that there is little to no strategy makes it get very boring really quick. Connection issues are out the♥♥♥♥♥(or at least for me and friends.) The AI are the stupidest I've seen in any RTS game. I have to recommend due to the fact that the developers definetly tried something new here, but improvements are coming and with the release of Source 2 they said they will be able to improve it even more			"

												Reviewed 12/23/14A very coherent and fun RTS that makes full use of the Half Life universe.Pros:+ IT'S FREE!!!!!+ Original soundtrack. Sounds like the original Half Life 2 soundtrack with hard-hitting guitar riffs mingled with technical shizwaz.+ Both factions play very differently and are viable. Rebels have strength in numbers and are a more direct smashmouth play style. Combine are best played by distributing the very powerful units on their own.+ Multiple maps that are a little direct but are well designed for the most part.+ Online and offline modes, plus a few designed ""campaign"" missions.Cons:- Semi-frequent bugs. It's a beta and a community made mod for Christ sake, though.- Units and UI can be a little finnicky and difficult to navigate sometimes. - AI is fairly easy to contend with, even on its hardest difficulty setting.- Some structures, particularly the defensive buildings, don't see much use, as a game can be won easily with fast unit mobilization.- (Personal preference) games don't usually extend for a particularly long time in my experience. No more than 10-20 minutes. From an RTS, I'd love to see an Age of Empires length game mode.- Only a couple songs in the soundtrack so far.Great tribute to Half Life in a completely new format. Enjoying kicking my friends' asses. I'd love to see a more feasible AI/campaign battle component in much larger, grander battles. Absolutely reccomend in its current state.			"

												I highly recommend this game, especially if you have friends to play it with. It really feels like you are looking over a giant (beautiful) overview of a Half-Life 2 map, while commanding troops at your disposal. Even if you aren't a big fan of RTS games, like me, this game is amazing. Every enemy and ally in Half-Life 2 is in this game, and all of them have a completely different strategy and also have a great purpose, no matter what stage you are in the game. You play as the Rebels and the Combine, and both are COMPLETELY different. The combine have very powerful, but very expensive troops like striders, hunters, snipers, ect., and the rebels have less expensive but less powerful troops like refugees, rebels, medics, ect.The rebels do have more powerful troops like flamers and people with rpgs, but you don't need to use those very much.The rebels and combine are different down to how they heal, how they get energy, what troops you use to build, and even down to what fortifications you make. Overall this is an amazing game, but as it is in beta, there are some major issues. Sometimes when you join a random public server, it bugs out and you aren't able to get in, but that is usually if you have over 200 ping. The AI pathfinding also needs a good amount of work too. They will sometimes get stuck in barricades, but usually only if they are very close together. The things it needs is just an easier way to delete buildings (instead of ordering troops to shoot at it by pressing z and clicking on the building), and just a little more balancing, but thats pretty much it for issues. Overall, this game is amazing, and I cant wait to see it in the full version.			"

												One of the best free games out there IMO. Since I played a lot of Starcraft 1 and Warcraft 3 this game was right up my alley; I had no problem carrying my skills over. The two races that you can pick from, Rebel and Combine, are designed great. They are a lot of fun to play aswell. Another great thing is how you can literally create your own strategys. I thought I was going to be undefeated in this game until another player rekted me by rushing income and metrocops. Needless to say my tech rush to rockets did NOT work.

Lambda Wars/Half-Life 2 Wars, is a cross between Dawn of War, and Half-Life 2. It combines them exceptionally well, and both sides have a taste for whichever you're accustomed to. The AI doesn't follow Pop-Cap which adds an amazingly hard challenge, but they always group up, so just research grenades ASAP and wait for their ♥♥♥♥ing onslaught.			"

												A very interesting RTS, a mix between Company of Heroes 2 and a little bit of Starcraft 2.The models in the game are for most part taken directly from Half-Life 2, it may cause confusion in distinguishing some units, principally with the Rebels, as they don't change too much from each other, when seen from above.Another problem would be the AI pathing, sometimes it works, sometimes it gets stuck with a clear path behind it. The theme kinda limits the amount of ""races"" that can be in the game, so there is only two, the combines and the rebels, they play differently enough to say ""I prefer the rebels/combines more than the combines/rebels"".But overrall it's a great mod, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone, people that are not really into RTS won't have much problem getting into it as it's not that complicated, and people that already into RTS will enjoy it as a nice and simple game to pass the time, not a lot of depth, but certainly enough to entertain for a few hours, and a absolute must play for Half-Life fans.PS: Sorry for any grammatical errors.

												I've been playing since the third or fourth alpha release, and I can say, this is one of my favorite games of all time. Lambda Wars/Half-Life 2 Wars, is a cross between Dawn of War, and Half-Life 2. It combines them exceptionally well, and both sides have a taste for whichever you're accustomed to. The AI doesn't follow Pop-Cap which adds an amazingly hard challenge, but they always group up, so just research grenades ASAP and wait for their ♥♥♥♥ing onslaught.			"

												At first it was a bit confusing (I didn't realise at the time there was a tutorial in the ""Offline"" section) but it was pretty easy to get to grips with: with or without previous RTS experience.Highlights:The game runs smooth (in beta) and hasn't crashed or glitched/bugged to the point where I can't play,The missions are well designed and are to good quality for gameplay,Minor problems with the player units - walk into walls, needed to make a new route but nothing to be unexpected from a RTS game,The biggest issue was that there a currently only 3 missions to play (that I could see) and they are only for the rebels. Have alternate 'campaign' for the Combine and Rebels to add more missions for the player.How to improve:Add more missions and maps as they are made to great quality. Add the ability to create maps. Add the community workshop. Add more voices for units to add variation when ordering them to move etc.			"

												When this game still wasn't public on Steam I saw it and it looked amazing well since then I'd forgotten about it. But recently I saw I could play it, I was SO happy even more happy to see it was free. I really wanted it to feel like Warcraft\Starcraft because I really love those games and I really love HL2 so if the 2 were put together I thought it'd be very fun, then I played it, it was EXTREAMLY fun, I've only been playing one days and got 8 hours of gameplay, me and my brother (we used to play Warcraft alot together) were playing constantly! If you enjoy Warcraft\Starcraft I really recommend this game, it does have the normal bugs that BETAs got but other than those this game is perfect!Even if you're new to these kind of games this is a very fun game and I still think you'd enjoy it, btw very fun to bring friends along!

												This game is probably one of the best RTS games that I have played in a while. It reminds me heavily of Halo Wars, which I was and still am a huge fan of, but in Lambda Wars, it's similar to Halo Wars but has more freedom. You can place your buildings almost anywhere you want, which is a step up from designated areas in other RTS games. The soundtrack is good but it only has a few songs. (Which get monotonous quite quickly.) There is also not much that you can do in the lobby before a game. i.e. kick players. There is also a bug that after a game, you pretty much have to recreate the lobby and invite everyone again. But the game is more good than bad, and I was surprised that I spent 2 hours on this in my first sitting. This game truely has potential, and I'm hoping that the devs can make this the game that it deserves to be.Pros:You can build anywhere2 unique factionsaddictive gameplayNice community (from what I've seen so far)GREAT maps (Best one is synth)Easy to Learn! Hard to Master!Cons:Limited game lobby commandsCombine snipers one-hit almost any unit (pls nerf. The first person who brings out snipers is the♥♥♥♥♥♥of the game)Only a few songs in the soundtrack (Why not add some original Half-Life OSTs?)Keep in mind that this game is only in beta, and it's already better than the fully developed CoD: AW that just came out also... Yeah. But what am I saying? Get the game and come join in on the fun!Overall, I give this game an 8/10 kernals. (This score will probably rise whenever updates are released.)			"

I was searching for an awesome RTS, while getting bored of W40K, and Army Men RTS. This game, is really awesome. The idea of having a HL2 universe RTS was in the air for a while i'd say, but actually having it and playing it was another thing. I am very pleased to congratulate the creators of Lambda Wars, to say that they have done an amazing job. Keep up the great work!  "

												Many nights have I enjoyed creating my army of infinite stalkers and going for an all out assult at the enemy, only problem was that once I got there, the game could not handle the amount of commands I threw at it and kicked the bucket. Brilliantly executed, and endlessly fun, this game not only utilises the extensive Half-Life universe but expands on in as well. The only downside is the lag or crashes due to overpopulation, but that is probably due the the source engine not designed for the rts genre. In all a great game for a megalomaniac with a temp for micromanagement. Keep up the good work devs.			"

												When I was just a young child of four/five years old, my father showed me how to play computer games. The first few games he showed me how to play were Carnivores, Star Wars: jedi knight academy, and Half-life.Half-life stuck with me as a favorite.I was around the age of eight or so when the second game came out, i believe. And i played it with much joy to my heart, and was completely blown away by the innovative and groundbreaking gameplay. (If you haven't played it, PLAY IT)And here I am now, seventeen years of age, and currently in love with Lambda wars (beta). This game isn't a shooter, but it is an extremely addicting and fun strategy game. But the real icing on the cake is that it's half-life.If you were a fan of the series, then i'm sure you'll get just as much pleasure as I did from manufacturing a few striders to patrol your metro-police infested base.I highly recommend this for any half-life fans.

												As of now, this is one of the best MODS that I have ever seen. To think this started as just a alien swarm mod turned standalone, this is truly as masterpeice. I would go over into every part/aspect of the game, but this is not a full review.Everything as of now is solid, but there are two complaints that hold this mod back from anything higher than a 8/10. First, the pathfinding is just unacceptable as of when this review was written, units get stuck on walls and I find my scrap collection lines getting stuck on every building I have. The next complaint is the Unit system itself, if you are going to have Cover It really shouldnt be single unit based (like in C&C), it should be squad based (like in CoH).(various walls and such provide cover in this game, reducing damage, though sometimes seems to make no sense as cover is not directional, rather static and even if someone is standing behind a wall but his back is totally exposed it still has the damage reduction even though said unit is totally exposed) These minor complaints are probably going to get fixed shortly, as the dev team is very open to the community.I would love to see valve indorse or at least support the devs of this mod, as this is just stunning. You can be promised to get hooked and spend hours on this game fighting random people who are also just as new to it as you.			"

												Lambada Wars is a really cool concept. The game takes the Half-Life Theme and puts it in an RTS environment. The user interface and gameplay reminds me quite a bit of the Dawn Of War series, and I really like that! The gameplay is solid, and everything seems pretty balanced. The game looks decent as well. It is a little rough around the edges in some places. But overall I have to say Lambada Wars is one of the best free to play RTS games I have ever played. That being said however I should note its not often I see f2p RTS games. So I may not be the most experienced in that department. Lambada Wars is free on Steam right now, you should try it!			"

I would give it a 7/10.I know some people have a very short attention span, so i'll try to wrap this up quick:Pros: Very friendly community (if you happen to run into another player) Very satisfying when you zerg rush your enemies base. Variety of gamemodes. Very fun to play with friends. You have to be VERY strategical with your defenses, otherwise you'll get stormed over. Very fun as it requires you to think very hard before placing down turrets.Cons: Very buggy. Nearly dead community. Very little unit dialog. Some units, buildings, and abilities were not in the game. (Riot Shields for metropolice, laser mortars for combine, etc) "

												• Gameplay is GREAT, although it still needs some balancing, each faction has a different style of playing, but here's what makes this game a bit more unique.Casualties = bad.• Music isn't really great, at least not the old ones, since they don't really 'remind' me of hl2 music.• Atmosphere is not so hot either, at least not for the Combine faction.• Design and appearance is what I'm going to talk about the most, it needs a little more effort put into it, especially for the Combine faction. They don't look like the Combine's usual structures (this is hard to pull off since the Combine actually didn't have any buildings in the real game since most of them were human buildings outfitted with Combine technology).I.e. this gameplay is great, looks, music, and atmosphere are not so great.You should probably rate this review funny.

There are still bugs, not a lot of missions(all of them as rebels).Anyway, don't forget it's still a beta.

												Hang on, did you actually have to check the reviews on this game?Oh boy, you must be stupid (jk no hate). Alright, at the time of this review, I've played the game not very extensively. But I can tell you this: It is a great game. It's a free game. Lambda Wars can be played in different ways. My personal favorite way is co oping it with a friend, it makes it easier and more enjoyable. You can also play it solo against bots or other players, or you can find some random person/people online to play with! Every one of those ways are extremely fun. This game is extremely fun. This game is 100% free. It's an amazing game, graphically, game-mechanics wise, teamwork wise, etc. Just try it!EDIT:A day or two after I posted this, one of the devs commented on it. After seeing this comment, and many others on reviews, artwork, and all of that, I can conclude that even the devs for this game are awesome. Constantly being active and kind, just generally talking and being kind towards the community. Thanks devs!			"

												Pretty nice strategy game that gives a couple of hours of fun before it gets repetitive, but mind you, those two hours will be epic. The game has reached that point in development where you are almost guaranteed no new content in updates, and instead only bug fixes, but honestly, I'm OK with that. There are a wide variety of units available to the three factions of the Half Life universe; the Rebels, Combine, and the Antlions. One faction in particular is rediculously overpowered, which forces multiplayer hosts to make players all play the same faction.Besides the imbalanced units, the game is nice. The textures and models are the exact same as the ones in the original Half Life games, so don't expect any ""next-gen"" graphics or anything groundbreaking like that. Overall, gameplay is fun, but gets dry and repetitive a few hours in. I really want to give this game a higher score, but considering the combination of nasty GUI and balance issues, as well as a semi-broken singleplayer, I can't give it anything higher than a 6/10.

												After a few hours of playing, this game is really... meh.The strategy that everyone uses is pretty much train 100 basic units and rush their base. Even the bots use this! but with the bots you have no time to prepare. Its like they're training time is from 40 bloody seconds to 4. But of course, because this game is incredibly easy you can set up about 5 turrets to kill an attack of 50. Speaking of bots, the difficulty levels are terrible. Easy: They litterally do nothing. At all. Normal: They gently attack you. Hard: HORDE MODE. Ive played this game last year, gave it a break and tried again today and nothing had changed, still found old bugs, no new maps, nothing. The only change I noticed was the background of the main menu. This game is pretty much dead, so dont play it unless you have friends to join you. Moving on: LAG. Not internet lag, framerate lag. This game tanks later on. Unlike other games like Starcraft or Supreme Commander, if theres 100 troops on the map I start to notice frame drops. The base of this games community seems to be kids, I mean, its a free game so children will inevitably flock it like birds with bread.I can already see fanboys rating this down because its a negative review.4/10.

												Tbh, I LOVE THIS GAME.  However, I cannot recommend a game that wastes so many opportunities to be more when the devs chain it to a lore chair that restricts so many amazing ideas from becoming reality.  From the limited amount of factions and maps (ONLY TWO FACTIONS?!) to only 1-3 gamemodes, with one being a total cluster♥♥♥♥ to play with when online (Overrun), Lambda Wars does what fans dream of in terms of a Half-Life 2 fan-game, but fails greatly to be something more than a lore-fan's wet dream.Half-Life is more than Half-Life 2 and, unfortunately, that mindset restricts the true potential of this game from blossoming.  It has the making of a great RTS game, with a mix of classic C&C base-building and combat with modern aspects of resource collection and territory control.  It's a great mix that succeeds to go beyond the classic RTS experience, but it's own concept holds the game back.  The lack of imagination here is TERRIFYING and really allows one faction to ♥♥♥♥ the other one over.  It's not really fair when the Combine has access to infantry-chewing units when the Rebels can ONLY BUILD INFANTRY (Excluding Dog).  The patch fixes help, but that can't help a Rebel player from getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by an army of massive walkers camping your base.  This game suffers from its own ultimate goal to stick to Half-Life 2 lore.  This needs to STOP.  LIKE, NOW.  I prefer the Rebels over the Combine because of their infantry, but I can't play this game as much knowing that the Combine EATS INFANTRY FOR BREAKFAST.  It makes matches extremely unenjoyable when you become the victim of walker♥♥♥♥♥♥.. NOT ENJOYABLE.If you're looking for two detailed factions, DON'T LOOK HERE.  There is no such thing as balance in Lambda Wars, especially when it comes to the Rebels and Combine factions... ALSO ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE THE ONLY TWO DAMN PLAYABLE FACTIONS.  The Combine are slow to start, but can become GODS when they get the ability to deploy walkers and heavy infantry.  The Rebels... not so much.  Their special ops infantry are USELESS in combat when walkers get deployed.  Even the RPG Troopers get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because of the fact that they are as weak as hell and this forces you to pick from the other weak infantry units, like the Rebel Veteran, who loads ever so slow after firing a one-hit-kill shot (two shots for heavy infantry).  The Rebel Flamer does nothing because the Combine keeps the Rebel FACTION far away, making shotguners and flamers completely useless.  The only real reason to use the flamer is if you somehow gain access to the enemy base after BASE-RUSHING him with cheap Rebel infantry units.  This game isn't all bad.  It's fun to play when you're not getting owned as the Rebels.  In fact, the fun factor is way up there if you play as the Combine because it's easier to win matches as the Combine.  Also, I don't know if you realize this, but damn is this game limited in options in terms of defense buildings and structures.  The Rebels have useless defense structures that are just a pain to use while the Combine just laugh at you while you attack their defenses.  I can't remember a single match while playing as the Rebels in a 1v1 match where I actually breached the Combine defenses... AT ALL.  The only way I could do if, if I could, would've been to ZERG RUSH THE BASE.  NO STRATEGY REQUIRED.  JUST THROW YOUR UNITS INTO THE ENEMY DEFENSES LIKE AN IDIOT.  Look... this game has so much potential, but it's wasted and restricted by this headache of a focus that is ""FOR THE LORE'S SAKE"".  Games kill themselves if they drown it in lore and only lore-specific stuff.  It needs more content, more imagination, more modes, more factions, more upgrades, more weapons, more units, more campaigns, more EVERYTHING.  It's still being developed, but it's still sad to see a game like this waste some potential that could've made this an easy download.  The devs ARE AMAZING PEOPLE and deserve positive feedback with what they've accomplished, but they need to realize that there's more potential in this game.  They're talent is spectacular and if only they realized the potential of this game, it could've been something more than Half-Life 2 as an RTS.  Look at Halo Wars, a spin-off in the Halo series.  It fit well into the lore while being INVENTIVE and CREATIVE with its units and factions.  Only two factions were featured, but there were uniqure units and upgrades for both of them, which had three commanders each faction with almost more than six or more unique units, upgrades and abilities.  If Lambda Wars wants to be an amazing game, it has to break the chains and expand itself to include a wealth of content that expands BOTH HL games.I wanted to recommend this game, but, unfortunately I can't when this game is drowning itself in its own lore, which is restricting the development of content that HL fans are wanting and are waiting for.  I'm sorry Vortal Storm, but Lambda Wars is not the game Half-Life fans want.  It's the game Half-Life 2 lore-nuts want and that alone does not make a great game even greater... it just drags it down and throws any big potential right out the window.BUT, IT'S NOT TOO LATE.  When you add more content and are more open to creativity and loads of content, I will be there as a Half-Life franchise fan.  But, until then... I'll just deal with the immense amount of disappointment that just consumed me after following this game since it's open beta on Steam.  I'll still play it, but, I am sorely disappointed and I hope that, someday, this game becomes something more than a Half-Life 2 lore orgy.			"

Year has passed, nothing has changed.Lambda Wars claims to be ""a traditional RTS game"", but does it play like one? No. Or maybe it plays like a really bad one.Now, look. The concept is great, the ideas are great, but they are nothing when around broken gameplay mechanics, which are, obviously, essential for a strategy game like Lambda Wars. And by gameplay mechanics I mean everything. The core problem is that the Combine and Rebels sides are heavily unbalanced. Early game eventually becomes a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when you are playing as the Combine, because: Buildings take a lot of time to build Units take a lot of time to train One Metrocop takes 16 Seconds! to train There's a unit limit cap, which prevents you both from attacking the enemy AND defending yourself from constant zerg rushes by Rebels. Expanding unit limits takes a lot of money. You can't effectively secure control points, especially in the early game, which slows down the gameplay, almost making you feel sorry for choosing Combine as your sideCombine everything listed above with the fact that this game is fast paced, which means you have to rush for resources and upgrades as soon as possible.Now, ""Rebels have weak units"". No. They don't.Core Rebel units aren't weak, at all. They sure are weaker than a Metrocop by 20 HP, but they are so much faster to be trained. Plus, they have a wide variety of weapons, while Metrocops haven't. ""Why are you comparing rebels to Metrocops and not Combine Soldiers? Combine Soldiers are stronger."" Because Combine Soldiers suffer from the same problems Metrocops do - they take too much time to train. And in comparsion to a Rebel unit, they are more expensive, have a slightly bigger HP Bar, which is nothing when you have 2-3 Rebels or even Partisans against one Combine Soldier, which will be the most frequent scene you'll see when playing the game. Combine Defenses aren't great. Manned Guns are easy to take down by already mentioned groups of Partisans/Rebels, because the pilot of the gun dies rather quick, despite the defense bonus provided by the barricade. Combine Turrets are vulnerable to Rebel Saboteurs and groups of rebels/partisans. Mines are pretty much useless against these huge crowds for some reason, I don't know why. Same for Headcrab shells.Devs had also added a completely useless variation of a Metrocop, which is supposed to be a mobile defense point or something, but I couldn't see it in action, Shield-wielding Cop died almost instantly from a bunch of rebels despite the raised shield and defense stance on.I could drone on and on about all the imbalances in the game, but everything above makes it pretty clear: the game is going the wrong direction. Completely. Developers should really take C&C Franchise as a proper example of a nice RTS game, and try to implement their ideas like defensive points and scrapyard thingies in a more C&C Setting.

												CLEARLY I am in the minority here but, here me out. The game is fun, overall, yes, buggy, but it's in Early Access so if I complain I get hate. Anyways, the problem lies within the factions the whole concept is greqat, I like the game, this is just me giving it straight. The factions, are not balanced, they are not. Rebels don't get vehicles, or all the tech, but, one problem is that the Vortigaunts are OP as ♥♥♥♥, and the rebels can just stew in their bases mating like rabbits and then swarm your base and destroy everything in seconds because there's a population cap for the Combine that you have to grow by getting the resource points. And I ♥♥♥♥ing HATE having to make ONE UNIT AT A TIME, OH MY GOD IT MAKES UNIT MANAGEMENT IMPOSSIBLE. I main the Combine, and there's no tutorial for them, it's just ""Hey, good luck understanding them!"" And when you play with bot teammates, they just build♥♥♥♥♥♥all over your base...the game is good, but the problem is imbalance in the ranks, the Rebels get partisan bonuses...Combine have vehicles and synths that are essentially just bigger Combine, fire power is weak, and what's the point of the Headcrab launcher if when you launch it in a swarm of Rebels it does nothing to them, and is the same as throwing a rock in the middle of 400 people all shooting at your flag and immediatly firing at any units you send, making it impossible to fight them. Again, the game is good, but these are just the problems I'VE been having...there's so much silliness and stuff for the Rebels and the Combine have tech that really does nothing. And units just stand and shoot at eachother. No moving around, finding cover, just line up and die.			"

												Cool concept, and I know it's not finished, but it does not appear to be going in the right direction.  It's been a long time since games like the original Command and Conquer where infantry simply run up to each other and shoot until one of them is dead, where everything is grossly disproportionate (buildings and vehicles being only slightly larger than the infantry), and the strategy consists of constructing a presposterous amount of units to overwhelm your enemy.  I think it's time somebody took a step forward, for once.			"

												Half Life 2 made into a mod, and a very succesful one in fact. You have 2 factions who are waging war, the Rebels and Combine for shorts, their real names are a bit longer. They're different in their own ways but I think both are fun to play. If you like Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War and Company of Heroes, this is a game for you, excellent FPS turned RTS mod, this is probably one of the few mods I'll be playing for a very long time, my congrats to the developers.

												Want to hear the sad part? I played this game for the first time somewhere around April, and I found it to be the work of a genius. Before going on with the review, there are some thing you should know about me. I love Half-Life, especially Half-Life 2. The game literally obssesed me. I finished the main game around 10 times and I spent countless hours reading all the possible pages on every possible Wiki about the game. I loved the world you were being immersed in.In April, this game was loyal to the Half-life 2 unniverse, in the best way it could. The units, the building, everything looked exactly how it looked in the main game. It gave you the same feeling. There was no difference in seeing a combine shoot a rebel in Half-life 2 or in Lambda wars. This aspect of the game changed since April. I no longer feel the same Half life universe around me when I am playing.The game feels buggier, even if it is 3 months later in development. I usualy play as the combine, so take note I will only talk about the changes suffered by the combine. I was very excited to see what ""vehicles"" were added in the game. Whatever. I start an offline match, classic one, 1v1, combine vs rebels, me playing as the combines. First thing I noticed was the metrocop at the garrison. The took out the classic one with the 9mm pistol, which was very loyal to the half life universe, and they added some kind of combine police with a riot shield. I like the innovation these guys are coming with, but I don't like the way they are straying away from the original game. I do not remember not even one metrocop coming at me with a riot shield + it adds unncesarry details in the game. Like ordering the metrocops to stand in a line... With no use at all. They can easily be shot standing like that. I liked having the classic metrocop with the pistol, and I could upgrade it with bigger weapons.I also saw a new ""vehicle"" factory. I was thinking that maybe they finally added the Combine APC, which could be a very important part in the game. In the original Half-Life 2 game, it was used by the metrocops to dispatch cops around the city. It could be used here to transport around 4-5 soldiers. Whatever. I built the vehicle factory, only to see the units you could build were the Manhacks, the rollermine, and scanners. The part with the scanners is very wrong. In april, the Scanners were build at the citadel, as it was in the original game. Why change the way it was? Why build them at the vehicle factory? No sense... Manhacks, same thing. In the original game, they were deployed by the metrocops... now you can build them at the vehicle factory?!! Wtf?! no sense again... The engine of the Scanners was modified, they no longer float realistically, they now move with no accelaration whatsoever. No new buildings, except a generator for the Combine, which  takes energy from scraps. Again, a negative point. At least in April, the scrapt was something unique for the rebels, a team already with less content than the combine. Now the combine has access to scraps too...If at least we would have vehicles...			"

												The rebels enjoy a massive bias from the developers, while the combine are a joke that only mildly improve come the late game, which is usually long after the rebels have drowned them in waves of units. The interface is clunky, and every order you give your units needs to be micro managed thanks to abysmal pathfinding, which makes a habit of exploiting mapping oversights to move into places they shouldn't be able to get to, or waltz straight through enemy territory to get to a place directly behind themselves. I'd like to say it's improving, but this has been the status quo from before the mod was even on steam, and despite continued updates it seems to be continuing along that path.[EDIT]As of recent updates, the rebels have recently been given access to dog units. 'OP AS ♥♥♥♥' does not even begin to describe them.			"

												I can't recomend the game now due to a few flaws, but it is still in beta so perhaps they will be fixed. The main problem is that it is way too easy. The AI sucks becuase it doesn't do much of anything for the first few minutes. You can easily rush them with tier 1 units and they will put up no resistance, even on hard. The game is also way too slow for my tastes. Think about how slow Age of Mythology is, if you've ever played it. The gameplay needs a dramatic speed boost. Perhaps boosting the resource income would help. I don't like the capture mechanic (you basically have to hold capture points to get resources). It doesn't feel like an RTS. All the units are pretty bland and there isn't enough variety. It's just pretty much soldiers with different types of weapons. There are no vehices or air units, just infantry. I remember half life 2 having helicopters, tanks, cars, airboats, etc. There are only two factions. I feel like there is plenty of room in the Half-Life lore for there to be a thrid race. Perhaps zombies, antlions, or just creatures from xen? Finally, the combine race needs a tutorial. I still don't know how to get more population with them.			"

												Let me start by saying that this is a fantastic game in its own right, the dev took an FPS and transformed it into a working RTS game. It's a nice take on the Half Life series and it incorporates the lore pretty well.Despite that I can't really recommend this game.I found it rather boring, to be completely honest. Despite being a unique take on Half Life, I felt like I was replaying some of the RTS games I've picked up in the past, like Command and Conquer. The mechanics aren't that unique (not at all, really), the gameplay is very typical for an RTS, and it just felt like...I don't know, the game was lacking. I played the tutorial and some quick matches and got bored really quickly. A friend talked me into playing it on his gaming rig thinking that it was my lower-end PC that ruined it for me...and even after a few hours I still just found it monotonous and boring.The concept is pretty nice, and the execution is good, but the actual result is just your average RTS game with the HL2 logo on it. Nothing new or exciting, I'm sorry to say.			"

												Well to start off with. this game is very flawed, Its very stuffy and hard to work with when it comes to the interface and menu. its fairly simple to understand when it comes to the gameplay but there are some issues like units glitching through walls and enemy's not dying. I only played for a few minutes and already I dont like this game. but its free and early access so eh, I dont reccomend this game to half-life fans because this isnt half life. just a reskin of some other RTS games with a crapy interfaceHope this review helped you decide whether to download this.

												The backround story of Half-Life 2 lends itself perfectly for a strategy game, and for taking on that task i can only praise Vortal Storm.Unfortunately as soon as i started playing the first flaws this title has started to dawn on me. There are quite a few strange design choices made here and there and not a lot is explained about them. Giant bottles of beer that blur your vision when touched? Doesn't match up all that well with the franchise now does it? It clearly shows the fine line of where the content from the Half-Life universe ends and the  ideas of the developer begin.Next to that there are still a lot of little problems and glitches plaguing Lamda Wars. Enemies and allies alike getting stuck behind corners and obstacles, units going straight through instead of around placed barricades and having a tough time doing so often getting stuck behind them, getting soldiers in to cover can be a pain as well , medics and engineers who are placed in the back well behind barricades and turrets to support the soldiers and structures placed there often run straight passed them in to incoming enemies and die, and the list goes on. Al these little things together can be frustrating and it makes me curse at my little army of idiots out of annoyance.Don't get me wrong, there is definitely something here but it needs a lot more work and fine-tuning before i can fully recommend it to anyone. Big fans of the franchise might not care because that part of the game is pretty solid, it has been since 2004 and it still is. But people that are purely looking for a solid RTS might be disappointed.On the other hand it is free so there is no harm in giving it a try yourself.[ I am aware of the fact that this mod is still in Beta so i will come back to this later for another look and hopefully by then i can honestly recommend it to others. ]			"

												As someone who is a fan of RTS, I would say this is a very one dimensional RTS game without a lot of depth. It seems to have been inspired by Company of Heroes and early Command and Conquer. Defense is far more powerful than a good offense. If you enjoy the Half-Life Universe, than this may be the game for you, because it's the only way anyone could enjoy it. It's basically an infantry war game, without vehicles.			"

												Well.... I got what I paid for. This was thoroughly uninspired and underwhelming.But, I do have a few praises to sing:The interface and camera controls are fairly similar to Starcraft, and that makes it at least pleasurable to play. I didn't fight the interface too much.It's relatively easy to tell what is what. At least it didn't look cluttered and overly complex, and the graphics are actually fine for an RTS. It's source though, so not a huge surprise there.And... that's about all it has going for it.The economic design is fairly lackluster. There are resources, but it takes minimal effort to get them, so you really can get a fully saturated economy going quite quickly. This leads to problem 2: Macro is BORING. There's just not much to do, and there's no flood of resources feeling that you get from say, 5 base Zerg in Starcraft Broodwar.Okay, not every game has to be simcity on steroids, but what about the tactics? Well, they're boring too. Infantry are fairly identical, and so early game play is just boring and 1 dimensional. Units beyond that might be somewhat interesting, but given how limited the economy is, you can't make many of them. And to make matters even worse, there's barely any tech tree at all.Overall, it feels like I'm not architecting any grand strategies, employing finessed micro, or exploiting the terrain and tactical advantages to win a match. I just feel like I'm doing the most basic routine and pressing attack-move and going to sleep. I don't feel engaged. I don't have fun using the units. I don't like the game.Bah, what did I expect?But, maybe if these guys got a real designer to sit down and actually architect a meaningful game flow, it'd be pretty good. I mean, they put all this effort into building a fairly decent RTS client for the source engine. That's kind of awesome.Until then, I'll be uninstalling.			"

I wish that there were more people that play this game so that me and my friends can go against another group of peoples friends. Unfortunatly there is still work that must be done. Me and my friends had to set up honor rules when some strats ended up being too OP even on competetive mode. But the game still updates and balanced and we are always looking forward to that. Defenitly worth a try if you have some friends who also appreciate RTS's/HL2 (has single player missions too, that are relativly hard).			"

												Very good game, it's not full of content, but it's definitly fun, addicting and exciting, the gameplay feels nice, it has awesome combat and the graphics are great, and straight up remind you of Half-Life 2. If I were to place a price on this game, it would be around 10 bucks. It only has a few problems, first, there is no way to demolish buildings or destroy troops, second, no vehicles, well, maybe Dog, but aside from him none, and third, if you accidentaly press the windows button and try to get back in the game, it will crash, fourth, In AI Skirmish maps you, and your enemies, bases spawn side-to-side, fifth, there's a population cap of a 100. Overall this game gets an 8.2/10. Recommend it.TL,DR: Very nice game, it's fun, it few minor limitations and it's a 8.2/10			"

												First off i'd like to say that im a huge fan of RTS games (Red Alert, Tiberium Sun etc...) so i was getting a little nostalgic thinking about those games but was low on cash so i got lambda wars it was confusing and even buggy at first but after a little while of playing (30 min) you work past its flaws. id say Its probably the best Free RTS on steam, another good thing about this game is that it is constantly updated with new maps features and units even if you have the slightest inclination of enjoyment toward the RTS genre i reccomend you give this game a try.But with all that said i must point out one of the most glaring issues: While the community is very positive and nontoxic it is tiny ive only ever seen a max of 30 players online after its initial release. I do not beleive this game gets the full recognition it deserves.			"

												An interesting take on the Half-Life universe, but is plagued with a number of bugs, a clunky interface, stupid AI, and unintuitive gameplay.The gameplay is extremely dull and plays like almost every other RTS on the market. It's heavily comparable to Age of Empires. It doesn't feel fresh and engaging.The AI acts like a generic RTS soldier with no unique features. I expected the AI to carry some of the abillities of Half-Life 2's AI, like running around for cover instead of taking all the shots to the face.The interface is pretty good for a mod, but there's a few issues. For one, the camera does not zoom out far enough. I should be able to see the entire map by zooming out, ala Supreme Comander. There are a lot of HUD elements that shouldn't be around until after you discover the required tech, however it's probably a priority.Overall, the concept is great, but I don't recommend it for anyone looking for a fresh RTS set in the Half-Life universe. What I've seen so far is a bland, generic RTS with Half-Life elements.			"

												Update 1: 11/13/15, After playing another 30 minutes and reading some of the developers comments that he posted on this review, I've come to the consensus that most of my cons are just me ♥♥♥♥♥ing. I have made adjustments to this and have made adjustments, enjoy!Pros:~ Creative maps~ Interesting Weather effects (Snow Tornadoes, Rain, etc)~ Easy Macro, Micro trainer~ Without AI on multiplayer it is a really good game~ Good Animations~ Excellent Textures~ Easy resource grabbing~ 4 races in game (3 that you can play, Combine, Rebel, Antlions. And 1 solitary Zombie AI) (Poor zombies D: )~ Resource balancing is a lot better now that I have started~ Fun game modes~ RPers in some of the matches make things more fun because everyone (sometimes) desides to join in on it and drag it out and make things more funNeutral: ~ Small community but its good enough for a game like thisCons:~ When creating games they tend to glitch out and you can't join them even when it says you can (Hence the ""Join Game Glitch"" that I have learned to call it)~ Some Lag issues on certain maps~ Camera glitches at timesAll things considered when you take out my general ♥♥♥♥♥yness, 9/10 is what I would rate this. Sorry for my ♥♥♥♥♥yness before the 1st update, I was a bit..unprofessional about it. It has a lot of potential and the developers need to keep on it for they are good at what they do with this.Godspeed~Dark Messiah			"

												Game is good that deserves some loving and needs players!The good:Gameplay: cant really judge but its good you got 3 factions to chose either combine, rebels and antilition and maybe chose your color but once you hit into the game you are gonna start constructing bases or attacking.Game Modes: some of them are good you might like once you try this game out!Offline campagin: its good but requires training.The Bad:Needs players!: Rts genre isnt really popular but Starcraft is one of the popular ones out there still but this needs players theres usally like 3 or 4 lobbys open and theres usally like 400-600 players playing but this game just needs it...Community: I know all units have counters but everyone seems to complain the everything is op well the rebels are currently but like always people tend to complain or whine.Recommend to game for you to try if you are into rts games or your looking for a free to play mod of Alien swarm/HL2 this game is for you! go smash that download button!

												NOTE TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO MAKE A SERVER:You must port-forward your router with port 27015Otherwise ur lobby will create a local server and noone will be able to join it!Otherwise:-UI is great-Models and sounds are very well fitted into a seemingly different game! -The teams are well balanced but striders are a pain. Maybe make their cannon use 200 power and their train time more. -the music in fantastic!But there are some bugs and unwanted things:-the game is very unoptimized. I have a gtx 650 Ti and the game runs at 11-3 fps after about an 30 mins of an online game! Please optimize-The pathfinding is awful. Please fixAnd some requests:-Add more factions (Antlions?)(XEN?)-Add more units-Add more maps-Fix everything stated above-TELL EVERYONE THAT YOU NEED TO FORWARD 27015-make feature to not allow certain buildings/units in a game(Skimrish/Online)But the game is still in beta and im putting my hopes on it!

It is recomended you get this game.However there some bad glitches includeing a game breaking glitch that does not let beat the match. the glitch is in the map or_trapped i think that is the name. that map is really fun but ever time i played it i ran many glitches. Included the glitch where some of the enemys get stuck and you cant kill. Not letting you beating. I still recommend this game because its still in beta and those glitches will most likely fixed.

												Good game with flaws that ♥♥♥♥ the whole game up. one of the flaws is when you order a army or even single soldiers. any enemy units encountered along the way just get ignored and you always end up losing mass armies to one less than half of yours size. another thing i hate is how quickley the AI progresses before you can even afford a small squad they always have a army coming your way. overall the game it's good fun but there are too many things that turn half the game into a chore. if there was a yes and no button i would be clicking it, this is still early in development so lets just say they are on the right road.

 A great RTS for a beta. Lambda Wars is a beta RTS that is set in the Half Life 2 Universe, exactly my cup of tea. This is probably one of the best betas i've ever played.

												It's a really good game/mod. I love the absolute style of of it, and the combine is of course my favorite faction (but thats just my opinion). It is really amazing how the creator(s) balanced each faction like. while the rebels are fine to build anywhere they want to, the combine have to stay near their power genoraters. Even though the combine are generally stronger overall(have more health, better range of weapons ect...), the rebels have a lot more manuverability. The only thing I would like them to fix in this update is the rebel's veteran unit and the combine's sniper unit. Both unit can't hit anything in a fight despite rebels being ""vetarans"" or snipers using ""marksman shot"" if they don't even hit there target once.			"

												I quite enjoyed lambda wars. It's a excellent RTS made off of one of my favourite games. I enjoy both sides quality, and they're decently balanced (But I do think one side is stronger than the other.) I like the single player missions, fighting in multiplayer. I like finding new strategies to destroy enemies, I eventually got to the point where I started to screenshot and study maps. Man, I guess I can get into this game.. I don't like certain things about it though; a few headcrab pods at the start of the game can destroy the enemy, It can be hard to identify different troops from each other as a rebel. But other then that, I would definitely recommend getting this game. Best part of all the game is free.			"

												It's a half-Life RTS!As a fan of the Half Life Series and a lover of RTS games, i can say that the fact this even exists is Amazing, and great that it does too, for i am ever happy to have found it.I can't even tell this is a mod when playing it, because it feels and looks like its own full stand-alone game, from how well its been done and put together, and it very well may be it's own game in the future, if it gets enough support and attention.. It's a very well done half-Life RTS done in a very Command and Conquer like-style.I'd Recommend this game/mod if you like either Titles, or both for that matter..and especially if you like the RTS Genre.

												This is a superb mod. No joke. I am really impressed by the job the modder(s) have done with this. It is something most of  us didn't even know we wanted, and it is really fun. However, there are some things that should be changed/ added. I think maybe the devs should work a bit more on the AI, as they only seem to know 1 thing; Zerg rush with Partisans. Just add a difficulty setting on them. Also, YES, I KNOW PROGRAMMING IS VERY DIFFICULT. ESPECIALLY WITH AI, but this is one of the only really big problems I see, which brings me onto my next topic. The power system the combine use should either be nerfed, given to the rebels as well, scrapped all together (which I don't want because frankly, it's really cool), or the rebels should be given something just as powerful and fun to do. Wasting engineers to gather scrap? Not fun. Hell, maybe give the rebels a power to somehow convert Metro Police and Loyalist Citizens with a certain type of propaganda trap. I don't care what you do really, just have fun and make it fun!			"

												     Since the game is still in Beta, I can't write a legitamite review untill the game is fully realeased. However I can write about some things that I enjoy about the game and things I think need to be revised. First off I love the idea of a Half Life RTS game and I think they should keep developing it. The maps are interesting and, for the most part, pretty expansive and it's fun to send your units out take controll of the area. The UI is simple but can get a little bit confusing the first time around.      Some things I think need fixed are: Rebel antlions are over-powerd and will destroy everything in their paths. The camera needs to be able to zoom in and out more. The combine needs less preparation required to build things and units need to cost less if the max units is only 100. Units should be more manageable and esier to distinguish.(Suggestion: make it possible to hotkey selected groups of units to jump quikly to them.) And lastly, make the victory and defete screens less awefull looking.      Overall the game is good and I recomend it to people who like the Half Life series, but I cannot say I recomend it to seasoned RTS players. Especialy in its current state.			"

Very fun with friends but it seriously needs to get a few major connection issues and UI issues patched ASAP.			"

												Good game, and it's free at that. Really fun to play if you like RTS games; although this isn't a typical RTS game. The Micro managing can be really really weird, and requires a lot of effort to pull off. Rebels seem to be the easiest to play as, if only because of the fact that you can build a ton of units fast then rush the enemy with sheer force alone. Not much micro managing there.I find the combine harder to play as. The starting units are costy, but it's pretty easy to turtle as combine while you upgrade your tech and send in a few striders.What you need to know is that it's a fun game and it's free. If you have the hard drive space I'd get it and try it.What I'd like to see from this game in the future is maybe the ability to build vehicles like the combine APC and the Jeep/Airboat, both with and without weapons. Wouldn't be hard to do. Definitely needs more units and buildings to build. Devs need to add thsi stuff so the game matches last longer. What happens now is after 10 minutes of building my adversary and I have built everything and researched every upgrade, and now we're just sending in larger and larger armies to take eachother out.In short: free game, fun game, needs more units/buildings/upgrades. Download it.			"

												Its a fun take on the Half Life 2 Games and i love rts (somtimes) it really shows the diffrence of power the rebles have and the combine have but the normal ai diffuclty is like playing hard mode and the easy mode lets you have time to actualy build objects but then the hostile ai takes very long time to cap points. the game should allow customizable AI like how long it will take for them to attack or cap the points. still this game is SO AMAZING worth the download!

												A fairly intuitive RTS, all in the delightful Half-Life universe.

Having vortigaunts and combine under your control is great fun. Give it a try IF you have Alien Swarm (it's required).			"

												This game has great potential and If you a always on the look out for anything new in the Half-Life series you have to check it out. I haven't played Alien Swarm yet but units move and use cover similar to Men of War but no where near as good combined with a base and unit building/training and resources gathering system that's like a cross between Starcraft and Company of Heroes. The terrain detail is a bit basic at the moment which makes the cover system pretty useless unless you build your own so more vibrant and detailed maps to fight on would be sweet.The AI can be a bit hit and miss. One match I played they put up a fight and the next match they built a base and did nothing.More unit variety would be great. Like the Scout car with the Tau Cannon for the Rebels, maybe some other HEV Suit special units and the Muscle Car with rocket passenger and mounted machine gun and DOG as your Ultimate unit limit to one at a time. To go against the plethora of Combine units that can be made available.The sounds are great all the weapons and voices are authentic could use some ambience to bring world alive.And finally the single player has the opportunity to create a story driven campaign that can expand on the Half-Life universe bringing more depth into how the rebellion begins.So better unit movement and model detail.Improved Terrain detail and interaction with environmentImproved AI for Skirmish and CampaignMore unit varietyIf they do this it will be a nice addition to the RTS genre and Half-Life alike.

For a Beta the gameplay is surprisingly solid, and the strategic depth offered would put certain AAA titles to shame. Especially the newer ones.I'll begin listing what I consider the pros and cons before heading on to why this is an excellent RTS:Pros: No dank ""Rock, Paper, Scissor"" system, no crushing ""Slippery Slope"", diverse and unconventional units and abilities, sticks to canon as much as possible, lot's of room for micromanagement of units, diverse maps, frequent updates. FREE with no microtransactions or DLC.Cons: Sometimes you'll have to host locally instead of using the game servers, which depending on your location might lag. Game might crash in rare circumstances, but is overal stable.Lambda Wars is like your old school assymetrical RTS games - with a twist.What makes Lambda Wars great?First of all: A lot of RTS games suffer from the ""slippery slope"" problem. Once you start losing it is very hard to get back on track.Lambda wars effectively solves this problem by allowing the action (Ability) of a single unit to sway the battle or even a match. For example: efficient RPG microing, a tactical grenade throw or a well manouvered Hunter dodge and charge. Even a last resort headcrab canister or dog leap can turn the game around. Most units and certain buildings come with these special (unlockable) abilities.Most RTS games also follow a stale ""Rock, Paper, Scissor"" recipe. Lambda Wars negates this. The effectiveness of a unit depends on its position, how it is micro'd and the composition of the force you are using as a whole. Not the hard counters many RTS games implement. (Swords beating bows, tanks beating infantry, etc.)Combine Elites can be used against Striders, and Veterans (Crossbow rebels) can wipe the floor with dogs. Yet it is also possible for the latter to beat the previous, even if the size of the force remains the same. Even resource starved teams and players can beat those that nearly control every flag. Late game units and structures aren't ""insta win"" buttons like in many strategy games. Barring a few abilities (like the explosive crossbow bolt) the game also tends to stick to the canon. The music captures the atmosphere of the game and the HL2 universe as a whole, while the sound effects are a mix between those imported from the base HL2 game and newly creates ones. While sometimes they don't seem to play when you select a unit or building, they are characteristic and not overwhelming. Though some of the effects are a bit too loud in my opinion.Besides that there are several gamemodes ranging from traditional ""Annihilation"" (destroying all enemy units and production buildings) to ""Overrun"", where you attempt to stave off increasingly large and more powerful hordes of zombies.Maps range from 8 player FFA zombie overrun frozen wastelands to smaller 1vs1 canyon style maps. There is enough variety to allow for continuous replayability. A sandbox mode is also included.Also note that both Rebels and Combine differ a bit in their resource gathering. While both require ""Requisition"" gained by captured (and upgraded - which increases earnings) flags, the Combine gather - generator generated - Energy as their secondary resource (which they need to store using batteries) while the Rebels gather scrap from (a limited amount of) scrap heaps.Without doubt I consider Lambda Wars as it is one of the best RTS games I have ever played (and I've played many in a 15 year time period, especially the classics), and it also ranks highly in my top 10 of best Source mods. If this is the Beta, then I have very high hopes for the full version. "

												HA HA man I love this game I play it all the time but there are a few flaws I will talk about and then I will talk about the perks with this game FLAWS:No map select screenModding battle music DOES NOT WORK IN THE AUDIO SETTINGSOnly 2 factions (may or may not be a good idea to play as zombies or antlions or xen creatures from HL1 OPFOR and BS)THINGS THAT SHOULD BE ADDED OR PATCHED Map Select Screen Modding battle music patchMaybe a new factionSome new songs for the LW ostA few more maps (I would like a few out in the sandtraps area in Tokyo (City 8) or next to Nova ProspektMore Combine units the rebels have a lot of variety of units why can't the combine like maybe a few HL2 BETA units like the cremator or combine assassinsNew weapons maybe OICW and HMG for combine and add the Conscripts to REBELS NEW BUILDINGS: Antlion repelants, Control point Fortifacation LEVEL 3 and a military base for the Rebel conscriptsPERKSThis game is an HL2 RTS (real time strategy) game THIS GAME IS FREEKIN AWESOME I play it all of the time I know most of the things I asked for are a bit demanding but I think they would really make the gameplay a bit better for some more experience you can play this on and offline and it is a great game hard to get used too after the different updates but more or less one of the best RTS games I have ever played I like it and I think you would too mostly because it is a comunity made game EP2 not sure if that is needed or not (cause I have EP2 and there are EP2 units) anyways it is a very fun and enjoyable game.

												It's a really good game/mod. I love the absolute style of of it, and the combine is of course my favorite faction (but thats just my opinion). It is really amazing how the creator(s) balanced each faction like. while the rebels are fine to build anywhere they want to, the combine have to stay near their power genoraters. Even though the combine are generally stronger overall(have more health, better range of weapons ect...), the rebels have a lot more manuverability. The only thing I would like them to fix in this update is the rebel's veteran unit and the combine's sniper unit. Both unit can't hit anything in a fight despite rebels being ""vetarans"" or snipers using ""marksman shot"" if they don't even hit there target once.			"

												It's a very good game, definitely on the rise, but there (for sure) is some polishing that needs to be done.Overall, I would recommend it for anyone - it's extremely fun, even in its beta state. Lambda wars is an RTS, which (for those who don't know) is the type of game where you command units. It does it very well, and sticks to the HL2 units pretty well, although in my opinion, it could use some more.Anyway, it's entirely free to play, so it's definitely worth a shot.			"

												Read the title, mind the price. This is a free beta mod, and free beta mods hardly match the quality of this brand new release. Kudos to Vortal Storm for pulling this one off. All basic RTS elements are present, from multiple (2) races to buildings, upgrades and balances. The AI is pretty awful, but that's what multiplayer is for. It certainly needs some work with the UI, pathfinding and optimizations (4+ players and you're gonna have a lag show) but overall it far exceeds expectations for the (lack of a) price10/10 still a better love story than twilight			"

Many modes to play, playable Resistance and Combine factions, etc.The only thing that I noticed that's missing is the ""hero"" type. Y'know, the super strong, OP units? I would love to have, like, Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance as heroes for the Resistance, while the Combine has an Advisor and a Breen unit.Oh, and also vehicles would be nice. Yeah..... a lot of stuff is missing. But this game is still fun as hell. Definitely play this.			"

I do not beleive this game gets the full recognition it deserves.			"

												This game lets you take control of the Half Life 2 Universe in an Age of Empires-esque way. Even though it's in beta it still brings me pleasure destroying all the Rebels and Antlions as the Combine. This game has pretty good maps and very good gameplay and you will enjoy every bit of time you put into this.			"

												Lambda Wars is a real time strategy (RTS) game, set in the oh-so-popular Half-Life universe. The game reminds me a lot of Company of Heroes, (wich i absolutely love) and looks like it borrowed some of it's components, but with great execution.I've played alot of the game, and loved every bit of it.And BTW, i just wanna say that this game has wonderful techsupport. Played with Mr. Darkness in one game, i told him about a bug that i knew. The week later, it was fixed:  


Announcement: Update (bug fixes) 
Lambda Wars Beta, Dec 19, 2015

			We released a minor update with the following changes: Fixed Global chat broken Strider becoming stuck during executing the Cannon ability when trying to execute another Cannon ability in some cases...		


So, In conclusion. I love the game, and can only suggest you play it. Both for the experience, but also, try to play it with your friends! It's fun as hell! Especially if you've started a week before them!			"

												It's a half-Life RTS!As a fan of the Half Life Series and a lover of RTS games, i can say that the fact this even exists is Amazing, and great that it does too, for i am ever happy to have found it.I can't even tell this is a mod when playing it, because it feels and looks like its own full stand-alone game, from how well its been done and put together, and it very well may be it's own game in the future, if it gets enough support and attention.. It's a very well done half-Life RTS done in a very Command and Conquer like-style.I'd Recommend this game/mod if you like either Titles, or both for that matter..and especially if you like the RTS Genre.

(then again, it's still beta)Small variety when it comes to rebel units (no vehicles for example)Not many buildings to choose from, I'd love to see watch towers as being buildable for rebelsThe Antlions aren't really developed that well, Maybe adding some extra units, like an Antlion Queen would fix this (again, still in beta)Still no HL39/10 - IGN "

												I quite enjoyed lambda wars. It's a excellent RTS made off of one of my favourite games. I enjoy both sides quality, and they're decently balanced (But I do think one side is stronger than the other.) I like the single player missions, fighting in multiplayer. I like finding new strategies to destroy enemies, I eventually got to the point where I started to screenshot and study maps. Man, I guess I can get into this game.. I don't like certain things about it though; a few headcrab pods at the start of the game can destroy the enemy, It can be hard to identify different troops from each other as a rebel. But other then that, I would definitely recommend getting this game. Best part of all the game is free.			"

Many modes to play, playable Resistance and Combine factions, etc.The only thing that I noticed that's missing is the ""hero"" type. Y'know, the super strong, OP units? I would love to have, like, Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance as heroes for the Resistance, while the Combine has an Advisor and a Breen unit.Oh, and also vehicles would be nice. Yeah..... a lot of stuff is missing. But this game is still fun as hell. Definitely play this.			"

												I wasn't into RTS' when they were popular,but I always liked the Idea of building a base. In lamda Wars,you do...something like that.This game takes place in the Half-Life universe,with You either playing as Rebels or Combine in the Main Game. Build Armorys for better units,Build a Sentry and put a person on it,you know the rules.Overall...the Game feels Clunky. There is a LOT of work that needs to be done,and I experience Frame drops quite frequently. But for the Low price of a Click of a Button,it's worth it. 7.5/10 - Spent more then 24 Hours playing,good With Friends,can't be Gordan Freeman.			"

												This is an amazing game, but it can be easily rigged, with the EXTREMELEY dangerous headcrab canisters, I've won entire games without even using my soilders, the tactic works like this, you buil 2-6 headcrab canister launchers, and you just keep sending in scanners and then launching headcrab canisters, no matter how large the enemy, this willA. Destroy a portion of their stuff and annoy themB.(this is if you non-stop do this) completley anhilate them, with nothing left, just zombies and zombies and bareley any enemiesThe headcrab canisters both deal damage upon landing (send this into a group of units) and then the rest will be infected. there are several other amazing tactics, but this is among the most annoying and fun to do. Long story short, be creative and make some really fun new ways to kill off enemies and win games.			"

												This Half Life version of an RTS is good and I would recommend this game to people who like RTS games. But because this game is in a beta version, it does have some bugs. Theres an issue of the missions are being extremely unfair because you are out numbered 10 to 1. But in the multiplayer, the issues are that the AI's can be extremly stupid or smart. Some of the units like some of the units on rebel side are overpowered. The combine snipers are overpowered as well. The loading time can be a bit slow at times but that can be overlooked. These are only some of the bugs that I have seen but overall these bugs can be overlooked because they are not game breaking and its a beta. This game is good and fun. When the full version of the game comes out it would be worth spending money on.			"

So right now you can only play with 2 factions which is the rebels and the combines, each one different in alot stuff like constructions and units, i prefer the combine because they have some freaking awesome units.  If you're looking to buy an  RTS game look no further, this is a hidden gem for free and more people should play it.			"

TIPS. Build citadels in spots if you play annihalation. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ would not know where are the rest of the citadels.TIPS. As rebels. RUSH THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF THE COMBINE BEFORE THEY GET THE THINGS MENTIONED ABOVE.TIPS for devs. Please reduce the time taking to train a single combine k thx.Well this is a beta so i cannot judge it so bad.

												Pretty fun game needs some improvements but it has potential. Several things can be added to both rebels and Combine and cover system can be a bit buggy sometimes but overall it's pretty fun to play.			"

												this game works suprisingly well, and i  love it. although at the time being it is a bit unbalenced, it's still in beta, so its fine.P.S. when you are in the menu press the button in the top right next to your picture, and you can play Dungeon Keeper.			"

												Nothing much to lose; it's free, so go test it out I guess.It's got its small bugs like its visual problems and sound bugs, but it's a unique addition to the Half-Life universe.Only problem is the player amount, but if you're like me and played Company of Heroes SP friends don't matter. :(			"

												Actually a pretty sick RTS game and interesting take on Half Life... I remember playing Garry's Mod and making the combines and antlions fight each other and made crazy stuff. The game is free, theres no real reason to not try it at least. It is kind of like company of heroes had a baby with idk... ghetto Supreme Commander. But it is pretty fun and quite advanced compared to most RTS games. Infantry will use environmental cover, multiple upgrades for infantry, especially different weapons and gadgets. You can deploy shield baton cops, almost like Roman legionaires, and then deploy your smg or ar troops behind. There's riot formations to advance on ranged troops, floor turrets that can be deployed or mounted guns than can be attached to cover and manned. Weapon upgrades typically go more like SMG>Shotgun>AR2>Grenades than Stat increases. There is really nothing to not like in this considering it came at $0 and there is very very few RTS games made now like this, where you construct buildings and mass troops to fight, a lot of it has gone to 4X or Total War style of combat.Although I think Antlions in full game would be good, as it would bring total races to 3, adding some more variety. Should easily be able to balance them with other 2 races. Either make NPC Antlions separate if you need to modify stats for balance, or replace them with NPC Zombies or something and use Antlions only as a playable race. I hate playing against the same faction so its pretty much always Me versing Rebels because combine is OP.			"
