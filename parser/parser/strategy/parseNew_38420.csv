												Back in the day I was dissapointed Fallout Tactics wasn't a 'real' roleplaying game like Fallout 1 & 2. Being a huge fan of the series I still gave this game a try and I wasn't dissapointed to say the least.Fallout Tactics, like the name already says, is a tactical game in the Fallout universe. You start by creating your main character and give him/her the skills you prefer. You start out with 2 other squad members and as the game progresses your squad members level up so you can adjust their skills like all (PC) Fallout games. After each mission you enter the worldmap to go to different locations like you're bunker where you can recruit new squad members and/or buy/sell equipment. Squad members can ofcourse die and won't return (unless you load your savegame).What sets Fallout Tactics apart from other tactical games for me:1. The variety of enemies. Sometimes you'll be battling Bugs, the other time you will be facing Super Mutants and several other enemies I won't name here (spoilers). Every enemy calls for a different approach. 2. The variety of missions. Sometimes you will have to rescue people, sometimes you have to do an escort mission. Also in most missions you've got a vehicle at your disposal.3. The variety of weapons. Fallout Tactics has a huge range of weapons, both realistic and unrealistic but they all fit in the game nicely.4. The use of skills in a game. Lockpicking, Healing, Defusing... it's all there. 5. Different 'races'. Your squad may also contain different kinds of races like ghouls and Super Mutants. All of them ofcourse have their own speciality/skills.6. Gameplay. The tactical combat just works really well in this game as a tactical game should obviously. Everytime you make a clean kill feels very good.7. Graphics. The graphics have aged very well in my opinion. Blood and gore is ofcourse included and every kill feels satisfying.8. Last but not least; The Fallout universe.Simply put in my opinion Fallout Tactics is still the best tactical game out there. Although I have to admit it's partially due the Fallout universe. I have played the XCOM series and Jagged Alliance and this game is still number 1 in my book.			"

												Fallout Tactics emphasizes tactical combat and strategy but limited interactions with non-player characters, but they can still be traded with. Instead of towns, Fallout Tactics centers around Brotherhood bunkers and missions. The bunkers serve as a central point for the Brotherhood, and players can obtain the services of quartermasters, mechanics, personnel yeomen, and medics.Combat in Fallout Tactics is a bit more complicated than the previous two Fallout games. Unlike those, which featured an individual turn-based system, Fallout Tactics features three combat types: Continuous Turn-Based (everyone can act at the same time, and action points are regenerated at a rate based on Agility), Individual Turn-Based (used in the original games) and Squad Turn-Based (each turn is given to a squad and include the ability to change stance, modifiers for height, and setting sentry modes).Fallout Tactics is also the first of the Fallout games to feature a multi-player mode. In this mode, each player controls a squad of characters and faces off against opposing players. During game setup, players are granted a number of points with which to purchase squad members and gear.Although the main character in the single player game has to be human, recruits from the brotherhood and characters in multiplayer matches can be of any of the six races featured in the game. Humans, Super Mutants, Ghouls, Deathclaws, Dogs or Humanoid Robots.			"

												Better combat mechanics then the other original fallouts but the story is a bit weak. Also the story/missions are linear unlike the other originals. The main advantage is the option to switch between real time and turn based gameplay during combat. Real time combat is the more difficult option but gameplay does go by much more quickly considering how large the levels are. This game is more of a shoot-um-up; Fallout 1 & 2 are much more story and gameplay driven. I highly recommend those also.			"

												If XCOM was friends with this chick called Call of Duty, they'd meet in a cafe shop, and go out for about a year before realizing they weren't right for each other. XCOM would then attend the local pub for booze and fistfights, and a shoulder to cry on, if the time proved right. There he would meet this really rad dude called Starcraft, and they'd go pick up chicks near the grocery market, and smoke blunts under the bridge with some other sketchy fellows. He'd soon fall in love with this beatiful woman named Manhunt, who he realized how bloody the world was, and he'd fall into a raging love for blood, and soon join the military before a huge tramautic nuclear war, that engulfs the world in flames, and he soon comes home to rubble, and a son named Fallout, who ingested mass amounts of Bubble Gum (containing mass amounts of Rads) to which he had to strangle the gum out of his throat, leaving his son scarred for life. Soon that son had given care to a pet lion, whom he shared many deep secrets with, and soon one day, the lion grew very suspicious of Fallout, and murdered him in his sleep, digesting his thoughts and forming into a second head, who spoke in very deep third person tones, talking about war, and how it never changes. After 20 years, Call of Duty returns and influences the lion into a quickscoping match, where the lion grows so intimidated, he vows never to return to FPS'  again, and sticks to RTS and tactical games and develops a game from the blood he cried, and it was called, ""Fallout Tactics""....Seriously thought its a pretty good game.9/10			"

												(Post-Fallout 2 Review) Fallout Tactic's story begins with a part of the West Coast Brotherhood seperating into another sect. The reasons behind this are political and moral as the West Coast Brotherhood are technology hoarders that want little to do with the people of the wastes, which conflicts with certain ideals. Thus creating a ""Mid-Western""-esc Brotherhood.You are introduced as an up and coming recruit for this new Brotherhood and take control of a new squad; With the sole purpose of completing objectives for the Brotherhood to expand it, and to later unravel the mysteries of the infamous ""Vault 0"".Fallout Tactics focuses heavily on the ""tactial"" portions of their six-man-squad combat, rather than Fallout 1 and Fallout 2's open world RPG elements. The open world in Tactics has nothing much to offer other than some random encounters and the locations which are only unlocked via missions making it kind of underwhelming. Also Tactics suffers from a majority of its plot being linear, with the only real decision making being toward the end of the game. This game however, is an extremely well crafted action-based tactial shooter with small amounts of RPG elements sprinkled into it and is a good change of pace from the previous iterations. Some of the missions that I played, were truly difficult and required a hefty amount of thinking power to push through them. I had a tremendously fantastic time with this Fallout, and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the series or to anyone who enjoys cRPGs.			"

With no way of getting my hands on fallout 4 any time soon, feeling sorry for myself i tryed FO Tactics and it made me feel as rich as a king. It helped me out in a big way, made me feel good, give me the drive to get up and go and a year later im playing fallout 4 on a 6700k with a 980ti.

												This is a really decent tactical squad game, I bought it as an x-com refugee looking for more of the same and was not disappointed. The building of your squad and play style is reminiscent of baldurs gate and you may nostalgically recognize more than a few voices throughout. I love to mess around with the multiplayer aspect, no one plays it really, but it's fun to have a friend over and make some custom characters and mow each other down once in a while. As far as the actual game goes, I don't really recall much of a story line, I don't think it really claims to have one either, it's more managing your characters and setting up combat. If you really wanted a story I'm sure you could piece it together through missions but that would probably be annoying.			"

												There is a good chance that you will like this game if you liked Fallout 1 & 2. This game allows you to have a team of up to six warriors to control, as well as an option between turn-based and real-time combat. The story is also interesting, and it also stays in the same universe as all of the other games. Also, if you like Xcom: Enemy Unknown, and would like another game with a similar playstyle but different setting, I'd highly reccomend getting this game.			"

												Squad-based tactical game in the universe of Fallout, with post-nuclear war havoc reigns the world, and you have to fight the hordes of Chaos in the name of Order. To be precise, you gotta kill much in the name of Brotherhood of Steel. But I guess you've figured that out by yourself, simple by reading the name of the game. I'll say even more of obvious things now, so for those who are short-in-temper for reading, I suggest to skip to the bottom right away.I remember that at time when it was released, the plenty of critics were against it. They were very angry with that approach on beloved universe of Fallout 1&2, which ruined one of the brightest RPG experience ever... That was common thought back than.Now it's 2016 year, it's been 15 years after game's release. What's the situation now, why there are so many positive reviews on Steam, why people still enjoying the game, that was almost completely sinked after release? There are two main answers: first, it is still branded as Fallout game, even if the story is not ""canonical"". Classic nonetheless, as people say. Now, the second reason... surprisingly, it is a fair tactical game! Certainly not the best in the genre, but hey! - all good games in that ""tactical"" genre you can count with your fingers! Every working approach there worth its money!Certainly, Fallout Tactics is not for everyone. If you don't like games where you need to clear levels from enemies in the quite slow-paced turn-by-turn style, just pass by. And even if you are good with turn-based combats, in the most cases, I'd recommend you to buy and play Wasteland 2 instead. It is providing much better experience for much wider auditory.Fallout Tactics has many downsides. The story tastes... not fresh, and even not-satisfying. The battle system is good, but not calculated enough. The worst part of it is moving in turn-based mode: the maps are big, and your legs are quite short! What's even worse, the bugs with way-mapping still there, just like I remember them from 2001 year. The skills and all other SPECIAL system from the original Fallout also not fitting in, considering the fact it is not a proper RPG, but rather a ""shoot'em all"" pattern turn-based combat simulator.But... all of those minuses are manageble, if you have some temper and will. All but one, the final of the story there is way worse than in the Fallout 3. So, even strongest by will cannot really vouch for replayablity in that game. Unless they are not bothering with the story at all.Multiplayer could be a mind-blowing thing, but no. Not even the possibility to ride deathclaws can fix some real difficulties with combat system and the possibility to connect with other players (its LAN only now, servers are gone)... Simply put, there is no fun. You'd be much better with XCom Enemy Unknown multiplayer, by any reason.So. Why you can buy that game? Obviously, the main reason, for it goes in the bundle with the main games, Fallout 1&2. I even remember some events when the keys for that trio (F1, F2 and F tactics) were distributed free of charge...Why play it? Well, if you have a thing for turn-based squad tactical games, with lots of guns, and big maps filled with all the menagerie of Wasteland... Give the game a shot, it is worth one. Like I already said, there are too few of decent squad-based tactical games, to turn up your nose against it.My rating is 69/100, for I forget nothing.			"

												Had alot of fun in this game. Spent alot of time in it. It's all together a good game. I recommend it to anyone who likes Fallout 1 & 2, and strategy games.There are still moral choices. There is still a good story. Some amount of mods. It's more tactical which ofcourse means more gun play. You can switch options on and off between turn base and real time. Also you can change if you run all the time, some of the time, or just to walk all the time. They added prone, crouch, and standing buttons. So more planning. The only thing I really advise you do is save before a gun fight of any kind, because If you don't it can set you back quite a bit.			"

												I have to say this game is incredible despite its (mostly graphical) glitches. I generally don't care for tactical squad games but this one got it right. Setting up an ambush and tricking a bunch of raiders into it to then watch them get machine-gunned into hamburger is really fun. After I got used to the interface, which did take a while, I'd spend a lot of time setting up elaborate traps and carefully positioning each squad member. When one of my squad died it actually made me cringe as you tend to get pretty attached to them after a while. Fallout Tactics is different than Fallout 1 and 2 but I played it a lot more and got far more involved in the game.			"

 ""Super Mutant beat the living crap out of Brian, inflicting 362 points of damage.” Fallout Tactics changed the focus from a role-playing game (rpg) to squad-based strategy game. With this shift in basic gameplay most rpg aspects from the two first Fallout instalments have been removed, e.g. sequence of missions is fixed and linear, no cities, limited exploration and character dialogues.One of the greatest changes is the introduction of the squad-based combat system, which gives you complete control of each member of your party (up to 6 members). With each story-related mission, you can pick up additional team members with different talents, allowing you to customize your team to suit your preferred tactical approach.In addition you have the possibility of the continuous turn-based (ctb) combat mode, which for the most part should be called real-time mode. From a strategic viewpoint the game lives up to its title, in providing a captivating tactical gameplay with several ways to successfully complete each mission. Trivia: The fan community has released one mod called Redux (hosted on No Mutants Allowed), that fixes most problems of the game. It can be downloaded on the link below (thanks to Cory?killer).http://www.nma-fallout.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1382 Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												I had almost exclusively played turn-based strategy games or slow RTS games with empire-building, resource gathering, etc. before I saw this for sale secondhand at a very cheap price and decided to try it. Bear in mind my review is that of a rank amateur, but someone who has played this particular game all the way through several times, on Steam and off.If there is anyone else out there like me, someone who doesn't enjoy fast-paced first-person shooter games but still wants a *little* bit of real-time pressure on your game play, this is a great game for that. The learning curve is pretty short, considering this type of game was unfamiliar to me. The post-apocalyptic setting is at time humorous and never takes itself  too seriously. By today's standards the animation is a little clunky, and graphics processing a bit cumbersome.This was possibly the first game I've ever played where friendly fire was a real danger. At first it was frustrating that I couldn't expect my PC's to shoot around each other, but then it simply became a natural part of the tactical challenge. (Why would I ever realistically expect NOT to be injured when someone standing right behind me opens up with a .50 cal in my direction?)For anyone working on third-person sequels to this: please do something about the ladders and stairs. Make them more  fluid and accessible. I've had many a player character shot to pieces because the computer can't figure out how to send two of them down a wide staircase at the same time!			"

												  Do you like the Fallout stories and world? Do you enjoy big guns and making mutants go boom?  Then this game might be for you if you are down for running a 6 man (or woman or mixed) team of soldiers in retaking the wasteland from the Mutants, ghouls, raiders and other enemies you meet along the way! This game uses a large over world map that you can freely explore (ahla Fallout 1 and 2) and run into random encounters or just plot a point to your next objective.  Once you hit an encounter or your next objective it changes over to a 3/4th top down view of the battlefield and gives you command of your troopers.  You can either run the game in real time or in turn based (as in Fallout 1 and 2).  I've found the game much more enjoyable in the real time element.  You can for instance have a sniper climb a tower to spot enemies, then sneak a couple of other people up to either side of a door and set them to fire on anything that comes rushing out.  Once the sniper takes the first shot it's game on. Honestly the reviews when the game came out largely panned the game but I feel like it deserves better than it got.  This is one of my favorite games.   If you like Final Fantasy Tactics or Jagged Alliance or are just a hard core Fallout fan this game is more than likely something you would enjoy.  Or as another endorsement I still own my disc copy of this game from when it came out, but I went ahead and bought it again on Steam just for convience.			"

												Seriously underrated Fallout game. R. Lee Ermey screams at you to take your squad of savages around the wasteland, righting wrongs or committing war crimes as you fight through hordes of raiders, mutants, robots, and somewhat fidgety controls and AI pathfinding. It's not the same RPG experience as Fallout 1 and 2, and while your choices and successes/failures during a mission do affect the story to an extent, it's mostly just a fun but punishing real-time tactics game, with little in the way of dialogue choices or characterization.On the downside, it takes a bit to get into, and you'll want to play around with the turn-based/real-time settings to find out what works best for you. If you find you're underpowered, turn on Ironman mode for extra XP and make sure your dudes have skills in multiple gun types, because Small Guns get useless 2/3 of the way through. Lastly, it has the best looking power armor in the series, and I'm shamelessly doing a review for a badge.			"

												Pretty cool, if not very tactical. It's basically Fallout 1 and 2 combat, except you have a party, and can play in realtime, if you so choose.The inability to pause and give orders (ala Baldur's Gate 2) pretty much means you just kind of inch your way forward through the levels with autofire on, about as 'tactical' it gets.In any case, still has that cool fallout setting, the locations and scope of the battles is impressive, the armaments are pretty badass, and it gets really really challenging later in the game.Gewd if you're a fallout buff, just don't go expecting deep squad-based strategy.

												Let's start this review off by saying that this game has a very mixed reputation, and for a very good reason.Fallout Tactics isn't like its forefathers Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. Fallout Tactics is a strategy game, and unlike its forefathers, has no speech skill, no major RPG elements, and more straightforward, action based gameplay. It has a very unique story, and is so far the only Fallout game that has its setting in the Midwestern United States.Fallout Tactics has voiceacted dialog, unlike Fallout 1 and 2. Fallout Tactics also offers four difficulty settings, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane. Easy is about what you would expect, easy, it makes the game very very easy and significantly more easygoing. Normal isn't much different, but it too offers a more story and action based game than the two harder difficulties. Hard is a minor step up from Normal, forcing you to play more adaptively, and sparringly with your supplies, as vendors either don't restock, or you have to complete a mission for them to, making supplies very restricted if you waste them. Insane is exactly what you would expect, insane. It's borderline impossibly hard if you play with Tough Guy Mode turned on, which I will touch on in a second. Insane mode drops your accuracy by a flat 20%, halves your average damage, curbs your chance to get criticals to extremely low, doubles enemy damage, resistence, accuracy, and worst of all, the enemy will get critical hits with frightening frequency. Strategy is everything on Insane. Your supplies become even more limited, and you will die many many many times, which makes Tough Guy even more bitter.Tough Guy Mode makes it so you can only save when you are in a bunker, which makes Mission 1 extremely frustrating and bitter. You start off not in a bunker, with no autosave for the character you made, meaning if you die, you're going to have to remake your character all over again. Some people would say that's a very poor design choice, and I'm inclined to agree. Tough Guy Mode is something I have only ever played Fallout Tactics with turned on, extra difficulty and in this case, a Resident Evil style restrictive save system appeals to my nostalgia for difficulty driven older games. It's not too frustrating on all 3 of the easier difficulties, but on Insane, it's definitely going to make you angry once or twice per level, because there are going to be more than a few occassions in which you're going to either lose a character, or die and have to restart, due to bad luck with criticals or missing a shot you desperately needed to hit.Fallout Tactics also comes with an editor which you can use to mod and edit the game yourself, and it's extremely well made, and isn't hard at all to learn how to use. Among the few things you can do with it, you can remedy the frustration of Mission 1 on Tough Guy Mode by checking a box in the editor that registers Mission 1 as a ""bunker"" which allows you to save after you make your character, open the editor, turn it off, and after that it's up to you, as you can save whenever you want for the duration of that specific save game's Mission 1, or you can save once immediately after making your character and never do it again out of honor, it's a way to alleviate the tedious nature of having to recreate your character multiple times if you're playing on a harder difficulty. The editor's readme.txt offers a fully comprehensible manual on what you need to do to use the editor, including details on what files you need to extract.There is also a mod for Fallout Tactics that's very very similar to the Restoration Project in that it revamps a lot of the games issues and kinks, and all in all the Redux Mod, as it's called, is very well made, if albeit a bit more difficult in general, namely a few enemies are inserted into very cheap places, like corners, with weapons that have the potential to kill you instantly, and on Mission 1, with TG turned on, you can probably imagine why that will drive you crazy, which is namely what made me abuse the life out of savescumming on M1 with TG on on Insane, as both remaking my character, and the possibility of having to restart the level over and over again due to cheap enemy placement wore its welcome out very very quickly.Charisma is also a significantly more important stat than in the previous games, or maybe not, that varies on if you used to have a posse of companions in F1 and 2. Charisma in Fallout Tactics dictates how quickly you will advance in ranks in the Brotherhood of Steel, which controls the quality of goods the Brotherhood Quartermasters will have, the quality of recruits you will have access to, and also, how soon you acquire Power Armor.The level design is more straight along a single path than previous games, and the sandbox elements are extremely limited. There is also an infamous glitch that's unavoidable in which you will get several random encounters per second, which unless you have 100% Outdoorsman, will drain your already extraordinarily finite resources, which is extremely laborous, and frustrating, as you have the potential to die during one of these, and on Tough Guy, that will send you back to your last save at a bunker. These random encounters aren't particularly unique, or fun either, as they usually consist of the same general enemies that are commonplace for that area, which can range from komodo dragons, to deathclaws, and even just a bunch of ghostly looking civilians. It can be extremely frustratingly tedious.Do I recommend this game? For people that enjoy strategy games, and even just diehard Fallout fans, definitely, it has drawbacks, and many flaws, but then again, doesn't any game?			"

												I know that a lot of people had problems with this game because it differed from the original fallout, but I'm going to attemp to explain to people why this game is great and you should probably buy it. First off I'll admit, yes, this game is WAAAAYYY different from fallout 1 &2, But not all the changes are bad, the graphics have substantially improved, and character customization is almost as strong as in the first 2 games. However, the main reason I feel this game is worth buying is because they focus on the combat. A lot of people will disagree with me, but I think combat is something the original fallout games should have focused more on. This game focuses almost entirely on it and somehow manages to pull it off. The fallout series most notable feature is its dynamic choice system, in that choices you make directly and indirectly influence the world around you. This game has very little of that, so if really want a diverse range of choices that can effect you negatively and positively, then you probably won't find much here to entertain you. Choices are very limited, at best and charisma influences nothing but your availiable recruits. This means that most of what makes up a fallout game isn't present in a fallout game, treason, I know. BUTTTTTTTTTTTTTT, the combat is so fricking awesome that I can't help but recommend this game, if you enjoy turn based or RTS combat with a touch of non-canon fallout lore, this game is definitely for you.

												Fallout Tactics was a game that broke away from what fallout was known for, in this entry the combat feels like it was focused on over the story. This redirection of focus caused many fans to not appreciate the improvements made to combat and other game mechanics that where overhauled. The plot of the game is not bad enough to keep you from playing, after all its a Fallout game so you should expect that same amount of fun you would get from any of the other ""classic"" Fallout games.

												Tactics is a step off the familiar path and neither like Fallout 1/2 or 3, NV, 4 and we kind of have to admit it's the runt of the litter of the Fallouts, it's even been declared mostly non-canon. I guess it's really hard fitting in the best ending of Tactics with everything, so I don't blame 'em. (whoever 'them' is)Still there's lots to like. Aesthetically I'd say it's one of the best, if not the best, Fallout(s), especially if you consider it's from 2001. The BoS and their power armor look just spectacular and you have to love the juicy gore when returning fire against super mutants from cover with an M249 SAW and scoring a critical. And making anything biological run into a minefield or eat grenades...damn.As the title suggests, this game is more about squad building and tactical planning than questing or picking the correct dialogue options. (in fact, you don't get to pick) Also, it's got a continuous turn-based mode that makes the game feel pretty much real-time.Unless you make things really hard for yourself (==don't read up on character builds), this is probably the shortest Fallout game.I consider it among the essential classics despite all it's differences and kindly recommend trying your hand at annihilating some raiders, beastlords, deathclaws, mutants and robots this fine evening.

												Fans of the original Fallout games used to hate this game back in 2001, because they were all waiting for the follow up, that had been brewing for quite some time at the time, to Fallout 2 and then they got this: a bloody amazing Tactical Combat game, but without speech and dialogue.. I loved it, especially the Continous Turn Based (CTB) option coupled with the Aggressive Sentry Modes with variable Accuracy Thresholds. Awesome!! And if the combat got too messy or overwhelming you could always switch to turn-based. Splendid. Finally a game that lets you deal with all the cannonfodder in a nice and easy way. Levels, levels, levels. It was also the best looking Fallout game ever with dynamic lights, even though it was a bit less cozy, cartoony and charming, but the intro is awesome nonetheless and there is a bit of choice along the way, but it's mostly RPG at gun-point. So, obviously the only thing missing here is the Speech skill.. And thus the use and need of Charisma is rather limited - to just the speed of your ranks and bartering. There is also a Tough Guy mode, but the end mission is quite long in itself, which is the reason why I never finished it as Tough Guy - I simply don't have the time to finish the last mission in one session. Combat is more flexible also in turn-based, because you are not stuck on a grid.. It's total free-form-360. There are Sentry modes with four Accuracy Thresholds: 95, 66, 33 and 1% where you team will react automatically. There are also three stance positions: Standing, Crouch and Prone. You can switch all at once, in minor teams or individually and they don't switch from one stance to the other unless you make them.. There are also both Special and Random Encounters (RE) when you travel the wasteland. It's both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it's a source of EXP, guns and ammo and a curse because at times you'll be really annoyed by the sheer number of it. Having someone with Outdoorsman becomes quite crucial. Every container, which includes both vehicles, boxes, lockers and rercruits at the Recruit Master can be used to store equipment. I think there is a kind of economy in the game that deflates the value of things you sell and therefore it's not a bad idea to pile up huge quantities before dropping them off at the Quarter Master shop. As you progress the number and variation of Recruits at the Recruit Master will grow, but they will not advance unless you ""tag"" them all at least once. The ""tagging"" involves adding them all to your team, before you switch them back to the pool of Recruits. That way they will also get Experience, whenever you do and thus will never become too weak to join you. Just remember to come back and advance them. Along the way you will also encounter different vehicles that you can actually bring with you, drive around in and use as armor with your whole team as gun mounts and they can also be used as Storage for all the loot you find - just remember to bring a member with the Repair skill, which you'll need to repair the damage it gets from accidents or RE along the way; having a Pilot is an added bonus. Today, a truly wide-screen adjustment would have been nice, even though I think there is a mod for it I just can't be bothered to install it, somehow.. Well, there are some low res Wide-screen choices (16:9 and 16:10)..  I've played and replayed it a hell of a lot, before it appeared on Steam.The combat of X-COM and Wasteland are just like flies on the windscreen compared to this.			"

												Highly recommended.  I've ""collected"" this game on every format it's been release on.  Can't recommend highly enough actually.   It's from the early 2000's and holds top rank for me, right next to X-com 1 & 2, Fallout 1 & 2, and Half Life.   So many hours spent in this game over the years that I probably have a 1 cent per hour value ratio on it.   I can't say if everyone will enjoy it since it does play a little more wonkey than what it did back on Windows XP, it's still an amazing game and highly worth playing to anyone who is a fan of the tactical turn based combat and exploration.

												Excellent tactical game.  Can be played either as either Turn Based or Real Time, or better yet, a mix of the two.  I love the turn based combat from the first two Fallout games, but in this game, I generally stay in real time, or Continuous Turn Based, as they call it.  There is a ton of combat, so the CTB is much faster unless you get to a particularly hard part.  Even in the CTB there is plenty of tactics and positioning before you engage.  Having your squad sneak up behind a barrier in a crawl, then have them simultaneously pop up and burst AK47 fire and shotgun blasts into the enemies face is great fun.  Get caught off guard and find yourself swarmed, don't panic, simply hit Return and enter turn based.The campaign is interesting, and all the leveling and character customization from the Fallout RPGs (1/2)  is here.  Throw in the scavenging feel of a post apocalypse world and you can't lose.  Strongly recommend this game.			"

												I love this game! Yes it has a lot of faults and is largely out of cannon, but once you get used to it (which honestly could take a few times through and you may have to abandon a game) it is tos of fun. The real trick is that you need to plan your team from the beginning especially h your main character. This is the main reason you might get to a point at which you can't advance. Once you get the hang and figure out which guns skills and traits are the best you'll have tons of fun. I even began modding the character images and background stories just for fun!

I really enjoy the tatical combat and building up characters.  Though I wish that all the edible buffs did not have such serious side-effects.  An important point is that any Windows version after 8 should be using the ""Windows 8 workaround"" option to play.  The game is too old for Windows 8 and above to play regularly.  This means even a desktop shortcut will not work, only starting from your Steam games account.Enjoy this bleeding bloody throw-back game!			"

												Not mayny folk out there like this game, for varying reasons... the hardcore Fallout fans refuse it because it lacks a solid 'character cenetric' story RPG.The fans of the new Fallout games probably dislike this because of it's archaic graphics (or its less than forgiving controls& interface)But I really like this game, it falls neatly in a place between the original Fallout games and Jagged Allience 2, I love both of these things and this game merges the best of both.I've played through probably 4 times before I even bought it on steam, my CD version has the scratches to prove its worth to me... And I'll not shy away from playing it again. There's something about the management of a team of guys coupled with turn based (or faux real-time) combat that ticks all the boxes in my brain.If you ever enjoyed Jagged Allience 2, this is certianly worth a go.Pros:- quite a big game.- nicely written (and in keeping with Fallout originals) lore.- nice squad options and varience.- I personally like the controls.cons:- tricky to get into- some lore breaks the Fallout concept :(- unforgiving view ( I wish i could rotate the screen at times)- old graphics (and it shows!)- you likely need a 'workaround' to play it on most modern PC			"

												The not so Good---It is infuriating that you cannot rotate the camera, as it makes it difficult to position your squadies at times.  I wish there were an autosave.  I am the type of gamer that is prone to forgetting and I lost two members of my team after three hours of unsaved gameplay last night.The missions are essentially all the same (so far.)  Not as unique or visually apealling as say, Wasteland2.Also, you use your skills way more in Wasteland.  I havent had to pick but two locks in three missions and have used no other skills. The Good---There is an open map with random encounters that you are free to explore, so leveling up is done on your pace, not by game missions.  The enemies are fun to kill. Wide variety of weapons.  Hitting some waste-skum with both barrels of of a shotgun is satifying. haha  You can pick between real time combat, which is insanely awkward and pointless in my opinion and two types of turnbased combat.(One member at time interspersed with enemies or your whole squad, then enemy's whole squad.)Cool story line for fans of the Fallout universe.  Cool Fallout atmosphere with Pip-Boys, Bunkers, and Rad Scorpions. Gunny does the voicework for the BoS general. hahaSo, all considered, it is maybe unfare to compare this to Wasteland 2, as this costs ten bones and Wasteland costs thirty.    But for the price, any fan of this stype of gameplay will be happy with the purchase.   Infact, I wish I had bought the Classic Collection.			"

One of the best games I have ever played. I played it already several times over and it brings a nice feeling every time.  The game is a tactical role playing game, if you played XCOM.. it is similar but you tend to get more involved with your team.  The SPECIAL sistem (Strength Perceptio Charisma Inteligence Agility Luck) works very nice.  The game's atmosphere is really immersive.. you can really feel like you're fighting in the wasteland all sorts of enemies while you are pursuing a plot.  Random encounters, bonus objectives plus altering your starting SPECIAL configuration to get different skills and perks for a different gameplay strategy for your main character contributes to get a good replayability. On the minus side, ..  may happen that the game crashes (experienced 2-3 times in 40 hours of gameplay)  Tough Guy is not very attractive.. you can only get 2 extra level up's (10%).. would have preffered the enemies getting tougher + unable to save except for bunkers .. and your character's being able to get  10+ level-ups.. Other remarks.. the game seems to be a bit rushed out.. there are a lot of weapons in the game.. but once you played the game once or twice you will easilly identify the ones that are really good. Some traits are really not usefull.. And some of the secondary skills are underused and I have the feeling that also Luck is underused in the game (with the exception of criticals and getting some specific the perks), also some of the random encounters are not very useful.. I heavilly recommend using the resolution mod and checking out the walktrough from GameBanshee while you are playing this game... it will show you how to unlock the bonus mission and if you end up thrashed and hopeless (for instance when you encounter super mutants for the first time.. maan that's a wake up mission..:)..). Also only play on continuous mode, do not even try turn-based mode since due to the game being rushed out, testers only used continuous mode to do the testing.Every once in a while when I want to set my mind on something else.. I play some FoT .. For me it is perfect.. it's much more specific than Fallout 1 and 2 (you get mission briefings.. and you basically know what you have to achieve), much less head akes than Fallout 3+ (which are more like shooters from my point of view).. but FoT manages to remain so immersive.. and the fact that most of the early equipment is actually real equipment you can buy today makes the feeling even more genuine and relatable. (to the end it gets really Sci-Fi :).. but that's really ok too!) "

												Great game with pleasant player movement and has a varied amount of protagonists. You are apart of the Brotherhood of Steel (as the name states). You must battle monsters and people who have lost their mind or are just plain insane. You are in post-war North America and the group has formed from the United States Armed Forces. You must battle other factions to be superior.			"

												At the time of writing this I have played 110 Minutes and i have to say i love it. I got it running by going with windowed then press the fullscreen button and it works just fine. It is pretty difficult though so if you aren't good at games like this don't buy it. The reason i love it is because i have been a fan of NV, 3, and 4, though it is very different. So Save whenever you kill    an Enemy because you might die to the next one.			"

												the best tactical squad sim I've played. Only shadowrun comes close. To be fair I haven't played X-Com. But yeah I literally spent hours making note cards of profiles to organize the best team. Also, this game has waayyy more of a military vibe than any other Fallout game. This game has R Lee Erny and this feels like Full Metal Jacket in the Fallout universe.			"

												Fallout Tactics is known as the black sheep of the series. For a variety of reasons, some of them justified. This game wasn't designed by Black Isle, instead it was licensed off to third party studios.Now what I should state is what this game isn't. Fallout Tactics doesn't feature any towns and the game's story is mostly mission based with breaks inbetween to visit Brotherhood of steel bunkers. It also takes place in Illinois, so the original Fallout continuity is also slightly butchered.However, Tactics is an isometric turn based tactical shooter where you control a squad of soldiers. Your squad is entirely customizeable and all level up like you do. Later on in the game you get access to more unique party members like Super Mutants and Deathclaws. The Tactics in general are very pronounced in this game, and it is very rewarding to complete a mission.In general I believe it mostly got hate because of the dumbed down spin off nature of the game. But if you go into it not expecting the Fallout 3 we were promised before Black Isle bit the dust, you'll find yourself a fairly decent tactical shooter for a good price.			"

												This game. I have such mixed feelings about this game. I personally enjoyed it a lot but it is definetly not for everyone. On one hand its keyboard smashingly hard at times, the AI is lacking, good luck ever using multiplayer,and the campaign is as linear as the equator. On the other hand its an amazing idea to have a fallout themed turn based strategy with open ended character customization, a good sized aresenal of weapons, and a story that will take a long while to beat allowing you to really flesh out your character to fit your play style.  If you are a die hard fallout fan the yes insta buy this title. Otherwise just keep in mind that this is a hard and long game that can be as fun as you want it to be. It was designed to let you play through levels in a variety of styles. If you choose to be a grenade lobbing madman so be it, if you grind through the game inch by inch at a super slow pace with a squad of nohing but snipers and it didn't seem like any fun its because thats how you decided to play. It doesn't have much replayability but overall I think its a pretty good one and done.			"

												My playtime on steam isn't indicative of my actual time spent on this game. I own the hardcopy. All I will say is out of the 10000+ hours I've spent on gaming in my life, this is on my top 5 list of greatest games of all time. That being said, I am a little biased to this specific genre because isometric rpgs are my favorite single player style games. IMO this game was more ""fun"" than Fallout 2. I just love me some Active Battle System with sentry mode and 66% accuracy auto fire. The most iconic mission for me was defending a small house from waves of super mutants. every character had either .50cal brownings or rocket launchers plus a large amount of pre place explosives. This mission was extremely difficult without turn based mode on but oh so satisfying to beat after many attempts. Did you know you can recruit Riddick in this game as a special encounter character? Yea, you know, Vin Diesel's Riddick. He can see in the dark and has incredible unarmed combat abilities. So cool.			"

												Fallout Tactics is a great game. Anyone who says this doesn't deserve the name ""Fallout"" hasn't played Fallout. The story is great, entertaining, and engaging, and straight out of the Fallout fiction. While the RPG elements of the previous two Fallout installments are mostly absent, Fallout Tactics gives you complete control of each member of your party down to the clothes they wear, the guns they carry, and exactly what they do. As you travel the wastes, you can pick up additional team members and types, making the customizability of this game and replayability immense. I have played and replayed this game multiple times, as the graphics and gameplay have stood up over the years quite well. My only complaint is the linearity of the storyline, but even then you can just go wander the wastelands if you feel like it, which is fun in itself.			"

												Hello Fellow Wastelanders,I strongly suggest the purchase of Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel! If you enjoyed Fallout or Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game, then you'll most certainly enjoy this game! It's another turn-based system game, but, this time, it involves a squadron, so you aren't only taking control of one character. You control your Brotherhood of Steel comrades in the squad combat system like you would your single character in the first two Fallouts. It's ultimately a great game with a good storyline that I strongly recommend. It is something a little different from your average Fallout, but it's still an incredible game as it still takes place in the same Fallout universe, meaning all the lore is still present! It's most definitely worth the money!-Kyle James			"

												Ooooowwwh the Childhood Memorys :)I had not been playing this Game since 6-7 Years, go Grab a Beer and Grind Your Squad through the Entertaining Campaign. I features Lots of Different Playable Characters ( Ghouls, Deathclaws, Mutants, Robots  and Humans ) thrown into a 6 Headed Team, you can decide to go Realtime or Roundbased Combat.Overall you just go and do a Combat oriented Linear Campaign with your Squad, but there is Site Quests, Optional Stuff and some Decision Makings aswell. Your are allowed to Loose your Sidecharacters, but not your alter Ego Maincharacter on your missions.The Missions itself are Moderate Difficult but get harder as the Campaign goes on, your doing different stuff ( free some Hostages, Hack a Computer, bring your Humvee trough a City ) and there are nice Charcters here and there which tell you Lore stuff (nice Voiceacting)Overall, if you search for a good Tactical Combat Game in the Fallout Universe, get it now  !If your here for a deep Story and lots of talking options your should get Fallout1+2.Its a solid 7/10   (with the Fallout Tactics Redux Mod a 9/10) "

												First, let me clear the air on this one by saying I bought this game when it first came out on disc. Back then I think it was actually shipped on a CD-ROM and not even a DVD, but anyway that's why I show only 6 minutes played. I repurchased this game on Steam and it's a title I will take out every so often and play for a few days, and then set aside again to be enjoyed later. When I first bought the game, I played it pretty intensively, single and multiplayer.The premise of this game is simple but the implementation is amazing. There is a little gem of a game called Final Fantasy Tactics that I used to play on Playstation which was one of my favorites; I think it got over-looked and disrespected to some extent because it was not a traditional Final Fantasy game. It was a game set in the world of Final Fantasy but focused on tactical battles rather than RPG elements, that would take place on small 3D maps where terrain and positioning of your warriors mattered greatly. Fallout Tactics is very much along the same lines: a game set in the world of the Fallout game series, but focused on tactical small-scale combat rather than role-playing. The developers of Tactics did this extremely well!What you have here is a game that captures the fierce joy of the warrior risking his life and fighting to the death. In Tactics, you command a squad of warriors as they fight through a 3D map to accomplish certain objectives. You watch the action from above in isometric view, and directly move and perform actions with each of your squad members in a turn-based style. The maps can be the size of a small town; large enough that it takes some time to work your way across a single battle. Troop positioning and the ""lay of the land"" is vitally important for your success. Your troops can stand, crouch, and go prone, and move in all those positions, and since the map is rendered in 3D the height of various points of cover and ""line of sight"" principles mean you can really outmaneuver the enemy (or be outmaneuvered, if you aren't careful!)During the course of the SP game you complete a campaign that progresses in difficulty. You get access to a pool of recruits that you can choose from with different skills, and those skills are honed and developed in combat, so the more you use particular recruits the more powerful they will become. This makes it especially painful if you lose a beloved comrade in combat, as combat deaths are final! All part of the glory, my friend.This game has great graphics for its age and still looks good; it has lots of different weapons and skills you can use to achieve your goals; there is extreme freedom to decide how to tackle each map, just as you would expect from a Fallout title; and there is blood and gore and vicious, bullets-flying, clubs smacking, rockets-exploding combat action that will keep you entertained every minute.I'm not sure how I can else I can say this other than: go ahead and buy this game if you like tactical combat or RTS or Rainbow Six-style squad battles or seeing a man's torso distintegrate into bloody chunks from a close-range shotgun blast.10/10 Find high ground and go for headshots with a scoped rifle!!!

												This game, though non-canon in anyway, is still a must have, must play for any fan of the series. Its battle system was and is a breakaway from its previous two installments and continues, in my opinion—which I respect, hehe—to be better than some of the latest RTS, squad-based games in the market out right now.  Not to mention any names, but the current games' system is all-together turn-based (your squad then the A.I.'s squad); this one on the other hand can be setup to allow the action to flow continuously, hence CTB or continuos turn-based. Overall, I think this game is superb, always have and always will. As far as story goes,  as mentioned earlier, the game's story has been held as non-canon to the Fallout series, but with the continous flow of Fallout titles, and huge storyline these contain, I think there is still a lot of room to include this game's story into the Fallout canon continuum. For example, making the bad ending the canon ending and making the emergent enemy public enemy number one in the next Fallout title (so many ideas, if only Bethesda didn't dismiss this game's story out completely. As mentioned earlier though: this title's a must have, for many reasons. Once you play it, you will really know why.Not a MicroForte agent			"

												Fallout Tactics is the unloved child of the series but it holds a special spot in my heart.Despite the clunky ‘real time’ combat system and weird un-lore friendly story the game has real character. The devs choose to move away from the vault dweller being the main protagonist and you create a character of the waste land and join the brotherhood of steel as the most junior rank and force you to work your way up the chain of command.The level design is solid and generally give you a variety of ways to complete the mission. This combined with a nice range of teammates to select from and gear to customise your character.I really love the ambient sounds that bring the stages to life. The raider bases and towns are well designed and again provide you with options to exercise strategy. I like the fact that the game tries to push you to setting up ambushes rather than simple running and gunning through the enemy like so many other games.This game is by no means perfect but I enjoyed in more than a dozen AAA titles i've played in recent years.

												For serious gamers who want a long squad-based game -- it's challenging, it has hours of gameplay, the Fallout universe is faithfully recreated and the production values are top-notch. It's not a game for everyone, though; the difficulty and squad-based strategy will turn some gamers off.The game has plenty of swearing, and lots of gore. I like running around nearly dead--you leave a big trail of red wherever you go. Ok, so maybe it is over the top, but at least somebody still has some cajones out there.All in all, it is an enjoyable game with an intriguing storyline, a captivating environment, and engrossing gameplay.

												I suggest any prospective players of Fallout Tactics ignore the rose-tinted nostalgia contained in many of these positive reviews, and realize that even at the time of release Fallout Tactics had a well-deserved reputation as a mediocre knockoff of Fallout 1 and 2. At its core the game is a squad based, isometric RPG with a similar control scheme to Infinity Engine games such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, but it tries to focus almost entirely on large scale combat over the lore, exploration and storytelling that made the original two Fallout games so enjoyable. You generally use the same mechanics, weapons and abilities found in Fallout 2, and even can switch between real-time and the ""classic"" turn based combat, but the end result feels like a poorly balanced mess. My major complaints:1. Inability to switch from real time to turn based mode outside of combat gives encamped enemies way too much of an advantage2. Movement range in turn based mode is too small for the size of the maps you play on3. Vehicles die too easily and are annoying to control4. Some mission objectives are stupidly vague and NPCs don't give useful context cluesIf it's not clear already, ""needlessly slowing down the pace of the game"" seems to be a reoccuring theme here. But there are other major areas the game has problems with:5. The plot and characters are generic and unmemorable, and besides that, aren't even considered canon6. Most of the skills outside of combat are uselessDespite these issues I'm not saying this game is all terrible. Being able to use cover and crouch is a cool concept that adds a layer of complexity to the combat system that the original Fallout games did not have. I like being able to play as other races like Deathclaws or Ghouls, they all have their own playstyle quirks that make them feel interesting and distinct. I also like the general concept of epic scale battles against heavily fortified groups of enemies- it's just that the concept was poorly tested and poorly executed. Because this game is not considered canon you are really not missing out on much as a Fallout fan if you decide not to play through it, but if you do I suggest not trying to ramp up the difficulty mode so you can stick with real-time combat (and thus minimize the pacing issues) as much as possible.

												For some reason, this game never got the credit it deserves. Maybe it was its huge departure from the classic Fallout 1 and 2, maybe it was the tile based graphics, which even at release seemed fairly dated. Either way, this is a capable turn-based strategy game with a good bit of depth, RPG like character progression (via perks and traits), decent story, and satisfying gore. I picked this up on Steam just to see if it would play on the Surface and it worked perfectly. I picked this up for $2.49 and got a good 45-50 hours of gameplay. That's a great value and was as satisfying 10 years after release as the day I picked it when it came out.			"

												While it's a bit different than Fallout 1 & 2, Tactics is incredibly addicting and one can easily sink 40 hours into a single playthrough. The amount of content is great, the character creation and leveling system is comprehensive, and the missions are tactically challenging. I would highly recommend Fallout Tactics.			"

												The over all game is enjoyable, a major improvement on the system of fallout 1&2, and has, a some what weak story of scattered missions, but rewarding none the less. It was said to have a steam supported multiplayer, with a sever and all, but that is all for naught. DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER. But other than that, once you get the hang of it, you will come to enjoy it, as I did.			"

												Undervalued game of Fallout series, absolutely love this game.After very familiar character creation process you are placed into role of new recruit of Brotherhood of Steel. Unlike in other Fallout titles where you only control your character, in Fallout Tactics you control your squad on different missions in wasteland. Encounters are different and over missions you meet more difficult opponents, from standard bandits (raiders) to super mutant and creatures like deathclaws to super robots.If you like strategy games, especially turn based ones with quite a lot action I would recommand this game to everyone.Also don't forget to activate secret mission in Springfield before you arrive to Bunker Gamma.

												All round good game. If you are a fan of the FALLOUT series then this game is a must have for your collection. If you have not bought a FALLOUT game before then please don't buy this one. I recommend buying FALLOUT 3 first then take it from there.Graphics are simple but works well for this mini FALLOUT game.Sound effects are good however it will get a little repetitive after long play.Game play is relatively simple throughout and easy to understand. There are in-game tutorials before you begin. Control's can get a little awkward in high risk combat situations, but after a bit of practice, that is easily remedied. This version of FALLOUT has  a linear based storyline and is not as open world as the other games.This is my first review, I hope it helped.			"

												This is definitaly one of the Best of the ""Fallout"" series. Instead of being another RPG, or one of the new shooter games, this is a tactical squad based game, that tests your skills of planning, timing, and organization. You need to prove yourself as a cunning squad leader, who can lead his or her soldiers into battle, and fight to victory. You won't just be fighting raiders and mutants, there's threats in this fallout that have never been seen before, and if you're good enough, will never be seen again.  The levels in this game all seem hand crafted and thought out, almost like a puzzle, and each character you meet will be unique and flavorful. I completely recommend this game to people who enjoy tactical video games, and to those who want to see more of the fallout universe.        Oh and another thing: SOMEONE MAKE A SEQUEL ALREADY!!!!!!!!!! I REALLY DON""T CARE WHO AS LONG AS IT'S A GOOD GAME!			"

												Whether or not you should buy this game really depends on if you know how to enjoy it, and if you think you would enjoy it playing the intended way. This game is obviously dated, and has a lot of bugs, but they're usually concentrated towards a specific area (an example being that turn based mode is terrible compared to real time). For that reason, it's recommended to use a guide, and luckily, I found a really good guide that should help really anyone, if you're a newcomer to any fallout game or a Fallout veteran and anything in between, so I'll link it at the end of the review. For judgement on how this game stands on its own, ignoring comparisons to Fallout 2 (which is actually why most people dislike this game, they didn't get what they wanted, which was Fallout 3 and instead got this combat game), this game isn't really tactical, but it's pretty fun when played as a hack-and-slash sort of playstyle. Playing it with even more specialization than Fallout 2 and 1 is an important part of the game, and makes for a fun sort of roleplaying with how you use weapons and what sort of fighter you are. This gives good replayability, along with decent combat , more or less point-and-click but with some planning and all that.Overall, this game isn't bad for what it is, but you need to know what it is to decide if it's something you'd enjoy. The game's kind of for a niche crowd and a lot of people don't understand that when they're buying the game, and that prevents them from enjoying it. As stated before, I recommend that you look at this guide, as it tells you the most fun way to go about this game, depending on if that playstyle's enjoyable to you.Cool guide on fun for this game: 


9 tips to enjoying Fallout Tactics 
A Guide for Fallout Tactics

												Don't let the low time on record fool you, I've dumped many hours of my life into this game.I first played this game at the ripe young age of 13, and I hated it for not being Fallout 1 or Fallout 2. It was only after my enlistment, in the United States Marine Corps infantry, that I truly came to fall in love with Fallout Tactics.Reasons this game is awesome.Reason number 1 - Voice acting by Gunnery Sergeant R. Lee Ermy. Oo ♥♥♥♥in' rahh gunney!Reason number 2 - Voice acting by mother ♥♥♥♥ing Gunnery Sergeant R. Lee Ermy. Nothing gets your♥♥♥♥♥♥harder than Gunney Ermey giving you a mission brief!Reason number 3 - Setting up a final protective line, FPL, to cut your enemies in half with a Ma Deuce, i.e. a Browning,      fully automatic, .50 caliber machine gun, firing at the cyclic rate of 500 widows per minute.... kill bodies, eat babiesReason number 4 - Build the ground element of a Marine Corps air ground task force, MAGTF, this is your ♥♥♥♥in' war, wage it however you see fit, sir.... EDIT - There will unfortunately not be an air element to your MAGTF, so do a good ♥♥♥♥in' job on the ground.Reason number 5 - Establish a well oiled, well greased, killing machine of a squad. You need a charismatic squad leader, you, google Fallout Tactics perks for why. (benifiting the squad is better than benefiting yourself) An 0331, Machine Gunner/heavy weapons expert, for supressive fire and severely ♥♥♥♥in'♥♥♥♥♥♥up. An 0351, assaultman, for kicking in doors with a shotgun at the ready. An 0326, Reconaissance Marine, for gathering intel on your enemy. A Navy corpsman, Doc, to patch you up when♥♥♥♥♥♥goes bad. An 0311, Riflemen, Grunt, Killer, Baby Eater, Life Taker, Murderous, Evil Sum ♥♥♥♥♥, Amphibious ♥♥♥♥in' warrior,♥♥♥♥♥♥down the neck of a decapitated corpse, god damned life taking man. SIDE NOTE - The latter description of the 0311 really really applies to any Marine Corps MOS beginning with the numbers ""03"".sorry 0341's, go play cards at some other FOB.... 0352's, your in CAAT platoon, which means your on the .50, so your in. And my brother is an 0352, so I like ya'll.Reason number 6 - Men run faster than women, because ♥♥♥♥ equality. This is a god damn combat simulation. Strap a 100 lb. ILBE to a woman's back, and another to a man's back, and see who moves ♥♥♥♥in' quickerReason number 7 - Orchestrating an ambush feels, and sounds, like Chopin's Nocturne in E Flat Major. It's god damn beautiful when you cut several men/super mutants/robots in half. The cacophony of machine gun fire fuses into a melodic battle hymn, as you see your enemies crumble before you.Reason number 8 - Enfilade fire, when the long axis of the target coincides with the long axis of the beaten zone. the machine gunners wet dream. Google it, understand it, use it.Reason number 9 -  Voice acting by Gunney Ermey....Reason number 10 - You get a ♥♥♥♥in' tank....			"

												The Brotherhood Of Steel wants you! Whether you want to join or not! If you didn't like the limited companion controls of Fallout and the slightly improved version in Fallout 2, you'll love it this time around! You have full control over each companion along side your own character. The game play is slightly RTS, (called Continuous Turned Based, CTB in the settings), but still fully uses action points to dictate attacks and movements. The story is as good as the first two previous Fallouts but lacks alot of retro 1950 technology and focuses more on combat. Best part of this game in my opinion is: VEHICLES!!! This is the only Fallout game with fully driveable vehicles. And because this is the Steam version of this game, (Not technically but still) you get a special raider vehicle that was only available in pre-orders for all your Mad Max fantasies. Now get out there and kick some raider♥♥♥♥♥soldier!!! Notice: If you have trouble with turrets, give them drugs and they'll explode.			"

												This game is underrated as fock, the gameplay [to me] is maginally better than the first two, and it's basically hours of gameplay, because the missions are long af, but that's a good thing, it also has some pretty badass weapons uniqe to it's self, and how can i not love a game that takes place in my hometown. Don't be turned off by it's old look, it is wonderful, and the cut-scenes and loading scenes are fully rendered in 3-d, and the faces look realistic, something very hard to capture in 3-d, i nut for this game, definately a good buy.

												Pros:Classic fallout look/feelClassic turn-based tactical gameplay with the option to play real timePurely combat oriented--no base management (If that's your thing)Interesting mix of RPG character management and tactical combat (Requires you to consider non-combat skills like repair, lock-picking, etc.)Mission approach can adjust outcome (eg. SPOILER: A few missions in you are required to investigate an abandoned underground base below a “tribal” village. At one point, you have to pull a switch to access a second portion of the base. When you pull the switch, it disengages the bases internal defenses and engages the external defenses after a 10 second timer. This has the consequence of killing almost all of the villagers. I realised after the mission that the 10 seconds gives you just enough time to run a character through the internal portion, afterwhich you can have another character disengage the switch, thus defending the villagers above ground!)Cons:Traveling between missions can be a huge pain if you don't have a high outdoors skill (dragging you into tedious fights)No base management (If that's your thing!)Vehicle movement is horrible!There does not appear to be an option to display a hex-grid for character movement. This can be quite annoying when you're trying to place your squad behind cover			"

												Although ""Tactics"" is built purely around combat, it's no less challenging than its isometric RPG progenitors. You will probably die a lot, and you will probably reload a lot if losing a squad member permanently is unacceptable to you. Mistakes are punished swiftly (and often brutally), and trying to just blast your way through is rarely a workable approach.As a special note, be sure to save often and incrementally. I nearly made it to the end of the game, but was prevented when a defeated enemy blocked the only route to my goal. Unfortunately, I had made my only save just after the enemy was felled, which would have required me to roll back to the beginning of the area to try again. It had been such an exhausting process to get to that point that I just opted to stop playing. (Having put over 60 hours into the game, I figured that I had seen most of the show anyway.)Anyway - this title is a classic example of game design, and definitely worth checking out. It won't ""nursemaid"" you, but that's part of what made it the experience that it was.			"

												One of the wierder Fallout games. You create your character as usual, and then you can choose up to 5 pre-generated members from dozens of applicants to your Brotherhood squad. Then you complete missions in different locations in linear order, facing different kinds of enemies in certain areas. If you complete your tasks flawlessly, you are promoted and able to recruit better members to your squad. The game offers freedom of either turn-based or realtime combat. Of course the game has stability issue, but the most annoying part is travelling on the world map. Even with highly skilled outdoorsman the game finds random encounters every second or two, and depending on your skill you may skip the battles, but if youre not skilled outdoorsman youre stuck fighting on random encounters. Its not the greatest game in fallout series, but i suppose its playable.			"

												Okay my least fave of the Fallout originals, if this game can even fall into that description but it is before Bethesda Oblivionised the series. Anyhow... the game does remind me of the cool Fallout 1 and 2, but with far more action and really REALLY shredded story, it is very linear with very few ways to alter the ending. You run a team of 1-6 Characters based on the Fallout 1-2 SPECIAL set up, only the first character is possible to make the rest start out as defaults and you must choose them and improve them or change them into what you want. I prefer to be the Heavy gunner on my own character as it is definatly the weapon that is easiest to cause friendly fire and keeping the rest on single sniping and short range burst to make choke points and a medic with mid-range burst weapons.Now the game can be turned into fallout 1-2 mode, where action points are used on your turn or remain in a sort of fast forward everyone gun down everyone mode which can be highly deadly in the later parts of the game. In the Start however you will enjoy having a 6 man team with hunting rifles sniping the crap out of the enemy before they reach you and it goes fast, but when 3 hover droids with rocket launchers pop up you kinda go.... ZOMG I iz deadz. and it is true, not even power armor can guarantee survivability against a barrage of rockets fired every 2 seconds or so.... in those moments the Fallout 1-2 mode will save your well toasted behind. It strikes me that it might be this mode that made Bethesda make their own version of it for fallout 3 because it is very similar to it, you use your AP up and then it is your next guy in rotations turn, he uses his AP up and then it is the enemies turn... this does give your team a very good chance to kill whatever they are fighting with a few well placed mid-range bursts or Grenadeds.Even if you cheat and make your main guy immortal and a 1 man army with unlimited AP there are missions that requires a team of people to succede because the targets heal each other and are spread across the map, unless all die at the same time it is impossible to succede. The worst downside of the game is however the overland map that is annoying as hell, random encounters happens way to often, and is seriously lacking in usability, you tend to use more resources killing things than what you get.Bottomline: story is meh okay and gameplay is meh okay. Only a true fan of the series would like it enough to beat it and feel that they did not waste time, but as it follows with Fallout 1 and 2 in a bunble it will be worth it.			"

												Not the Fallout we are used to but it will do, BIG TIME! The name says it: Tactics, and all this game revolves on is tactics. Basing your gameplay on up to 6 NPCs you can use to ambush, flank or full on attack just about anything. It will take you about 20 minutes or so to get used to it, but after that you can blow up everyone and everything (yeah util you reach the robots). Once you reach 70% of the game you are faced with the robots and this is where all the tactics comes handy because trust me if you don't watch you asses you're gonna die, A LOT!			"

												Fun game, nice that you can use either turn-based or continuous play. A good selection of squad mates, I usually have a tough time deciding who to take. My only complaint is there's not enough missions. I really like the Fallout series, have played since the first one came out and this is a fine game. It's different that the rest, but it's fun!			"

												Probably one of my favorite games of all time. Playing Wasteland 2 is great, but I'd say Fallout Tactics was the better game and its 14 years old! R. Lee Ermy voices your boss! Seriously though, the game mechanics where way ahead of its time and the Fallout humor is in full force.			"

												Fallout Tactics has a special place in my gaming library. I probably have about a dozen play throughs under my belt since it was originally released and I still keep coming back to it. Sure it's a little buggy and poorly optimized and doesn't have half the depth of Fallout 1 or 2 but it's just such a well constructed tactical game.The real-time-turn-based system is so well balanced and executed it has to be experience to truly appreciate it. The art and aesthetic is 100% Fallout in every way with amazing attention to detail. The game world and story line is huge and well thought out with balanced map design and tons of little interactive set pieces in every encounter. You can play this game different every time as even the smallest mistakes or extra achievements in a mission have an effect on the final outcome.It's a beautiful end of the isometric Fallout games and it may not be a ""real"" Fallout game in some senses it definitely still has the soul.

												A fun game, though nothing on any of the others for story (in fact its only part canon) it has the best combat (imho) of the older fallouts, with the option of real time or turn based combat. Certainly worth getting in the fallout collection (I would have recommended to get the GOG version due to 0 drm but sadly it is no longer on their store, the steam version will have to do). I've played less than 4 hours on the steam version but I own the GOG version which I have played for much longer.			"

												Its a solid game! It plays like a good version of fallout 1 or 2 without the story. But there isnt much in the way of tactics since the only way to really succeed is to shoot everyone from a distance and hope that no one gets too close. Its a bit tedious, the pathfinding is not good and its easy to screw up if you forgot to turn off aggressive stance. The weapons are unbalanced with most weapons being inferior, i used the hunting rifle which you get at the beginning pretty much most of the game because is has good range, good damage, lots of ammo and only a hand full of weapons are better. If you use anything but single shot you will most likely kill your team because friendly fire is inevitable. So give everyone a hunting rifle and it becomes a cakewalk. The game is fun even though all you do is shoot stuff, unfortunately the shooting gets repetetive and the relpay value is very low because all the enemies are stationary and there is no random spawn system. Its a good thing the enemy variety is good. Its basically a dumb shooting spree but a good one!			"

Following a group/squad in the Brotherhood, you take out Bandit camps with the same gameplay style as Fallout 1 and 2.Just like the title, the game requires strategy and tactics to survive. There is also friendly fire in the game so it's easy to accidently shoot your other teammates that don't use/have guns.I also noticed that the introduction announcer is R. Lee Ermey (known from the movie Full Metal Jacket).Pretty decent game, if you liked the originals and wanted a different game style.5/10 "

												The game is a bit touch and go for me. Yeah, it's old, dated, and nostalgic and to be honest the last part of those three is all that really holds me to the game. It's not for everyone given the snail-like slow (redundant) pace of things and how god forsakenly long it takes for the AI to complete its turn. The actual mechanics are pretty fun to mess around with (prone, crouch, overwatch, etc) and it makes for some unique mission runs. Still, suffice it to say that while I never made it past the 5th mission due to becoming bored with its pace, I still manage to find a small deal of fun when I can tolerate it for more than 30 minutes at a time. I would honestly only suggest grabbing this due to nostalgia. Even though I don't have much time in it or play it as much as I'd like to, it just.. hits home for me.			"

												First thing - I am more mixed in terms of feelings about this game. I loved Fallout 1 and 2 and I really wanted to love Fallout Tactics. It was different than previous games and have had some interesting concepts. Overall it was solid piece of game for which this review should be possitive. But it's not. Reason why is the way this game behaves on modern stronger machines. As long as you are not on world map everything is fine. Everything works correctly and exactly as I remebered it when I was playing that game ~10 years ago. What is the problem with map you might ask? Well it's simple - encounter rate is somehow related to your CPU clock or ammount of FPS.. Between Briar Woods (First Location) and Bunker Alpha I have had 15~20 random encounters. For some it might be a lot of fun but for me at that point of time it was tedious and annoying. Sorry Fallout Tactics - I will play you when I will revive my old PII/32 MB ram PC some time in future, For now if you have got modern PC - buy it at your own risk or look for mod or something that hopefully fixes that issue.

												Fallout Tactics: BoS is a very solid game set in the Fallout universe. There's nifty tactical combat and plenty of interesting builds for characters as they level up. I loved it when it first came out.However, this version of Fallout will not run well on a modern machine. You will most likely have to play in windowed mode, which is a half-hearted compromise so that the game can at least run; however, it's filled with graphical glitches and unexplainable stuttering.Great game, the mechanics itself haven't aged out, but it hasn't been adequately updated to run smoothly on modern computer architecture and OSes.

												Fallout Tactics is a very focused squad based version of Fallout.You lose alot of the exploration options of Fallout as well as alot of non combative ways to resolve problems. As consequence it is less about losing yourself in the world as it is about kicking the worlds butt.If you like XCOM there is a very good chance you will enjoy this game. For that matter it is probably closer to Jagged Alliance then XCOM but both are great games. The character leveling system is particularly good and challenges you to balance the diffrent skills so that you have a good medic and a good laser guy for example. Unlike other games of the genre there are melee characters (if you permit) on your squad that allow for some stealth elements of the game.Unlike say XCOM the enemy doesn't neccasirly know you are on the map. I like this alot, it is really cool to move your units around a building, in an attempt to prepare for a perfect assult. It is even cooler to have characters sneaking around disabling mines and slitting the throat of a lonely soldier. Dated graphics but defintely worth the time if you like XCOM or Jagged Alliance.			"

												Fallout Tactics is a spinoff of the Fallout series that manages to not only completely change the story but gameplay as well. The biggest change comes in the speed of combat; there are modes in this game now that makes combat freaking mad fast. Rather than controlling one unit, you can now control Squad members which significantly increase combat depth. In return all “choice” in the rpg aspect of this game is gone, npc dialog interaction doesn’t exist. I find this game to be closer to the Commandos series than Fallout, which is not necessarily a bad thing but if you’re playing this out of love of the first two Fallouts, stop now. Gameplay wise, this game is superior by far. Story and immersion wise, this game is nowhere near the level of Fallout 1 and 2.			"

												Just like the first 2 fallout games without all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Building a perfect character no longer matters as much as there aren't very many CHR, speech, etc checks and you have a team from that start that each specialize. This is fallout with almost all combat with a few more tactical things like crouching and proning. The story, enviorenments, and characters are worse than any other fallout game, though. In that aspect it's mainly basic character archetypes or basic fallout fare for story and enviorenments. It's a good game, but only if you like the combat of the original fallouts. Even then, they still have the option to switch that up, with active-time combat or a squad turn based system. You also can (and often have to) switch weapons, heal, and generally manage your items.Oh yeah, and there's multiplayer.			"

												Fallout Tactocs: Brotherhood of steel is a spinoff title from the Fallout franchise. It's not a regular roleplaying game, it has the option of either real time or turn based. For the true Elitest playthrough it is recommended that you put it on turn based and put the difficulty all the way up, if you can't beat the game like this on your first playthrough then this game is not for you.

I come up to an enemy with a shotgun, try the same strategy.

Lee Ermey, the notorious Drill Sargeant from Full Metal Jacket among many other appearances on Film and TV.  Great game as well.  You can put units on sentry mode, but set a threshold for % to hit before they fire.  Setting it to 95% is like saying:  Don't shoot 'til you can see the whites of their eyes!a 1999 game, but if you like gameplay and substance over graphics and have never played this game you're missiong out!

												5/10This game starts off ok and gets worse rather quickly. The story was one of fallout games best qualities and this one is rather uniteristing and predictable. Gamplay becomes rather boreing and reptitive. Yes, you can play as Deathclaws, but good luck going up against Supermutants with LMGs. If your team members weren't so expendable, i would have stoped playing a wile ago. So, it has the gamplay style of Fallout 1 & 2 without the good story witch is the best quality of those two. If i had to come up with a tag-line for this game it would be, 'could have almost been made by Todd Howard himself'.			"

												Back in the old days this was a masterpiece. Sadly enough, it aged not that well. The turn-based single-player mode (the only one I'm interested in) is nearly unplayable. Modern titles (see XCOM) where the maximum distance and other quality of life hints are given, have spoiled my expections. It's very tedious and uncomfortable to go back to an old UI such as this. It's sad because I've always loved all classical Fallout titles but I have to be honest. I can't enjoy this anymore.			"

												This game is a mess.I've had several issues with it and plenty are technical issues.The game doesn't run well on newer operation systems and if you want to play fullscreen on windows 8, you'll have to do some glitching in order for it too work.But even then you'll get tearing, lagging and textures popping in and out. Talking about popping in and out, if you're in the open desert and as you walk, enemies will spawn right behin where you just walked. This is especially annoying when you want to clear rooms and suddenly find out that enemies spawned as you left the room, even worse in large areas where the objective is to kill everyone and you have to backtrack to look for those that spawned after you left.Unlike previous Fallout games, you can't see what's in a room when you're not in it. That's fine, if it wasn't so buggy. Enemies will appear and reappear in the room after several seconds of you standing inside of it, you might even just stand right infront of a enemy and have to wait for it to appear so you can kill it.If you're in it for Fallout lore, remember that this game is only semi-cannon and also that there is barely any Fallout here. Sure there are few references to Fallout here and there, many of which are minor and uninteresting.If you're here for the Squad-Based Combat, go elsewhere. Any interactions i've had with the rest of the squad has been unpleasant and annoying. If you're playing in turn-based mode, you'll find that the AI's turns take an insane amount of time, oddly enough, if there are no AIs in the area it still takes alot of time. I playing in real time mode and found that my teammates are more likely to kill themselves and me, rather than the enemy. I abandoned them and played mostly solo, which was more like the other Fallout games and alot more enjoyable.The story seemed like it could be promising but the intro after you start a new game is laughably bad, so much that it's painful to watch. The general, whom you get your missions from, is an awful tough guy cliche. I wish he was muted so i didn't have to listen to him everytime i enter a new mission area. The voice acting is pretty bad and the writing doesn't help either. I especially hate the real world character pictures used for all the characters in the game. It screams low production and i think that's what this game is.Most of the story is told through a picture book with narration but that only happens when major event occur and is honestly the most interest part of the whole thing.Vehicle combat is a thing, it's unresponsive, the vehicle gets stuck, doesn't go where you want it to go and is very buggy. All in all, it's a terrible experience and i'd much rather just not do those missions.I don't intend on finishing this game, it's not worth it. And i think if you want to do yourself a big favor, i would say don't buy this game.			"

												""I really wanted to like this game..."". This is how great many negative reviews start. Before I begin to point out why I am mostly disappointed with Tactics in the range of fresh impressions, I would like to mention I have played the original Fallout and its sequel for a long time before I joined STEAM, enough to get accustomed to them. When I saw Tactics, at first I though the graphics are acceptable to the point that if an utopian Fallout 3 was done with these visuals - yet in the manner of two earlier editions in such aspects as gameplay, plot and hex-based mechanics - I would be satisfied.Unfortunately, soon I learned that within given outlook and layout things as if blend into background, the overall picture seems blurry, images of objects are too small next to being hardly distinctive - and I know how to change resolutions, as well as hopefully my eyesight is fair. Personally, I ultimately find the graphical side unfriendly.I had quite a laugh when I saw that the main characters hair, skin and peripheral elements are customizable in terms of colour. I painted my doll with light-greenish when it comes to skin, black when it comes to hair and underwear-pink when it comes to armor and other stuff. I named it UGLUK, made it a kamikaze-heavyhanded melee outdoorsman-stealth specialist. UGLUK is quite effective in bludgeoning and looting, what this game is all about, just like DIablo 2. ""Tactics"" is only in the title. Still, I think I would prefer the second one mentioned product in given category, nevertheless have big sympathy and thus expectations of Fallout and post-nuclear themes.The game appears to be thought by developers as swift and intuitive, but it fails here shortly. Neither ""continous-turn-based"" aka real-time - nor turn based combat are good. The first one is too rapid or loose to be able to carry out simultaneous complex operations within its conditions - as if these were needed at all, but still. Lack of the pause-and-command button is significantly bothersome. The other indicated combat mode feels secondary and slow - since the game is one big combat phase - next to being more difficult.SPECIAL system looks complicated in comparison to the dumbed-down battlescape controls. It has been difficult for me to get into this aspect of Tactics. One accidental wrong click and the turn is lost for an entire squad, along with some equipment waste. Perhaps this ""sensitivity"" was to be one of the traits of the games ""swiftness"", unfortunately it is just detrimental. Besides, many options available through key shortcuts are unfeatured on the controls panel, which seem unhandy, especially if to recall the clearness and composure known from the classical two editions. SPECIAL is unproportional for a play that was supposed to be easily graspable. It carries lots of little parameters and tweaks to get into while commanding a raging squad in a run-for-the-hotkey match. The system ought to have been dumbed-down as well, but if it was, the game would become even more like Diablo sequel. But you know, perhaps Diablo 2 is a good pattern after all - at least in some cases - since it achieved a major success, unlike Fallout Tactics?I already mentioned the hex-based battlescape mechanics - characteristic for the two earlier Fallout releases - that the reviewed product lacks. With the actual Tactics solution, it is usually a question where the character will ultimately stand when clicked to set off. Besides, movement is cumbersome in execution - and shines in this regard when addressed to an entire squad. The action - once initiated - is hard to stop. There is a hotkey to cease an ordered procedure, nevertheless it aids to ""run for the hotkey"" challenge, which the game is full of, especially in ""real time"" combat mode.Controls, ways of characters responsivity, battlescape mechanics, adjustment of the system, image and visual clarity, legacy - instead of fluently working together for a smooth play, fall onto one another as if in a massive carcrash, creating an obstacle to enjoy the product that otherwise could have been pretty decent. I can hardly get rid of the sense of irony.Cumbersome and unhandy - disrecommended.PS. I am okay with linear plot - just like in case of Diablo 2. At least it should perhaps keep some stable mediocre level - better this than poor execution of overambitious goals.			"

												Fallout Tactics is not, as many seems to think, the third fallout game. It is a spin-off, set in the time between the two original Fallouts and focusing almost entirely on the one aspect of it's predecessors that was almost universally disliked, squad combat.As you head off into the wasteland one more time you will find some comfort in the familiar. The SPECIAL system is still in place and allows you to customize both yourself and the squad with which you are now required to do battle beside. Memories of NPC burstfiring and having Marcus in your team at all can quickly be dismissed however as your entire squad is completely under your control this time.Battles play out in either the regular turn based mode which with a big team, big maps and lots of enemies make the game dreadfully slow at times, or a pseudo-realtime mode that lets everyone act out their turns in concert with each other. The real time mode might make some of the smaller battles fly past quicker but as it was obviously never part of the core mechanics it comes with a whole slew of problems that makes it unusable when faced with bigger enemy parties, most notably each character will only perform one action at a time and will then stand around afterwards, waiting to be told to fire off his gun for a second time.The great writing of the old Fallout's make a return, although in a more condensed format and lots of the over the top humor from Fallout 2 is present as well making the non-combat segments of the game quite enjoyable, the non-linearity and the choice and consequence system from those games are not present however.Graphically the game feels dated, a long time has passed since the original Fallout and not much has changed since then. The soundtrack still contains some gems and the game does succeed in places at re-creating that Fallout fell. Those instances are unfortunately quite rare.All in all Fallout Tactics is a game that takes too much away from what is tried and true. It tries to create a new experience in a medium with which it has little familiarity and the many rookie mistakes shines through all too much. This makes this a hard game to recommend, even for a die-hard Fallout fan such as myself.			"

												Look, i know its fall out and you really want to play it, but just go to gog or some torrent site and download the old version. The steam version doesnt work properly and the screen doesnt display colors properly along with lots of tearing and framerate lag.  This is a common issue with the steam version fixable with a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  I dont pay steam to sell me games that require fixing with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and mods, so im giving this game a bad review.  Buy it, just not from steam, because when your copy doesnt work (like mine), youll open a thread about it, after making ANOTHER steam account to post said thread, only to have no one ever respond to your issue.  A similar issue occured with my copy of Jade Empire: Imperial Edition, or w.e it is.  Still doenst work, still have an open thread about it, still cant play it.  Valve still has my money.  They're lucky Dota 2 exists.			"

												Very fun tactical combat and many fun weapons and items. Unfortunately the social skills and dialog trees which made the previous Fallouts stand out have been gutted and many non-combat skills and character attributes are borderline useless. I think the first few levels are the most interesting and fun... but then the pace seems to slow and the story becomes muddled and boring... not until the last few missions does the pace pick back up and become interesting again. Worth fooling around with but too flawed, in my opinion, to recommend.			"

												Probably was a really good game when it was created but this game has not stood the test of time. The game is very slow placed, glitchy, and the controls are hard to manage. You have to go through at least one menu to complete any task like pick a lock or go into stealth. You cannot compare weapons; was unable to get the stats of any weapon unless going into combat. They made many improvements to bring Fallout 3. Good back story.			"

Now im not going to completely blame it on the game, but the poor controlls, frusterating ai, and the fact that my guys couldn't hit the front side of a barn, didn't help. I had to search for the controlls, and when I finnaly had them memorized, my units would not listen, and couldnt hit anything. I do not recomend buying this game. I'm sure once you get the hang of it, it's an entertaining game. It is not s omething you should put your time and effort into.			"

												the game is ok at best with your squad being phisically incable of basic task without you holding there hands. if you like to micro mange then you may like the game. Although your selected team will be incable of doing anything even if you hold there hands as they will miss more shots then they hit in any combat situathion. I have had situathions where every member of my team was beaten to death as the where in cable of shooting for them selfs and missed when ever they did shoot. Also it is imposible to get anywhere on the mapas you run into contacts every five seconds it becomes annoying when you have no ammo and no caps to buy any and your squad is not fast enoung to run from most eneimes such as dogs and scropians will catch you if you run where as raiders wil just shoot you in the back. Even if all your team is in sneak mode it will make little to no difefrence so hidding and waiting for a patrol to pass also nearly undoable.			"

												Now, I do enjoy this game quite a bit, but the fact remains that they've never patched some of the game-breaking bugs that can get you stuck when revisiting a special encounter - such as Bazaar Day or Phil the Nuka Cola Dude. These bugs nearly swayed my recommendation, but it doesn't quite ruin the whole game unless you're a one-save kind of person.Another issue is the slow-paced combat when using the turn-based options, while the continuous turn-based isn't so bad, but it has its drawbacks. For instance, you might be moving two separate groups in an area and might forget another group for long enough for an enemy patrol to come by and open fire on them.Traveling on the world map is another bad experience due to the frequent, almost constant barrage of random encounters. This makes it absolutely vital to level somebody's Outdoorsman skill to 100 or more to give you the option to skip them and continue your journey.It's a decent game, but it has a few nagging drawbacks that keep it from comparing to the first two Fallout games. If you play it, keep these things in mind, as they're quite frustrating at times.			"

												This game's checklist:* fallout style graphics* guns* explosives* cars (or one car)* tanks (or one tank)* tribals (even playable)* deathclaws (even playable)* robots (even playable)You are a recruit for the brotherhood of steel. You directly command a group of ragtag soldiers that do the dirty work for the brotherhood. This is not a pure fallout game, since its addition to the story seems less original. But it is set in the same universe, so to speak, in the fallout wasteland.It is not the same thing as fallout, so beware. It reminds more of x-com than of fallout 1 or 2.Story: 5/10Gameplay: 9/10Guns: 10/10Bad rats is getting competition! "

												Before the days of steam, I probably spent 500 hours in fallout tactics. It\'s a lot better than people give it credit for. It might have aged somewhat as mechanics like cover aren\'t clear, but it\'s a real golden oldie. The 5th mission, Quincy is burned in my memory forever. It\'s a stealth mission that I\'ve done probably 30 times and is one of the best missions in any game I\'ve played.			"

												Not gonna lie, I had hoped for more of a ""Free-play"" aspect to this game, however that appears not to be the case, I had bought this due to it's visual proximity to Baldur's Gate, and the fact that this was a Fallout version. I do however feel this game is somewhat overly difficult, as in most encounters I need to save after every round so that in the event I die, I don't have to start over. Not too many issues other than those.			"

												This was actually my entry point into Fallout and I came to love this game as well as the series. I personally came to terms with the limitations of the game's combat system. The lack of a pause to issue orders is tough, but a six man squad doesn't require the most complex battle planning and I liked to sneak up on bad guys and ambush them so it was easy to set everyone to not shoot and then shoot all at the same time. Also, you can save at any time so it's forgiving.It's a favorite of mine and I bought it on steam again just to play through the first levels again.			"

												Very good game, spent hundreds of hours offline on this, don't regret a single one. The story is long enough to keep you entertained for hours, and the graphics are still satifying.The only bad point is that there are no side quests, and exploring the vast map is pointless (you just find funny but useless places)			"

												So many guns, vehicles, traps, campers, vehicles (+Enclave Mod), easter eggs, skills, perks, characters, and tactics to execute in real time or turn based. Except, its not well optimized for turn-based combat compared to previous fallout titles. Has high learning curve, micromanagement, and using burst fire in tight formations or on enemies that penetrated the lines can lead to friendly fire. Another note, encounter rate can be lowered with 100 pts in Outdoorsman skill or reading one of the published guides for Fallout Tactics on steam.			"

												Like wasteland 2 but with less of the narative hoops to jump through and pure brotherhood of steel fascism! Send eager young men and women to die as you wage a war of attrition across the wasteland and gradualy make use of the rest of the trash as you battle tribals who use deathclaws as troops, supermutants, and finaly terminator style robots, and as you make progress and lose you best friends, make friends with your defeated enemies as you recuit those who aren't murdered and crucified for resisting you and your order.This game takes the gameplay of Fallout and ramps it up to a squad based level. While this can be played entirely turn based, you have to learn how to play it in real time. While you might ask, whats the point of action points? you can still have to worry about those, and it become somehow a more realistic depiction of how action points works, as the more Agile warrior can gun down enemies faster (imagine changing targets faster) Recuitment works as you gain faction rep with the BOS (the only faction you gain rep with..) and as you progress missions you have the oppertunity to recruit different races/factions, which will be able to soak up bullets better than other recruits.You also get vehicles which is basically having the ability to put units in a wagon and have them move and shoot at the same time with the benifit of a large chunck of HPHowever, there aren't as many narative actions like in Fallout or Wasteland 2 for you to have choices or explore- The game focuses almost exlusively on tactics- killing people and protecting YOUR player character, with an XCOM esque killing of you teamates as only the PC is require to live through the game			"

												This isn't much of a review but this game is simply (in my opinion I suppose) THE, greatest game of all eternity.Sure.... it leaves alot to be desired but no game is totally perfect although FoT comes really close.I would do nearly anything to get a sequel of at least equal awesome so maybe that can be enough to convince someone else.
