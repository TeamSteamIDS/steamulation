												my only take-away from this thread is:It's far better to pre-release games as alpha, and incorporate many sales to attract a wide-player (tester) base.  This game was released in August 2012, so by the time I encountered the bug I saw, it had already been released over half a year.  I was playing what was promoted as a released non-alpha, non-beta, polished, clean product.By telling players ""this is just alpha code"" - all sorts of bugs are forgiven.  It just changes the whole tone, and it also scares players like me away.  I don't want to be anybody's alpha or beta tester and pay for it unless the game is extremely compelling.  That's just my personal approach as a consumer.So I don't know if my review is a troll.  If anyone asked me ""do you recommend this game"" - my review is exactly what comes to mind when I see this game, especially when I visit the forums and get that dirty message in red at the top.  It was a power play by the dev ""you didn't follow protocol.  Nananana.""  Or at least that's what it felt like for me getting banned.Today I played 2 multiplayer games, and I didn't see the issue that had happened before.  It's quite possible that the issue has been addressed.And there's really no point in dwelling on ""here's what so and so did wrong"".  I'd rather find a solution, and for me that solution is, it's much safer to call a game alpha than go through this sort of mess.--------------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ------------------------------------You have been permanently banned from all Tower Wars discussions.You were banned by a Tower Wars developer.Reason: ""Not following protocol to submit a bug report.""This is how this developer treats customers.  If the customer runs into a problem with the product, ban them from the forums.  Permanently.  Which leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth.  I can't recommend a game by a dev who treats people like this.    And for the gory details: my mouse would lock up attached to an object in the middle of games.  I couldn't     go to the menus, NOTHING.  Multiplayer games would log me as having quit the game, when it was a bug.      Of course NOBODY else saw this bug.  Well it turned out, eventually, that I figured out (no thanks to the     devs) that this only happened when my video settings were maxed out (monitor is 2560x1600).  So there     was a workaround - and they might have addressed this too.    But I'm still banned from their forums.[EDIT: It looks like they have indeed added a single player campaign, so I've removed the statement that signle player is missing.]Avoid this one.			"

												Tower Wars is a tower defense game combined with army building. This indie title was released in August 2012, so has been around for a while coming in with about 400k owners on Steam. As with other tower defense games, you start out with a blank battlefield, although this version of tower defense is slightly different to others, you are also fighting against an opponent, who is also building towers on their blank battlefield. The aim of the game is to get your army into the enemies base to destroy their castle before they destroy yours.  Tower Wars has two currency systems, Gold and Battle points - you are able to generate gold via the mines which are already located on your map; you can do the usual technique with tower defense games and upgrade them so that they generate more gold and are quicker at it. Battle points come through sending units to your opponent and working their way to the castle, this of course requires gold though. You build units from your barracks with gold, there is a build queue which you can fill up however you please with different assorted units which you can train, and then push them all out in one go. Your barracks has a cool down so you can only push one wave out every 40 seconds or so. Some units are basic, some have their own special abilities, and some even increase the stats of the whole wave, regardless of whether they are near the units or not. The tower building side of things is again, very similar to other tower defense games, you are able to position your towers pretty much anywhere you want on the map, allowing you to create all sorts of death traps, and corridors that your foe has to battle through, obviously the more ground the opponent has to cover, the more damage you can do to them with your turrets. There are plenty of the normal sort of turrets, such as cannons and arrow launchers, but there are also some really unique ones, such as a huge fan that pushes your opponents back in a certain direction, this makes for some great end of hallway traps!  All of the turrets are able to be upgraded in the usual fashion too, however I didn't really find the need to do that in the single player mode.Tower Wars has a really nice looking graphic and art style; they are really polished and it looks like a lot of care and attention has gone into making this a beautiful steam-punk looking game.  The difficulty in Tower Wars takes a huge ramp up once you get past the tutorial. I will say though, the game's tutorial is really helpful and gets you to grips with the UI and all of the basic elements of the game. It does leave out a few bits that mean you have to go digging around and use a bit of trial and error to see what is what, but that's part of the fun of this type of game.  There are also an abundance of guides, and wiki posts out there if you really want to get into the nitty gritty of it. Since the game is almost four years old now, the multiplayer scene seems to have died down a bit, at the time of writing this there are only  ~30 people playing the game, but thankfully the game does have the option for co-op, so that may peek the attention of some peopleTechnically, this game has a lot of graphical options, allowing you to cater it for your rigs power and capability, coming with plenty of resolution options too. I have put about six hours into Tower Wars so far, and given that matches against the UI/Bots can sometimes last anywhere between 45 minutes and an hour, you can expect to get a lot of gameplay out of this even on the single player mode. If you manage to find yourself a group of friends to play this with, you are looking at a major time sink with ample amounts of fun and content.  I will definitely be carrying on playing Tower Wars after writing this review, since it also has that addicted sort of gameplay that I just cannot put down. Thankfully, due to the price of Tower Wars being £5,59, I am going to strongly recommend this title, if it was any more I would have just said to pick it up when on sale due to the lack of multiplayer activity, but because it is already a low price as it stands, I can easily say you will get at least five or six hours of enjoyment out of it. Hardcore tower defense fans should not miss out on this game!1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												The devs seem to find it perfectly acceptable that players run second accounts that they keep at low levels by giving their points to other players. These low ranked accounts then end up getting matched against players that are playing at their true ranking. Since the scoring is handicapped, this leads to the honest players not gaining anything much when they win, but they will end up losing more times than enough and will have large amounts of points taken away.On paper, they will be losing to a noob and so get penalised, but in reality they are losing to players with skills that place him in the top 10.So, even at the bottomm rungs of the ladder, expect to find excellent players who will take great delight in making sure you end up frustrated and hating this game.Since the game is predominently multiplayer (the bots are fun for a while), what you are paying for is to be meat in the grinder. Avoid.			"

												To me, Tower Wars is like a needy girlfriend. Tower Wars expects far too much from me. Defend a castle whilst producing an assault against the enemies castle? Tower Wars doesn’t know me. Tower Wars doesn't understand that I have to make a solid effort to remember the garlic bread I put in the oven whilst cooking a bolognese. Tower Wars also doesn't realise I often forget to buy spaghetti. Tower Wars, dinner is cancelled. Tower Wars, I can hardly manage tower defence or tower attack on their own, let alone both. Tower Wars, stop mocking my ability to multitask please. D:Tower Wars can be played online, though an interesting concept for a tower defence game, I dared not try it. I lost to the base level AI, that was humiliating enough. I didn't feel like demonstrating how many♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I can suck at this game to online players. :CGreat game for it's price, but it's not for me!			"

												Really fun, challenging game with a (mostly) friendly player base.The single player I found to be a real time sink as I see it as a challenge against yourself. The bots ARE beatable but very hard (especially the final two which are cheating A.I (It's stated in their descriptions)).I found myself constantly trying a new design scheme for a maze seeing what worked best.However the downside to the game (more in multiplayer than Single Player), there's too much emphesis on the earliest moves in the game. If you make just one small mistake against your opponent, it's can be really hard to come back even if they make mistakes further down the line. You're punished more the earlier in the game you make the mistake.Great game well worth the money especially when on sale (which has been happening a lot, I ended up buying it between sales :( )			"

												While the game mechanics are fun it gets boring soon.There are 6 types of maps to play (with some changing gold placings) and when you defeat your first enemy you go to the next level. Which is immediately a harder difficulty. You unlock all your characters and towers in one game.So the next level is only harder, barely anything new, just harder to defeat.I very much prefer to play more of a campaign/story line where you don't experience everything at once so there is something interesting to look forward to when you progress in the game.

												This is a steampunk themed competitive tower defence PvP game, which is quite an intriguing genre.You build towers on a map composed from hexagon tiles, to defend from enemy armies. Nothing special here, typical set of towers available.You send your own armies to attack enemy in order to get battle points which allow you to unlock new units and upgrade old ones. There's more freedom here, and if you know what you're doing, this is a great place to showcase your tactical skills, especially at late stages of the game when some interesting units are available.There's also a little resources gathering aspect to the game.Biggest trick is to efficiently balance your defence, offence, upgrades and resources. If you screw up anywhere, you're done.There's one huge problem with this game, which is why this is a negative review. It has pretty much no tutorial available, no single-player campaign to gradually develop your skills, UI is un-intuitive, controls are messed up, etc. All you have are bots, weakest of which will probably defeat you up to five times untill you grasp basics of the game, and after that you only have try-and-fail approach to figure out why some more sophisticated things work and some don't.And then, playing multiplayer, game becomes over-competetive pretty fast, so unless it's inline whith your character, you will not be able to really casually enjoy the game ...It's a pity, if devs would've spent a little more time to implement decent in-game tutorial and usable UI and controlls, game would be much more playable.

												When i was younger, I saw a little flash game where you were able to defend at the same time that attacking. I really found that funny and great.Later, when I wanted to play it again, I wasn't able to remember the name or the website.And 2-3 years after, I saw Tower Wars. I bought it for me and some of my friends, and it became my favorite game. (I actually do like 2 or 3 hours every morning).Tower Wars is a really beautifully designed Tower Defence with Steampunk like models, where you can place towers to defend your castle at the same time that sending units to try to destroy ennemy's castle. Towers are balanced, Units are quite too, maps details are awesome, musics are just PERFECT. Usually a Game can be between 25 and 60 minutes, 25-60 minutes of fun. And the fact that mines are placed randomly doesn't make you able to have a ""perfect strategy"", that's why you always have a chance to beat other players.I watched some other reviews, most of them are negatives. I will not injure them, but only one thing : Don't trust them. The game is really cheap, so you can simply test yourself. I don't see any problems with the SinglePlayer Bots, I just beat all of them exept the 2 last ones that are 'cheating', with only 2 loses (#4 one and #7 one). Also this game is really fun on Multiplayer, even more at 2v2 and 3v3 Matches, most of the other players I fighted were kind and sympatic.And seriously, THE ONLY THING for me Tower Wars didn't do well is Achievements (Some of them beeing near-impossible to do (and 1 Impossible) and lots of them where you have to do on Ranked Matches), otherwise EVERYTHING ELSE IS PERFECT. Some updates are added between seasons, to balance even more the game. Developpers are kind, Game is perfect.Now my only question is how can a such awesome game have that much negative reviews.			"

												6/10It's a unique kind of mix-up to the Tower Defense genre, where you have to defend using towers like always... AND send out units to act as enemies FOR the opposing team, who has to defend themselves by building their OWN towers. If it would have been a perfect game, it would have gotten a 10 for a really cool mix-up of the genre. But sadly, it's far from perfect. This game has a VERY steep learning curve, and when it was first released it had virtually no singleplayer until they updated it, but guess what? The first bot for singleplayer is hard if you don't know what the hell to do, and the description for it says otherwise! Also, there isn't that much variation and only 10 bots to fight against, meaning this game is predominantly multiplayer, which I honeslty don't like for the TD genre. I'd say to skip this one and get Defense Grid: The Awakening instead if at full price, but it's on sale for 2 bucks frequently, and for that price, I'd say it's worth it.			"

Posted: September 3, 2014
												Tower Wars is an interesting idea bogged down by its excessive attempts to condense and entire tower defense experience into a single match.The basic concept of Tower Wars is a competitive TD game where you control both the towers and the enemies, and have to balance throwing tons of grunts at the enemy castle while building up your own defenses to keep theirs away. Adding onto this is a huge upgrade tree, from unlocking new grunt types, to passive upgrades for all units, to upgrading your towers and already unlocked grunts. Essentially everything can be upgraded several times over, and with a limited amount of resources you need to pay careful attention to what you invest in or else be overrun by the other player.If this sounds like a lot to take in, that's because it is. Tower Wars is absurdly involved, as it takes the features that would normally be slowly added over the course of a typical TD game and instead gives you them all for the one self contained match you are already in. As a result it's incredibly overwhelming, and causes matches to stretch on for far longer than they have any right to. The tutorial match alone took nearly an hour, and my first match against the easiest AI opponent in the game about 30 minutes more (which ultimately ended in my defeat). If you're going up against a real human opponent of equal skill, expect this time per match to only rise further, which creates a huge commitment on the player that could ultimately prove for naught.Ultimately Tower Wars asks too much of the player without giving them a reason to stick with it through the long periods of tedium that inevitably occur after the first 10-15 minutes when you've placed most of your towers and begin the long game of tug of war, as you incrementally chip away at each other's castles until someone gets a lucky break and finally pushes through. The concept is a really neat one, but the way it's executed here is dull and overly complex to the point I was begging for defeat simply so the match would be over. I love TD games, probably more than I should, but nothing about Tower Wars ever manifested itself into anything fun or engrossing and just left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and had nothing to show for it.

												Tower Wars is the tower defense genre taken to its logical conclusion, a game where you both defend with towers and attack other peoples' towers. To that end it's mainly a multiplayer game, though the last major update added ten levels of bots to lose to without anyone knowing your shame. It's a good thing too, because the odds of you getting a match against a person aren't very good these days.Each match gives you command over a castle, a barracks, and large tracts of hex-gridded land, all mirrored by your opponent. Your task is to send waves of attackers to destroy your foe's castle while maintaining a field of towers to defend your own castle. The resource that fuels both of these labors is gold, mined from upgradable plots in your territory, so right away you have a balance that must be struck between offense and defense. In addition, your attackers earn Battle Points for the time they spend (alive) in enemy territory. These points are used to unlock new units, upgrade your units, and upgrade your mines.If all this is starting to sound complicated, well, it is. You need to be sending troops to attack, upgrading those troops, upgrading your mines, and managing your own towers, all based out of two resource pools. And yes, just the tower defense part is full-fledged tower defense, with the ability to place upwards of a hundred towers on a single map, of eight different types and three upgrade levels. Layering further complexity over that, while an interesting idea, makes the game a huge struggle to keep up with. It's basically Build Orders: The Game, so if that was your favorite part of Starcraft, there might be something here for you to latch onto.Even so, it's hard to give a positive review to a multiplayer-focused game with no player base. None of my half-dozen attempts to find a match, ranked or unranked over several days, met with success. Poking around the forums it seems there are only a few dozen active players left, and there may be something wrong with matchmaking that the developers have not addressed. It's just as well, because the complexity pushes it up into DOTA territory, long matches and all. A single round can last thirty minutes to an hour, and a loss after all that time really hurts because it earns you nothing. There are no unlocks or points or anything to chase, just match after match. And when you can't even find one, that's a problem.			"

												Straighten up and get in line!  Tower Wars is a unique tower defense game with a heavy emphasis on technique and planning.  This isn't your grannies Bloon Wars, babies!  If you're too good at the rest, come play with the best.  A super-helpful and friendly community, addicting gameplay, ranked seasons where players who truly put in the effort can win fame and prizes and a delightfully whimsical Steampunk art style.  The learning curve is high, but those who perservere and learn the ropes march towards glory.  Be warned:  You WILL get your backsides handed to you your first few rounds in multiplayer, but not to fret.  The community has done a great job of creating guides and videos that are easily available to get new players up to speed, and the guy who just slaughtered you in six rounds will also more than likely be totally willing to give you a practice round or two to show you how things work.  All that said, my favorite part of this game is actually the audio and voice acting.  Skillfully put together, it matches the art in theme and energy, and the voices of both the King and the troops are amusing even when you're on a losing streak.			"

												This is one of the best Tower Defense games I've ever played! I've played PixelJunk Monsters, and I was also a huge fan of the Warcraft III Tower Defense mini-games on Battle.net. While Tower Wars isn't exactly like either of those, although similar, to me it seems like one of the most challenging.The game allows you to ""maze"", where you create your towers in a maze pattern, to lengthen the path of travel the minions must take, and at the same time challenges you to either create a maze, or cluster your towers together.It's a pretty simple game, but among all of the tower defense games I've played, I really like the way the maps challenge your strategizing skills.It's really a great game. If you love any kind of tower defense games, you'll love this.			"

												Disappointing multiplayer focused tower defence.Tower Wars' twist is that in addition to the traditional tower defence you also need to balance your time gathering resources to build an army to attack your opponent and destroy their castle.  The tutorial shows you the basics, but then your only option is to play online.  There is no single player mode to play against the AI to find out the strengths and weaknesses of towers, units or the tech tree.Multiplayer only contains 4 maps, and given the indie nature of the game there aren't a lot of active players so you could be waiting a while for a match.

												I was looking for a tower defense game wherein I could sit and play the game for more than an hour and not get bored. I found Tower Wars on sale and immediately grabbed as I'm a fan of worlds created with hexagonal terrains put together.The game resembles Tropical Tower Wars, a custom WarCraft III map that I used to play. Instead of having a fixed pathways and a place for your towers, you create the maze yourself. The world is made out of hexagon tiles separated into different islands. Three gold mines for each team are randomly placed in the map to create diversity for your mazing strategies.Controls[+] Not much to say on this as the game uses the most conventional controls for any Tower Defense game. In the time that I played I haven't felt any type of discomfort even once.Graphics[+] As I said before, I am a fan of game terrain made out of hexagon tiles. [+] The maps for different modes was well made allowing different kinds of strategies to be put to use.Balance[+] The bots are good for people who are learning the game. They start from easy and eventually gets more challenging as you defeat more of them one by one.[+] The game gives you freedom on how you want to handle your mazes.[+] It also has a route detector to make the game eye-friendly despite building a big amount of towers and stops you from messing up in case you get confused in your own maze.[-] Although it gets challenging as you pick higher level of bots. The only difference you see is the rate of how fast they upgrade their towers, and mines. They keep recycling the same strategy over and over.Others[+] Variety of maps to choose from.[+] You can either play defensive, offensive, or balance depending on how you wish to control the game.[-] Few people are playing and on that ""few people"" even fewer people plays Human vs. Human. Thus, expect long queues when you want to play multiplayer.			"

There are only 10 in campaing but you will have to keep trying and you'll hardly get it in the first go.There is a online ""Season"" mode where you fight other humans for score you can see your score on the leadboards.A co-op mode which is very really hard, I was playing with a mate in co-op mode and we lasted about an hour both times but suddenly the map changes due to events and you have to re-act fast or the ""Pirates"" will get to your castle!And of course and ""Classic Tower Defence"" mode which is just sitting back and letting the towers do the work.The settings are also very edit-ableThere are hardly any downs to this game the only thing i can conplain about is that for some reason the loading screen is a bit laggy sometimes but thats a minor flaw.Over all this game is great and easy to pick up.

So you need to balance your attack and defense.  If you can't find the right ""balance"", you'll fail.You can, like always, upgrade towers + the enemies you send and some general behaviors (like walking speed for all units).This game is a lot of fun for 2 players playing in VS, lot of fun in multiplayer (where you can learn new tricks at the cost of a defeat) and now you can even play VS bots, on your favorite map (still can't beat BOT level 5!!)For 2$, you can't go wrong with this game.

You need a few hours to master all the mechanics, but then it's great entertainment.You and your opponent both have castles and barracks, and you need to send waves to destroy each other, while simultaneously upgrading your units and castles as well as tending to your gold mines. Gold is mainly needed for recruiting units, and as long as they are within enemy territory, they earn ""battle points"" for you, which you need for upgrades. This makes for some challenging gameplay, as you need gold to earn battle points, but also battle points to get upgrades to earn more gold, ...There are many different units, each with unique attributes - speed, health, damage dealt (against opponent's castle), armor, shield. Some have special abilities, e.g. they increase other units' speed or improve their shields.Similarly, there are lots of different towers with unique strengths and weaknesses, e.g. arrow towers, cannons, lava distributors, fans (to slow down the enemy's units) etc.There are a few maps shipped with the game and you can download additional maps from the community. The gold mines are always placed randomly, which means that for every match, you need to come up with a new path around which to build your defense towers (although you will always be using the same basic structures).I recommend that you buy this on sale and get additional keys for your friends, because as mentioned above, it's hard to even find opponents for multiplayer, and the matching can take ages. But I have spent way too many hours playing against buddies now and we're all hooked!PROS:[+] Challenging game mechanics[+] Awesome multiplayer mode (1v1, 2v2, 3v3)[+] Many maps to choose from and random adjustments in each round[+] Very cool steampunk settingCONS:[-] Steep learning curve (although this becomes rewarding if you don't give up early)[-] Very few people ""out there"" for multiplayer matches (but it's more fun with friends anyway)[-] Boring co-op mode			"

												Tower wars is what one would expect from a defense/offense game. On one side of the defense you have a VARIETY of awesome towers that you can build and upgrade each with their own specific purpose (arrows, cannons, launchers, giant hammers, giant fans to slow enemies etc...). The castle is also upgradable by means of shield or ammunition effectiveness (that's as far as castle upgrades go). There are also unlock-able units as you play depending on what you want to unlock and they can also be upgraded. To go beyond upgrading simple units, the game has a upgrade system where you can add shields, armor, or even health to the units. The upgrade system (building) allows for other upgrades such as reduced wait time to send a wave of attacking units to your enemy, bigger barracks, spawn random units when deploying an assault, or upgrade battle points so you receive more. This game is also multiplayer which makes it all that much better!I would highly recommend this game. The visuals were done right, the sounds were done right, the units were done right, the delivery on the game play was done right. Variations and modifications are always welcomed and a simple layout style (with some random obstacles) always make for an interesting game. Warning though, one game can take 45 min to an 1 h. So don't expect to jump in and jump out. If you want a game that's not 45 minutes long I HIGHLY suggest CastleStorm which is sort of similar to this but a 2D (3D graphics) platformer.RATING : 8/10.Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BSmall update as of May 13th, 2015... a few of my friends have reported lag when there are a lot of units on the screen when playing multiplayer. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this.			"

												Tower Wars...This game is a true challenge. After over 80 hours of game play and frustration I learned that the secret to beating this game is competitive thinking, and a ballance of everything you have to do. You cannot focus on gold but not upgrade units. You cannot focus on units and not on upgrade shields and other abilities. on top of all, your route that you creat for your enemy has to be complet and have many twists and turns. the more the enemy has to move atound corners and twist and turn, the slower they are. lava towers are almost useless, don't waste time with them. your best towers are the bows, cannons and fans to slow down the enemy. As well as the shock towers? a good strategy of taking down shields, while being able to attack in a split second makes all the difference.If you like a challenge and thinking on your feet. i highly reccommend this tower defence game.

Tower wars can support up to 6 players at once on multiplayer (3v3) and ive gotton my friends together to play the game and has been a lot of fun ^.^With the steam workshop being a feature, you can play on user created maps which make the game 10x more infinatly fun.i really do suggest you buy this if you havent already as it can be really fun. :DSuch fun, much wow.

												Fun game. I'm surprised the game is/was still being updated. For exmaple they made the early bots a lot easier than they used to be. The game is well crafted and balanced, and has potential to be very competative. However there is very little content (a mediocre number of towers and units) and very few maps. I have not done any multiplayer yet, but the game seems to have a very steep learning curve, so I doubt I will fare well.Overal I recommend the game, but be prepared to bang your head against the wall while trying to learn its mechanics. I recommend reading the game's wiki after losing a match or two.			"

												Tower Wars is the most active, exciting, addictive, and well-made TD you'll find around.I've been in many TDs in my life, but this, THIS, is amazing. Adding an amazing Multiplayer mode that puts you head to head to other player is just amazing, you just CAN'T miss it.In Tower Wars you'll find: - Great and fun graphics: The game looks very colorful, camera rotation and distance lets you see almost everything, each upgrade does look different and it's very rewarding.- Great music and effects (Yeah, there isn't much music, but I find it fits perfectly).- Excellent maps for mazing, and random positioned goldmines that will obstacle your rutinary mazes, so you'll have to always think of how will you maze in each match.- Simply exciting, the multiple strategies are just comparable with SC2 matches. You'll always have to see what's your enemy doing to make the right decisions.You. Can't. Miss. It.			"

												This game is absolutely awesome. I bought it on a chance on steam sale, and honestly in hind sight I'd have easily payed more than the full asking price for this game. I've sunk 25 hours into it and I'm no where near done with it. The graphics are basic, but HIGHLY polished and good looking. This game will most certainly age well for the style they've chosen. It's a tower defence with RTS elements so you are both attacker and defender, the game has a steam punk theme, good music well directed art, and has very few bugs which is impressive generally, but particularly for a smaller development scheme. The single player is challenging even at the lower levels, so if you want to fight bots they have everything from ""I'm barely paying attention"" to ""How is it even possible to generate units that quickly?!?"" and unlike bots in most games, these will actually ready you for playing against other players.. Which is good because you can rock 3 vs 3's in this title and oh my god will you.Balanced enough that you can't even gripe when you lost because you messed up or the other player managed their resources better than you did.Do I recommend this game? ABSOLUTELY. Normally I would say why aren't you buying it right now, but that doesn't do it justice. Buy the three pack, give copies to two people you play with regularly and remember to invite me.

												Tower Wars gets a big thumbs up from me! This game is hard though and it can get annoying if you keep failing. This game isn't your typical Tower Defense game, you must defend your castle from enemies but you must also send troops to destroy the enemies castle. You can play regular Tower Defense if you want to but there is no point of buying this game if you're interested in your regular Tower Defense. Anyways, there is even multiplayer where you must destroy another players castle. The graphics are also the best I have ever seen in a Tower Defense game. If you like Tower defense games in general than this is definitely worth being in your collection.			"

Tower Wars is a great strategy game. Developed by a great team who continue to put in the hours developing and fixing this game and what's more updates are frequent. The gameplay its self is amercing and keeps the player focused. The game's greatest strength though is also its greatest weakness, with a complicated meta and extensive set of mechanics the learning curve is harsh but rewarding. If you are prepared to spend the time you will have a great time while if you are only a casual player you are going to have a bad time. How ever I did put in the time and had a spectacular experience so I really have to recommend it.Pricing: Fantastic, Especially on Sale.Gameplay: ComplexControls: AdequateOptions: GoodRe-play Value: SuperbMulriplayer: Niche/Quite8/10 "

The gameplay against bots is all about sending as much troops as you can to get as much battlepoints as you can to get as much upgrades as you can before your enemy does so its quit fast for a strategy game. But if you play a nice, slow round with a friend its totaly fun. Well if you like fast strategy its also fun :P			"

												In a World where Tower Defense games flood the Market, where one is like any other with just miniscule changes there is sometimes someone trying to switch things up a little.technically, the principle of Tower Wars has been used in tons of WarCraft 3 Maps before. but still, this is a TD game that still manages to stand out.Because your enemy is not a set of 20 pre-made waves.It is a Human.Yes, Tower Wars, as Avertised is a PvP tower Defense Game. And while it follows the ""Mazing"" style of TDs (you have no predetermined path enemies take. you have a patch of land and the enemies will take the shortest route towards your Fortress) it also forces you to focus on how you will attack. You gain resources by killing enemies and having your people waddle as far as they can.Now the Towers and Enemies are where the fun starts. You are not presented with the standart ""Normal tower/ Faster but weaker tower/Splash Tower/Slow Tower"" variety, but rather towers that focus on different kinds of Health as well as some supporting towers, like a wind turbine that slows enemies in its path or a huge pot that throws boiling oil to all its sides.As far as the offensive units go, you go from the why do I worry-kind of standart waddler, faster waddlers, healing waddlers, shielding waddlers, carrying waddlers, as well as Upgrades for them. in the end I believe you stand with as many supporting units as you have actual damaging units.Rounds may be short (if any of the players really messes up his BO) or can draw out to a 2 hour ""We all send a full wave of our biggest units, all fully upgraded through each others maze and look what happens""-Stalemate. but even those are fun, because its like a snail race. In the end you only win or lose by a hairs width.Also, Bots in 10 difficulty flavors have been implemented. So if you cant find a match (or just wanna get back in form) you can always challenge one of those to get your TD Madness on			"

												I recently got the game(2$ on discount) and played around 15times. I like it! It is a pretty good Maze building TD and it definetely worthed the 2$.There are practically two types of games: Tower Defense and Tower Wars ( for those familiar with old Warcraft3 maps)If you like competitive tower defense games, I'd say give it a shot!Some game features:Tower Defense type is played vs AI; Tower Wars types can be played both vs other players or vs AI.It can be played in max 3v3 players, or 3 Co-op vs AI.There are around 5-6 maps that you can play on, and every new round the layout is a little changed so you have to adapt your maze from game to game.The game is based on two resources: gold and battle points. Gold is earned every few seconds based on your income(which increases by buying/upgrading miners). Gold is used for building/upgrading towers and also for sending units.Battle points are earned by the units you send out. Battle points are spent for unit upgrades, unlocking new units, buying minersThere aren't as many types of towers or creep units types as I'd wish but it ok:- around 8 types of towers ( each can be upgraded 3 times - but it's a liniar upgrade, no branches or other abilities/customization of towers)- around 10 units(again each with some upgrades)- castle upgrades for armor or damage- a pretty complex tree structure for speed/armor/shield/health and other stuff as general upgrades for all unitsAt first it was a little strange the way you choose/upgrade towers(hold and drag mouse) but I got used with it and then I found out you can also use key shortcuts(shift+click,ctrl+click) "

												I felt in love with Tower Wars concept since the very first WMW (Wintermaul Wars), which was just a simple UMS (custom map) for Warcraft 3 game. And this was around ten years ago, around 2004-2005. Long time ago...Tower Wars is a strategy game. It combines classical TD (tower defense) elements with a war elements, where YOU are the one who sends the troops, not the AI. It's like taking old WMW concept and creating a game based on that. And, I must agree that it ended pretty well.It's not an easy game, tower wars requires from you a tactical thinking and the willing to practice... much. By playing this title, you'll need to balance between the offense and the defense, You'll need to decide whether to upgrade existing towers, or create new ones, between upgrading existing troops and training new ones.What I can say about this title... It's good. Graphics are nice, it's well balanced game, I didn't find any bigger issues, and I can really recommend this game. If you've ever played a tower defense game, and you liked the concept, you'll like this one even more. If you did not, I'd still give it a try, because game is awesome and building a strong defense is as important as attacking the enemy with strong troops.9.5/10			"

Today, it's like 90% of tower defense games that are single player vs creeps alone, and of those, mazing is only present like half the time. This game, on the other hand, is everything that made those couple of modded maps into their own entire genre of game: co-op play, attack AND defense, tons of upgrades, mazing, etc.Also has great graphics and music, and the story mode writing is witty.

												Tower Wars,It's not your average tower defence game. Sure it has a survival mode to play it that way but that's not the sole action of this game. It's a tower defender and attacker! That's right you have to go on the offence or no matter how great you planning if you only defend you will fail. In fact if your balance of attach vs defence is even a little off you will fail. The computer baddys are tough, and may even break you heh. The real grabber with this game though is the online portion. You can battle with or against friends and strangers from across the world. Yes I used the plural, you can join with up to two other people per team (3 total) for a 6 player game! This is a fantasticly fun way to play. Mixing more than one mind into the game makes it a lot of fun, and a bit more challenging. Things happen fast, so don't plan on a extended set up period. A game can be completed in just a few turns or it can last for up to an hour (In one battle I had so far) all depending on the skill level and a little bit of luck in mine placements which are always random. The good:Instant funDecent ""Cartoony"" graphicssmooth, lag free playPlay with friends! New exciting twist to the tower defence genreThe bad:Can be a little slow to loadYou don't get the option to ""Rematch"" and the game quits out on it's own after a match. So no chance to ask the other player to a hosted battle for a rematch either.The above makes meeting new people that play and growing your circle in the game a bit harder than it should be.You can always use the steam ""Recently Played"" list but you shouldn't have to.

												when you first start the game tips can be helpfull.These Tower Wars tips can be really usefull when you are learning the game.of course,if the game is called TOWER wars you must place towers.At the start of the game when enemy mr.moopsys are coming you should get arrow towers. Once your opponent is sending units with armour, (the yellow bar on top of the health bar) or is sending knights or zoombots you should get cannons. Once the units are coming with shields (the ring that goes around there body) you HAVE to place electricity towers.And yes, sending units.You NEED to send units to earn BP.With BP you can get miners, more units, upgrade units and upgrade your castle. And try upgrading units. Don't think you can't upgrade your units because of the lock. And buy miners and upgrade your mines.If you get it have fun :)			"

												Most tower defense games put you in charge of building towers to defeat waves of enemies sent to your base by the computer. Tower Wars however takes this idea and makes it a two player competitive game. Not only do you build towers, but you yourself also send waves of units to attack the other player's base while he sends waves of units to attack yours. All the staples of tower defense in competitive mode. It's so brilliant a concept I find it hard to believe it's not used more. Of course you can also play classic tower defense alone in an included mode if you want, but that defeats what makes this game unique.			"

												Tower Wars pits you against an AI as you are trying to conquer each other's HQ, on a hex battlefield, where you have to build defense towers to stop the enemy units, while improve the mines to get more resources to fund your factories, upgrade your units, and eventually produce enough units to conquer the enemy HQ. The game uses a whimsical / comical / steampunk look for its units, which hides a serious RTS underneath. There is a serious tower defense game (where you have to build towers to ""manage"" the enemy horde by making them walk through your field of fire. And yes, you can improve the towers too. It's a regular tower defense game. There is resource management in that you have to control the mines to ensure you have proper flow of resources to fuel your tower building as well as unit making and unit improvement research. You mainly do this by making sure the mines are controlled by towers, and improved to ensure they have good throughput. Then you need to research units, each of which have a different use against certain types of enemy towers. Some are fast but low armor, some are juggernauts that move slowly, some heal, some shield, etc. And add them, in the right order, to yoru build queue, and hopefully, push the enemy back enough to take out his HQ. There are many different maps and different AI to keep you busy. If you can take the art style, this game can be interesting.			"

												FlynnLivesSep 1, 201210FINALLY! Someone made an actual Tower Wars game! The mods were so much fun, so it's awesome that SuperVillain made an actual game to pretty much officially kick off the genre (I think?)! Basically, not only do you set up your towers and maze to defend, but you send out your own armies to attack the other castle! Lots of units to unlock and upgrade by using an RTS system (tech tree). And the humor is a nice touch too. Who doesn't love a robot named Stanley Clunkerbottom? The meat of the experience is the multi-player for sure! It supports local hosted and ranked matches, so you can play with friends until you're ready to head out into a ranked match. 2v2 is probably my favorite, and the game goes all the way up to 3v3 (and 1v1 of course). And there IS a single player ""Classic"" mode, which is like other normal Tower Defense games where you just defend as long as you can. But this thing REALLY shines in multi-player modes that it's built for!And, for what it's worth, the game is gorgeous if you have a gaming PC with some muscle. But it also lets you customize all settings for weaker machines too, and even looks pretty good at lower settings. Looks like a miniatures set up! I want to play this in real life!Highly recommended for fans of Tower Defense, RTSs, Table-Top Games, or multi-player with friends! Oh, and for $10? No brainer!			"

												OK, so it's a tower defence game, if you didn't figure that out by the name then perhaps this isn't the game for you. Before the option to play bots came in this was a painful game to play as I kept getting creamed online, as I didn't really have a firm strategy, and I suspect that there is no MMR a la Dota so the likelehood is if you play online you will get matched with someone on a different level to yourself, be it lower or higher. Since the option to play bots came in though I have thoroughly enjoyed it. Not the best in the genre, but pretty good all the same.			"

												If you're a fan of the tower defense genre, Tower Wars is a surprisingly good offering. I must warn that it is primarily head-to-head tower defense, so none of the storyline or RPG tie-ins that other titles offer. Still, it's very well-made and is a great example of the genre. You build towers to channel and kill enemies, while balancing resource production, units to pressure your enemy, your defenses, and upgrading your units to do more damage. It's a pretty interesting priority based system where every game plays out very differently based on how you and your opponent react. The way it makes me think is more like a RTS than a tower defense game. Pretty good.			"

												Tower wars is a steampunk, competitive, Tower Defense game that challenges the preconceptions of the genre by putting you in control of not only your towers, but the lemmings that throw themselves at the defenses of your opponent.It requires maintaining a delicate balance between building your towers and upgrading (and purchasing) your troops.  Focus too much on your towers, and your enemy will overwhelm you with a superior economy; but focus too much on creating an army and your defenses will fall to even the puniest wave.The ecnomy of the game requires two currencies:  Gold (used to purchase troops, unlock new troops, and build and upgrade towers) which is mined through randomly placed mines that must be upgraded, and Battle Points (used to upgrade toops and mines) which is gained through sending troops into battle.  The interdependency of these two currencies further requires maintaining a delicate balance between offense and defense.Battles can be decisive and quick if the skills are mismatched; but if you find a good opponent, then you'll find yourself in for a campaign of attrition which could take upwards of two hours.  It's a high stakes tower defense game that offers a high amount of replayability; but the lack of map content (three total) leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to diversity of content.			"

												I want to start off by saying that this game is excellent.This is basically the next level of Tower Defensse strategy gaming. The newly added AI opponents are very challenging, which was a pleasent surprise to me. The online community is actually very nice, and for the most part is willing to help. The competitive gameplay is just overall a great thing. The graphics are simply great! It gives you a nice steam punk feel.If I had to really be picky about a con of this game, it would be that the learning curve is steep. Don't let them steer you away, though. The community has provided a bunch of guides and most players are willing to help!If you have ever played Bloons TD, or any other TD, get this game. Yes it is harder, but it is totally worth it.			"

												An interesting take on the classic tower defence genre, Tower wars  is a fantastic game where, not only do you build towers to defend your castle, but you also need to send waves of enimies through your opponent's own maze to take down their castle.  The controls are easy to grasp, with plently of shortcuts for common  tower placements to place clutch buildings down in the nic of time. Hand in hand with the idea of  commanding an army and a maze, you are needed to manage a plethora of upgrades for your towers, units, and even your castle. These upgrades demand players to strike a balance between offence and defence, and makes  ""turtling up"" or ""going all out"" not the best stategies, expecially in longer games.If you are a fan of classic tower defense games, I would suggest this game to you in a heartbeat.

												This is one of those very rare few tower defence games that truly capture the intense feel of strategy, and wraps it all up brilliantly in eye-pleasing graphics, top notch strategy choices and detailed yet simplistic gameplay!The learning curve may be a steep one, but after that initial first few rounds the gameplay will flow through and the great war between man and machine can truly begin! Whether with a friend co-op or even against the insanely challenging bots, a ball is to be had with this game.So if you love endless waves of enemies, with multiple towers and upgrades to choose from, and the awesome added support of playing with a buddy, then this game is for you! Ragequitters and loners beware!			"

												Not a bad game, this one. I believe steam needs more steampunk games and this certainly fits the bill. Not one of those corny Japanese Steampunk games either, more a violent, wild west, tower defense steampunk game. Build your base, send out your cannoneers, don your top hat and smoke your pipe. Worth picking up if you like this kind of thing.			"

												Heads-up:  This is not a single-player game.  Not really.  There's three maps that have 'endless' modes, and the tutorial has some scripted AI to simulate a real match, but this is basically a competitive 'versus mode' online multiplayer game only.  Single-player might get patched in or made into DLC at some point, so let me know if you want me to keep an eye out for that, for you.			"

												I love this game but the balance against bots(which is how most people learn to play a new game) is way off. At round two the bots will start to send upgraded and new units at you continually. In that same amount of time I am able to put up 3-4 towers and send out a wave of 5-6 units. Difficulty seems very broken and punishing to me.That being said. I really like this game. Love the concept, the graphics, voice acting, music(amazing music actually). The brutal bot difficulty(why not have an adjustable difficulty for single player?) is keeping me from being completely in love with it.I do absolutely recommend this game though. It is very well done and multiplayer matches are an absolute blast(especially with a group of friends on skype or local lan.) My only complaint is the one that I mentioned involving the single player experience.*FWIW. In the menu when you click tutorial, it will bring up the single player menu again. You have to click Tutorial again to actually play it. A very minor issue but an odd one considering the ""Tutorial"" button is on the main screen but it does not actually take you to the tutuorial.*Update* I must say that I am impressed with how much the maker of this game has been in the  forum responding to comments and giving feedback to the players. It is refreshing to see someone who cares about their audience and the experience the audience is having with their product. He has addressed all my concerns in my original review and new content updates to implement further training levels are forthcoming.*End of update*			"

												Can't recommend this game to TD fans. Because it is not a classic TD (except few levels for best time matches). It is an online ranked matches game where you attack and defence at the same time. Interesting idea, but not a TD. Also, no matter how many towers you build or upgrade, you can't stop a single wave and this is a disappointing experience for a TD game..			"

												Fun game, solid gameplay although it has little diversity. The few tower types make the game slightly disappointing, but the upgrades make it worth it. The main problem I have with it is the co-op gameplay.The co-op gameplay consists of only one map. This would be barely ok if it weren't for the fact that the difficulty on this map is just damn near impossible. Eventually the boss just kills your entire maze bringing it down to 1/4 of your once used build space. And the zone that gets overtaken is now a spawning point. To top things off, this boss is nuking and instagibing sections of your maze. This would all be fine, if it didn't become so frustratingly impossible at the end of the 3rd wave. Honestly I think it needs to be redone to a possible difficulty, and keep the current one and call it ""Impossible Mode.""TL;DR this is a good game to play solo. Not suitable for co-op unless you and your buddy wanna pay $10 for one map that's nigh impossible to beat. 6/10 would play again... but barely.			"

												Tower Wars twists the tower defense genre by taking into the world of online competitive multiplayer gaming. Each player is tasked with using a variety of unique structures to force enemy units into mazes of death while at the same time creating their own army to assault the enemy’s home fortress. The game is a nice, fresh twist on an established formula but Tower Wars’ most glaring fault is the absence of a single player mode. Without it, new players are forced into a online matches against experienced players which is more than enough to discourage repeat play.Tower Wars feels as if it were designed specifically for hardcore strategists. With a tutorial that skips important concepts and the tendency for matches to become one sided. Still, after you get the hang of it and learn the strategies, this game turns into an enjoyable experience.			"

All the other creep types arn't really any kind of threat.  This is kind of dissapointing.  I got a few hours of entertainment out of it.  I am not sure it was worth the price I paid.  It doesn't really have much a solo game, and if you buy it, it will mainly be multi-player.			"

												Hm, I wish I could say it is a nice game!I really like tower defend games and I have played it many hours. The 2 dimensional Tec tree for Fraction and Units is great, especially you only can unlock it by Invasionpoints.You have only a small variance of towers, each with just 2 upgrades. So you tactic has small limits.The balancing is not good. After the beginning phase you can easily upgrade each tower to max level. But each upgrade increase the tower strength only a little bit. In the end game you can stop the forces only by numbers.But the game is only designed for 1 vs. 1 matches and on the multiplayer server you can easily wait 5 min for a game. "

												Interesting game with robots, a mixture of tower defense and offense.Well does it actually make sense? xD So basiscally in this game you have to defend your castle but attack and destroy the enemy's one at the same time. Interesting fact is that your troops never confront the enemy troops, so you can only kill bad guys with your weapons used for defense. Can be played either with bots or  a human but the multiplayer seems to be abandoned. Still a good game to have some fun. If you dont want to purchase for full price,which I actually dont advise, wait for a sale it's recommended to try and play. Happy Batt... err Wars...ing everyone! Brand new verb, that is! xD :D Alright let's sum up the pros and cons!Pros:+ interesting gameplay and mixture of defending and attacking+ pretty good arsenal, and bunch of cool and interesting robots+ easy to play, not complicated at all but hard to master really fastCons:- The ranked/unranked match section is dead and seems to be really abandoned- Figthing bots can be boring after a time- No opportunity to save during matches against bots, few more maps could've been great			"

												A rare gem for tower wars fans, offering an experience quite different from all the tower defense clones out there. Sadly there aren't too many active players anymore and those that are left are relatively hardcore. Still, if you get a good offer the single player alone is worth the cost.			"

												The music gets stuck in my head to the point where I sing it loudly and sarcastically both during and after the game.The overall experience reminds me of BUX Wars War3 mod map (unsure if the two are somehow related), but with the added benefit of great level design with a small amount of randomization to keep each play fresh.Some strategies come in and out of fashion so you may find yourself under the heel a lot in online play if you don't keep up with whatever is cheesing this month, but for casual play between friends it is EXCELLENT. Highly recommended for a good TD romp.			"

												Tower wars is one of the best tower defence games ive seen. Theres 2 game modes, 1 is classic tower defence and the other is something else...In the second gamemode you have to build towers, as well as send your own troops to battle. You can also upgrade your own troops and unlock new ones by getting battle points.The way you progress is by getting gold from your gold mines, which you can upgrade using gold and battle points you have earned fighting. Everything in this game is upgradeable. From towers to troops to gold mines to your own castle.This game is amazing.If you are a tower defence game fan, you will love this.			"

												Wow.  This is one of those TD games you can't seem to stop playing.  Good graphics, good upgrade system, everything.  My only complaint is that the multi player doesn't have a lot of activity.  It's OK, though, since I'm like 31 hours into it, and can't beat stage 3 of the campaign.  Even not on sale, you're getting your money's worth on this one.			"

												I love Tower Defense games so much, and this game is REALLY FUN if you enjoy TD games. One of the greatest features of this game is you have to actively send out ""creeps"" against your opponent while still maintaining your own tower defense line. You also have to manage your income in the form of mines (you can upgrade them task more miners)The upgrading is very basic, max level 3 for towers; however, there is a good amount of diversity for the macro-upgrading trees. For this, you have to spend both money AND battle points. You get battle points by sending troops out (most likely to die), so playing defensively might not be the best option if your oppnent is beating you in gold and battlepoint revenue.You can use your towers to make mazes for the creep to pass through, and the feedback showing exactly where the creeps will travel is really helpful. Admittedly, I've taken lessons from the AI's layout. The learning curve is pretty good despite the extra mechanics, I think the only thing people need to be aware of is how critical getting battlepoints is - balancing your income is key. There is no point of having 10000+ gold if you're waiting on your battlepoints to upgrade your stuff.Aesthetically, the game is very nice and charming. I'm used to towers getting the most insignificant aesthetic changes in old school TD games, but all of the towers here come with their own newer, badder look. The feedback for enemy health, movement, etc is very seamless - so you can still keep track of how much damage you're doing despite 100 catapults shrouding an enemy (pretty good tactic in all TDs actually - artillery for the win!)For the price, I would definitely recommend getting it, especially if you're a fan of tower defense games!

												This is a fairly enjoyable game, though it admittedly takes a little getting used to at first for this is a tower offense/tower defense mix.  Not only will you have to worry about managing towers and shaping your lanes, but you'll need to upgrade troops, que them up, and send them toward the enemy castle.  The constant upgrading you'll be required to do to stay competitive, in addition to managing everything else, will keep you busy from start to finish.  In fact it may even be too much for some people, though I personally enjoy it.  Worth the $2 I spent during a Steam sale.

												Great Game! Head to Head Tower Defense in its purest form. Steep learning curve, highly competitive. Games can take a long time once you and your opponent both master the game. I only ever play unranked since ranked is so highly competitive that I don't stand a chance. Hosting games for my friends and family in a more casual environment this game is spectacular. I truly enjoy this title. We play it madly for a few days at a time then return to it one or two months later and play it madly again. endless replayability when you have friends or family who also enjoy it. The closest comparison I can make to this title would be Swords and Soldiers which is also one of my favorite games, just far more casual than this one.			"

												I find I have a lot of fun with this game. Tower Wars is a challenging tower-defence game, but with a twist where in one game mode you can send out armies to attack the enemy to gain battle tokens. Even if they don't reach they castle, you get tokens based on how far they go.I find it enjoyable, even when losing which is easy if you don't get a good balance of putting up towers, shaping the path, putting up the right de-buffing towers and so on. It's cartoonish effects make the game a lot of fun t play and there are 10 levels of difficulty to play, though from what I can tell no actual story in the game itself.However a big complaint I have is that it seems to be prone to crashing. I'm uncertain if this is a common factor on other people's systems, but it does seem to be prone to crashing, though when it does crash it just closes rarther than going black screen or forcing steam to crash which tells me it's possibly being worked on in patches. Still, it is quite a enjoyable game and I recommend you give it a go if you are a fan of tower-defence games.			"

												This is a tower defence game.You build a maze and enemys run throu it.There are the normal tower defence and the 1v1 tower defence.The normal is nothing realy specialy but then again it is good to know that I am bad at tower defence.But 1v1 is intressting.1v1:Here you play another player you build your maze but you also send minions in to your opponents maze so you have to carefuly balance your resorces and think about how much is worth sending in cause if you send to weak units your enemy just get easie reasurces.Maps:There is if you ask me abit to few maps so if you pick random you have a big chance of playing the same over and over but on the possetive side is that your mines thjat give you gold are not placed in the same way every time so you have to adapt to each layout.Summery and own thoughts:It is fun to play 1v1 but other then that it is a tower defence and I am bad at them so I am not the best judge of this game but it has fun gameplay varried units and towers.If you are going to pick this up play it with a friend you will have alot more fun.Good luck and defend your castle.

												Bought this game to play MP with my wife, we love playing games together and love tower defense. It was a shame then that when we played a multiplayer co-op game almost everytime we are deep into the waves the servers either cut out and kick us or the games just freeze. we have tried for hours on end and cannot get past the first co-op stage either due to bad luck RNG with the cyclops hat man shooting off a vital part which is different each game or the servers crapping out. Given the RNG in a tower defense game it feels like no matter how well you play he can still smash through your most vital spots at random without notice in the middle of a wave and thats all it takes. Hard to recover on wave 30 when half the island disappears. Needs Co-Op work for the Co-Op fanbase but still a fun game in singler player for hardcore tower defense fans. 6/10			"

												A little very worthy Tower Defense game. Quick to learn but hard to domain, decent and colorful graphics. No story or main campaign, only has few maps with highly increasing difficulty to choose. Good and fun, but maybe with a brief variety of towers and units. Sometimes you can lost the cursor of sight by the battle effects and the own towers, whose upgrades are rough to appreciate at simple view. Against AI only first level is easy, third is nearby to impossible, six results excessively perfect for common human being; nine is recognized as cheater and continue only worth to hardcore players.

												PvP Tower Defense RTS with steampunk robots.The very idea of PvP TD, and how it's executed here, is flat-out amazing and innovative. This deserves the thumbs-up on its own, in my opinion.In a technical sense, the game seems very stable; I haven't encountered any problems that I can think of. I haven't played online yet, but LAN works well.			"

Even though it took a few tries, it's really simple once you start understanding the game so no worries.			"

												I really didn't pay any attention to this game when I picked it up in a bundle last year. Idled for cards, made some money. My son actually played it, then challenged me to a match. I've got to say its a pretty fun game. The jist of it is that you play tower defense against your opponent while also sending waves of units against them. There is gold from mining and battlepoints from sending units (more BP the longer they last on the map). You need both. Towers and units are bought with gold, upgrades are bought with BP, and units are unlocked with both.What I find interesting is that you need to balance sending out lots of units to get upgrades, and you need to keep your maze strong to stop enemy units from getting BP for upgrades.The main downside to this game is that there are some fairly predictable setups that will win matches against players that expect a regular TD game. If you find an opponent that uses a similar setup, the game can progress, but otherwise its usually quite one sided.Overall, I think its a fun game, with some features that make it different from the rest of the TD out there.

												Many people didn't get the point of this game. Yes it might not be so obvious for new players and means that you must perseverate to learn the basics. Ok the single player content is poor... Well it's already a blessing there is one. Come on people, game used to be 10 times harder and with 10 times less content! Do you need everything to be explained? There are fan videos out there! The whole strength of this game lies with the multiplayer. It is one of the most addictive game I have played in the past 10 years. Those guys are better than many top notch studios. They got the point. Keep it simple yet deep. One of the main reason why people don't buy the game is because of the 59/100 rating this website gives. But still there are many strong opponents out there. Many new players too. Try it out, you won't regret it! See you in-game!			"

												Good idea, badly done...  with a nasty on-line learning curve.its a Co-op tower defence game it has no single player/storyyou can play online 1v1 2v2 3v3 or play vs AI on endlessEndless vs the AI, you build a maze you upgrade your towers, your having fun then WHAM a god like entity wipes out half your towers, you sigh rebuild and then WHAM he destroys a part of the map!!!  at this point your original maze is ♥♥♥♥ed half your towers do ♥♥♥♥ all so you sell and carry on, then WHAM a new Creep spawn point in the middle of the map...I see how this adds challenge but.. honestly it just feels Random, and a touch fustrating after 30 mins to see it all wiped out, if he does his crap in a bad place its just game over, you start building clusters of towers in pointless places just hoping he will wipe them out...On-line 1v1 2v2 3v3 is where is really comes alive, your able to spawn your own creeps onto the opposing players map, get battle points to upgrade them based on how long your creeps last, unlock new Units, and upgrade mines giving more money for your own towers and upgrade your main base.  It has 2 nice little talent trees.My first 2v2 game was against 2 totally new players like myself, we both built huge complex mazes and played for about 30-40 mins unlocking the top Creeps and fully upgrading them, we won because our maze was a little better and we timed our creeps on Skype to be released at the same time in one big wave at the end.Fun game....our 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th game was against people who could play, they build 5-6 towers in a blob at the start of the map then blobed up at the start with no attempt to build any sort of maze.....  these towers killed our creeps before they got on the map, we had no Battle points, and could do ♥♥♥♥ all... no upgrades, no mines, no money, no new creeps......  Crushed 4 times ???????????Since you need Battle points to get better units to Get battle points.... the knock on effect is game breaking.A little google told us that most games are won or lost in the first 45-90 seconds (waves unlock after 45 seconds then every 45) and the game is about building towers that kill units before they get close to the map.... tower defence....  nope...  not in this gamesooo game 6 we built 5 towers at the start but one of there units got on the map, none of ours did GG we loose tho it takes 15 mins to play it out.Game 7, we build 6 towers at the start, 45 seconds, we kill all there units, one of the Opposing players leaves he sees its a clear win... we play on for 15 mins, vs the holdout for the win.Playing a little on-line on my own told the same story, no VoIP sucks and most games...  you win or loose after the first 90 seconds and people just Quit after that since quitting doesn't drop your On-line ranking????This game really needs VoIP since your really need to communicate with the other player, it also needs some sort of marking system because 2 people building there own idea of the perfect maze when you can't sell each others towers...... ""Can you please sell that lightning tower 4 off from the middle, on the left, 2 down from that flame tower, NO NOT THAT ONE""This game is a real shame, you can unlock creeps with heavy armour, that need to be countered with cannons, Creeps with heavy shields that need lightning towers to counter them, creeps that increase the waves run speed/health/drop aoe healing.... it even has fun mega lava fortress towers.... none of these really see any action, since the Battle point starvation tactic beats....  everythingI am not sure how they can fix this.

												Tower Wars is another fun while it lasted tower defense game... you'll play it for a while ... leave ... come back to it.  This one has really good graphics and is set in a medieval/modern world.  Narrator dialogue has the right amount of humor... new twists on weaponry & upgrades are also good.  Multiplayer is also fun.  The upgraded graphics in this tower defense game will tax a normal video card as is reflected in some of the comments in the community HUB.  However, I have had no issues or crashes... the game looks/runs very well, but I am running a 4G video card :-)I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys to play/collect tower defense games... it's a good one to have in library.

All you can do so far if you want to play solo is to try and have fun with that diminishing single player version of the game called ""classic tower defense"" which basically strips away everything that makes this game so fun and leaves you to play (in just 3 very small maps) against endless waves of enemies while being timed by a stopwatch... Pretty lame... Trust me...So IF you are looking for an ONLINE ONLY game and you are cool with it, Tower Wars can be real fun... Otherwise, if you value a nice singleplayer challange look elsewhere...

												This game is kind of interesting with it's dualing tower defence kind of gameplay, but the game itself feels incomplete. The number of towers is small, with most of them being useless, the upgrades are negligable, and the gameplay simply lacks satisfaction as 90% of the enemies fall not to all your carefully placed traps, but make it through to the final ""fine we'l kill them for you"" part of the map. Single player is a joke. I had the whole path triple layered in every kind of usefull tower and a majority of the enemies made it through unscathed. It might be better in multiplayer, but the game sure as hell doesn't stand up on it's singleplayer.The steampunk caught my eye and I was disapointed in that regard, too. It feels really lacking in overall design. Levels (at least the first few I tried) feel baren, the enemies are creative only in close ups, and the actual defences don't really have any substance to them.Overall, I'd rather just play a free flash game.

												I bought this game after looking up some multiplayer gameplay. I saw people playing on teams against other players, so assumed it would be possible to play on a team against an AI opponent, because what tower defense game wouldn't let you play against the AI? The only co-op vs AI option is one single map that plays nothing like the regular game. I guess I should have done more research. If you are buying this game for anything but the competitive pvp aspect then give it a pass, because that's all there is.			"

												It's tower defense with user-built mazes, on a hex map, against a real or simulated opponent. You get to build your own creeps and send them out to hit the enemy's defenses. This sounds really good in theory, and is basically the only way to structure multiplayer so that both players are defending at the same time. That said, I don't like playing tower defense games multiplayer, and the simulated opponent means there's no fast forward button. The tech trees and the overall system are really strange, and I didn't like them.Buy it if multiplayer tower defense with mazes is your jam. This game was well made, it's just not my thing.			"

Really, a review is pretty pointless, since you'll already know if you'll enjoy it or not...unless you haven't played a Tower Defense game, in which case don't get this and play one on Kongregate instead.In any case, if you didn't like Tower Defense before, this isn't going to make you like it.

												This game seemed to promise potential, but instead it feels like gunk. Maybe I have just lost interest in this, but thought that maybe this would reinvigorate it. It does not. There to me seems to be very little interesting diversity. The types of towers you can make can each be upgraded, and all of it is very neat and tidy, but there is just something unfortunate about how unbearably ""Realistic"" it is. I don't want cannons and arrows and fans, not beyond the initial ""early stages"" gameplay. I want monkeys wth laser-beams coming out of their eyes, I want dragon-roosts, I want Lich-towers that spam some wierd slimey crud and you don't really know nor care what it actually is, but only that it does good damage against certain armor types.The game doesn't move fast enough, and at the same time, it is like trying to crush ants with a hammer. Everything about this game is very polished, but unfortunately too artificial. I suppose that I am looking for something that reminds me of something from a previous era, and I am obviously just sore that this wasn't it.  5/10.			"

												Addicting game for all gamer levels; however, I would say this is definitely for more of the hardcore Tower Defense players. Can get very competitive really fast inquiring about borderline rage quits (LOL). It has bit of a unique style of playing in hex placement tiles instead of free roam tower placement pattern. Towers have upgrades along with units, stats for units and stats for income. Objective is to destroy the other person's castle or Rook type building that contains mini defenses(where are upgradable too). Games can last up to an hour depending on how equal skilled you and your opponent are.			"

												Mein ursprüngliche gepostetes Review erschien unter:www.LetsPlayPromotion.comhttp://www.letsplaypromotion.com/tower-wars-review/----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tower-Defense Games sind immer so eine Sache. Entweder sind sie von den Farben her zu knallig, inhaltlich zu abgedreht, zu langatmig, zu schwer, zu schnell usw. usw. Für einen echten Nörgler kann die Liste nicht lang genug sein. Erfreulicherweise konnte ich mich bisher vor allen selbstgemachten Negativerfahrungen bewahren, da ich bis zum Test von „Tower Wars“ eine wahre Tower-Defense Jungfrau war. Daher kann ich vorab sagen, dass mich das Game mehr als positiv überrascht hat. Aber kommen wir doch erst einmal dazu, was die Damen und Herren von SuperVillain Studios so geschaffen haben.TOWER WARS REVIEW – WAS IST DAS EIGENTLICH?Nach kurzer Spielzeit wurde für mich eines sofort deutlich. Tower Wars ist ein ordentliches Tower-Defense Game, mit ordentlich Zack! Aber kommen wir doch erst mal zum Inhalt. Obwohl ich an dieser Stelle langatmig die Mechanik eines Tower-Defense Spiel erklären könnte…. ach was solls. Wie man vielleicht aus dem englischen Ableiten kann, beinhalten Tower-Defense Games Türme und Abwehr. Kombiniert man das ganze kommt man schnell auf den Trichter, dass die Türme als Mittel zum Zweck verwendet werden. Und zwar um seine eigene Basis vor den anrückenden Gegenerhorden zu verteidigen um parallel dazu, mit seinen eigenen Truppen, dass gegnerische Lager bis auf die Grundmauern niederzubrennen. Klingt das nicht schön? Nicht nur ähnlich, sondern exakt so, geht es auch in Tower Wars zu. Kommen wir daher also mal zum eigentlichen Spiel.TOWER WARS – GAMEPLAYIm Großen und Ganzen ist Tower Wars sehr simpel aufgebaut. Man hat neben dem Tutorial (welches verhältnismäßig lang, humorvoll ist und auf angenehme Weise die Spielmechanik erklärt) weitere Spielmodi wie z.B. den Multiplayer und der Kampf gegen die künstliche Intelligenz. Bevor man ein Spiel gegen Mensch oder KI startet, empfiehlt es sich das Tutorial zu spielen. Hier werden alle wichtigen Spielmechaniken erklärt und dies auf eine sehr humorvolle Art und Weise. Wir lassen jetzt mal unsere Fantasie spielen und stellen uns vor, wir sind im Game. Was jetzt? Im Endeffekt ist das Spielprinzip sehr einfach. Man selber (als auch der der Feind) hat eine eigene Basis, die durch das Setzen von Türmen, vor den heranrückenden Feinden beschützt werden soll. Dazu hat man eine Auswahl an unterschiedlichen Türmen. Egal ob es sich dabei um überdimensionale Armbrüste handelt, Teslaspulenartige Türme die an die Zeiten von Command & Conquer erinnern, oder riesenhafte Katapulte für Distanzangriffe. Tower Wars bietet alles! Türme haben in Tower Wars allerdings noch eine weitere Funktion. Neben der Verteidigung dienen sie auch als Möglichkeit, um die KI vor ihrer vorgegebenen Marschroute abzulenken. So laufen die Gegner immer auf einer exakt vorgegebenen Route lang, die im Spiel entweder blau oder rot markiert ist. Durch das setzen der Türme, kann diese Route entsprechend verlängert werden, was auch nötig ist. Der Feind baut im Laufe des Spiel größere und stärkere Einheiten, was ein Risiko für den Durchbruch der eigenen Verteidigungslinie immens erhöht. Neben dem Bau von Türmen ist es allerdings auch möglich eigene Einheiten zu bauen. Dies wird ermöglicht durch Gold und Battlepoints. Gold lässt sich einfach in den umliegenden Minen absammeln, während Battlepoints durch blutige Schlachten gewonnen werden können. Neben dem Einheitenbau lassen sich mit Battlepoints und Gold auch Upgrades erkaufen um die feindliche Basis noch schneller zu stürmen. TOWER WARS – GRAFIK UND SOUNDWas lässt sich schon sagen. Ich persönlich finde die Grafik sehr gelungen. SuperVillain Studios ist ein Indie Studio welches nicht über ein Budget von mehreren Millionen Dollar verfügt, daher ist das was dem Konsumenten präsentiert wird mehr als ausreichend. Es gibt keine groben Ecken und Kanten und mir sind bisher keine groben Grafikpatzer aufgefallen. Der Sound ist allerdings erste Sahne! Neben den klangvollen Geräuschen ist insbesondere die Vertonung der Stimmen PERFEKT gelungen. Selten habe ich einen so hervorragenden, englischen Akzent in einem Videospiel erleben dürfen. Einfach nur herrlich. FAZITMachen wir es kurz und schmerzlos. Tower Wars ist ein überaus gelungener Indie Titel von SuperVillain Studios, der sich nicht hinter anderen Tower-Defense Spielen zu verstecken brauch. Das Gameplay ist schnell, manchmal vielleicht etwas zu schnell. Mit etwas Übung und stimmiger Aufteilung seiner Türme ist die erste Defense Line geschaffen, wodurch erst mal brav Battlepoints gesammelt werden können. Tower Wars ist auf Steam erhältlich und dies sogar in mehreren Versionen. Während eine Kopie des Spiels schlappe 7,99 Euro kostet, ist das Tower Wars Team Pack, bestehend aus drei Kopien, für 19,90 Euro zu haben. Für Tower-Defense Fans sollte das Spiel durch die unterschiedlichen Spielmodi  lange Spaß machen. Ansonsten eignet es sich durch den Preis von 7,99 Euro auch wunderbar zu giften.Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass Tower Wars ein spaßiges Spiel für Einsteiger ist, welches besonders durch seinen Humor und Preis beeindruckt. Daher verteile ich für Tower Wars ganze vier von fünf Sternen.			"

												Tower Wars is a title that launched pretty successfully, and got the thumbs up from players and critics. Unfortunately, due to awful handling of multiplayer rankings and accounts, unwarranted bans and poor tutorial elements, this one started rolling down the ratings hill shortly after release, and has come to rest somewhere near the bottom.Most of the problems of this game stem from handling of multiplayer, and while there are strong reasons not to buy it, there is also a fantastic hex-based strategic tower defence game here for the right players.HighlightsTower Wars has a great art style and hero gimmicks, and the hex based placement atop towering maps works really well visually. The gameplay is also new and unique enough for the genre that it does stand out a little. Most importantly, the gameplay is genuinely fun and has some strategic elements, resource management, and more. There are plenty of things to think and worry about while playing each game.* Detailed statistics, unit and damage reports at the end of the match help you understand how you're playing* Two types of economy and battle mechanics mean that balancing elements of your battlefield is key, and changes from match to matchMistakesThe vast majority of Tower Wars' problems stem from crappy handling of multiplayer. At the time of review, multiplayer is all but dead unless you play Ranked matches, and many players simply don't care about the ladder.The landscape of multiplayer on the Ranked system is frankly a horrible mess. The nature of games means that your first few moves in a multiplayer game can determine whether you'll win or lose. In games like Starcraft, for example, you can make a decisive early move, but the seasoned enemy can overcome it with their skill. In Tower Wars this isn't the case, and you can sometimes tell you've lost a game after just a handful of moves.Couple that with the fact that there are people abusing the ranking system by intentionally losing matches and reducing their ranking, just to play against easier opponents, for whatever reason, and you, as a new player, will encounter basically 2 types of matches:* Your opponent is drastically better than you and will stomp you in the first few moves* Your opponent is drastically better than you but is intentionally losing their ranking score, so will let you kill them within the first few movesThis makes the game all but pointless in multiplayer for most, and is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. The only realistic approach, for many, is finding friends or groups who still play this game, but due to the problems mentioned above, those are now very rare.As for single player, it has problems too:* There's no compelling reason to keep playing single-player other than the gameplay. If you don't enjoy playing games for their own sake, there's no new units, new abilities or interesting changes to keep you playing other than a different map and a harder difficulty.* The A.I. difficulty is extremely hard in the final single-player levels, and may be too much even for a committed playerRecommendationsPriced at just £5.59/7.99€/$7.99, Tower Wars clocks in at around 3-4 hours gameplay in the single-player campaign, and would be really good value for money if there were an active multiplayer. Unfortunately the public multiplayer is all but a waste of time unless you are a glutton for punishment, or you can find people to play with.* There are some fantastic multiplayer guides and tutorials from the community which may make uneven multiplayer worth suffering through for some* Tower Wars has Steam Workshop support, but is almost empty and can be ignored, but does offer a couple extra maps for those inclined			"

												So I just uninstalled this game.  Thanks Devs for the waste of time and money.  I have spent hours playing this game, having read tutorials and threads on these forums seeking help and tips and still cannot beat level 5 bot.  I have refrained from posting my thoughts previously and parked the game for a while before coming back to it but each experience just leaves me frustrated.  I am all for a learning curve and progression of difficulty but at the moment the bots are such are barrier to newer players that I have not even bothered getting into a multiplayer game as I feel I will be stomped.  If your intention as Devs was to infuriate and isolate many new players (I realise it's not all thanks Sherlocks) then you have succeeded far and above what anyone could have expected.  If your intention was to provide a learning mechanism for the game and make newer players feel welcome into the game then you have failed miserably at the first step.What's worse is that despite months and months of similar complaints the same issues still remain and the devs and the player base who have cracked the code will defend it completely thus proving more of a barrier to new players.Broken game, waste of money.

												The tower select menu seems like it's made for a console not a PC. Ruins the game for me. Multiplayer TD games need to be fast paced for selecting towers, with good hotkey options. This game only has them for offense, not defense. Worth it only if it's more than 80% off, otherwise don't bother. Matches are too long too, I don't need it to be Starcraft micro intense, but a VS tower defense game needs to pick up the pace.			"

												Every time I try to play this game i'm reminded that it is unbalanced such that the enemy is capable of getting half the upgrades in the game, while having better mines, and sending many more units per wave. Meanwhile I am somehow unable to build even the slightest of successful ""mazes"", because the enemy is able to walk second tier units straight through despite me having multiple cannon towers spread throughout my maze along with many arrow towers.The only way to win seems to be pure attrition, forcing you to barely kill waves of enemies until you eventually unlock the last unit because only he is strong enough to make it anywhere through the bots maze.Speaking of which, somehow the bots mazes consist of a fraction of the towers I build, with seemingly no upgraded towers, but they are able to easily defeat entire waves of units that I send in moments.

												This game wasn't the most terrible game I ever played. However, it has a lot of glaring flaws in how it was designed. First you aren't given enough money to begin with to really implement any real strategy. So it becomes a race between either making sure your enemy never gets a single minion through or sending as many through as possible and winning before your enemy does with minimal defenses. The defenses also are not well designed at all. They only work well all used together meaning there are points in a match that feel slow because of this. Not only that but the defenses just feel weak overall. As opposed to the mod this game was based on, The WC3 map Tower Wars. Everything in the game is in between either being too cheap or too expensive. Getting more income should always be devilishly expensive because it is basically their version of upgrading your tier like in most RTS. It is just too cheap in this game. Meanwhile some upgrades are either too cheap or too expensive. Which leads to totally unfair advantages during the mid point of the game. With no real way to win in a realistic amount of time for a long game. Honestly the game would be much better if they only balanced it better as most of the problems I have with it is just the balance. The game has too much depth in areas too. The game should be a little more simple. Like there is no need to upgrade specific troops in stats, if you can already upgrade all troops in the game in a seperate menu. Instead they should have maybe had 3 levels or so, and unlock abilities instead. The progression of tiering up your sends should be much longer too, so that weaker sends have a point to them. Towers and Sends should all be much stronger as well so it is actually fun playing the game. Towers need much more depth to them as well as having customizable tiers for defense only make sense if the sends can be. The Towers don't even feel like they are from the same game. These are all the problems the game has and the only real upside I can give it is that it is fun to play once in a while with friends. However, once you both learn the meta of the game it can get really boring.			"

												This game started out fun but got sour real quick.  I love tower defense games but this one deceived me.  The tutorial was informative and made the game appear simple and fun.  Then jump into a regular match against the bots and BANG.  TOLLOLOL!  The bots will own you on the first match.  I mean, c'mon!  First level shouldn't be that much of a challenge.  All my weapon, gold etc was low, which is normal starting out.  Then you look on the bot's side and it's plopping down towers and their miners are getting extra gold.  That not very fair that the computer gets a head start like that.  I can only send out a few of my soldiers at a time but shortly after the bots are sending upgraded soldiers in large numbers.  My castle fell before I could even get my troops to the enemy castle.  Don't buy this game.  It's not fun if you can't win from an unfair game.			"

												Even at a sale price of $3.49 for 2 copies this game is tremendously overpriced. Every menu or change of screen comes with a complementary wait time of 1-2 minutes.  I know it doesn’t sound like much but when you have to wait 1 minutes to start a lobby, 1 minutes to select a map, 1 minutes to go back to the lobby, 1 minute to click on ready you’ve already spent more time navigating menus then you will enjoying this game.What a terrible tutorial. Confusing at the best of times and giving you absolutely no direction or guidance at the worst.  Once you click on everything you possibly can you’ll figure out what each button does and how the game works. Thanks tutorial for teaching me independence and disappointment.I would suggest throwing $3.50 in nickels across the room and picking them up again, you’ve have more fun, you won’t have to wait 10 minutes trying to navigate through a terrible lobby only to give up when both of you can’t ready up, and you’ll still have your $3.50.

												Aesthetics and tutorial aside, I cannot recommend this game, unless you're getting for a very low prize.Game can be simply summed up ""which of the players clicks faster"" or just times specific selections correctly,Regardless, end result is going to be either of the sides simply just watching to lose without being able to do anything because of the ""match-ending""-upgrades that simply nullifies the towers.Because at the moment it's just whomever maxes the mines first wins because all you'd need to do afterwards is to spam waves.This game certainly needs a ""sabotage""-feature to have any sort of element to have ""tides turned"" (E.G. you're not able to destroy the tower setup of your opponent to get a slight breach and gain ""Battle Points"").I was partially wishing there was a feature I'd be familiar with from ""Rampart""; unfortunately there was none.""Toy Soldiers - Complete is a game I recommend instead...

Likewise the Devs seem to have written it off or otherwise are MIA for a couple months it seems, so maybe on the verge of being a victim of abandonment.

												On first glance you may not think this game isn't really fun.  It is.  I don't know enough about computer processing to explain the details you need to get this game to run smooth, all I can tell you is that it runs beautifully on my Windows Surface Pro 3.  What I can tell you is that it is a whitty game that breaks the fourth-wall (For those of you who don't know:The Fourth Wall is a term in entertainment when the character has a thought about the watcher, or user sometimes in the form of ""I wonder if this is some kind of games and we are all just pawns""  or the characters just outright acknowledge you as a player in a sense that you aren't apart of their universe)  It can be quite fun, and is a good time waster if your at work and want two hours to kill.  The singleplayer is mainly versing higher level intelligence bots, not much to it, but if your that type of person thats easy to please, and doesnt need complexity it can be really enjoyable.  Also I do know it takes a long time to find a match in PvP.  If you play with a friend it is better.  Overall  the fact that this game is a time-waster (in a goodway) and has achievements is great!  I personally like to achievement hunt, but the fact that a smaller game with not so difficult achievements gives me a break, and its just interesting to see what objectives the game will amek you complete.   However, if you are not good with focus, or multitasking I DO NOT reccomend this game for you as you will get frustrated with trying to build and upgrade defenses, also trying to make them into a maze.  Dispatch troops, and upgrade that aswell. And finally trying to upgrade your gold mines and castles at the same time.			"

												Tower Wars has you playing the role of the aggressor and defender simultaneously. As you create towers throughout the hexagonal spaces that’s in your lands, you also spawn your army from a barracks which travels to their lands. I liked this idea, but then felt that the developers had tried to include too much in the game. With a dozen different towers and units to use, you have upgrades for each individual tower, upgrade trees for your units and towers, upgrade trees for your barracks and castle, two resources to use for towers, units and upgrades; several different mines to gain resources which can each be upgraded individually… ok so there’s too much to upgrade.The main problem for me was that the game wasn’t engaging enough to keep me playing. Maybe a single-player campaign would have been enough to keep me playing. While game might be complex, the learning curve is still decent, just finicky. Aesthetically the game was OK, Steampunk being something that can never get old, but generally not enough to make a game great. This all being said, I never tried the multiplayer which is the game’s focus… so maybe I missed the fun part.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/02/21/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-tower-wars/ "

												First of all: I like the game mechanics, the theme and the visual and acoustic presentation of the game!Why not give a positive review then? In short: The sum of several smaller problems. Read on for details.1.) I bought a 3-pack to play coop. The game description says it has singleplayer & coop and it does. But it is clearly focussed on PvP (1v1, 2v2, 3v3) and the other modes seem like 2nd-class citizens. There is just a single coop level & mode - disappointing.2.) The UI does not work well for me, both in input and output. The tower placing mechanism is error prone. Several hours of playing (and watching the UIs feedback) did not lead me to defeat one of the simpler bots. Reading steam community guides for a couple of minutes allowed me to even compete with players. 3.) 2 years after release i still encountered 3 bugs, 1 of which tipped a head-to-head pvp match to my opponents favor by not allowing me to place towers where i needed them (they could legally be placed there).Edit: Reduced UI critic, as the info i was lacking to suceed is present and i just never recognized it.

												I wanted to at least like this game but the combination of essentially no single player game (it's there but pathetically little of it and not much fun), astonishingly poor performance on my AMD system (8fps at times and a UI that punishes you for that) and a pace best described as glacial - it got boring real fast.Firmly PvP only and too slow for me.

												well the game is a fun mess around and a good allround timekiller but i definetly wouldent recommend buying it it took me half an hour to get a multiplayer game and of that you wouldent assume the game was going to crash when it loaded even when loading the game it can take a few minuites to load properly as of the classic TD well its a waste of time ive played plenty it simply lacks the overall cutomization of a good tower defense all you do is plop down towers and wait after a while the board is full of maxed towers and you do.... nothing rather boring after awhile for the bots well there bots easy to predict you quite literaly can see through there next plan and make them do anything you want the ai for them will spam anything it wants dispite how usless this may be the game may not be the worst but lacking a miltiplayer and steaight up TD elements i dont recomend buying it unless it is on offer for at least 50% off and by the time that happens it will be dead			"

												У этой игры нет нормального лобби. Такой недостаток может быть не смертельным для Orcs Must Die, которые можно проходить соло, но не для созданной для мультиплеера ""башенной"" стратегии. Если у вас нет друга, который будет с вами регулярно играть через инвайты, можете забить на покупку игры. Режим выживания лишен каких-либо свежих идей вообще.			"

												I've played a lot of tower wars games in the past from the Warcraft III era and this one is simply too average. For the price, it could have more maps, more attention to the user interface as well as new features, such as RACES TO CHOOSE FROM or some kind of challenge mode where you get some game rolling and have to work your way out.I bought the game under a sale, but aside from the hours it got me hooked, I don't feel like replaying it because the maps are always the same, the voices are always the same and you'll end up looking for the same tactics not mattering the randomly placed mines.This game could use more attention.

Posted: March 29, 2014
												Summary: Misleading, poorly designed clickfestDetail:Taking a look at the cartoonish, over-the-top graphics, one gets the impression that this is a family friendly, childish (in a good way) game, great for relaxing and enjoying some simple cartoon destruction with a laid back style and maybe mild challenges.  Going through the not-very-detailed tutorial, the joking dialogue confirms your impression.  When the guidance is complete (having forced you forward so you couldn't really watch the effects of what you were told to do since the action was off the screen while the text pop-ups prevented you from scrolling), however, and you are told to defeat the AI that was allegedly designed to be laughably simple, you eerily discover that it is strangely not so easy.Brushing it off and moving on to the first opponent AI, the real game quickly shows itself.  Still not really sure when you are supposed to use which towers and units (i.e. what the strengths are meant to be), you are left to figure it out in real-time.  A bit of delay and boring start ensues, but the pace quickly picks up.  Expect to loose if you actually try to take the time to read the in-game descriptions for each unit and tower to learn as the AI rapidly ramps up its waves.  I am quite a tower game rookie, but since the game gives the impression that it would fit well for that situation, it is telling that I lost 3 or 4 times until beating the very first AI opponent (then beating the second on the first try since the design is so repetative before giving up on the third from the stupidity).  Most annoying is the fact that there is no time to really think about how to lay out your towers, the waves come too fast, you have to memorize the map and already know what to do.  The fact that single player was an after-thought is quite evident given that, pathetically, there is nothing even as simple as a game speed adjustment.  So while the AI happily processes away at the speed of electricity, its all on you to try to out-click it - the single biggest factor in destroying the potential enjoyability of the game - it is nothing but rushing to keep up.  If you step back and think about it, though, that really is the only way to make it ""challenging"", since the fixed, hex based maps are so pathetically constraining, there really is only one effective way to force the path through the ""maze"" at a high level, all you can do is select which towers to construct where.Which brings us to the next point.  How do you know which towers you really need?  Well it depens on what troops are being sent after you.  Do they have lots of shields? Armor? Health?  Can you watch and see how effective or ineffective your towers are?  NO!!, you can't!  When you click on a menu to bring up your options, the game forces your screen to look at a certain area.  For instance, if you bring up your castle, your screen MUST look at it, ditto your mines, etc., therefore you cannot browse through and think about upgrades while also watching the assault in the background.  If you try to go around upgrading, you will suddenly have an attacker at your castle door with ample shields and not a clue where you need to add tower strength to prevent it.  If you sit on your hands while watching the action so that you can see where your weaknesses are, you won't have time to actually implement the necessary changes.Then there is the fact that Every. Single. Time. you launch your troops, the ""king"" announcer randomly picks one of 2 or 3 lame and incredibly repetitive and annoying phrases to say when you are already frustrated at yet another ""strategy"" game that has almost no strategy (or even tactics), replacing it with yet another round of who can click the fastest.I could rant on, but I have wasted enough of my own life on both the game and this review already.  I have not had a Steam account very long, but this is the first game I have uninstalled without beating.  Quite surprising given the lousy 5 (simplistic) maps and 10 AI opponents you have to select between, yet another misleading indicator for this poorly designed game and its confused developers.			"

												Basically this game is a tower defense/wave attack. You build towers to defend and manage units to send in a wave against an opponent while building up your mines (for gold) and upgrades for your units/towers. One game will take more than an hour to complete as you can made a ridiculously good and long maze that nothing will get through. 90% of this game is sitting around and frankly I have better things to do with my time.

												Half-way interesting hook with being able to program waves against your opponent while having to build your own defenses out of the same bank.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't work.  Get behind, and you're done.  One incredibly annoying thing for me is that the tower placement radial menu was clearly designed for console controller coolies/joysticks.  It's perfectly radial, and expects you to move the mouse in a perfect circle.  And there are no hotkeys to replace the radial that I've found.Devs who don't bother to optimize for PC and then post to Steam don't deserve support.			"

												BUYER BE WARNED.  BUYER BE WARNED.  BUYER BE WARNED.  BUYER BE WARNED.Runs like absolute hell on just about anyone's PC once you get your map about half full of towers.  A single wave that once took seconds can stretch for several minutes!  I have an AMD Phenom Quad Core Black Edition and Nvidia Geforce something-something Kepler card with 2GB of RAM on it.  Skyrim with very high settings and added graphics mods never dips down this low.  If you can get over performance issues, it's all-in-all not a bad title.  Kind of on the difficult side, but once you figure out how to play the game it's kind of refreshing... if only it ran exactly twice as well as it does.

												The single-player part of the game is limited.  Once you get past the tutorial there is not much replay value for single players.  This detail wouldn't be an issue if the multi-player element wasn't so horrible.  The game play is not balanced.  If you want to win, spend some time on the internet to discover the couple of build orders it takes to win.  There is no strategy involved, just be the fastest to click on the correct buttons at the appropriate time.  A champanzee could be trained to play the game.			"

												The game instantly reminded me of Castle Fight - a Warcraft 3's mod map. Unfortunately it's still lacking many things, including but not limited to Good AI, more campaign maps (solo play) and missions. Would've been a good one if it was released from the start so as the game would have been more popular than it is now.There's only three or so missions/maps for solo play including one tutorial. If you expect to play alone... don't think about it too much. UPDATE: There's now single player content. Horrayyyyyyyyyy!Multiplayer aspect is pretty much dead. Arrange a match with friend before you jump into multiplayer. If you can find someone with same skill level, well, I guess it's fun.Learning curve is surprisingly not that hard. There's still a learning curve, but from what I can see, not as steep as Castle Fight. Also there's little teamwork required unlike in Castle Fight so yeah... You just need to send your units (controlled by AI after you launch them) into enemy's castle and simultaneously defend you castle by making maze (hello Sanctum 1). When engaging enemies, you earn points that you can use to hire workers to obtain more gold, upgrade your tech trees to obtain more units and make them stronger. Rinse and repeat - don't forget to keep creating maze.Typical tower defense stuffs, heh.All in all, a promising game but lacking execution and less polished. Despite the workshop implemented already, there's little to none content in it. Sad, but that's true. Maybe with longer developer supports and a few sales here and there the game can be improved and has bigger player base.			"

												Just purchased a 3 pack to play this with a few friends only to find that It refuses to load past the menus. The system I'm running can max out most if not all games that are currently out, yet to get past the menus of Tower Wars it takes me 4 minutes. This shouldn't be stated as a full release as It's bugged to hell, you can play the Single Player by setting Steam to Offline Mode but who wants to do that when a game was initially released as Multiplayer only?0/10.

												This game has a serious User Interface problem. It struggles to communicate even the most basic things for the Tower Defence genre. For example: when you are going to place a tower, the menu that shows tower placement options actually gets in the way of the range indicator for the towers. Also, the tower placement menu is only visible for as long as you hold the mouse button down; and if you accidentaly misclick a tile, that counts as pressing the button (to show the menu) and releasing it (to select an action i.e. placing a tower), which means you'll built lots of towers by mistake. The buttons in the interface are way too small, there are no information tooltips for most of them (what the hell does the exclamation mark do exactly? It turns red when I click it, but that's it). The fonts are ugly and inconsitent. The creeps' HP bars are hard to read. The pathing of the creeps is smart, but it doesn't show you how it will change until you actually place your towers, so you have to think extra hard before you do anything. Even deleting units from your units queue is painfully hard, you have to double click each individual unit (also, this information is nowhere to be found, I figured it out by mistake). Seriously, the developers need to take a cold, hard look at their User Interface and User Experience. The game is frustrating before it even starts. These interface issues were enough to make my experience (with a friend, actually) a nightmare, to the point where I ragequitted a co-op game that I was winning. Aside from that, I'd say that the game actually tries to be funny (in the tutorial and in all the tips and vocal taunts), but really it is not. And bad comedy is worse than no comedy at all.The more I think about this game, the more I find things to hate about it. Having two different resources seems like a good idea in theory, but it sucks in game. There are loads of options everywhere and on everything, but most of them are not actually viable - they're useless clutter. You have 3 mines (where you get your resources from) and you can upgrade each one individually. Why? Why not have just one place to control your resource gathering? By the way, the ""Tower Defence"" aspect of this game is secondary. This is a resource-management game, pure and simple: it's about MIN/MAXING meaningless numbers on what could otherwise be an Excel sheet. Except there's a guy yelling at you trying to be a funny british king figure, and failing hard at it.This game is not worth it.			"

												I got this in a cheap deal I bought for something else, otherwise I would not buy something with bad ratings like this. It deserves every single bad review it has ever gotten. During the tutorial, THE TUTORIAL MIND YOU, the mouse got oddly locked in a small little circle in the middle of the screen locked on a tower and nothing would make it come undone. The keyboard keys also stopped responding too. Luckily I was able to ctrl+alt+del. A game that is broken and you can't even get past the tutorial. ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. And even so, from what little bit it let me play, it sucks nuts anyway. I can truly see why it got bad scores because it just sucks. I started again and did a regular SP game and it was the same as every other bad tower defense game I have ever played: you are locked into playing a very certain way or else you lose. Put the right towers in the right places by a certain amount of time with the right upgrades of tower/castle/troop combo and you can win. Anything even remotely less specific than that and you don't.♥♥♥♥ steam for letting idiot developers like this put their garbage up for sale. 1/10			"

I must say, it’s jolly good to have you on board! We need all of the fodder.... ERRR... HELP... yes, yes... all of the help we can get.” Tower Wars is a new and unique spin on the competitive multi-player tower defense genre! The game combines elements of tower defense, real-time strategy, and all-out multi-player mayhem to bring you a completely unique experience, delivered with a fun and funny not-so-old world style!

												I only spent $2, and I'm glad that was it... I'veplayed it for a few hours and it doesn't seem to have much to offer.  Granted, I haven't given PVP a try, but the AI seems to be effectively unbeatable after level 3 as I'm pretty sure it gets better resource generation than the player does.  There aren't that many selections for towers (and even with those selections, you pretty much only use 3-4 of them) and I don't think there are enough levels of tower upgrades (only 3) which means many of the AI troops can walk through all your defenses.... yet their unupgraded towers manage to decimate your troops still.Personally, I'd recommend ""Defense grid"" over this 9 days a week.

												First of all, I like this game a lot, even though its freakin hard to learn. I never played MP so far just startet like a week ago with the SP against the bots. I took me about 20 attempts to beat the easiest bot (WTF??). I played the tutorial first but this doesn't help a bit with the game mechanics. You learn the hud, thats it and then you have to go through frustrating hours against the AI unless you understand the basic mechanics like forcing enemys to spend their money on towers not troops and so on.I've been playing this for a week now and after the hard start it got a lot better. I managed to win vs the next bots in a few attempts and had a lot of fun. But now I've reached like a dead end. I'm trying to win against the AI lvl 6 and no mater how the game goes at the beginning its just frustrating to be in the lead for like 30 minutes and get bashed in like 5 minutes by suddenly unstopable waves. How can I have more income more BP stop every wave, send own, upgrade and so on and suddenly the AI becomes OVERWHELMING. Forums are filled with people talking bout how easy all the bots are and so on, but whatever. As everybody knows bot 9 and 10 are cheating. But the others are as well in a more subtle way. Having infinite APM (@developer it seems so, is it true?). And other things that don't seem to be fair. Disregarding the fact of tower placing and wave setup, my shielders always get focused whereas my towers tend to ignore them. Maybe thats just ""luck"" for the AI but nevertheless frustrating.I paid 2 bucks for a week of fun so its absolutely worth it. For people that play the MP I guess its worth it anyhow.			"

												Some tower defense games are about quality, carefully planning your tower placement and figuring out an optimal strategy, this game is about quantity, spam your opponent with towers until your computer breaks down, or until you go deaf with all the sounds your towers make. I find the controls aweful, this is a mess, recommended only if you really have time to waste.			"

												     This is the most unique tower defense game I have played, particularly in that, while having to defend against a stream of mobs, you send your own out for your enemy to defend against at the same time.  It is hectic and intense, but the game looks and plays great.     There is, of course, a classic tower defense mode as well.  It's a ton of fun, but I do wish there were more maps to choose from.     The game looks and feels like Warcraft 3 in a way, but it plays like Defense Grid with hexes rather than squares.  I love it!			"

												I really like the different mechanics of this, the art direction also has a cartoony feel while not being silly at all. Its fun to try different strategies and builds whether you want to be a loner and play vs computers, or play against real people. The one problem I have with this, is that it is non-stop, play to the finish without being able to pause or save. A save function would allow me to log much more time on this game than I have now			"

												This is the epidimy of a tower defence game, but with a twist! In this game you can either play classic tower defence with non-stop enemy waves, which includes a co-op mode or you can go head to head with a player or a computer, where both sides build towers AND send troops at the enemy team. The trick is to balance how much you spend on attack or defence. The game is a medival steampunk setting and has crisp graphics that are quite appealing- My rating 8/10 check it out  its on sale until January 3rd			"

												8/10  A well made strategy game overall. The single player is one of the reasons why I like the game and it should also be a reason for people to get it. The single player is a good way to learn how to play the game (even though there is a tutorial). You could think of different ways to try and win a game. Also there are a few maps to play on but after a while it could get repetitive and that is the reason why I rate it 8/10 and not 10/10. Besides the standard gamemode there is one more. Although the standard gamemode is better overall.  If you have a computer that just makes the requirements (like me), expect to be turning down the quality of how it runs and how it looks (the gameplay still looks pretty good though). Overall this game is not as demanding as other games for your computer.  This game is worth your time and money.			"

												I love this game. It's got all the classic elements of a good tower defence game, and the hex-based grid is awesome.Things I Like:[+] Tower defense mechanics.[+] Single Player gameplay is challenging and rewarding.[+] Hex based grid is just fantastic.[+] Gameplay is unique (as far as I'm aware anyway.)[+] The art such as tower models, and characters are very nice, as well as the maps, effects, all of it. It's very sleek. [+] Maps and the randomness created by the mines moving around each game is awesome.[+] The audio (including character voices) is amusing and well-done.[+] User Interface is generally well-designed, and amusing, and looks good.[+] The camera is perfect.Issues:[-] User Interface and I have our disagreements. I want it to go back to a menu or let me restart right after I lose angrily and it just sits there and I hit buttons to try to make it go away, until it lets me exit the current map.[-] When exiting a map that you just lost (or won), there is small text that must be clicked, and I haven't found a key on the keyboard to make it click through. I would like to be able to hit [ESC] or [ENTER] and have it go back to the menu at that point.[-] I often find myself accidentally clicking and then it defaults to building a tower where I had no intention of putting a tower, and then I am sad.[-] From what I've played it doesn't seem there's a lot of genuine strategy. You just have to balance upgrading mines, units, and global unit stats, and keep everything moving in the right direction and build a standard set of towers with as long a maze as possible. If you build some towers in large quantities, you'll lose, if you focus on one type of upgrades, you'll lose.[-] UI doesn't agree with my pen tablet entirely. when I click to upgrade a tower it clicks constantly, and sometimes does odd things, which isn't that surprising.[-] Hotkeys for things are not displayed. If I could hover over the send button and it would say something like ""[SPACE] to Send Troops"" or ""[1] to queue this troop"". Those keyboard shortcuts are useful but I only learned them through the tutorial or tips or guesswork. I like hovering over things for information.[-] Hovering over units does not give any info about what unit they are or their health. I assume that's how they planned it, but I would very much like more information at my fingertips.[-] I find it hard to build a complex maze in a hex-grid (but that said, I'd still take a hex grid any day.)Other notes:[~] Gameplay is exceedingly challenging, getting me stuck on one bot for quite some time in single-player, and I can only imagine it's even harder against real people, as I'm sure I'll find out soon. It's a very delicate balancing act. The fact that it is hard is not a bad thing though. It's just not for people who aren't up for a serious challenge, or those with lots of skill already in other tower defense games.[~] Each game can be quite long, but I enjoy long games so I don't consider this bad.[~] Full disclosure: I bought it during the summer sale, for a very low price. I do think it's worth the asking price though, for sure.Conclusion:I love this game, despite it's flaws. I love it's style, I love hexagon-based games, and I love it's mechanics. If you're looking for a fun, straightforward tower defense game, I highly recommend it. This game requires patience, and a willingness to learn.			"

												While Tower Wars puts an interesting spin on the Tower Defense genre, I really don't think it did it any great justice.Tower Wars changes up the Tower Defense genre a bit by adding in an opponent that is actively building towers just like you are and the goal is to stop him from destroying your castle, while managing to get troops through his towers to destroy his tower.The game has some interesting features and the Victorian/Steam-Punk era style is a nice touch, it really didn't make up for the shortcomings I saw/felt.  Tower Wars isn't an easy game.  In fact, I found it annoyingly difficult for no good reason.  I also found the tutorial to be lacking and the enormous plethora of available upgrades for towers, buildings and troops along with the equally enormous plethora of available towers and troops in the first place, much too daunting to get me to want to play in the slightest.I would not recommend this to anyone unless you are a true Tower Defense savant and really want to give it a shot.  I don't find it fun due to the lacking tutorial, odd difficulty and overwhelming amount of options for towers and such.			"

Also the in game performance was a lot slower than i would expect from the graphics that i was seeing.It is a good idea, but i think it is technically poorly executed.I am indie developer my self and i don't see any way how a team can accept that long loading times. Hope it get's fixed soon. It is better to fixed than optimized i think since it is way out of normal range.			"

												I don't recommend it because of one big flaw:The game is not made for pc gaming (Mouse + keyboard). It seems to be only 'optimised' for touch screen.Let me show you:ScreenshotTo build a tower you have to click and hold the mouse button, then you have to circle through a menu and release the button. Hoping you did not select the wrong one. The same setup is done for upgrading and selling, which can often lead to annoying situations.I don't like my games to be tedious. I do not understand why there is no option to change the settings: Upgrade -> shortcut u, sell -> shortcut s. Simple stuff like this.The game is quite fast paced and the interaction to build/upgrade/sell a tower is really slow because of this setup.Furthermore, I do not find the towers very balanced. The costs seem extremely mixed. Rather than different towers with different effects for roughly the same cost (Think of Kingdom Rush). So diversification of towers is more a cost matter than what troops the enemy sends you.As a result, this game could not interest me. As reflected in my playing time.			"

												Innovation lies in the ability to also attack, not just defend like other tower thisandthat games. Fun idea, and the game technically works. Although the tutorial is useless: it just says you learn by playing :).The problem lies in the gameplay. From my brief experience it seems the idea is to perfect your strategy ( maybe per map ) and then rinse and repeat. Make the enemy travel the longest way to your castle and figure out the best combination of towers and soldiers. Once you get this planned out, it seems hard for me to continue from that point on or believe there's something so strategic that you can evolve.			"

												Tower Wars offers a unique take on the tower defense strategy genre by incorporating the standard set of towers, upgrades, and abilities, with a competetive gaming approach. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:1. Steampunk-style art offers a new take on the tower defense genre.2. Gameplay is straightforward and easy to pick up. 3. Different levels and a hex based grid allows for a unique game each time you play. Cons:1. Content-wise, the game lacks diversity. There is only one set of units and the only changes in style between opposing players is color. 2. MONUMENTALLY long loading times for a small game will make you wonder if the game has frozen while spinning up a map. 3. Limited replayability as the playerbase is lacking for matchmaking/competetive play. Summary: At its current 2.00 sale price, Tower wars is a definite buy. Even if you only get about 10 games out of it before moving on to another title, this game does offer some intense competetive play - provided you have the patience to wait through the loading times.

												Tower wars is a tower defense game where you also need to attack, you can play against random people via matchmaking or you can play against your friends or with them vs bots.If you're an achievement hunter don't try this game o.o one of them requires you to be #1 on the ranking of the season.The gameplay is very simple you start with a castle which you can upgrade armor and weapons in case enemy troops reach it , 3 gold mines which you need to hire workers and upgrade for better profit, barracks where you upgrade your troops armor hp speed etc and a lot of lanes to cover.The Good part of this game is you can see where the enemy is going to walk through so you can block stairs and paths in order to make them walk the longest while your lv 3 ballistas brutally murder them.There's 2 kinds of currency in the game , one is gold used to build troops, towers and upgrade them you get it passively via gold mines , the second is battle points which you get the longest your troops survive against the enemy towers used to get newer troops , upgrade them , and hire workers at your mines.The game is very slow but enjoyable but it falls apart end game , by the time one of the teams get the ""hero"" troop he can just send 5 of them at the same time and you can bet at least 1 or 2 of them is going to reach your castle unless you're like the god of strategy, really they're that strong.Fun game recommend buying it to play with a friend not that expensive			"

In this game you can either play classic tower defence with non-stop enemy waves, which includes a co-op mode or you can go head to head with a player or a computer, where both sides build towers AND send troops at the enemy team. The trick is to balance how much you spend on attack or defence.

What more do you need to know?Ok, so you want to know more?Two sides, each one constructs a tower defense that will slow down the mindless grunts being sent by the opposing player.  Both sides do this while sending wave after wave of mindless units to attack the enemy castle.Good variety of units though some not all that useful.Overall, I like it.

Insane load times, ai bots that clearly are much stronger than they appear for single player are just a few of the things I came to dislike here.

												     This is the most unique tower defense game I have played, particularly in that, while having to defend against a stream of mobs, you send your own out for your enemy to defend against at the same time.  It is hectic and intense, but the game looks and plays great.     There is, of course, a classic tower defense mode as well.  It's a ton of fun, but I do wish there were more maps to choose from.     The game looks and feels like Warcraft 3 in a way, but it plays like Defense Grid with hexes rather than squares.  I love it!			"

												Tower wars is a tower defense game where you also need to attack, you can play against random people via matchmaking or you can play against your friends or with them vs bots.If you're an achievement hunter don't try this game o.o one of them requires you to be #1 on the ranking of the season.The gameplay is very simple you start with a castle which you can upgrade armor and weapons in case enemy troops reach it , 3 gold mines which you need to hire workers and upgrade for better profit, barracks where you upgrade your troops armor hp speed etc and a lot of lanes to cover.The Good part of this game is you can see where the enemy is going to walk through so you can block stairs and paths in order to make them walk the longest while your lv 3 ballistas brutally murder them.There's 2 kinds of currency in the game , one is gold used to build troops, towers and upgrade them you get it passively via gold mines , the second is battle points which you get the longest your troops survive against the enemy towers used to get newer troops , upgrade them , and hire workers at your mines.The game is very slow but enjoyable but it falls apart end game , by the time one of the teams get the ""hero"" troop he can just send 5 of them at the same time and you can bet at least 1 or 2 of them is going to reach your castle unless you're like the god of strategy, really they're that strong.Fun game recommend buying it to play with a friend not that expensive			"

												This is a fun game worht the money. But the biggest problem me and my friends have had with it is that there is only one co-op map. Also the giant robot guy that shows up and destroys part of the lvl or how the bombers always target your best buildings and destroys them. You get ZERO warning about it and you get NO money back when they are destroyed this way. That is the biggest problem I have with the game. I has a good design besides those problems and it is a fun game. Just needs some more work put into those areas.			"

												This game is great if you like Tower Defense games. It has a fairly unique concept in the genre of being able to make the entire maze that creeps have to travel. The PvP mode is also very well done and has a lot of micromanaging to attend to which any strategist should be able to appreciate.Where my gripes fall on this game (and this being a few weeks since I've last touched the game) is the co-op. While the one map they offer is very good, they haven't really followed up on it by offering more maps. That aside, this game is excellent from what I've seen so far. I'll be keeping an eye on it.

												This game is different from other tower defense games since it lets you defend AND attack at the same time. That's about it's only advantage.This game is below average at best. It is lacking balance, polish, it is lacking interesting upgrades, lacking transparency in numbers and stats on towers. What is the exact damage of my towers? What is the exact bonus against so and so? The game tells you nothing about the details, which is a shame considering most people who play this genre are people who like number crunching and optimising, and this game won't let you do so.But mostly what kills it for me is the lack of a ""goal"". Lack of that sens of ""am i doing good or bad? how good I am doing?"". The single player missions seem pointless, as the game does not tell you how other people did, and gives you no score or achievement to aim for. I played the first level for an hour, survived everything and upgraded everything, yet i felt like i wasted an hour... What was the point? Againt you can't compare your performance and have no point of reference, so the whole thing is an exercice in futility no matter how well you do.It seems the developers want you to jump into multiplayer and go against other people. But I do not believe that the system  is robust enough for multiplayer, the upgrades, towers, stats, units, nothing seems optimised, balanced, or even transparent in what it does and that is really unatractive for someone looking for a competitive game.Since the game is not transparent in its stats, it forces you to read guides and spend time on the forums, instead of simply playing and thinking / figuring out things for yourself (which i find is the most enjoyable aspect of tower defense games : number crunching), since i can't number crunch here i'd rather uninstall this game than rely in the community to tell me what is good and what is not. Seriously what would be the point of adopting solutions designed by others? You'd just be a bot running the cookie cutter solutions of another, instead of figuring out things for yourself. Not my idea of fun.All in all this is a tower game with a single innovative feature, but seeing as it does neither single player nor multiplayer well, there is no reason to buy it unless it gets heavily patched. Also looking at the dozen people on my friend list who bought this game, i don't see anyone who played this title for more than 2 hours, which reinforces the idea that this game is not very fun and offers very little bang for the buck.Time to uninstall this and go back to Defense Grid.

												Interesting game if you like tower defense. Very traditional.The AI, however, is a little over the top for ability, and gameplay essentially comes down to an apparently fairly specific formula; if you dont follow the formula, or something close to it, the easiest AI opponent is likely to either stomp you into the ground effortlessly, or beat your face into a deadlock depending on the map.A good TD game for grind-focused players, perfectionists, and PvP addicts who want to take a TD vacation. Or people who can think and move FAST. Not a very good game for anyone wanting to take time to enjoy some tactical thinking, DEFFINITLY not a good game for casual players unless they want to take a lot of time to get used to every shortcut the game offers.

												Tower Wars, what more is there to say? The game plays around the game mode made popular by War Craft III in which the player constructs towers in a maze to protect their base (or in this game's instance, their castle). Its a simple style of gameplay for a very casual game that can be both relaxing, or in more difficult settings absolutely intense. Unfortunately, Tower Wars fails to deliver on any of that excitement that made tower defence games so very popular in the years past.A few review note this game as being easy, others stating that it is hard. Overall, the game is easy--until you hit the absolute best in any given map in which case its a waiting game for the creeps to get strong enough to make it to your castle. Games lasting an hour or more of just waiting for your maxed out maze to finally be defeated while you sit hopeless...and bored. That is the survival mode in a nutshell--lifeless and easy. Aided with a rather terrible user interface and rather bad maps it feels uninspired and a chore to get into.There now is multiplayer too, which like one of the single player modes adds the the ability to spend gold to buy ""creeps"" to send to the oppossing player's maze. This verses style worked fantastic in days past--the perfect balance in deciding to spend money for either offencive play or defencive play. While Tower Wars continues on this great gameplay, some of the same reasons that make the single player so dry still exist in multiplayer making it one of those games which simply does not draw the player in.Sure, my ideas of tower defence games is carved from the various mods from the early days of their introduction as mods for various Blizzard games, but I gave Tower Wars a chance to work with the genre to create new and interesting gameplay and build on it. It adds hexagonal tiles, which could have resulted in amazing new ways to making new mazes, alas the maps do not even permit very complex mazes thanks to their size. I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone, especially at the asking price of $8. It quite simply falls short.			"

												This is the epidimy of a tower defence game, but with a twist! In this game you can either play classic tower defence with non-stop enemy waves, which includes a co-op mode or you can go head to head with a player or a computer, where both sides build towers AND send troops at the enemy team. The trick is to balance how much you spend on attack or defence. The game is a medival steampunk setting and has crisp graphics that are quite appealing- My rating 8/10 check it out  its on sale until January 3rd			"

												This game is fun to play with a friend, and has a decent amount of variety for your money, but it becomes increasingly dull after a 10+ hours,, as matches progress pretty much the same way every time.It has you sending units to attack your enemy's base, and building turrets to defend yours. I had fun in the versus mode with my friend Daniel, but Co-op isn't great as latency issues seem to occur frequently, even on a high speed internet connection with someone living less than a mile away from you. The Co-op doesn't quite match up to the versus mode, as I think the competitive side of versus is what makes the game fun.I give this game an 8/10, if you like Tower Defense games, you'll love this. But be sure to bring a friend as otherwise you'll get sick of this game pretty quickly.			"

												Looking at the reviews before I bought this, most of the negatives seemed to focus on how difficult it is and that it's a resource hog. Well I like difficult games and have a fairly decent PC so I discounted those factors.There is a tutorial and a single player mode (another two gripes amongst the negative reviews).However, this is one of those games made my a competent programmer with absolute no clue about UI and user experience. The method to place a tower is AWFUL. Click and hold mouse button down on a hex, rotate to your selection and release.Personally I prefer games where you don't have to 'maze'. This is like Fieldrunners in that you are free to build wherever you like on the board and route the enemies through your city of death.The game maxed out my Radeon 7950, no slowdown but the fan was full on. I guess that's a side-effect using what appears to be a third-party 3D engine with no optimisation.Oh and about that tutorial (which seemed to have been added after most of these reviews were posted): I have never heard such a lacklustre piece of voice-acting in my life. It sounds like the guy was pushed into a sound booth, a microphone shoved in his face and forced to narrate the whole thing in a terrible Mockney accent in a single take before he was allowed his first cup of coffee of the day.It was on sale but I don't even feel I got my £1.39's worth, I can't see myself playing it again.There ARE better tower defence games out there.

												Tower Wars offers a unique take on the tower defense strategy genre by incorporating the standard set of towers, upgrades, and abilities, with a competetive gaming approach. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:1. Steampunk-style art offers a new take on the tower defense genre.2. Gameplay is straightforward and easy to pick up. 3. Different levels and a hex based grid allows for a unique game each time you play. Cons:1. Content-wise, the game lacks diversity. There is only one set of units and the only changes in style between opposing players is color. 2. MONUMENTALLY long loading times for a small game will make you wonder if the game has frozen while spinning up a map. 3. Limited replayability as the playerbase is lacking for matchmaking/competetive play. Summary: At its current 2.00 sale price, Tower wars is a definite buy. Even if you only get about 10 games out of it before moving on to another title, this game does offer some intense competetive play - provided you have the patience to wait through the loading times.

												Innovation lies in the ability to also attack, not just defend like other tower thisandthat games. Fun idea, and the game technically works. Although the tutorial is useless: it just says you learn by playing :).The problem lies in the gameplay. From my brief experience it seems the idea is to perfect your strategy ( maybe per map ) and then rinse and repeat. Make the enemy travel the longest way to your castle and figure out the best combination of towers and soldiers. Once you get this planned out, it seems hard for me to continue from that point on or believe there's something so strategic that you can evolve.			"

												8/10  A well made strategy game overall. The single player is one of the reasons why I like the game and it should also be a reason for people to get it. The single player is a good way to learn how to play the game (even though there is a tutorial). You could think of different ways to try and win a game. Also there are a few maps to play on but after a while it could get repetitive and that is the reason why I rate it 8/10 and not 10/10. Besides the standard gamemode there is one more. Although the standard gamemode is better overall.  If you have a computer that just makes the requirements (like me), expect to be turning down the quality of how it runs and how it looks (the gameplay still looks pretty good though). Overall this game is not as demanding as other games for your computer.  This game is worth your time and money.			"

												I love this game. It's got all the classic elements of a good tower defence game, and the hex-based grid is awesome.Things I Like:[+] Tower defense mechanics.[+] Single Player gameplay is challenging and rewarding.[+] Hex based grid is just fantastic.[+] Gameplay is unique (as far as I'm aware anyway.)[+] The art such as tower models, and characters are very nice, as well as the maps, effects, all of it. It's very sleek. [+] Maps and the randomness created by the mines moving around each game is awesome.[+] The audio (including character voices) is amusing and well-done.[+] User Interface is generally well-designed, and amusing, and looks good.[+] The camera is perfect.Issues:[-] User Interface and I have our disagreements. I want it to go back to a menu or let me restart right after I lose angrily and it just sits there and I hit buttons to try to make it go away, until it lets me exit the current map.[-] When exiting a map that you just lost (or won), there is small text that must be clicked, and I haven't found a key on the keyboard to make it click through. I would like to be able to hit [ESC] or [ENTER] and have it go back to the menu at that point.[-] I often find myself accidentally clicking and then it defaults to building a tower where I had no intention of putting a tower, and then I am sad.[-] From what I've played it doesn't seem there's a lot of genuine strategy. You just have to balance upgrading mines, units, and global unit stats, and keep everything moving in the right direction and build a standard set of towers with as long a maze as possible. If you build some towers in large quantities, you'll lose, if you focus on one type of upgrades, you'll lose.[-] UI doesn't agree with my pen tablet entirely. when I click to upgrade a tower it clicks constantly, and sometimes does odd things, which isn't that surprising.[-] Hotkeys for things are not displayed. If I could hover over the send button and it would say something like ""[SPACE] to Send Troops"" or ""[1] to queue this troop"". Those keyboard shortcuts are useful but I only learned them through the tutorial or tips or guesswork. I like hovering over things for information.[-] Hovering over units does not give any info about what unit they are or their health. I assume that's how they planned it, but I would very much like more information at my fingertips.[-] I find it hard to build a complex maze in a hex-grid (but that said, I'd still take a hex grid any day.)Other notes:[~] Gameplay is exceedingly challenging, getting me stuck on one bot for quite some time in single-player, and I can only imagine it's even harder against real people, as I'm sure I'll find out soon. It's a very delicate balancing act. The fact that it is hard is not a bad thing though. It's just not for people who aren't up for a serious challenge, or those with lots of skill already in other tower defense games.[~] Each game can be quite long, but I enjoy long games so I don't consider this bad.[~] Full disclosure: I bought it during the summer sale, for a very low price. I do think it's worth the asking price though, for sure.Conclusion:I love this game, despite it's flaws. I love it's style, I love hexagon-based games, and I love it's mechanics. If you're looking for a fun, straightforward tower defense game, I highly recommend it. This game requires patience, and a willingness to learn.			"

												Tower wars is a tower defense game where you also need to attack, you can play against random people via matchmaking or you can play against your friends or with them vs bots.If you're an achievement hunter don't try this game o.o one of them requires you to be #1 on the ranking of the season.The gameplay is very simple you start with a castle which you can upgrade armor and weapons in case enemy troops reach it , 3 gold mines which you need to hire workers and upgrade for better profit, barracks where you upgrade your troops armor hp speed etc and a lot of lanes to cover.The Good part of this game is you can see where the enemy is going to walk through so you can block stairs and paths in order to make them walk the longest while your lv 3 ballistas brutally murder them.There's 2 kinds of currency in the game , one is gold used to build troops, towers and upgrade them you get it passively via gold mines , the second is battle points which you get the longest your troops survive against the enemy towers used to get newer troops , upgrade them , and hire workers at your mines.The game is very slow but enjoyable but it falls apart end game , by the time one of the teams get the ""hero"" troop he can just send 5 of them at the same time and you can bet at least 1 or 2 of them is going to reach your castle unless you're like the god of strategy, really they're that strong.Fun game recommend buying it to play with a friend not that expensive			"

												Valve says they have anti cheats enabled on the players.  That's fine but who is stopping the compute from cheating?  this game is only meant for PVP and it shows just on level 4 bots.  The bots will start to hot key towers up while you have to hover your mouse for a few seconds.  Wouldn't be too bad if it wasn't a 10 to 3 rate on building.  And of course when you have to go find some mine or your castle to upgrade, the computer can build towers and upgrade everything at the same time.  However I just said this game was meant for PVP so not recommending it just because I'm more of a solo player isn't really fair.  While I haven't had a chance to try PVP with a friend the idea of you mapping out where you foe moves and what they get hit by as well as what goes to attack their castle is just heavenly for tower defense game lovers like myself.

												I am dissapointed in this game. While there are a plethora of options for the game, I find that I can't pull my camera back as far as I'd like. In addition the learning curve is fairly steep and unforgiving. This wouldn't be so bad except play is ONLINE ONLY. There's no skirmish mode against a computer, it seems like an obvious thing to add, but they didnt. You can only play this game against other players. So in my experience you either get absolutely trounced by people who have their strats down, or you trounce a new player. In addition since it's a newer game, you have to wait for a match to be made, yesterday that took eight minutes. 8 minutes of sitting in a queue staring at a loading screen isn't the most fun when I just want a 20-30 minute game.There is a single player 'TD' version of the game, but it's not the real game and feels tacked on.Ultimately I would say give this a pass just because of the online pvp only unless you're REALLY into this style of game.

It would be nice to have that to practice before you get involved in Ranked matches. Also, there's only 3 different maps at current.

												This game would be great, if only it didn't depend on other human players.  The mechanics of the game are rich and interesting.  However, the fact that the full range of features in this game is fully dependent upon multiple human players really ruins the experience for me.			"

												Interesting concept of a tower defence game but the dissapoinint part is that no one is playing online. No campaign, this game was made for PVP. I was able to set up a 1v1 with bots but the fun didn't last too long.The other and just personal issue with it is that the graphical interface icons are too small for me.			"

												Tower Wars is one of the best tower defenders I know.I would play it oftener, if more people would play it.So coop (2vs2 for example) is not possible. The 1vs1 online is hard to, you have to wait until 30 min if you are lucky.If you read this and trust me, call me. I would like to play this game more!Thanks for reading!			"

												This game is both awesome and difficult (bots and pvp). Long battles defending your castle and attacking the opposition in great swarms of waves. Demolition & destruction, the sheer agony of your enemy's troops as they fall in battle. Be wary to kill them fast though, or your time may well be spent best playing the TD mode which is also a great challange. Definite buy.  "

												Being a fan of Tower Defence maps in general. This game was easy to fall in love with.I've played Warcraft 3 tower defence maps for a long time. Aswell as countless others. Searching for a great tower defence game on steam I finally found Tower Wars.I immideatly fell in love with the game being a perfect TD game.Tower Wars is a tower defence game where you have to balance everything out.At the beginning of the game you make plans depending on the map you are playing on - What will my maze look like?You build fan towers slowing the minions down, making them take endless walks trough your well made maze looking to tear down your base.You have to balance everything out- chosing wether to invest in your goldmine or to send minions towards your enemy.You can have a lot of fun playing this game!I would reccomend it to anyone. Even my friends not being a regulare fan of tower defence			"

												If you can catch this game on sale, and are looking for a simple LAN game on a quiet night.. this can be a fun time. Like others have posted here, the online community is long gone, but I still play it with my wife co-op at home.Basically, you have to balance tower defense, income and sending your forces to their base. You don't get battle points without sending froces, and you need battle point to level mines. You need mines to build defenses. So you actually have to balance and not just turtle until she dies of old age. The graphics are Steampunkish, and nothing too heavy, so simple systems will handle this game. Hell it could probably run ona tablet these days. Download what few maps there are in the workshop, and get this on sale and you've got a good time-sink for you and your other. "

												While I enjoy playing the AI, and I dink around with this game alot... I completely suck at the on-line competitive component. I've got my moneys worth in the single player, but it does get old after a while. I wish there were a few more AI options for varying game-types, but as you can see with my playtime, what is here is worth the price of entry even if you only stay in single player mode.			"

												This is a very fun COOP game and very hard.The Singleplayer is to easy and boring.I still can't beat the 12th level in COOP. The art and sounds are AMAZING I love the settings.The gameplay is sometimes really intense and you need fast thinking to stop the blue things with top hats and robots from getting to your castle with rum in it.Good luck in getting to the last COOP level 12 and don't let the blue things with top hats get to your rum. :) and don't forget to set them on fire.

												Terrible mouse control, it moves the pointer around when you enter and exit radial menus.Visually it is very noisy and unclear what is happening on-screen (e.g. turrets vs creeps). These compund each other - it moves your mouse pointer, and then its hard to find again because it is so similar to other visual effects.Mechanically, its all a very standard tower defense. It does add sending waves of creeps at the other side, but doesn't do anytihng interesting with it.			"

												Edited: Pretty cool idea on the attack and defend concept. now that they have added the solo campaign to the game, it finally feels like a full game. Though the game is still harder than S**T, it is now more fun to play. Great job from the developers on this oneP.S. I do recomend them to have an easier difficuly for new players. You will most likely not suceed in this game or get good unless you put alot of time and alot of effort into it. Basicly you have to be dedicated to play. It would be differnt if the game started out just a little bit easier and then the game get s harder as you go.			"

												I got this game from the GMG (Green Man Gaming) Snack Pack 2 bundle. My brother recommended me it. At first, I wasn't convinced. Even though the bundle was 5 games for 50 cents, I could've gotten some more PAYDAY 2 DLC for my pennies. As it turns out, the bundle was well worth getting. Tower Wars has been the only game I have played in the bundle. (and you can even see my icon is a unit from Tower Wars, proof of how fun this is)Tower Wars is a classic Tower Defense type game mixed with offense. If you have played the game Toy Soldiers before, this game is like Toy Soldiers taken a step further.Now, more in depth about Tower Wars:ModesMeat vs. Metal (their classic offline, ""Player vs. Bot"" mode)        Objective: Destroy the enemy's castleClassic Tower Defense (also offline, and self explaintory)        Objective: Fend off as many waves as you canRanked Season Play (get paired with someone and play a match, tracked by leaderboards)        Objective: Destroy the enemy's castleUnranked Play (play in a public or private lobby, nothing is scored on leaderboards)        Objective: Destroy the enemy's castleCo-op (pretty much Tower Defense w/ a friend)        Objective: Fend off as many waves as you canTowersThere are multiple towers, each do something different, all of them gain an advantage over one type of HP (shield, armor, or health), and gain a somewhat disadvantage over the others (not as effective).UnitsThe units are pretty interesting, there are 6 tiers. First is the guy on the logo (Mr. Moopsy).Second you can choose from knights or speedy guys.Third tier includes a  unit that increases DPS and speed, another giving health to units within range when killed, and last a unit that gives your units shields/increases the amount of shields.Fourth tier you earn Stanley Cluckerbottom. He is a stong unit with lots of armor, health and shields.Fifth tier you unlock the best by far (in my opinion) unit. The (unofficial name) Trojan Horse. The horse can be filled with more units. when the horse is destroyed, the units disembark, then the horse explodes. This gives all 1-3 tier units a protective shell, giving them a chance to get to the castle. This unit is able to be upgraded the most in the game, allowing armor upgrades, more space upgrades, and also random unit upgrades.Sixth tier you unlock the guy on my icon; Malevolent. He has no shield, but high damage, max armor, and max health. Most of the time I can get him through or almost through the enemies defenses.UpgradesUpgrades are REALLY important.You can upgrade units, your barracks, or your castle.Unit upgrades: They advance/unlock your units.Mine upgrades are basic. All you can do is purchase more miners to increase income and upgrade your mine to purchase more.Barrack upgrades: These upgrades give all your units an upgrade, but cost lots.Castle upgrades are also basic. you can increase your armor and DPS (gatling guns fend off intruders). Like the mines, you can upgrade to a higher tier to increase the armor/DPSThe most basic of them all, tower upgrades: All you can do is upgrade them 3 times to increase the effectivity/range.Balancing (IMPORTANT)Gold: You earn it slowly. Purchase more miners to earn more per second. required to do anything in game besides upgrading your unit (NOT UNLOCKING, UPGRADING)Battle Points (BP): Required to purchase any form of upgrade besides tower upgrades. Earned by units over the ""TO BATTLE"" line.Cooldown: The timer before you can send another wave of troops.Barrack Queue: Amount of units you can send in a waveOVERALLIn a briefing, I would give this a 7/10.Good gameNot enough mapsNo easy modding/map support (tried to make a map myself, their tool crashed on me)			"

												Bro, get this game. It's only 7.99 on right now and I've got about 80 hours into it. Pretty  amazing considering I spent less than 10 dollars on it. This game is tower defense, but instead of a CPU sending the same sequence of units over and over, you defend against another person attacking you, and you must do the same! Lay down towers to maze your enemy anywhere but your castle and relentlessly send until you break their lines and take down their castle. You also have an economy, an individual unit tech tree, a general tech tree that applies to all units, and upgradeable towers of all different varieties. The learning curve is easy peasy but yet there is so much depth and subtly to the game. Super laid back but intense at the same time.			"

												Fun, although something seems to be missing from this otherwise great TD. Great for casuals, as you don't need to be a spreadsheeting min-maxer to enjoy this game, and the ten (iirc) AI opponents alone provide a challenge enough for most players, for at least a few hours of fun.			"
