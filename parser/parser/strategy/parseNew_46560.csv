												This is a great game! but be aware; you may have to do some tweaking to get it working.The game suffers from a terrible framerate bug on newer systems that makes it literally unplayable, however it can be fixed.My thoughts on the game itself are at the bottom.---Fix 1: Windows 7---If you are running windows 7 you may be able to fix the game via changing the font localisation files, instructions to do this are here: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2803612This won't fix the bugs on Windows 8 but it might be good to do anyway.---Fix 2: Windows 8 and Windows 7---If you're running windows 8 or if the above doesn't work then download a program called DXWnd found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/- After extracting the file run the 'dxwnd' .exe- A little blank window will open, select the 'edit' menu and click 'add'- A window with a bunch of options and tabs will open, fill them out as follows:- ""NAME:"" = Robin Hood (can be anything you like)- ""PATH:"" = C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Robin Hood\Game.exeNote: you may have the game installed at a different location eg. ""Program Files (x86)""That's it, Hit OK and you should see 'Robin Hood' appear as an option from the window that was blank before.- Select it and go >edit>run and the game will run smoothlyYou will have to launch the game using this program or have DXWnd open when launching it from steam every time.DXWnd is a hook program that you can use to get a lot of old games running smoothly on new systems, it won't hurt to replace the font files anyway if you still have some problems (in Fix 1). I didn't create DXWnd nor was I the one who worked out that it fixes the game. Sourceforge.net is a trustworthy site for developers and you can get more support from the guy who made the program there if you need it.This fix isn't perfect, I get grapical artifacts from the mouse on the menus and it's crashed once but otherwise it's run perfectly so far. Resolution looks a bit blurry, I'll add a way to fix that if I find a mod or work it out.---review---As for the game itself. This was one of my favourites as a kid! You have a small team of robin hood and his merry men that you move around like a traditional RTS, each unit you control has 3 or so abilities which are mostly unique. Robin can knock people out with a punch, frier tuck can tie people up with rope, little john can carry bodies etc. you'll have to combine these abilities to get through situations. You will want to avoid fighting, once a character is locked in combat it becomes dificult to escape and they'll slowly die, some characters can't fight at all; so the game is about stealth. Things happen slowly in this game, abilities are executed slowly, it's all a bit sluggish and clunky but that's not really a detriment. You'll be waiting for the ideal time to make your move and planning out your aproach. The sluggishness might feel lame for some people but it works fine for what you're trying to achieve. The levels are very well designed, they're open ended and have plenty of little areas that are a bonus. You'll clear one area and in doing so work out a solution for another area, these areas often wrap around and encircle each other. You can clear a level very quickly after you've figured things out but the first time around it may take hours. It's very satisfying.If you aren't a fan of stealth or clicky isometric games this isn't for you. It's about tactics and stealth, not combat.Their aren't many games in this genre and this game is up there with some of the best. Isometric stealth games are dead now but it's well worth the few dollars it goes for on steam to try them out with this one.props to thenikus for finding the fix for this game:http://steamcommunity.com/app/46560/discussions/0/35220315956625877/ "

												Amazing game! I first found this as a youngster and long regretted never completing it. I recently rediscovered it and within half an hour of playing I was COMPLETELY hooked once more. This game has truly stood the test of time with 3D isometric castles and forest settings that look gorgeous even by today's standards. The real magic, however, is in the gameplay. Fans of stealth games such as Splinter Cell and Assassin's Creed (not to mention the very similar Commandos) will especially enjoy the mechanics of Robin Hood. Citing Robin Hood's iconic chivalrous and humane nature, there is a very strong emphasis on using less-than-lethal force, with different character archetypes equipped with various skills to accomplish this. Isolated enemies can be subdued with a punch from behind; climb onto a rooftop and knock him out from range with a slingshot; or engage in combat and club him in the head. The AI is relatively basic but very effective. Bodies must be quickly carried out of view to avoid detection (eg. into the nearest house or guard tower), and bound with twine to prevent them raising the alarm and/or returning to their posts when they regain consciousness. If any team member is spotted, or a guard is noticed missing from his post, the enemy will initiate a search of the area and recover any downed comrades they find. A number of more tactical options provide myriad possibilities for dealing with large groups. Bee hives can be tossed into a crowd to allow Robin's men to quickly slip by in the ensuing confusion, whistles can be used to distract and mislead, purses of gold coins can be tossed in front of underpaid or unsupervised soldiers to prompt an entertaining fight, enticing ale can be dropped in an enemy's path causing them to become drunk and disoriented, agile men can skip around enemies by jumping across rooftops and climbing vines, or a net can be cast over a close group. More skilled enemies, such as knights and commanders, however, will be unconvinced by most of tactics and may even pull their understudies into line. Lethal force can be used when necessary. Stealth approaches can allow enemies to be strangled to death, or on many occasions detection will force a swordfight. Of course, it wouldn't be a Robin Hood game without archery, and this is indeed a very effective lethal takedown from a safe range (the enemy employs many archers as well, however, and will impressively use other soldiers to shield their own archers from incoming arrows). The relatively few main castle-based story missions are separated by a large number of targeted ambushes by Robin's crew in Sherwood Forest: the tax man, carts containing food, weapons and gold for the enemy war effort; small groups of passing soldiers; and messengers. The forest settings are not only beautiful but also filled with booby-traps the player can exploit to get the jump on unsuspecting enemy soldiers. I cannot emphasise enough how fantastic these are; the levels are jam-packed with hidden holes in the forest floor, piles of logs that can be pushed over, broad nets that can be triggered to capture anyone standing over them, and groups of friendly NPCs hiding amongst the trees waiting for Robin's signal. In between missions, a treehouse camp in Sherwood serves as base for the Merry Men. Here, idle NPCs can be instructed to create all of the consumables the player requires during missions (eg. arrows) or trained and sent off to assist in the war.The castle missions that drive the story forward are, at times, spectacular. The settings are gorgeous, the buildings are grand, and the level design is brilliant. Without spoiling anything, there are several missions later in the story where Robin must sneak around the castle to lower drawbridges, subdue generals and clear enemy archers to allow the rightful king's troops to invade the castle with minimal resistance. On that note, the story is basically about dethroning the king's brother who exploited an opportunity to have the true king kidnapped, thereafter resolving to drive the people into poverty and submission with extreme taxes and harsh discipline.On a final note, this is a game where the player is truly responsible for creating their own fun. With instant quicksaves and quickloads, it is convenient and appealing to replay the same confrontation many times over to achieve the perfect result. Just as one probably could plough through a mission in Splinter Cell in minutes with an assault rifle, it would be a great shame to so abruptly betray the point of the game: elegant success, rather than simply completing the objective. I found myself replaying some parts MANY times to complete it to my standard of stealth and perfection, or even to maintain the illusion of realism at times where I felt the AI had been a bit incompetent. The game allows up to three planned actions per character to be coordinated simultaneously, which complements the style of the game perfectly (eg. if able to sneak up behind two enemies, you can plan two characters to simultaneously subdue one soldier each, and simply press a button to execute the plan when ready). It was only towards the end that several of the intermediate missions become slightly tedious and repetitive, and it is great testament to the game that this is true. The maps and objectives differ little, in truth, but the gameplay is so fantastic that there are infinite ways to complete a mission, which is the core reason for the longevity of the entertainment on offer. This is a fantastic game in any era; it comes highly recommended by myself after thoroughly enjoying it- now one of my favourite games of all time.			"

												A classic stealth-strategy game definitely worth playing through once. It's quite dated and the Steam version is currently buggy on newer PC's, but this may only be the English version.  Some people have had luck patching their fonts files using http://www.gog.com/forum/robin_hood_legend_of_sherwood/the_game_running_slow/post25 or forcing DirectX 8 and/or windowed mode with DxWnd. The gameplay is quite challenging and the visual and audio are very well done.  Fighting uses unique gesture controls but the slow response time makes it tough to enjoy.  Of course the point is to avoid conflict, so if you're into a challenging stealth RTS give it a try.			"

												This game is great. It looks and plays beautifully. At least that's how I remember it. I bought it here on Steam and it is literally unplayable, completely broken. Lags a lot and flickers in a way you don't see anything on the screen. If you have an old pc get it but anything half-modern won't run it. Until they fix it DON'T, when they do this game is a must.EDIT: I managed to fix the problem by running the game on my laptop with Intel integrated graphics (2020M) instead of GeForce GT635m, works perfectly now. I never thought that feature would be useful but I'm grateful for it now. Seems the newer Nvidia drivers screw up the game (not sure, anybody who ran it on AMD?). If you have an older pc/laptop or one with this feature - give it a try. Still a thumbs down for selling (and putting on a sale) a game that's unplayable for many without giving a reason why or trying to fix it.			"

												This game... man this game... The first time I played this game was when I was like 10. For that era, it had the most beatiful graphics i`ve ever seen in any videogame.  The gameplay can be portrayed as a perfect combination of Age of Empires + Paint. Yeah, not kidding. You actually play the game as if it was AoE and when you get into a fight, you draw♥♥♥♥♥♥with your mouse to attack. If you draw an inverted & you make an attack that takes time but is sure to ♥♥♥♥ up the enemy, but it also takes all your stamina, leaving you defenseless for like 3 seconds.  You need to think what to do here. Unless you play on easy, you won`t regenerate HP and there is permadeath for your companions. The story-related companions cannot die as long as you have lucky grass, as I call it. But once you are out of those, it`s game over for ya.  Apparently the game has a problem with newer OS but with a simple download of a file from GoG it gets fixed, so it`s cool if you want to play this jewel.  If you want an even more great experience, play this game in Spanish (latinoamerican people only unless you fully understand the language). This is not a joke, the game must be the only one that plays flawlessly in spanish, since the dub is god-like and fits the game and era perfectly like never before.			"

												After all those years and still so fun to play. The last time I played this I was 10 years old, I didn't have a lot of money so I played a pirated copy of this. Now that I can afford it I thought I'd just get it legitimately. But one thing led to another and here I am playing it again, rejoicing every moment with memories.This game was where I learnt a lot of English (Eng is my second language). I can still remember that I got stuck for mroe than an hour at the first Friar Tuck encounter because I didn't know what a ""vestry"" was. Had to play the game with a dictionary by my side.If somebody could go and make a HD remake of this, I would be so happy. 10/10 would buy againAnyway, this won't run properly on Windows 8. I used the free version of VMWare - VMware Player to install a virtual XP machine to play in. Note: u'd need to ""acquire"" an XP iso to install the virtual machine. There is flickering but switching graphics - resolution to 800x600 and back to 1024x768 fixes it for a single mission. If this was a modern game, it'll be unacceptable but this came out in 2002 so I don't mind a bit hassle.			"

												Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood is an isometric strategy game in the vein of the Commandos and Desperadoes series. You control Robin Hood and his Merry Men as you undertake a variety of missions in various locales in an attempt to ransom King Richard and thwart the evil machinations of the Sherrif of Nottingham and Prince John. Your standard Robin Hood tale, if you will. The game features beautiful isometric graphics that still hold up to this day, the voice acting is pleasantly passable and the levels are well designed. You control your characters by clicking and dragging and fight your enemies by pressing down your mouse and dragging it around. It sounds a bit gimmicky but it's actually very satisfying to see your character twirl when you draw a circle. It also works surprisingly well. As other reviews have mentioned if you play the version steam gives you, it will lag terribly. This is because it uses the wrong font for the text in the game. If you download and replace the font, the game will run like butter. This game is highly enjoyable and is worth giving a shot if you're browsing steam or your library looking for something to play.

												This game doesn’t match up very well with ""Desperados"" or the ""Commandos"" games, and it's just flat and unimaginative. It is an okay game, which I enjoyed playing when it first came out, but those other two titles were way better. And if you have played them, then you will most likely agree.

												- 100% Completion means stealth the game without killing anyone - Little John campaign mission starts with dead soldiers on the ground that ruin your 100% score10/10-------------------------------------------------------Since probably not a lot of people add actual reviews just dish on the terrible steam port, I really ought to write a sincere review of it.TL;DR: Steam Port sucks, but can be fixed easily. Very old top-down strategic game with a lot of very neat stealth mechanics coupled with thrilling and difficult combat neither being the obligatory route. Given a stealth game its not very repetitive - your mistakes and playstyle can make it unique. Graphics are not realistic by any means, but fairly easy on the eye for its time given it uses static imagery backgrounds as the full environment.So, lets get the cons out of the way immedieatly. The Steam Port is pretty terrible, due to a couple of valid reasonings. First of all, its barely even worthy of that label, given there aren't any achievements (that's understandable though), there isn't a working steam overlay and streaming it is fairly impossible. But those things you can get away with it being a single player game. Two other major issues arise though. Some players might experience flickering imagery, mainly intros and the menu. These can be fixed by having the game run with your integrated graphics card, instead of an NVidia one. Another big issue is people having quite low FPS, which can be fixed by downloading certain files, in my case I found german fonts' files (totally the same as the original) to replace in-game fonts. Surfing around the net should find you some fixes. Its still worth noting though, don't buy it if you're totally not willing to look around for potentially malitious files around the internet.Gameplay-wise the negative attributes of this game are fairly scarce. You have to keep in consideration that this is a game easily older than 10 years old. That brings with itself repetitive speech lines, mediocre game length and limited obstacles. Even design wise there are a lot of balance flaws. A lot of abilities are simply never used, often because the player's playstyle, let it be fully stealthing things, being the aggressor and killing everyone or even a solid mixture of both, demands the use of a very little pool of skills/characters (E.G. When stealthing I've never used Will Scarlets choke or any archer's bow for anything but sherwood traps). Some abilities on the other hand are just simply rubbish, being hard and hardly rewarding, like Stuteley's net and apples and beggar imitation - basically, Stuteley sucks.And while I do want to list it as a pro, you can easily be underwhelmed by the visuals, given you simply don't find old games appealing, which is totally fine. In that case, you might not like the visuals of this game given its obvious age limitations. I don't think you'll find a single game though from this era that'll suit your desires in that case.Last but definitely not least - the price. I bought it for a euro and wouldn't spend a lot more. Mainly because I'm a student but also because a price above 5 euros is way more than the game deserves. The causes for it are obvious and were already mentioned: a brand new indie game with the same price could probably entertain you a lot more, albite Robin Hood being surprisingly unique; and the Steam Port has the aforementioned issues, causing troublesome discomfort.And finally, I'll list the reasons I simply love this game and consider it in one of my top 10 all time favorites.First, nostalgia. I have to get this out of the way. This is one of my childhood games, a big reasoning of me liking it. Thus this review might definitely seem a bit bias. If this was one of your childhood games too though, there's very few reasons for you to not buy it, especially when its on a sale.Next up, lets bring up the visuals once more. For its time, it did a lot with very little regarding graphics. Being an isometric game, Robin Hood has very minimal mobile images. Almost anything that isn't a character, is static. This makes the game quite beautiful, as you're basically playing on a painting, with some manipulation to it. The imagery though is definitely not dull, as there are minor - but plentiful - details like puddles and animals that please the brain and the eye alike.Production wise there aren't a lot of bugs to find. I've found only one thus far, definitely having above a houndred hours if counting in childhood gameplay.The gameplay is a bit of a conundrum. I love it to be honest: the game is both mediocre in length and somewhat repetitive. With the two cancelling each other out. What do I mean? There are around 15 campaign missions to go through, and while the story is entirely different for each, there are mainly only 5 areas you visit during campaign missions. The settings are mixed up every time, but given the format of - people guarding something/someone/a route - knock them out or kill them - do objectives, a format a lot of stealth games follow, you might find the game repetitive. E.G. ""Ughhh, I have to somehow punch through another group of 10 soldiers"" or ""Oh damn it another mounted knight, how am I going to do this AGAIN"". But this is simply the product of having no filler cutscenes and background narration, not the actual gameplay being troubled. You can't say racing games aren't repetitive and start acusing Robin Hood. There does come massive variety from your playstyle though, as you're definitely given a relatively huge canvas to work with, e.g. disabling guards with easily above 8 abilities. So about the two traits cancelling each other out: if you still find the missions awfully repetitive, with you simply not coping with the struggle, the grind, of getting through each obstacle, you'll probably just take a brake after a mission or two, prolonging the theoretical gametime, or at least, making the gametime feel longer. Given how unique, and up-to-you this stealth strategy is, you will definitely urge to play it after a short hiatus. I guarantee it.The storyline is actually great! Being a game about the overused english myth Robin Hood, it has got nothing to do with the fairy tale /steal from the rich, give to the poor!/ cliche'. In fact, the game covers a lot of historical elements from Robin's point of view, mainly based around King Richard the Lion Heart's capture during the Crusades, and the Sherwood of Nothingham and Prince John abusing their position to the utmost fullest, trying to get rid of both you and the king. You as a man stripped from his heritage and wealth gather up a group of old friends and struck down folk to overthrow the tyrants.Lastly, the difficulty. The game is certainly in a sweet spot regarding this topic. Playing in the easy setting is definitley fairly casual, as the only obstacles you'll face are your own desires of doing missions with a higher score. Highest difficulties will make combat and stealth harder, and will make collectible side missions a devastating affair. In addition, as most stealth games, you can save at any point in time, allowing you to fix errors a.s.a.p.To finsih this waaaay too long review, I'd like to say I definitely recommend it, especially if you don't care about the small array of cons listen. Mainly getting around the steam port visual bugs is a must, but its definitely not a big obstacle given how even I got around it real fast. If you've played it before you'll yearn for it again, if not you'll experience a very fun, unique and enjoyable stealth-based strategy game guaranteed if you like the genre.			"

												There has been but one game in my entire collection that has kept me playing for years on end, on all difficulty modes, exploring all options, and all play styles.  That game is Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood, truly the most unique blend of RTS and stealth that I have ever seen.Robin Hood's charm lies in a fantastic blend of aesthetic beauty, simple yet deep and immersive gameplay, and a carefully crafted formula of story and interaction that really pushes the player to complete more of the game.  This game is also one of the only games whose Hard and Normal difficulty offer tangible, entertainment benefits towards completion.  The mechanics of the game work so well, I was actually compelled to play higher difficulties and test my abilities.  This game is timeless in its core gameplay and presentation.  Anyone who misses out on getting this game is missing a masterpiece.10/10 would Merry Man again			"

												Why isn't Steam banning this? That's a rip-off!I mean, I love that game and played it often in my childhood, but it can't be that you pay for a game that is not running. If they release such a old game on Steam that late, then they should at least make sure it's running on current systems. It's surely not impossible to fix this game and maybe tweak it for higher resolutions.Really, I'm disappointed Steam is supporting that rip-off. Not that anybody on behalf of the developers care that players pay for a game that is not running unless you've got < Windows XP - which is most likely not the case for anybody owning Steam.I can't recommend this - no fix, no recommendation.

												Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood is one of the greatest games of all times. It's a classic and I suggest you to play it at once if you haven't played it already. This game is a masterpiece in every aspect. The second best successor of the legendary Commandos series. The first one, Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive was also produced by Spellbound. The only thing that troubled me about Robin Hood was there were many unnecessary forest levels to increase the length of the game. It doesn't bother you a lot at your first playthrough. If you want to get the most out of this game, try to play the missions without killing the guards.9/10			"

												This game is great once you have fixed all the bugs which can take a while. These are things which make the game terrible. (cons)With the game 13 years old the graphics are not good when zoomed in fully or in fact zoomed out fully.  The difficulty levels are okay but still bad. What I mean is that on easy it takes one swipe of the mouse to kill 15 guards at once this is stupid. However, on medium difficulty you have the same amount of health and you cannot regenerate health but the enemy have 40 more hit-points and do 1.5 times as much damage to you. This makes the late game incredible hard. I haven't tried the game on hard difficulty yet.The settings of the game are very minimalistic.However, what makes the game good (pros)The price of the game is dirt cheap on sales now.Takes a little amount of memory.Can run on any system with modding the game slightly.If you have played this game before like me the game brings a lot of nostalgia which is good.There aren't that many strategy games which have the same feel as this game gives off.In conclusion, I would recommend this game to those who have played this game before and are willing to do research on getting the game working on modern systems. However, if you are new to this game the effort in fixing the game may not be worth it to play the game for 10-20 hours (on easy difficulty).For those who like numbers at the end of a review I would give the game 7.5/10.

												I used to have this game on cd-rom, but it broke unfortunately. So I chirped happily when I saw it on steam.This is a very good game, and lots of fun to play. an unique fight style that reminds you of Commando's and is horribly neglected. You might want to tweak it's compatability though, it's and old game and probably runs less on newer computers. "

												Don't buy this game.Now let me tell you why.I love this game. Played it many years ago, loved every minute of it. But the version of it on Steam is BROKEN. And even if you somehow manage to get it to work, it is slow and buggy and lags. It just isn't even worth it. Go to another website, or platform or something and get it there or just pick it up on eBay. Don't buy it here, it WILL NOT WORK.			"

												Long ago, I played the demo of this game when I was a child. It was one of my favourite games ever!Now, I get the full game and I can tell that this is a very good and enjoyable game to this day!How can this game tagged as a mixed one on Steam??? I check the majority of the negative reviews and most of them are just complaining about how this game is lagging/doesn't work on their operation system at all. I feel that this is not fair at all, people are going to miss an awesome game. D: It's just a very old game so it needs an optimization! Still, it's up to you to buy it or not! Get it cheaper: I bought mine for 2 tf2 keys! I hope they will do something against this lagging stuff too.For me it's running good, no lags or anything bad!Anyway, back to the game:I really like the atmosphere of this game, the map/model makers did a good job on it. The castles, the forest and the towns are idyllic and beautiful!Sounds and music are also golden in this game! The song of the Sherwood is one of my favourite songs.The characters are well made, everyone has useful abilities, my favourites are Will Scarlet (although, he has a very agressive playstyle, he got a slingshot which can take out people without killing them) and Little John (he is definitely not little but I like how he wakes up his fainted teammates and generally he is good against big crowd)For now, let me tell you what is the bad thing in this game (because nothing is perfect!):Just one: The zooming... just why did they add that? :V It's very pixelated when I zoom in and when I zoom out it's too small for me. Maybe the zoom out is useful.To end this, let me share some tips to this game if you are a starter in this game:-Pick up every scrolls and give money to the beggars! A scrolls can tell you many useful information like: characters' abilities, warnings and they can reveal soldiers who are  in ""shadows"". What's more you can spawn more scrolls by giving money to the beggars! You can add more money to him for more informations but it's  a waste of money if you give money to the beggars then he says: ""Oh sugar!"" or something. If he says that, don't give him more money because he will not give any information to you!-Try to not kill so many soldiers if you can! A lot of Merry Men are going to join to you after every missions,if you don't kill many people! Those guys are very useful in the Sherwood Forest: they can make arrows, herbs which are actually ""health packs"" in this game. I don't prefer them in combats untill they are more skilled in fighting but you can still bring them to the missions as extra teammates!-Know the characters' abilities, how they can fight and train them in the Sherwood Forest in you leave them there if you go to the mission (or just leave them to make arrows or something, it's up to you)!-Collect the clovers! If your characters die, you can use these to bring them back! If you complete some tasks to the poor citizens they will give you these clovers! That's all! Have fun with this game! :D			"

												Robin Hood is a great game, but it has some lag issues on windows 8 or later.To fix that you have to download a program called ""dxwnd"" for the specific version of the game, or simply search for ""Robin Hood lag fix Windows 10. The video which helped me is on youtube:  /watch?v=5wCDuPpdFOAEverything works fine, but while in menu, the cursor is a little bit buggy. But it has no effect on gameplay and can be ignored.The developers made great efforts to make this game very detailed and atmospheric. The painted backgrounds are lovely and figure animation is good though the game is from 2002.There are so many ways to mess around with the guards but it remains really challenging. Especially the ""no-kill-challenge""			"

Another Commandos like game jewelIf you played and liked Commandos, you will love this game. It is just the same, but situated to the Robin hood story. There are many characters you can lvl up and choose to your party to exactly fit the mission's needs. PLUS, since there is not much of shooting like in commandos, but mostly close combat, they added new element - when you drag your mouse around the character and he makes appropriate move and combats so gain another dimension of gameplay and fun. GOOD things:  Another Commandos game, but not so hardcore Funny characters' dialog lines OLD game - you dont need powerfull hardware BAD things:  OLD game - kinda outdated graphics for 22""+ monitors, but still VERY nice "

												I was slightly worried when I bought this game because of all the reviews stating it has trouble running on modern PCs. I took a chance though, and I'm glad I did.I do most of my gaming on my custom build (GTX 760, FX-8320, Windows 7), and although I was worried this game might have compatibility issues on that PC, I had a backup plan in that I also have an old Dell laptop with Windows Vista on it that I thought could definitely run the game if my main gaming PC couldn't. After instaling the game first on my main machine and experiencing some extremely low FPS (especially during combat), I tried it on my laptop, where it ran perfectly. I'm so glad bacause this is really a fantastic game. Beautiful graphics of the isometric style (every environment/map looks incredibly detailed and good enough to frame as a painting on your wall), interesting gameplay (RTS style focussing soley on combat and stealth), and a story with a great narrative, voice acting and music that completely immerse you into the adventure. This game captures the essence of Robin Hood perfectly.The bottom line is that this game is great and can probably run perfectly if you have an older computer/operating system. Even on a newer PC, it was still somewhat playable, but only if you reeeeeeeeally want to play the game and would tolerate such issues. Hopefully this game will eventually get an HD re-release like what Age of Empires II and other older games are getting, or at least some kind of update/patch to get it to work on modern machines.

												One of my favourite childhood games has come back to life and is once again capable of being played on a modern OS. This game has the distinct mark of being fun for so many types of gamers. It has a great story that can be thoroughly enjoyed with ease on easy modes, but the has a deep levele of strategy on harder difficulties. It has enough of an RPG element to be enjoyable (skill increases, permanent death of companions, injuries that can be difficult to heal) but you never feel the need to grind or repeat side missions for the purpose of furtherer your character. Most missions are a mixture of stealth and carefully chosen combat, but other missions can bring the thrill of a full out assault on a fortress.I obviously have the bias of enjoying this game as a kid, but it is a beatiful game that has stood the test of time (and whose graphics are much prettier than the trailer seems to indicate).

												This game was a childhood favorite, though I lost the CD, and I had just enough in my steam wallet to purchase it on sale. I was really looking forward to savoring this classic and seeing if it lived up to my memories of it (and maybe to actually completing it, since I never did as a child). However, all the menus, from the main menu to the in-game story scrolls have a mirage-like, oscillating blur effect obscuring the legibility of any of the text after a split second of legibility when it initially loads, except for the highlightable buttons once they're highlighted. I'm on Windows 7-64 bit with a Radeon 7950 an intel iCore5-3470 CPU @ 3.20 Ghz (4 CPUS) ~ 3.6 Ghz, and 4 Gigs of RAM. Has anyone found a solution to this bug or has anyone else at least encountered it? I can't recommend this game until this bug is fixed, though if it is fixed I will most likely give this game a thumbs up if my memory serves me right.EDIT: I fixed the problem by turning off Morphological Filtering in the Catalyst Control Center. The game certainly lives up to my recollection of its enjoyability, especially for a little over $1. Beautiful, art direction, soothing music (except for the combat music, which is passable), fun characters, unique gameplay (closest comparison to gameplay-style I can remember right now is the Commandos series and this has a much more detailed and directed storyline with a rich cast of colorful characters on both sides of the unfolding conflict as the story progresses), a surprising amount of variation in the mission-types as the game progresses, and even a fair amount of unique, temporarily available side missions during the campaign and secondary objectives during quests that are part of the main story.The game can be frustrating at times. Orders must be given carefully and in the heat and confusion of combat this can often be a tall order to complete. My main complaint is that characters insist on pulling the arrows they've just been shot with out as soon as they get shot and nothing will stop them from doing so. This animation often causes an unstoppable loop that will cause your character to be shot repeatedly by the same archer while taking just long enough to pull out each arrow for him to be shot again with another arrow that he will take the same amount of time pulling out, giving the archer just enough time to nock yet another arrow. I'm not sure that immediately ripping an arrow out of the wound as soon as one is shot would really be the smartest or most common reaction of anyone, but the rest of the game makes up for this glaring and common flaw in the game design. My tactics have become very focused on taking out archers quickly.			"

												Ah, one of my favourite games from my childhood, but there's an issue with fonts that cause fps drops and other nasty things. All you have to do, is to search for fonts from other language version of this game (or type ""fonts fix"" in google) and switch them with those being on your disk. That's it. After fixing that, you can see that is a fun game, somewhat containing stealth and tactical elements. Although, it's not that much challenging that it sounds.			"

												Explanation of this review: the installation options allow for different languages for the game, and each version gives replayability.English version: Great game! Set in the great land of England, and what I consider to be the canonical version of the Robin Hood story. No such thing? There is NOW! Original legend's one thing, but as far as a story goes, this is the best, I think. The gameplay is deep enough, and so is the story. Amusing, too!German version: Great game! Set in... someplace, I guess. I'm still trying to figure that out myself. Since German makes everything sound so epic, expect adrenaline rushes. Any Nazi jokes and I'll stick your fingers in a meat grinder.Spanish version: Great game! Set in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly humorous land of Spangland, the hero Robin Hood with his friend the Sneaky Stutely, this adventure is packed with humour! Spanish is always funny. I'm almost constantly laughing when I play.Overall: Since translation does not affect the story, the story is top notch in each iteration. Surprisingly, the voice acting is fantastic in ALL three of these versions (and hilarious in Spanish), the difficulty settings are also great. Easy is too easy, perfectly imbalanced for the kiddies. Normal is normal for once, and good for the average player. Hard is too difficult for most people, but good for pros, and nicely realistic in that BLACK ARCHERS SHOOT YOU FOURTEEN TIMES WITHIN HALF A SECOND if you let them. Perfect realism, these are elite troops after allHowever, immersion broken with the RED CAVALRY. THEY SLIDE VIOLENTLY AT OBTUSE SIDEWAYS ANGLES AND SOMETIMES MOONWALK AT YOU WITH A FLAIL, OBLITERATING YOU AT JET SPEEDS WITHIN A FRACTION OF A SECOND AND BAT YOU A HOME RUNNot a problem for those with plot armour, but will be a serious problem for your Redshirt Merrymen if you're not careful. Fortunately, cavalrymen can't moonwalk through solid objects, so just step behind a tree if you don't want these fools running you down at solar wind speeds.11/10, would shoot Parker and let his ghost summon reinforcements in the Lincoln siege again			"

												There are problems. The gameplay itself, as I remember it, is fine. I remember playing this years ago on my old PC. It's quite fun, and has a lot of varied gameplay that can really make you play for hours. The problem is the performance of the game on newer systems. Off the bat, the game only supports up to 1024x768, and it's currently impossible to fix. Windowed mode is impossible by default. The worst thing is the performance. Running on a quad-core i5, 4 GB of RAM and a heavily overclocked HD 7850 2GB on a 1080p monitor, the game is a slow sluggish mess that's literally unplayable unless you want to spend six hours completing one level.I recommend steering well clear from it until a patch of some sort is out, if it ever is.

Ironically it is a REALLY good game.  It reminds me a lot of games like Baldurs Gate, commando, and it's ilk for the game play aspect.  The story and mechanics of the game are actually pretty well done also and the game is rather fun to play.  All in all well worth the purchase price even if it seems a bit dated by todays standards.  Pick this one up, but on the cheap.			"

												I recently picked this game up on a steam sale for dirt cheap and it holds up as well today as it did then. If you have played Commandoes before this game is very similar if not a bit more accessible. Robin Hood Legend of Sherwood presents an incredible level of freedom in how you choose to approach a given mission. Its controlled with simple point and click and you draw lines or circles to control your character's attacks. Its very simple and intuitive. It presents different characters that you can use to help accomplish your objectives each with their own skill set. Friar tuck can throw bee hives or put down flasks to get guards drunk. Little John can tie enemy soldiers up that have been knocked out and carry them to hide them. Robin Hood as you might expect has a bow that can activate traps, etc. He also can throw coins at the more simple minded guards to get them to fight with one another. Each map is incredibly detailed with the later ones that take place in castles being incredibly vast. It needs to be stated that this game is 10 years old. I encountered sever slowdown/lag when trying to run this game on Windows 8.1. I believe this may be due to fonts or a matter of newer multicore systems. I still give this game a cautious recommendation if you can find it for cheap and are willing to do a bit of tweaking to get the game to run well. There is a useful guide found here...https://www.gog.com/forum/robin_hood_legend_of_sherwood/the_game_running_slowThis will allow the game to run but I have been having some flickering and odd mouse ghosting. So just bear in mind this is an older game and may need some TLC to get it running properly.			"

												A caution to Windows 8.1 users - this game is poorly optimized for newer OS, and has so far been incompatible. Like BorderZone (the only other game I have been unable to give a fair review due to unplayability), I have tried the fixes discussed in the forums, (unfortunatly) to no avail. I will keep an eye out for other fixes, as I was really looking forward to trying this game.When I run it, the extreme lag makes it seriously not worth the attempt. From what I experienced, however, the music is really good, and the art style is nice. The game seems to have a deeper RPG/strategy mechanic, and has been likened to the solid Desperados series - which I really enjoyed.A shame, I was really excited to play this.			"

												Probably one of the most underrated RTS games last year was Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive.  It had a huge amount of challenge and it did justice to the Wild West setting with some slick graphics and sound.  Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood (LoS) does the same thing for the Sherwood Forest while sticking closely to the conventions of Desperados, which is a good thing and a bad thing.First the good, getting a handle on the controls will be a snap for players of Deperados, as LoS handles and plays alike – controlling a group, distracting enemies, an emphasis on stealth, etc. – except for one key area.  Obviously, the world of Robin Hood is populated with swords and arrows, and not with six-shooters and sniper rifles.  This means a complete change in tactics since Robin Hood and his band of happy-go-lucky guys, can’t plug an armored knight from across the map.  Hell, an arrow won’t even drop the knight; you have to get up close and personal with your sword. "

												The game don't run on Windows 10 and only has a max resulotion of 1024x768! The publisher ""Microids"" do nothing and only earn money for greate games like this. At the moment we can only play with a stretched viev and a unstable ""community-fix"".With the sourcecode it would be very simple to make a greater or dynamic resolution by editing the vievpoint and cutting the UI.

The beautiful pre-rendered scenarios, the difficulty of some levels, the option of going all out or stealthily knocking out the guards until everyone's tied up in some random house... I play this game every mfin year and I'm glad I finally own it. I guess an upside down is that you HAVE to kill the mounted ♥♥♥♥nights if you want to have some liberty of action.

												Just a quick disclosure first: The game had some serious performance/lag issues on my PC. No idea what was up, but it felt like it was running at 15fps. Also had some bizarre flashing/blinking issue. Now onto the game! The game is a top down action/strategy game that plays like a stealth version Diablo or similar. You have objectives that usually involve reaching a certain area of the map that is patrolled by a number of guards or soldiers. In a 1-on-1, Robin Hood can hold his own vs. most enemies, but can quickly be outnumbered. The idea is to either knock out unsuspecting enemies, or use the environment to your advantage. The issues I had with the game are that I couldn't tell which objects I could interact with, and which would just move me right to a non-interactive decal. As well, I couldn't figure out how to heal myself; even between levels, damage would carry forward. I figure there is some way to do it, but if I have to look outside of the game to figure out the basics of the game, then I consider that a failing of the game. In closing, the game shows a lot of good ideas but has not aged well. Stealth and swordplay have been done much better in more recent games, and the game does not perform well on newer machines. Worth a try if you have it, but I wouldn't recommend to buy it otherwise.			"

												This game feels and looks...off. Like it was designed by a European developer and intended for an entirely different platform. There's some fun to be had, and it pays loving, much-appreciated homage to the Robin Hood legends; but compared to other isometric fun-fests like ""Diablo"", ""Diablo II"", ""Fallout"", ""Fallout II"", ""Baldur's Gate"", ""Baldur's Gate II""...well, it just feels too fussy and unpolished. It almost feels like a Beta, or an attempted update of a simpler game from the early 1990s. I can't say it's bad, but I also can't recommend it. Give it a shot and see how YOU feel.			"

												Unlike most people, this game actually worked for me, but that let me realize it wasn't any fun or good. Apparently you will blow this game if you played commandos or desperados, neither of which I played, so I didn't really care. The graphics can't go higher than 800 x 600 (there was 1024 by 700 but it makes the screen so small not worth it). This leaves the screen a jumbled blocky pixelated mess. There is no tutorial to explain any of the controls or game mechanics. You hae these tiny scrolls that you pick up that explain bits and pieces.....why not just explain them in the game, why give me a tedious task of walking around the map getting them. There is no direction to the map. I had an X and a black dotted line but it was pointing back to the start of the level. So basically you just wander around hoping to find what you need. Apparently you can't fight most people, which I found from reading online, but the game doesn't tell you. Why would Robin Hood not be able to fight people?! But the stealth mechanics are so meh anyways. You can crouch and walk, but its too slow to do anything. You can only see 1 person's cone of vision at a time, which many people has pointed out is dumb.  I got seen from someone super far away and on a different level, made no sense. Also I went to knock out a guy from behind and suddently he was alerted, once again made no sense. Also sometimes just by walking I got heard and found out by a guy that was turned around, but then other times I wouldn't, more inconsistencies. The combat is actually pretty fun for this type of game, with using your mouse to make different swipes. Some other things don't add up though. I walked in this room with this guy, but I couldn't interact with him or attack or knock him out, but seeing me he ran and alerted a bunch of people in the castle and they knew exactly where to find me......why have a guy I can't do anything about but that affects me? The level design is also poor. The first level you're in this big castle and there is no evident way to get around. There are multiple levels and doors you can't tell you can interact with, it makes it super confusing to get around. You basically just click somewhere far away and hope he finds his way there. But this leads to the other problem, you can't see inside rooms. I would be outside a room and once I opened the door or robin went inside I could see it, but by then it was too late because the people inside spotted me.......dumb. Also unfortunately the 2d doesn't work as a lot of time you feel the need to rotate the camera. I guess the game also has a resource management where you assign people benign tasks at your home base like chopping wood.......boring. All-in-all I would say get this game if you like 15 year old pixelated commando games with poor resolution. Other than that there isn't much here. 4.5/10.			"

												I give this game a bad rating because most computers come equipped with Windows 8.1 now and Windows 8.1 is so poorly optimized (or it's just the game itself, I don't know) but this game lag is literally unbearable, it's so bad that you can't even walk.			"

												Game does not work on a normal modern PC with Windows 7. It's laggy and unplayable. Do not buy it. They should take this game out of the store or patch. Everything else is actually fraud.			"

												.1-5I got this game to work on my computer after about 2 hours of gameplay.  On the third mission, my computer froze.  IT CORRUPTED EVERYTHING ON MY COMPUTER!! I lost 2 years of everything.  It corrupted my external hard drive as well.  Get this game at your own peril.  I was excited to play a childhood game of mine, but not worth.			"

In a NutshellThis game is an engaging blend of real-time tactical stealth action with minor base-building and RPG elements.GameplayYou play Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men in a game that plays much like Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines. Most of the gameplay involves completing missions with a small team of one to five units under your command. You can issue separate instructions to the members of your team, who will attempt to complete them in real time. Against you are the strong and numerous forces of the Sheriff of Nottingham and King John. Even though you are vastly outnumbered, you have a number of tricks up your sleeve -- disguises, lures, traps, bows and arrows, and even a catapult (that's British for ""slingshot"" in case you're American). You'll need them all if you are to survive.Along the way, you'll have plenty of opportunities to ""liberate"" the gold from your enemy's coffers. Robin Hood steals from the rich and gives to the poor, and his band of Merry Men are very poor indeed. You'll need that gold to improve your forest base between missions. Here, you'll get to train your men and make equipment such as arrows, leather pouches, and medicine for healing wounds. You won't have many options when it comes to base building. You'll want to build up all your facilities when you can.My EvaluationI love playing stealth games, and I love tactical games, so Robin Hood: Legend of Sherwood is right up my alley. The 2D graphics are dated by today's standards, but they are still nice to look at. There is hardly any replay value once you complete the game, but playing it through once is enough to appreciate the fine experience.			"

												I`m just gonna start off with the issues here because when i remembered it and bought it, i was pretty much searching for the refund button after 4-5 minutes of gametime.the thing is this awesome game was released in 2002, and today almost any pc gamer has windows 7 or windws 8 (32/ 64 doesn`t matter), therefore it`s platform, built on old directx, manifests problems . It is close to imposible to play after you hit that new game button, and also the english version has font issues. But have no fear! If you really like a game, on pc you can make it work if you try hard. The solution might be a bit complex for someone who does not have experiece, but nonetheless it is a working and tested solution by myself and others and it takes 5 minutes to run the game.It can be found on the forum, somebody else posted it and documented it.For classic game I`d say this goes over 9/10 because the fight mechanic is a bit buggy i.e. after an opponent is knocked out your character stays idle and you have to manually select him and put him in combat if you don`t want him to actually get damage and die... also some other overall minor issues.In short :- doesn`t work at start-you need to install Dxwnd and run it as admin everytime-fix fonts -it`s done! you have a great classic game			"

												Amazing game, even the graphics are decent for a game this old. Only problem is, does not work very good on Windows 8. And, you have to do something to get it to work normally on Windows 7. If you check the game hub, you will see a post about it lagging (low FPS), and how to fix it.			"

												Really nice game! And of course very nostalgic.I love the intro, it is very cool and well made. Well of course you can not build a great game only on a good intro but this intro adds a lot to the game experience. However the story is very good the game is generally well made.If I should complain about something it is that the name text for the characters is very small and not in the font from the original game. I am running it on Windows XP. One more thing is that it is a bit too easy to get Merry Men. The Sherwood forrest is crawling with them long before you have finished the game which results in that you get a lot more resources than necessary.Anyway, definitely worth 7.99 euro!			"
