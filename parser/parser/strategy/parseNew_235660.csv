												Very difficult TBS game, even on Beginner. Can be very frustrating till you learn the systems but people willing to plow through and figure it out will be rewarded with a very fun (and cheap) time sink. Despite losing my first two campaign attempts I stuck with it, got an idea for what was going on and suddenly lost 40 hours of the first week. Highly recommended for TBS fans and people who enjoy a challenge.			"

												Alright, what's the deal with this game? It's got crappy graphics and looks like it's from 1998!Let's ignore those facts for a moment. Suspend your disbelief, if you will. What's going on beneath the surface with the game mechanics?As of this review writing, I've got 305 hours spent on this game (I'm a bit ashamed of that). So, there's something being done right here. It certainly scratches a lot of my itches and gives me what I'm looking for.In terms of strategy, there are multiple layers of complexity. You're first introduced to the game in a small starting scenario which introduces the game mechanics to you. Most of the time, you are moving your hero armies around on the campaign map. On occassion, your hero will get into a tactical battle against monsters or other heros. This takes place on a hexagonal grid system and each side takes turns moving all of their creatures.The battles are quite tactical. Your creatures come in 4 different tiers of strength. Each unit comes with certain strengths and weaknesses, and abilities. For example, the thief has a dagger strike which poisons his foes and doesn't let them counter attack. However, the thief doesn't have a lot of HP or armor, so they can easily be killed. Archers can't shoot at adjacent enemies, so they have to move away. Sometimes, your archers can only move away and can't act, so adjacent units can keep following them and killing the archers. So, you certainly want to protect the archers with blocking melee units. The game also has a pretty interesting list of battle spells. If you can't get behind a melee wall to the squishy archers, you could always resurrect one of the dead corpses as a zombie which can do the job. Just as well, the enemy could do that to you! So, to prevent that, you want to move your creatures on top of corpses to prevent their reanimation. That could also cause you to move onto a strategically disadvantageous position. Every army has a hero leading it, so the heros also directly participate in the battles. Heros can become very, very powerful as they level up. I find that an appropriately maxed warrior can pretty much solo every fight, but that strategy won't work forever.Your kingdom consists of your capitol and any conquered provinces. Each province yields a little bit of mana and/or gold per turn. This mana and gold is used for spells and recruiting units or constructing buildings. Some provinces will have strategic resources (such as logs) which will reduce the building costs of a building within your capitol. Each province can be improved to provide more resources. It seems that every turn, there are also a bunch of random events which happen within your kingdom. You have to read each event story and navigate a dialogue tree to respond to the event in some way. Each dialogue choice has a variable chance that it creates a favorable result or a negative result. The game events work on a sort of ""karma"" system, where choosing the ""evil"" choices results in negative karma but a short term gain, and choosing the ""good"" choice results in positive karma but generally incurs a cost. Over time, if your karma becomes really good, your kingdom will be flooded with positive events. If your karma becomes bad, you get flooded with bad events which get progressively more expensive.Meanwhile, you also also contending against one or more AI players who usually play with a slight advantage (cheaters!). You have to play particularly well in order to beat the AI.The game is also a bit unforgiving. You can't really just start a level, save at turn 15, play to turn 25, and then reload turn 15 if things go bad. The save game system only allows you to go back one turn, and if you reload, it also penalizes you by subtracting from your final score. You can restart an entire scenario from the beginning, but that too has a campaign cost (in terms of astral energy). So, you don't want to screw around and experiment. In some scenarios, an enemy wizard will directly attack your home world and you have to fend them off. If you lose, that's it. Game over. You lose. Roll credits. No reloading and trying again.In the campaign mode, you select which ""shards"" you want to conquer. Each shard unlocks two or more buildings for your capitol for each subsequent scenario. Some shards are extremely difficult to conquer if you don't have sufficient tech. So, you have to pick carefully which shards you want to conquer and in which order you want to conquer them based on the buildings they unlock.This game is very fun, very interesting, and very complex. If you can look past the graphics, I highly recommend it for any strategy minded players. There is a newer version of this game out which pretty much is this exact game (in terms of mechanics) but overhauls the graphics and UI (ooh, pretty sparkles!).There is only one significant downside to the game, and that is the drawback of its unforgiving save game system. I encountered a problem midway into one of my campaigns where my save game file got corrupted somehow. Since there wasn't any previous saved games, I lost hours of progress. I almost lost my entire campaign! I had to restart my shard scenario from the beginning.Currently, I haven't been playing this game lately because I am stuck on a particularly difficult invasion. An enemy wizard decided to attack my homeworld and the AI difficulty is set very high. In the three times I've tried, I can't seem to beat him. I must fight him off, and if I lose, the game is completely over. I've given up for now, but maybe in a few months I'll try again.			"

												My new favorite game.  Built on the shoulders of games like Master of Magic, Heroes of M&M, Westnoth, Warlords, it takes the best elements of these games and puts them all in one place.  Warning:  The game is super long and super challenging, I'll probably never finish it, but then that's not actually a problem ;)			"

												I've put loads of money to obtain PC with high-end Radeon just to get bored with modern games and spend my time playing this gem. This definietly is not a game for everyone, people who don't remember and love 90's gaming might not like these graphics and gameplay. But if you do, surely should you try it. Mix HoMM with Age of Wonders, some Civilization and add bonus content and it it Eador: Genesis. Game is very complex and, depending of your skills and terrain available, you might choose plenty of different approaches. Battles seem simplified, but when you dig into them, you discover more and more relevant factors, that can, literally, transform heavy defeat into a glorious victory. I'd write more, but have to play. Just one more turn. Or maybe, a hundred ;)			"

												I second every recommendation made on this game so far, with ONE addition :This game, doesn't give you its full research tree until you are veeeeeeeery deep into it, unlike other similar games where you get some really powerful game-breaking units after, let us say, 10 hours of gaming ... with Eador it might take you 30 hours to see the first building that will create a tier 2 unit for your cities. For me that is a definite plus as it keeps the playing time - and the mystery of the game - much much longer and much more interesting since the benefits of the shards which you have to choose from in each of the ""pick a shard to conquer"" turns is random as well.Full price is WORTH it ... but if you get it on a discount RUN to buy it as if it was iPhone 10 and you were the only person that knew it was coming out :p			"

												I would very much recommend this game, though if you already have ""Master's of a Broken World"" or vise versa then this is essentially the same game (before it got the fancy graphics).  This game is hard, so far as there is almost no documentation that can help you understand every singe battle/challenge/random event.  About the only thing you can do is dive in, play, lose, and do it all over again (I re-ran the tutorial about 3 times).  But once you do learn, and you conquer your first shard, well I for one was hooked.  This is not a game that you can ever just bide your time with, building up enough of an army, and a powerful enough hero.  Yes these are the things you must have to win, but the computer opponents are doing exactly the same things, and in many cases, they are much more aggressive.  You can find yourself surrounded, fighting to keep the enemy out of your strongholds, when only rounds earlier you thought you had the game well in hand.  Yes it is somewhat repetative (part of the game getting easier is that you eventually start to know what pattern or solution to a given ""random"" event is best), and there are times that it will feel unfair, but trust me.  When you bull rush an enemy strong hold, kill off 2 of his heroes, siege his castle, then finally banish him, all before HE was able to break away, then you too will know how much fun this game can be!

												A true hidden gem. If you like old school turn-based strategies you should try this one, it's ridiculously complex and ridiculously hard. The amount of content is really staggering, there is more than 200 buildings in your stronghold and I'm still getting new random events and discovering new things after 100+ hours of play. If I have one complaint it's that the game does poor job at explaining anything else than the very basics and the tutorial barely scratches the surface of the real gameplay. Which is not necessarily all bad, if you don't mind mastering the game the hard way and learning from your mistakes.			"

You read the reviews, every one is saying how great it is, don't knock it 'till you try it they say.  It's cheap and curiosity gets the better of you.  You give it a try.  Two weeks pass you have spent more time on it than you have complete major titles and you're still at the begining of the game.  You find excuses to play, you keep saying 'just one more turn'.  You start burning dinner, becoming later and later for work, missing appointments and you are seeing your family less and less.Like me you have become an addict, living from shard to shard.  Is there help for this?  I don't know.Quite frankly I don't want to know			"

												Must say I've become a bit addicted to this simple turn based strategy game. The references to the HoMM series are certainly apt, as even on the easiest difficulties Eador can be somewhat unforgiving at times with its checkmate AI making a nuisance in every uncovered corner. The amount of content is basically unlimited, which would be normally be a frustration for a completist such as myself, but oddly it's become instead one of the game's attractions and now I look at Eador as an excellent drop in/drop out strategy game, one I could actually beat were I to 'drop in' for about 300 hours or so. In addition to the skirmish style single player, Eador also offers a campaign mode consisting of 80 randomly generated 'scenarios', which apparently allows you to say you've 'beaten' the game should you be perserverent enough to successfully conquer 80 maps, any of which could take the better part of a day to complete. The gameplay and controls are solid, and although Eador can feel repetitive at times, it's no fault of the game's design but rather the frequent battles that often play out in familiar fashion. It's like a casual drop in strategy game that's been given a surprising sense of depth, and that in turn gives a satisfying weight to your daily bouts. Thumbs up.			"

												There is something magical about this game. The music hits all the right chords, singing to the heart of a child living in the 90's playing fantasy games for the first time. I have had this game on GoG for a couple of years and have put so many hours into it I don't even know. Even after what is probably hundreds of hours I still find new things and events, the game always throwing something new or different at you. The graphics to me are perfect, might not be everyones cup of tea but don't let that turn you away. The game has a ridiculous amount of depth and strategy which keeps me coming back for more. I bought it here on Steam to help promote it of sorts with a positive review because it deserves it. Anyone that I have suggested or bought this game for has had nothing but positive things to say about it. I know its not much a in-depth review but at its price and noticably positive feedback from others I suggest picking it up and finding out what those who play are talking about.			"

												What do you get when you take Heroes of might and Magic/ Kings Bounty combat and put it to use in a hex based medieval map reminicent of Civilisation 5, add it a bunch of dialogue stuff, mix the spices of fantasy. spin the mixture and boil it in a witchs pot with dragons fire and you basically get Eador Genesis. Reminds me abit of King Arthur except with the Heroes of Might and Magic hex combat. Its definitelly a Grand Strategy game that can go for quite along while, You are a DemiGod striving for the control of a shard, you hire heroes that you have do heroic stuff from fighting spiders and dragons. There are plenty of dialogue and choices that give morality. Will eat time really easily once you get in the paces of using rituals and managing heroes. Youve always got choices within your castle and you have alot of tech trees to chose. You can train evil/neutral/good units which all have differing stats and usefulness. You can easily have a good necromancer or an evil paladin. Bloody inquisition though. You either let your people get tortured witch trials style or you eternally get damned as a evil by the inquisition and will constantly attempt to ravage your lands. Still there are always more dialogue and such like a Pheonix lady that got cursed by her husband but yeah. Graphics are dated but mechanics carry the game really well and its enjoyable :D			"

Sadly the orignal one is better than is successor (by far). More so when you consider the extremely well done free mod ""New Horizon"" which expands and improves on every aspect of the game.

There is substance, hidden depths, and you're going to miss important stuff during the day up to the moment when some kind of family intervention pulls you out of it, because you are going to experience proper ""another turn"" vibes.Don't let the graphics and the UI put you off, trust me.  Give yourself half an hour to get past the initial feelings and you'll enjoy Eador: Genesis, whether you're playing it full screen like I do or in a small window.If you REALLY hate the way it looks… I don't know, put on some 3D glasses and pretend you're hallucinating, but play this game.

												This game is a turn-based strategy in the vein of Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Wonder. You have a city and a hero, and need to expand and kill stuff, which lets you build a better city, hero, and army, and so on. Eventually you run into enemy AI opponents, and if you've done well enough in the first part of the game you will be able to beat them into submission. Good concept.There are two problems that keep this game from being playable. First, it is a downgraded version of Eador: Broken Worlds. There's not much point in playing this since it became available after the superior polished sucessor.Second, it is -incredibly- slow. The campaign features a tremendous number of individual maps, with no unique mission objectives. When you win one of these, you get a small bonus to resource production and, if you're lucky, one extra building available for contruction. You don't actually build anything on the campaign map, this just unlocks another small option on the main map. The real issue is that every single map takes hours, each map takes more and more time as you progress through the campaign, and there are a really limited number of strategies available to keep this interesting.

												The game is great, probably one of the most fun games I've ever played. But I'm only writing this review to note something very important: THIS GAME DOES NOT HAVE WINDOWS 10 SUPPORT. And it runs very badly on Windows 8 and possibly 7. Requiring you to slow down your computer in the settings or refusing to go fullscreen. The hours I have in it were all spent in a very small windowed screen on Windows 7, reducing the quality of gameplay, obviously. Once I upgraded it refused to run at all. If you are looking to still play it however (Which you should, it's a great game.) I highly recommend Eador: Master of the Broken World, which is a 3d remake and offers the exact same experience, except it actually works.			"

												Чего не сделаешь ради значка...Почему eador? Потому что игра сделана почти одним человеком. Потому что игра грамотно затягивает своими текстами при обучении и заставляет жадно вчитываться во все сюжетные диалоги далее, а описание юнитов начинаешь читать из-за - ""ЁШКИН как же интересно!"". Потому что я люблю пошаговые игры всех мастей и eador достойный пример.Но, у игры, конечно же, есть минусы. Два основных это затянутость и репитативность (на высоких уровнях сложности существуют по сути только два-три патерна завоевания осколка за осколком, полный захват которых может занять 8-10 часов под конец игры). Однако это не мешает мне возвращаться в одиночный вне сюжетный режим, где настройки карты позволяют создать множество интересных ситуаций.			"

												If you ever thought to yourself: ""I want to play Heroes of Might and Magic, but I want to explore the whole game, as if I played it the first time."" Look no further!Eador is basically Heroes with unlimited content! It even got a (for the game type) decent narrative.Give it a try, you won't regret it!			"

HoMM Lookalike?Ok, I read in a review that this game is a Heroes of... lookalike, and I have to say, someone just playing the game for 0.1 hours might not have seen the full depth of the game. The campaign might have it's lengths - but on the other hand, you won't be sitting idly around playing it.The game (especially the campaing) tell a story, you have to conquer shards, to gain in power and influence. Each shard is divided into several provinces, which have inhabitants, quest and resources. There are common (Gold/Crystals) and uncommon resources (also called strategical resources - required for some units and buildings). You can unlock higher levels of buildings, units and equipment through developing your kingdom, your stronghold and of course by solving quest (sometimes there is stuff that ""seems"" to disappear, but in fact those nifty items are used for something else). Every decission you make will have it's repercussions - for example: You have a thieves guild in your province that is causing trouble, you attack them and catch their leaders. They plight to set free again, and offer you a deal (paying tax and a one time benefit to your coffers of 200 gold) or you can kill them instead and burndown their hideout. If you accept their offer the people of the province won't be too happy about it - so you might have to use something else to lighten up their mood. Oh, by the way - if you've been too much of a fool for gold (you'll see what I mean when you see some of the quests and tasks) you'll be getting a lot of uprisings to fight...Building, upgrading, exploring and solving quests is what is most of the time the staple in this game. In it's depth, the complexity and a lot of other ways this game is superior to HoMM... it's fun to play once you have overcome the, done these, done that.What I do like about this game:The complexity and depth of the game.The really easy to learn gameplay.The diversity of the game.The soundtrack of the game.The theme and story behind the setting.I recommend this game with a good 80 % of playability and fun...yes of course there are some minor, non gamebreaking bugs - and some exploits - which you might encounter sooner or later. But this game is a plain winner on my most Favorite Strategy - Empirebuilders... because it is much less railed then HoMM...			"

												The difficulty is ridiculous and fluctuates, the AI is terrible, it always just targets your weakest unit ignoring everything else in range and it takes way too long to get to the point in the campaign where you can have any variety in your stategy. I really wanted to like this game, it has the potential to be everything anyone could want in a 4x Strategy game but it's shortcomings quickly show and become more and more frustrating.Edit: All that said I still can't stop playing. So take that for what you will.			"

												Frustratingly difficult.I would recommend this game if it had any sense of difficulty and a learning curve.As is stands I would only recommend it too very frust resistant players with a lot experience in strategy games.It has serious balancing issues with some heroes way stronger than others.(General and Scout are just alot better than the rest is).Whats more while there are multiple difficulty settings even the easiest one is punishingly difficult and sometimes straight up unfair. This game does not take you by the hand to tell you what to do but will punish slight mistakes hard.The tutorial was very easy and will not prepare you in the slightest to what awaits you later.I stopped after a couple of hours and tries because this game just frustrates me.Graphics and Design: 7/10 (Old but with a nice touch to it. All in all fitting)Music: 7/10 (Oldschool with some nice tunes. Gets boring after a while)Strategic aspect and Depth: 9/10 (Surprisingly deep srategies and tactics. Alot of possibilities)Balance and Learningcurve: 1/10 (Read above. Kills the game for me)Final Score: 4/10Would only reccomend to hardcore players hat like hard games and roguelikes.If you are one of those this cheap game can entertain you for a long time I would think.

												Crashed my computer twice running this game (Windows 8, Intel I7 haswell processor, 4-core dual threaded)Turns out its because of 2 things:1 - I had more than one application running (IE I wasn't running JUST Eador)2 - my computer is too powerful. The only way to solve the animation bugs and the audio stuttering is to put my computer in power saver mode, and underclock the CPU.The 2nd time my computer crashed, I needed to run a repair on my OS, because it blew it up that spectacularly.If your computer is a toaster, this is the game for you.If your computer is worth more than $300, reconsider installing this, because there is the very real chance you will be unable to realistically run this game.

												So at first is was like ""Oh god no, please not another crappy nostalgia-like hexagonal tactical game"" but i decided to give it a try.And i enjoyed it !I played for hours, gradualy leveling my character and my army, discovering and conquering every piece of land i could, getting great gear and storing a crap load of money.And then i finished the map...And i had to start everything over on another one.Even though the reason why i have ot do this is explianed in the lore, it's still f*ing annyong to have the feeling i've waisted hours of my life making a perfect realm for nothing.If at least there was some achievements to earn, or if you could get just a fraction of what you got in the new map, that would be awesome.But no. There is nothing, and you just start over, listening at the same music again and again, doing the same things again and again, with crappy graphics and somehow laggy game.The idea was great, even i who don't like that king of game enjoyed playing the first map. But forget about the rest.			"

												There are better, more detailed and more extensive reviews for this game, so I'm just writting why I wouldn't recommend it.The main reason I bought Eador: Genesis was for the Hero and the combat system. You're the Hero, the commander of your army, you go explore the land and you actually fight.You improve your Hero and buy armor and weapons, and customize it to some sub-classes.With all that said, all that fails: The customization is completely random; at every level-up you are given 3 RANDOM ""masteries"" and choose to boost one. They're not useless but you can't choose what you want to become.If none of the masteries is what you want, then you HAVE TO choose the ""passive"" or ""main"" (say Magic Dmg for Wizard, Attack for Warrior, Range plus Attack for Scout).Sorry, but for a RPG feature this is a SHAME. You don't actually know how many masteries are or when are you getting the one you'll like. You don't even know which are the sub-classes or what skills will you need. You can't customize your Hero the way you want knowing NOTHING.Then again, the army recruitment and management system is terrible: You pay many kinds of soldiers to help you in battle. They level up and get some stats, skills and stuff... then in some random not-favorable battle they die and... your time spent in that unit, developement and EVERYTHING is just destroyed and you have to hire a lvl 0 unit again.There's only one ""save slot"" for Campaign Mode, so if you want to try a class, you have to erase your previous game data.If you played lets say... 30 hours the Warrior and you need a rest or you want to try a new Hero, you're gonna LOSE 30 hours of your life just to find you hate the Scout and want your Warrior back.The autosave is also annoying because every time you exit the Campaign, it autosaves. This means you learn the game from your mistakes, but the hardest way possible, and nothing can be undone.Well, if you don't mind some of these features and just like the strategy and empire building... this game is maybe for you.Definetly not for me.

Nostalgia is a powerful spice when it comes to taste in games. Otherwise, I'm afraid its just not a good game, like at all. AVOID!*** UPDATE*** Through a comment, I found out this isn't even an old game. Made in 2009 this game has very little excuse for such a poor interface/presentation/art/animation/ect... I understand being an indie studio you may not have the resources to pour into certain areas, but there can be artistic descisions made to soften the edges of a lower budget. Also the gameplay - core to indie games - was just not that fun or engaging. So bottom line - didn't think it could be any worse, now I do. Worse than a bad free flash game, and you have to pay for it. Ouch.			"
