												In my opinion, Cubemen is a ludicrously underrated game. It is incredibly simple in concept but it is executed incredibly well making it a huge amount of fun, the really simple but highly polished graphics also give this game a great charm to it. Cubemen is a blend of Tower Defense and Real Time Strategy, something that can be very difficult to balance but Cubemen does it relatively well. There are a nice variety of units to chose from and an eclectic selection of official & community-made maps that give this game a lot of playability in both single and multiplayer games, this is a great game to play either alone or with friends.Another thing that I love about Cubemen along with it's simplistic but great graphics is the brilliant soundtrack, it may be minimal in variety and some tracks sound like remixes of others but there are some really good pieces that fit perfectly into the games art style. The hardest thing to achieve in any Strategy or Tower Defense game is balance, and even though Cubemen does it fairly well, it also has some unfortunate flaws; they aren't necessarily global flaws as the problems only seem to occur on certain maps, but the issue is still there. This is the fact that there is one particular strategy that works 95% of the time said maps, mainly some of the earlier ones but is also prominent on the later/more advanced maps too. If you rush the enemy spawning towers with basic infantry early on, it can be incredibly easy to dominate the rest of the game by pumping more and more infantry to that location. Like I said, this doesn't happen on all maps, just a handful, it is also my only real problem with this game.Another flaw is that some infantry can feel fairly redundant such as Freds or Sids whereas other infantry like Grills, Flints and Rickys can dominate the grid most of the time in large numbers. This is again the balancing issue that lurks in these kind of games, it's a very difficult thing to overcome but non-the-less, it is nice to have a selection of units to chose from, especially since it doesn't clog up the interface and use minimal space. So as this game is fairly cheap and is practically given away during sales, I would suggest trying it out if you're a fan of Tower Defense or RTS games. I believe some of the reviews that this game has recieved are relatively harsh and undeserved, sure, it has some issues but what game doesn't? This game and it's sequel are a lot of fun so if it's going for cheap or is in a bundle, I highly recommend it! I'm looking at you, my Command & Conquer buddies.Also, for the record, those of you that call this game a ""Minecraft ripoff"" are clearly morons.			"

												Cubemen was a strange experience for me. Somehow I had gotten myself a little excited about this game, not sure why, it didn't exactly have much of a hype going for it. But there I was, actually looking forward to this game. And boy was I disappointed. Cubemen is a Tower Defense game. You place your towers, or cubemen on the map and move them around as necessary to shoot the enemies who will come at you from a multitude of spawnpoints on the map. They use a variety of weapons who's damage potential, type of damage and accuracy varies decently. Unfortunately several easy strategies exist to completely overpower the enemy early and take command of the game to the point where any challenge disappears out the window. The random accuracy does provide some problems though as an early rush strategy that sometimes wins you the map with no casualties will other times make you lose without killing a single enemy. This randomness, combined with the reliability of camping the enemy spawns makes the strategy very shallow. You never have to spend much time contemplating unit placement or even which units to purchase beyond the first 2 minutes of a map. The problem is that Cubemen is a very, very simple game. It'll take you five minutes to learn how to play it and ten to master it completely. The economy questions are virtually nonexistent, all enemies and maps can be met with the same strategies and the is virtually no challenge to be found in the game. Despite the multi-player being cross-platform with mobile devices it is almost completely dead which is probably not a bad thing, considering the broken balance. It is a game that gives you no reason to continue playing once you've done the first 30 minutes. Only the achievements exist to keep you playing but even that is just a mindless grind.			"

												Cubemen is a strategy tower defense game, where you and your army of cubes defend the enemy forces from taking over you base.I had 100+ hours on my phone, so I have experience beyond Steam.Pros:-Easy gameplay-Addictive-Great soundtrack-Easy controls-Custom  skins for cubes and levels-Hilarious-Fairly Quick gameplay-Different gamemodes-Easy to develop strategiesCons:-Not many people play it anymore-Singleplayer can get pretty boring after a while- no storymode (but the second game has one)- When you develop a strategy, if becomes repetive and boring.I will reccomend this game, but I'd reccomend you either gift or get your friends to buy it as well so you can play together so it won't get as boring as quick. But if your looking for a fungame to last you a couple days, I'd also reccomend it.7.5/10			"

												It’s not a *bad* game.  The concept is novel, the graphics feel pretty polished, and the team obviously cared about the game they were building.But the sign of a great strategy game is balance.  Unfortunately Cubemen lacked this in 2 important ways.  1) The  strategy to beating every Defense level is the same.  I thought the game was extremely hard at first when I was trying to sit back and defend, but then I discovered that if you rush the spawn point with the 2 basic units, you can win nearly every Defense level.  A few of the 35 levels did require some thought, particularly the last one, but really only in the early game.  But even these ultimately came down to the same strategy, it was just harder to do immediately: surround the spawn point, then wait for the win.2) The wide variety of units doesn’t really matter.  This piggybacks off #1.  You can win every level (except the last one) with just Grills and Flamers (maybe even just Grills).  If you have enough to build Rickies, you probably are going to win anyway.  This made the game fairly one-dimensional.I think this aspect actually drives people away from the multiplayer; they get a sour first impression and can’t get over it.Best of luck to the team in their future projects, at any rate!  I know there has since been a sequel;  I may give that a spin to see if some of these things are addressed there.			"

												Cubemen is a decent RTS/Tower Defense game that does well with what little it contains. The use of ""cubemen"" instead of towers and their ability to move around on the battlefield can make you rethink your strategies, especially since they can be destroyed by the enemy that is approaching you. The oncoming enemies can also pack weaponry so strategic selection and placement of your cubemen is critical for your success. In skirmish mode the game becomes even more entertaining with the addition of an enemy commander which will command it's own tower-like cubemen. You also get the basic foot soldiers that will mindlessly attack the enemy base every round. The wide variety of maps make up the majority of the difficulty differences, along with a couple other changes. This is a great little game and well worth the couple bucks it costs.			"

												Now let me be honest here. I am not the best gamer when it comes to strategy, but even with that in mind, this game is bloody hard. Before I get to that, I will say that the graphics and music of this game are fun, and enjoyable. But; the gameplay is slightly unbalanced, call me a whiner, but in the early levels of the game, grenedeirs (excuse my spelling) Totally out-gun you. You really don't stand a chance, however, the freeplay matches are actually somewhat enjoyable.On to the multip- wait, what multiplayer? No one plays this game online, really, no one. So I wouldn't bother. The level creator is fun, and is well deisgned, I would reccomend making some of your own levels for gameplay, although no one is going to play them online, seeing my above statement on multiplayer.Overall, the game is fun and challenging, to good generals this would be a fun and replayable game, I however, out of personal taste, don't like the game all to much.Overall 6.5/10			"

The stategy element involves buying block people which represent different classes like grunts with rifles, flame-throwers, morters, grenaders, lasers, snipers and so on. The idea of the game is to win at a war of attrition by beating the enemy's waves in a tower-defence kind of way.It's a fun little game and fun to compare your score to other's online but beyond that I don't know much.

												I got this in the Humble Bundle and thank GOD I didnt pay full price for this.The game just falls into repetition after repetition, all three game types are the same, but with more people and different maps, that is literally it.The supposed ""open endedness"" of the game is one of its main downfalls, since instead of the standard tower defense multiplayer formula ""Here is your end, you cant place anything in the other players end, but theres a no mans land thats all yours if you can fight for it"" the game does this:You can place Units anywhere! (that we've set) even next to the enemy spawn point!Thats it, and that makes it frustrating, it takes all the fun out of the usual cunning and strategy of a game like this, and instead the only way to win is just spawncamping/killingThats it, thats the only way to win and the AI knows it, as thats the only tactic I've ever seen it employ.This is made even worse by the fact that when a Unit is going towards a spot, no-one else on any team can go to that spot, even if they would beat them to the spot by miles, making defense of your base harder, and spawn killing way easier.I LIKE tower defense games and I LIKE RTS games... but I simply dont like this as everything is the same, and the only way to win is to be totally unfair.To top it all off the AI is so incompetent it hurts, as in it hurts my head from how many times I smashed my head into my desk after seeing my units attacking someone who they were missing continuously, who was also very far away, and wasnt even attacking me, instead of the units right next to him that were actively shooting him!To end this review professionally: The AI is rubbish, the game is boring and repetitive, and the only way to win is by being a complete c*nt, DO NOT buy this game.

												Decent tower defense game but the interface lets it down.  e.g. unlike in most RTS games where you select units with a left click and move/order with a right click, here you do both with the left button.  Sometimes you need to give a lot of orders quickly and it's too easy to end up misclicking.The right mouse button is used to move the camera, but this could easily have been put on the spacebar or some other key.The balance between the different unit strengths, their cost etc. is interesting enough, and there's a broad range of difficulty available - some levels are dead easy, others are diabolical.  Will probably only keep your interest for a few hours unless you're really into it and want to push for achievements/high scores.			"

												If you're going to talk about true inovations in the gaming conduit, you'd be amiss if you were to not include Cubemen. With a graphics engine that can be compared to actual life, it exceeds Call Of Duty and Battlefield in many areas. One of these areas is it's physics engine- one that can be compared to the amazing feats done by Bad Rats. The game is great from the start, but only gets better. Near the end of the story, it's revealed that the main-character's wife has remained unfaithful with the main character, frequently going to strip clubs and giving volunteering men things she calls ""Rusty Jammers"". The twists and turns will leave you on the edge of your seat, folks. You heard it from CINN-E-MON first! Go buy this gem!			"

												Yet another tower defense game. Cubemen has no upgradeable towers. Instead of towers you use cubemen (duh). They are put on cube blocks and can actually move around freely. But they're not upgradeable. During my playtime it came down to spamming enough men to kill the incoming enemy forces. There were very little tactics involved. There's a bit of fun to be had, I guess. I just expected more strategy from a tower defense game.[Rating: 62/100]			"

												This is a hit & run's TD game. Enemies will attack your units, so you need to move your unit to other positions for avoiding their attack. If you don't do that, you can't pass the advanced levels. But it is hard to control all your units and that will increase unnecessary difficulty.Hit&Run式的塔防，站桩就是等死，不过兵种太少啦。可玩性不高			"

												I got this as part of the Humble Bundle a while back. The only reason I'm not absolutely furious about this game being in my library is because I actually do enjoy a few of the other games I got in that bundle.This game is repetitive. Every level follows the exact same idea, and after about the very first one, it just gets tedious.This game is incredibly difficult, and not in a good way. The enemies attack the men that you place throught the level. This could be seen as a good thing, if not every dingle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ one of them fired on the same guy at the same time. In the time it takes you to be able to destroy a single enemy, pretty much every one of your towers has been destroyed, and you sure as hell don't have the money to replace them.			"

Before I get to that, I found the graphics and music ofthis game to be fun and enjoyable, but the game play is slightlyunbalanced, but in the early levels of the game, the grenadiers are abit to difficult. You really don't stand a chance, however, thefreeplay matches are actually somewhat enjoyable.The level creator is fun, and is well designed, I would recommendmaking some of your own levels for gameplay.Overall, the game is fun and challenging, to good generals this wouldbe fun and it has replay value.Overall 7/10But 3 Sprockets have made a sequel to it and I haven't tried it outyet but it sure seems better than the original			"

												Takes tower defence and makes it obscure and unfun. How anyone could managed to do that is beyond me.You spawn your men and move them into position, and within 5 seconds they've been killed.Oh? Didn't you realise? It's a poor mans RTS too. The enemy shoot back.It would be ok, except for the fact that in tower defence you have a few guys against a few hundred enemies. It's hard enough moving 1 ""tower"" around without him dying, let alone 2.So you move your one ""tower"" around desperately trying to keep him going, and your other guy bites the dust. Mean while the enemy is pouring into the level and you can only keep 1 guy alive.Poor high res UI doesn't help either.Shovelware.			"

												What do we have here? A tower defense like game! Looks interesting! Well, just for a bit. The problem with this game is that it's somewhat simple thanks to the power of rushing. Thanks to that you can easily overpower enemy on a lot of maps, but you could still play it the ""right"" way... But there's another problem: it gets boring a tad too fast.Okay, enough of the bad things, let's see what's good (or not). The whole idea itself of ""moving"" tower defense is brilliant. Execution is very simple and effective. I mean, look at it! It's all so... Neat!All in all it's still a tad fun game until it lasts. Unfortunately it doesn't last long enough. Maybe it's... Too simple?Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

From here, I was loosing every time. Tried being stratigic, but it acompolished nothing. Unless your Tower Defence skills are expert,  I would stay away from this.			"

												So ♥♥♥♥ing hard to play this game, it at least takes me 500 hours to understand the basics as you can see with TF2, but this game is really hard, you can't crash into a building, you have stop them from building, even though there is a mode where you can attack a building, it doesn't make sense, you have to stop them from ♥♥♥♥ing you and then try to ♥♥♥♥ them! It's not fair. Either way, there are no cheats! Which makes it even harder to play, with TF2 I played 383.4 hours in singleplayer with bots... with cheats. And in neither Cubemen 2 or 1, they have NO cheats at all. I strongly recommend this game for no reasona at all. You have to pay to play a game that's really fun! Why? To support the developers! IDK why?Ok, let's start with the good-robots-multiple units-Easy to understand if you look at the tutorial-fun!The bad!-Hard to play when in Hard-hard to play without tutorial-too complicated-Confusing name!Ok, so my Final Verdict is................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 10/10			"

												This game has no balance. It's basically a game you play when you need your mood ruined. The computer doesn't have the resource problems you suffer at every turn, his units hit things better and generally don't crumble away before being useful.In short, don't buy this game. The concept itself isn't great, and the horrible, horrible gameplay doesn't help one bit. It's not worth your however little money.			"

Still powering through it to get platinum medals in everything.The interface is friendly and the game really does make you think really hard about your strategies and plans. Even if you don't like simple/casual games, this one puts you to the test.			"

												Cubeman is a very barebones strategy game. The idea is pretty simple: You're given a variety of nondescript cubic soldiers, all of which require a certain amount of resources to be summoned, and are tasked with positioning them on the battlefield in a way that will give you control over your opponent. All units perform a different task and all of them do better under certain conditions, so choosing where to place each of them is vital to your victory.The gameplay, albeit solid, can be kind of slow and boring at times. Its basic nature makes it so that there isn't a lot of room for strategy in it: Position your units correctly, and soon you can start spamming heavy-hitters, giving your opponent little to no room for recovery. It feels more like a slaughterfest than it does like an actual strategy game. The online community is pretty much dead, and after you figure out the game mechanics, beating the AI opponents isn't too hard.Graphically, there isn't much to say: They don't suck, but they're not very appealing either. I give the designers credit for giving you the option to customize how your soldiers and the levels look. A+ for going the extra mile.The soundtrack is actually pretty good. It's not something I would listen to on my free time, but I took notice of it when I first started the game and was very pleased with it while I played. Deserves a special mention because of that.In the end, I think cubemen will appeal more to those who aren't very into the RTS genera and looking for something simple that will help them get into it. It's a very solid game and it can definitively be a lot of fun if you have a friend to play with. For its low pricetag, it’s definitively a worthwhile deal.			"

												This stylistic and quirky tower defense is tons of fun and even better with friends. The sound track is perfect doesn't get boring after playing for extended periods of time. In my opinion, this is better than Cubemen 2. If you're in to this genre of game you should definitely grab it, especially if its on sale.			"

												I haven't even played this damn game yet and I recommend it to you, my friends. The reason is this game represents true American patriotism. By that, I mean the game is about little dudes made out of cubes destroying each other. From watching the original launch trailer, I can see that this game is some kind of child spawned from tower defense and Final Fantasy tactics' dad. The game is only 4.99 and that is enough to make it awesome in my book. You can't even get a McDonald's value meal for that price and at the same time it's more than a McDonald's employee makes in an hour. Don't forget to have a beer before playing. I prefer a Golden Monkey which is a Belgian-style tripel. It packs a 9.5% ABV wallop. If you can't afford expensive brew, drink two Bud Light Platinums.			"

												A fun little tower defense game.  In the main mode, you spawn little cube guys, the enemy sends waves at your base.  You can move your men around, which is a nice spin on tower defense.  Lots of different maps, all of which are available from the go - which for me was a con, as I like the feeling of beating a level before moving on to the next.   There are two multiplayer modes, both of which are fun if you like competive tower defense.  Good for a short romp if you pick it up on sale.			"

Cubemen is great for people who like a simplistic, appealing look while having many options and choices in gameplay. There is even an easy to use level editor and multiplayer so you can play with friends! I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of tower defense style games, wide options in gameplay, and six sided shapes.Definitely worth the price.10/10			"

												This is a great Indie game to hone your strategy skills. There are quite a few different ways to customize your cubemen, and the enemy as well. Each character has it's advantages and disadvantages, so you have to sort out where each unit works best. You get everything from flamethrowers to particle beams to snipers. Almost all of the playing fields are challenging and make you think in their own way. Each of the three modes is also very enjoyable. All in all, great game.			"

												Would be a nice strategy game , but it is way too easy to reach a perfect stalemate , if you don't end the match at the first few minutes of the match. I fought a guy and we reached a perfect stalemate , he sent his soldiers to try and beat me , but my soldiers and everything else killed the incoming enemy soldiers , same with the soldiers I send , I send them he kills them , he sends soldiers I kill them. There are maps where a perfect stalemate is not easy to do , but they are meant to be played by 4-6 people.I give it 6/10 , I guess. "

												A fun little tower defense game.  In the main mode, you spawn little cube guys, the enemy sends waves at your base.  You can move your men around, which is a nice spin on tower defense.  Lots of different maps, all of which are available from the go - which for me was a con, as I like the feeling of beating a level before moving on to the next.   There are two multiplayer modes, both of which are fun if you like competive tower defense.  Good for a short romp if you pick it up on sale.			"

												A tower tefence game in its most basic form. It doesn't have an official story mode, which is what I believe this game suffers from because there is no sort of progression other than achievements that don't give anything. It hampers the experience even if there are a lot of things that you can do. It would have been fine if there were more people playing for the multiplayer aspect of the game to shine. Also, once you figure out the strategy in beating a level, that's pretty much the same strategy you will use everything else.It's a good entry to the Tower Defence genre but it doesn't have enough ""star"" power to keep me entertained for longer than 30 minutes.

												This is one of the best tower defense games I've ever played! (And I've played dungeon defenders :P). Cubemen isn't really a tower defense game, in the sense that the towers are men. You can have them run around to other vantage points. Plus, unlike regular tower defense, you don't just wait for the enemy to come to you. You can actually send your troops at the enemy. Its epic! Give it a shot. Especially at this low price. ~PR0XIDIAN			"

												Cubemen is a tower defense game by where you place moveable soliders (the towers) to defend your spawn from the enemy onslaught. Pros:-Art style. I mean just look at it.-The cubemen (all classes) have their specific purpose.-All levels can be played as vs with 2 people.-Custom levels (make your own/download)-Pretty good difficulty (minus a few levels that have spikes)-Alternative modes, like rockets only, limited units, etc.Cons:If i can think of one major con it is that the general loop is mostly the same from level to level. You start having to build the cheapest units and then just survive long enough to build rocket,heal, and laser units.  It isnt always the case, but most of the time, that was my strategy. You could beat the levels in other ways.Overall, i would give it something like a 7.3.  Not amazing, but not bad.			"
