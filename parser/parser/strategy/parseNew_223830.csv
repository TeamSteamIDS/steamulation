												I finally completed my first Normal Ironman run in Xenonauts after many rage quits, forced restarts... and forgetting to deactive my C4 explosives only to pink mistify half my squad (way... waayyyy too many times). There were many moments that had me mumbling at my screen in frustration or outright had me getting up from the computer, going to the gym, and lifting things up then putting them down over and over again to get the angst out. It was incredibly frustrating to have some of my wet-behind-the-ears soldiers survive a few missions and pulverize some Xeno scum, only to watch them get one shot by a well placed shot or devoured by a Reaper I didn't plan for. Cover isn't intuitive (or at least for me it wasn't) and there were multiple times I took position only to watch the alien turn, smirk at me, then plant a plasma bolt square between the eyes of one of my soldiers. Refer back to the rage and lifting portion.Eventually, after epic (and possibly unhealthy) amounts of nerd rage and QQ'ing over cheating alien scum, how insanely difficult breaching UFOs is (Corvettes! I'm specifically hating on you!), and having to make aggrevating economic decisions... I learned from my mistakes (gasp!), had to learn to accept losses, and got better.I actually started using squad level tactics like hugging walls, throwing down smoke grenades if I absolutely had to turn a blind corner with no indication of what could be waiting on the other side, NOT sprinting down the middle of the street with my entire squad, then getting upset that I got sniped from a random window, making liberal use of explosives even if it meant I lost some money breaching UFOs, and generally just accepting I'm supposed to be out gunned.The game is remarkably well paced, freakishly so. Due to the ticker implementation RIGHT when you finally have outfitted your fighter jets or soldiers with the appropriate gear new bigger, badder aliens show up that almost make your hard fought gains obsolete. One step forward, two steps back is a common theme throughout the game that makes you BETTER because you have to actually think about WTF you're doing and why.I'm a father of three, married, and I have a job that has me at work anywhere from a standard 40 hours a week to almost 60, so it took me a month to get through the game. I guess I could've used the common complaint/logic ""I don't have that kind of time"" or ""I want something I can sit down and beat in a few days"" but this was far more rewarding. Yes, there were days where after a 12 hour shift I certainly didn't come home and boot up any games, but the time invested was worth it.I'm glad I stuck with Xenonauts despite my initial frustrations and will be putting many more hours into it either by tweaking the config file or by downloading mods. I actually tried playing XCOM: EU again and couldn't bring myself to do it.If you've made it through the wall of text (hurray!) I guess I'd split it into three categories:The Good:-Excellently designed game that gives you total freedom, no ♥♥♥♥ty tutorials shall be thrust on you here.-The pacing is genius! I don't know how long it took them, but the game ups the difficulty at the right moment. (unless you're playing bad, then you'll never catch up)-Soldiers have no role, you determine what they do based on what equipment you give them. Have a guy with high TU (action points)? Make him your scout! Have a guy with amazing accuracy but maybe his HP is kind of low? Sniper! Found a meat shield with high HP and incredible strength, but he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn at point blank range with a fully automatic weapon? Give him a metal shield and let him be a bullet sponge! Or don't do any of those things, it's up to you.-Aliens appropriately out tech you through out pretty much the entire game. You genuinely feel an overwhelming sense of dread as you play the game.-You will take losses, but that doesn't mean you'll lose the game. You can have pretty substantial set backs and still come out on top. (kind of like how life is!)-Using squad level infantry tactics ACTUALLY works and is necessary.-Well thought out tech tree and research progression.-You can mod and edit the crap out of the game to your liking.-Music is well done and adds to the setting.The Bad:-Even on Easy this game will be too much for a lot of people. This will be viewed as an ""elitist"" comment, but I think that's more indicative of the gaming industry as a whole and not to Xenonaut's detriment. Nintendo games were soul crushingly difficult and only had one mode, now many games I can hand my six year old that he can beat without having to read any of the text.-Still some glitches/bugs, namely shooting through walls. It doesn't happen too often, but it can make a huge difference to how that one map will play out.-The game doesn't explain a lot of the mechanics adequately. This can amplify frustration or make it more rewarding as you progress, depends on your perspective.-Mind control late game is a bit out of whack. I thought it added a great deal of intensity and dread, but it was depressing to watch two of my colonels that had managed to survive +30 missions get possessed and murder each other. I think it's a great (and necessary) part of the game, but still needs tweaking in either lower % success rate (which you can do yourself) or a turn delay the same way Wraiths can't teleport and shoot in the same turn.The Ugly:-Graphics. Eventually they grew on me, but it was admittedly jarring at first.			"

												Xenonauts. It's greatest strength is that it's X-com. It's greatest weakness is that it's X-com.If you're an older gamer, played the original X-coms, and just wanted them to get a graphics update and maybe some mods on being able to better organise your units and maybe a few updates, look no further. You've found it. If you don't know what this ""X-com"" business is about, both X-com and Xenonauts are tactical and strategic games where you defend earth from an alien invasion through a specialised organisation and squad who deals with the aliens. You'll respond to the aliens by shooting down the UFOs using regular human fighter aircraft, and then landing a squad of soldiers with just plain old human guns near them to clear out the survivors. After that, you'll begin to research better technology. Laser rifles, faster aircraft to take down the UFOs, armour that protects from the alien weaponry, and so on.You will meet several different kinds of aliens, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and figure out why they're invading. But most importantly, you're going to stop them. You're going to take all their technology and make it your own, and you will end up with several bases across the world to find, and destroy any intruders who push into your atmosphere.As for the changes between this and X-com, they are mostly good. You have an airstrike option on alien crash sites so that you don't need to do everything or have them expire when you've been too busy dealing with other sites, though it will provide you with far less rewards than if you send in a squad of soldiers. There are new pieces of equipment, such as the shield. You'll no longer need to micromanage every last clip or laser battery in your arsenal and order the construction of small things like two laser batteries - Just keep track of the ones you bring into combat so you don't run out. There are now more involved air battles, along with air terror sites. And cover, along with range, now actually provides a bonus or penalty to your shots. You don't have to worry about this turning into a chest high wall simulator though, it works out well and you don't have to stay in cover. It's just a suggestion that increases your soldiers' lifespan. There are some others but they are mostly positive. One I'd say is slightly negative is that you can not land on a UFO and blast a hole in the ceiling to enter it as you could in the original X-com, though if you never played that game(And even if you did), you might not even notice that option isn't there.Mechanics wise, it works out very similar to X-com, with an isometric view and tile based map. I've found some maps had too little vertical space sometimes but often this wasn't a big problem, the controls are pretty good, mainly just using your mouse to command your units.  It's turn based, with a world map to place your bases on and do your air battles, and a base overview where you can build out your base by modular rooms.Interestingly, I've found that the difficulty settings actually changes AI behavior, rather than the lazy way of just giving the AI more armour or damage. I'm not sure if it also gives the aliens more stats or makes it more difficult to get money for the player, but the fact difficulty settings actually improve the AI is something that many AAA games completely fail at.In the end, it's X-com. It has most of the strengths of X-com, but it also has the flaws of X-com. You may need to restart several times if you're new and you might get discouraged. A random lucky shot could kill off your best soldier and send the nearby rocket launcher guy into a berserk panic state right into your own squad. If you're not used to it, you'll wonder just how long the campaign keeps going and it may turn into a game of 'whack-a-UFO' for you with slow or barely noticable progress. Or you may simply not have a clue what's going on until the aliens are already in a better position than you.Even then, it's a very good game. I would say it's worth grabbing it at some point if you want to see what the fuss is about, or because you want some more of the X-com from long ago (Without looking at Interceptor or Enforcer for now)			"

Early Access Review
								If you're looking for a game that captured the feeling of the original X-Com then look no further.With stellar 3d to 2d rendered sprites, an art style and design the is reminiscent of an older generation of games though I think it would be going too far to call it ""retro"". Its both pleasing to the eye and has excellent clarity, all the information you need at the tip of your eyeballs and fingers to make the best strategic and tacticle decisions to defeat the disgusting xeno threat.The gameplay is heavily inspired by the bygone days of the past, with enough updates, improvements and modernizations that streamline the drudgery of the past (like the micromanagement intense menu screens of the original X-Com that are themselves evoke thoughts of Dwarf Fortress un-modded) into a lighter area by trimming back the intensity of the learning curve (such as buying ammo, etc) leaving the player with the same amount of depth and variety without leaving newer players in quicksand googling guides.If you're looking for a game where no one dies, aliens are made of paper and losing is impossible - look elsewhere. Your best men can be cut down like wheat by the advanced alien troops, who can at times seem to be made out of 40ft thick brick walls with angry faces painted on them. The risk of having your best men enhances the gameplay so much more than I would have thought, I truly cared about each soldier and shook my fist at the alien menace when my important men were gunned down mere feet from the landing craft.Theres a lot to this game, and if you're still on the fence there are plenty of videos on Youtube of people playing it - go look there and you'll find some great gameplay videos for the most part!Just be wary, some of the videos are old and may be on outdated builds that have bugs which no longer exist in this release and if I do have anything negative to say about this game its that it isn't a fully polished release and bugs do crop up from time to time, the majority of which aren't gamebreaking but once in a while I've seen a bug cripple someones game despite myself not having seen one.

												Xenonauts – a remake of a game of old.UFO: Enemy Unknown is one of the most influential games ever made. This is clearly visible by the amount of games that tried to mimic its gameplay like Altar’s UFO series or UFO Extraterrestrials and XCOM Enemy Unknown to name a few. Still some people were not satisfied by the above and wanted to recreate the know experience to their liking. One such project is Xenonauts.My first encounter with this game was not a rather positive one. I saw it at a friend. The game was half finished with tons of missing graphics and an unfinished campaign. After this experience I forgot about this game for several months until some sale on Steam and since I had some extra cash I gave the game a second chance (I’m a sucker for his kind of gameplay and own every commercially released UFO game and their clones for PC).The game itself is almost a direct clone of UFO: Enemy Unknown though there are several differences. Setting wise, the game is set in 1980’s during the cold war. As a bonus to the game you get a free novella in a PDF format, titled “Crimson Dagger” by Lee Stephen, which serves as an introduction to the game setting and describes in detail the first human contact with the aliens (quite a nice read). Apart from the setting, the most obvious difference is seen as soon as you start the game – there is no rotating globe, just a flat map of the earth. Than again the graphic design of the game is very nice, esthetic and functional. The core gameplay is identical to the original – you start with one base, some interceptors, a troop transport, soldiers, scientists and engineers and slowly advance the story by assaulting shot down or landed ufos, researching alien tech, acquiring new weapons, armor, craft and vehicles up until the final mission when you save the earth for good. And this all works pretty well. A nice touch is the casualties counter which track the number of people killed due to alien activities and also the on map reports of various event like forest fires, tidal waves, strafing runs ets. which might help to track a ufo outside of radar range. Some people might not like that certain parts of the game are more streamlined. There is no need to buy the basic weapons or ammunition, for both soldiers and jets. All is provided free and in unlimited quantity. Furthermore, jets have a fixed set of armaments per jet type and all upgrades to weapons installed on them are done automatically after researching certain technology, also free of charge. This take a lot of base management of ones mind though it comes at a price in ingame currency. First, funds are scares and getting stuff from ufos for sale is a must. Second, loosing a country is quite easy as building a new base is expensive, not to mention the prices for manufacturing new craft, armor or weapons for you troops. Furthermore, there is no possibility of self funding your efforts by selling weapons that you manufacture as the selling prices are way below the production costs.As for the combat part of the game, there are two types – dog fighting ufos in the air and ground combat in the form of assaulting grounded ufo, alien bases or defending cities in terror missions. The air combat is the part I like the least about this game. Its done with a pseudo radar view of the situation where a squadron (1 to 3 jets) you sent to deal with a ufo is under your direct command in an RTS like manner. You have to manage the position of your craft, range of your and enemy weapons, represented by cones projected from craft silhouettes, fuel reserves and craft health. The key it to either take out the enemy with your long range missiles or to try to get you planes in the ufo’s blind spot and use you short range weapons. If you get in trouble you can press special keys to dodge incoming fire or use the afterburners to fly quicker but use more fuel. If things get nasty, you can order your jets off the combat field and run away. All in all I’m very glad that the creators of the game gave players the option to auto resolve this part of the game. For me it’s a blessing as I really didn’t like this particular air combat system.The ground combat, on the other hand, is done extremely well. The graphics are sharp, clean and present different types of object on the map in a way that players will immediately understand. The animations of units, both your and aliens are nicely done and you rarely have problems distinguishing units one from another. Terrain sets are varied and depict farmlands, cities (in Eastern European, US and middle east styles), military bases, forests and sub-polar regions. The alien craft themselves are varied and interesting on their own. The combat itself is done in turns using a time units system for performing actions. What is nice is that the game will inform you how many points an action costs before performing it (e.g. little numbers by the target indicator before a shot is fired) or how many time units will be left after moving a desired distance. Furthermore, a cover system is implemented, not unlike the XCOM Enemy Unknown, which has to be always taken into consideration when positioning your troops. It works by reducing chance to hit a target that is obstructed by a peace of cover, be it a bush, a fence or a fridge inside a kitchen (the game show which objects reduces the to hit chance by how many %). But its done only when you actually want to take a shot and you never know how good your soldiers cover actually is. Another interesting feature is the suppression system. Every weapon has a chance of suppressing an opponent and machineguns excel at that. A suppressed unit immediately looses all time units it currently had (especially dangerous when your soldier is suppressed by reaction fire), and on their next turn their starting time units are reduced by half. Add riot shields to the mix, which soak up damage very nicely and leave one hand free to fire a pistol or use a stun baton, and you can get a lot of combat options unavailable even in other remakes. On the down side, grenades have no primer regulation. Regular ones explode at the end of the turn while smoke or stun ones immediately after they land on the ground. Additionally, in certain situations the units can get behind object which the game engine does not make transparent. This is annoying as it is difficult to position your men to you liking or you can just “loose” them on the battlefield and not use them for a turn or two. But still, tactical combat should satisfy most of the old UFO fans. As with the air combat, there is also an option not to go and clean up a shoot down ufo and just air strike it. This way you get a fixed amount of cash, dependent on the ufo type. The downside is that you don’t get any special resources from the ufo and after performing a ground mission you always get more cash.Lastly, sound and music. As for the sound design all is done OK. Every alien, weapon, action has its own distinct sound and after w few hours into the game you will know what happened just by the sound produced, which is especially important in ground combat missions. The part that made a really big impression on by was the music, especially the one in tactical missions. For some time I was looking for a good modern version of the track played on the original – this creepy midi, with a heart beat motif and loads of strange sounds accompanying it. Well, Xenonauts delivered 11 very good tracks made by Aleksi Aubry-Carlson which you can linsten  here [aleksiaubrycarlson.bandcamp.com]. Ground Combat Day 2 is the one I had looked for.All in all I am really happy with my purchase of Xenonauts. It’s a very good take on the classical UFO formula, faithful to the original concept but still bringing its own setting and story that drive you forward to uncover the alien secrets and save the earth once more.

												First off, air combat is great - I mean, finally - this has always been a very important part of these games and it irked me that XCOM 2012 pretty much ignored it.  Here it's way more important, plays better, and has a much better consequence spiral.I wanted to like this game - I have hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in the original X-COM games.  I've finished TFTD on superhuman ironman.  I've played a ballistics only UFO Defense... I even made my way through XCOM Interceptor...<edit>  Before we go any further, I want to add a little edit since many of the comments are critical about how I can thumb down a game even though I have 120 hours into it - The short answer is:  I should really like this game, it seems perfect on paper, but I didn't and I wanted to know _why_.</edit>♥♥♥♥ this game though - and for one simple reason - the Aliens always know where you are.   And this isn't the X-COM: EU type of alien squadsight where if they see one troop, they can see all your troops.   This is where if you are within range of an alien, even one that's never looked outside the UFO, it triggers a special AI.   This is the kind where if you have a wall between you and an alien, the alien will be facing you through the wall.  Remember how in TFTD there would be those little closets where aliens would get stuck because of a pathing bug?  And to kill that last alien you'd have to either eat up its reaction fire with rookies or blow through the walls from another direction?  Well, this is half of the aliens in this game.  And you can't blow through the walls.  UFO breaches, depending on the layout, are either brutal or tedious.   Most of the time the aliens will just sit behind the door in their command center, full TUs, waiting to reaction fire as soon as you make a move.   And that's nothing compared to alien base assaults.Jesus effing Christ - the beginning of the assault are fun - about a third of the aliens on the map will make their way to the LZ and try to push you out.  The next phase is classic XCOM - carefully make your way to the control room, removing opposition as you go.  The last phase is just mind-numbing tedium - 1/3 of the aliens in the base are sitting in a single room, barely moving so they can keep their TU high for reaction fire.  Problem is that there's something like a 60% chance that if they hit your fully armored guys, they will kill you in one hit.  They, on the other hand - take 3-5 hits, on average to take out.  Now, add in the lovely 'Dread' effect and half your team will have 30% of their TUs removed.  Just 'cause.  It's like they combined the worst parts of all the XCOM games - Alien PSI spam, Lobstermen Bullet Sponges, XCOM 2012 projectile/cover dynamics, Apocalypse AI camping - and they put it all into a single room.  Then we can talk about LOS issues - they are everywhere.  The number of times I have gotten shot (or have shot) through a wall is ridiculous.  Or aliens shooting through solid obstacles from the fog of war.  Or sitting in the middle of a roof and having an alien along the wall of the building be able to hit me.  How about trying to throw a grenade over a knee-hgh wall, only to realize that you don't *throw* grenades so much as you fire them in a direct line from your chest.Moving past the map issues, the way ballistics work is just broken.   In the original X-COM, you shoot a bullet, it will fly in a straight line until it hits something (Wall, scenery, alien, back of your team mate's head) or it goes off the map.  It's simple, it worked - your accuracy percentage was your chance to hit a target at 20 tiles, that accuracy determined the size of the cone the bullets leaving your weapon would travel.   The game didn't care what you were shooting at, just put the bullets in that cone and they did what they did - whether it was boring a hole through a house or taking down a floater.  Here, you have a) a chance you'll hit the alien (XCOM 2012) and b) a chance to hit anything in the way. (XCOM 94)  Let's say that you're shooting at an enemy with a LMG.  There's a bale of hay between you and the enemy, but you know that your LMG can shoot down that hay bale if you get 2-3 shots into it.  So, you force target the alien and the first 3 rounds of your 10 round burst do indeed destroy the obstacle between you and the bad guy.  You expect to see the 7 remaining bullets proceed to kill or even just supress the alien on the other side.  Unfortunately, the remaining 7 rounds just *poof* disappear, stopping where the hay bale used to be because that chance to hit an alien is determined before the first shot is made.  That's the XCOM 2012 binary hit / miss calculation ♥♥♥♥ing everything up.  Even if you have a clear path between you and the alien, the bullet will still disappear at the alien's square and you'll get a *miss* text pop up over the alien's head.  It won't continue past them on these occasions, possibly hitting the explosive barrels on the tile directly behind them, just another *poof*.  That game said you had 95% chance to hit that alien, and even if your bullet had perfect dead-center trajectory, that 5% will kick in and eat that bullet.Oh, and sidenote - dread is the worst game mechanic ever introduced.

												This is a solid strategic game.  Sure, it doesn't have the eye-popping 3D graphics of the current XCom games, but what it's lacking there it more than makes up for in challenging gameplay.  And by challenging, I don't mean aliens picking you apart while you hide in full cover and wonder what the point was.  The aliens here will find ways to flank you with the same type units that at other times often would hole up defensively instead.  Sometimes it takes carefully placed explosives / flashbangs / stun gas into an area just to give you a leg up vs. them.  It is also a difficult game to master in terms of having a good gameplan finance-wise.  Will you spend a pile of your initial funding on science research to get a better technological balance vs. your foe, or will build extra hangars to combat the increasing ufo assault?  How much of that funding will go to engineers to help you build better weapons & vehicles quickly enough to be of real use, and how much of it will you spend on soldiers to have enough to stop terror missions while still defending your own base?  Or I should say, 'bases', because one will not be enough, as the threat is ongoing and everywhere.  It's a fine line to walk (and I'm just talking about normal difficulty here).So if you get distracted easily, or you're looking for a lot of gloss and entertaining Wow - factor, this game might not be for you.  If you're into a game that'll hand you your♥♥♥♥♥♥the first few times you play it and demand that you improve your strategy, well then you've come to the right place. :)			"

												I think that one of the best ways to define Xenonauts is as a ""spiritual remake"" of X-Com: UFO Defense. By that I mean that the developers attempted to recreate the original X-Com as faithfully as possible (while at the same time improving on the classic's flaws) but had to use a different setting, considering they don't own the rights to the X-Com franchise (hence the ""spiritual"" aspect). What is the result of said remake? Simply put, the best X-Com game that I have ever played. Xenonauts succeeds admirably at perfecting the formula that made the original game a timeless classic, and while it does have a few flaws, it is nonetheless a fantastic turn-based strategy game. It also brings forth a very nice artistic design, and streamlines the original's cumbersome UI, thus successfully bringing the original concept into the modern era of gaming.In Xenonauts, you act as the commander of the titular organization tasked with defending the Earth against an alien invasion set in a Cold War-era setting. The game is divided into three separate components: a real-time administration simulation with 4X and sandbox elements where you manage the bases of your organization (assigning all kinds of tasks such as research, manufacturing of equipment, and building of annexes) and monitor for UFO activity in a map of Earth; a real-time with pause minigame where you engage UFOs with your interceptor aircraft; and a turn-based strategy component where the actual combat against the aliens happens. This last mode is where the meat of every X-Com game lays, and in the case of Xenonauts, I'm happy to state that said combat missions are every bit as challenging, tense and satisfactory as they were in X-Com: UFO Defense. Furthermore, the turn-based combat has been largely improved from the original, featuring more deep, complex mechanics, a wider array of weaponry and artifacts, and a healthy dose of streamlining where it was needed. You have to keep in mind that this is a very challenging and difficult game. Every choice you make has consequences, and actions are irreversible. Furthermore, if you play on Ironman (a mode which I recommend activating from your very first playthrough, as these kind of games are clearly designed to work that way) you will not be able to reverse to a previous save state. You'll have to learn to go on with your choices, both good and bad, and I can't emphasize how fulfilling it is to achieve victory in these conditions. Remember though that if one of your soldiers dies, they're gone. Forever.A rather notorious addition that Xenonauts made to the X-Com formula is the air combat. As I mentioned earlier, this is a real-time with pause minigame where you direct your aircraft against the UFOs in a radar-like interface, trying to maximize the damage you deal to them while avoiding their deadly attacks as much as possible. While I think this mode is far from perfect, as many times I felt it was a bit shallow, it is nonetheless a huge leap from UFO Defense's barebones interception system, and I think it succeeds in getting the job done.The only real complaint I have with Xenonauts is with the way that psionic attacks works. This was a huge flaw in the original X-Com, as psionic abilities were hugely overpowered. In Xenonauts, they tried to fix this by making psionics unavailable to humans and making it a bit less powerful in aliens. Unfortunately, the result is that many times you feel completely powerless against psionic attacks, as there's no research that allows to counter it (something like the Mind Shields in XCOM: Enemy Unknown would have helped a lot in making it a fairer mechanic). Still, it's not a game breaking flaw, and the game it's still an excellent one even with the annoyance it poses.At the end of the day, I don't see any reason not to recommend this game to everyone interested in a deep, complex, and tactical experience. For classic X-Com fans, this is a no-brainer, and for newcomers the lower difficulties are forgiving enough to make learning the basics of the game a smooth experience (keep Ironman mode activated though, that's the way to play this, in my opinion). Go for it.			"

												I am pleasantly surprised.The original X-Com was best known for its punishing difficulty.  But it was also known, among people who played it much, for its annoying idiosyncracies and irritations.  Xenonauts does away with many of these, simplifying things while keeping much of the difficulty.  For example, you can define soldier classes that have no game effect, but allow you to set default equipment.  Standard-issue gear costs nothing and takes up no space, because a base commander has better things to do than count rifle clips.  Base defenses are automatically upgraded, because really, who wants to rebuild base components every time you research a new tech?Some things are harder: The tech tree seems to keep things a little more out of reach, and funding is absolutely brutal.  Some things are easier: Riot shields.  Oh my God, riot shields.  Instead of ablative rookie shields, lead your squad with a guy with a shield and a pistol.  Why the hell didn't we have these in the original X-Com.  It feels so good (and it won't help at all when a Chryssalid, or whatever they call them in Xenonauts, comes knocking).  Also, if you crash an interceptor, your engineers will recover it and put it back together in a week or so.  Losing an expensive ship near the beginning of the game is no longer painful enough to make you want to start over.A personal favorite feature of mine is airstrikes.  Are there four small crashed UFOs on the map at once?  Do you need cash?  Do you cringe at the thought of playing them all out?  Just hit the airstrike button and the local military will blow it away, recover the scrap, and pay you for your donation...less than you'd get from a raid, but well worth the savings of player time.  Also, intercepting alien ships is pretty rad.  New dimension that X-Com never had, and it might not be your thing; you order your planes around in realtime, outflanking and gunning down the enemy with nifty fields of fire.  Personally I could take it or leave it, but there's an autoresolve button, and since you can recover crashed ships it won't instantly♥♥♥♥♥♥you over!If you've ever heard me complain about Galactic Civilizations II, you know I hate bad humor, especially in tech trees.  I know...I'm weirdly specific that way.  Well, your lead scientist in Xenonauts has an irritating intellectual superiority complex, but it's written *just right*, enough that you get a wonderful, subtle characterization just from the tech reports, no cutscenes required.  You want to deck him in the face, not turn him off entirely.  Well done, Goldhawk.Anyway, I've played to the point where I'm through the first terror mission, and I gotta say there's a huge difficulty spike.  Just as it should be.  If you think the first month is too easy, take another look at your funding, and wait for some pain to roll into tactical.  As a big fan of the original X-Com, I heartily endorse this game: Cleaning up all the annoyances and adding a few new features has truly made it new again.  It's the game we loved, without the trappings of retro.  Clear your calendar.			"

												X-Com not X-Commy enough for you?We're going back to our roots here. No fancy 3d graphics hogging your resources. Ain't no voice actors here, just 100% pure, uncut, grade A tactile turn based combat. Hire people based off stats, Assign them based off stats. Equip them with stolen alien tech to improve their stats. Build up your base to increase stats. Stats everywhere. I really like how when you're inching a dude forward and then set him in prone, you can move him again if another guy uncovers an alien that suddenly has him vulnerable if he has enough points left, all in the same turn. Their system really helps make the combat feel forgiving while remaining engaging and fun. You can afford to take some risks which makes the combat feel faster and more fluent then typical tactical turn based games.There isn't really a whole lot to say here, you know the formula and these guys executed it well. Great combat, music and graphics... just an all around stellar title. Be sure to pick this one up.			"

								The real alternative for everybody, who thought the X-COM remake from Firaxis was not close enough to the original.While also in an alternate reality (the X-COM scenario was always a bit in the future), this game starts in the late seventies of the last century. The technology involves the guns from that time (first iterations of the M16 and similar weapons) to begin with, but in true X-COM fashion, these will soon be replaced with the technology from the enemy.Base building (multiple bases on the planet are a necessity in order to win), soldier management, loadout customization, UFO tracking and intercepting, all that works very similarly to the original X-COM and is not streamlined for the ""newer generation of gaming"" (whatever that means...). We have UFO recovery missions, base assault missions (both offensive and defensive) and terror site missions. There is no story missions or such, which take you by your hand, you have to make your own story.The missions play in a traditional round-based system with actionspoints. When actionpoints are not used up in a round, the soldier can have an interrupt chance and fire back at the enemy (same rule applies for the aliens, so watch it when opening the door of a UFO).On the negative side, there is not really any sort of tutorial. However, with the newest patch a lot of tooltips have been introduced which explain the game rules, but I can see that this could be a bit tedious for a new player. Also, the graphics might not be everybody's cup of tea (check some screenshots to see what I mean).All in all, I can highly recommend this. While not released yet (still beta), the release is just around the corner and there are a couple of bugs left to be squashed. But it is highly playable. Just the ironman mode is a bit of a gamble, since there is no guarantee, that the save game does not get corrupted.			"

								Xenonauts is a UFO:EU-inspired turn-based tactical strategy game set during the Cold War. The game begins in 1979, when the player is tasked with leading a joint NATO/USSR task force formed in response to a mysterious alien threat. The player is responsible for managing every level of the organization, from constructing bases and researching new technology, to deploying and commanding fighters, to directing individual soldiers on the battlefield in turn-based combat.Aesthetically, the game has a unique, classy visual identity, great sound design, and a superb soundtrack.Gameplay-wise, the game is of course similar to its inspiration, X-COM (or UFO: Enemy Unknown), but with rebalanced combat, a vastly superior interface, added mechanics (such as suppression), and real-time air combat. If you're a new player who was at some point intimidated by the original X-COM's initial lack of direction and micromanagement, or a fan of Firaxis' XCOM looking for a different experience, definitely give Xenonauts a try. It has all the depth and fun of the original X-COM but with almost all of the micromanagement stripped out and a clearer, more presentable interface.If you're a UFO:EU vet, you'll find something new here. For instance, unlike in UFO, combat armor is extremely valuable, but also heavy, so if you want to follow the tried and true strategy of blowing everything up with C4 you'll have to pay for it in either survivability or mobility. Running out of ammunition can be a very real concern. Suppression and improved alien AI moves the gameplay away from massed reaction fire toward more dynamic ""fire and maneuver""-style gameplay.The best thing about Xenonauts is its ability to remain ""faithful"" to UFO:EU without feeling like a nostalgia-driven fan remake of an older game. Xenonauts is not afraid to make changes to the formula if they benefit the overall game, nor is it trying to ""recapture"" the greatness of its idol. Xenonauts wants to forge its own identity as a bleak, uncompromising, tense, occasionally terrifying strategy game. And it largely succeeds.Very much recommended.			"

Posted: December 14, 2016
												I wanted to like this game so bad, I tried so hard to like it... but after about 15 hours vanilla and 15 hours modded, I just can't recommend it. I can break this game down into a few components and I'll review them individually - let's start with the good: Air Battles: I absolutely adore the air battles in this game. The geoscape is a flat map, UFOs pop up, and you send out your aircraft. When you hit them, you get to know exactly what they are and can choose to retreat, tail them to get a better engagement positiion, or just go in for the kill. What follows is a fast-pased ""real-time"" (though pausible) battle between your jets and the enemy aircraft. Depending on your armement and the foe, these can be breeze or a complete nightmare. Shooting down UFOs over land gives you the option to simply annihilate the remains for money, or go in to attempt to capture resources. Base Management: Base management is also great! You do the thing, build the rooms. Manage the number of people your base can provide for, the ratio of scientists to engineers to soldiers. Keep enough medbays for sick fellows, hangars for your planes, garages for your vehicles. If aliens get to your base (and they will), the battle will take place in your base, as you designed it. But that's not the end of it, because you don't get just one base, you get as many as you please! Each one with it's own radar range, vehicles, squads, researchers. Graphics: And here we go. I know this may be vein, but I think it's important - Xenonauts lacks absolutely any semblence of luster. It is the most God-damn dreary, drab, boring, plain graphics I have seen. The original X-Com was more colorful, Gameboy games used better palettes, and it can't dare to compete to anything with a budget (ala XCom 2012). I feel absolutely fine playing old games with crappy graphics, but there's no life in Xenonauts. Everything but fire and smoke are perfectly still when you're thinking. There are no idle animations, in fact there are almost no animations at all! Shooting isn't satisfying - just lift the gun and a gentle ""pew pew"". Threw a grenade? ""Poof"" and it's over. This game feels like it was drawn up by an insurance salesman. It's completely lifeless and boring, it feels like a placeholder.This complaint isn't even superficial, it actually impacts gameplay. Handling the different vertical layers is painful at best, you'll lose enemies because their colors are exactly the same as the environment they're standing in!  Ground Combat: But it gets worse. The ground combat is just  DREADFUL . Watch as you:* Throw a grenade and have it fall to the feet of your soldier, killing him and perhaps another squady. * Struggle to work with the LoS cover mechanics - the enemy shoots you, you can't shoot back, you move out from cover, they take a reaction shot (we'll get to that later), you shoot (and miss), and then step back into cover. There's no peek mechanic. The awkward camera and bad visuals just make this even worse. There's so little feedback ever given to you on what you can expect and the feedback you do get straight-up  lies . And don't forget, and I'm not joking, the aliens can shoot through the hulls of their ships. You read that correctly, they shoot through the hulls that you can't so much as see through because the engine can't handle their circular shape. * Not take reaction shots, - seriously, who thought of this? In the original X-Com, units would consistently take reaction shots if they had enough TU. In the new XCOM, overwatch just  works . Reaction fire in this game is a delve into madness! A team with 100% TU will just completely ignore an enemy reaper walk up and murder them.  It's completely RNG, yet the aliens take them almost every time you move! * Have soldiers panicking or unnerve every turn, losing half or more of their TU. Fine. Workable. But then you get worthless mechanics like ""berserk"" - which have your unit turn to their nearest ally and blow out their brains. This isn't a psi attack, it's a game mechanic. Fans of the game counter this by, and I kid you not, always holding their weapons in the backpack - taking them out each individual use.* Just die. Not because you made a bad decision, not because your weren't equipped, not because of clever AI, and not in a way you can learn from, but just because. They shoot through their ship walls, they shoot through cover you can't even see around, they toss grenades before they get any form of LoS. Your soldiers kill each other, your soldiers kill themselves. Opened a door, eat shrapnel. No one takes reactions shots, reaper squad kills them all. Rockets and grenades blow up at you or the flanking squad's feet. Dying is good, it makes you learn and gives your decisions meaning and consequence. But you don't die in this game, you just stop living for no reason at all. Despite all this, though, I still want to love it. I'll come back to it from time to time; and I'll update my review as I see fit.			"

If you enjoyed any of the original XCOM series of games and even the newer Enemy Unknown/Within games, and have put this off because it looks or sounds like a tacky greenlight clone (like i have) you are doing yourself a great disservice. It's worth the 20something quid, goldhawk did a fantastic job on this game and it needs to be played to be believed. Do it.  "

												Play it on Normal + Ironman, read a couple of guides, accept that you'll lose a couple times before you put a solid run together, and Xenonauts will stand up as one of the best strategy games you've ever played. More than anything it's the way that Xenonauts keeps tireless pace with me -- I might get an economic or technological edge, only to have my veteran soldiers wiped out by a new enemy type or a bad decision. I adore XCOM -- it's probably my favorite game of the past five years -- but Xenonauts is deeper, tougher, more personal, more detailed, more PC, and a better strategy game if you play it with a bit of patience.

												This is as close to a completly faithful remake of XCOM that we're ever going to get. And boy, is it faithful. It even adds a few new things, like a dogfighting minigame that's leagues better from we had in either the old XCOM or the remake.Combat is nice in balanced, and my only real nitpicks are that grenades are overpowered and clearing ships is a meatgrinder, since unless you outright destroy the door, UFO entrances will close every round, forcing you to play whack-a-mole. If you ever played UFO Defense, or even just Enemy Unknown, you owe it to yourself to buy this and give it a whirl. I give it a hearty recommendation to anyone.			"

												Xenonauts is amazing! If u're a fan of the original XCOM or even the XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within, then u'll love this one. Especially if u're looking for more of a challenge compared to XEU. Xenonauts definitely offers the player more control over what/how u can spend and allocate your funds, as well as more randomness in terms of ground combat and enemy placement.If I had to pick a negative, I would say that the game doesn't necessarily have a random map generator like the original XCOM did/does. Xenonauts has more of a semi random map generator, in which u may come across a similar map, but the layout in terms of what's on the map may be different. For example; instead of a crate being placed in a particular part of the map, there may be a set of parked cars or debris of some kind etc. Of course in the forums, u can always download custom maps ppl design, and add em to ur game to spice it up, and keep the game fresh as well. I would imagine (if they hadn't already or are already in talks) they would possibly put up a patch as far as implementing a random map generator.Other than that, the game is absolutely Amazing!!! I still haven't even seen all the maps nor all the enemies as well. If I were to pick a number, I would definitely give this game a 9/10, 4/5, B+/A u name it..			"

												If you love the original XCOM games. Get Xenonauts. It's as close as it gets to the original but with many many improvents regarding gameplay and manegement. It also adds tactical interceptions which are quite challenging. XCOM: Enemy Unknown wasn't a bad game, but Xenonauts is much better if you really want to sink your teeth into a strategy game.The graphics are... well... functional and they look nice, but do not expect flashy 3D extravaganzas. I am glad I bought this early on...although its not finished I still enjoyed hours of gameplay.Added after final relase:I currently can't recommend this game. There are some weird glitches going on. First of all I have had several crashes midmission. This is no fun if you don't save every minute and there is no quicksave feature. (so you have to go to the menu and save manually). /Added: This seems to be fixedSecond of all...the cover system is weird. If you kneel behind a wall that looks like 3 feet high it often said it I had a 45% chance that my shot gets blocked by said wall. IRL I would put the gunbarrel on top of the wall. Aliens shoot at me but it says 100% blocked when I want to shoot back. That feels wrong. Cover and blocking are really unintuitive and glitchy.Third of all...the FOV for your soldiers is like 45 degrees on each side. What are my soldiers...moles? But having an alien 60 degrees to the left and just 5 squares away and I cant see him? What about peripheral vision. That alien stood there without cover.I was kind of ignoring these issues in early access but as a finished product I can't. I was so looking forward to play this game proper but it was just aggravating. I understand that its hard, that aliens can look and shoot better but feeling like commanding a troop of myopic idiots is'nt fun.For a little 90sec demonstration:

												This is the only faithful remake of the original 1994 game UFO: Enemy Unknown (aka X-COM: UFO Defense). It has numerous flaws, but in the end it captures enough of the original X-COM magic to be well worth playing. (The recent Firaxis game, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, is an excellent game in its own right, and probably a better game, but is not faithful to the original X-COM formula.)The game improves on the original X-COM in several ways. It helps reduce end-game grind by allowing you to skip the ground combat after shooting down a UFO, in exchange for greatly reduced rewards. It eliminates the X-COM problem of having to laboriously track down the final alien. It updates the interface to more modern standards of user-friendliness. It adds a proper cover system (albeit a frustratingly bad one). It adds an air combat mini-game to make shooting down UFOs more interesting. And, it adds some mod support to the game. Soldier advancement is pretty well-designed too, allowing rookies to get better without you having to force them into dangerous situations so they can get kills, although I think the original X-COM was okay in this respect.Unfortunately, the flaws are many.The AI is quite stupid. Aliens (and civilians) often run around in circles, or run back and forth through a fire until they die. Your squadmates don't seem to care about friendly fire during reaction fire, so if they have a 25% chance of hitting an alien and a 65% chance of hitting a teammate, they'll still take the shot. You want to keep your machine-gunners behind you because they're not very flexible, but then you have to worry about them slaughtering a team member if they decide to do reaction fire. Or, you want your infantry to advance behind a tank for cover, but they might shoot and blow up the tank trying to hit an alien on the other side. And there's no way to disable reaction fire to avoid this.The cover system appears nice at first, but it's quite bad. It's just nonsensical what kind of objects can block your shot or grenade. If you're next to a tall box, and on the other side of the tall box is a short box, you can shoot over the tall box but the short box will block your shot even though that's impossible. Etc.There are unforgiveable flaws in the game simulation. If you know an alien is on the other side of a flimsy fence, you might think ""time to blast through it with my machine-gunner"", but no. The first bullet may destroy the fence, and the other nine bullets will just hit the empty space where the fence used to be. This makes machine-gunners far less useful, since they can't punch through obstructions to hit enemies behind. Also, there's no gravity. A favorite tactic of mine in the original X-COM was to get the drop on enemies by blasting a hole in the ceiling and dropping in on them. In Xenonauts, you can make a hole, but you won't fall through. Even with a big hole, you can just walk around in the air where the floor used to be. (Similarly, if you kill a flying enemy, its corpse will just float in the air.)Other, less important omissions from the simulation that existed in the original X-COM: no negative effects from smoke inhalation, temporary unconsciousness, etc. Also, sometimes in Xenonauts, you can see through walls. So presumably the aliens can see you through walls.The maps are small, few, and not randomized, unlike the original X-COM which had random maps. You'll see repeat maps pretty often by the end of the game. The ground is entirely flat, unlike the original X-COM which had hills and whatnot. The alien ships are linear and thus safer to assault compared to the original X-COM ships which could be quite treacherous.The game fails to capture the tension and fear from the original X-COM, at least for me. When you start the original X-COM, you have 14 men (with the least-upgraded transport ship). Before you even exit the transport ship, plasma bolts start flying your way. You can't even see who's shooting at you. Your men are dying. You're diving for cover, or trying to. The aliens are blasting your cover apart. Gotta find new cover. Shoot back, or keep moving?? Finally, you get to a good spot or kill the immediate attackers. Three men are dead, and two are wounded. And now you can start trying to complete the mission... The aliens in the original X-COM are dangerous. They can see further than you, their weapons are devastating, and they frequently ambush you. In Xenonauts, I never really felt threatened in the same way. The aliens aren't very aggressive, they can't see further than you, and there isn't as big of a difference in weapons. You never have to fight in the dark, and almost never in buildings. You can fight every mission in daylight. As a result, it's easier than X-COM and it doesn't feel as satisfying to turn the tide of the war because you don't start so far behind. That said, there's an iron-man mode, which should help add some of the missing tension back into the game.Alien psionics are devastatingly random. There is no way to effectively defend yourself against them. No matter how strong-willed your men are, no matter how high their morale, health, etc., they will frequently be mind-controlled or worse. Combined with the fact that psionics don't require line of sight, it's just frustrating rather than fun, especially if you want to play iron-man and can't reload the game.The game lags even on a modern system sometimes. For instance, after I added a hovertank to my team the game started lagging pretty noticeably.The developers seem a bit incompetent. When flaws like those mentioned above were pointed out (e.g. why the cover system was so bad), they said they couldn't fix them because ""it's too hard"". X-COM did many of these things better in 1994, and many other games do them better today, so I think if it's too hard it's because the developers aren't good enough at their jobs. (Also, I've been programming for decades so I know something about what things should and shouldn't be hard to do.)In addition, there are numerous small bugs, but they're not too annoying and at least the game seems stable. It has never crashed for me.In spite of all those problems, if you're a fan of the original X-COM, I believe you'll enjoy this game.			"

												THIS IS IT!This is new version of old classic XCOM serie.Is this as good as original? It's even better. And I know what I am saying - I'm a big fan of original game.Developers just took classic game and developed it again trying to improve every aspect. And they achieved their goal.It's still complex and complicated game but some aspects are wisely simplified.Game feels very finished but developers still work on that title - BRAVO.VERDICT:If you're fan of original XCOM, you must try this, you will probably love it.If you are a fan of new XCOM version, you should also try it. There is huge chance you will like this game too.If you are just a fan of good games, you should try this one, because it's just great game.But if you are fan of modern super graphics ultra simplified 3D games, don't try this.

												In short: Game is excellent, it has it's flaws and other small things, but in overall, a worthy reboot of UFO: Enemy Unknown (X-COM: UFO Defense in NA). You must buy it if you enjoyed UFO back in the days.Pros.:+ lives up to any UFO: Enemy Unknown lover's expectations+ scary musics which gives a good vibe on the battlefield+ you can take control of an air battle, meaning you control your jets against the alien ships+ easy to learn the ropes of the game+ ability to airstrike a crashsite, which can give you some easy cashCons.:- sometimes the game can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ i.e. early invasions of Androns- the RNG is too strong sometimes, so you need to plan ahead if you want to surviveI hope that the devs will consider making the reboot of X-COM: Terror From The Deep.

												The best bit about xenonauts is that it is an awesome port of a classic game with updated graphics and a few cool new ideas and changes.The worst bit about xenonauts is that it is an awesome port of a classic game that was not implemented fully. So much of this game is half way done and not fleshed out fully.Let me explain.It's prettier than original x-com... if by prettier you mean higher resolution. There is no way to rotate the map, no way to zoom the map in or out (well... you can change the resolution i guess), no minimap, fences and doors obscure everything behind them unless there is a npc or player model on that square... the list goes on.The geoscape is a mess. It's a flat projection of the world that takes as long to travel around the pole as it does at the equator and radar ranges are perfect circles. This would not be a problem except someone decided to be clever and program in a realistic day/night transition that even moves up and down with the seasons. It's not game breaking, gameplay is balanced around the flat map and perfect circles...Yet I can not get over the realistic day night line. If you're going to do one bit right, you have to do all the bits right, not half of it.You can set things on fire! But there is no incendiary ammo, and things you would expect to burn (hay bales, wooden buildings) don't. Once again, it's a lovely mechanic ripped form original x-com that is implemented half way.This basically applies to every single item in the game. Research, manufacturing, base development, combat, tooltips, in game information, etc.I'm enjoying playing this game... in short stints. If I play too long the flaws grate too much and I get frustrated with the game instead of enjoying it.If you can overlook/don't notice the flaws xenonauts is a solid x-com remake and is be a lot of fun.

												Xenonauts is a great game.Once I shot down a main craft over at snowy I suppose planes of Greenland. Just a routine intercept, kill those alien sum♥♥♥♥♥es, get that much needed dosh so I could build another base and name it something from Secret Warriors. Or so I thought.My brave men and women including Iosif Nichayko, Ellen Ripley, Rick Deckard and my main killing mean machine lieutenant John Cross who rocked cool moustache, Wolf armor, a riot shield and a plasma pistol were all there.My prised bull Iosif who was always clearing the UFO itself with a shotgun got shot almost immediately by a crased Icelandic reseacher who mistook our dropship for some sort of huge alien spacecraft. My brave men and women couldn't retaliate and thus commit a horrible war crime of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a cold dead body of an Icelandic meteorologist because said meteorologist was shot by his pal, another reseacher present on this snowy research station. The man nodded and moved on completely dissappearing from the point of view of my brave men and women.The research station itself was swarming with reapers, disgusting aliens who turn men into zombies and ♥♥♥♥ corpses. They weren't such a huge problem for mymen since my APC made a quick work of them.We finally made it to the alien aircraft. It was on fire, dying moans and swearing in some beastly alien language were heard from inside. We sweeped the first hall, nothing but reptiloid bodies and blood. ANd in the second hall we found the same honorable Icelandic scientist executing sebilian officer.He then slowly walked into the flame and dissappeared again.The mission was a success. "

												I had bought this game in early access, when Greece was still located in Europe(and not in the Middle East) because I wanted to support the developers and help them finish what seemed like a game with amazing potential.After that, I followed the development at the forums, I saw all good things about the game being ""watered down"". I saw absurd concepts like ""indestructible interceptors"" being divined and adopted by the developers, despite of the abundance of *much better* ideas and propositions by the community in order to achieve the balance desired, without destroying immersion.I saw the developers insisting that, after >4 years in development, the trajectory of grenades is not weird to be the same as projectiles(and be stopped on 60 cm walls or on a soldier just in front of you), because ""it is not easy to program"" :o.I heard the most absurd excuses about why random maps ""are impossible to implement"", while the original X-COM had them so many years ago(one of them was ""the better graphics"" in this game :o ).I witnessed the arrogance of the developers(threatening their early access clients with banishment from the forums because they did not agree with the turn the game was taking, disrespectful to straightforward insulting replies to criticism and more) and their complete indifference and disrespect to the type of game they were creating.I was given as excuse for the placement of Greece with the middle east as being ""difficult for the game code to handle it being with Europe, because there was no land connection"". It does not seem that Scandinavia has such a problem, though, despite not being connected by land to the rest of Europe(or, should I say, Western Europe, since they peculiarly decided to pick the cold war era for their game?).Realism and consistence with the time period set up was an excuse(whenever they bothered giving one) for the things people did not like as they were holding down game experience, but was never an issue when the decision was facilitating the ""development"" of the game.The game was getting progressively worst, cool features removed, flat progression inserted, the development team was obvious that they did not care at all. All they wanted was to be done with it. Believe it or not, 1 1/2 year ago, the Goldhawk owner was asking for coders for another project since ""Xenonauts was at the verge of completion"" and wanted to share the resources with other projects for cost efficiency!!This is the history of the making of the game as I witnessed it. Result?A Broken Game!The game is aspiring to have all cool features from X-COM, Jagged Alliance and various other great games of the past combined, but it fails in all accounts due to the laziness of the developers, the inexistent game design and the ridiculously high amount of bugs in the game.This game has the most historically and topographically unrealistic ""realistic strategic setup"" ever made in a strategy game.This game has the most lame balance ever in a strategy game I have ever played.I feel I was cheated by Goldhawk and I can say for certain that I will *never* buy or recommend a title produced by this laughable excuse of a company and they are the reason I will never again buy an Early access game again.I hope that this review will save some X-COM fans from throwing away their money, because the positive reviews of this game are greatly deceiving and misleading to anyone that reads them.

												Xenonauts is all about patience. For my first hundred of hours I was just learning the ropes here... and I have nothing to say against the accusations for this game being too unfair and too repetative.Firaxis XCom with LongWar? Pff! In Xenonauts, every session is longer. It usually takes more than 150-200 ground battles in one game, (almost) no matter the difficulty level. And yeah, the variety of elements for scenery is quite low, so, while there will not be exactly the same maps - after you've play 2-3 battles on the each continent, you may pretend you've seen them all.Now, the difficulty. It feels just as in the Civilization games on the highest levels. The enemies will be doing same things way better. Progress speed, amount of units, their stats - especially accuracy - all this is certainly and clearly NOT balanced fairly.So, before any other notes, I felt I should tell you about it. You'll fall alot there. The price of every mistake is very high, yet quite often there is no other way than sacrifice some to save at least something. It hurts, but it's a war.As of the game in general, it has many downsides, and the worst of it, you can get tired in no time. Deficit-ridden budget, lame weaponry, weak recruits, freakingly low speed progress - the world is going into abyss, and it seems there's nothing you can do about it. It's that kind of tireness when you're getting discouraged and lay your hands down.So, to actually play this game, to like it at some level, you gotta be one of those stubborn people who don't know how to give up. And... read manual, it really helps!For instance, when I've found that I can form the wings of my fighters rather than send them one by one - it was so huge leap forward, that it raised up the torch of my fading interest, and I finally made it behind the first half of the game, onto Corvettes and some other serious shift.Does it feels like the old-good XCOM? More or less. The global map and strategy elements are certainly parsecs ahead of that Firaxis botchery. The air battles are almost just as good as old series... even if bugged sometimes, so ""autoresolve"" remains the best option. The ground fights, however... are certainly lacking something. If you're a deep fan of the XCom Enemy Unknown, and not the squad-sized TBS in general - you'll certainly be disappointed. Shootouts there are ten times less fascinating. You'll moving much more than shooting - only by maneuvers you'll have the possibility to even to odds. As aliens there are always the defending party - they'll know from where you're coming, they're already aimed and covered from the start. Good thing is that you can create routes, by blasting through walls, and other obstacles...Well, there are too much to say, and little space to do so. Let's summarize.Am I recommending the Xenonauts? Yes. But, there are many chances you'll not like it EVEN if you like the squad-based tactical games in general. It's not ""the way to banish boredom"", but a big, unfair challenge to save the world from killing squatting space invaders. Prepare for the worst, but try to win!As of usual marks, I'll say, 7.8/10 at current state. Would give it more, would there be less engine crushes, or more realistic background details.			"

												As a die-hard old strategy XCOM fan, I was impressed with this game. It brought all good memories and got me playing this game until the very end (not a lot of games kept my attention during last few years). In this state, I would give this game 9/10 points, as it ""can"" get better with bug-fixes and further development.			"

Truly great tactical turn-based game. Clearly a must-have if you're a fan of the genre!Similar to: X-Com series, Jagged Alliance series, Door Kickers, Fallout Tactics, UFO series, Deadline, Breach & Clear, Arma Tactics, and more.Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com series and it does that very well. Very challenging game where you often need to truly be tactical in order to succeed.What's the game about?Aliens are invading and only You can defend us!.. well, something like that.What makes it a challenging game?It's incredibly easy to die, especially in the early game and you have to be careful, tactical, in order for your soldiers to survive. Don't let anyone go alone, don't rush in without cover, don't be stupid.This YouTube video has some nice tips if you need help getting started, I think that he explained things briefly but thoroughly :)

												I have always said the old Microprose X-COM UFO Defense is one of the greatest games of all time. I had started to worry i was just being nostalgic about an old MS-DOS game, but Xenonaughts cured me of that concern by being objectively and subjectively superior to the old X-COM game. I now know that my feelings about X-COM UFO Defense are genuine and that Xenonaughts has surpassed it.Excellent game, maximum recommedation for anyone who likes tactical turn-based games, and a strong recommendation for everyone else.

Early Access Review
								Did you love X-Com: UFO Defense? Do you wish X-Com: Enemy Unknown was more like UFO Defense? Xenonauts does a great job of capturing what we all loved about UFO Defense and TFTD, but like every UFO Defense clone it has missed the mark a little on atmosphere and setting. The visuals aren't quite as charming as the original, but Xenonauts is definitely top dog if you want a modern UFO Defense and blows its competitors out of the water.Edit: After the feature-complete release of version 1.0, I can safely say that this is the best X-Com UFO Defense clone on the market and can not be missed if you are a fan of UFO Defense or the genre as a whole. A must buy. This review originally had suggestions for other games to check out, but I've removed them as this is the clear Alpha Dog now - I would even be tempted to suggest this over UFO Defense itself to someone who has never played either.

												Xenonauts is an alien fighting game where you play the CEO of an organisation outside of any secret intelligences the earth posses. You have been assigned to fight the impending invasion. You'll start off with ordinary weapons and aircraft, your only advantage is the planets atmosphere and the manoverability of your aircraft -- the aliens haven’t quite developed their ships to handle these conditions... yet.You'll manage a handful of scientists and engineers as well as an army of special forces. Bring down the ships, salvage the resources and research new technologies. Capture and interrogate the aliens to work out their motive. Stop the invasion!Xenonaughts is a top down strategy based game with a dynamic storyline; expect to do quite a bit of reading as the game progresses and you discover more about the alien technologies and the invasion in general.This game is not for people looking for something mindlessly fun and quick to play. You will need to contribute many hours into Xenonaughts to experience its full potential. It's a 'seriously-fun' game for people who love strategy and get a kick out of having full control of everything. "

												Xenonauts is a quite fun turn-based strategy, closely similar to XCOM.++The A.I. is very smart on higer difficulties.++Nice 2.5D eye-pleasing graphics.++Absolutely no P2W.+Detailed air combat: Control your planes. Ability to disallow use of certain weapons, too.+Excellent cover system, akin to XCOM.+It's the Cold War: You won't have advanced weapons. This is true in Xenonauts, as you start with quite weak 1960's era weapons.+Weapon technology: Once you get more advanced, you get better weapons.+Amazing autopsy system: You can see the insides of every alien, robot and organic, and even study them.+Amazing research trees. In-depth research trees with about 100 projects to research.+True-to-the biome maps: Artic tileset on Artic biomes, Desert tileset on Desert biomes, etc.+Cold War airplanes, and more: As you get more advanced, your planes get more advanced, too.+/-The A.I. is quite dumb on Easy-Normal difficulty.-Sometimes-dumb plane AI. I had a plane circle a Corvette, not firing its' torpedos.-Crashes: The game will sometimes crash when you start a mission.Conclusion: This is my first detailed review, and I hope it's good. I cannot give enough praise for this game: it is absolutely brilliant. In my opinion, it is DEFINENTALLY worth the 24.99$.Final Rating: 9.8/10.Edit: grammarfix			"

Posted: June 20, 2014
												A few scattered ideas to sum up my dissapointment, what's not mentioned here is probably good in the game, but not enough to recommend it:GameplayThe ground combat really kills it.Seriously, the line of sight/fire issues are horrible. I like playing games like this without saving (I did so with JA2) but here, to me, it seems impossible. It's just not intuitive. If I have a soldier crouch in the center on a warehouse rooftop, he shouldn't be able to get shot by someone hugging the warehouse wall. Or all the times I've moved a heavy for a slightly better position, only to be informed I now have 0% chance to hit, or something silly like a windowpane blocking 50% of my shots and not enough TUs to get back to my original position and fire. Also, I think the entire MG spray hit chance is calculated when you fire, because I've tried firing through those silly waist high walls with screens on them that you get in UFOs, which give you 0% chance to hit your target, because I figured ok, 1 round blows them away and the rest spray the alien behind... well, no, they all randomly hit the air where the screen used to be. This stuff kind of breaks a tactics game. JA2 didn't have these issues and that was 15 years ago...Also, you can't store extra gear in the dropship. I can't be the only one who used to go back to the ship to get the heavy explosives every now & again in a difficult mission. I miss that.Mission variety:There really isn't any. I know there wasn't that much in the original game either, but if there's one aspect where I think the game could've evolved, it's this one.There was just so much wasted potential here, extraction missions, coming to enforce local forces battle lines (I think they promised a static tank emplacement at one point), pilot rescue missions, I don't know, anything?GraphicsI don't mind the direction they took or the lack of female soldier models or lots of stuff that could've been. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of local forces and civilians and stuff, but the game has next to no animations, the characters don't sway, don't move, they don't anything. Everything is frozen until you take an action and then it's all very mechanical.InterfaceNo option to toggle off centering on selected soldiers starts giving you headaches when you have to move 10 of them through multiple levels like in a UFO or building.You can't reorganize your squad order, which is a mindnumbing oversight. I can't have No. 1 be the shield, 2 & 3 be assault and so on. Was it so hard to let me drag the ground combat squaddie tabs around?I would've preferred scroll up/down to change height levels instead of selected squaddies. I guess tab & tilda work well enough, though. You can change the key bindings but you can't bind them to scroll up/down. I guess you probably can if you  start tinkering with the game files but I shouldn't have to do that.XenopediaI generally love the descriptions in games like this, even Aftermath caught my interest with their alien types and whatever, but here, it feels too... textbook. I read all the entries but they felt dry and the attempts at humor seemed forced. There was 1 funny joke somewhere in there, though.ConclusionIn all, it's a real shame and it taught me a lesson about buying into this kind of stuff. Maybe that gives the pricetag some worth.			"

												It's XCOM+Superior to UFO Extraterrestrials, equal of UFO Alien Invasion, not quite the departure in story and quality that UFO Aftershock was. It does what it promises to do, deliver classic XCOM gameplay without the bugs/DOS limits.True-to-original gameplay with benefits of tech advances and without limitations of 1994 hardware. Artwork isn't pixellated or low-res, but remains 2D. The maps are 2D as well, with some tile/LOS issues, but that is just the flavor of this game. There is no need to specifically select a grenade, move it into the soldier's hand after removing the rifle, then use the nade in combat. Select it from a quick-menu and throw at the enemy. The proper TU cost will be calculated based on where the grenade was in the inventory so it costs the same, just makes gameplay easier. Inventory/equipment can be arranged and saved for future use making it possible to edit existing classes or create your own. Building Missile defences no longer requires you to dismantle outdated facilities to replace with new tech versions. They upgrade automatically when new tech is researched. Saving time and making sense. Xenonauts has many similar improvements over the original XCOM while keeping the gameplay essentially the same.EDITThere are greater departures from the original gameplay. Developers removed the ability for the player to construct manufacturing complexes and use them to create wealth by trading new technology and devices. This was exploited in the original to make funding meaningless. In Xenonauts, your budget is the direct result of your actions in defending funding governments. Let them down enough and your budget will constrict to the point of utter failure. There are no ""points"" you and the aliens score, only collateral damage caused by them and bonuses paid for UFOs shot down. You will sell small amounts of alien item, but it's a pittance compared to the gravy train you could ride in XCOM: UFO Defense. Budgetary restrictions are so severe at higher difficulty levels, that even most grizzled veterans will find it difficult to manage, and will probably lose more than once. Great news if you found all your squad-level tactical games too easy and forgiving.Tactical combat is also extremly dangerous at the highest difficulty level, to the point of it seriously not being worth it just for the sake of leveling soldiers. You will have to fight to collect researchable items or to prevent alien terror, but outside this you will not want to engage in too many battles, certainly not without decent equipment.Air combat is expanded. It takes place in a simplified RTS setting, though it is possible to autoresolve all encounters. You risk taking damage either way. Unlike the classic, aircraft shot down are not lost. In a rare moment of forgiveness, Xenonauts will recover downed aircraft, although it can take 72h to drag the remains back to base.In addition to bringing back classic XCOM gameplay, Xenonauts manages to recreate the addictivness of the original. Your mileage may vary of course, but i personally managed to clock 23h during the first three play sessions. And i found myself thinking about different tactics or wondering how the hell i'm supposed to beat the game at all.			"

Follows the Xcom1 very closelyYes! at last a game that does it right, a worthy succesor to the origional Xcom.Its at least as hard as Xcom1, maybe harderBe warned though, even if your an Xcom pro this game is tough, I'm good at Xcom player but after 4/5 failed attempts at this on ""veteran"" I had to start playing it on ""normal"".It has some differences, but you will be glad.Despite following the origional game closely, for most of its mechanics, Xenonauts does make some minor changes that improve thinngs, stores are less of a chore (many items like ammo and standard wepaons are free and infinite), intercepts are more important and more fun, funding is more important (the old exploits won't work here).Also you will generally have to develop new strategies to win.Obviously the story is different and the techs and the style, but they are all still enthralling and brilliantly done.Just buy this now.Honestly, I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this game... although the head scientist is so obnoxious you will want to punch him, but I think that's deliberate.

												Note: I used to play Xenonauts on my roommate's laptop before I got it for my steam account so my real play time is like 100+ hours I guess.2nd note: Remember to set betas section to ""community edition"", it's the unofficial patch made by the community that was approved by the devs and it makes the game much more fun.3rd note: Mods are awesome, especially X-division (makes basic game feel tremendously easy :P )Have you ever thought that new games are easy and do not require the skills we needed in the past to finish it? That there are too much tips and stuff like quest markers that completely destroy immersion and thus make games feel like Micheal Bay primitive action film? Are you dissatisfied with the new X-COM that made so many simplifications to the genre that it's almost unplayable for fans of good, old UFO?If yes, or partially yes, this is the game for you - search no more! Here you are supposed to be the hunter, but usually feel like a prey.It's not a game that's easy to learn, that you can launch for 30 minutes to ""pew, pew, pew"" some alien scum. It's a game that requires skill and careful planning to dead with obviously superior enemies. There is no absurd mechanics like X-COM aliens that start to act only when you first spot them. Aliens in Xenonauts will use every opportunity to find, shoot and kill you whenever you don't expect it. Even if there is one enemy left on the map you can't behave recklessly cause it will lead your soldiers directly to the gates of Hades. What's more, even when you achieve the most advanced weaponry and armours you will not be safe - your people will still die painfully whenever you make a mistake.I did not manage to finish this game in Ironman mode. Try it if you are hardcore enough. And remeber to train more people than the basic 10. You will need more experienced people cause most of Xenonauts gonna be fried/devoured/melted/shot by berserking friend.This game made me shoot civilians so the aliens could not infestate them and fill their ranks with mutated pawns. It made me put triggered C4 on my soldier who was doing his last stand to buy some time for the rest of the platoon. I desperately used my last unarmed soldier to evacute wounded/dead (you can't be sure till the end of a mission) comrades to evac point under fire like Desmond Doss. My best team that have not suffered a single causalty for over 10 mission got utterly massacred during alien base assault when met the new alien soldiers that fought using tactics and equipment I could have not expected.Do not listen to people who say stuff like ""aliens always know where you are"" in negative comments. With proper tactics you can manuver you opponensts into crossfire and they definitely have not seen that coming. There are some issues of course, like the easy way to fire you rocket over you enemies on ground floor while firing from heigh (one must check if they really aim for the ground level) or glitches like room where you can pass between two sofas and must enter through a window (this one can be causes by 2000+ custom maps I have installed :P). Overall the bugs are minor and do not ruin gameplay.  My final verdict:10/10 - this game is not perfect but the 10 grade is not for perfect products. It's for games that I know I will come back to    after many years have passed. Xenonauts proundly stand among classics like Gothic, first two Fallouts and Total Annihilation. I never expected to say that but both original XCOMs/UFOs should now bow to a new master of the genre - Xenonauts.Now I should go test the first public alpha of Xenonauts 2 ;) Cheers!			"

												This game is the chinese food of strategy. Ugly as hell, it's kinda hard to approach, and if not prepared right it'll make you sick. But a few awkward bites and you'll be scoffing it down.This is basically XCOM but losses feel like your own fault. The tactical depth created by line of sight, orientation, diablo-style inventory, weight and ammo management, and flexible turn-based combat means you'll be spending more time fighting aliens instead of fighting the dice.The campaign is equally deep as the combat. Rather than waiting for aliens to turn up, you must build several bases and actively send aircraft on patrol to areas with UFO sightings. The aircraft have fuel range and ammunition, as well as speed which means they might not always catch up to your target. Even the helicopter that transports your squads has travel time and should be escorted to the crash site in case a UFO shoots it down along with your soldiers.Soldiers don't have XP, but their stats go up depending on what they do. A soldier that carries lots of equipment gains strength stat and can carry even more as a result. This makes soldier rotation extra important, as you can have multiple squads en-route to raid crashed UFOs. Soldiers can be literally any role you want with how the equipment and inventory systems work (my favourite is when a sniper is buff enough to casually carry a spare bazooka. Also try riot shield + 25 grenades in backpack inventory + another 8 grenades on belt inventory. Mix incendiary, frag, smoke, flash and gas grenades for maximum tactic00l flexibility. Heck, you can even have a weaponless soldier who's sole job is to carry spare ammo and rockets).Also appealing is the hardcore Cold War SWAT feeling. Getting hit without armour usually means death, but once you nail the pattern of suppressing fire, flashbangs, and other confined-space-tactics, you'll feel like you're raiding these aliens instead of fending them off.Downsides are the learning curve and functional but slightly ugly graphics.The right way to play this game is with the Community version (opt in through beta). It's been modified and fixed up by players, and includes a bunch of essential mods by default. The map packs will save you from being exposed to the same layout over and over again.			"

												#Early Review - 5 hours in # 12 Missions downXenonauts very much takes after the ORIGINAL XCOM: UFO Defense.  If you like the original XCOM but would like some mod support, the original style of management, and the original game's map and squad size, then this game is likely for you.There are a few cons:- Objects dont seem to become transparent to show (Aliens) behind them. So sometimes you will have someone starring an alien in the eyes and not know about it until they shoot you in the face,- Teammates dont seem to care about shooting other teammates who happen to be in the line of fire. Because those aliens need to die, humanity be damned.- Can be a lot to get used to if you have only played Enemy Unknown/WithinStill early in, so can't speak for length, but so far, I like it a bunch and it is certainly a worthy spiritual successor to the original game.

Is not angerness as in 100% Orange Juice, or when you miss a 99% shoot in the XCOM, or when the AI in the Civ games just declare war on you for no reason.This is Cat Mario type of frustration. The enemies can shoot through 100% cover where you can't. I have been shot thought wall with pistols from totally blind points for the aliens. You get one shoot kill across the map with a shotgun. You get kill by rifle fire from too far away, and again from blind spots for the aliens. I swear some aliens are aimbots inspired from the CS cheaters.The AI is unnecessarily difficult. Is just difficult for the sake of being annoying. And that is just frustrating when you play on Ironman.My feeling is that XCOM:EU was challenging, you can still make no mistake and loose the mission, but you could recover from that. In here you need to make perfect runs, with a cheating AI, and so the game become a matter of luck rather than tactics.There are also minor CTDs, and some annoying interface designs that I don't particularly like.On the bright side, the game actually nails the air combat. You can get your deploy ship shoot down if not withing timing range of your fighters, and so on.			"

												I originally reviewed this game with a 65/100, but I really have to correct myself on this one. The game starts relativerly boring and basic and I based my passed judgement on that, but the game gets a lot better and strategic when you progress further in the game and when you have unlocked a lot of the technology.The ground combat in the beginning is fairly easy and you only have traditional weapons to work with, but as you progress and get better equipment you encounter interesting tactical situations with new opposition where every move counts and any mistake can be a brutal punishment that has a long term effect on your gameplay.What I especially like from this game is the scientific lore. Every new technology you recover and reseach has a very detailed background. And even though fictional the way it is explained sounds credible and makes sense. The devs have really thought about the underlying details of the technology and thats pretty cool.Overall the game has a lot more strategic depth than I originally thought (first few hours of gameplay). And the game mechanics and the AI is a lot better than I originally expected. This is clearly not a game made for the $, but made with passion and devotion... and it shows. 80/100!			"

												This game is a sort of spiritual sequel to the original Xcom games that I think is a bit more faithful to the original then Enemy Unknown and despite the fact that I enjoyed Enemy Unknown I definately recommend this to somebody who is looking for a more traditional Xcom experience.			"

												Love this game. It's very much like the old xcom granted minus some of the graphics of today. I enjoy the fights and while you don't have to do all of them, that's where I have my fun time. To me the game seems a little rushed in play as if you are not researching some things in the right order or making the money to build equipment or ships then you'll be a little on the low side to the aliens. I do feel like they could have added a few more battle fields as they do tend to get repetitive at times. I do wish the environments were a little more destructible like the old xcom. I have had aliens on a few battle fields disappear, which is frustrating when trying to track them down (still won the battle, but saw one shoot and then duck behind a corner and then couldn't find him. If he shots at me he needs to be accounted for in the body count. :) ). In game manual/help and xenopedia could be flushed out more such as, I've got the money to build a 3rd new base, but have been unable to do so. I'm sure that I'm missing something, but can't figure out what. So, little frustrated there. Original xcom was simple in what you could do comparatively (it's hard to match the formula when  it was perfect to begin with). Haven't had aliens attack one of my bases yet, while it seems that they have hinted at this by way of base defense I've yet to experience it so it makes me wonder if it was an idea that didn't quite make it.

												In X-Com, you trap the enemy with overwatch.In Xenonauts, the enemy camp the indestructible UFO, and overwatch the only door to access it.They know exactly where your team are, wherever they are. So they can sniper shot your team from across the map, way beyond the fog of war. Your soldiers usualy die in one hit, cover or not. Therefore, you often lose soldiers before you even know what you face. Lines of sight are a joke, as small obstacles likes a rock can reduce the chance to hit with a grenade, or even if you have the upper ground. Because the enemy have wall hack, the door game is atrocious. If they can, they'll open a door, shoot, then close it. You can't planify a breach like you do in X-Com.Air Game is nice tho.			"

								A hardcore take on classic XCOM-like topic with strong simulation, strategy, tactical, and RPG implementations. Although it's an indie, it's already in a pretty much playable state with rigid gameplay, plus the frequent updates from the developer. If you think you got the ingenuity to repel a hardcore alien invasion, this is the game worth playing for you. I highly recommend this.			"

								Live, learn, and halt an alien invasion. Watch your men get killed a lot. Set in 1979 it has the same X-COM feel with a similarly ominous soundtrack with a fresh Cold War paint job. The Xenonaut organization uses lots of cool colors, greys and blues, but the maps themselves are colorful and vibrant as you find your soldiers touring the globe in pursuit if the many different aliens hell bent on your destruction.Worth getting if you want a game that plays like the original X-COMs and/or if you weren't satisfied with the Firaxis XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Same kind of difficulty curve as the original X-COM, you fight hard for your victories. The devs also encourage ticking the ""Ironman Mode"" box for a more hardcore experience, so when the devs are flat out saying they don't cater to casuals you know you've got something special.Still a work in progress, but what's there is solid.8/10 would play on and on despite getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me at times.

												Personally, XCOM (2012) was a let down for me. My first experience with the original XCOM (I started with terror from the deep) was the cadence of managing everything on the macro level and then getting my men mowed down by the dozen in the tactical battles but still winning it. The new XCOM is great but featured too few soldiers for me to control tactically, which kind of limits the things I can do.Xenonauts is not without its own faults, but good gameplay is not one of them. Nothing beats flying into an alien base with 9 men, splitting them into squads of 3, and clearing the base in a 3-pronged attack. The 2d art is servicable and the animations are great, and it really feels like the original XCOMs with a graphics update and a new story. And that is all I ever wanted in a new game.I'd pick Xenonauts over the new XCOMs every time.			"

												Ah, good old Xenonauts, personally I find it to be as good of a game as xcom:eu and xcom 2, it does have it's flaws here and there, and it doesn't have the 3D of the modern xcom series but I find it to be a really cool experience nonetheless.Pros:-Really good strategy game-Has a Time Units system rather than the double move system from xcom:eu-A whole variety of UFOs to shoot down-A more in-depth soldier equipment screen than xcom:eu-Amazing artwork-Ability to research 2 or more projects at once-A pretty sweet modding community-Nice base building systemCons-2D map view rather then the 3D of xcom:eu-Game tends to get tedious as time goes on-Slighty buggy at times (luckily nothing unfixable)-Animations can be jerky at times-Graphics in ground combat mode aren't that pretty.The game really does has it's moments and it's pitfalls but after all I've said I still recommend it because it's still a good game and most of the bugs you can work around.

												Remember the old XCOM titles of the late 90’s? They were something truly special, masterpieces of the strategy and sci-fi genre’s, and while we had XCOM: Enemy Unknown in 2012, it’s something I felt didn’t quite live up to the originals due to its simplified nature, such as smaller squads and amount of hand-holding it insisted on. However, if I were to tell you there was now in fact a game that captured the perfection of XCOM in its own way and modernised it properly, would that sound too good to be true? Because that’s exactly what Xenonauts is.Xenonauts is an absolutely fantastic strategy game heavily influenced by the likes of XCOM and fans of the series will no doubt enjoy it thoroughly as it’s more of an updated throw-back to the older games as opposed to the newer ones. Newcomers to the genre though may be a little lost in its complexity due to the lack of any proper tutorial, however veterans will no doubt feel right at home and find a huge amount of content at their disposal. The amount of in-depth management can make the game feel like it drags on at times, but again, this is partially to do with the audience it is aimed at, so if you are looking for a more fast-paced game you certainly won’t find that, as it’s about being tactical and planning your moves carefully. The graphical style is very pleasant if a little simplistic but the overall cartoon-esque presentation makes it feel dated yet modern at the same time, giving it a very unique vibe. Ground combat was without a doubt one of my favourite parts of the game and is well designed and requires good tactical planning and thinking on the player’s part, even on the lower difficulties.

Posted: July 2, 2014
												I'm going to start out by saying that I fully support this game and reccomend it.  Despite any and all flaws it is well worth the money.It's been years since people have been trying to bring new life into this genre.  Many sequels and clones have gone by with mixed success.  Games like XCom: Apocalypse changed the formula too much, while a good game in it's own right, it alienated fans.  Other games like UFO: Afterlight and the series tried a different approach, but suffered from clunky menus and combat felt artificial.  The recent addition of XCom: Enemy Unknown introduced excellent graphics and animations, but this hid the fact that the strategic map was dumbed down to the point that UFOs that you didn't shoot down were not the cause of missions, in fact it was possible to shoot them all down and still have missions so long as you had a country somewhere you didn't have a satalite over.  The tactical was also super simplified.  I would call that one an XCom-lite if anything.Xenonauts does not have the flashy graphics of XCom: Enemy Unknown, nor does it vary far from the original.  However it is improved from the original in many ways and is what many fans have wanted.  It could be used as another start to evolve this hard to capture genre.Once again, UFOs are the sole source of missions on the strategic map.  If a UFO is ignored, it can generate a terror mission during a landing, or build an alien base.  No longer is there effects without causes.  In fact the atmosphere of the game is even enhanced by reports of UFO activity across the globe, such as new crop circles, missing ships, and cattle mutilations being reported in areas where you cannot track the UFOs.  Also every UFO comes with a mission of their own, something you will discover later in the game.  These missions affect their behavior, and you will have to adapt if you want to control the invasion before it's too late.Many clones/sequels allowed the player to overpower the aliens far too much.  This gave the aliens the feeling of being the underdogs despite the fact that they are the ones with the technological advantage.  Not so in Xenonauts.  While the majority of the alien fleet cannot attack immediately, buying you some time to prepare, their progress is at least in part based on your success.  If you are doing well, expect to see harder UFOs and aliens sooner than you otherwise might.  This leads you to having to make tough decisions like ""Do I let this UFO perform it's missions for a while before shooting it down?""  ""Do I want to raid every UFO for the bonus cash"" etc. because doing so can speed the rate of the invasion if you are successful.  In short, go to slowly and risk losing funding and nations.  Go too quickly and the Aliens will bring their main fleet before you're ready.  Can you walk that line?Even further you are quickly forced to decide between building better interceptors or getting better equipment for your troops.  Bullets will not do for long once aliens with armor start showing up.  Some will simply laugh off sustained fire if you aren't ready for them in time.  Defense is important too, as even the basic armor could be the difference between a shot instantly killing a soldier or not.  Even here, you cannot be reactive, as you stand to lose too much.  You have to learn to predict what you will need and when, and if you are wrong, you will pay.This game is a hard strategy game.  Every decision you make will have repercussions you might not have dreamed of down the road.  Your soldiers, while they improve, will never be the super soldiers you had in other games.  Tactics will always be important, with armor only saving you from a mistake or two if you are lucky.  A skilled player might be able to forgo armor completely, though I doubt he would do so flawlessly.  I personally am almost a year into my game and I have never used combat shields, something a lot of players say is a staple in their forces.  My body count isn't that high either, roughly at about a dozen.All this praise does come with a cost.  This game does have it's flaws.  If you need glasses, or have trouble reading small print, the fonts on the strategic map will kill your eyes.  I can barely read them as it is on 720p.  It may be better on 1080p, but that's not how I stream it.  This needs to get fixed.The graphics look like something out of Fallout 2 days.  They are excellent 2d graphics, but do not expect full 3d modelling here.  They spent more of their time making sure the gameplay worked well than actually building 3d graphics.  Still if you can overlook the graphics, there is a great game underneath.The interface, while greatly improved, is still very clunky.1.  Double clicking on a soldier in the management panel sometimes takes you to that soldier, sometimes not.  It's partly to do with how soldiers are organized on the equipment panel, partly to do with the double click speed required.2.  Planes that need to be refueled/repaired/reloaded cannot have any characteristics changed.  Even their name, or loadout.  It would be nice to be allowed to change a loadout while loading the plane with ammo.  This goes double for positioning soldiers on the dropships.3.  This is also a feature easily missed by most players, as it is hidden almost completely.  Placing a button from the loadout screen for the troops in the dropship to link to the positioning would help a lot.4.  The inability to rotate the map or hide walls makes it impossible to throw grenades on tiles behind them.This game takes place in 1979-early 80's.  Some things are anachronistic or inaccurate.1.  The basic starting rifle is the M16A2, which came into use in the 1980's.  It had a 3 round burst option and 30 round magazine.  The weapon that soldiers should be using is the M16E1 which had fully automatic options and a 20 round magazine.2.  The starting precision rifle pictured is a M16A4 which introduced a modular rail system to a rifle similar to the M16A2 allowing for the addition of scopes, laser targetting and the like.  It would have had a 30 round magazine as well, instead of the 6 rounds given.  Instead they should have used the M16E1 fitted with a scope off to the side, with a 20 round magazine.3.  The machine gun pictured is the M249 squad automatic weapon.  This weapon is designed to fire ammo from a belt in a drum underneath the barrel.  It can use M16 magazines, however this is not reccomended due to severe jamming issues.  A M249 belt comes in 3 sizes: 100 round for training, 250 round infantry drum, and 500 round vehicle mounted drum.4.  Night vision scopes were around for the Vietnam war, and should be available for snipers in night missions in the game.  Full night vision goggle(s) however will not be seen till later in the 80's.  A possible tech to research and produce them would have been a nice touch as necessity is the mother of invention they say, and something to counter the alien's advantage at night would have been a welcome choice.  Night vision goggle(s) do however restrict vision, and accuracy due to the way they operate.5.  The starting grenade pictured is a fragmentation grenade.  It has a kill radius of 10 meters with an effective radius of 5 meters.  It does not do it's damage by concussive force, but by shards of metal, like bullets, flying out in all directions.  I cannot speak of how alien grenades work, but a rework of basic grenades should be in order to make them effective in this regard.6.  Flares burn can start fires easily but do not do so in game.  Smoke grenades produce smoke slowly, and will only burn your hand if you aren't wearing leather gloves.  They should not be starting fires in this game.7.  Bazookas are not easily reloadable in field.  Carrying one as a side implement should be an option for a soldier, but ammo preloaded.  The M25 rocket launcher however could fire multiple rockets, but was a mounted weapon.			"

												If you were a fan of the old Xcom series, you will find this a excellent step in the series. I liked how they chose to steamline the purchasing of some of the smaller stuff. (No more having to buy every clip of ammo and every flare.)The only downside is that the missions can become a grind. (But they give you a option to skip them and still get some reward)I personally found the air combat hard to grasp, simply sim'ing it was easy enough though.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E23 Xenonauts 

			Views: 603		

			Looking to get that X-Com fix? Want something with a different name but still the same game underneath? Didn’t like the modern X-Com remake? Try Xenonauts!		

Xenonauts: Xenonauts is a turn-based combat, alien defense simulator. You play the role as the commander of a special military force designated Xenonauts, who are tasked with the defense of earth from extra-terrestrial invaders. You’ll manage multiple bases you place on the globe, build ground and air forces to combat the alien threat, and defend humanity. Research technology gathered from shot down UFOs, and craft advance weapons, armor, vehicles and aircraft to keep toe to toe with the aliens as the get progressively tougher. Xenonauts is a fantastic spiritual sequel to X-COM UFO Defense, with the entire game playing out almost exactly the same. With that come some very odd choices. You can’t rotate the map and there are many situations where targeting becomes an issue, and a great irritation. Aliens also like to use the open and close door tactic; during the alien’s turn, they can open doors which close for them after their turn ends, this means they will stay glued to the other side of a door, come out the on their turn, take shots at your soldiers and retreat back to safety, however, when attempting this tactic yourself, the door stays open the entire round, meaning the aliens are free to shoot back during their turn. Aliens even seem to know this tactics as many times they are often waiting right behind doors, making it very annoying to advance through bases or UFOs without a guarantee of losing at least one soldier along the way, the only real remedy I found was blowing the doors to high heaven. The other unfortunate, and boring part of the game is the aircraft combat. The aircraft combat is a top-down view where you set waypoints for your ships to travel, it isn’t easy to change the flight path on the fly and the whole experience feels very slow and unbalanced, I almost always resorted to the auto-resolve, which has its own problems. When auto-resolve is at 100% it’s a guarantee victory, however, if you engage in the real time combat you can actually lose all of your fighters. On the flip side, there have been battles with an auto-resolve 0% rating but, when I engaged in the combat I was able to win. Also, alien space ships seem to have unlimited ammo while you have a very limited amount for your own fighters. The whole thing felt messy and unrewarding, you don’t get to see your ships engage in the combat other than green radar blips you see all the time, so auto-resolve seemed the best and most convenient way to deal with the aliens, this is a pretty big part of the game aside from ground combat and it’s a shame it isn’t more exciting or balanced, there’s also no way to take down aircraft without damaging it. The other major complaint I have is the lack of mission variety, crash sites are won either by eliminating all aliens or capturing and holding their ships for 5 turns, alien bases are won by either destroying the power core or eliminating all aliens. Those are the only two varieties and couple that with small map variety and the game can start feeling very tedious. Some other things felt missing like a graph for finance and approval ratings from the various countries and just some minor graphical bugs I’ve experienced. I’ve enjoyed my time with Xenonauts, and would like to see it expanded upon, with more maps, missions, added tools and utilities, and better combat and varied environments. I could go into more detail, honestly, I’m seriously happy with Xenonauts despite my gripes with the combat aspect, I want more and always have and will and the game here is very well crafted with great visuals, music and atmosphere. Thankfully there is a great modding community who may add all that I could think of in a Xenonauts game, but, in the future, I wish for the game to be successful and for more to be added on by the creators. TL/DL; Xenonauts is a great spiritual sequel of the X-Com series. If you like those games remotely, you’ll love this one. It’s heavy with atmosphere, mostly great combat, the thrill of progress and the feeling you get when you nail a tough mission with flying colors.-Thumbs up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												If you ever wanted to play the original X-COM from 1994 without the terrible graphics or terrible UI Xenonauts is as close as it gets. This game is deeply rooted in old school style, which in turn is a good and a bad thing.It’s one of those games were you’re going to struggle a lot your first time through if you are unfamiliar with the game and its mechanics. It’s a very entertaining game but also quite frustrating and vague at times. Unlike the XCOM reboots (which are fantastic by the way) this game has far greater complexity and player freedom. The game is incredibly in depth in a great way, it’s just unfortunate it’s very poorly explained. There’s so much here that isn’t in the XCOM reboots (Or the originals). The research tree and the technology you can create are vast as well.I really loved the setting and art style myself. Set in 1979 during the height of the cold war, the setting really grounds the game.  All the technology and buildings feel realistic in their world. Even the aliens and UFO’s themselves have a very realistic feel to them. While some may not like the 2D style of the game the sprites and maps are clean and well done.  I also appreciate the increased focus on intercepting, assaulting, and salvaging of UFO’s (which is the whole point of the game and the original X-COM) compared to the XCOM reboots.  Which in those games it only happened once in a while.Regardless the game is far from perfect. As stated above the game is incredibly complex but really poorly explained. However there is a manual, which does cover some things. That and the occasional cheapness of the AI which can shoot you from half across the map at a million different directions. What’s worse is the bug that allows them to shoot through walls. The game also has some pacing issues as it can feel way too chaotic at times. Finally the RNG is just too much, seriously if you thought XCOM’s RNG had some issues you haven’t played Xenonauts. Overall good game, just not for everyone:  8/10  "

												So, like a lot of people I was first interested in this when the kickstarter was announced - an XCOM remake in all but name? Take my money sir! And then Firaxis came along, announced their ""reimagining"" and release a truly brillian game in it's own right. It was X-COM, not quite XCOM but an excellent game. In the meantime Goldhawk (a little frustratingly at times) slowly got on with finishing their game and now it's been released.So is it any good? This is the closest you are going to get to replaying XCOM again. OK so they can't use the same names or anything, they've set it in the 1970s (which, by the way was a minor stroke of genius) but works. It works sooo well. If you played and loved XCOM, then you can pick this up without even having to refer to an instruction manual. It does play a little differently yes  - the beefed up air combat being the main difference, something which I haven't really come to grips with so I'm heavily reliant on the ""auto-resolve"" button - but they flavour text accompanying the game is genuinely funny in places and very well written.It lacks some of the creeping dread of XCOM on some of the missions (their Cryssalid replacement for example bears a remarkable resembalance to the Warhammer 40K Tyranid lictor) and suffers for it for some reason, and some of the models are maybe a little lacking. However the UFO design is excellent, and clearing them out a real tactical workout on occasion. I've not ""finished"" it yet, but all I can say a couple of hours of playing this over development and now release is that it's pretty damned good. If you tried the Firaxis version and it didn't click for you, then believe me this will.  Well worth the purchase price for any XCOM fan.			"

								After the grand disapointment that Firaxis delivered in the form of X-com: Enemy Unknown and the slightly better game that came afterwards. I was looking for a game that had more focus on the strategy, the base building, on the various aspects of running a company that is the sole defence against aliens.Xenonauts delivers, and though it was rather buggy in various of the alpha stages, the game has matured and become an all round great game to play.You've got base management to focus on, every structure you build having a goal and purpose.There's research and development going on, getting your troops better armor and weapons, or upgrading the weapons on your aircraft, researching and manufacturing newer ships to fight the aliens with.Every soldier has a large variety of stats that upgrade and increase the more missions you play with the, and that progression really makes a difference, making every soldier a more and more valuable asset, making losing them that much more bitter when it does happen.But that's fun, because unlike Firaxis's itterations of the game, where you were always pushed into certain behaviors to be the most efficient. Xenonauts offers you a lot more flexibility right from the start.You have the whole world to defend, you can start wherever you want with your base and develop your team towards your ideal. Various types of grenades and a whole list of weapon types give you complete control over the battlefield, over what you want your soldiers to do and how you want them to evolve.The game isn't easy though, because like the older generation it's based on, things can simply go wrong, an alien enemy with poor eye sight might still one of your own men by chance, and the results could be deadly! Good tactics help you out though, good preparation and positioning allowing you to jump enemies before they can possibly respond to your actions.This is a fantastic game, especially if you loved the older games. The strategy, the management, the ufopedia, it's all very well put together, giving you a great time all around.			"

												If you like the original XCOM, this is a very good game.  Very similar, with some enhancements to the UI and all.Set in the early Cold War, it fits pretty well in that setting.Most of my complaints would be nitpicky and minor.  The art and graphics are kinda bland, but do fit the 60s theme fairly well.  The invasion does seem to ramp up pretty quickly (though it might be pegged to research?), and keeping up the income and trying to expand bases is something I find difficult.Things like aircraft armaments and grenades upgrading automatically, not having to manufacture ammunition and grenades, those are helpful updates to not get bogged down in as much minor micromanagement.Now that it's open for modding, there's getting to be some good options to enhance.  The latest patch was helpful too.If you like the tactical turn-based combat, it's definitely a good game to play.			"

												Best tacticts since Jagged Alliance 2Plus everything we loved about UFO1 and more, way more.Graphics take time to get used to though.The setting - lore, xenopedia articles, research reports - create an immersive atmosphere, even more immersive than that of recent X-Com(2012)Best thing I like is honest Alien AI - they will send interceptor patrols after you shoot down a few ships, they will counter-attack as you surround their ship in tactics mode, they don't hesitate to use grenades. Shot trajectories are in gun combat - bullets will hit obstacles and units on their way.All in all - the first game in ~7 years (since GalCiv2) that made me suddenly realize it's dawn already and I haven't slept yet.

												It's hard. It's punishing. And I love it!Xenonauts is a game where you can actually feel the domination of an alien force, invading earth. You'll find yourself in a dire situation, heavily outgunned against a technologically superior race - a situation which is well known in common SciFi movies. And you will suffer - a situation which is very unknown in common video games! You first encounters will likely end with heavy losses, half of your crew dead or critically wounded. But with time you struggle your way up the food-chain, gaining the upper hand and deliver payback! I recommend to play it on Iron Man Mode! If it feels too hard, try an easier level, but leave the Iron Man Mode activated. Yes, it is painfull to lose a good soldier because of a stupid mistake on the battlefield. Very painfull. But it's realistic and the fear for losses creates a strong bond to all your crew members! The ""Save & Reload"" tactic will destroy a good part of your game experience with Xenonauts.			"

												I lost my whole squad. It all started with a single reaper, this reaper snuck through my lines undetected, and like a whisper in the wind, snuck up on my #1 guy. This new reaper, then managed to matrix all of my bullets my men had, then infected another soldier. At this moment, my entire squad went into a frenzy of panic shots and fleeing, one my one my men either killed each other or ran right into another reaper. Soon, all I had was my last guy. I sent this last man sprinting to the chopper so I could get him the hell out of there, and when he got there...........A reaper was waiting for him.10/10 would lose my whole squad again.			"

Early Access Review
								Xenonauts is a refreshing throwback to XCOM's classic glory days. One could say that this is a more truthful-to-the-source remake of the XCOM franchise than any of the new games. Xenonauts features a deep and intimidating tactical combat system, one which will be familiar to anyone who has played almost any TBS game or XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, but with such a larger difficulty curve that you will at times be left feeling hollow, alone and abused as your squad of soldiers gets minced like tender beef in a meat grinder. The game makes a respectful nod in the direction of the original XCOM games, in that it is virtually impossible not to suffer casualties at some point in your game. Where as the recent titles even had achievements encouraging you to try completing a campaign without anyone dying, or having a lone soldier complete a mission, in Xenonauts both these tasks are virtually impossible.The reasons behind the difference in diffuclty doesn't come from a more advanced or biased AI, but simply more input that players have to manage. Not only on the ground with your soldiers, but also back at base and infact globally. Your soldiers inventories have to be carefully managed, ensuring they have enough weapons and ammunition to last their contact with the aliens, but also not overloading them to the point that they suffer TU (Time Units, the equivalent of Action Points) penalties that cripple them and make it difficult for your men and women to gun the enemy down then make a hasted retreat to cover. On mention of cover, more things are destrucable on Xenonauts too. Where as in XCOM: EU/W there were some indestructable cover options that would at worst explode, but still offer protection, in Xenonauts pretty much anything that can be used as practical cover can also be turned into dust. So often, it becomes the case that you don't just want a wall between you and the aliens, but several and a yew yards of empty space from the walls too so you don't get caught in any collateral damage.Moving onto perhaps the more important part of the game (at least in terms of your chance of success in the campaign to save Earth), the Geoscape. You're given access to a global map and allowed to place your bases (Yes, plural. You can have, nay, WILL NEED, multiple bases at some point in your game) anywhere you like in the world. Whether you want to set up your alpha base in New York state, the Guangzhou province of China or perhaps just outside of Zimbawe, you're given some pretty hefty freedom on this matter. Though you also need to consider something else when placing bases. Their radar range. Since you're not fed mission options on a timed basis like in XCOM EU/W, you need to ensure that your base is in a decent position where not only will your base be able to detect incoming alien vessels, but also that there's a landmass large enough to make sure you can then follow up and board any crashed ships to kill surviving aliens and salvage their equipment. Poor base placement early on can lead to a starved economy, as you're largely funded by your actuall progress rather than on whether you chose one country over another in mission options.Additional to the base placement in the Geoscape is the base's design itself. You choose how the facility will be constructed, what building will go where. And this will be reflected later in game when the alien menace starts to invade your base. So rather than just filling every single space you can with facilities, you may want to build so that the aliens have few channels to transport through your base. Maybe even forcing them to bottle neck one way in, since they always break in via your hangars.Mention of hangars brings up another very important aspect of the game. Managing your aerospace force. Especially later on in the game, you'll find yourself getting swamped with radar readings for multiple UFO sightings. And since your fighters aren't equipped with an unlimited supply of fuel or ammunition, their ability to engage targets is quite limited. So you'll want to ensure you've enough hangars and jets filling them to confront any aerial menace that pops up within radar range. Without this ability to combat UFO's, you'll quickly run out of funding and let the planet fall into a state of panic.To sumarise what I'm trying to convey here, Xenonauts is XCOM for big boys. It's challenging, frustrating but overwhelmingly satisfying when you get a moment where you feel like you're doing well. Even if those moments are short lived, as the aliens will likely knock you back down a peg in the next terror mission filled with Reapers.			"

												Very enjoyable.Only problems are (a lack of) variety in some missions and one breed of aliens that heals infinetly.Variety can be solved with mods either from the workshop or forums (or just get the Community Edition). I'd also grab the mod allowing you to breach other parts of the UFOs.Regenerating aliens would work better if their permanent health was reduced each time they were damaged (the way health kits work for humans). This may happen already for all I know.True sucessor to X-COM compared to the 'simplified' Enemy Unknown.			"

Second playthrough on Ironman is going not too badly, but keep losing tons of soldiers and equipment, setting me back months and months. Needs.1) Active defense vs Psionic powers or severe range penalties to said powers.2) Had to consult wiki too much, more ingame resources needed.3) Advanced drop ships need defense vs interceptors.4) Less enemy rocket launchers, who would guard their own base with mostly these?5) The lizard aliens with the crazy regen should charge more instead of trying to ambush all the time.6) Needs a chance to run and heal someone that fell between 0 and -10 hp, putting them out of the mission of course.

												I could write how this game is, in its essence, a faithful yet innovative recreation of Gollop brothers' original X-COM. I could say that it captures the feeling and addictiveness of its precursor, building upon its concepts, expanding or modernizing them, while still staying faithful to the original. I could list the elements present in it, like base administration, research and production, UFO activity management, interceptions and, of course, the meat of the matter – ground missions; and then go on praising how well, for the most part, they were executed. Rather that all that, I'm just going to say that Xenonauts passed the most important test, by which I judge games based on other titles – that is, while playing it, not for a moment I found myself wanting to go back the old game instead.EDIT : Nominated for ""Just 5 More Minutes"" 2016 Steam Award... and well dervered too!

Recommended: A faithful spiritual successor to the original X-Com: UFO Defense game that adds some strong additional mechanics that add to the game, but misses out on some of the quality-of-life things from that predecessor and has a some jankiness in places, particularly the UI. Nonetheless, something I can easily recommend, both taken as a spiritual successor, and more importantly, as a game on it's own merits.Full review is available here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												Xenonauts fully lives up to being a proper spiritual successor to the classic 90's X-COM. While it lacks the high production visuals of the recent Firaxis X-COM, Xenonaut's simple & clean visuals work very well to convey mood and feel. The strategy and tactical layers of the game are more sophisticated than the classic XCOM and offers an excellent challenge for veteran players.The game is also highly moddable (and easy to do via simple xml file edits) which will surely lead to plenty of game changing mods.Anyone who played the classic X-COM (and lesser Terror from the Deep) or enjoys deep strategic / tactical games will find plenty to enjoy with Xenonauts. I cannot recommend it enough.			"

												I was involved -- for certain definitions of the word ""involved"" -- in the beta/early access phases of Xenonauts over the course of several months, maybe even a year or so.During that time, the developer consistently showed little to zero willingness to consider alternate ideas of game design, overreacted when balance changes were needed, forced certain game tactics onto the players, and had a very scatterbrained approach to overall game philosophy. And, they committed the absolute worst crime a developer can commit during a paid early access/beta period: They refused to listen to bug reports on several occasions if the bug didn't repro in the dev build. At one point I had to spend over an hour painstakingly summing alien TUs and making a YouTube video just to prove a bug existed, despite it being reported by a half-dozen different people, most of whom encountered it on their very first mission in a new game.In terms of the game design: At early stages, your troops will be shot and killed. On your turn. The AI is highly defensive and usually spends under 1/3 of their own AP during their turn unless humans are visible. If no humans are immediately visible, the AI will not hunt for them, they will take defensive positions and wait. The reaction fire system is poorly coded, being based on what % of a characters' TUs are remaining: If an alien is sitting around the corner with 100% of their TUs (and this happens a lot), as soon as a soldier turns the corner they will almost certainly get shot at. Usually two or three times. With weapons that have a very high chance to instakill a human.As humans design new and better weapons, such as laser or plasma replacing standard ballistics, you do more damage but have smaller clips. That's it. There are no other changes from one tier to another, despite developer promises that more interesting design would be implemented later in the process. There are a ton of forum posts where players debated back and forth how the various tiers ought to be balanced against each other, with each tier shining in certain regions and maybe being lackluster in others. For example, I was a proponent that plasma weaponry ought to do massive damage but have ammo and range drawbacks, while lasers have voluminous ammo stores and long range but only moderate firepower. Attack TU costs are based entirely on percentage of total TUs, meaning those soldiers who can move faster can't actually fight any more effectively, they are just more mobile. This was a late change in the development process, being added with only a few months to spare. When I tried it and disliked it, I was insulted by the community as well as the developer, being told that he ""wouldn't go over the reasons [for switching to a percent TU system] again."" The entire ground combat design (about 60% of the game) is tilted in favor of the AI. Elements like % TU costs for firing and reaction fire require constant calculations and re-calculation to know whether or not a given troop can, say, reach cover and fire a shot. There is no simple mechanism in-game to simplify this for the player. In the end, I don't recommend this game, unless you have a particular desire to fill a pad of paper with calculations, spending your time reading the xml files to figure out how things actually work, and getting your people shot.If you really, REALLY want to re-play the original X-COM... just go and replay X-COM. Get DOSBox running on your computer and replay the classic. Xenonauts is a game that wants to be X-COM but fails to either properly modernize it or recreate it.			"

												If you are a fan of the original X-Com games and if you liked the turn-based gameplay, this is for you! Xenonauts captures perfectly the feeling of the original. It is a perfect remake with nice oldschool graphics and even some new features like aircombat. For me, as I very much liked playing the Firaxis remake, this game adds the depth I was missing. All the micromanagement, the base building, managing of aircrafts, soldiers, science and so on. This is fun and I can absolutely recommend this game. It still has some bugs though, but not as much and not as severe as many games from big developer studios are released with (e.g. ""day one patches""). This is money well spent, and I surely will play this game again and again. The X-Com addiction is back.			"

												Turn-based strategy is one of my favorite genres, I grew up on stuff like Fire Emblem and Advance Wars.Xenonauts is much more hardcore and simulator-esque than those games are, but it does so in a way that's extremely rewarding and fun. All the little decisions you can make (like those regarding the minutia of each unit's equipment) genuinely mean something and impact the game, I never once felt like the detailed interface or combat systems held me back, rather they allowed me more tactical freedom and room to be clever.If you want to play super aggro with flashbangs and aggressive shotgun units, you can. If you want to play super careful with extreme range snipers, shielded scouts and rocketeers to demolish cover, you can. The more you put your mind to it the more you'll discover little tricks and strategies of your own. Even the simplistic dogfighting minigame provides room for tricky flanking maneuvers and thoughtful use of ammunition.(PS: Do yourself a favor and don't savescum. Fear, suspense, and tragedy are crucial to the experience!)			"

Where 'graphics' are not-so-important for the immersion is greater, and your choices you must think through.......not 'just' see-through ;)On that note, this game really reminds me of the Isometric Swat4 I don't know how they do it, make games like these but do it they good and more often it should....

												OK. I have seriously mixed feelings here.I am one of those folks who spent hundreds and hundreds of hours Playing the original XCOM. I played it on Playstation, even with all the crappy control bugs it had, including the awesomeness of having your soldiers run right out into the middle of an empty area with aliens all around when you tried to end a turn.And I loved every controller-throwing moment of it. It was and forever will be my favorite game of all time.This game is essentially an XCOM: UFO Defense clone. Same technologies (laser weapons, plasma weapons, interceptors, avalanche missiles, etc.). It's almost like the XCOM universe equivalent of Spaceballs, only instead of the Force and the Schwartz, you've got Sectiods and Caesans, Elerium and Alenium, alien alloys and...alien alloys.It's virtually THE SAME GAME.Depending on who you are, that's either a really, really good thing or a bad thing. This title brings back things that made the old game feel more tactical than the 2K version like time units, rotating soldiers to look different directions, and multiple bases. It feels much more like the old Microprose game than the 2K reboots. There are some new elements like scrambling squadrons of interceptors rather than individual planes, a tactical air combat battle system that didn't exist in the original, doors on the sides of the Skyranger (oops, I mean dropship), which is nice so you don't have to knowingly unload all your operatives out the back into certain death in certain situations.It's definitely fun and nostalgic.I picked it up on sale so I'm more or less content, but in all honesty I was hoping for more originality and less blatant copying of the original format.If you pine for the days of the original XCOM and The Long War mod for the 2K version didn't tweak the AAA reboot enough, I recommend this game and give the devs props for their faithful recreation (and slight enhancements). If you're looking for a title that's breaking new ground, I would look elsewhere.			"

								A turn-based strategy game that mimics the original XCOM games that started the genre in the mid-90s, Xenonauts is one of the better indie games currently in development. You start with a ragtag group of soldiers with the best technology humankind has to offer, which isn't much. Aliens invade with their own weapons in great force, striking against ships and towns, and it's up to you to shoot down their UFOs, aqcuire their technology, and use it against them before they turn human forces against you. Much like the originals, you never really have the upper-hand. As the game progresses and you learn the secrets of alien technology, the invasion ramps in difficulty with larger UFOs and more intelligent aliens armed with even stronger weaponry.  You must rely on your own planning and a bit of luck to pull through. The game can be brutally difficult and is not ideal for people new to turn-based strategy.For gameplay footage of v19 Beta:

												Do I like Xenonauts? Yes.Do I recomend Xenonauts? If you've played XCom: UFO Defense/UFO: Enemy Unknown, Jagged Alliance 2, Breach and Clear, Silent Storm, or the new Xcom, and enjoyed it- you'll like Xenonauts.Every update adds not only features I'm used to, but new features that streamline and improve the experience.At the time of this writing, I'd say that the game is probably a year off being pretty much complete, but the current level of development is impressive. I'm looking forward to the final product, and have absolute belief that it's going to be one of the deepest and most compelling games on the market.EDIT: Final product review, 07.OCT.14.Xenonauts has turned out to be everything I'd hoped for. This is the true spiritual successor to Julian Gollop's genre-defining UFO: Enemy Unknown (AKA XCOM: UFO defense). There were only two games that ever perfectly demonstrated the potential of the turn-based tactical genre- Jagged Alliance 2 and UFO: Enemy Unknown. These two pillars of the genre are now joined by Xenonauts.The grand strategy? It's there. The micromanagement? It's there. The research and development? It's there. The tactical challenges of storming a crashed UFO full of very hacked-off aliens with plasma weapons? Oh, yeah, it's there.  If you're a 'thinking' gamer rather than a twitching gamer, this is a game that lets you sink into the role of planetary defence coordinator. Hours can slip by as you arrange UFO interceptions, juggle base creation against reserach and development, and weigh up airstrikes on a crashed UFO against sending in recovery teams.I cannot recommend this game highly enough to the grognard-type gamer who wants a deep gaming experience without interface complications. I honestly place Xenonauts in my top ten games of all time- and I've been playing computer games for thirty-five years. Bravo, Goldhawk. Bravo. Here's hoping you make enough money from Xenonauts to buy the rights to the Jagged Allliance IP and treat it better than the last mob of semi-competents. The last feedback I can give is to comment that it's a little jarring to have female special forces soldiers in a game set in the 70's/80's, but I'll take a little Sarkeesian-mollifying Social Justice Warrior history revisionism if it means I get to play a game this good.

												BIAS NOTE: I personally think the Original X-Com / UFO is the best game ever made, so my opinion is slightly loaded.Xenonauts is an old school base management and turn based tactical strategy game based on the 1993 game X-Com: UFO defence / UFO: Enemy Unknown designed to savagely punish and bemuse the unwary, but inside many rewarding things can be found.If there has been one marker of the 2010s in games it has been nostalgia goggles. In the late 2000s the mid 20 to 40 something have been looking back on the games they grew up on and wonder why the IPs are being abused and how the content they grew up on now no longer exists. Weird reboots of series such as Syndicate and the announced X-Com sat badly with people and much yelling happened. Then Kickstarter happened, and... the less said about Kickstarter as a whole the better. Some results however were fantastic and Goldhawk Interactive's Xenonauts was a good example of a dev sticking to the original quite tightly.For old X-Com / UFO players Xenonauhts is a very faithful update to the original series containing the iconic tactical map, intercepting, base management and, of course, the turn based ground missions. The whole game will no doubt be extremely familiar to old X-Com vets and within a few minutes you will be back to reserving Time Units for snap shots and figuring out how to research those alien corpses.Xenonauts does make some small updates and the game is different in subtle ways, mainly in the context of balance, streamlining and user friendliness. Air combat is more interesting with areal dogfights being a bit more interactive, ground combat involves less clicking about and a number of fluffy items have been removed e.g. mind probes and while there are the clear super-powered weapons, there are no blaster launchers with an almost magical ""I win"" button effect. The interface and micromanagement has also been overhauled, for example ammo management, manufacture, purchase and scavenging is not as much of a stress as the original games, but at the same time the big money makers like selling the excess enemy weapons and corpses are done away with. Essentially you are not going to play database sim while trying to figure out what you have and have not researched.While the game has clearly been rebalanced around these new systems, it is still the same as the original in the context of how bloody minded and unforgiving it is. Unless you save-scum (which Ironman mode helps you resist) early missions are more than likely going to be bogged down with many, many dead soldiers. Even on easy mode this game is brutally unforgiving and will quite happily kill your commander with a reaper from behind.Reapers in this game are essentially Chryssalids. Yeah, they brought them back.A major turn off for many however will be the abstract nature of the game. Like the new reboot of Xcom Xenonauts also includes the diceroll random luck when you attack enemies. One second you will get a perfect crit damage shot from a human pistol miles from the target and take down a Andron in one hit, then you use the Mag carbine (basically the top end shotgun that fires railgun slugs) at point blank range and somehow miss with all the every pellet. While you can indeed be very tactical and be a military genius in reality, in game you will sometimes just come out unlucky as the guy with the LMG gets mind controlled sitting a few feet away from the remainder of your crew. Ultimately this is one of the strongest pulls the X-Com series always had so it would be rather unfaithful to remove it, but if you absolutely want a game of skill without any behind the scenes dice-rolling abstraction then this game is not advised at all.At the end of the day Xenonauts is either a love letter to the old fans, or if new a masochistic punch in the face. If you are looking for a turn based strategy game that will punish you, regardless of if you deserve it or not at times, then this one is a good pick.And yes they brought back Cryssalids. THEY BROUGHT BACK THE MOST FRIGGING EVIL MOSTER IN GAMING HISTORY! WHY GOD?! OH WHY?!?!?!?			"

												Soo, Xenonauts are out. And they are damn awesome.Wanted that old school X-com like game, but with fresh graphics, mods and enhancements?Didn't get that from new XCOM series? Want multiple bases? Interceptors? Inventories for soldiers? Well, Xenonauts got you covered. This game is better at being X-com than anything else new out there.More details in the video:

												I'm a bit bummed about this game. I had lots of friends recommend it to me due to my love of 2012 XCOM, and even more recommend it to me after I got around to playing and beating the original UFO and TFTD. I had high hopes going in, really expecting to love this game. Unfortunately... I didn't. I haven't even finished it yet, and I don't think I even will. I've hit a wall, not due to difficulty or too many countries dropping out, but instead my own lack of enthusiasm to keep going. With the original games, the game was slowly ramping up as you made more progress and got better equipment. In 2012, it was somewhat the same, however you would reach a point where you could really stomp out the threat. I like both of these models, X-COM faces you with an always increasing danger even as you make progress, and XCOM gives you the chance to overpower your oppenent entirely.Xenonauts really has neither of these. I feel no more capable of fighting the threat with the best armor and weapons available than I do with the starting equipment, and I'm still facing the same aliens. It feels like there is huge lack of variety with the aliens, as it seems all of them were introduced before I even got the second weapon type. Even with the best armor and weapons, it still takes multiple shots to kill a single alien, while they can still kill you in one hit. The difficulty just feels completely static, the only things I actually feel are changing in difficulty are the interceptor encounters.This game really improves a lot on the original X-COM, but it just lacks the charm. I just don't feel excited to see what comes next, because so far everything that has come next has been basically the same. If you liked the original X-COM, you'll probably like this, but it's just not as charming. I'm disappointed.			"

 As of writing this, Goldhawk Interactive (devs) are in the making of a sequel. I say this to raise awareness if you find yourself buying this game and enjoying it, as they've taken huge steps in listening to and incorporating feedback from the community. -----------------------------------------------------First off, it's inevitable that XCOM will be mentioned at some point, so lets start there. Yes, you're likely to enjoy this if you enjoyed the original XCOM games. Xenonauts began as a passion project on Kickstarter for those wanting to relive the original XCOM experience. It stays mostly true to XCOM without replicating it, even expanding on originally lacking features like interceptor combat, which is now much more involved.Some elements of this game work in real-time (aerial combat, although you can pause), but the majority of your time (~85%) will be spent in grounded, turn-based missions. I should mention that both ground and aerial combat missions are skip-able, but of course you'll miss out on a lot of resources if you decide to pass on them. There  are  workshop (cheat) mods out there that allow you to essentially skip areas of gameplay you might not enjoy, so if you find yourself wanting to focus on the ground-based missions for example and ignore the Geoscape, you can pretty much do that. About aerial combat: it is, in my opinion, not that great. It's not particularly bad, but it doesn't feel fleshed out beyond the dodge and missile mechanics. I tend to think of it more like an optional mini-game that gives you a break from other points of strategy every now and then. On a normal run I found myself skipping most aerial combat scenarios with little to no penalty for doing so, and apparently that's fine. Although I didn't enjoy it personally, I'm glad I was given the option to skip as it seems a more experimental point of gameplay compared to everything else. Ground combat is brilliant, and most things in the Geoscape are brilliant. You'll need patience and time to plan out your approach to the alien invasion, particularly since this game is a multifaceted strategy. By the end, you'll probably be managing several bases and many troops/employers/vehicles at the same time. For those reasons, this might be a game you need to stick to before moving on, and certainly not play if you're an amnesiac. That would leave you with an overwhelming amount of management to do and no memory on how to do it. Also, if you like your micro/macro organisation, you'll fall in love with this. In the micro sense for example, each soldier can be personalized by name and load-out (there's a pretty huge arsenal if you research weapons), with class-specific types you can set as defaults. One thing that's lacking which affects both ground combat and the Geoscape, is vehicles. Only one vehicle variant exists in this game and it requires a hefty amount of resources to get up and running. But... is it worth it? No. Even when you acquire it, you sacrifice two soldiers in exchange for having it on the ground. Unfortunately it isn't even worth two soldiers. In short, vehicles are pretty underdeveloped in this game and almost not worth bothering about. You can upgrade it into pure bad-assery way later on, but the climb to get there isn't economically efficient. Another flaw: monsters and civilians sometimes have stupid AI. Aliens tend to be at their deadliest when they're throwing grenades at you non-stop and the AI still has issues with pathing and awareness, as it tends to know where you are half the time without a good reason as to why. I was able to ignore these issues as the experience was mostly fluid.Oh, as a side note; pretty much everything in ground combat is destructible. My lord, the writing. It is monstrously good, and might honestly be the best experience with reading I've ever had in a game ever. And normally I  hate  taking time to read in games. Hell, Xenonauts even comes with it's own novella, yes, a freaking  novella  hidden away in the extra features. Now, I don't think it compares to the in-game text you get for completing research projects, but it's still kind of impressive that they actually hired an author to do it. One of the major things keeping me coming back to this game was the thought of completing a research project and being handed a bit more information of the alien invasion. SO, I recommend this game. It's worth the price, but most of all it's a lot of fun. A lot of issues posted in top reviews have been fixed/have fixes for download or are already within the game but need to be enabled. I suggest that upon starting the game you click the mod manager and enable the mod already downloaded which adds a ton of map variety. I'll close out saying Xenonauts has a lot of really awesome mods in the Steam workshop section, so at the very least give it a glance over before or after playing for your first time. The community is regularly patching this with updates even after the devs recently stopped, so there's also a community build if you switch over to beta.			"

												Decent take on an alien invasion simulation. Closely resembles the original UFO: Defense, but with new graphics style, verbage, and its own unique aliens.Still has a few annoying bugs and things that never got polished, but playable.Recommended for fans of turn-based squad tactics games.

												A fantastic X-Com style strategy game, the basics are the same but there are enough changes to keep it fresh and interesting, i.e. combat is more streamlined, adds more action to arial combat, differences in the tech tree. Highly recommended, lots of replay value. It needs more variation in maps and a few more weapons and armor.			"

												I had doubts about whether I would be able to enjoy this after playing Firaxis's XCOM, but boy was I wrong. If you've enjoyed the challenge the original Julian Gollop's X-COM provided, Xenonauts is going to delight your socks off.The dev team behind it have come a long way and have learnt quite a few lessons from other X-COM spiritual successors released before it. This shows as a much more fine tuned balance between being able to micromanage while still feeling like the overall commander-in-charge of your organisation. The oppressive feeling of a world unsure of your ability to deliver its salvation adds to the atmosphere of urgency, uncertainty, dread and hope all at once. Planetary Defence Simulator indeed.Highly recommended!			"

												If you ever enjoyed Xcom, the strategy ones, you will enjoy this game. It seems like a more up to date xcom classic with features that are more in-depth than Xcom: Enemy Unkown. I have spent up to ten minutes thinking out just one move in the turn based combat system. You will have to weigh options as you build your base and research new technologies to combat the alien threat better. This can be done in many ways as you shoot down UFOs and have to decide wether or not you should go to the crash site or airstrike it to just gain money. Overall you will have to face choices that can make or break your game. If you enjoy xcom then you will enjoy this game.			"

It has all the features that made the origenal such a huge hit, plus quite a few of those little extras you secretly wished was in x-com.  Can't be bothered to recover the small ufo closer to end game?  Airstrike!!  Wished that for once the damned cops would at least try to shoot at the alien hordes?  Well, lets just say the natives of earth can sometimes be mighty hostile!  Those are just a few of the many small little enhancements to the game!  This game is a must have!			"

												Alot of people love this game because they didn't like xcom 2012 remake and prefered the original. Well I loved xcom 2012, It was my first xcom I didn't play the originals. So if my opinion as a non xcom hipster is revelant to you, read on.To me xcom 2012 and xenonauts are two opposite approaches to a xcom remake.  Which means we have 2 very different games which are great in thier own right. In my mind both have strengths and weaknesses when compared. And if you are a big fan of this tiny genre, then both are worth sinking hours into.The most immediate difference presentation and feel, both games evoke the original in different ways. xenonauts keeps the old school full 2d enviroments and sprites, but opts for more realistic and modern art design. While xcom 2012 goes full 3d modern high quality models and enviroments, and yet its art style is actually more reminiscant of the original, cartoony and a bit daft.To me neither is superior. I prefer fully 3d presentation and destruction of xcom 2012, but prefer the more realistic and grounded art style which is more fitting to a serious game; I prefer xenonaut's chinook and m16s than the kitch skyranger and haircuts of xcom.Xenonauts ground combat is much more similiar to the original, and it frankly just feels very aged and not as tight or fluid as xcom 2012. Having a much bigger squad means generally less need to employ tactics, as each individual is less important. The fire/cover/hunker system in xcom 2012 is genious, xenonauts doesn't require nearly as much decision making on the ground.  You mostly just line up all your guys and fire away, often relying on numbers rather than cover or flanking. One thing xenonaut's ground combat has is that enemies are spawned from the very start, which is miles better than xcom 2012 hugely flawed spawn on LoS system. Overall I have to give ground combat to xcom 2012, but it depends on your own preferences.The place where xenoanuts really shines and becomes WAY superior to xcom 2012 is the geoscape. That is base building/management aswell as air battles. There is simply tons more depth and freedom and is the reason to buy the game. Once you play it makes xcom 2012's geoscape seem totally meaningless.You can directly contoll air battles, your bases will be attacked and you get ground battles to defend them, you can build multiple bases. There is tons of decision making that xcom 2012 lacks, and it's a core part of the game not just a afterthought.So it depends if you want a in depth planetary defense sim, buy xenonauts. If you have no interest in geoscape and only like turn based tactical combat, then stick to xcom 2012 or something else.			"

												I heartily recommend this game once you install several mods:1.  Most important -- the  Xenonauts: Community Edition (X:CE) which is an improved version of the original game, including additional bugfixes and various new features that do not fundamentally alter the intended game experience (rather, they just make it play better).I also used:2.  Skitso's Map Pack3.  Reinforcements4.  Instant Grernades5.  Random Map Pack Artic Collection6.  Random Map Pack Desert Style7.  Khall's More Protraits8.  Khall's Tundra TilesetThe game play is faithful to the original XCOM game.  Your primary concern overall is money.  You must keep nearly all of the countries satisfied and contributing funds or you will lose. Tips on how to keep them satisfied:1.  Destroy alien bases immediately as they are discovered.  2.  Stop terror attacks as soon as they start. 3.  Stop bombing attacks as soon as you can.4.  Shoot down as many UFO's as you can.Radar coverage of the map is key to all these.  I used only three bases, leaving only South America uncovered.  The loss of South America alone is not too damaging to your funds (I completed the game with almost $2 million in hand)  My bases:1.  North Africa.  First base, positioned (coords 4822/1707) so that three radar's coverage included all of the african continent, all of Europe including Great Britain, and extending to east into Indochina and the Soviet Union.2.  North America.  Positioned  (coords 1827/1358) on the North America/Central America border, with radar coverage extending from the artic icecap to cover all of Central America and all of North America with the exception of Alaska.3.  Indochina. Positioned  (coords 4574/1527).  Coverage of all of Indochina, central Soviet Union, and half of Australia.Base contents.North Africa.1.  3 Radars2.  4 Batteries3.  5 Hangers (4 fighters, one troop aircraft)4.  1 Hospital5.  2 Research labs6.  2 Workshops7.  2 Living Spaces8.  1 StoreroomNorth America1.  3 Radars2.  5 Batteries3.  6 Hangers (5 fighters)4.  1 Research lab5.  1 Living SpacesIndochina1.  3 Radars2.  5 Batteries3.  6 Hangers (5 fighters)5.  1 Living SpacesTo build new fighters you transfer one fighter from North Africa to one of the other bases, and then build the new fighter at North Africa.  5 batteries are sufficient to prevent aliens from succeeding in attacking and destroying your bases, so there is no need for soldiers in North America or Indochina.Major Spoilers for Air CombatYou will need to use manual combat for the air once the alien craft get dangerous because you can't afford to lose your aircraft.  Fortunately there is an easy way to do this.  When your fighters intercept the alien craft, always select one of the ""Follow"" options.  After a few seconds you can click on your fighters again, and this time select engage.  Your fighters will appear directly behind the enemy ship.  Turn on all after burners and wait until your craft launch their missles.  Immediately stop the battle and set your craft way points so the they fly behind the enemy craft.  Once they are clear, click on the X to get them to exit the map.Bombers are always escorted by two fighters.  Use two fighters to lure the alien fighters to the east and west.  Have your third fighter move to the tail of one of the alien fighters and shoot it down. Get the second fighter in the same way, then exit.  The bomber will now be an easy kill for another of your flights.Second flights are necessary not only because two are needed for bombers, but also because as the alien craft get bigger and stronger they can not be killed by the six missiles carried by one flight.   Only three fighters can be in one flight, but fortunately each base can put mulitiple flights into the air at once.  Simply click on the UFO and select intercept, and assign three planes to attack.  Then click on the UFO again, and you can assign a second flight to the same UFO.			"

Growing up in Namibia, where at that time internet virtually did not exist, I figured out how to hack the save game files of the original  X-COM with notepad and converting HEX by hand, which allowed me to create a game experience I wanted.Being able to also hack Xenonauts and add all kinds of mods is for me a bonus, as I play for fun, and being able to change the game how I want makes it more fun.

												Less flashy than XCOM but with all the right stuff - I actually prefer it to XCOM, and that's saying a lot. It has all the best parts like the planning, base building, turn based tactics and air combat elements but the best thing for me is the overall feel of the game, its a good take on the alien invasion scenario with enough identity that makes it feel like more than an XCOM clone (like the setting in 1979; seeing the world divided up as Soviet Union, Indochina etc along with troop backstories showing combat experience in Vietnam/Afghanistan and the awesome music makes the game much more immersive). Basically it feels to me like Men In Black 3, MGS3: Snake Eater and XCOM had a love child.I *would* however reccomend watching a couple letsplay videos on youtube if you arent used to XCOM/turn based squad shooters, as a bad first impression can ruin any decent game. That being said the game is more than fair, one of the reasons I prefer it to XCOM is that strategy actually works, as opposed to experiencing ""that's XCOM, baby"" when the RNG decides to f*ck with you. Repeatedly.Tl;dr - a cold war version of XCOM that doesnt need to be flashy to be awesome.			"

												By the time of this review I have played around 40 hours/TLDR: BUY THIS GAME! The game opens with a world map and the ability to place a single base which will give you radar coverage and a few planes. From there your job is to build many bases and cover the landmasses of earth with air protection while sending out your ground teams to clear out alien crashsites and defend cities. It is incredibly deep, from the customization of each soldier which ranks up over time; to the building and upgrading of bases which have much more than just hangars for your different planes. This game also has a much richer gameplay than its more ''AAA'' counterpart XCOM albeit it does have much simpler graphics. Really the only two things that could disuade you from buying it are the retro graphics and the isometric view of the maps. P.S: This game has a huge amount of mod support and a growing mod scene with at least 5 complete mods that change completly the way the game is played and about a 100 smaller mods. It is growing everyday.			"

								If you're like me and enjoyed the original X-Com (UFO Defense) or wanted to, but couldn't handle the 1993 graphics, then I recommend you play Xenonauts.  X-Com veterans will find the geoscape and ground combat very familiar, but with an updated interface, better visuals, and new interesting enemies, lore, and technology trees to research. If you were disappointed by the new X-Com: Enemy Unknown's lack of classic features and gameplay, Xenonauts will not disappoint as it is the closest thing I have ever seen to a modern X-Com.			"

Early Access Review
								All right, first things first; I would say (largely) discount the negative reviews. (Apparently some folks still don't yet understand how the concept of 'Early Access' works.) That being said, if you're the kind of person who might agree with those people, I would wholeheartedly recommend waiting until after development is completed to pick up (or at the very least, play) your own copy of Xenonauts. Goldhawk has been releasing updates with fair regularity, the game has been getting better and more complete each time, and they are currently very close (I'd venture to guess somewhere around 90%, give or take 5% or so) to having the game ready for its final update.Is Xenonauts X-COM? No. (Of course, if you asked me if the most recent X-COM was X-COM, you'd get the same answer. I thought Firaxis did an interesting job with Enemy Unknown, it's just not the X-COM I grew up with.) Again, that being said, Xenonauts is the game that comes closest to emulating the feel of the original X-COM that I have ever seen. There have been many, many, MANY attempts at recapturing that brutal magic over the years; many have been interesting, some even enjoyable, but none that I felt were truly close. You can tell that this game was designed by people who clearly played the original game to death. Put the cosmetic differences aside, and it still *looks* like X-COM, and it *feels* like X-COM. In its raw, unmodified state, the game is difficult - I'd even be willing to say brutally so. (I personally went to the trouble of digging into the data files to give myself a bit of a New Game+, just so I wouldn't lose entire funding regions within the first hour of play. Oh yeah, btw - this game is moddable. The data files are somewhat dense, but with some time and effort, you can modify quite a bit.) The original UFO Defense experience of having troops plasma-blasted to death instantly upon leaving the transport can and does happen. Also included is that feeling of finally having a leg up on the initial alien opponents when you research better weapons and armor - only to have a whole new group of enemies show up and proceed to lay waste to your crack troops with the same level of ease. The UFOs will have an even bigger field day against your interceptors if you let them - they get progressively bigger and nastier and will seem to simply shrug off hits from even your biggest guns.The graphics, while not nearly as rendered and flashy as Enemy Unknown's, are still a huge leg-up from the original game's, and the interface is familiar without being clunky. The game's 1970's Cold War setting actually plays well with the alien invasion theme and helps many of the other design decisions and features to make sense as well. Almost everything that makes up the base of this game has been pulled almost directly from the concepts behind the original UFO Defense, from the basebuilding, tech, and tactical mechanics to the enemies and the weapons. Yes, the UFOs and interceptors look unique and different, there are more types of armor and weapons, and some of the aliens look different and have unique names - but Enemy Unknown did much the same thing, albeit to a lesser extent. Xenonauts really shines in the areas where it makes improvements on the base gameplay from the original game. Air combat in Xenonauts is how air combat in Enemy Unknown should have been - interactive and fully tactical. Just like in the ground combat missions, what happens to your aircraft is entirely on you - make a mistake, and your planes will be shot down, potentially leaving that region of the world defenseless against the next alien attack. Xenonauts also improves on the tactical missions by including local armed forces on the ground combat maps, a genuine cover system, and more transparency in exactly how your troops' physical skills improve at the end of each mission. This game is definitely worth picking up if you are a die-hard fan of old-school X-COM, or if you just like deep, challenging strategy games in general. Oh, and did I mention that you can mod it? Just imagine, an X-COM-like that you can customize to your own liking. Make it easier, make it harder, make it so you can sell alien corpses to museums - whatever you like. It can be done. Remember, with your help, Earth CAN survive the alien invasion! Now get out there and do your part, soldier!			"

												If you're looking for a newer version of the widely renowned original XCOM: UFO Defense, you've come to the right spot! If you've never heard of XCOM, think the original was released in 2012, or came looking for a new strategy game that keeps you on your toes, you've come to the right spot as well! This game successfully meshes turn-based squad combat with a reaserch / funding / air combat strategy layer to keep you thinking about everything you do. I'd heartily reccommend this to anybody with an eye for such games, although be warned, the game is no A to B cakewalk... 9 / 10 I think it's worth $30 personally, but if you're on a tight budget, grab this if it ever goes on sale for $20 or less.I'll assume your read the game description, so I'll spare you the back story and get right down to the gameplay. In the geoscape (the world map view), players control bases and their facilities:  equipping soldiers, researching, manufacturing, managing planes, and managing resources. From here, the goal is mainly to send dropships to crashed / landed ufos or alien bases in order to slow the invasion. The air combat is nice, but not too deep, and is usually resolved based on the tech you have unlocked more than skill (although there are already fancy mods to make this more skill based). These dogfights can be autoresolved if they aren't your bag of tea. The difficulty chosen affects the rate at which the invasion progresses on the geoscape. Although certainly a nice way to progress the game, the geoscape isn't where you spend most of your time.That place would be the battlescape (the turnbased squad combat). This section of the game is incredible. Each unit is given time units to spend on its turn that let it act (all actions require different amounts of TUs) and the remainder of those are used to react to the aliens on their turn. Combat is highly tactical, and the differences in difficulty are most noticed here. The AI is extremely intelligent. The enemy is stronger and heartier than your troops, not to mention extremely intelligent. As the invasion progresses, so will their tech, alien / ufos composition, and numbers. Once killed, soldiers are gone forever, and this gives each firefight a nervous tension (The ironman mode continuously saves your actions to improve this feeling if you enjoy it). Never before has a game made me think so thuroughly during a turn as Xenonauts because of this.The downsides? It's an indie game, so it's not to fancy visually. That said, it still has some incredibly detailed and hand painted sprites. At the time of writing, the game just got out of early access, and it still has one or two bugs two work out. On top of that, some oddities occur due simply to the engine constraints of the game. Beyond that, there really isn't anything to complain about, and my gameplays have been pretty smooth! The game is easily moddable by fiddling with the xml files (doable using notepad), and a nice handful of talented map makers have already begun adding maps to the game. The maps in this game are semi-random, so after multiple playthroughs, you will undoubtably see similar looking maps, and the ones the community makes keeps the game nice and fresh!I trust that if you were an XCOM fan, you'd already have bought this - if not, you should just stop reading and do that. So to all those who have never experienced the thrill of XCOM - the thrill of defending the Earth from an invasion of unknown magnitude and power with technology you prioritized, researched, and manufactured so you could give them to men and women you armed, commanded, and lost - this is a great place to start.

								At this late stage in development, it seems that most of the game is pretty much settled, but they're still working on the balance, so if you want the perfect Xenonauts experience I'd recommend waiting for launch day.Xenonauts is staggeringly good.  It is absolutely a worthy successor to UFO, and far superior to the new XCOM.  If you like this type of game, there's no reason not to buy Xenonauts. "

												  Don't be fooled by the simple looking graphics from the screenshots: few games offer such a great deal of entertainment and deep gameplay as Xenonauts does. If you enjoyed UFO/X-Com as one of the best games of the 90's, then THIS is the remake you always dreamed of. If you didn't play UFO/X-Com, then what are you waiting for? :). None calling himself ""strategy gamer"" should miss it. The guys of Goldhawk Interactive have retained and enhanced the original deep gameplay and excellent progressive flow of game from the original, one of the best all-time game designs.Manage your squads of marines and learn to deal with unwanted casualties; intercept flying UFOS all over the world; research and craft captured technology from crashed or captured UFOs; defend cities and your own bases...A final recommendation: from the start activate the ""Community Edition"" version of the game (easy instructions found on the game launcher). It enhances the gameplay and fixes some minor glitches.And a tip: try to build at least 2 bases from the start ;)			"

												A great remake of the original X-Com.  Use strategy to defend Earth from invading alien ships by building bases, radars, aircraft, and weapons.  The success of your defense efforts determines how well your program is funded as the game progresses.  Research new technology to keep up with the increasing intensity of the invasion, and to understand the aliens' plans.  Secure landing/crash sites of alien ships using your Xenonaut team(s), which plays out in a turn-based tactical style.This game has a lot of deep strategy elements to it and is done in a cool retro art style.  Not graphically the greatest game ever, but it is well executed and has compelling gameplay.			"

												Please do not quit in anger and frustration! Been there, almost uninstalled and moved on. For many people (like myself, more casual gamers, modern XCOM fans, or people just looking to ENJOY a game in this genre), I must highly recommend starting on ""Easy"" difficulty. And on top of that, with mods such as ""Deluxe Geoscape Cheat Mod"", or simply increased funding of some sort. It's worth it. There are at least 50 hours worth of enjoyment to be had, including some fantastic artwork and brilliant writing (detailing everything from ET's to advanced technologies and weapons). Not too bad at all. Looking forward to XENONAUTS 2 soon enough, despite the psychological trauma (thanks Reapers). My rating for XENONAUTS (with mods): 8 out of 10.			"

												As a veteran of X-COM UFO Defense, Terror of the Deep, Apocolypse as well as the more recent remake XCOM Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within, I was very excited to play this.I just finished it on Normal difficulty and I have to say I'm disappointed.While its extremely faithful to the original (UFO Defense) and improves several things which I'll list in a bit, this iteration did not have the same charm as the original. While the finale was abrupt just like the original, it offered even less closure if thats possible. The gameplay was very similar to the original.PROs:-Riot Shields offered new options for troop deployment-Weapon diversification worked very nicely. In the original you could easily get by with everyone just using rifles.-Some UI improvements-Research flavor text was amusingCONs:-Manually controlling the interception portion of the game wasn't fun. I wound up auto-resolving all of them after some time.-Music was atmospheric like the original, but wasn't as good. Some parts were extremely noisy and hard on your ears. Yes its supposed to be unsettling but it was almost painful.-Time period: While an interesting idea I don't think it did enough with the concept. It was basically just a different art style.-Lack of psionic attacks A nice change of pace from the original...but not one I'd play again.What I wanted was just the same X-Com UFO Defense with a better interface, and this failed to meet my expectations.But if you enjoy UFO Defense, theres no reason you won't enjoy this. I'm just disappointed it didn't offer more.6/10			"

												If you're ok with running a whole agency and doing squad based missions this game is for you. If you dont want to manage a bunch of cash, buildings, personnel while inbetween, carefully attacking any alien ships you shoot down to loot them for technology. Then go for something a bit faster paced. This remake has a slower reward system more like the older xcoms than the new ones. As a fan of around 1000 hours of the original Xcoms on floppy disk and finishing my first game (and loss) of this new Xenonauts i can summarise a review of it as: Quite good.  Cons : Clunky UI at times, world map is not always smooth to navigate around.Isometric engine is a bit clunky and cant change angleMaps are not radomised!  unlike in the original (a tiny Xcom coding team accomplished that 20 years ago)Open Xcom (is free) and might be viable within a year (maybe?)Pros:Despite what the devs claim, this certainly is a clone of the original Xcom: UFO defence. And a good one,Music is spooky, the ambient sounds.. are spooky. Artwork, is awesome. The graphics look dated but the style is consistent and feels like you're running a secret agency during the cold war. streamlined features like not having to re-buy ammo for standard issue equipment after each mission you send your poor troops on. Overall:Great remake, makes you think and the game depth gives good immersion if you have the time. Interface is a bit clunky.			"

												The true spiritual successor to the fabled original  UFO: Enemy Unknown from 1994While the recent 3D XCOM: Enemy Unknown by Firaxis was a decent game in itself and has some great ideas it was very limited (Or ""streamlined""), especially in terms of the strategic side of the game where things like base building and base missions were markedly absent (And the scripted one from Enemy Within doesn't count :p ).This game has it all, I cannot see a feature missing from the original game that is not implemented in this one. Think the 1994 version lovingly re-implemented with modern tech and a fun little UFO interception mini-game.There is also some great writing in the research reports etc. which give character to otherwise static screens.Downsides? The graphics are not great (But then you do not care about that do you?) and the tactical map selection can be limited. There is a solution to the second issue in that this game is moddable and there are already map-pack mods out there to increase selection.Im summary: The main thing is... I actually feel like the boss of an organisation dedicated to protecting humanity from the Aliens and making tough decisions rather than a spare tyre like in the recent remake.Massive thumbs up.			"

												Hey, remember X-COM: UFO Defense? Well, Xenonauts is like that. A lot like that, actually. If that sounds appealing, maybe you didn't care for Firaxis' modern interpretation of the series (I did, but eh, you can like what you like) or just want a well-made strategy game that is admittedly unambitious in its aims, then this is exactly what you want. That's not to say that Xenonauts doesn't tweak and modernize certain aspects of the 1994 original, but only in ways that make sense and throw a little more balance into the mix (i.e. no more broken mind control). If you've never played UFO Defense but want something a little more complex than Enemy Unknown, then this wouldn't be a bad place to start. Same brutal taste, but with a little more player freedom and ability to mess around.			"

												This guest review is used by permission of Elethio ""China"" Burton who is one of our few Stardrive approving members.  But that's Ok as diversity is the spice of life.  And regardless of that China and I agree that Xenonauts is a great game and the closest thing to the original XCOM: UFO DEFENCE  we've found.  We've both been playing that since it first came out.  Thanks for being generous in sharing this with us China.This review has a rare 100% approval rating by the way.Recommended66.3 hrs on recordFollows the Xcom1 very closelyYes! at last a game that does it right, a worthy succesor to the origional Xcom.Its at least as hard as Xcom1, maybe harderBe warned though, even if your an Xcom pro this game is tough, I'm good at Xcom player but after 4/5 failed attempts at this on ""veteran"" I had to start playing it on ""normal"".It has some differences, but you will be glad.Despite following the origional game closely, for most of its mechanics, Xenonauts does make some minor changes that improve thinngs, stores are less of a chore (many items like ammo and standard wepaons are free and infinite), intercepts are more important and more fun, funding is more important (the old exploits won't work here).Also you will generally have to develop new strategies to win.Obviously the story is different and the techs and the style, but they are all still enthralling and brilliantly done.Just buy this now.Honestly, I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this game... although the head scientist is so obnoxious you will want to punch him, but I think that's deliberate.

												Tactical turn-based squad combat within spitting distance of its finest.The upsides:The time unit system, inspired by the original X-COM. If your soldiers are fast, they can shoot their weapon several times, then run. Or shoot and move and shoot again.The overwatch system. You just point your soldiers in the right direction and leave them some time units, and they'll shoot reactively when they see something.Research. This could be better integrated, but the basic idea is that you need to acquire specific alien technology to study and thereby improve your equipment.Difficulty levels. I'm playing on easy right now, and it is in fact easy. A small challenge in places, but if I'm a bit careful, I don't lose soldiers. Higher difficulty levels are progressively harder and require more care to get through.The midsides:Enemy variety is okay. You've got normal mooks, regenerating enemies, androids, reavers (scary), fliers, and psions (also scary). Enough to keep you on your toes, but I rarely see much difference between androids and baseline Caesians.Weapon variety is a strict progression on one axis, with different purposes on another. Shotgun to scatter laser, for instance; rifle to laser rifle to plasma rifle. Armor progression is similar at first, but branches out a bit later, letting you choose between medium armor, flying scout armor, and walking tanks. The variety is just sufficient, no more.The controls are mostly intuitive -- but who thinks about controls unless they're bad?There's a decent number of maps, but you'll start recognizing them after a bit. For standard missions, I think there's like industrial, city, arctic, farmland, and desert, with about three maps each. That means you've got good odds of seeing a duplicate after just a few missions. And terror missions always take place in a city. Enemy bases have more variety, but you're not likely to see that many alien bases. I would have liked to see procedurally generated terrain, but that's difficult and time-consuming to create.The downsides:The UI is a little clunky for switching between levels (upstairs/downstairs).There are occasional bugs -- the other day, I encountered a ghost Caesian. It wasn't aligned on tile boundaries, my soldiers could overlap it, and I couldn't shoot it. I had to run away. There are occasional crashes, too. Not quite stable enough for me to recommend ironman mode.It's somewhat expected in this kind of game, but losses can snowball. You spent a lot of time building up your forces, then got a full team wipe and lost half your equipment in a bad mission. At that point, you should maybe scrub the campaign and start over. You research things in the wrong order and things get a lot more difficult than they would otherwise be.			"

												Gist of the game:Build air bases around the world to try to achieve air supremecy over nations so they continue to fund you.Recruit and equip ground troops to investigate crash sites, enemy bases, and alien terror attacks.Perform research and to learn about the aliens and build new advanced planes and battlefield support equipment (guns/tanks/armor)Manage budget and upkeep over investments in winning on the battlefield VS winning in the air.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What got me to recommend the gmae:I. Ground combat feels dynamic;Alien got your squad penned down? Blast a hole in the wall with c4 and flank him!Use machine gunners and flash grenades to suppress enemies.Use anti-ballistic shield to make an assault on an alien UFO.Do you toss c4 and rockets into the UFO to soften up the enemy or do you go in without the explosives in order to salvage alien items?One wrong turn (the ground combat is turned based) in which you leave soldiers exposed in the open leaves the possibility that one alien machine gunner can mow down half your squad.Many different kinds of grenades with different uses.Fight a diverse variety (but not excessive) of aliens.II. Somewhat dynamic air battlesjust go watch a youtube video for this one.The air battles are fun but sometimes very repetitive. III. DifficultyI like the difficulty a lot. The game has 4 options I believe: easy, normal, hard, insane.I play on normal and it is very much a fun challenge. I have to do a lot of thinking. Overall:I predict this game is an instant classic and will be played long after its release for many years.9.5/10i put 9.5 instead of 10 because I think multiplayer ground combat would be really awesome and I think air combat is neat however it maybe could have been done better			"

												If you are a fan of the original UFO:Enemy Unknown (AKA X-Com:UFO Defence), then know that I used to play it from time to time until 2013, when I found Xenonauts, and since then I can't really play the original game anymore. The simplest way to describe Xenonauts is that it keeps the spirit of the original game and adds many improvements.If the only game related to X-Com games you know is Firaxis XCOM, then know that XCOM doesn't really have much in common with the original game, despite the name, as at the core they are fundamentally different games. Asking which one is better is like asking whether apples or steaks taste better - some will like one better, some the other, and some will like both while knowing that they are simply different. And the same applies to XCOM and Xenonauts, they are different, and whatever you learn when playing XCOM is best to forget when playing Xenonauts. XCOM is like a Hollywood action move: It's flashy, with explosions, brave superheroes who eventually defeat the aliens with style while uttering their lines, avenging their fallen mates who the aliens had the nerves to inevitably kill early on. And if you like action movies, it doesn't really matter that it's cliched, gamey, doesn't often make much sense, and is hardly ""Enemy Unknown"" when somebody pops up to explain everything three times the moment you encounter something new. Xenonauts is like a thriller: You don't really know what is going on, and may get lost if you don't pay attention, or may figure it out only later. Things start in a miserable situation, the aliens keep their pressure until the very end, people die when mistakes are made and sometimes even if not and they are merely unlucky. The war is all but lost and hopeless, but it has to be fought, because there's no option and it may be won despite all the losses and setbacks. And that is exactly one of the charm's of Xenonauts - anyone can win a fight that is meant to be won, but it's an entirely different matter if the victory is not given away merely for a pretense of effort, and aliens in Xenonauts do not show up to be just target practice. In Xenonauts, you have to deserve your victory, and the game won't hesitate to utterly defeat you if you fail to deliver. But if you do win, then it is the sweetest of victories, because it was you that made it happen despite everything. And it doesn't matter that there were no cutscenes, because the best story was inside your head.And if you have never heard of any X-Com or XCOM for whatever strange reason, then know that Xenonauts is a great game, but it is not a game for everybody. If you expect casual play, you'll lose quickly. If you judge a book by its cover, you'll be disappointed by the lack of cutscenes or flashy graphics. If concepts such as ""planes with only heavy missiles can't win against nimble fighter UFOs"", ""soldiers in the open are likely to die"", ""aliens may attack from behind if that area has not been checked"", ""humans do not see well in the dark"", ""items need to be in hands in order to be used"" or ""your mouse has more than one button"" remain a mystery to you, the game will end up being frustrating and ""confusing"", as there is no tutorial and the game does not spoon-feed information to the player, but rather just provides the information and expects the player to figure it out (or there's of course the manual, but it's 2010s, so nowadays it's much cooler to spend an hour on trial and error rather than skimming over a manual for a couple of minutes). But if you think about what happens, pay attention, are relentless and careful, and like to win because you are good, then this is a game for you.In Xenonauts, aliens will keep you on the edge for a long time (unlike in X-Com, where it felt more like the aliens were just occassionally stopping by, and they will not wait forever until you research your next ""priority"" project as in XCOM). You will need to quickly manage setting up additional bases around the globe (wherever you want), expand your air force to hunt flying UFOs (and you really need to hunt them), research new technologies to try to keep up, manage your funds (which may soon get low if the funding regions decide you do a lousy job of defending them), and last but definitely not the least, equip and lead your soldiers to fight ground missions at downed UFOs, cities terrorized by aliens, alien bases (yes, plural) and defences of your own bases (yes, again, not necessarily just once) until the very end. Which, for many soldiers, may be their own personnal end, given they fight a superior enemy, and it is expected for soldiers to die throughout the entire game. Your soldiers have a selection of different equipment available to them, and it is up to you to choose it based on their strengths and weaknesses, and create tactics that will fit your style (there is no perks system giving soldiers ""magic"" abilities as in XCOM, it is the equipment and the ability to freely combine it that provide variety). And it is up to you to balance all of that.No game is perfect, of course. First of all, I suggest you consider using the Community Edition, which provides additional bugfixes, tweaks and mods that alleviate some of the problems you might have with the vanilla game (such as a relatively low number of maps). As said, there's no tutorial, so you need to either figure it out using common sense and information in the game (Xenopedia, tooltips), at least glance at the manual, or watch a (good) YouTube video. The game is quite long, so it may feel a bit repetitive if you try to finish it quickly (but there are airstrikes to help with that). You may also easily end up in a death spiral if you do poorly (but then you shouldn't do way too poorly, it either means that you are too careless and do not pay attention, or you should play on easier difficulty). The alien AI is probably the smartest I have ever seen in any X-Com game (in other games they often just wait or wander aimlessly), which may prove annoying if you do not expect that: Alien leaders will often take defensive positions (here the aliens actually care about their UFO) and mindless attacks will often end up in a carnage, and occassionally the aliens are way too smart (the aliens do not cheat as such, but generally smart AIs are hard to do without the AI getting access to internal information, and even though it usually makes the game better, in some cases it may tip the scales of the AI's decision making into doing the unlikely). Finally, the grid structure of the battlefield leads to some unintuitive (even though not buggy) line-of-sight/fire issues, for example round shapes such as UFO hull are rather poorly mapped to the grid.But none of that matters much if you immerse yourself into the game and let it to scare you during night and terror missions, to make you feel overwhelmed in desperate fights, to get shocked when your soldiers die, to organize your force the way you want and make progress in the hopes of overcoming the enemy, and to let you feel the joy when you make that happen.All in all, if you like X-Com games, or if you like games that actually challenge you, this is a game for you.(Note that I do not use Steam for launching the game, so the number of hours played is way way off. I've probably spent few hundred hours on just playing the game, and since the game has hooked me enough to make me contribute to the Community Edition, I'm probably past a thousand.)			"

								Hello good friend Xenonauts! If you like XCOM Series you should try out the classical Modernized 80s-90s Alien invasion! i say i enjoy this game alot as it's simple and good spirited, It's intense and scary as XCOM in many ways and could say it's MORE punishing and lasts ALOT longer, I honestly haven't finished the game so i might be wrong in alot what i say, But i enjoy this game for allowing me to do whatever the flurck i want, Shoot down ships, Small or big, Fail horridly, Capture aliens with my Spam of gas grenades ""♥♥♥♥ing love you for adding Capture through gas grenades, How about wine?"" And other tools to get you through the encounters.Things are scary and unknown in the early age of this invasion, you are still advancing in the old tech of our past time, You suffer and will have big losses due to the sole fact that they are alinens with pure energy based weapons and you with puny yet reliable ballistic weapons.Get this game and give it a try, It's really fun and lasts long.Again like XCOM you can modify this game aswell to suit more things you'd like, More UFO's, more encounters or attacks or even aliens, funding, research, parts or materials, it's all harmless to the indevidual person, You are playing as you want, Even if other thinks you cheat or not, Your game, Your modificatons, beside it's a single player game, blood have fun.

												Xenonauts started development before XCOM: Enemy Unknown was even announced to the public. It aimed to be a modern day remake of the original 'XCOM: UFO Defense', also know as 'UFO: Enemy Unknown' in Europe.Xenonauts has stayed true to the original, plus expanded on it. Everything that was great about the original XCOM is here and even better. The UI is very nice and clean, Air and Ground Combat both feel great, and base/research/production management is very fun as well.Edit 1: Now that the game is released, I can finish this review. From when I first made this review, there's been quite a few changes and much balancing, which made an already fun TBS even more so. My only real complaint is that the soldiers stat generation has had its minimum lowered, so when starting a new game or recruiting a new soldier, you often get soldiers with annoyingly low Time Units(TU for short).The only saving grace is that they changed how much TU's shooting costs. Instead of a flat number, it's a percentage of their max TU's. This means that no matter how few TU's you have, you can still rally off as many shots as a high TU character. However, movement TU cost is still a flat number, so low TU will greatly restrict how far you can go, and if you want to shoot and move, you'll have a hard time with low TU's.They also nerfed some of the armor and the shield. The shield is the biggest in my opinion. I used to love having two soldiers with shields, but with its small nerf, they start to become a liability far sooner than before. There IS a shield upgrade, but you get that option LONG after the first shield becomes a liability. Doesn't help that they nerfed the pistol pretty hard too.With the release version I tend to drop the shield pretty quickly, and I rarely use the pistol due to its poor accuracy and range.Anyway, enough with complaining. Despite the whining, this game is still incredible. If you like XCOM and/or Turn Based Strategy games, then this is definitely a game you'll need to pick up.Edit 2: I made a mistake in the first paragraph. Xenonauts was not announced before XCOM: Enemy Unknown.			"

Early Access Review
								[Edit] Just started playing the release version (1.0), and it`s really awesome [end of edit]I enjoyed Fallout 1,2 and tactics in it`s day, spent a few hundred hours on Jagged Alliance 2 (still an amazing game to play now). That being said, Xenonauts is an awesome love game that is just satisfying to discover and strategize with; The game does a great job at simulation what I see as key elements in defending Earth; At this time the game is still in Beta, I played version 19 stable, a few months (hopefuly) before release. I fully recomend purchasing this game even if it never develops beyond this stage, you will get your entertainment`s worth if you like this genre(I played more hours of this than Diablo 3); (but it`s being built very fast and very nicely so don`t wory about not being developed);Now, if you never played any of the titles writen before, but want to tryout this ""turn Base"" simulation thing, I recomend you search 1 2 youtube videos to be sure the art style, animation, and isometric perspective is something you like; It`s not a big budget AAA title, and they made a clear choice to invest a lot in gameplay and replayability rather than eye candy; If you`re coming here out of the latest Firaxis X-com titles, I recomend you really give it a try! you may sometimes miss the flashy animation, awesome explosions and gorry deaths, but the strategy is much more seducing!Good luck defending earth!

												A wonderfully well made remake of the original X-com: enemy unknown.Apart from some minor UI grievances this is a very solid squad based tactical figting game. The maps are varied enough to not feel like too much of a repeat (especially compared to Firaxis' remake, where you constantly fight on exactly the same maps).One jewel, that I feel immensely improves this game compared to the original is the introduction of the shield units (a person who carries a heavy shield and therefore can carry almost nothinng but a hand gun). It makes those ""what is hiding around the next corner""- and ""breaching the spaceship""-situations so much less random since you have troops designed to soak a bit of damage.Very recommendable.

												This is honestly what I expected the X-Com remake to be, and was disappointed that I didn't get. It's a tasteful homage to the originals, with an art direction all its own. The developers have obviously put a lot of thought into making a beautiful and fun game. I like it a lot 11 hours in, and I can see myself sinking 40 more into it. ""Meh"" things:The combat is a bit simpler than I like in my TBS games. I feel like they could have worked in more complexity to movement/posture/aiming (like JA2 did), and come out with a more engaging, tactical game. However, it's still a step up from the remade X-Com, so I won't nitpick here too much.The maps feel a bit same-y after a few battles (crashed spaceships are generally in the same location relative to your skyranger).Don't be dissuaded, though - this is good stuff. 7/10 or so.

												I was hoping to extend my XCOM 2012 experience with xenonauts....well, I was pretty wrong. It's better under some aspects (the air battles are better developed, the story seems more interesting, the base management is greater and better designed) but...ground battles just suck. And that's the bigger point in that kind of games. Weird things happen so often that, in the end, you'll just lose interest. Let's just tell about what's wrong :1) LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG "" WAITING FOR I.A. "" !! Seriously, the waiting at the end of each turn is much, much, much longer than the loading times !! and this "" Hidden movement "" artwork image is, after a while, worst than just looking at the map...2) big map and lot enemies...it isn't a good thing ? well, no, most match, especially during the terror missions, will ends up with you searching for some single xeno running away...add this to the point 1) and...you'll know about those stolen and frustating 5-10 minutes !!! 3) despite the lore, even the aliens that should have a "" worst vision than human "" can still see you while you cannot, even when you're facing their direction e.g. you'll be shooted from nowhere and you can do few about this4) the black fog of war outside the buildings is boring and make no sense. WTF, they don't scout the area at least while approaching with the dropshp ?5) you cannot throw granades over a small wall but the aliens can.			"

												I never played the original XCOM; despite that, I love the genre, and played more Fallout Tactics and Chaos Gate than I care to think about, as well as more modern games like Silent Storm. This is to say that I'm viewing Xenonauts on its own merits and not colored by any association with its spiritual predecessor.There's a lot to like here, and some parts of this game I'm really fond of. I like the setting, with retooled F-16s and MiGs giving things vague Independence Day vibes. The strategic game is fun, establishing bases, managing personnel and research projects, and dispatching interceptors to engage UFOs. Some might find the micromanagement of every soldier and every F-16 a little fiddly, but I enjoy it. The overall atmosphere is intriguing and the basic premise of defending Earth from alien scum is a classic.Unfortunately, that's where the good ends. Manual air combat is lackluster, feeling unresponsive and offering few options other than to bring more firepower to the table and win the resulting slugging match. This is only a minor complaint, however, as it serves its purpose and air combats can be autoresolved if one wishes.Ground combat is where I was truly disappointed. Again, I don't care if it's ""faithful"" to a 1994 game or not, this game came out in 2014 and those are the standards I hold it to. At first glance, it seemed a little reminiscent of Silent Storm, with action points (TUs) and Snap Shots, Aimed Shots, Bursts, etc. It lacks Silent Storm's depth, however, and yet also somehow manages to exacerbate Silent Storm's worst flaws of unfathomable line-of-sight/vision/detection rules, a tedious RNG overwatch system, and an AI which knows just how to exploit both to maximize player frustration. Added to this is a downright awful movement system, which punishes you for any kind of movement and making many tactical maneuvers virtually impossible.My favorite moment thus far is when I was stacked up to assault a downed UFO's cockpit. Because of the frustratingly punishing movement/TU limitations, only my two soldiers immediately on either side of the door had enough movement to open the cockpit doors, run inside, and still get a shot off at the occupants (grenading was impossible, both because of the way the doors were set up and the even MORE punishing TU requirements for grenades). I had to make sure they ended their turn at the doors in order to get a full turn's movement the next turn, meanwhile, the rest of the squad covered the door from behind cover elsewhere. So, naturally, during the AI turn the aliens pop out of the cockpit to take a shot and then pop back in, Silent Storm style. During one of these, one of my guys gets an RNG interrupt - which I have no control over - and unloads his machinegun... directly into one of my stacked-up assaulters, despite being BESIDE the door, out of the line of fire! KIA.Maybe the game is going for some kind of wacky ""Haha, see how many hapless idiots you can turn into cannon fodder"" theme, but the detailed service records explaining that my soldiers are Soviet VDV or British SAS with combat experience in Northern Ireland seems to undermine the notion that my soldiers are supposed to be high-mortality idiots intended to be thrown at the aliens like disposable meat shields.I like that the strategic layer and overall atmosphere of the game are so much deeper and more intricate than the new XCOM, but the tactical gameplay is so painfully backward that it drains any real fun from the experience. Masochists and 1994 nostalgists might get a kick out of it, but anyone else is advised to just go reinstall Fallout Tactics or Silent Storm instead.			"

												Awesome!  Xenonauts is an incredibly clever and rewarding game. Great game mechanics, streamlined micro-management and wonderful  60's type of artwork.Tough strategic and economic decisions await you:  should you build one more base to save Australia or improve your existing ones?  Hire more soldiers or modernize your jets?  The combats are very,  very challenging:  if you rush,  the aliens will wipe out your best teams, those it took you weeks to promote to majors. And you will lose money, and you will lose continents.  On the down size, the repetitive, corridor style combats in the alien bases. Superior to the XCom series, which has its own merits,  Xenonauts is the proof that you do not need 3D or fluffy animations to create an enthralling and wonderful game. Oh, and I love the map and the passing of time idea!			"

Posted: June 18, 2014
												I don't see any ""non-early-access"" reviews of Xenonauts down below, so I figured I should put one up.  I don't review things normally, but I find this game interesting enough to do one regardless.  I won't arbitrarily assign number values, I'll should post my thoughts on a few areas.  My review is mostly based on comparisons with other games in the genre, so to speak.To help you all learn what I am talking about, XCOM refers to the recent Firaxis game, while X-Com refers to the significantly older Microprose game that inspired both this and XCOM.Looks:  I imagine that most people today might be taken back by the ""cheap"" 2d graphics and general lack of flashy-ness.  You need to realize that the simple ui and graphics really help make the game look clean for modern audiences, while maintaining the feel of the original X-Com.  The UI does a remarkably good job at allowing you to understand what is going on (which I think is the worst way that the original X-Com has aged).  The game also has a decent variety of environments to look at, which helps evoke the sense of a global war as you battle among the ruins of downed UFOs from Middle-Eastern deserts to downtown Edinburgh.  That said, the graphics often seemed underwhelming when compared to the action taking place (something that XCOM did a great job of fixing I think).  This is a minor gripe though, and the graphics in the game do a great job of letting you know what's going on while giving a good sense of the era the game takes place in.Gameplay:  Being someone who has played a great deal of both X-Com and XCOM, Xenonauts does a great job of ""fixing"" a lot of the things that were broken about the original game.  One my biggest gripes while playing through XCOM is that while it was fun, I never really felt the same sense of horror that X-Com inspired.  Instead, I felt that I had a squad of colorful (literally) superheroes out of an action movie kicking alien♥♥♥♥♥  While that's a blast, it is quite different from the creepy atmosphere and balls-breaking difficult gameplay of the original (and yes, I have played XCOM on difficulty levels higher than Normal).  For me, Xenonauts captured the utter feeling of terror that the original had in the tactical game.  It also fixes a lot of the dumb micromanaging of the original (like having to re-equip soldiers for each mission), as well as making certain tactics unnecessary (you no longer have to send suicide rookies through doors because you can open them finally!).  They also added in a second victory option on the tactical map, where you only need to hold a UFO for a certain amount of time before winning, which eliminates the need to go on those time consuming hunts for the lone alien cowering in a corner somewhere (which you can still do if you really want to).  Xenonauts also brings back X-Com's basebuilding and geoscape game, as well as (I found at least), vastly improving the interceptions.  Finally, they added in the very nice option of simply authorizing airstrikes against downed UFOs instead of sending in the grunts, which makes the game feel much less dumb at moments.  If you are a fan of X-Com, be warned about a number of changes they made though.  In order to make you reliant on council funding, they removed the efficiency with which you could produce and sell items for cash.  I believe they also removed many of the end-game options that make enemies irrelevant (such as blaster-bombs), although I could be wrong since I have not played this enough to say for certain.  If you are neither of those groups and this is just something on the front page of steam, this game uses an adjustable speed real-time global strategy map where you plop down new bases and send interceptors and strike squads as you try to save the earth from a massive alien invasion in the 1970's.  When intercepting UFOs, your fighters can either autoresolve the battle or you can command a quick realtime interception minigame.  When you send choppers full of your troopers to take downed UFOs, the game switches to being a squad-based, turn-based tactics game.  The goal initially is to just find out about the aliens and get the weapons that can take them down, all while surviving the invasion, and the gameplay does a pretty good job of making you feel that.  If you haven't played any game related to this one, you might find it difficult to figure out what everything means and how to play, but I might put a total noob's guide or something soon to help those in that boat.Price:  I know many of are looking at that price and saying that the game can't possibly be worth it.  $25 for a 2d game that is basically a clone of a game that has already been cloned?  MADNESS!  If you are on of those types of people, I imagine you also seldom buy any game that doesn't seem like a sweet deal to grab, so just wait for a sale if it seems to strike your fancy.  If you like XCOM or X-Com, this game is different or better (respectively) enough for you to probably enjoy it.  If you don't mind throwing down the dosh for the game right now, I can tell you that as a fan and owner of both X-Com and XCOM, this game is a great addition to the collection.  Since it changes a lot of issues that X-Com has while remaining in its style, it feels nicely different from XCOM and just superior to X-Com.  If you own neither of those games, this is still a great game in its own right.  It's also one of the few games in recent memory that hasn't hit me with buyer's remorse.Conclusion:  Xenonauts is really different from XCOM, since it plays much more like X-Com.  At the same time, it really improves on the old X-Com formula, making it worthwhile that way.  It might look a little weird, and if you aren't used to it, it will likely feel incomprehensible, but it isn't impossible to figure out what is going on.  If youa re interested in the premise, I think it does a great job of executing on that front (much more so than X-Com ever did).  If you don't normally buy games at full price, wait for a sale to hit like you always do anyways, but if you don't mind it, this game is worth the full price in my book.			"

												A tactically sound XCOMXenonauts is a great squad-based strategy game. I found out about it around the time XCOM was really hyped and it had great potential while in Beta. It is also closer to what the original games were from what I have seen and been told. The game became a basis for a lot well-made mods that got the game to the level of quality that I could recommend the game without any doubts. One of the great aspects of the game is that while the progression of the invasion will develop in a straightforward manner, the success and ways you will be able to resist it can be very different depending on the decisions you have made of how to spread your limited resources and how successful you have been with downing UFOs and killing aliens on the ground.The element of randomness and unexpected development in the invasion is what really makes this game addictive and repayable. You constantly have to adjust and prepare in advance for new threats and improve the defence of the planet. The game does not lead the player as a child and you are often forced to adapt the best way you find possible which is often not very effective. This fits well into the setting as no one has ever experienced an alien invasion, so you can’t expect someone to tell you how to deal with it. However, this can result in the need to start a new play through when you realise that you have fallen too far behind, but I didn’t mind it as I enjoyed the game greatly and had to abandon only my first play through because I was playing it as if I was playing XCOM: EUThe gameplay is divided in three parts: the world map, where you track UFOs and manage your bases, soldiers and interceptors; the air fights where you actually control the interceptors and fight the UFOs; and the missions on the ground where most of the time you fight what’s left of the UFO’s crew. The world map is well-made and has all the necessary functionality like patrolling the skies and setting a course for the interceptors. The air battles can be tedious and annoying when you do not know how to deal with the UFOs yet. Finally, the ground battles are what really make the game great and are the essence of it. They take place on a random map (randomly generated with some mods) and they can have different objectives. Unlike the simplified battle in XCOM, here every action takes Action Points, from shooting to looking around. Reaction fire is based on how many APs your squad member has and everything fits really well and the flow of the battle feels really ‘organic’ while in XCOM you have to select it as a separate action, your inventory is limited to slots and squads are based on specialisation. In Xenonauts inventories are only limited by a RPG-style grid and the strength of the character. Also, you decide the class depending on the stats. If the character has enough strength you can give him an RPG as well as a machine gun and a sniper rifle. The feasibility of that is limited but you can play around with different loadouts. This shows that the approach taken in creating this game relies on giving the player the freedom to make decisions and learn for himself what the best approach is.The graphics are satisfactory, however the 2-d engine can lead to some unlikely shot trajectory and unbelievable deaths which can be frustrating. I am glad the next game is coming on a 3-d engine.Lastly, I will give a few hints for new players. Get the community version straight away. The instructions are on the official forum. It makes the game what it was supposed to be in the first place. Start the game on normal and learn how to play there. You will end up having to start a new game eventually so used that to see the pace at which the game becomes harder. Once you lose hope during that play through start a new one on Veteran because there the aliens are not nerfed and will have 100% stats which to me it seems is how the game is supposed to be played. I can’t suggest switching Iron Man mode on but you should play the game as if you have it on and suffer the consequences because that is what makes the game interesting. Only replay things if you believe the game has been very unjust to you, as these moments will take place. If you are not used to the air battles check youtube for a guide as this is of crucial importance for your success. Happy alien hunting!			"

												It's a winner. Doesn't even slightly joke about being a better version of the groundbreaking classic that was Ufo Defense (or X-com, depending where you're from)It takes all the good things from that and innovates on them, making it a better version of itself. Currently as of writing this, there's still a tiny few bugs around, but no gamebreaking ones and judging from the awesome support for the mod community so far, this one is gonna go long, and stay high up for a very long time.If you've never had the chance to play the original X-com, this is your shot, and highly reccomended at that.

								9/10This is what the most recent XCOM game should've been - a turn-based, squad-focused tactical game with a good strategic layer. Not that XCOM wasn't good, but that's an entirely seperate review. The game plays like an updated original UFO game, and this game is a must-buy if you loved those games. Excellent replayability.Deducted a point because some of the missions/maps are quite repetitive, given enough time.			"

												It plays like X-COM without being a direct copy of X-COM.  Xenonauts offers you a lot more in the way of tactical planning and decision making, while still leaving room for you to fall into your own pattern and strategy for successful missions.  The variety of weapons is a huge upgrade from X-COM's typical Pistol/Rifle/Heavy weapon, and the balance between the weapons is pretty spot-on; you can use whatever you like, provided you plan accordingly, a strike team of pure pistol-wielding xenonauts is totally viable.  The research text is flavorful and a nice addition, immersing you more in the world and the reality of the invasion while still offering some form of believability.  The geoscape is far more lively, with alien activity being broadcasted as ""casualty reports"" around the globe when left unchecked, and rather than a single UFO or a few on the same mission appearing, you get swarms of UFOs appearing all over the globe simultaneously, each operating on its own agenda.  This makes having a competent airforce not a luxury but a necessity. While the game is far from perfect, it still gave me literal days of playtime fun, along with a few agonizing losses and times of near rage-quitting.  Definitely a must play if you enjoyed any of the X-COM games, including the newer reboot.Just remember to close the door before you end your turn and keep your eyes peeled for reapers.			"

												Originally, my biggest fear for Xenonauts was that it was shaping up to be inspired so heavily by the original X-Com that it was going to be a carbon copy with slightly shinier graphics and a few little adjustments here and there. And I was exactly right. However, now some weeks after release, my biggest fear has somewhat shifted: I’m now very concerned that I can’t drag myself away from the game long enough to finish this review.Full Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12323/pc/xenonauts/review.html "

								Everything that the original X-Com was and better. Down to the UFOapedia the detail and love for it's inspiration is obvious. Playing the early access now and the game is great. A few missing pictures and the score screen post battle is incomplete but nothing that affects gameplay. Well done. i would give a perfict score if they had been a tad more original in the technology routes and deviated from X-com more but this is a minor gripe. 9 of 10, maybe a 10 of 10 after release.

												Back in the dark ages I found a demo of X-com for my newly cobbled together 486. I wore that demo out. Even though the demo only contained one map I was able to get hours and hours out of it due to the high difficulty and the complete lack of any tool tips or tutorial. Some decade later X-com got a reboot which was massively dissapointing to me. Discovering Xenonauts was like finding that girl from junor high who gave you your 1st kiss then lost track of in highschool, has grown up into a hottie who makes pizza from cratch and cuban sandwiches while wearing heels and an apron (also she regards you as her 1st love).  Xenonauts is what X-com's re-boot should have been. Big studio AAA titles are falling into the same trap that hollowood blockbusters have. The cost of production is so high that risky ideas (read as good ideas) get a pass for more tried and true formulas (I'm looking at you infinity sequal titles). I guess a bunch of younger folks who never played the insanely hard original may try Xenonauts because they loved the re-boot. Most of those people will probably hate this game. They are going to die and die and die and not understand the satisfaction of keeping an entire team of veterans alive or the dread of losing an old friend. Xenonauts for what is it, and how it was dev, is 10/10. It's not just a carbon copy of old x-com, it's better in all the right ways without losing any of the exacting tactical nature of the original. The coldwar setting is sick and adds immersion for me (I'm a grey bush who remembers the end of the cold war). The writing is great and combined with the art really draws you in and  adds depth and flavor, yet can be completely ignored if nobody got time for that and just want to grind out another mission real quick. In fact lots of things in this game can be sorta glossed over or invested in as the particular player sees fit. This is what I love most about this game. You are free to solve this puzzel however you want. Some players are going to master dog fighting and some folks will auto calculate every air battle. Some may read every bit of flavor text in the game and soak up all the small details, and others will have eyes for ruthless ground games only. Whatever you find enjoyable you can go deeper and whatever you don't enjoy, you can dial down and not have to go down that road.			"

												This an interesting strategy game, with a RNG system that can be irritating at times. The most broken thing in the game is the aliens ability to mindcontrole one of the members in your team. This destroys every decent strategy. The only way to get around this is to save and load all the time. Otherwise this is an interesting game, it might be a little bit of a ripoff though...			"

Posted: February 4, 2016
												Full disclosure: I'm writing this review from the POV of someone who's certainly heard of but never played any of the Xcom games before starting this one.Xenonauts is a strategy game where you command the titular international military group tasked with defending Earth from alien invasion in the late 1970s. It's supposed to be a remake of the original X-Com set during the Cold War, and as far as I know it's a pretty faithful recreation right down to the battlefield, base placement and troop equipment micromanagement. It seems deeper than, say, the newer XCOM series, not that that would make the newer games bad.For me personally, it feels more like a classic Doctor Who serial without the Doctor or indeed almost any sense of optimism. (It doesn't really take advantage the fact that it's set during the Cold War - often you'll have NATO and Warsaw Pact soldiers working together in the same squad.) This game can be pretty brutal at times. The only thing that will save you from the nasty, aggressive aliens is attacking them wherever possible with maximum firepower, then stealing their stuff so your scientists can reverse-engineer it into even more firepower.I quite like it myself, and it's an impressive indie effort, so I'd say it's good, but given its problems I would only call it good. Let's hope the sequel[www.xenonauts2.com] will be great.My other observations:Air combat is ""aces"", perhaps the best expansion over the original X-Com, though it's 3v3 max and takes some getting used to. Make sure you don't insta-deploy to the first sight of UFO activity before formulating some sort of tactic for the situation, and make sure you know your aircrafts' limits before sending them out to fight.Breaching downed alien ships can become tedious - the devs should have added back doors, side entrances and/or destructible hull points to at least some of them. You pretty much need explosives, shields and/or expendable soldiers because at least some of the aliens will have holed up inside and they will shoot the hell out of your troops.To my understanding, the original X-Com eventually gave you tools to counter psionic attacks and develop your own. Xenonauts doesn't seem to give you anything of the sort except letting your braver troops/those who survived previous psychic attacks resist them more effectively.Bullet trajectories aren't really modeled past your units' line of sight, from what I can tell. If you fire on where you know an alien is, but the alien is out of your LOS, it won't do anything unless you use projectile weapons such as rockets.Lines of sight themselves can be weird. Soldiers seem to have a difficult time throwing grenades over objects, but alien forces seem to be able to see your forces often before you can see them.Workshop support is truly this game's saving grace. There's already a number of mods that try to fix what I've described above.I would say this is a rather rough but ultimately enjoyable game for people who want a no-holds-barred slugfest with MiGs and M16s against invading aliens. It's certainly smoother around the edges for people who don't want to play the original, which is more than 20 years old at this point. It also seems more grim in tone than the original, but that could be just me.The prequel novella included with the game is good, at least.Two tips. Alien activity is punishing here, since they love to screw with humanity and since every violent act you fail to stop drains your support and therefore funding - this means air superiority is key. Get at least 3 bases up ASAP and make sure they cover at least a decent portion of the map. On that note, MiGs and enhanced torpedoes are some of the most important research projects in the earlygame, followed shortly by dropship tech. You can usually pick and choose where to send in the troops, but you need to be able to match your enemy in the air war ASAP. Noticing a pattern here?Also, ground combat is usually challenging to the point where you want to avoid night missions until the lategame, and start avoiding industrial areas around the midgame. Automatic weapons in close quarters and dangerous enemy types that run up in your face mean things will get very messy. Of course, if that's what you want, don't let me stop you from staging Stalingrad With Aliens.			"

												An UFO / XCom remake, it's very addictive!Is it better than the new XCom Ennemy unknown ? Yes, definatly. XCom EU is decent. But Xenonauts has a much deeper gameplay in both the strategical and tactical areas. Victory is also a lot more gratifying.If you liked XCom, you must try this.And if you like the game, there's a Community Edition available in the game's properties -> Beta. This community improved many aspects of the game, and it's even more amazing !I wrote a guide for it, take a peek if you're curious:

												Imagine this : You send a squad of eight, somewhat experienced troopers to a shot down UFO which you have never seen before nor do you know who or what's inside.It's night, pitch black to be exact.Your squad moves away from the security of the helicopter and slowly move forward, checking around every corner for any sign of aliens, their morale slightly lowering due to the darkness and the strange sounds.They reach a cornfield, the UFO probably located behind it, so ofcourse you order them to enter the field as a sudden burst of plasma nearly hits your rifleman who took point. A big reptilian alien was hiding behind some strawbales and was waiting for you to take the bait, luckily a well-placed shot in the head took care of him quickly, good thing you brought a sniper along.The troopers start throwing flares all around, watching every part of the field carefully as your pointman suddenly finds a patch of blood on the floor next to an empty shotgun, presumably of the farmer who lives here, yet no body to be seen.A silhouet suddenly passes through an opening, only visible for a brief second, but enough to notice that that thing was something new.Your heart starts to pound as you order your troops to stand ground, watching every possible entrypoint for that thing to come through.You gunner suddenly opens fire, unleashing a hellfire of bullets to the opening you first came through, the large, bug-like horror flinching as it falls to the floor before it could reach them.So now that's dealt with, it's time to breach the UFO...and that's where the true horror starts...9/10 would get scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ again			"

								While the new XCOM: ENEMY UNKNOWN is a good continuation of the XCOM franchise many of us enjoyed so much, Xenonauts stays truer to the older X-COM games. While there are a few thematic differences - the cold war era, and the names of organisations, aliens and objects being different (copyright evasion powers activate) - the game plays in an almost identical way - you can have multiple bases and troop craft, the interceptions are more interactive and still good, bases are viewed from above - and the tactical combat keeps up the level of tension fans will be wanting.I also want to praise the addition of civilian combatants. They're not amazing, but sometimes it's nice to see the rest of the world fight back.There are a couple of UI issues that need to be resolved, but nothing that makes it a chore to play, or breaks the game.

												As close to a faithful recreation of the original masterpiece ""XCOM: Ufo Defence"" or ""UFO: Enemy Unknown"" depending on where you live.It adds a few things, while removing others in order to improve gameplay. For one, it has a really solid cover system that ""just works"" and doesn't get in your way. It adds suppression to improve your tactical choices. It also gets rid of human psionics and thus removes one of the biggest cheese-tactics there was in the original. In addition, there are no such things as ""shoot around corner mini nukes"" for either side. Very welcome!In short, this game is every bit as much of a masterpiece as the original. It's graphic style is unique and gloomy and fits the setting perfectly. Expect many hours of strategic and tactical fun here.			"

												What an amazing, remastered UFO: Enemy Unknown! At least that is what I want to write as a first line, but that won't be fair for this game. This game is more than just a remastered restart - it is more like ""take the ol' game, ged rid of everything anoying & add some cool stuff"" and well, it paid of! I wasn't playing this game for a long time, I didn't even finish my first full play ('cause of Long War mod in XCOM: Enemy Within) but still, I am going to recommend this to everyone, who cares about some good ol' strategic games. This game is more like a chess - you must think twice before you make a move; if you won't, your soldiers may not see the end of the day.Also beware, that this is an indie game.

Pros; More micro management of resources, technology and building. More than one base, build as many as you want so long as you have the money. Air combat mini game against those pesky alien UFO’s. Send down bucket loads of soldiers down to fight the alien invaders (as not all of them are coming home). A longer prolonged campaign that can be drawn out.Cons; No streamlined and snazzy graphics.

												To put it simply, Xenonauts is an oldschool remake of the classic X-COM. And that means it retains the brutality of the original while still being incredibly fun to play. The graphics, while somewhat cartoony in places (notably cars) serve the art style well and convey the message of grimness throughout the game.Sound is fine, but some noises I found hurt my ears with headphones. Other than that not much of note aside from the good soundtrack.UI is somewhat complicated but easy to learn, while providing most of the vital information to keep your guys from not dying a horrible, awful, painful, and plasma-y death.Gameplay, the big G.It feels like X-COM. Not in a shoddy knock off way, but in a ""The devs knew what they were doing when they made this glorious game graced by the almighty Gaben himself"" way, complete with Time Units, Panics, and a boatload of potential ways for your poor plasma sh-err great soldiers to die. This includes fully playable air battles (which I recommend autoresolving for the most part), terror missions, abductions, and my love/hate favorite, the classic base defense.Have I mentioned how hard the game is? It is pretty difficult, but if you have played X-COM style games before, you will know what you're doing, but still get completely and utterly pimp slapped if you act like your soldiers are Rambos and Rambas.All in all, get it, or get plasma-ed.

												Rarely do I drop cash on a game when its fully priced. But with Xenonauts I broke that trend, and the defilement team deserves every penny. The game is a brilliant spiritual successor to X-Com. It has its improvements over the original games, however any seasoned veteran of the games will be able to take to this as if they were right at home.The new and improved air combat system is also a welcome addition. Though at times it can seem a bit dumb, having to micro your ships to fly directly at the enemy ships is a bit weird (when you click on them they adjust to their flight path but that's rarely what you want)I would suggest anyone who lives X-Com buy this game. If you don't like the originals however, this game is not for you. It is every bit as difficult as the originals and every bit as nail biting.			"

												I missed out on the delight of XCOM in my youth, and the modern incarnations never grabbed me, however this game has been fantastic and I have already sunk plenty of my time into the vanilla, community edition, and CE modded versions of the game. I highly recommend playing the Community Edition over standard release at this point as the community has created about the best version of the game that can be made.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original XCOM, or missed the boat and wants to see what the fuss is about. Warning: This game is pretty difficult, and so far I have yet to muddle my way through a full campaign on normal. Though I play on iron-man, so it's difficult to tell how well I'd do save-scumming. If you're unsure, check out some videos or take full advantage of the refund policy - but don't let this one pass you by if you like the idea of defending against a cold-war era alien invasion.			"

												I played the original UFO defence back in the grim and dark days of the mid and late 90's.  This, is what X-COM should be, should have been, not the flashy remake Sid Mierer's did.  For me, that one was all show and no go, even with the expacs.  This however, feels like X-COM, and I am fighitng for my life as hard in it as I was in UFO Defence.  This is what I remember, the fear, and, the fustration.			"

												I missed out on the delight of XCOM in my youth, and the modern incarnations never grabbed me, however this game has been fantastic and I have already sunk plenty of my time into the vanilla, community edition, and CE modded versions of the game. I highly recommend playing the Community Edition over standard release at this point as the community has created about the best version of the game that can be made.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original XCOM, or missed the boat and wants to see what the fuss is about. Warning: This game is pretty difficult, and so far I have yet to muddle my way through a full campaign on normal. Though I play on iron-man, so it's difficult to tell how well I'd do save-scumming. If you're unsure, check out some videos or take full advantage of the refund policy - but don't let this one pass you by if you like the idea of defending against a cold-war era alien invasion.			"

												Play balancing has a long way to go in this game before it will be worth playing. Don't buy it until they have released a few patches to fix it. Alien psychic abilities are way too powerful and you have no way to defend against them. Expert marksmen will miss more often than not, even with a high % chance to hit. And the worst (possibly a glitch, I'm not sure) is loading a saved game only to have the situation different than when you saved. The worst example, in my own experience, was when I had cleared an alien base. All except the last room. (the command room) Decided to take a break, saved my game and exited. When I came back and reloaded, suddenly my troops were surrounded by aliens that hadn't been there when I saved. I couldn't continue the fight because my soldiers were automatically killed every time I reloaded. This and a number of other balancing and glitch issues make the game no fun to play. A perfectly good playthrough can quickly and easily be ruined by bad code and balancing. Hopefully they fix these things soon because the game has promise, it's just not where it should be yet.			"

												Where XCOM: Enemy Unknown takes much of the GI Joe aesthetic of the original and amps it to extremes, Xenonauts makes you feel like you are always on the losing end of a war.  There's a few design choices I either dislike or find rather enigmatic, but it also makes substantial improvements that even Firaxis' version misses out in doing.  It is a very a worthy spiritual successor to the original X-COM. "

												============================================XENONAUGHTS============================================Overview:On the face of it Xenonaughts is a high quality 2D planetary defense game with stratergy and minigame elements with a little story telling all thrown in and mixed with a heavy influence from the Xcom Series and perhaps a bit of a steep price tag for an indie game attatched.What the store doesnt tell is that the actual gameplay is a fantastic weave of impeccible timing, forced strategic and tactical improvisation and improvement, and delightful frustation when your elite squad wipes out for no apparent reason other than ""better guns"" which will often cause you to swear vengence upon the alien scu- ""liberators"" the developers have done a fantastic job with this number which i shall go into further detail below, fair warning though.                                                               !!!!WALLS OF TEXT!!!!                                                              You have been warned============================================The Guts:Simply a fantastic game, I have been gaming for a little over 10 years now and I almost exclusively play stratergy and/or survival games, and of all the stratergy games I have played this has to be the most perfectly timed and tailored one fo them all at no point are you ever truely able to outgun the enemy your often outnumbered and if you turtle up one grenade or well placed lizard thing and your squads dead forcing you to rethink and restratergise without overwhelming you add the fact that if you dont plan and execute your stratergy and tactics right or do something stupid you cna lose your entire squad (and the alien victory conditions) adds an element of survival which automatically triggers the ""KEEP EVERYONE ALIVE!"" switch in me keeps me coming back after a rage quit form losing my entire squad (and not saving :P hey i refuse to accept a wipeout!).the Pacing is also fantastic at no point are you ever really given too much to handle if you know what your doing (excluding the terror missions I failed everyone because of those *Censored tangent* reapers, the fact that both you and the aliens can build and attack bases also just putrs the cherry on the cake for me simply amazing the thrill i get when i discover an alien base, the first time i did i literally shouted out YEA I GOT YOU NOW YOU ALIEN MOTHER *censored* ... course it was 1 am and i got told off but still xDto be fair there are a couple issues, 1 would be the graphics BUT it IS an indie game but if your into the more modern games it may not be summin you can get around, personally? i loved it, simple but detailed enough to let you know whats what and tell the differance between an alien lizard and a rock and perfectly fits the top down stratergy feel for me, the second is bugs there are a couple which are frequent such as aliens shooting through walls or the psionics unnerving your men from start to finish regardless of location and distance BUT both of those and much much more are covered in the community edition which i have started playing and that just adds that extra little something to really finish off the game.============================================The Meat of the matter:the game itself is split into 3 distinct parts, the first is the tactical display, a screen with a selection of tabs ranging from geoscape (live view of the planet) to base planning, research military assests such as squads vehicles hangers etc all the way to a alien encyclopedia (did i spell that right?) the 2nd part is minigames which in itself is a novel but entertaining little piece fo frustration that i have never been able to pull of yet (but that may have something to do with the single fighter in use at any given time) where you cna either auto resolve or play yourself, the third is the meat of the game for me, ground combat a classic top down view of the map where you can use the terrain to your advantage and i reccomend you do some fo the enemies only think 2 dimensionally which is fantastic for the sniper up on the third floor but terrible for the heavy round the corner from him about to be eaten alive============================================Conclusion:I cannot praise this game enough the developers have done a simply fantastic job that i havent seen anyone else do so far and the fact that they are putting some community mods into the next patch as official parts of the game just instills so much confidence in them i am really excited to see what they do next.my advice to anyone who loves stratergy, alien invasion, or base defense there WILL be something for you here, if your a fan of indie games or high quality design this is DEFINATELY something for you.

												This game is very much indeed a true remake of the true x-com series.It gives you everything X-com 1 have, and adds in alot of the features from the new x-com aswell.Also they have improved the story setting aswell as making the game userfriendly.Also vehicle section is more thought around, than in the original series.Graphics, ambient sounds and all, are very well done. Did I mention that the story is very well written?Only downside I could find, was that I could wish for more research and maps. But I recond that will be added later, or through mods. Could be me that is being picky, its around 40ish researchable things or more. But i want more.Highly recommend this game over the new X-Com. The scale of the game gets into its true form since its not for the x-box. "

Posted: September 15, 2013
												I am editing this review for the released verson of the game. Okay so my initial impressions of this game was that it was the first true original xcom successor, and if you felt enemy unknown released in 2011 was too simple or just not enough like the original, you'll find all of that here and more. From watching this game very early on in development to full release, I can full heartedly say that it has come a long way, and the devs have certainly done a wonderful job making the game into all it could be. Some things in the game are still a little wonky, however it all has to do with the RNG of shooting which is to be expected in any pecentage based strategy game so I can't fault it for that as the original even had it. This game has a very wide enemy variety, and a fully interactive dogfighting minigame when shooting down enemy space ships of also wide varieties. Also this game captures my personal favorite part of the original xcom, which the 2011 verson didn't even come close to, and that is the dynamics of the game. In this game everything you do effects the way the game plays, if you don't go to certain missions or let certian abductions, bombings, etc happen, the enemies will gain the upper hand. And if they gain the upper hand instead of having a linear, boring experience like the 2011 game, you will have a very replayable strategy game that will keep you coming back to see your friends and loved ones get blown to pieces by plasma blasts. All in all this game is truly an example of what an early accsess game should be like, and has lived up to all my expectations for an xcom like successor.FINAL VERDICT: If you enjoy complex strategy games, I definitely recommend this title, however if you are looking for an easier stategy game to casually play, you won't find it here as even the normal difficulies can be extremely punishing for even experienced players. I personally love this game and hope to see its added modding community only produce more content for it.			"

Yes, the graphics suck. But I've played much worse.I'd recommend this game not only to fans of the original XCOM games (that should be a given) but also to anyone who played the recent newer XCOM games and felt they were too easy, especially if they don't mind simple graphics.

												This is the X-Com reimagining we've all been waiting for.Xenonauts was clearly made with enormous respect and admiration for the original, but this affection never stopped Goldhawk from reaching deep into the game mechanics and touching up everything that needed fixing, and many things that I never thought could have been improved. The result is not a mere 1:1 copy, and much more than just X-Com with a better interface. It's a refinement of the original, keeping the brilliant and still enormously engaging core loop intact and polishing it to perfection.If you never played the original X-Com games, don't even try. They are hard to get into, and thanks to Goldhawk, there is simply no need to wrestle with them anymore. Xenonauts delivers the same experience that made the original a legend, except better in every possible way. A fantastic achievement.			"

												The best darn $25 dollars I've spent, easily. Originally, I'm sure the developers thought they were making a xcom clone, and to be fair, they've tried their damnedest to do just that. But just playing 70 hours before its release, I can say they've made a true game, worthy of its own merit, with no need for the acclaim that comes from the backs of giants. You get what I'm saying? I don't think Chryssalids anymore, I think reapers. Sebilian and Caesan role off my tongue more easily than sectoid or mutan (whatever its called). Xenonauts is a true alien invasion simulator, with all the inherent learning curves and complexity therein. You pick the placement of your first base, and go on from there, with some great tooltips for your first time round. Speaking of which, you will fail. Try as you might, there's a detail you overlooked, and you'll have a base attacked and destroyed by the aliens, or your chinook will be shot down after taking out an alien base. Something will happen. And you'll want to keep going. Not immediately, you understand, you build sentimental attachments to your crew, but after a while, you'll get than xenonauts itch.			"

												214 hours.It took me 214 in-game hours to beat this game.It was boring and tedious, it was a constant wading through a full hoard of bugs, and in the end this game became a chore.That's my experience with this game.I never want to see this game again.However, this is a good game.This game is a full-on realistic approach to an alien invasion scenario, that blows both the original X-Com and X-Com: Enemy Unknown out of the water. Once it's done, it will be awesome.I say ""once it's done"", because this game was released back when it was very much still in the beta stage. That was a year ago, and the dev team is still working diligently at fixing both bugs and crashes to this day.I got stuck having to play the ""legacy version"", with half of the sprites for the endgame missing. I cheated by increasing the game mength to a 200 hour marathon run, and I also had to restart the game 2-3 times over because I was still playing the beta....so I both love and hate this game. You will love this game.Just don't forget to save at least once before and after your every turn.			"

												As far as X-Com ""clones"" go, this one is tops.  I have played them all (UFO: After-X series, UFO: Extraterrestrials, XCOM, etc).It takes the factors from the original and makes a few modifications, giving old players of the original (and TFTD!) a new challenge as well as making the same addictive gameplay accessible to a new generation (both with graphical and UI improvements).+UFOpaedia is in-depth and has good art. Adds immersion and a bit of humour (but never feels out of place).+BASE BUILDING DONE RIGHT!  None of that watered-down XCOM stuff here!+TIME UNITS (or their rough equivalent)!  None of this move/shoot boardgame-y junk! (Though I love boardgames, it was over-simplified).+Destructable terrain and an AI that knows when to heft a grenade (evil reminiscences of TFTD here).+A sensible economy.  The player can't abuse his workshop and is forced to yield results on the tactical side (though you can carpet-bomb UFO crashes and get 1/2 the value from the scrap if you're tapped out for ambulatory soldiers!).+Improved interception mechanics, with the option for manual control of the X-Y manuevering and engagement style, or simply an estimate and quick resolve mechanic, should you so choose.+Remarkably stable!  The original crashed on me just about as much, so no complaints here.  Also, there are auto-saves should this occur.  A real sanity-saver (even for the non-save scummer!).+A good random number generator that does not feel cheap or arbitrary.  Some serious consideration was put into it, as the same shot sequence (yeah, I scummed it to test) does not yield the same result or ""seed"".  Not a knock at XCOM, as even the Holy Jagged Alliance 2 has that.  This game just generates it fresh and, resultantly, keeps things fresh!+A good tech tree that makes sense and has a good variety. Even outmoded gear still has a situational reason for retention, making you carefully consider your composition.In short, all the delicious fat and none of the calories.  The ONLY thing I would add would be Coop campaign multiplayer, but realize this to be a pipe dream.  However, examples of merging Strategic and Tactical in multi can be found in Sword of the Stars and Dominions 4...  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge?  I'll say no more.Buy it!!			"

I loved the original X-COM games. This is literally a direct copy, with updated graphics. There was almost nothing new or creative used in this game - and I mean that in a good way. The original formula worked, but it was just dated as far as the actual software. This game is awesome in keeping that formula alive.Pros:+Awesome, addicting X-COM esque gameplay+Better global management part of the game (play other than when in battle)Cons:-Price is a bit steep-While it would be a gamble, if done right it would have been nice for them to make it slightly more of their own game-Text can be thick, and while I want to read the lore and all the details, I find myself skimming. I just wish it were more conciseIf you loved the old X-COM game(s), you will not be disapointed, although I would wait for a sale since part 2 is on the horizon. "

												[20$ tier Kickstarter backer]Yet another x-com remake, this time in realistic-cartoon art-style, streamlined, simplified and with tycoon mechanics being completely cut-out.Ground combat is pretty standard and since standard is what makes this genre, that means it's good (unlike XCOM, which plays more like JSRPG than TBT). But with smaller scope of the whole game and cutting out of a lot of mechanics from x-com, ground combat is the thing which you will do a lot, so much, that you'll start to use airstrike button to skip it. Which makes lack of auto-resolve button on some other mission-types, like terror, slightly annoying. Chasing aliens on the big map with lots of civilians and slow-thinking AI starts to wear thin after 30th hour. With new balance and items, you won't be playing with squads of highly trained army-men till the endgame, but with lots of spec-ops assault doods holding riot shield and throwing grenades everywhere, since it's extremely effective.Meta-game is significantly shrank, compared to the x-com, tech tree is smaller and manufacturing is not constant concern, but used for single time upgrades. Instead of Lord of War simulator, now your whole economy is based on governmental dotations and looting crash-lands. With it all storage management is absent, everything which is not falling in line with developer's vision is automatically sold. Using alien\civillian weapons is possible only during missions and with great penalty, which kinda creates negative possibility space. Same goes for prisoners, everyone is auto-executed, all bodies are destroyed; no more supplying disneyland xenopark with new live exhibits. Even the bases do not become outdated, but automatically upgrade themselves for free. Air combat features new mini-game, which should be improvement over x-com, but it's so convoluted, cluttered with unreadable GUI and overall unnecessary, that you can just use auto-resolve all the time and fly in bigger squadrons.Art-style isn't striking or beautiful, but it's that clear, realistic cartoonish look, which is often used in 2d indie tycoon-games, so it makes it peculiar to see it in the different genre. Game works fine in UHD UWS Surround by using pillar-boxing. It's kinda pity to lose all that additional space, but as far as i can remember it works just out of the box. Though it's easier to scroll with keys than with mouse edge scroll because of that.Technically game isn't in perfect condition, some events are causing crashes, so better to save more often. But overall at least nothing is game-breaking.Overall it's very streamlined and simplified x-com with not much new mechanics, but it is serviceable and utilitarian, despite being buggy. And most important — unlike XCOM it's not a soapy console movie in the completely different genre, all-while being equally\more buggy but from rich AAA publisher churning out DLCs and not small crumbling indie development team.Will now wait for aquaxenauts bug-fix-re-skin-expand game.

												A phenominal X-Com remake that overstays its welcome.This crowd-funded game has everything I look for in an x-com remake, and if you prefer classic x-com with TU's and stun rods and destructable terrain to the newer, friendlier, class-based game, this is the remake for you. UFO interceptions become their own fun little minigame, base building (and defending) is just like X-Com original, and the turn-based tactical gameplay, while not the same, is very close to the original, with less of a budget for explosions. If you're interested in this game, you know what you want, and this game will deliver it.One thing I should mention that really hurt my enjoyment, though, was how much of an unfriendly slog this game is, due 100% to its economy. Provided you keep all your funding nations happy, you'll make enough money for base upkeep, but not really enough for expansion, research, and building new weapons to replace your old ones. You can make some money (but gain no alien resources) by destroying downed UFO's from the world map, or you can send your soldiers on ground missions to make about twice as much money. While this ensures that you'll want frequent ground missions (that is, the whole point of the game) the fact that UFO hulls are one of the few objects that aren't subject to destructable terrain means that each time, you'll have to breach and clear UFO's through their own single-path construction, which is the least fun thing, and takes the most time. Every alien bridge is accessible from only one direction, often through two doors that are placed so that anyone on the bridge can get reflex fire on any soldiers entering. Psi isn't restricted to seen targets only, like the original x-com, and alien psykers will always stay in their invulnerable UFO bridges, and there's no psi defense like the original x-com, so you basically get soldiers berzerking and falling under alien control with no defense right up until you win the mission. All in all, this game took me 77 hours. I was done with the core gameplay at maybe 45 or 50.Buy it if you like X-Com or Jagged Alliance; no other remakes have done it for me (the newer friendlier X-Com has excellent gameplay to be sure, it's just not the same kind of excellent gameplay). It may be sad that fans keep chasing the X-Com (or JA) dragon, but there's a reason for that: They're brilliant games.			"

												I do think Xenonauts is, in technical terms, a very well made game. However from a personal perspective I didn't enjoy it all that much.Xenonauts is tedious. Most battles tend to feel the same which is in part due to the minimal number of lackluster maps (mods may at least provide some more variety).Losing is extreamly punishing. When a team is wiped not only is funding lost but also any of the very expensive gear the team may have been carrying. A very motivated player could probably manage this and even find it engaging. Others will be bored by it.The game does at least provide far more depth than the modern revitalisation of XCOM.			"

												This far out performs XCOM and even the newest ones because of its depth of play and unrelenting difficulty to survive. IF you are up for a challenge than this is your game, if your up for replaying the same level 3-20 times to get it right this is your game. IF your up for replaying that same level 20 times and you still can't do it without losing 2-3 squad members thats pretty much the best your going to do. The only drawbacks, if you pick up alien weapons you can use them but with huge penalties and they dont go to your inventory which is strange. And the explosives I wish the C4 got more powerful because honestly levelling buildings is entirely too fun.			"

												This game is the remake of our beloved X-com that we've been waiting.-All the things I always felt X-com was missing this game has in spades with a nice shiny art style in beautiful 2D sprites.  -The game has sounds and a soundtrack that help build up tension while your troops on tactical missions that keep you hoping the next corner is clear as you round it with just enough movement left before that soldier is stuck.  -UFOpidia? Perfectly done and a modding comunity has crafted addons that will further expand upon what was presented in game if you desire more.-Greatly expanded air combat gameplay where it is its own mini game if you wish to skillfully down higher grade craft not to mention you can reasurch far more aircraft than any other Xcom style game that I'm aware of.  No more T1 fighter then the T2 late game and T3 is an all in one transport.. now you have many times more to choose from and they are rather role specific which keeps them fun and interesting as you realise you're not doing direct line upgrades but rather expanding your arsenel with something that tacles a new role.-Body armor?  This game decided that each new suit of armor shouldn't nessisarly replace all prior armor but again fits a nice role so you might wish a few of each suit type if you want to take full advantage of their skills.If you enjoyed any of the X-com games and even the most recent you will find this game by far the best X-com like expirence you have ever had.  With a modding comunity adding more content and regular patching still streaming in I can easy recomend this game to anyone who enjoys this style of game.			"

												In my opinion, OpenXCom is still the best planetary defense game out there, followed closely by Terror from the Deep. Now with that said, Goldhawk has done a better job of capturing the magic formula than anyone else. In fact, no other X Com clone comes as close to perfection as Xenonauts. Needless to say, I cannot recommend Xenonauts enough. Not only is it a far superior product to the newer X Com reboots, but it's the greatest planetary defense game since X Com Apocalypse.			"

												I hesitate to call Xenonauts a spiritial successor to one of the greatest games of all time - UFO: Enemy Unknown (X-COM: UFO Defense in the USA) - rather instead, it's purely a spiritual remake.The earth has come under attack from aliens, and you manage a PMC tasked with fighting them. The nations of the world fund the company, and based on how you defend each country the funding can rise or fall. This is done from a map view of the earth, showing your base, and craft as they start to appear. To begin, just a few small scout craft arrive, easily shot down. If you intercept the craft over land, sometimes it crash lands, forming a crash site you can investigate. Alternatively, the craft sometimes lands and you can send a dropship to the location. Once the dropship arrives at the site you enter an isometric view where you can move your units, and shoot at any aliens you encounter. This section is turn based, and the amount of movement you can make is determined by how many Time Units each unit has. Once you have cleared the site, you can recover alien technologies and take them back to your base to research, leading to the ability to manafacture new items. There are many other elements to both the management and tactical section of the game, which I won't spoil here.If you're looking for a modern take or an evolution on this forumla, look instead into the excellent 2012 Fixaris reboot, XCOM: Enemy Unknown. This is a very different experience however, and I'd still throughly recommend trying the original. However Xenonauts now presents an interesting new third option. I've recommended the original to people, only to see them never really get into it thanks largely to the outdated interface. Xenonauts allows you to experiece the brilliance of the original, but tuned to remove those frustrations.For example, one of the least enjoyable parts of the original was surely the inventory management. While I love the base management overall, manually replacing every last clip, medkit, rocket, grenade wore thin pretty quickly, especially when most of the items were cheap enough to never really be a concern. In Xenonauts, this is thankfully gone for most of the mundane consumables. Other areas which have been simplified include reloading, and using grenades. In X-COM, using a grenade was a series of actions, removing it from your belt, putting it in your hand, pulling the pin/setting the timer, throwing it. Each took a small amount of time units, and it was entirely possible to pull the pin, only to realise you didn't have enough time units left to throw it. While this did invoke exactly the feeling of panic it was no doubt supposed to, it was largely just frustrating. In Xenonauts all of this is just replaced with a single action with a single time unit cost. To my tastes, they developers have thankfully only simplified elements which probably needed it - it certainly doesn't feel dumbed down.It might just be me, but Xenonauts does feel a little easier than UFO was. However, this really is no bad thing - UFO was punishingly difficult, and it wasn't unusual for newcomers to be in real trouble before even their first funding review. In Xenonauts, easy mode should allow new players to get a good long feel for the game before they start ramping up the difficulty.If you loved UFO, or you enjoy classic tactical games, if you like retro graphics style, you'll most likely enjoy this greatly. It's such a closely tied remake of UFO it almost feels like I'm reviewing that, rather than Xenonauts - either way, I cannot recommend either one highly enough.			"

												I've finally hit 100+ hrs on this game, for me that is the milestone that says I should write a review.PrenoteActually had this game on the wishlist for a long time, mostly because the Store screenshots are -how to put this politely- a bit subpar. Compared to XCOM that is. Atleast, that's what I thought at the time. Including the inherited assumption that this game is -probably- just another X-COM wannabe.Boy, was I wrong. Not only do I enjoy this game madly (with Mods) - it has even made me want to dabble with mods. That is creating mods, not just using them. How come? Well, let's explain that right now.The GameThis is one of those games that you can play in sessions (casually) or play in one go (hardcore). You can save at any one time and exit. It plays during the late '70s with the Cold War raging silently over the globe. You're the commander in charge of an operation with the aim of putting a stop to the alien threat. You can think X-COM, but technically it is also Jagged Alliance 2, even though it never refers to it. Really though, JA2. You get to build bases, modify the bases as you see fit, recruit engineers/scientists and soldiers. The latter from all over the world (depending on the Mods), including stats like previous Regiments and if they've seen any conflicts. Your soldiers will rank up gradually, retain their kill counts etc, are customizable with different gears (depending on tech & Mods) and classes, and can be renamed. Your planes will need to take down the aerial forces of the aliens so your groundtroops can recover the remains (through vicious battle).TLDR+ can always Save/Exit+ '70s era+ X-COM / Jagged Alliance 2+ customizable base / soldiers+ fairly realistic technologies & tactics+ fairly intuitive base building / GUI+ rewarding/useful upgrades & options+ compelling gameplay & progressionDownsidesNo game is perfect. So, what does this game do wrong or what does it neglect?Well.. I did spot a few typo's in both the game and in the coding. You also want to Save every now and then as the game _can_ CTD (it's not much a problem if you always manually do ground battles as the game will autosave at the beginning and ending of it - but it can become unnerving if you've done an hour of customizing all your soldiers and the game CTD's). You can play without Mods, but really - you want to play with Mods. Recovery statistics are shoddy with math. Ground battles _can_ become boring (however, Mods that add groundbattle maps can relieve a bit of that boredness - although playing in sessions could work just aswell). Aliens are ruthless, just like in XCOM - if you get upset about that then this isn't the game for you.TLDR- the odd typo- can CTD, so save-a-lot- needs Mods to be fun- shoddy math on Recovery screen- groundbattles can become boring- expect ruthless alien resistanceJudgement DayIf you don't like Xeno, their invasions, their abducting of cows, their offensive smiles as they descend upon _your_ house and set the neighborhood on fire - then the time has come for you to take up arms and join Commander Cable. Cable knows what is good for you and that is dead Xeno scum. You heard him! Now march to that store and get that Rifle out of the closet so you can join his army! Dismissed, soldier!			"

												Xenonauts is a great game. I can't stop playing it! The old school XCOM buffs will love playing it for sure. Xenonauts also runs great on my Linux (Linuxmint 17.3) Windows 10 and Window 7 computers. The game play is very stable without the mods on Windows 10. And I have yet to crash it in the 75 plus hours of game play. There have been allot reviews and Youtubes on Xenonauts game play. All I can say is the game is to tough to beat on any setting! The Steam Game tips at the link below are a good read for starting points for new players. Critical -- I built three bases to begin with good coverage a cross America's, Midlde East and Soviet Union. Make sure the bases give good worldwide fighter coverage. Critical -- Get the aircraft reseach going right away. Build hanger bays and if you have to BUY more fighters do it !  (I use six bays per base.)   Critical -- Once the game starts it is a race to to research, build aircraft, build facilities, build or research weapons and armor. If you don't the enemy will over take world countries, bomb cities and then you will lose funding which will end your career as a commander. :)There are weapons which will take the enemy down in one shot! But it will take time to aquire and finish the reaseach! Once you have the right weapons both air and ground battles move right along. :)   Tips at the link.

												If you liked the original X-Com, this game is a much more faithful update than the Firaxis games which were produced about the same time Xenonauts was released.  If you miss the turn based combat and base management aspects of the game, this one is worth a try.  There are some new/improved aspects worth mentioning such as the air combat game which is slightly more involved than in the original X-Com, and some of the penny-ante management has been dispensed with, such as you are always assumed to have adequate ammunition for your basic weaponry.  If you enjoyed the original, then you'll find plenty to enjoy with this game, plus improved graphics.			"

												When I was a teen I used to play the original X-Com Series (1+2, then apocalypse  and later even the less fortunate real time based sequels) and the first 2 were my favourite games back in the 90ies. Xenonauts does a good job in all of the important game principles that made the original great, updates handling and without overloading visuals. Hands down, do you even see visual surface after having played a game 20+ hours? You just see the game mechanics. I´m not saying that the visuals are bad in Xenonauts, it´s just not that imporant for strategy gamers like me I guess.Awaiting eagerly the 1.5 Update that is to arrive in the next couple of days. It includes some of the improvements the very active modding community has come up with and 1.5 will embed them in the vanilla game. If you haven´t played, maybe wait until the update came out.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. If your into X-com you will love this game. You have a lot more freedom in  the game compared to x-com.  Most of the time when you shoot down a UFO you can wipe it out with ground forces or just bomb it and get paid for it. It's very slow paced in the way that you have to move your soilders very slowly and point them in the right direction. You can be right next to a bad guy and not even know it, which at times is annoying. It's more tatical than X-com, and I like that you can change your soilders roles at anytime. Some roles end up being pointless, but it's nice to be able to do that. I will say the game is very unforgiving the first round or two till you get some armor. Other than that, it's a different type of x-com experince. There are some differences however,  you might find youself being able to do more than just 2 attacks in xenonauts and though as I said before you can change the role of your soilders you still have to find what best suits them.

												I've played: the original three X-Com games from Microprose; the re-done X-Com: Enemy Unknown (and the DLC and expansion packs) from 2K Games; and Xenonauts.If you're looking for a true spiritual successor to the original Microprose version of X-com, look no further than this game.  If you're familiar with the game mechanics, you'll easily adapt to this, once you figure out the way the various weapons and aliens work.Make no mistake: this game is harder than Enemy Unknown.  It's also a lot less visually polished.  Still, the graphics are perfectly acceptable as 2D sprites (and also far more moddable).  Chances are, if you're considering this game, bleeding-edge graphics aren't your major concern.  You're (hopefully) in it for the gameplay.  Admittedly, I haven't played this one for a little while, but when I last played, there were only a few ""cheap"" items that appeared in the game, all of which could be modded around if you cared to.  I gather the developer has changed some of this since then, but I haven't followed up on the development in a bit.  The main cheap aspect was the mind control and other mental powers that aliens get later in the game, mostly because (A) humans didn't get psionics, and (B) they generally had little to no defense against it.  But, as I said, that's all moddable and it's up to you to decide if you want to change it (as with many other aspects).  I'd say the game is definitely worth the $25 you'll pay on Steam, but keep an eye on GOG.com and Steam both for sales.  The game does go on sale periodically, and it's even more bang for your buck if you pay under $25.  Even so, this is one of the few newer games that I'd say is appropriately priced at $25.			"

												x-com as it was originally intended, more complex with less handholding, more realistic aliens (who can and will move when you're still getting into position)... if you liked the new X-Com enemy unknown but found the game was too restricting, this game's for you. Even if you enjoyed the new one and want to see what was cut from the original games to make the new one, it's worth a look.If however you didn't like the new x-com because it was too complicated.

								Has everything that the Firaxis XCOM is missing.  It brings back the true challenge of the original while updating the graphics.  It is just enough of an upgrade to not ruin its nostalgic effect.  The random terrain and extreme difficulty are the high points for me.  Lots of nice touches that improve on the original, like armed NPC assisting you in city fights.			"

												Basically, if you liked X-COM and/or similar games, this is one that you must have. Compared to the new X-COM games, Xenonauts simply has more depth added to it and pretty much has everything you'd want for an X-COM clone. Don't let the 2D graphics fool you, this game offers everything that's lacking in the new X-COM: Vehicles, ability to customize loadouts further and mix between classes, an inventory system, and best of all, a more involving geoscape with air battles that offers you means to not only take command on the ground, but achieve air supremacy as well, if you know what you're doing, of course.Not to mention the excellent support from the devs, even for the Linux version of the game.

												This game is a lot of fun. If your into X-com you will love this game. You have a lot more freedom in  the game compared to x-com.  Most of the time when you shoot down a UFO you can wipe it out with ground forces or just bomb it and get paid for it. It's very slow paced in the way that you have to move your soilders very slowly and point them in the right direction. You can be right next to a bad guy and not even know it, which at times is annoying. It's more tatical than X-com, and I like that you can change your soilders roles at anytime. Some roles end up being pointless, but it's nice to be able to do that. I will say the game is very unforgiving the first round or two till you get some armor. Other than that, it's a different type of x-com experince. There are some differences however,  you might find youself being able to do more than just 2 attacks in xenonauts and though as I said before you can change the role of your soilders you still have to find what best suits them.

												Do you want a game more brutal than X-Com? Do you want a tactical game where you make all the choices? Do you want to have a mission, everyone dies but doesn't destroy your game?This game is for you! Xenonauts has been around for a while and it is aging well with the mods making it better.  The best example being is the improvement in lore and the extra explaining the progress in the game for both you and the aliens.This game is basically the remake of the original X-Com, you control everything in your base which you NEED to control, not to worry about petty stuff like fuel, food and who got friendzoned by the hot accountant.  Instead your job is to control the men, control where to defend, who to send, what weapons given, what research to look into, what to invest, airpower, tanks or infantry equipment and where to even locate your base, 2nd and if able your 3rd.  Aliens come in a variety of ways, while the early game is somewhat bland, you do face 2 types which require certainly different tactics. Things will pick up in the mid game and things will get much harder, crazier and you will be expected to win. When Aliens begin to have the numbers, they will strike you back and destroy your base if you are not careful, soldiers are the key. This game is hard, on any diffulty expect to lose men and women left and right, many will not survive the hordes of Aliens which will be BRUTAL AND UNFORGIVING. You will make bad decisions, you will falter, you will be blamed for things out of your control. But Xenonauts are responsible to protect the world. Also General of the Xenonauts Program. Good luck.			"

												TL DR:Want to have steamlined,fun experience,without reading manuals or spending time pondering strategy?Go get X-Com Enemy Within,it is a great game.Want a game that expects you to think,learn,plan,and struggle?I'd reccomend Xenonauts to you then.This game...(was played only on Veteran difficulty,Community Edition.Dunno how much anything described below applies to un-modded game and lower difficulties)After beating the X-Com Enemy Within on Classic(read:""hard"")difficulty with almost no effort in  the ' global strategy' part,I wanted to try something more like the original X-Com of which I heard (who didn't,really?) so much.But decided against Open X-Com and went for Xenonauts instead,as the latter reportedly was something like original XC,but with improvements in balance and UI departments....after 3 tries on hard difficulty,being absolutely trashed as late as 3rd in game month,trying several base-management strategies,around a dozen of squad setups,half as much attempts to manage my air fleet in such a way,so it won't be swarmed,outgunned,outrunned,outspaced by UFOs(unsuccesfully,so far),I dropped the game just to get a break and think of new ways to not get screwed after a few hours.Main part of the game is still a ground assaults on UFOsWhere newest X-Com had satisfiyng combat,it never once felt near so INTENSE(even on Iron Man) as it is in Xenonauts.I can't say for sure,why exactly playing Xenonauts I felt more engaged in the game.But when I had lost a squad member,or even a whole squad in X-Com Enemy Within my reaction was 'well,whatever' at most,after getting my A team slaughtered by Androns(terminator-stlye implacable SoBs) in the night ambush, I quitted Xenonauts for a freaking WEEK.Mind you,not RAGE quitted.I  just felt exhausted,because I had no idea how to win in that conditions,where I evidently screwed up somewhere strategically,so much that neither my air forces nor ground teams were up to the task.A week later,restart of the whole campaign and different approach got me through that road block,only I found a couple others...terror missions,enemy psychics,mind control...oh yeah.Yes,this game is brutal.But it is brutal in the most awesome and satisfying way possible,where you actually need to settle down and THINK about your decisions.Because if you did a wrong choice-chances are good that you won't get a disadvatage.Not being able to keep up with the enemy's 'arms race' will make it so that winning would be simply impossible.And no,it's not fake or unfair difficulty,because there's more than a few ways to do things right,as well as there is plenty ways to ♥♥♥♥ everything up.

												I just bought this game yesterday, so I don't know all the in's and out's of it, but I'm going to write my preliminary reactions.Xenonauts wins on the feeling alone.  I haven't played the X-Com games, new or old, but I have to say that something about the ""look"" of the new one turns me off, a bit.  While the AAA style of that game left a bad taste in my mouth, the old fashioned presentation of Xenonauts is quite refreshing.  The excellent paintings and graphics evoke a definite ""X-files"" atmosphere, and the soundtrack has an excellent atmospheric dread to it.  It is quite fun to send your squads through the map, clearing buildings and establishing perimiters, hunting down that lone bug-eyed freak who you just know is going to pop out and blast your guys with a burst of plasma fire.The amount of detail and depth in the simulation is quite good, especially for fans of strategy games which are more complex.  Woefully, many games these days have a ""press x to win"" mentality, but this game doesn't.  You have to carefully manage your funds and figure out your own strategies.  Should you build a second base early on, to keep the Russians convinced that your organization can do it's job?  Or do you spend your disposable income on tricking out your North American base so that you can more efficiently capture alien tech?  To sum it up, it's a little bit of SWAT 2 and a lot of X-files, all rolled up into a wonderful old-school experience.			"

												Xenonauts is a strategy game that closely follows the original X-Com:UFO Defense in which you order a team of people who should never hold a weapon to kill or capture aliens in order to turn back the alien invasion. It feels like they took xcom and refined the UI and controls to make it less tedious and 'mis-click' prone, you don't have to build alien containment chambers and there's less chance of you making your solider move unintentionally. There's also a more in-depth interception mini-game that involves manuevers but I'm terrible at it.But yeah if you like UFO Defense get it, or if you like the idea of UFO Defense but those early 90's style of gameplay don't appeal to you get it.

												As some one who has never played the original xcom: ufo defence, I can thoroughly say this game doesnt just try to capitalise on nostalgia. It is a brilliant game in its own right. I would recommend it for any hardcore strategy fan. It can be very unforgiving and will punish sloppy commanders in both the overall strategic conflict and in the combat missions themselves. You need to stay vigilant as you are truly fighting a superior enemy. The atmosphere and aesthetic is very interesting and while the graphics wont blow you away, there are some really nice renders with some lore which create a good picture in your mind of what you are facing even if the little models of the aliens and men arent very detailed in combat. The music is also nice and eerie when you have to face the enemy or soars when your interceptors thunder towards alien craft to shoot them down. The combat itself is tactically very satifying. It has lots of depth and once you take the fight to alien bases and they do the same to you things really start to get interesting. I have many memories of individual missions and the stories that unfold in them. The heroic rookie that pulls of an unbelievably feat of bravery and kills the last few aliens even as his comrades' bodies grow cold around him. The time when I dropped my rocket launcher at the other side of the map coz my man got wounded and then had to hoof it all the way back because i had cornered an alien commander and i was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and wanted to blow his♥♥♥♥♥to xeno hell. The bunch of ill prepared and under equipped soldiers who fended off an attack on my one and only base. There are plenty of moments like this. Buy it...and suffer! In a good way haha			"

												Xenonauts-------------Summary: X-Com 1.5Multiplayer: NoCompletion: 30 hrsCards: YesCloud: NoCan't get enough old-school X-Com? Xenonauts strives to be the spiritual successor of the original game. It brings a little more of everything and streamlines features that should have been in X-Com in the first place, while simultaneously removing certain elements. Thankfully the story doesn't completely retread the original game, and opts to create its own alien backstory, which is fun to experience. The story takes place in the Cold War era, where everyone stops fighting and bands together due to the alien threat. Cue in the Xenonauts, a world-funded organization to counter the exterrestrials, study their technology, and adapt it for our own use. As the months go by, the aliens grow ever bolder, sending bigger and better ships, as though they are adapting to our own environment. Their numbers seemingly countless, they must be stopped, one way or another.Since the game is basically X-Com, I'll just outline some of the changes and what i think of them. The following are changes I thought were good:-All your loadouts are saved, and you can create your own custom loadouts and quickly equip soldiers to match that loadout with the press of a button.-Shields are a great item to have, and are much appreciated. Sadly you can only use 1-handed weapons with them.-Simultaneous movement. 'Nuff said.-Able to launch ships and soldiers while injured/low on fuel.-Civilians help you out! Suddenly the world doesn't feel as lonely as before.-UFO designs are varied and interesting.-I haven't seen aliens forever camp in one spot!-Walking consumes 3TU instead of 4TU, letting you scout about 33% further.-You are given all basic weapons for free in unlimited quantities.-Good tiles, though some art is a little off, like the portraits.-Enjoyable new story.-Air combat is very involved, though I suck at it. Also, they will run from your fleets, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.-Airstriking is great. I don't want to do every UFO mission.-Showing radar coverage is great. Makes me feel not-wasteful.-Stun rockets and grenades are great, and can be obtained early.-There's much less need of live aliens.-You are automatically refilled on supplies when the mission ends, thus you can fly multiple missions in a row in a single flight.-360 vision suit is awesome.-Easy to edit the game (though poorly documented).These are the changes that I feel could use some improvements:-Holy balls there's so many aliens! They always come in waves, multiple times a week, and the likelihood of one getting away is high.-Therefore there are a bazillion ground missions you could end up doing if you don't airstrike them.-Your aircraft are limited to 2 missiles. Considering the volume of UFOs that attack the world simultaneously, this problem is magnified.-All aircraft have considerable monthly fees. You don't even get a refund for decommissioning them.-Explosives destroy equipment upon death, which strongly discourages their use. Their blast radii are also way lower, further discouraging their use.-Aliens do not suffer from morale problems. I miss the feeling of knowing the aliens are panicking.-There is no means to train against psionics short of experiencing it first hand.-Aliens do not need to spot you before they can start blowing your mind.-No mind control or blaster launchers for your troops. Those were fun!-Burst fire got removed from most weapons. Those that do have it consume too many TUs.-The maximum accuracy on any shot is 95%, even at point blank range. You can and will miss on the 95%.-Weapons consume much more TU on average compared to X-Com, so you rarely get many shots on a full TU bar (not counting machine guns).-New weapons completely replace old ones. There are no TU or accuracy differences.-Most weapons are 2-handed now, removing many potential combinations that could have been fun.-Destructible terrain plays much less of a role. Stray shots rarely destroy stuff, and high TU-shots means creating your own entrance is rarely worthwhile.-Lack of instant movement. When you start to do dozens of missions, the time spent watching things move really adds up.-Maps are not procedurally generated. I saw multiple same maps in the same game.-Overhead map is gone.-You can't earn money through item production. Thus engineers are a constant drain on your funds, and they will never turn a profit.-There's very little stuff to buy and sell. Money is very tight in this game.-You cannot use alien artifacts. I miss being able to grab a dead alien's cannon and use it against his buddies.-You cannot fire in the air in a flying suit. So much for death from above.-As odd as this sounds, Xenonauts might be too long. It's very difficult to beat in one sitting, which is discourages replaying the game a bit. The fourth tier weapons might be overkill.-Sometimes crashes on Win 10.-The sarcastic scientist isn't very funny.As far as X-Com clones go, Xenonauts is probably the closest I've played that stays close to the original formula. It's a lot closer than the official XCOM: Enemy Unknown. However some of the changes they made oddly made the game less fun, such as the lack of mind control and blaster launchers. I don't deny these made the game much easier, but darn it, I just want to obliterate the battlefield and rain death from the skies. I like it a lot better than UFO: Extraterrestrials. I'm rather curious how they would write for a sequel to this game. By the end of the game you gain access to exceedingly powerful technology (infinite power??), and I can't imagine where they'd go from there. I give Xenonauts a 8.5/10. It's not without problems but is certainly a fine game.			"

Now, before all the Firaxis fans come out of the woodwork to make angry remarks, I have nothing against XCOM - from what I've heard it's a very good game in its own right; however from what I've seen (yes, I haven't yet had a chance to play it myself - yet - although the opinions I've heard/read and videos I've watched all seem to agree on this), the Firaxis remake changed the formula that made the original great into a more streamlined experience, that had been tailored to appeal to a larger audience - thus removing some of what made X-COM so enjoyable for some of us.However, Xenonauts has very much kept the formula the same. The basic gameplay mechanics are spot-on compared to what the original X-COM was like, except with some much needed touch-ups. First and foremost is the game resolution and interface - no longer will you need to suffer with an 800x600 resolution window and a clunky UI where the buttons don't reveal much (""What does this do? Oh I just placed some primed C4 at my soldier's feet""), and the interface taking up a third of the screen! Xenonauts has really improved these aspects and honestly, I really think that this alone makes Xenonauts worth considering, due to the sheer increase in playability that has resulted by actually having a nice, clean interface that didn't come straight out of the 1990s.Secondly, there are the combat improvements. They've really changed up the air combat in this game from what was in the original, and although I acknowledge that it's not to everyone's taste, it's certainly a lot closer to it than what X-COM's air combat was like, to be quite honest! All you really need to take into account are the manoeuvres (roll left/right and afterburner, primarily) for each plane and once you've gotten the hang of timing them and avoiding enemy fire, you'll be dropping those UFOs like flies in no time! (Although, don't mistake this for a lack of difficulty - some of the UFOs that get sent down to earth can be quite punishing!)As for the ground combat, not all that much is different from the original X-COM: soldiers are nothing more than fodder (don't grow attached and restart the game if you lose some; they're all expendable and you should always have a couple of Chinooks' worth rotating in and out of active duty, so you've always got some skilled backup soldiers in case a mission goes bad) who can all be killed by a single well-placed round by an alien if they're unlucky (it's always a ""lucky shot"" if the aliens happen to get you - ALWAYS ;) ), so using cover and smoke is very important. On a similar note, one of the things that Goldhawk have added to ground combat is a suppression system, where if your rounds miss the aliens (or vice versa) but either hit their cover or whizz by near them, they will become suppressed; meaning that they will drop to a crouch, will be unable to perform reaction fire in your turn and will have reduced TUs (Time Units) in their following turn.As for cons, I must say there aren't many. I'd say the only real cons are are there's not a HUGE variety of the randomly-assigned nationalities - although there's still quite a lot - and former units that help add some background to your soldiers, as well as the variety of generated maps being rather more limited than what was in the original X-COM. Although again, this isn't a great issue unless you replay the game a lot (but then again, who wouldn't?). However, due to the fact that modding this game has been made to be quite easy, there are community-made mods out there that remedy both of these cons.In summary, quite frankly I'm no longer able to recommend the original X-COM to people, simply because THIS exists, and that it's regular X-COM, but with some really nice improvements. If you've been hanging out for X-COM but want something a touch less dated, then definitely pick this up! I'm honestly very happy I Kickstarted this game a while back and I consider the extra money I sink into the game by buying gift copies for friends to be money well spent.			"

												The game I've been searching for ages. Since 2000 there has been so few of these really. Original X-com but updated. I've forgotten how much fun it is to individually equip tens of soldiers. Ground battles are as dangerous as they should be, air battles are innovative. Reminds be a bit of star wars rebellion space battles which was an excellent concept. But it's faster and more exciting.Realism is there and it's not been sacrificed in order to maintain game balance. Your tank is cheap and overpowering. If not very accurate. I've yet to discover many aspects of the game, I'm not googling stuff to gain advantage so I don't want to share my other guesses about the tactics. I might be wrong after all.There can be many additions for the game and from the start screen I understand that it is highly moddable. Which means a high replay value. I'm sure modders will add many fascinating stuff.In short, I highly recommend if you are a turn based strategy fan. If you are new to the gendre you might find it a bit old school but trust me, you will love it after you spend 15 mins in your first pass and will want to start again the game.It's not for casual gamer obviously. Even though it's not very hardcore, you still need some time to go through all the way and you need to be a patient wolf. It's not a fast pace game.			"

												Totally Addictive!This game is in many aspects a clone of the original XCOM.Which is a good thing!Few games offer this kind of tactical gameplay: Jagged Alliance comes to mind, the rather crappy UFO Afterlight series, Silent Storm .... Of course there is the Firaxis XCOM, which is a really good game and I really liked it. But it is different from the original XCOM in many ways, and this is not.Xenonauts gives you the basic XCOM experience with a graphical update and an improved interface. The game is very playable and it does not suffer from any crashes whatsoever.There is mod support and a lot of mods are available.One word regarding the difficulty level: When playing on veteran and above you will probably get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked. Basically after the first month it becomes very hard to do missions without losing men. Unless you are really experienced with the game and you know how to raid the larger UFOs.			"

												If you liked original X-COM, you will like this; it is almost exactly the same but with a much nicer UI.The cold-war setting adds an interesting flavour, and the overall feeling while playing is very tense. There are a few minor bugs I've noticed with the UI, but nothing showstopping. The only weak points I see are that the tactical locations are all very similar - they're using prebuilt tile maps and not randomly generating locations - it breaks the immersion a little bit when you  realize you've played the same map on a previous play. The dog-fighting mini game isn't very fun and you don't seem to gain anything by not using Auto Resolve. The Civilian AI could be a better too, as they seem to just run around in random patterns without any real objective or tactics. Keeping yourself in the black seems a little bit too difficult as well - but they provide full modding ability if you want to tweak any of the games parameters to tune the difficulty.Those points aside, I really love this game. I enjoy approaching it like a roleplaying game - naming all my soldiers and coming up with Cold-War-Esque code names for my bases, dropships, and vehicles. Highly reccomended for fans of deep strategy or tactical games.			"

												I played all the original x-com series and this is pretty good. however it has some balance problems and air combat can be quite repetative and slow. I just rage quit my latest game after turning up at a terror site to find at least 8 aliens stuffed into the corner of the map with me along with a bunch of blokes who were sitting ducks for the wierd things with fangs, so that number went up every turn. and as I didnt have laser weapons yet, each one would need multiple shots to take them down. even if they hit of course. the % chance of hitting something is wildly optimistic.so 4 turns in its obvious that this mission is toast, i've no chance. i could try and grind it out but i would loose all my men, leaving me turning to random soldier generator and its list of people with huge strength and accuracy but with so little bravery they drop their weapons and run off like a big girl if an alien so much as coughs on the same map, or incredibly brave people who have so little time units they have to run along at the back of the group trying to catch up like an asthmatic fat kit or with so little health they croak when they get hit by a so much as a glancing blow off of a nerf gun.or i could pack up the soldiers i have been training from that bunch of schlubs into an elite fighting unit and surrender and run off like the french army whenever they see so much of a menacing looking bratwurst appear on the horizon. And by doing that I'll loose a whole bunch of funding and possibly the region, so ending the whole game a bit earlier.i chose ragequit.again the laser weapon thing is annoying. you can pick them up off the aliens and use them, however when you end the mission they are automatically sold. WTF? Who in their right mind would automatically sell weaponry that a) you could use and b) was better than what you currently had? You can almost imagine the Python-esque conversation that would happen back in the barracks over that one...			"

												I have never played the old 1990s X-Com this was based on, nor was I a really big supporter of the Indie game scene. My attention was directed towards Xenonauts, after a chance splurge had me acquire the new Firaxis X-Com, and while I found that game fun, I wanted something more challenging. Something mixing the depth of Jagged Alliance 2, with the concepts found in X-Com. And I found that in Xenonauts.After setting down my cash for this game after it's release, I have found myself hooked on it. The game has a great challenge to it. and I find the setting choice (Early 80s Cold War) to be very unique given most games of this type focus on the near future (201X) Earth. If X-Com: Enemy Unknown is a fun, console-ish romp, Xenonauts is the thinking man's version. You are facing a constantly mounting war against aliens, where you feel the underdog. You have to manage very limited finances, as well as maintain success in both ground and air engagements. You have to plan your base deployment, and do it very sparingly. You will quickly find yourself running out of money in this game if you aren't careful. You can also find your best men slaughtered by bad choices in ground tactics or your entire aerial squadron grounded for three days of repairs if you make a bad call while aliens ransack the world.This game is not brutal, but it doesn't pull it's punches. It reminds me of the old days of gaming, when PC graphics power had a ""ceiling"", so games had to focus on depth and gameplay. Xenonauts doesn't have the prettiest of graphics, but graphics is not it's selling point nor should the game be judged on such.My only complaint regarding the game, is that you can't use any successful profit-making skills in it, and while this has been addressed by Mods, my attitude towards Mods is skeptical, at best.I highly recommend Xenonauts, as it is a very amazing game given the limited resources the developer had. I'm now looking towards Indie Games, cause of what I saw Goldhawk Interactive do with it's Kickstarter campaign.I hope Xenonauts gets an expansion or some new additions, and that it's future is *NOT* left in the hands of User-Made Mods.

												I started off playing the revamped XCOM: Enemy Unknown on the Xbox 360 before converting to PC master race, and throughout that positive experience I would keep saying to myself ""Wow this is easy, not a realistic view of an alien invasion"" and then my mate said ""want the next level, play this game"" After several hours on my craptop (yes I have now upgraded) I spent a lot of my time completley getting my♥♥♥♥♥demolished on the Hard difficulty. If your looking for something challenging and in my opinion better than XCOM, welcome to the Xenonauts, an all round excellent Planet Defence Simulator that unfairly punishes you for the smalliest tactical errors, Enough said ;).

												TL DR:Want to have steamlined,fun experience,without reading manuals or spending time pondering strategy?Go get X-Com Enemy Within,it is a great game.Want a game that expects you to think,learn,plan,and struggle?I'd reccomend Xenonauts to you then.This game...(was played only on Veteran difficulty,Community Edition.Dunno how much anything described below applies to un-modded game and lower difficulties)After beating the X-Com Enemy Within on Classic(read:""hard"")difficulty with almost no effort in  the ' global strategy' part,I wanted to try something more like the original X-Com of which I heard (who didn't,really?) so much.But decided against Open X-Com and went for Xenonauts instead,as the latter reportedly was something like original XC,but with improvements in balance and UI departments....after 3 tries on hard difficulty,being absolutely trashed as late as 3rd in game month,trying several base-management strategies,around a dozen of squad setups,half as much attempts to manage my air fleet in such a way,so it won't be swarmed,outgunned,outrunned,outspaced by UFOs(unsuccesfully,so far),I dropped the game just to get a break and think of new ways to not get screwed after a few hours.Main part of the game is still a ground assaults on UFOsWhere newest X-Com had satisfiyng combat,it never once felt near so INTENSE(even on Iron Man) as it is in Xenonauts.I can't say for sure,why exactly playing Xenonauts I felt more engaged in the game.But when I had lost a squad member,or even a whole squad in X-Com Enemy Within my reaction was 'well,whatever' at most,after getting my A team slaughtered by Androns(terminator-stlye implacable SoBs) in the night ambush, I quitted Xenonauts for a freaking WEEK.Mind you,not RAGE quitted.I  just felt exhausted,because I had no idea how to win in that conditions,where I evidently screwed up somewhere strategically,so much that neither my air forces nor ground teams were up to the task.A week later,restart of the whole campaign and different approach got me through that road block,only I found a couple others...terror missions,enemy psychics,mind control...oh yeah.Yes,this game is brutal.But it is brutal in the most awesome and satisfying way possible,where you actually need to settle down and THINK about your decisions.Because if you did a wrong choice-chances are good that you won't get a disadvatage.Not being able to keep up with the enemy's 'arms race' will make it so that winning would be simply impossible.And no,it's not fake or unfair difficulty,because there's more than a few ways to do things right,as well as there is plenty ways to ♥♥♥♥ everything up.

I never really liked the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown and much as the original ones, since they had the feeling of freedom, that new ones lack of and had not been restricted as much with choices.			"

												For decades people have been screaming ""just remake the original XCOM with bugfixes and without the 16-bit limitations"" and Mythos/Microprose have both resoundingly ignored this advice because uhh they're British and too busy driving on the wrong side of the road to listen to reason or something I guess. Anyway there was an open-source XCOM like ten years ago but it was pretty buggy and ugly and basically an uninspiring failure like most of the open-source Free As In I Don't Give A Sh­it games of the time were. But now these other people have made Xenonauts and it's exactly like the original XCOM but with bugfixes and without the weird 16-bit limitations so lol guess the original developers missed the boat on this one.There's also, of course, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, which is sorta like the original XCOM except dumbed down and with pretty bad/non-existent map variety. It's more streamlined and more instantly-playable than Xenonauts, but it's also dumbed down and the map variety is terrible. There's a place for both games. Get XCOM if you're a noob or Indie, Casual or just wanna shoot aliens or whatever; get this if you want the original XCOM, except with bugfixes and without the weird 16-bit limitations, or you're a bushy-bearded strategy game beardo.

												My introduction to X-COM was a mass effect clone called The Bureau, a very underrated game, but that's for another review. I also played another X-COM games like UFO, but that one was unplayable with my actual PC and Enemy Unknown a few weeks ago. So I'm not going to compare this game to UFO or EU and of coruse I will focus of why this game is great even if you never played a X-COM.This game has a great lore at even at 80 pages prologue novel, but it's not focused at all in the story, the entries in the xenopedia are fun to read but that doesn't count as plot. So this game focuses on the gameplay and it really shines in that aspect, every action cost Time Units (TU) and you can make any action in any order if you have enough TU, you can't shoot and alien move  to another position and if you have enough TU shoot another alien or reserver some TU for reaction fire in the aline turn.Xenonauts is one of the most addicting, well made and challenging TBT that I played, their graphics are pleasing for today's standards beside being 2D they are hand drawn style and the particles from the explosion, and shoots and others  are pretty well done.In conclusion Xenonauts is a great game for that's who love TBT and want something refreshing but just a pure TBT.

												This is truely the pennicle of the genere in my opinion. More polished and fun than the original X-com and more detailed and challenging than the ""Enemy Unknown"" remake, this game really scratches my itch for turn based tactics and global scale strategy.  It's not as pretty as a lot of other games, but that is well balanced by the addictive ""one more turn!"" gameplay. Of course, there are a few niggling details that are bothersome. Even at lower difficulties, this game can be punnishingly, frustratinly hard. When you're first starting out, it plays more as a rougelike with frequent restarts or save loads until you can get your initial base(s) established and have figured out a good order to unlock the tech tree. Additionally, the maps get reused more often than I would like, though there are workshop projects that remedy that complaint. Hell, even the difficulty ends up adding to the charm (and nostalgia) of this game. Seriously, though, if you're even remotely interested in this kind of game, you're doing yourself a diservice if you've not already aded Xenonauts to your cart.			"

The graphics, gameplay, and UI stay true where they were successful while parts that were lacking have been improved or redesigned.

												Xenonauts is what Xcom should have been. The most important feature in the game I can see is the Action system instead of 2 action move or shot. You can move or shoot as long you have enough action point for that action. Want to do a reaction shot save up enough for that shot. I like how this game force you to look in every direction unlike XCom your soldiers are nearly deaf. You can only hear the sounds of doors and no the game won’t deal you which direction did that sound came from. From what I read about this game lots of people said it has lots of micro management I disagree the game is simple enough for every and the UI is well designed. Having the ablity to ship items or rearranging my strike force is a plus for me. It is good to mention that this game has big modding teams doing and add lots of great maps and weapons as well as unities and UI fixes in this game I recommend checking them out.If you like Xcom get this game It will suck you in very fast and you will have a love/hate relationship with it  "

												First I have to say that I did not like the artistic direction or the setting of the game (cold war era). What is wrong with the ""sometime in the near future""? And why such a cartoony artwork?However this IS the ufo enemy unknown remake that everybody was waiting for. It is faithful to the original to a fault. Whatever is not like the original xcom is a well thought improvement that we all wished the original had to begin with.In short this game is a must for old timers like myself and a must for newcomers that have not experienced the awesomeness that was xcom in the 90s.Now if only the devs would make  something terror from the deep like for the first expansion.

												If you ever played and enjoyed the original XCOM then Xenonauts is pretty essential while if you played and enjoyed the XCOM reboot 'Enemy Unknown' then Xenonauts is still worth looking into. In many ways this is the spiritual sequel to the original XCOM and while I can understand that it may be too 'hardcore' and intimidating for alot of people I still believe that anyone who enjoyed the XCOM reboot should still give it a shot. It might end up being too much for you to take in, or it might prove to be too difficult  but I'm pretty sure that you'll enjoy the process of discovering that because it scratches the same itch in so many ways. The base grounding of knowledge that you'll have from Enemy Unknown will also help you bed in gently as alot of the systems are very similar, it's just that in Xenonauts they're also that little bit more indepth. Steam Workshop support was recently added and already there have been mods uploaded which add even more variety and quality content to the game and I'm sure that in time that content can only grow. In short. Xenonauts is smashing. Give it a shot if you like this sort of thing. It was without doubt one of my games of the year 2014			"

												As a huge fan of X-Com/UFO: Enemy Unknown (and Terror From the Deep) I felt let down by the path of  the modern remake of ""XCOM"" with its smaller squad sizes, missions that took a fraction of the time, and the overall feel of its base management system.Well what have we here? ""Xenonauts""? I have NOT been disappointed. Touted as the spiritual successor to the original X-Com games and it really does live up to the hype.PROs:- Base management: Way more in tune with the original, building hangars, labs, living quarters, workshops.- Research: Still figuring out the order in which I should be researching but loving it so far, trying to improve the classic stuff (weapons, armor, aircraft, etc).- That classic feel! Guess what? Your prize Lieutenant is going to get shot by an alien in the dark, your recruits (Privates) are going to panic, and that frustration of combat missions is really recaptured. You hate it, but you LOVE it!- Computer AI: Very very good. The aliens don't just walk around shooting you as they see you. They can be quite content to know you're outside their craft from having had their pal shot to bits, and hole up in there behind some cover... waiting for your Lieutenant to say... ""open the door, Private!""- Mod community: Not looked into it, but like a lot of titles on Steam it seems to have a community for mods, and that can only be a good thing!- Music/Atmosphere: That sometimes menacing, sometimes spooky music from the old X-Com? It's not the same, but it has that same feeling.CONs:- They could do more to lessen the learning curve for new players. Things like outfitting your soldiers with grenades should be done as standard. I think I did my first 4-5 missions wondering why grenades weren't on Xenonauts because they'd be damn handy! Turns out they are, you just need to outfit your soldiers before the craft leaves the base.- Targeting. I know this will come across as a gripe, but when you run up behind an alien within touching distance, with a shotgun, get a 95% chance to hit and MISS... well, part of the charm? Or outright unrealistic? ;)OTHER THINGS:- Civilians are present on some of these missions, some of them are armed (most of them panic and crouch with their hands over their heads), but the armed ones  WILL fire at the aliens!- ""Normal"" difficulty. Damn hard! As it was in the original, and I'd recommend jumping in at this level for nostalgia's sake ;)Overall then... if you're looking to play an updated version of the old 90s X-Coms then I would HIGHLY recommend this. As always, check out some YouTube footage before purchasing, but I'm having a blast! Sadly, so are the aliens!			"

												Want a more upgraded XCOM? Here it is. It's literaly based off the XCOM series with the origenal in mind. I like it much better then the current XCOM, XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within. Xenonaughts incorperates indepth stratagy of bases, much more economics, and my favorite feature...fighter combat. Although it's not very complex, it's amazingly fun. I'd buy just the fighter combat as it's own game. Definatly worth the money, as it is half the price of Enemy Unknown and just as good.On a side note there have been some glitches, but that mostly involves my soldiers being able to see inside alien ships without suposedly being able to, and the occational sprite glitch. Nothing that breaks the game however.			"

												This is truely the pennicle of the genere in my opinion. More polished and fun than the original X-com and more detailed and challenging than the ""Enemy Unknown"" remake, this game really scratches my itch for turn based tactics and global scale strategy.  It's not as pretty as a lot of other games, but that is well balanced by the addictive ""one more turn!"" gameplay. Of course, there are a few niggling details that are bothersome. Even at lower difficulties, this game can be punnishingly, frustratinly hard. When you're first starting out, it plays more as a rougelike with frequent restarts or save loads until you can get your initial base(s) established and have figured out a good order to unlock the tech tree. Additionally, the maps get reused more often than I would like, though there are workshop projects that remedy that complaint. Hell, even the difficulty ends up adding to the charm (and nostalgia) of this game. Seriously, though, if you're even remotely interested in this kind of game, you're doing yourself a diservice if you've not already aded Xenonauts to your cart.			"

												A good remake of the classic UFO: Enemy Unknown (or X-COM: UFO Defense for the 'muricans). Better than Firaxis' 2012 X-COM, though that game is good too. It's set in the cold war era, which is great, but not much is done with the setting. It's mainly in the art.Gameplay is pretty much the original UFO with some improvements, like bit more elaborate air combat and cover system. There is a lot of little things that bother me, but mods could fix the most of them, and there seems to be a healthy modding community. For example, the maps are generated semi-randomly like in UFO, but the maps generated are often boring, but there is mods that adds a lot of new submaps for the game to build it's maps from. The weapon tiers are a bit too obvious and gamey, this bothered me on the Firaxis' game too, but I can see how mods could fix that.Something not as fixable by mods is that the engine doesn't seem to handle z-axis so well. The sightlines are sometimes illogical when looking above and below. That's probably why the UFOs have teleporters instead of those lift tube things of the original game. The enviroment destruction seems to be on par with the original game, not as great as in X-COM: Apocalypse, but OK.It has some of the addicting quality of the original UFO. Endgame drags a bit, though. Overall very good and I got to try some of those mods.			"

												Storytime - very mild game mechanics spoilers;It was my first base assault. It got called in the middle east, and I'd been putting the raid on hold for a geoscape week. The team was led by Lieutenant Jennifer Miller, a strong shieldwoman previously of the American Navy Seals. She was the one who I could count on to open doors and have the Reflexes to not take reaction fire, and ""shock-jock"" with a stun baton to take alien scum in alive.The firefights were long and daunting, fending off aliens in their own sprawl, and constantly keeping an eye on my rear-guard. Reapers and assault sebilians made me pay for every corridor in blood, to the point when it came to the alien base's command center being the last room, Lieutenant Miller was the only one remaining. A sebilian officer geared for war charged my team of three, killing the sniper who failed to hold down the kill zone corridor before the command room, and mauling a rifleman on its way.Lieutenant Miller retreated and bunkered down with just a laser pistol and a broken riot shield, ready for a last stand, but the sebilian officer withdrew back to the command room to hold the fort confidently. Lieutenant Miller fell back herself desperately, over the gore of firefights that happened a half hour ago. But among her dead allies, one had a RPG launcher still loaded, and some rockets on their belt. It was enough munitions to seek out the base's power core and destroy the base, but Lieutenant Miller wanted blood. Personally. She gathered up all the grenades she could find, and went back to the corridor, knocking on the command room's blast door with an RPG.They flooded through the smoke and fire of the blast, three sebilians, and opened fire as Miller was hunkering down and putting in another rocket. She took a graze, but responded with a stun grenade that culled the weaker ones unconscious, then filling the command room with two more rockets. To much relief, the mission became a success. The base was captured.On the lonely carrier back to home, it was shot down by a very, very angry squadron of alien fighters over the Atlantic. Yet fortune would have it that the local navy would find Lieutenant Miller barely alive out at sea, and ushered back to HQ to receive decoration and promotion to Captain for her legendary service.

												Xenonauts is basically a faithful remake of the original classic Xcom (not the recent new Xcom remake by Firaxis). Now if you played and loved the classic Xcom, you will definitely love Xenonauts as it plays almost identically like the classic (with some improvements). If you've only played (and loved) the Xcom remake, then be warned, Xenonauts plays very differently. I personally found the Xcom:EU remake annoying but loved Xenonauts, so i imagine those that loved Xcom:EU might find Xenonauts frustrating.If you've never played any Xcom before, then the game is probably only recommended for those who love a 'hardcore' turn-based squad-level strategy game. The game has a base-building resource management strategic layer, but the real meat of the game is in the tactical combat. You will be spending hours fighting battle after battle, poring over each squaddie's movement and facing, trying to flank enemies, agonizing over decisions to rush troops in the line of enemy fire, or taking risky shots with allies in the field of fire etc. If you don't enjoy tactical squad combat, then you won't enjoy this game. Take note, you WILL lose soldiers, don't get too frustrated over that.I completed the game on normal mode. Had to reload the game a few times due to some stupid tactical errors, but i didn't find anything to be too unfair/punishing. I don't play ironman on the first run-through cause i want to make sure i can reach the ending and i don't want to waste time constantly restarting. The game can get a bit repetitive  and 'grindy' in the later stages but taking my high leveled elite squad to the final battle and practically breezing through with almost my entire squad surviving and escaping was pretty satisfying.The only cons i have (other than slightly grindy later stages) would be the boring air combat system. After a few rounds of air combat, i resorted to just using auto resolve as i didn't find the air combat particularly engaging.Overall i enjoyed the game. I especially loved some of the improvements over the classic Xcom:- More organized squad equip/management with ability to customize your own soldier roles/class- A handy line of fire indicator so i know what objects are in the way- A nice suppression fire system (suppressed units cannot take reaction shots and start with only half TU's on their turn)- No more hunting the last alien hiding in some basement somewhere. Mission ends if you clear the UFO of all enemies for 5 turns.- if you are bored of sending your troops on ground missions, just airstrike UFO's from the air for some cash.			"

												Something about the screenshots of Xenonauts always put me off playing the game in the past, I couldn't put my finger on it; although I think the game itself looks great, the screenshots didn't do it justice. But as a big fan of the early X-com games as well as the 2012 reboot I was lured towards Xenonauts, it was one of those games that got under my skin, I kept looking at it on steam, on the fence as to whether it was worth the full asking price; I'd have to say after completing the campaign that it most definately is.Where as the 2012 Firaxis X-com reboot was more of a reimaging, Xenonauts is an up tp date version of the older X-com games, bringing back time units and a whole list of other unit statistics giving the game a certain retro charm.The main story arc of Xenonauts was brilliant, although it's another version of what has gone before, in my opinion it's a story which is more believable than those that have gone before it. The pseudoscience that backs it up is second to none and the tech tree that backs the game up brings some fantastic ideas with it, bulking up what we're used to in this type of game, again all of the research topics are given great entries, made to sound believable, as if all of the technology could potentially exist.The new additions over the original 90's X-com are great: - Realtime air to air combat between your fleets of interceptors and UFO's- A variety of weapons for ground combat, shotguns, assault rifles, LMG's etc- Suppression effects for human and alien units- The ablilty to see a soldiers stats before you hire them- Flashbang grenades for assaulting enemy units- Cover that offers units protection and can be effectively flankedIn addidtion to the above the alien units are all unique and all have unique combat tactics/ablilites which maintains a real ""alien"" feel to the first encounters you have with them, more than once I struggled to comprehend what I was faced with on the battlefield resulting in a last minuite change of my tried and tested tactics.All in all, a must for fans of the 90's X-com games; as well as those who enjoyed the Firaxis reboot and don't mind learning the new interface.

												I played this in the past and whilst i liked the concept i had a lot of issues with the ground combat. Particularly regarding line of sight/cover. Those issues seem to be fixed now with version 1.5/1.51 and since getting the game i've really been enjoying it. It is addictive, engrossing and fun. Theres a lot of UFO type games out there. I was a big fan of X-Com 2012 and of the original that came out back in 1997 but i think this is possibly the best of the genre.			"

												For quite some time I've been looking for a tactical game which brings both (kind of) grand strategy- and MAINLY tactical-squad-driven-gameplay and also works on my old macbook, which unfortunately the newer x-coms don't. I've played through excellent games of this genre like door kickers and breach & clear, but needed something more. Finally, I believe I have found that game. If you like tactical, turn based combat where you have to put thought behind your movement; then you are going to LOVE this game. I have only played it for about two hours now, but I believe it will be plenty more hours of enjoyment to come! So to sum up: I strongly recommend this game. Strongly enough that I felt I had to pop my cherry of reviewing games on steam.			"

												If you liked the original X-Com (UFO Defence), then play this game. Xenonauts is the spiritual successor to the original DOS classic; with an original storyline set in the Cold War era, you are responsible for the defence of Earth against an escalating alien invasion. Cover the entire Earth's airspace with your interceptor aircraft, take out alien craft and send in your strike team to finish them off in turn based combat. Research alien technology and interrogate captured aliens to discover more about the invasion and ultimately turn the tables.			"

												As a fan of the original X-Com series, and someone who spent many nights shivering with tension on those critical night missions a long time ago, Xenonauts recaptures all of that - and more. It had a bumpy ride through development but honestly it has turned out a solid game, and I'm very happy to have supported it early on.One of the strengths of Xenonauts is the tactics that you can pour into playing the game, on the base management level, or the battle maps themselves. This is what people were crying out for and didn't really get in the otherwise decent XCOM game: the ability to fine-tune your planning and tactics, and go different routes. Tank and heavy weapons? Rapid response scout team? Traditional army style? Beserkers filled with explosives? Patient sniper team? You can make all of these work. Plotting your route through the maps and vying with the alotted time just feels right. And on the globe view - base placement, setup, research order, and all that. This all matters way more than XCOM. I'd say the AI - though not mindblowing - is just as good as the XCOM game if not better simply due to the more complex map design.Just play out your first night mission and listen to those noises. It's very dark out there and you're all alone and it's all going to go horribly wrong - maybe.One of the great strengths of this title over the originals, all the unofficial remakes, and the recent XCOM game, is that the maps needn't be repetitious. The system in place for juggling map assets does the hard work, and the editor is extremely powerful and will no doubt fill your hard drive with hundreds of variants (all of which, really, produce their own limitless variants). So if you take the time to download them, or map packs, or produce your own (it's fun!) you can cure one of the biggest nagging problems with the series' formula.Can't really recommend this strongly enough to strategy fans.

												This game is probably my favorite game in the last few years. Honestly, I almost like it better than XCOM: UFO Unknown. I've played through it once now. I DID play on Normal and without Ironman Mode and saved, like, every three seconds, but I still played it.But anyways, what's so good about it?-Feels similar to the old XCOM, which is good-Pretty deep base management-TONS of technology. More than either of the XCOMs. -An EXTREMELY awesome air combat system. Much better than either of the XCOMs. Instead of fighting one-on-one, you can go up to 3v3, and the way it works is almost perfect. Once you get the hang of it. Spend the time getting really good at it.-A pretty decent economy, you do well, you get more money. I do wish you could sell your advanced weaponry for more than what it is now. You'd think countries would want to get their hands on some shiny new guns.-Really good tactical combat. Lots of fun. Pretty darn hard if you aren't careful though. -Mods. You can mod the game. I haven't, but it's there.-Tons of overall content. There's not much I didn't like. Mostly just stuff with the difficulty. On normal. So, IT'S HARD. Get it if you want a challenge. IF you just want to blow stuff up like in XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, this game might not be for you.As of the creation of this review, I have played one game through, which took me 40 hours to complete.

												Frustrating at times. It improves on elements of the original XCOM series, though the AI is extremely predictable and sees everyone and everything. Easy to counter after a few games, but that can be worse.Overall, it is good. The AI issue isn't so bad that it's a dealbreaker (for me) but if you're not sure maybe wait for Xenonauts 2.			"

												Tried of games where you have to min/max to win?  Well search no further!  Even your best stats won't help you for♥♥♥♥♥♥in this turn-based strategy game!  Sick of aliens that you can kill in one shot?  Don't you worry, these aliens will regen more hp per turn than you can dish out in damage.  Do you hate spending action points reloading your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun?  Just pick up an aliens weapon!  They don't have to ever reload... unless you use them, then yes, yes it does.  Hate it when you get to cover and don't quite have enough action points to take a shot?  I wouldn't worry, the cover won't help you anyway! Do you have your flank covered by a belt fed, fully automatic machine capable of cutting even the toughest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in half?  That's great!  Because even with his finger on the trigger he still won't get to shoot first.  Do you have an arch of fire totally free of objects and friendlies?  That's good work soldier, cause you still somehow shot and killed your best equipped guy.Xenonauts - the aliens can shoot through walls, you can't, so play safe.10/10 - would save, re-load, re-load, re-load, re-load, save, re-load and re-load again.

I can barely beat the others and now THIS THING?""Some tips:Don't be fooled taking a scout tank and thinking that thing is decent.It's papermash against anything but the first 2 alien classes, and even they can destroy it sometimes.Don't build to manny bases at once or you'll run out of funds pretty fast.Advance slowly, nothing is gained by moving too fast/finishing quick.

												Awesome Turn Based Strategy(TBS) game.I have only clocked a few hours into this game, but what I have done has been very enjoyable.Not being big on games with a lot of text etc I have oddly found myself quite interested in the new entries that popup as you progress through the game, these detail new technologies you find, autopsy reports and other general info.The game puts you in charge of administering and controlling a organisation designed to intercept and stop and alien threat via advancing human technologies to and expanding your organisation deployment globally to defend against said alien threat.You do this by initially building a base, which gives you two interceptor jets, a helicopter transport and a crack team of individuals to neutralize any alien threats.Your base is equipped with a radar that covers a set range and when UFO contacts are detected you can launch your interceptors to shoot the target down.This is done in Real-Time and basically has you controlling the weapons and direction your plane(s) fly.Once you down the UFO you can deploy your transport of troops and land at the crash site to secure it in TBS combat FOR SCIENCE!I will not get too deep into it,The game is straight forward, easy to understand and follow the dev has done some great work in the lore and story and  it is simply enjoyable to play.Well worth the price if you are into TBS games and or the XCOM series.

												Sooo, I am currently limited to a weak tablet as only means of computing power and decided to give this game a try, seeing it's requirements were rather humane and the screenshots looked neat. Handdrawn graphics, classic turnbased action. Seemed nice enough.What I got from that was absolutely amazing. This game managed to pull me in entirely and made me go through hours, making progress and playing to see what it might pull out next. The handdrawn nature made the absolute best out of this. Detailed depictions of the autopsies, backgrounds for the sections of your base that look like a masterpiece each and change over the time as you develop new technology. It really proves that great graphical experience has nothing to do with a powerful GPU.The narrative style of the game and lots of lore that come with it only increase the experience and keeps you going on, wanting to see the next artwork and the self loving speech of your chief scientist as he tells in his eccentric way of mixing imperial and metric systems what he developed this time.Gameplay wise there is nothing too revolutionary, the game relying on what had been proven good on the early XCOM games and making you wonder why so much was lost in Enemy Unknown. It's a good strategic experience that challenges your mind at times but doesnt frustrate you or make you desperate to a point that you toss away the game. I definitely recommend this to fans of Xcom and the genre in general, a good experience for casual players and more experienced alike and a pleasure to look at.			"

												I'll get the obvious out of the way; if you liked XCom Enemy Unknown, you will probably like this. If you liked XCom Enemy Unknown, but at times wondered: - Why can I only send one strike team at a time? Why only one base of operations? Why only one interceptor at a time?- Why do my troops seem to have seemingly unlimited sources of conventional ammunition? - Why are the aliens so reactive to my scouting that I'm rewarded for crawling forward at a snails pace to 'discover' groups one at a time, rather than actively scouting things out? - Why don't the aliens ever try a direct attack against XCom (if you have enemy within, why didn't they try for a conventional attack a second time?)then get Xenonauts; which does an amazing job of both bringing up the level of depth and realism that I've come to love from XCom (don't get me wrong, I think XCom is one of the best games out there and I love its character and offerings), and delivering something thats still unique and distinctive. If you're looking for a game that does an excellent job tracking what a campaign against a hostile alien invasion might be like; Xenonauts is amazing. Buy it; buy it now!			"

												Xenonauts is what every X-COM fan from the 90s wanted. An update/remake that stayed true to the core game mechanics. The Firaxis titles Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within were both well done, very good games in my opinion, but they were ""streamlined"" or ""dumbed down"" so they would appeal to a wider market on the 360.Xenonauts, however, brings back everything people loved about the original series.If you played Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within, but the base and troop management seemed lacking or the ""dogfighting"" mechanic seemed just a little too dumbed down, then you need to try Xenonauts.You will not be disappointed.If they ever make another game like this and give it the 3D graphics that EW/EU had... I just might cry.			"

												Xenonauts has captured all the fun, excitement, and intrigue of the original X-COM games, and only intensified them in this amazing revival. With over 100 hours of play time logged on this gem, I can safely say that it is one of the most immersive and fun games I have played in a long time.      I have played Firaxis' X-COM and while I loved it, it still failed to quite capture the true spirit of the the original series. Not a problem with Xenonauts. Playing it feels like it was made by the exact same developers that made the original x-com, but with the approach and complexity that decades of gaming refinement have brought to the table.     I've heard some friends express a disenterest based on the graphics, but I can assure you that the elements of the game itself more then make up for this, and seeing how some 3D modeling can end up looking rather...cartoony or kind of silly (Planetary Annhiliation, Showrun Returns), I find it pretty refreshing.     I can't say enough about the content of this game. From the well written and detailed UFOpedia, that keeps a detailed description of every relevent item/creature you will come across and/or research, the rich histories of your team members; their prior combat experience, assignments, countries of origin, etc; to the HUGE tech tree to be plotted and explored.     The game takes place in 3 seperate environments...the ""Geoscape"", where you lay out your bases, set up manufacturing and research, hire and equip your soldiers/engineers/scientists, and watch for alien activity. Once an alien ship is spotted, you must dispatch interceptors to shoot down the enemy. Once your interceptor has engaged the ship, the second environment is entered     In the second phase, the ""Tactical Air Battle"" phase, you control up to several interceptors in a top down arial battle against the enemy ships. I have seen this tactical phase balance and transform as it was developed, and can say they have done a fantastic job with this and the balance as you research and develope more powerful crafts.      The 3rd and final phase is the ""Tactical Ground Combat"" phase, in which you control your customized team of soldiers (and various Heavy Weapon Platforms) in turn based combat against the alien invades after you have shot them down. You may also enter this phase without shooting down an alien ship if you get your lander to an already grounded UFO, a terrorist site in which the aliens are already grounded and engaged in terrorizing a major city you must defend, or an alien base they have established on Earth's surface.      There is a fantastic variety of terrain, maps, aliens, weapons, armor, etc throught the game, so it always seems fresh, even 40 to 50 hours in. even after my 120+ hours of gameplay (have played offline at times, who knows how many hours there) I still see new maps and have to come up with new strategies/approaches depending on situations.     All in all I would recommend Xenonauts to any gamer that won't be caught up on a lack of graphical complexity, and especially for anyone who likes management, strategy, simulation, or turn based games. At $25, this game is a great buy. I think the only thing keeping them from charging more is the lack of advanced graphics. The content is certainly up there with any Blockbuster game, in my opinion. Thank you to the fine developers at Goldhawk Ineractive for a wonderful product.			"

												Did you used to play XCOM back in the day, and now crave a (slightly) more modern experience? Or maybe you played the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and found it a little too... gamey. Well, send in the Xenonauts!COMPARED TO XCOM:Xenonauts is a more user-friendly, streamlined version that replaces clunky UI for more strategic depth. And this game is DEEP. Spend you hard-earned cash on buffing up your wimpy troopers and giving them sweet, sweet gear or spend it like any rational government agency would and buy more bases and jets. Lots of jets. Upgrade those babies. Yeaaaaahhh... that's it. Jets are the future. I know those lasers look pretty, but jets make those governments happy... yeaaaahhhh...Also you'll be happy to find that, although challenging, you won't have your entire team mind-controlled on the third mission.COMPARED TO XCOM:EU or EW:So you have your flashy graphics and simplified UI. But do you have air combat? Do you have the possibility of managing multiple bases around the world? Maybe you just want one base to have xenonauts in it and the rest filled with jets. Maybe you can't aford anything because you are bad at finances. This game has all the strategic depth that XCOM: EU lacks. Pinch those pennies, ladies and gents.In Closing...For those looking for a more management-oriented, strategic experience, Xenonauts will be more satisfying than its flashier cousins. It has its problems, but the free Community Edition fixes the majority of them. I really hope XCOM:EU and its sequels consider adopting the strategic management elements from this game; it makes it a vastly satisfying experience.			"

								Hey kids, have you played x-com. The original one? [jontronmoment]wwwhuszat? yusaidno? Wellthat'sunbeliavable, i don't even see how you came to that conclusion[/jointronmoment]If you played xenonauts - you practically did. Basically it is a very faitful remake of x-com made by a huge fans, which resembles original almost on 80%. Everything is there - ability to damage terrain, free fire, science and assembly division, neat ambient music, etc.And it improves on so many levels which were under-taken in original x-com - like to example - aerial fighting manual mode is best one yet i've seen in fan-made x-com(1-2)'esque games. I mean - best one in series were in x-com 3, but i feel that lots of a-holes which did not actually played 3rd part gonna downvote me for that, but whatever. That's my review, i do whatever I want, god damn it.Anyway - the game is neat and polished -it crashed only 2 times in 13 hours, and i were able to quickly recover from autosaves, authors just need a little more kicking to make finishing touches and find all the bugs. But even at this point - this is very stable release candidate rather than beta.Almost everything is there, i believe teleporter and psionic sounds are the same, which they shouldn't be, also some plasma rifles have same sound. But besides that - core is there, feeling of progress is there too, game just as addicting to mea s the original, and i just spent 14 hours playing it non-stop, for the note - in recent xcom reboot i got bored after 3 (6 in ufo afterlight) and barely finished it. Something to cosider. I think main thing about this game is that it keeps throwing new stuff at you even after you think everything is done and beaten - on normal difficulty progression is rather slow, but rewarding at that - it doesn't feel rushed, nor does it feel too slow. Just hits the spot. In the conclusion - buy this game guys - it worth every penny and delivers+it has crazy potential for modding since EVERYTHING is in xml+it has map editor. And even if you played only reboot of xcom - but original x-com and this one and compare them back to back - they are pretty damn close and xenonauts most certainly can be called X-COM: UFO Defense 2.0.

								This is a great game. I was unsure if I wanted to buy it because it didn't look all that exciting and fun in the state it was in when I bought it. Wow, was I wrong. If you are coming here from the new X-Com (like me), there is one major thing you should know. This game's missions is A LOT slower than X-Com's. This is not a bad thing, for me at least, but missions can become sort of repetative, but you don't have to fight the battles if you do not want to, you can choose to just bonb the crash site for some money.The begining will be one the most difficult parts because you are very ill equiped and the mission variation is limited. But the missions begin to vary the further you get in the game (bigger crash sites, alien bases, and terror missions).This game is AMAZING, and some of that is due to the fact that it is in Alpha/Beta (I'm not sure which one). So I can't even imagine what the completed game will have.			"

It taps directly into the same vein as the first X-Com, in terms of what you do and what you see. The enemy will kill you, there will be death and destruction, and you'll watch the world fall apart.			"

								A worthy clone (or ""re-imagining"", as the devs like to call it) of the classic game UFO: Enemy Unknown.Don't let the early access thing fool you, the game's just about ready for release save for a few missing art assets, bugs, and balance issues.			"

								Do you love XCOM? Do you wish Enemy Unknown was more like the original? Well, this is the game for you! This game takes the original concept of the first games and adds better designed UIs and gameplay mechanics, not to mention some very nice new graphics (I love them 2D sprites). This game is tons of fun and I look forward to it's continuing development.			"

												Sooo, I am currently limited to a weak tablet as only means of computing power and decided to give this game a try, seeing it's requirements were rather humane and the screenshots looked neat. Handdrawn graphics, classic turnbased action. Seemed nice enough.What I got from that was absolutely amazing. This game managed to pull me in entirely and made me go through hours, making progress and playing to see what it might pull out next. The handdrawn nature made the absolute best out of this. Detailed depictions of the autopsies, backgrounds for the sections of your base that look like a masterpiece each and change over the time as you develop new technology. It really proves that great graphical experience has nothing to do with a powerful GPU.The narrative style of the game and lots of lore that come with it only increase the experience and keeps you going on, wanting to see the next artwork and the self loving speech of your chief scientist as he tells in his eccentric way of mixing imperial and metric systems what he developed this time.Gameplay wise there is nothing too revolutionary, the game relying on what had been proven good on the early XCOM games and making you wonder why so much was lost in Enemy Unknown. It's a good strategic experience that challenges your mind at times but doesnt frustrate you or make you desperate to a point that you toss away the game. I definitely recommend this to fans of Xcom and the genre in general, a good experience for casual players and more experienced alike and a pleasure to look at.			"

												To compare Xenonauts to XCom series would be the easiest, but also unfair way to deal with this enormous strategy. Quite certainly and without any shame, Xenonauts developers Goldhawk Interactive are speaking out the truth about their inspiration - Xenonauts is spiritual successor of acclaimed strategic game XCom: UFO Defense. Gameplay resolves in circles which comprises of three main elements: management of your bases and strategic command centers via Geoscape, your game screen; real-time air combat and final stage - turn based ground combat. Although we live in cruel time when hand drawn graphics are unfairly judged as unworthy by most of the (childish) players, get over retro, but charming hand-drawn sprites and you'll enter the world of comprehensive, multilayered strategy where you can manipulate every single aspect of your gaming experience. Numerous classes, weapons, tactics, strategies, upgrades and ideas have been brought upon the table and shrouded in mystery and atmosphere which perfectly collides panic of alien invasion and Cold war isolation.There are numerous selling points to Xenonauts, but one of the most important IS and SHOULD BE that it's an honorable, greatly improved over original and richer hommage to XCom which delivers in every single aspect. It's unbeliveable that an indie team can deliver a game that even surpasses the original on so many fields.If you're into aliens and hungry for some long-lasting strategic battles that will test your nerves, luck and decisions, go for it.

												FML This game is hard and unforgiving even on normal.Don't buy/play this thinking ""Oh it's like X-Com but with old graphics!"".X-Com is casual stuff compared to this.Your footsoldiers WILL die.Every new enemy makes you think ""WTF! I can barely beat the others and now THIS THING?""Some tips:Don't be fooled taking a scout tank and thinking that thing is decent.It's papermash against anything but the first 2 alien classes, and even they can destroy it sometimes.Don't build to manny bases at once or you'll run out of funds pretty fast.Advance slowly, nothing is gained by moving too fast/finishing quick.

YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Xenonauts Critique (Release Version Review) 

			Views: 4,531		

			An in-depth critique by SwashbucklingSir of the strategic tactical turn-based game Xenonauts, a remake of the classical X-Com series. Does it live up to the spiritual predecessors. Let's find out!		

STORY: Just as in the original X-Com games, extraterrestrial beings attack the earth and the poorly prepared humanity tries desperately to fend off the incoming aggression. Over time we learn to adapt and use the alien technology to our advantage, while at the same time stronger UFOs and aliens try to assault our planet.GRAPHICS: The polished graphics are quite nice and offer a throwback to the old generation, however offering a surprising amount of detail at the same time. Some levels are, by their nature (arctic and desert), rather plain and simple, however other areas are rather impressive.SOUND: The sound design is diffident. It creates a tense atmosphere where not encountering aliens is even worse than having them in sight. The minimal sound effects will make you sit on the edge of your seat as soon as something happens!GAMEPLAY: Both the ground combat as well as the geoscape offer very strategic gameplay and an immense variety due to an array of tactical possibilities! Balancing when to expand your base, which planes to utilise to intercept which UFOs, which equipment to bring for ground assault and when to know that retreat is the best option is key to Xenonauts. The air-to-air combat seems rather shallow though and I found myself using the auto-resolve function most of the time.PROBLEMS: The game does a really poor job of tutorializing itself and thus especially the UI, the cover system and the reaction shot system need a lot of getting used to. Once those initial hurdles have been overcome however, Xenonauts kept growing on me and the more I played, the more strategic options opened up due to the very flexible Turn Unit (TU) system.There are a few minor annoyances like the fact that the soldies customization is incredibly limited since you can only change their name but not face, origin, etc., or the fact that changing equipment is rather time consuming and laborious, or the fact that the UFO's doors close after each turn and thus you always have to put a soldier in harm's way, or the fact that doing an airstrike on a ground target is always worse than actually assaulting the crashsite with your soldiers, even though nothing is to be gained there, resulting in a grind, or the fact that the calculated walk distance sometimes is shorter than it could actually be if you would have optimized the path manually, or the fact that your soldiers cannot utilise their jetpacks to jump over stuff on the highest roof due to level restrictions, etc etc etc. Nontheless, I can forgive all these minor annoyances due to the incredible atmosphere that oozes from Xenonauts, especially when fighting at night in an uninhabited environment.There is one huge problem though, that still hinders me from playing Ironman mode, and that is the camera of Xenonauts. As it cannot be turned and as working with heights is incredibly clunky and frustrating, I feel that improvement on that front is required. Possibile solitions would be to include a rotate option for the camera or the possibility to switch off the walls similar to the Sims games. If no official solution is on the horizon, I hope and feel that the integrated mod support might lead to great solutions provided by the community in the future!COMPARISON WITH ENEMY UNKOWN: Xenonauts has a far greater entry barrier and thus addresses an audience looking for a more strategic experience compared to the latest X-Com game (Enemy Unkown). If you are new to tactical turn-based games, consider checking out X-Com Enemy Unkown with it's Add-On Enemy Within, preferably in a Steam Sale. Should you be looking for a hardcore experience reminiscent of the old X-Com games, consider picking up Xenonauts as it offers not only the tactical turn-based combat but additionally a strategic geoscape, which was simplified heavily in Enemy Unknown.CONCLUSION: Xenonauts is not perfect, however the tactical possibilities and the amazing atmosphere overcome the annoyances and problems. Thus Xenonauts gets a recommendation for every gamer with an interest in tactical-turn-based games.			"

												Did you used to play XCOM back in the day, and now crave a (slightly) more modern experience? Or maybe you played the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and found it a little too... gamey. Well, send in the Xenonauts!COMPARED TO XCOM:Xenonauts is a more user-friendly, streamlined version that replaces clunky UI for more strategic depth. And this game is DEEP. Spend you hard-earned cash on buffing up your wimpy troopers and giving them sweet, sweet gear or spend it like any rational government agency would and buy more bases and jets. Lots of jets. Upgrade those babies. Yeaaaaahhh... that's it. Jets are the future. I know those lasers look pretty, but jets make those governments happy... yeaaaahhhh...Also you'll be happy to find that, although challenging, you won't have your entire team mind-controlled on the third mission.COMPARED TO XCOM:EU or EW:So you have your flashy graphics and simplified UI. But do you have air combat? Do you have the possibility of managing multiple bases around the world? Maybe you just want one base to have xenonauts in it and the rest filled with jets. Maybe you can't aford anything because you are bad at finances. This game has all the strategic depth that XCOM: EU lacks. Pinch those pennies, ladies and gents.In Closing...For those looking for a more management-oriented, strategic experience, Xenonauts will be more satisfying than its flashier cousins. It has its problems, but the free Community Edition fixes the majority of them. I really hope XCOM:EU and its sequels consider adopting the strategic management elements from this game; it makes it a vastly satisfying experience.			"

												Faceblast was an excellent soldier, a true hero, victor of many battles. He had an amazing collection of medals, including multiple purple hearts. He never abandoned his trusty shotgun (well, maybe once when he panicked).His only mistake during his otherwise excellent military career was throwing that grenade. Into his own feet. Killing him. And several of his comrades. Maybe explosives weren't for him?10/10, would throw grenades again. For mankind!			"

												Xenonauts developed by Gamethunks, Goldhawk Interactive & released on 17 Jun 2014 for PC. According to Metacritic (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/xenonauts) it has:    An Average user score of 8.0     #75 Most Discussed PC Game of 2014      #69 Most Shared PC Game of 2014  I'll dare say that Xenoaunts is a great remake of the original XCOM title. If you've played Firaxis's XCOM, you should give this title a try. Both titles differ in many aspect of the game however both are notable titles for the remake of XCOM. Xenoauts on the other hand could do with a little more love and attention for what it's worth.The Story:To keep it short, alien invasion on earth seems immanent and a multi-nationality milatary organization known as XCOM is task to defend our beloved earth from these invaders. Take command of this organization. Build bases across the world, research, manufacture and battle these invaders. One things for sure, soldiers will die. Period.User Interface,Controls, Visuals:The UI on a whole; on battle/soldier/weapon stats window were designed in blocks (nothing fancy), clean and organized unlike the original XCOM where there were tons/clusters of buttons on the  screen.The information are presented in a simple, clean & organized fashion. This also includes research result/aircraft/vehicle capabilities/alien autopsy. This is important because you may need to look them up after some time or after a break.To be real honest, controls are easy. It's quite standard for me really but for some who are new to turn base RTS, they may feel overwhelm on what's being shown on the screen. With the options and bars and what not & freak out far too soon. Or when they see the list of key bindings, the fall off from their chair. Lol. In actual scenario, all you need is the tab key and your mouse. That's it.Visuals:Xeno is a 2d, top-down looking game. It looks good for me. Nothing fancy  if compared to Fira's XCOM. The entire art style looks like hand drawn. Don't get me wrong, it is not a negative point. Everything in here has been designed/colored cleanly with details and a whole lot of effort has been put into the images as you progress with more technology getting unlocked. Unlike Firaxis's XCOM, where its design lean closer for sci-fi futuristic looking gears@soldiers. (those shiny & glowing things) Xeno takes place in cold-war era. Ballistic weapons, bazookas, grenades, tanks and jet fighters. You might feel unimpressed as you are in plain clothing with a standard machine gun/shot gun.  Due to word count limit, I'll just summarize that the human world art concept and the aliens art concept are totally different. Units, ships, weapons are all designed differently but with “realism” still the main point of design. Kudo's on the graphic department. Mechanics:I've said this and I will say this again, beautiful games without substance is no fun. What Xeno (may) lack in visuals, shine in it's mechanics & game play experience. Xeno resembles closer to the original XCOM with greater emphasis on micro managements. It takes a while to understand the weapon handling and on the TU points. Once you do, your gameplay are much more direct. In Xeno, there is no nonsense of that shot missing a 75% or 80% chance. Xeno shooting mechanic is more realistic and is largely affected by the  distance. The good news, there is base building and the aliens can invade your base. They can even build base across the world and you have to disable it. Similar to Fira's XCOM, once you lost majority of the world continent@support, you lose the game. Xeno has better air battles than Fira's XCOM. Air Battles are tricky when you don't have uber jets to fight for you. Some air battles require micro mgt to win. The ground battle is always tedious but rewarding. You need to understand the aliens capabilities and your weapon capabilities to have a decent chance against them. Failing to understand your weapon capabilities will only make you waste turns. Grenades are the highlight of xeno. They are an important asset to storming into room, provide cover and the best way to deal with aliens. Which is why Fira's XCOM later introduce enemy within with more grenade design.Game difficultyTo be honest, I feel xeno is generally harder than Fira's XCOM in the early days until Firaxis released XCOM Enemy within a major bump in game difficulty.I dont feel that the aliens are hard to beat or that this game is hard rather I feel that the game is annoying. Because the aliens capitalize on their advantage and with the constant nuisance from the praetor messing up my squad. But I guess, that’s challenge for you.There's day and night mission as well. Yes, Night missions are harder due to the vision disadvantage. To aid night missions, your entire squad is presented with unlimited amount of flares. It helps in a certain way but not effective enough because the aliens have higher stats then the humans and can shoot further. Oh and their weapon hurt more too. Many have mentioned this and I am going to say this too. Please re-tweak the reapers. They can see players out of the visibility range – they can move in and kill your squad with ease. It is rather an unfair design decision because the reaper only has to poke your unit and say goodbye to whatever Armour/weapon your unit has – or how utterly useless your squad reaction fire is. =(The final mission was really tricky, interesting and freaky suspense. As you try to make it out alive from the endless wave of repears. lol. On a whole, the game felt paced right. You are constantly battling against time for research/manufacture something to give you a slight advantage over the aliens. I use the term ""slight"" because no matter what tech-tree you research unlike in Fira's XCOM, xeno's aliens will always have the upper hand whether its in stats, numbers, weapons. I can share with you the moment I researched tank/super heavy suite/uber 1 blast kill weapon, I thought to myself: ""this it man! this is the game changer!"" but no matter what, if I am careless/I don't plan properly, the aliens will whop my sorry <bottom>. My SummaryXenoauts is a solid product. Thank you Gamethunks, Goldhawk Interactive for this product. While trying to stay true to the original XCOM title, many of the retro/feel/game mechanics have been adopted into this product. You did a great job with Xenoauts.Many might not have heard of xenoauts - unlike Firaxi's XCOM due to marketing approach maybe? But the gameplay experience is on par for both titles. It's not sci-fi and it tries to remain grounded on many of its design choices. Xeno does offer slightly more option for ground battle, where you are able to bring in a whole lot of soldiers (more than 6), the choice of soldier weapons and Tanks. Xeno gives you the option to train your soldier however you want and allows you to equip whatever weapon you so desire. The retro feel is there. Xeno's air battle@base planning will always keep on the edge as you try to cover a part of country/continent and prepare air crafts. All of the micro mgt aspect will allow players to feel more engaged unless you don't fancy that. I am a little disappointed on the ending. Upon completion and saving humanity from the alien invaders, players are presented with a screen of ""hey congrats! you won!"" After all that battle, terror missions, blowing up alien HQs, XX soldiers dead. My reward was 1 screen. Hmph. lol. I love the game, please don't repeat this in future titles. Please give players a much more rewarding ""ending"". Something which if they do share on youtube, people will go ""wow, what a good game. I must get this"" or ""yeah you did good. congrats""So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Xenonauts is a solid 8/10.			"

I played X-COM: UFO Defense to death (I even beat it on the highest difficulty without saving the game) and I've played many other games in an attempt to capture that same gameplay feel, but without success. Until now.This is not merely a re-skin of the old-school X-COM, though it is very familiar. There is enough difference in game experience to keep the game fresh. I enjoyed reading all of the research reports and discovering all over again why the aliens are invading, and how to stop them.The game is challenging, but not overwhelming.

This is important because you may need to look them up after some time or after a break.To be real honest, controls are easy. It's quite standard for me really but for some who are new to turn base RTS, they may feel overwhelm on what's being shown on the screen. With the options and bars and what not & freak out far too soon. Or when they see the list of key bindings, the fall off from their chair. Lol. In actual scenario, all you need is the tab key and your mouse. That's it.Visuals:Xeno is a 2d, top-down looking game. It looks good for me. Nothing fancy  if compared to Fira's XCOM. The entire art style looks like hand drawn. Don't get me wrong, it is not a negative point. Everything in here has been designed/colored cleanly with details and a whole lot of effort has been put into the images as you progress with more technology getting unlocked. Unlike Firaxis's XCOM, where its design lean closer for sci-fi futuristic looking gears@soldiers. (those shiny & glowing things) Xeno takes place in cold-war era. Ballistic weapons, bazookas, grenades, tanks and jet fighters. You might feel unimpressed as you are in plain clothing with a standard machine gun/shot gun.  Due to word count limit, I'll just summarize that the human world art concept and the aliens art concept are totally different. Units, ships, weapons are all designed differently but with “realism” still the main point of design. Kudo's on the graphic department. Mechanics:I've said this and I will say this again, beautiful games without substance is no fun. What Xeno (may) lack in visuals, shine in it's mechanics & game play experience. Xeno resembles closer to the original XCOM with greater emphasis on micro managements. It takes a while to understand the weapon handling and on the TU points. Once you do, your gameplay are much more direct. In Xeno, there is no nonsense of that shot missing a 75% or 80% chance. Xeno shooting mechanic is more realistic and is largely affected by the  distance. The good news, there is base building and the aliens can invade your base. They can even build base across the world and you have to disable it. Similar to Fira's XCOM, once you lost majority of the world continent@support, you lose the game. Xeno has better air battles than Fira's XCOM. Air Battles are tricky when you don't have uber jets to fight for you. Some air battles require micro mgt to win. The ground battle is always tedious but rewarding. You need to understand the aliens capabilities and your weapon capabilities to have a decent chance against them. Failing to understand your weapon capabilities will only make you waste turns. Grenades are the highlight of xeno. They are an important asset to storming into room, provide cover and the best way to deal with aliens. Which is why Fira's XCOM later introduce enemy within with more grenade design.Game difficultyTo be honest, I feel xeno is generally harder than Fira's XCOM in the early days until Firaxis released XCOM Enemy within a major bump in game difficulty.I dont feel that the aliens are hard to beat or that this game is hard rather I feel that the game is annoying. Because the aliens capitalize on their advantage and with the constant nuisance from the praetor messing up my squad. But I guess, that’s challenge for you.There's day and night mission as well. Yes, Night missions are harder due to the vision disadvantage. To aid night missions, your entire squad is presented with unlimited amount of flares. It helps in a certain way but not effective enough because the aliens have higher stats then the humans and can shoot further. Oh and their weapon hurt more too. Many have mentioned this and I am going to say this too. Please re-tweak the reapers. They can see players out of the visibility range – they can move in and kill your squad with ease. It is rather an unfair design decision because the reaper only has to poke your unit and say goodbye to whatever Armour/weapon your unit has – or how utterly useless your squad reaction fire is. =(The final mission was really tricky, interesting and freaky suspense. As you try to make it out alive from the endless wave of repears. lol. On a whole, the game felt paced right. You are constantly battling against time for research/manufacture something to give you a slight advantage over the aliens. I use the term ""slight"" because no matter what tech-tree you research unlike in Fira's XCOM, xeno's aliens will always have the upper hand whether its in stats, numbers, weapons. I can share with you the moment I researched tank/super heavy suite/uber 1 blast kill weapon, I thought to myself: ""this it man! this is the game changer!"" but no matter what, if I am careless/I don't plan properly, the aliens will whop my sorry <bottom>. My SummaryXenoauts is a solid product. Thank you Gamethunks, Goldhawk Interactive for this product. While trying to stay true to the original XCOM title, many of the retro/feel/game mechanics have been adopted into this product. You did a great job with Xenoauts.Many might not have heard of xenoauts - unlike Firaxi's XCOM due to marketing approach maybe? But the gameplay experience is on par for both titles. It's not sci-fi and it tries to remain grounded on many of its design choices. Xeno does offer slightly more option for ground battle, where you are able to bring in a whole lot of soldiers (more than 6), the choice of soldier weapons and Tanks. Xeno gives you the option to train your soldier however you want and allows you to equip whatever weapon you so desire. The retro feel is there. Xeno's air battle@base planning will always keep on the edge as you try to cover a part of country/continent and prepare air crafts. All of the micro mgt aspect will allow players to feel more engaged unless you don't fancy that. I am a little disappointed on the ending. Upon completion and saving humanity from the alien invaders, players are presented with a screen of ""hey congrats! you won!"" After all that battle, terror missions, blowing up alien HQs, XX soldiers dead. My reward was 1 screen. Hmph. lol. I love the game, please don't repeat this in future titles. Please give players a much more rewarding ""ending"". Something which if they do share on youtube, people will go ""wow, what a good game. I must get this"" or ""yeah you did good. congrats""So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Xenonauts is a solid 8/10.			"

Early Access Review
								DISCLAIMER: Review based on early access and on current V1.03 build.  At this time the game is pretty much ready and should be set for official launch in the next few weeks.  Still working on finishing V1.03 build so review will be updated and finalised by official launch. Summary: For all intents and purposes Xenonauts is a modern remake of the ORIGINAL X-COM from 1994.  Where as the modern X-COM Enemy Unknown changed alot from the original, making it more of a action tactical combat game (one that I enjoyed alot) it strayed from the original.  Many a vetran from the original game (including myself) have been clamoring for a remake of the original and, now, I can say, that has happened. Xenonauts remains true to the original and as a player of the old game I was right at home with the controls and mechanics.  To summarise, the game puts you in charge of an organization charged with defending against and alien invasion.  Your main strategic view is the Geoscape, a full map of earth.  You start out by placing your first base whereever you wish.  You must make considerations for how much coverage it will give you and to which funding nations.  You will be able to develope your base, building new buildings, hiring new staff, training new soliders, researching new tech and building new gadgets.  You will outfit your troops and aircraft for battle and eventually build additional bases to increase your coverage.  Soon your first UFO's will arrive.  You will need to intercept them with your aircraft.  This can either be handled via auto-resolve for via an Aerial battle minigame which is surprisingly involved.  Once the UFO is downed (over land) you will send in your troops to retrieve the wreckage and elimate any surviving aliens. From here, the game turns to the Turn Based Tactical map.  Your troops will start in your dropship, and you will have to move them about the map.  This portion uses a turn based system.  Each unit has X amount of time units which they use to perform any action, being it move, shoot, crouch, etc.  Shooting can take up more time units if you want to improve accuracy.  Once you have used up all your time units for all your units, you can end the turn.  Then the aliens will take their move, and it will then go to your turn etc.  Fans of the original and of old school Turn Based will be at home here.  It allows for fine control of each unit and as unit get more experiened, they will get more time units and their other stats such as accuracy, health, reactions etc will also improve. The aim of the game is to defend against the aliens, tech up to be able to match them more evenly and eventuallly defeat the alien menance once and for all. Pros: Playing the game, I felt like I was playing the original...I cannot think of higher praise.  For all intents and purposes this is  the original, given a face lift and brought into the modern world.  It streamlines things a bit, for example, no longer do you have to manufactor basic weapons, nor do you have to manufactor items such as grenades, flairs, and ammo.  This was tedious micromanagement in the original which has thankfully been streamlined now.  Instead, you focus on building weapons, armor, vehicles, planes etc.  Grenades, ammo etc are auto-crafted.  Also, now you have the option of calling in an airstike against a downed UFO instead of sending your combat team.  I remember in the original, during end game it was quite annoying having to deal with smaller UFO's that I shot down, so this is a welcome addition for when you don't want to have to deal with them.  You get a small amount of money doing this, but you gain much more if you send in your assault team.  It's nice to have options. Now you have a wider array of weapons and equipment including Pistols, Shotguns, Shields, Rifles, Machine guns, Sniper Rifles and rocket launchers.  There is a ""class"" system, but basically this is just a set of pre-determined equipment.  You can assign any solider any class.  It is useful for quickly giving units gear and you can set what gear each class gives. The graphics are beautiful 2d graphics and the interface works well now with modern conventions.  Cons:  Alas, all cannot be perfect.  The most pressing issue at the moment is bugs.  Even at V1.03 there are some bugs still left to be addressed, but the dev team is aware of them and looking to fix.  Right now, for me, I get crashes when new gear is made and I go to equip my troops.  Since I save alot, and am now aware of this, it is not more than an annoyance.  I have spoken to the dev's and they are activly trying to fix this.  Maps - While the game has some random placement within maps, it still uses an existing pool.  As such, before long you will be replaying the same maps over again.  The community has already published a map pack to increase the number of maps available.  However, this will always be a problem when not using auto-generated maps. Weapons - A personal issue, but each generation of weapons is literally a more powerful version of the former.  I.e, laser weapons handle exactly the same as the ballistic versions, just more powerful and different ammo counts.  Not an issue, but would be nice to get some more exotic weaponry that differentiates itself a bit more. In ClosingIf you like or are interested in Turn Based games with a strong strategic and tactical element you should give this game a try.  As I said before, when I played this, it was like playing the original X-Com, and I cannot give higher praise than that. 9/10			"

												I love this game. I've never played any actual X-COM games since most of them came out before I was even born so for those of you who want that sort of view point read another review I suppose. Anyways, so far as I'm concerned this is a really great turn-based strategy and while the graphics/animations aren't that great in themselves they are crisp and clean enough when paired with the music and sound to create a very immersive experience. In fact the immersion is really my only complaint about this game, that complaint being that it is too immersive. Seriously. The sound and music of this game is just ♥♥♥♥ing incredible. It really makes you feel like the entirety of humanity is completly screwed cause these aliens with their super advanced technology are here to wreck♥♥♥♥♥♥and kill. Not to mention how attached you get to your soilders. Had this one that had seen some real♥♥♥♥♥♥and been with us since the very beginning with no small number of kills and in one move I killed her. I had her run up to a corner and hide behind some crates then I clicked ""end turn"" and a reaper came around the corner stabbed her and boom turned her into a zombie. In just 3 seconds I had just lost my most experienced and well equiped soilder all because I thought those crates looked like a safe place to hide. The sound she made when she died didn't help either nor the fact that I had to kill her zombified self. It was really quite heartbreaking. This game is immersive and depressing, it will make you contemplate the meaning life, question if anything really matters, and it will keep you coming back 'cause ♥♥♥♥ those alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s welcome to Earf.

												Game is good.Critics:Wish for a little more description on xenopedia (i.e. newly developed spacecraft ammunition).Ground combat sometimes has some bugs, (Shooting through corners, inner map of spacecraft occasionally does not reveal when entering, spacecraft not enterable)Economic has been simplified (which partially makes sense) as in you don't buy standard equipment such as a pistol.But unfortunatley you cannot sell all of the newly found Alien equipment. Price level when selling home made products are set to be unprofitable.Maps set is limited and with the large amount of ground combats you tend to know the map to begin with.I would love to have some option to make use of scout drones.

												Look at all these crazy video games about alien invasions!!! There are many ways you can waste aliens from the comfort of your slowly flattening computer chair. What's Xenonauts all about then? Oh, it's a remake of the original XCOM: Enemy Unknown!Like the original XCOM, aliens invade, you shoot the aliens in the face, etc. Also like the original XCOM: It takes the ♥♥♥♥ing scenic route!!! Seeing through a game of Xenonauts will take a long, long time, and a lot of the time spent will occur in ground combat, where the idiots you're guiding through the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥town or the ♥♥♥♥ forest will need constant adjustment in order not to get blown up (and during the early game, your dudes will get blown up as much as the ones you're shooting, because this game is balls hard. Even on Normal.). The scenic route is made even more scenic-ier, because all the missions start to bleed through and look the same. It's not all tedium - the game allows you to walk into the enemy's UFO, kill everyone inside, and hold it for five turns to win the mission automatically, which is a nice touch. The game is all about destructible environments, so you can take a squad of fast-moving shotgunners, blow a hole in the side of the UFO with a rocket launcher, and win a mission that way. There's all these neat little additions that fit nicely with the original's ethos (saving AP for return fire on aliens dumb enough to wander into firing range). There's also a few unconventional ones to make gameplay less pedantic and fussy, such as allowing unlimited flares on night missions. The developers COULD have not included them, making night missions extremely sucktacular engagements due to a very short LOS and with one soldier having to leave his gun in the dropship to be 'the guy who throws lights everywhere who is shot from behind by some extra-terrestrial ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hiding in a tree'. But they did, and you can throw as many as you want. Yay!So it's kind of bland and it goes on for a long while (a campaign run is in the 50-100 hour ballpark). But it's a neat take on XCOM-style play, and mods are being added by the community to hammer out flaws. It's not going to replace the 2012 XCOM for me, but if you're looking for an update that captures the original very well, give this a shot.			"

Soldiers in cover dying to single shots from enemies across the map (who you are advised to engage at long range), enemies firing through an angle that was 100% blocked for my turn, assault soldiers with high reflex doing nothing as aliens waltz up to their face and one shot them.I was hoping for a version of XCOM:EU with more depth, only got frustration.

												After almost 110 hours of gameplay time, I cannot recommend this game.Let's start with the pros. The air battles are interesting. They certainly are an upgrade to the original XCOM. Unfortunatly, there very few cases where you would want to manually resolve them. Once you reach mid-game, you will in most cases use the autoresolve feature. The kick for playing another XCOM can be a plus if you are a nostalgic.Cons include:* Limited enemies variety. They get stronger, they get more hitpoints and armor but they are just the same.* In about 70% of the cases, your soldiers will die in a single hit. This highly limits all your strategic choices in ground battles.* Still quite a few bugs are present. Mission objectives are wrong, trees appear in ships, soldier can go off map limits, impossible line of sight are visible, there is an annoying looping walking sound effect bug from some standing enemy.* There is a just a single overall strategy: get air superiority ASAP. It is almost impossible to lose once you get it and you can achieve it early on in the game.* Good base locations are limited. There is a pattern that you must follow.* Limited maps variety. You will see them once and you will see them again and again.* Tedious grind. Research is slow and painful. You will be facing many of the same alien waves before you progress and nothing important seems to be happening during that time.* AI is predictable and quite dumb. It won't be looking to get into cover that much, it will always target the solider that is easier to hit, it will only use grenades when you are grouped. It does not try to flank you.* Vehicles are mostly useless. They are often limited to the surrounding area around the dropship because they are too big to go anywhere. They replace 2 soldiers and they are only worth like 1.2 soldier. In the end, you will not be using them. They do not offer enough strategic possibilities.Only buy the game if you are a huge fanatic of the XCOM series, turn-based games, you played them all and the game is on sale.			"

												I like old UFO games and I like the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown (and EW add on and LW mod). I like tactical games. I like turn based games.And I really tried to like Xenonauts. I tried to like it because in theory it's a great game and because I wanted to justify spending money on it. But I couldn't.EVERYTHING in this game is crappy. The first jarring thing is air combat. While in theory very good, it's just too bugged. About 5-10% of my air fights end up in my and enemy aircrafts circling around each other forever at the same spot, and if I try to move my plane it's an obvious suicide, so I can either do that or alt+F4. Other than this annoyance air combat is fine as it is, however, it's much better to just hit autoresolve and spare yourself some irritation from time to time. The next extremely annoying thing is a field of vision of soldiers. It seems they are are incredibly shortsighted to a point they can't see anything over 10 meters away and miss targets that are five meters away by fvkking miles. The best tactic is to run at enemies to stand one meter away from them as in melee fight and then shoot them because otherwise your dvmb♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t4rded soldier will miss or even perhaps kill one of the other squad members shooting in a wrong direction by a 90 degrees. In addition, while the player is walking around the maps almost blindly, aliens always know where the player's units are. Even if they are on the other side of the map they already see you. So skreew you if you wanted to use a short vision against the enemy. The next thing is that aliens just love ""camping"". A bunch of them will just sit in their aircraft with a closed door (so far I did not find a way to just blow upthe whole aircrafts with those t4rrds inside) and wait for you. If you run a soldier over there, they will murder him and close the door. In consequence you just put a bunch of soldiers around  the door, run with one tw4t through the fvkken door and get him shredded due to aliens' reaction fire and then shoot everything inside with the rest of the squad. Every fight same tactics. It's repetitive and boring.While your guys can't shoot anything 5 meters away, aliens seem to have better aim, but that's not even very noticeable. What is very noticeable is that sometimes they shoot from twice your vision or through walls which are impenetrable for your guys. Ultimate trolls.It's also funny to see a fully armored combat vehicle to explode into pieces after a ""bullet"" from the enemy's gun hits it. It looks like a tank exploding after being shot by a gun. Why, what I don't even... either don't put such vehicles in the game if they seem too powerful or make them very expensive, but why put such a vehicle only to be as easily destroyed as a random soldier? Especially when the vehicle takes 6 slots, meaning you could put 6 soldiers on its place? Sure, it has a very powerful gun, but so what if it gets destroyed withing a few rounds.The game also crashes like crazy on Linux. Loading new map... crash. Air combat... crash. New round... crash. I do not recommend this game to anyone. It's a waste of money, time and nerves. If you like old XCOM/UFO, then just play them or go ahead with the modern casualized version that is XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, which is still a great game on its own. Try out the Long War for more fun. But for your own good stay the heck away from a tvrrd that is Xenonauts. I wasted money that would buy me a few sacks of potatoes or some burgers, do not make the same mistake. Actually, don't even buy it when this game will get cheap and hits -75% sales. It's just unplayable.			"

												The Metacritic is actually right on the money on this game.The game is a decent stab at the old x-com game. Interesting setting, faithful to the original game mechanic (both the good bits and not so good bits), nice art direction and basically an enjoyable, stable indie game. Personally I rate this game better than the vanillar XCOM. BUT, the EW expansion and the Long War mod are both far superior to Xeno. Why? Xeno suffers from being a pre-KS funded indie project that presumably had only a modest budget. The later half of the game runs out of steam with generic aliens, bland tech and pure incremental weapons era progression that makes everything kind of dull. WARNING: there are even LESS things to do than in the vanillar XCOM.If you are itching for the classic x-com game and wished XCOM had TU instead, then pick up Xeno for a spin. Otherwise, try the long war mod.			"

												Game too hard for me Im going back to Xcom...I'm really impressed with what Goldhawk Interactive has done in Xenonauts but as I've said before it's harder than Xcom, or at least the RNG really kicks you in the balls and with outragesly bad luck as mine who needs Insane diffuculty.It's pretty much like the old UFO Enemy Unkown interface just improved. But if your luck is worse than mine then you might just lose the whole game just because your Xenonauts can't defend against Psi attacks and guess what unlike an Xcom Warrior, Xenonauts can't learn Psionics so you would have to rely on either bravery or Mods to protect them from the attacks.

												The Metacritic is actually right on the money on this game.The game is a decent stab at the old x-com game. Interesting setting, faithful to the original game mechanic (both the good bits and not so good bits), nice art direction and basically an enjoyable, stable indie game. Personally I rate this game better than the vanillar XCOM. BUT, the EW expansion and the Long War mod are both far superior to Xeno. Why? Xeno suffers from being a pre-KS funded indie project that presumably had only a modest budget. The later half of the game runs out of steam with generic aliens, bland tech and pure incremental weapons era progression that makes everything kind of dull. WARNING: there are even LESS things to do than in the vanillar XCOM.If you are itching for the classic x-com game and wished XCOM had TU instead, then pick up Xeno for a spin. Otherwise, try the long war mod.			"

												Why go throught all the trouble of making such a realistic remake if it is to break all the realism by making the earth flat ?The original XCOM had it all right, the earth was a sphere.  And I'm not just speaking about the type of map projection used, I'm talking about the way aircrafts are travelling, the way radar ranges are depicted and things like that.I don't feel like I'm defending a planet, I feel like I'm defending a flat table with a distorted map drawn on it, or more accurately a cylinder since the map connects on the sides.In this game, on the ''flat map'' globe, the radar ranges are circular, no matter where you are on the globe, well they should'nt, the range of the radar should be factored for the fact that it's a flat map, it should widen towards the poles, otherwise the map is all wrong.  Every aircraft travel in a straight line, just like if the earth was flat, well they should'nt.  The map is distorted, and so are the trajectories and distances.  Now what would be the advantage of putting a base on the north pole, since the distances are so wrong when you consider the earth as a cylinder with very wide poles.  For example, in real life, the shortest route from the southern tip of Chile to Australia doesn't involve going all the way on a due east trajetory, it should be trought the south pole.  ( Where is the south pole anyway in this game ? )  By using such an unrealistic approach to the ''globe'' aspect of the game, it really breaks a big aspect for anybody who liked managing strategically the globe part in XCOM.  Once again, the original game from 20 years ago had it all correct, why change that ?Don't get me wrong, I'm going to recommend this game to any XCOM fan.  XCOM was one of the greatest game of all times and any attempts at bringing back some memories of it should be funded and encouraged.  This remake is an excellent game, with one unnecessary big flaw in my opinion.			"

												I did not play the old X-com games, but I did play the new one, so that will be my frame of reference in this.To me, this game feels like XCOM:EU bashed together artfully with Jagged Alliance 2 - it's got the depth, graphic style, and sometimes gameplay of JA, with the basic concepts and more modern feel of XCOM. The UI is also somewhat JA style, but has been streamlined enough that it reminds me more of Fallout 2's UI. Like XCOM, it has managed to do away with the tedious, forced micromanagement of JA and other games of that period, but does also seem to reward it a bit if you want to take the time to mess with the details, and has made doing so much easier than games from the period this one is trying to emulate.Yeah, reading that sure makes this game sound derivative, doesn't it?That's because it is, and proudly so. And what's wrong with that? Why wouldn't I want a game that looks good enough. lets me tweak things as much or as little as I want, and plays and feels like some of the best games ever?If you are into shiney graphics and found hard difficulty XCOM:EU to be fun and challenging enough, then don't bother with this - the normal difficulty is generally a little more difficult than hard EU.  If you thought it was a great game, but just lacking something to make it a real 700 hour monster time eater, then you should really check this out. If you liked Jagged Alliance or it's modern clone, then you'll love this - it plays very similarly, and the RNG, LOS, and other mechanics are less broken. If liked the quirky gameplay of Fallout 1 and 2 and the darkly comical world, then you'll probably like this, but if you found the combat there overwhelmingly hard, then you might not.One more quick little note: If you haven't played any of the above, but want to get into this sort of games, this is a good place to start. Unlike most of them, the easy mode is actually easy enough fora brand new player to get the swing of things, but becomes challenging enough to be worth playing through to the late game.			"

												You could call Xenonauts a truly faithful remake of the orginial classic Xcom: UFO Defense but is it actually any good or is it just a poor attempt at capturing that unique Xcom feeling like some many games have tried?It's absolutely great! Despite having some minor flaws.Xenonauts is basically a modernised and up-to date version of the classic with it's own little twists and features. Where Xenonauts excels is that it's just a really enjoyable experience. First of all the aesthetics might look pretty bland but they fit the game quite well and everything looks extremely sharp and detailed. There is a lot of great artwork and sprites in this game. The soundtrack totally enhances the threating atmosphere and truly immerses yourself into the game.The gameplay mechanics are mostly identical except that they improved the interface and user-friendlyness. The classic Xcom had a lot of tedious micromanagement and a cumbersome interface. I never particularly enjoyed the logistics aspect of the classic. Xenonauts has a great interface that conveys information in a great manner. Equiping soldiers and manageing your base is far better. The research tree is great aswell and the descriptions add a lot of flavor to the game.The tactical turn-based ground battles are intense and quite challenging thanks to the multitude of difficulties that you can choose from. The geoscape section is also greatly enhanced, the aliens won't hesistate to launch a full scale assault and there is far more to do on the geoscape than in the classic. They also add some nifty new options and events like local military fighting against the aliens as well and airstriking downed ufos.There is much to talk about in this game but I'll keep it short for now, it's a great game for fans of the classics or turn-based games. I definitely recommend it.The only negative aspects that come to mind is that there aren't that many maps, you will often see the same layouts during the battles. Luckily there is a huge mappack available on the official forums that adds tons of detailed and varied maps.Also sometimes the tactical battles can be a bit fiddly on tight spaces and the cover system can be confusing at times, the line of sight works really well but at times it's confusing as well. But once you play for a while you get the hang of it. "

												Addicting!! You control every move. Customize and Detail the loadout of your soldiers, and so many other things... even where they sit in the chopper, to engage once landed however you choose. There's a very small learning curve and then you become hooked on this game. Best Turn-based  Stategy ""SIMULATOR"" I've ever played. I love the attention to details with the game mechanics. If you load too much wieght on a soldier, and engage in combat, your soldier will gain strength for that round(if you get him back alive).   .......There are some mods that make this an even beter game. Thumbs way up!!			"

								A very loyal remake of the original X-COM, Xenonauts is a perfect substitute for people who felt Firaxis' XCOM was too shallow, with only one skyranger and base, and as the creator of the original X-CCOM put it 'the geoscape [feels] irrelevent'. Xenonauts, despite having a much smaller budget and team working on it, manages to capture the spirit of the original game much better than the recent XCOM.			"

												""When it comes down to it, “Xenonauts” is a challenging and at times, gut-wrenching experience…especially if you’re a perfectionist like me.  Watching each one of my soldiers die was a painful reminder of just how unforgiving this game can be.  On the other hand, it makes victory taste all the sweeter.  It’s currently priced at $24.99 (as of 6/19/14), which is a good deal all things considered.  When you consider the amount of play time you’ll spend on one playthru (twenty to forty hours on average), you’ll realize that you’re getting a lot of bang for your buck.  The “XCOM” Firaxis/2K Games remake originally retailed for fifty to sixty bucks, just to put things in perspective.  This game IS worth your time and money, though those who get easily frustrated by difficult games should probably remove all breakables from their immediately vicinity before playing.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/xenonauts/ "

It has the same features that made X-COM such a tense and memorable game, with base invasions and a gigantic open-ended campaign of depth and freedom. Game is not dumbed nor mainstreamed version of Firaxis take on futuristic version of XCOM, but opposite - expanded of current generation game features and more.Xenonauts is the best possible tribute to an evergreen masterpiece like the original X-COM.

												I never got the chance to play the original X-Com.  I heard the legends, of course, of all the things it did right that no other game (incuding newer X-Com titles) had managed: the perfect balance of weapons and gear so that every type of loadout has its use, the punishing yet fair difficulty (the aliens are stronger than you, but it's always possible to beat them), the general sense of dread at every crash site, the amazing metagame of base building and resource allocation across continents, and so many other features that added up to an amazing, tense, immersive, and satisfying experience.I cannot say if Xenonauts is as good as X-Com, or how the two compare, but I can say this: Xenonauts does everything right.  It sounds crazy to say, but it's true.  The balance of both your equipment and enemies', especially with the latest patches and Community Edition, is perfect.  Both the metagame and tactical encounters are complex and satisfying.  Every choice, every action has weight, tension, and immense significance to your war with the alien threat.  Battles are tense, tactics are paramount; your soldiers' survival is tenuous, but if you use the right tactics, there is hope.So, I cannot say if Xenonauts is as good as X-Com was, but I can say that it is as good as X-Com's hype, which is even more impressive.

												For those who loved X-Com: UFO Defense/UFO: Enemy Unknown and want to have roughly the same experience as that 20+ year old game with the benefits of modern technology, then this is the game for you. Big battles, multiple bases, and a pretty severe difficulty. But there is new stuff too, like a better interface, a variety of neat toys to use against the aliens, and much more. On the downside, It can get a bit repetitive over time as you send a team to clear out yet another UFO you shot down, but I guess that just adds to the atmosphere of an endless conflict where you are badly outnumbered and outgunned. But you can fix that in time, of course. Still, this game will eat up alot of time, so be prepared for a major time commitment if you are planning on playing this to the end.Save the world from the aliens! Yey.			"

												+ x-com esque + mod support (actually without the mod kinda feels like an unfinished game)- the UI would be confusing for first timer in this kind of genre- feels too indie-ish which not a bad thing, but would be a major turn off for most newcomer i think.  and many moreoverall 4 0f 5 would recommend to any x-com or other tactical turn based series fans. for the rest of other type of gamer try to stick with the game for a few hours, read a lot of guide and don't forget to add mod to be able to enjoy this.

												This game is as close as I've seen to a ""clone"" of a previous game. That being said, the game it is cloning (X-com, the original) was a 5-star classic, and this version of it is actually quite good. Xenonauts managed to preserve nearly all the best parts of the original, while fixing some of its bigger flaws (especially in regard to the user interface) and avoiding introducing any new negative elements that step on the experience. I also played the X-com reboot, which enjoys the triple-A budget and graphics lacking in Xenonauts, and find Xenonauts to be the much better game. The X-com reboot forces you to choose (over and over) from a set of missions where you can only do one from the set (and the aliens win automatically in the places you opted not to go). I really, really -hate- that mechanic. Xenonauts gives you multiple threats at the same time, but gives you the option (over time, if you play well) to build multiple bases, acquire more interceptors, bomb the crashed alien ships you can't or don't wish to engage on the ground, even run multiple dropships full of troops, letting you eventually build up to where you can deal with more than one of those threats successfully -- perhaps even all of them, in some cases. That, I found, to be much more satisfying than the heavy-handed ""pick one and only one"" mission to do, where you are forced to sit and watch the world burn everywhere else. X-com2 is about to come out, and it looks like more of the same: smaller squads, only one base, only one dropship, a very heavy hand from the designer, channeling you down the road the way he wants you to travel at, at the pace he sets. Probably still has that cheap design shortcut of aliens not spawning on the map until you trigger their scripted appearance, when they always get a free move on you. (You can never catch them by surprise: there is no strategy that will let you get the drop on any of them at first encounter). Whereas in Xenonauts, the enemy units behave under the same rules you do: they are all on the map at the start of the combat and have to move using the same kind of Time Units restrictions that your troops must endure. You can lure some of the more aggressive alien types in to traps or crossfires, while others will patiently set traps for YOU that you have to figure out how to deal with. Luck plays a smaller role in Xenonauts, so of course that is the game that I favor.Do yourself a solid and pick up Xenonauts instead of the Xcom reboots. It's fun, challenging, and highly replayable, with more emphasis on strategy and tactics, more room for creativity and variation in how you tackle the challenges, and has more of the goodness that made the original X-com so special.

												I was excited about this release back in 2013 but for many reasons have not gotten around to it until recently. I don't have a lot of hours in yet but all I can say is WOW. This is the most faithful reproduction of X-COM: Enemy Unknown by a wide, wide margin - and that's no knock on the recent reboot by Firaxis; they are simply dramatically different games. Xeno distinguishes itself with the faithful depth and unforgiving, unapologetic tactical harshness that is carried by poor or reckless decision making. It is amazing that we have both XCOM and Xeno, and that they are both such great games and I found a fantastic article below by Phil Hartup that dives so well in to exaclty this topic and provides an excellent history of what the franchise has gone through. Absolutely worth the time to read if your exposure to the franchise is rooted larely in the recent reboot, and if you loved the classic from 1994 and have, like so many of us, given up hope of a faithful reproduction after decades of disappointment - this is a slam-dunk to run long nights in to the dawn.http://www.newstatesman.com/killing-time/2013/10/xcom-enemy-unknown-xenonauts-dumbed-down-game-any-less-fun "

It does feel almost as dated but that's almost certainly an artistic choice (I would guess to relate more to early 90s squad tactics games), it isn't the flashiest but it looks really nice for 2D Iso artwork.Workshop items are also fantastic! everything seems to work flawlessly and there are some really interesting mods out there, a few even drastically change major parts of gameplay, adding a few more layers of depth.You definetly feel like you're working with the NSA and MIB when your deep into a game.

												I really love & hate this game. The entire premise is fantastic. What I really hate is that aircombat is frustratingly stupid (fighters won't fire their missiles even when they have a lock sometimes). Ground combat has the oddity of even seasoned soldiers overreacting and shooting your own guys when they see an alien. These buggy bits could be argued to be realistic... but only slightly. Also everytime your soldiers are in sick bay and then come back they conveniently forget all the items they were carrying into battle before. I know you can make new roles... but it's all a huge pain in the rear.You can't lob a friggin grenade anywhere you can't visually see... which is pretty much how grenades are supposed to be used.The ultimate armored suit doesn't seem to be that effective (pretty sure my guy gets hurt just as much in that thing as out of it.Berserking is stupid... your guy will decide to turn around and shoot his own people.Also... no one warned me you could lose countries and not gain them back. Even though the death toll only states there's a few thousand killed. It makes no sense unless the aliens really did cleanse the earth in those places, which they didn't.This has the makings of a great game. Xenonauts 2 will hopefully improve upon this because the idea is really really great in conception but not execution. Just too many frustrating things (especially the combat that leaves a 95% burst with 0 rounds impacting on target) Also the heavy machine gun should carry about 200 rounds per drum... but you only have 30 rounds per.

												What I can add to the stuff all others already wrote: This is indeed an X-com clone without any additions, but it's very well made. Combat especially works very good (although not as simple as the new Xcom games).There are two cons:* The interface is clumsy and you will have a hard time finding out what is where for a few hours.* There aren't many exciting features as in X-com 2 or 3. Plain old R&D.Still, I've got this game from a bundle and I'm glad I'm playing it. Decent challenge, nothing is really broken, and customizing your troops is fun.			"

It has the same features that made X-COM such a tense and memorable game, with base invasions and a gigantic open-ended campaign of depth and freedom. Game is not dumbed nor mainstreamed version of Firaxis take on futuristic version of XCOM, but opposite - expanded of current generation game features and more.Xenonauts is the best possible tribute to an evergreen masterpiece like the original X-COM.

Even if you do everything right, there's a good chance one of your guys will take a fatal shot. This game is brutal, but rewarding, and will give you all kinds of entertaining stories of how your team took on the alien invasion.

												I'm a huge, HUGE fane of the original X-Com.  I was really looking foward to this game and hoped an indie company could restore the glorius gameplay that was X-com -- but they fall short.They really try to be true to the source material, but nothing quite meshes.  Graphics and animations are meh and the A.I. still makes those magical shots from 300 yards away, around the tree, under the car, through the two house windows -- killing your soldier instantly.  On the other end of the spectrum, you will miss the alien standing next to you, with a plasma shot gun and 99% CTH -- and if you are lucky enough to hit it, it will take a whopping 5% damage, while the other 7 of your soldiers will panic, drop their gun, and run right up to the enemies for a merciful quick killing.It's very frustrating, to say the least.  So close, but so far.			"

												FINAL RELEASE REVIEW: This review was originally a negative review. It turned into a positive one, and now it's negative. Prepare for a rant.Xenonauts still feels like it's in beta. Civilian A.I is stupid. You can't tell them to stay put; they still run around like idiots and get killed. The game pretends the aliens have moved. A lot of the time, you won't be able to see an alien after your team JUST took potshots at it. You will have to move up a squadmate (wasting that soldier's TU) so that you can see the alien again, which has not moved. The game's rendering system is RIDICULOUS. Here's an example: I activated C4 on the front door of an alien ship. The turn ended. The area where the fire should have been was dark. It seemed like the C4 failed. I brought my soldier up and he walked into fire that didn't even render until he stepped on it. Seriously? Also, if you have your tank (hunter scout car) blow up in front of the UFO doors, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You can't open the doors, shoot through the tank, get on top of it, or push it away. The animations are lacking severely. The doors just snap; there isn't any cool animation of their opening. The geoscape takes a bizarre amount of time to load, too. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing PICTURE, not some 3D holographic image from XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The soldiers are ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ too. Am I hiring my family members and people off the street to join my organization or something? Like I said, this game still feels like it's in beta.			"

												I just love this game, brings me back to my childhood where I played these type of games.Spent countless hours on turnbased games. This game is worth buying, great graphics, great gameplay, works on linux (I play mainly on that).Gameplay is easy to get into, you can just start and go with it. The AI is great, and you get a lot of curveballs as you play, that keeps you on the edge of your seat for sure.			"

												More Reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comIf you were looking for the spiritual successor to the X-Com franchise, Xenonauts feels like the game you’ve been waiting for. Even though The Buraeu: X-Com Declassified and Enemy Unknown/Within were great games in their own right, they just didn’t quite capture the same feeling that the classic games had. While some things need to evolve and change, there’s something to be said about making a recipe with most of the same ingredients to enjoy the meal you remember. (That’s especially true if they are going to say that it tastes similar.) I covered a lot of the basics of this game in the X-Com: Enemy Unknown VS. Xenonauts review so I’m not going to cover everything since Goldhawk Interactive finished up everything that needed fixing to transition from Early Access to Launch status pretty smoothly.Let’s start with difficulty shall we? That was a trademark aspect of the originals. (I still can’t complete TFTD.) I started Xenonauts on the Regular difficulty and had both starter interceptor planes shot down in one-on-one dogfights. (At which point I had nothing to shoot down enemy aircraft.) The enemy craft ended up landing after downing my two aircraft giving me my first mission… out of pity. During the pity mission (which happened to be a night mission of course) I had lost two soldiers before I got ten spaces from my Chinook from enemies I couldn’t see. Needless to say I started over and changed the difficulty to easy. I usually don’t like playing games on easy, but this game just kicked me in the nuts and laughed in my face.Thinking that the game was going to be too easy after the difficulty was changed was a bad assumption on my part. That little dead alien in the corner reminded me that I shouldn’t let my guard down. This little bugger skirted around the edge of the map taking pot shots at my guys almost killing two of them. I was throwing out flares left and right to try to find him to no avail. I eventually found him by sending one soldier randomly to the side of the map and just happened to spot him. Needless to say, when he became visible, the bullets went flying.Moving on, research has been overhauled to be more convenient for the player. Let’s just say that you go out on your first mission and you clean house very well. When you get back to base you have only a few options to research, general concepts like alien electronics or alien interrogations if you managed to capture an alien alive. What about the dissections and the alien craft that you left behind? Well, it’s being taken cared of. That’s being done behind the scenes and you’ll get that info in good time and the other related research options therein. You still have plenty of things to research so don’t feel robbed here; Xenonauts makes research feel streamlined.Another interesting note is that wounded soldiers heal more realistically. This is a neat update while at the same time pretty frustrating. I liked it when people just took a few days off and then poof they were combat ready and good-as-new. In Xenonauts they take time to become combat ready with reduced stats and even more time to fully recover. When the number of days are up for your soldier to enter the field again, they are given a percentage of how much they’ve recovered. You’ll have less health to run around with and lose when you get shot. As time goes on, they do get better, but that’s with time.There are plenty of different looking locals between deserts, desert bases, towns, farms and enemy bases. They have different maps for the same type as well so you’ll never really feel that “you’ve been here before”. That is a very nice feature, because few things feel as cheap than reused levels. Some may call the graphic choice dated, but not only does it look nice aesthetically, the devs do a great job setting a creepy atmosphere with it. I really like the presentation of Xenonauts.One last note, the NPCs in Xenonauts are freaking amazing. Some are just helpless civilians and do stupid civilian things, but the guys with guns (soldiers and farmers) actually use thier guns to defend themselves. I’ve had some levels be finished by some random farmer killing an alien before my guys got to the part of the map. Well played Goldhawk Interactive, well played.Score: Tasty!There is a lot to love here for fans of tactical games. Nothing feels rushed and sometimes that’s a concern people have when games come out of Early Access. It’s all smooth running and gunning here. With the varied locals and very nice looking isometric scenery, there is some really good “retro” (if you want to call it that) eye-candy to be had. Goldenhawk Interactive doesn’t go out of their way to revamp the series with light blooms and next-gen graphics. They pull from what made the originals so great and modernize it. I have nothing bad to say about Xenonauts (especially since they allow me to lower the difficulty setting). I will try a harder difficulty later, but as of now I appreciate having my ego padded a little more.			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing fun, Its just like the old xcom with all its gut crushing core.The AI is just insane, it gets crazy sometimes. If you play on ""Hard"" and Up, don't expect to win most of your battles. The battles are not ""unfair"" you can win everyone but you need to be near perfect in your tactics. If you don't like the  pace of the game, there are many modpacks to give it that Insane ( one grenade blows up football field) style like the old xcom. I perfer to use the Journey into Darkness Mod on the Mod forums in Xenonauts.			"

8/10, Very good gameReview is for default v1.59 game. For enchanted playthrough, see notes about CE-version.True successor in the spirit to the UFO: Enemy Unknown (1994), its sequel Terror from the Deep (1995) and Microprose's latest 'UFO-colors' game, X-Com: Apocalypse (1997).Earth is under the attack by menacing alien forces which are gathered around the Earth orbit. Player is tasked to command Xenonaut-organization and plan the battle against this threat. Game consists of two parts: Geoscape where strategic planning happens and tactical turn-based combat which is heart & bone of the UFO-games.When compared to it's predecessors, game plays fairly lot in the same way. On Geoscape you build your own bases and try to maintain air superiority. Xenonauts get their (small) funding from the continents of the Earth. So one of the top priorities is build air superiority cover over the world parts if you want to receive spending money in the upcoming months. Air superiority means that you have to acquire interceptors, research upgrades to keep your edge up and shoot down UFOs. In addition of embarking to turn-based battle, any UFOs shot down could be airstriked for fixed sum of money and saved real world time.Aliens seem to first have problems to enter inside Earth atmosphere except with small crafts but that is rapidly changing. Therefore ground combat also has an important role: you acquire alien artefacts and your hired soldiers will get more experience. Increasing your soldier's statistics is one game aspect where you prepare to the end game. Also as this is an UFO-game, there are some inevitable combat losses which means you need to keep up healthy sized pool of soldiers. Also you have to protect your bases which usually means keeping the garrison on the base.On turn-based you get usual TB-game mechanics, with mid-turn interrupts and soldier movement is limited by 'time units'. Game design blunders are mostly avoided: xeno-soldiers can 'peek' from the corner facing diagonally towards it. Protection and cover is calculated only using the largest blocking object, making the decisions very simple. Weapons are labelled in very generic categories instead of giving you multitudes of the same. Assault rifle is an assault rifle, until you get a laser rifle (which works in exactly same way). This means you could pick generic weapon genre and chosen weapon would work in that role as expected. Combat system sounds very simple, but in practice it's working. Sure, you could have bad luck with the dice roll and aliens might get lucky shots, but that's UFO for you... do not leave your soldiers to the line of sight. :-)However, some things does not exist even advertised, like jumping through windows or are not advertised at all even they are actually useful (melee attack). Structural damage seems quite mild and there are no spectacular building collapses and wild-fires like in Apocalypse. Game will still have some irritating bugs for which I seriously considered score of 7 from 10. Also I would have liked to have several dropships on the same mission to train my rookie hordes, but you can't get everything, eh? Until you realize there's modders community...Interface works enough well to do it's job. That's all I have to say which means it's pretty mediocre, simplistic but it won't get in your way. Some people on forums have commented on lack of tablet/touch screen support.To the credit of the writer every game tech has fairly convincing description how this particular piece fits to the game universe. Even the upgrade works in exactly same way - like assault rifle works technically exactly as plasma rifle  - there is explanation how this particular piece of technology would affect the game universe. Also game soundtrack consists only of few pieces, but these are fairly moody.If you have waited all these years to pickup old UFO/X-Com and play again, look no further than Xenonauts. Game package additionally contains a short novel. Fairly generic reading, but entertaining enough and it adds to the game lore.Edit: To avoid already fixed bugs and errors in the game, you may want to use Community Edition (CE) version for your first playthrough. You can install CE version through the Steam.			"

								The old XCOM is back!  If the XCOM enemy within and this one merged it could be the super game it could be. Both games are missing things the the other has.  Love the multiple bases, the base play and air game of the Xenonauts but its missing the newer XCOM enemy within metals, training school, MECHs, Gennetics and a few other things.  Overall it is a great game that could be upgraded to be Epic.			"

Its better then the new xcom imo.other then the gfx. This game will crash  when in the troops inventory screen,it will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.(the update to fix this bug is fail) No psi lab in this game to make your troops better at reciving mind attacks...so..you will only hire rookies with high bravery 55-65+ off the rip,cause bravery as a stat only increses if you survive mind attacks.And when you get medals. I changed the gameconfig file so all rookies stats are min 65 max 65.also no night vison for these troops,so night missions are avoid at all cost. i know pretty whack for a game with plasma guns and jetpack armorOther things to mention with the ground combat(night or day) Troops will shoot cover their behind while aiming at a guy 40 feet away..(past lame) as if the combat script is that dumb,,,it is. Cause even your highest rank troops COL, down to the new guys will pretty much shoot their feet all the time.wasting ammo,lifes and really just start to get under your skin. But after you get about 8 guys built up a bit,you will not need cover. The price for the game is imo,way to much. it should be around 10 bucks.But this game is very easy to mod. So most things you find you do not like,change it.			"

Just do it, this taught me so many lessons. It is because of this game I might survive the next major world confict by KEEPING MY DUMB♥♥♥♥♥IN FULL COVER.This game is almost perfect, minus a few graphical glitches and the fact that it is low res. It is one of my favorite games I have ever played, I wish they could translate this to modern graphics soon.Top 5 game. If it is on sale and you don't buy it, you've cost yourself an opportunity.

								If you had any fun at all playing the original X-com games, then this game is perfect for you. It sucessfully takes the old X-com and improves it in every way it can. Whilst still a bit unfair in aerial combat, most of the game is greatly balanced, and by that, I mean you will get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you on a daily basis. So yeah, the original X-com difficulty returns. Your troops still have the accuracy of a drunk stormtrooper, carry weapons that are about as effective as Nerf guns loaded with napkins, and wear laser attracting magnets on their faces. It's awsome.Edit:The game is out now! And a sequel has been anounced!I can't wait to name my soldiers after people I know and cry when they inevitably die all over again.			"

								Okay.Painstakingly handselected loadout for 8 soldiers - Check.Strategically placed them inside the carrier - Check.Let's go.The door opens. A farm. How quaint.A single smoke grenade rolls out, as 2 troopers with shields rush through and draw sightlines.... nothing.Still clear.Flanks covered, a man with a huge shield keeping an eye on the rear as the rest of the squad move onward.A panicked farmer runs towards us. The men hold their fire.2nd shield rounds the first corner and CONTACT.Alien spotted.Wait. Hold on.All my men are clustered pretty close, but I don't think aliens will have grenades or area effects on day 1.Hmm.I can use a missile to blow out the wall between the alien and my full squad, using only my rocketeer's turn - everybody else gets to fully unload on the first alien I encounter.It will be glorious.I click the rocketeer.... how do I target the enviroment?Ah, click the weapon again, I see.Now, let me make sure I have the rocketeer selected and click him aga...Oh.My entire squad minus 2 shield guys is now pink goo.10/10Will play again.

After the mission i had lost 6 out of 8 people. 2 died because doors did not count as cover. 1 vaporized because the woman with the rocket launcher does not know how to shoot. Another died because they panicked and ran towards the alien. Another died because i didn't know what a reaper does. A final one died from the hands of her own team mate's machine gun because the machine gunner could not tell the difference between aliens in humans. 10/10 would play again best game ever please make a xenonauts 2.

I changed the gameconfig file so all rookies stats are min 65 max 65.also no night vison for these troops,so night missions are avoid at all cost. i know pretty whack for a game with plasma guns and jetpack armorOther things to mention with the ground combat(night or day) Troops will shoot cover their behind while aiming at a guy 40 feet away..(past lame) as if the combat script is that dumb,,,it is. Cause even your highest rank troops COL, down to the new guys will pretty much shoot their feet all the time.wasting ammo,lifes and really just start to get under your skin. But after you get about 8 guys built up a bit,you will not need cover. The price for the game is imo,way to much. it should be around 10 bucks.But this game is very easy to mod. So most things you find you do not like,change it.			"

Early Access Review
								Okay.Painstakingly handselected loadout for 8 soldiers - Check.Strategically placed them inside the carrier - Check.Let's go.The door opens. A farm. How quaint.A single smoke grenade rolls out, as 2 troopers with shields rush through and draw sightlines.... nothing.Still clear.Flanks covered, a man with a huge shield keeping an eye on the rear as the rest of the squad move onward.A panicked farmer runs towards us. The men hold their fire.2nd shield rounds the first corner and CONTACT.Alien spotted.Wait. Hold on.All my men are clustered pretty close, but I don't think aliens will have grenades or area effects on day 1.Hmm.I can use a missile to blow out the wall between the alien and my full squad, using only my rocketeer's turn - everybody else gets to fully unload on the first alien I encounter.It will be glorious.I click the rocketeer.... how do I target the enviroment?Ah, click the weapon again, I see.Now, let me make sure I have the rocketeer selected and click him aga...Oh.My entire squad minus 2 shield guys is now pink goo.10/10Will play again.

												As a huge fan of Turn Based Strategy games, and being raised on X-Com (Still own the floppy discs) I have to say if you're looking for a spiritual successor to the original games this one matches it the closest.If you're familiar with the original X-Coms this game will seem very familiar to you. The game falls into two categories of gameplay. A globe you must monitor, while in this ""Geoscape"" the world will go through day and night cycles. During this time you can set scientists to research, Workers to manufacture, and slowly build from a tiny strike force into a globe encompassing powerhouse as you aquire more and more alien technology and information of what they are doing on earth. The key to this part of the game, is sending out fighters to have aerial battles in a very neat radar style where you move your fighters around to position for maximum effectiveness, or to eventually touch down your transport vehicles to enter the next stage of the game.The second part is where the core of the gameplay lies. A turn based isometric game. Rather than diverging away from the original and giving them 2 actions like the new X-Coms. Characters have AP, meaning all of your abilities must be carefully calculated for the perfect shot or just to hope you can run far enough away after missing and shouting out loud at your computer.  These points can also be used for a variety of abilities, from weaponry to alien technologies.The gameplay feels very genuine and solid, you'll never curse the game for slip-ups, as it's quite informative about how much AP an action or moving will work. Although knowing if something will still be blocking your shot can be somewhat confusing. The feeling of moving inside of an alien ship will fill you with as much dread as it used to. The only issue that ever came up was spotting enemies and still not seeing them in game.I was a bit skeptical about the price as I suppose I've been spoiled by steam, but this game is definitely worth it as of now. Although some of the art assets seem a bit out of place and a bit to cartoon like, the art inside the turn based is smooth and polished enough to recognize what's happening. And notice some very nice cosmetics, particularly the exterior of  the alien ships.In terms of soundtrack, you'll find it quite suspensful which is always a pleasure on games like this. The sound effects are crisp, and hearing an alien scream as you shoot across the map will give you a little fist pump moment.Honestly pick this one up and support the devs. Have fun with it and know this is one of the best successors to those old games you loved.I'd give it a 9/10, my only qualms are some of the art assets, and a few technical issues. Beyond that it's been a great game!			"

												Everything that was awesome about XCOM:UFO Defense is in this game.  If you don't know what XCOM: UFO Defense is than you are probably up past your bedtime, and your mommy is gonna get mad at you.  So go to sleep. Then wake up and download XCOM: UFO Defense, and play it with DOSBOX.  It was probably the most popular and influential turn based tactical combat game ever, in its day.    "

Everything generally takes forever and the menus aren't intuitive how to navigate. About the only plus I'm seeing right now is better graphics.Pro-tip: Buy the original XCOM and get OpenXCOM mod for it to make it playable on modern hardware.

												I'ts great...  But Another game where the aliens NEVER miss but you will fire shot after shot after shot after shot and every time they will miss.  It's just not fun to play.  I'm 1 and a half hours into this.  And my soldiers HAVE NOT landed more than a single, solitary, hit on the enemy.  I have had to keep reloading and trying again.  I think this is what people call ""hard core"".  Yeah - I haven't even managed yet to get all my troops off the back of the helicopter.  It's like that bit in Saving Private Ryan, at the beginning where they are trying to get off the life boat things, except the American's can't hit a thing and they have machine guns, and the germans have a pistol and every shot they fire kills a GI.All of the XCom games have sort of done this and I've always thought it sucked.  The worst were the games in the UFO trilogy.  I imagine that this game NEEDS you to have a maxed out Stat squad to stand a chance later on in the game?  So you simply CAN NOT tollerate taking a casualty?  Is it another of those?  Because if you have to replace someone with a Private later on and they come out like this.....The game has been a hugely dissapointing and not-really-fun waste of an hour and a half so far.			"

												If you loved original Xcom/Ufo from Microprose you will love Xenonauts. Its almost 100% remake with few upgrades. There are also mods to make your game even more similar to original (music sounds etc) I had a lot of fun with firaxis official remake, but lets be honest it was very simplified compared to original. Xenonauts its only way to bring you 100% xcom experience. 9/10+ its almost 100% mechanical clone of original xcom/ufo+ very engaging and demanding but well balanced and rewarding game+ combat missions have this special mood of original game+ dogfights are much better then in original+ full mod support can make game even more original like- graphics are very outdated, its not a big deal in game like that but still they could done better job- some alien races are not well designed- cryssalid (reapers) are not even close so scarry and demanding like in original  "

												This game feels a lot like XCOM: EU where all they did was remove the best parts of the game but this time they did it even worse. The only thing great about this game is the workshop, because the vanilla game is actually pretty bad.You see, what made you invested in the tactical part of the game was the alien loot you could grab when you finished the mission. From there you could continue your research, or if you were low on funds, sell it to foreign powers. That was the best part of the game, manufacturing weapons, and then selling them to the governments of the world. It allowed you to continue funding science projects, and recruit staff had the odds swung against you. Sometimes you couldn't get enough missions or things didn't turn out right, and a few nations stop funding your project.That was removed, and from what it seems, the political aspect as well. You aren't trying to convince the governments of the world that your project can work. You seem to just get a set amount of income each year, I don't know who funds us, or why, we just get money.Well, I can take a good challenge, tough aliens, and the great level design the game throws at me. But the most disgusting part of the game is aiming. This game takes XCOM's difficulty over the top. While yes, enemies did cheat a bit, but there were few times when they could shoot through walls. But the game's difficulty doesn't come from enemy health, uniqueness, or powers or even intelligence. No. The game's difficulty comes from your soldier's ability to aim, alone. I find it hard to be invested at all in this game, with the ability to sell loot, manufacture items, or attempting to convince the UN that the xcom project works. I find it even harder to invest myself when soldiers shoot like idiots.You can have 1 alien surrounded by four soldiers, and have ALL of them miss. You can have the odds in your favor, the perfect LOS, and miss. What? You don't think it's that bad? ""It might not be that bad, I'll give it a go"" Let me give an example of how BAD a soldier's aim is:There was an alien in a ship, the door destroyed by my rocket launcher. I took my heavy weapons soldier, told her to fire at the alien inside of the ship. You know what she does? SHE TURNS AROUND AND SHOOTS THE SOLDIER NEXT TO HER. SHE UNLOADS ON THIS POOR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LIKE SHE WAS INJECTED WITH ADAMANTIUM RAGE. KILLING HIM INSTANTLY.This game has so much potential, but it's like the developers thought the only way to make aliens any kind of threat was to nerf your soldier's aim. Down to the point where they couldn't even shoot an alien that's in a square next to them. Stuff like this NEVER happened in xcom, in xcom YOU'D HIT! But you were never sure if you were going to KILL!Also, the morale in this game feels so screwed up! Your soldiers would take one hit, and then immediately go beserk? The last time I played xcom, your soldiers would only go beserk if someone DIED. In fact, beserking soldiers were actually pretty rare if you kept everyone alive. And even if I'm wrong on this, they should fix it, soldiers should not beserk or panic after getting hit once.This game is frustrating but I feel like the workshop fixes some of it's problems.			"

If you are interested or someone who played already without mods, for all of you who likes the game or hated it, i recommend you to use XCE version aka Xenonauts Community Edition which got tons of fixes and new things. After you finished XCE version, you can try X-Division mod created by a dedicated team leading by me. We aim to create X-Com exprience.Join us at Goldhawk forums!			"

												This game makes you feel like the first time you played x-com. Instead for going into alot of details, let me say i always read the negative reviews on games before buying anyhing,Now- this game really is entertaining, it is enjoyable and easy to play,  but remember you will be extinct if you stick your neck to far out.Is it worth 25us?!Yes it is.!

												This homage/ripoff of the original 1994 version of X-COM is generally updated and improved, but is actually more clunky and awkward by the standards of its time than the now old-enough-to-drink original game. There's no tutorial (and the game DESPERATELY needs one), you can't rotate the camera in combat, preparing your squad for combat is needlessly split across three different areas of the base, soldiers are MORE difficult to tell apart in combat than the original game because every race and gender has the exact same sprite (except for the weapon it carries).There's just NOT enough effort here to make things clear. In air combat YOUR planes show how much HEALTH they have left, but alien ships show the reverse - how much DAMAGE they have taken (remember that bit in the Bruno movie about the importance of consistency?). You can only see your weapons' stats at base (and only in a particular place at base - can't examine the weapon your soldier is actually holding, no sir, we don't like that kind of basic UI consistency around these parts, Yankee!). In combat, you don't even get to see how many Time Units you need to reload a gun - the reload button just beeps at you if you don't have enough. And don't get me started about the horrible system for reserving Time Units to shoot your gun, which doesn't reserve the Time Units you need to be able to actually turn towards the target so you can shoot it (would anyone really object if they just let you turn for free when you attack, like in the Rebelstar game on Gameboy?!)Oh, and the art and sound are just nowhere as good as the original X-COM. X-COM's blurry VGA graphics didn't age well, but at least all the aliens looked scary instead of goofy (well, maybe not those dumb Floaters or that Jello alien) and you could clearly tell which room in the base was which - you can't say that about Xenonauts. And a chill still goes up my spine whenever I hear that blaster bomb sound effect used on TV for something else.You can make a strong argument that X-COM 2012 lost some of the original's charm with ""gamey"" elements and being dumbed down, but it also had some clear improvements that Xenonauts is sorely lacking. Despite 2012's many terrible design choices, it's still clearly the true sequel to X-COM.			"

												This game was not made in a vacuum. If it were not for XCOM: UFO Defense, I doubt this game would have been made. That being said, it is more than fair to strictly compare Xenonauts to XCOM:UD and the latest, much more streamlined, XCOM: Enemy Unknown.Given the choice between XCOM:EU and this, I would choose the former. The over-simplification of XCOM that Xenonauts sought to address is no longer a concern once The Long War mod is installed. Xenonauts' incredibly plain graphics and visual design are something I just cannot get past. Everything about it is pure blandness. XCOM has unique visuals, and most importantly, small graphic nuances during the tactical combat that makes it feel like a thrilling shootout. Xenonauts on the other hand is a VERY by the numbers turn-based tactical game.			"

												It's great to finally see a game that lives up to the x-com legacy. It tries its own thing here and there and most of the time it manages to improve on the concept. It is not perfect, but it is a damn well realized vision and re-imagining of the original X-Com formula. If you enjoy strategy games in general, or turn-based squad combat in particular, it's a no-brainer. Buy it. Will not disappoint.			"

Early Access Review
								Xenonauts is quite ok game honestly, but do not expect too much. It is slightly modernized X-COM and that's all.Graphics is indie-good. Transition to Cold War times is a nice move and ufo-generated events (abductions, crop circles etc.) adds a lot to the game creepy atmosphere. The story... well, I can't tell much about it yet, but it can turn out to be good.Otherwise this remake of X-COM is extemely close to original, even in its awful, really awful interface and slow uneventful combat system. Seriously: Time Units suck, especially when interface doesn't help you much to predict whether you have enough of them to complete your plan. Soldiers can't look behind a corner! They need to WALK behind a corner, then TURN - take a REACTION shot from an enemy - then maybe SHOOT, then WALK back. WTF. Cover system is very obscure. You cannot tell at first glance how much protection a cover offers and where you should place your soldier to use it effectively.New air combat is unnecessarily hardcore though it can have an appeal of its own. I struggled to fight against light scouts losing a fighter after a fighter, while autocombat offered me a 100% victory. It's not impossible to master, but well, it's hardcore. I warned you.Back to ground missions. Maps are extremely similar to each other. I found myself playing on the same map three times in a row, only differences being my starting place and UFO type!Xenonauts could be a much better game if they dared to shred some X-COM's obsolete features like TU's and interface micromanagement, but well, we have Firaxis XCOM with Long War mod for that.

												The game is buggy to all hell, and crashes constantly. Often not randomly. The keyboard binds do not save, and the interface is.. sticky and unpolished.Between losing support, the insane maintenance cost of multiple bases, staff, vehicles and production costs,the game difficulty curve never changes, and there is nothing you can do get ahead of it. Your troops never even get as good as the aliens troops, they are ALWAYS better, faster, more accurate.The aliens are ALL snipers (even the blind ones). They can shoot through glass, over obstacles and kill your troops in one hit easily on normal. Whereas my troops will sometimes miss a 3 yard shot with an 85% chance to hit, 4 times in a row. Or a heavy weapons soldier with a 25% chance to hit will miss all 10 bullets with his\her burst. Even with 8 Colonels for a fire team my troops cant help but shoot each other and miss 95% accurate shots way more often then they should. Additionally, shots are % based on your total time units, so your troops NEVER get to fire more shots per round, just move further.The reaction fire system makes it almost impossible to kill any aliens without getting shot yourself by the alien who's turn it ISN'T, because all the aliens seem to have AMAZING reaction times.2 Months into the game you need 4 bases and 20 fighter craft to deal with the entire worlds ufo problems and you will only have money 1\5 of that. Ufo invasions come in literal swarms so your ships sit and wait or are outnumbered 3 to 1.Scientists and engineers can NOT be moved from base to base, they must be fired and re-hired.(What year is it and how many turn based strategies have there been?)Tech options (research trees) are mundane and boring. Its the same old Balistic-Laser-Plasma, blah, blah, blah. Translation: more damage, better accuracy, different sound effects. Nothing interesting like a toxi-gun, or other biologic warfare. Even the bullets from the shotgun look like sniper and assault rifle bullets. Same with laser and plasma.All in all. The game is glitchy, my soldiers would rather shoot themselves, and it's a save\load-fest even on normal, the load times on the larger ship missions are un-godly long..oh and no quick save\load option.X-Com Apoc is STILL the best turn-based strategy. It was beyond stable, ran like water off a hydrophobic surface, good mission time vs geo-scape time balance (didn't spend 98% of your time in missions), well balanced difficulty curve (troops got dope), with interesting tech options.The soundtrack on Child of Light would get a better score than this game.

												I got this game while to hold me over until xcom 2 came out and was quite hyped for it after some of the gameplay I had seen. The logistical aspect of the game, managing your bases , building facilities and hiring more staff is awesome. and has even more scope then xcom eu. The abilitiy to build and field TANKS was one of big things I was looking forward to in this game and I was not disapointed.I never played any of the original xcom games so I found the combat a little hard to grasp, and it took me awhile to figure out how turn units work, but after I got past the learning curve it wasn't bad at all.The artwork is top notch and all the lore behind research projects is well worth the read.You're probablly wondering why I'm giving this a negative review after hearing how great I think the game is, but the last is also the most important.The game feels dead.......When I go on a mission and deploy my troops there's no life, A simple idle animation would suffice so people don't look like cardboard props standing in a field. There's no discernable ambiance and while this may not sound very important, it is. The game might actually be very entertaining but after a few minutes it simply gets to dry to play.I hold high hopes for the next game because with just a little more work this game could easily be better than the current xcom.

												Have you ever wanted to be bullied by extraterestial aliens that came from space to have sex with your fine booty? Well this is your game. You can command a massive army made of Russians, Amerifats, glorious Commonwealth soldiers and Jews and send them off to cause police brutality to the invaiding aliens with tear gas, night sticks and even elctroshock grenades. You can also build any form of jet to do drive by shootings of your enemies or bomb your neighbors house because they didn't pay your fee of being unraped by xenos scum. From landed ships and crashed ships from Bane to terror missions and even base assaults and defences this game has it all in the way of old xcom games but still miss the overly complicated overlay and a few rule sets.

Early Access Review
								I finally finished the game. I don't see myself going for another run because in the end the game became such a drag. Around the 100th hour i just wanted it to end and about 30 hours more it did.The game works. The majority of bugs have been ironed out and the turns pass quite a bit faster than they used to. Theres definitely enough content to warrant a playthrough but not much more.			"

												I played this one through just out of boredom. First I tried playing it on ironman, but soon noticed that the whole game is riddled with oneshot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t through walls and other cool stuff like that which you have zero control over in any way and absolutely no way to counter them, in any way. Your guys will constantly get oneshot, even in the best armor, out of the blue, or sometimes, through walls.I especially love the grenade mechanics in this game. You see that comforting animation of something flying and you're like: ""yay! grenades!"". Sadly, the reality is cold: they thought it's too much hassle to actually code grenades to have their own mechanics, like flying path which would allow them to fly OVER the obstacles. Instead, they fly in a straight line like bullets hitting every possible obstacle on the screen and in addition to that they have ridiculously low hit % and the scatter is random to the max. Of course this doesn't prevent the aliens from throwing grenades THROUGH EVERYTHING, including walls, and hitting with them 100%. More ofthen than not that results in the death of everyone in the blast radius, even with best armor and 100hp. Mass oneshots, yay. If you ever happen to hit with your own grenade, you can feel happy if it makes a scratch on the alien. Also you can't even blow up covers effectively with grenades thanks to the... ""interesting"" explosion mechanics they use. And in addition generally you need 2-4 grenades to destroy any envinroment block. So yeah, grenades, why are they in the game?Also your hit % with most weaponry is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly low unless you go into melee and the cover mechanics are iffy at best. If there's a pebble anywhere in the path between you and your enemy, your shot will lose hit %. And I mean literally a pebble. A pebble will lower your aim by 10% and anything fist sized will lower it by 25% and so on. And... I don't even want to get started about the % based action costs. Basically your virgin rookie who hasn't drawn first blood will shoot his/her gun as just as many times as your battle-hardened commander who's looked death and slaughter into eyes and laughed. Your highest rank soldier will move a few squares further and that's it. He'll still get oneshot anyways.The combat is extremely simplistic, exactly like it was over 20 years ago in the original X-COM games. That's all nice and cool, but if I want to play a game with 20 years old technology I'll play those games, which actually have functioning grenades as well in addition to some other cool stuff. Additionaly they have the great excuse of actually being over 20 years old, so you can forgive their flaws more easily. From the newer X-COM games I really missed the classes and how they affected the game play in various different ways. It added spices to the old mix, making missions different and changing your approach. Also another thing I missed was the ""trinket"" items of the newer games. Like S.C.O.P.E.S. and stuff. The lack of player usable psionics is also a con.But is there anything good in this game at all...? Well, I liked the base buildling and how you had to manage more than one base to save the Earth. Also the air combat mechanics, even though simple, were a nice thing. Both of these could've been improved on, massively. The base structures could've had more variation in different ways and so on. But still, it's an indie game and at least they tried. And why do you have storerooms in the game at all if they are basically not used? You store what? 2 items in those? Alien alloy and energy things. Why do you destoy the alien corpses after the missions? I'm sure there would be a market for alien skull decor for housing if you have no other use for the corpses. Also the rewards of doing missions are pretty lackluster, but in this game that's a good thing when you think about it...Apparently there's going to be Xenonauts 2 so we shall see if they manage to actually improve the mechanics. I hope so. This one had potential, but you can see through it's flaws after a very short time of playing.I can't really recommend this game unless you're suffering from massive boredom. If you want some turn-based alien action I'd recommend you to try The Long War mod for X-Com:Enemy Within.			"

												I waited on this game for close to what... a year now? At first I was unsure if it was worth the money, and people's complaints about LoS and other annoyances held me at bay even more. Today, finally, FINALLY a discount worth getting the game at. I love it more than the new X-Com. Not only do I already enjoy it's systems just a few hours in, but besides the stray trick-shotting alien, the game runs perfectly and feels fair. The time period is spot on, the music is spot on, and the atmosphere gets so tense that I have jumped twice playing so far. Top this with the time units, allowing you to pop out of cover and fire, the great LoS(the ability to face your soldiers and actual vision arcs)/cover (the abiltiy to crouch, and intervening objects actually having an effect on accuracy) systems and you have a tactical game that is better than most on the market. I've dumped copious amounts of money to my regret into games that are too slow or too shallow, where the atmpshere it too light for the game or the game too light for the atmosphere. Xenonauts does not stand in the ranks of those games. If you played the new X-Com, throw it away and come learn how to run an actual defense network. Buy it. I give you my word you wont regret it. The truth is out there.			"

												XENONAUTS FANBOIS BEWARE : THE FOLLOWING WILL BE A HARSH COMPARISON TO THE CLASSIC XCOM (1994 - 1995), DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOUR WELLBEING DEPENDS ON CONSTANT GLORIFICATION OF THIS GAME OR IF YOU GET UPSET EASILY : (scroll down if you want to read about reality, please)1) in parts buggy2) bad, miniscule research3) interesting aircraft-recovery, losing a craft costs nothing but WILL cost time (usually 72 hours)4) difficulty-progression is worse / more steep than in XCOM (yes, the real, classic ones) - basically you have 2 years  ... which is far from good and isnt any fun --- unlike XCOM in which the player has at least a decent amount of time before♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan5) available money seems adequate at first - but if you dont want to lose after 2 years you will need to invest EVERYTHING and fear every loss because that can (and will) end the game. Thats XCOM on high difficulty, in this game its medium. Thats sad. (i dont remember the exact difficulty-names, sorry)6) research doesnt make much sense - the results are well explained but its senseless to gain knowledge about ARMOR during PLASMA RIFLE reseach, for example - that should've been available after ""alien alloys"" .... and its only a small example7) air combat is a bit more fun than in XCOM - but its also a bit harder8) air-retreat has a big bug : the match ends only once the UFO (!) has left the screen, even if your fighter has already left9) ground combat is ... not bad, it basically looks like XCOM with high resolution but in that case i prefer a lower resolution - either polish the classic combat in ways which make it better or keep it like it is .... there is no in-between, everything else looks pretty cheap to be honest and thats exactly what this game is -- even the dying-animations (if one could call em that) are cheap and consist of .... one (?) single step - in XCOM it was at least 2-3 per alien.10) Music is good but the soundeffects are pretty bad - most sounds are missing or replaced by very bad ones11) It has no XCOM-like feeling, the ground combat does not instill fear, there is zero tense anywhere and  it looks like ... something boring.12) ground combat-view is not rotatable. Yes. One of the most important features in tactical, turn-based games is missing. XCOM had it. Because its necessary.13) the world map looks bad - even XCOM had a (much) better one, even in 3Dconclusion : its worse than the classics in some ways. The few additives make it worthwile for a few hours but thats it ... if you want a new (and ACTUAL) XCOM-follower this is not your game, its basically a bad version of what should've been released from the original XCOM-developers a few years after the last of the (original) series ... not bad but also not really good.

												Certainly an interesting experience, and certainly not the worst in terms of value-for-money, but unless you are interested in the old XCOM I found that the mechanics can get quite grating towards the end of my playthrough:There is a lot of UFOs, and thus crashsites to clear, and this doesn't exectly hide the fact that there is a VERY limited number of maps - about 8, so you can expect to have to clear EACH map about 30 times if you were to manually do every mission. A related issue is that the game doesn't handle multiple levels very well - e.g. so move a soldier from the first floor to the ground floor you need to press tab once, select the soldier, then press tab about four times to cycle back to the ground floor before issuing a move order. Enemies on higher elevation can hide in spots not visible from the ground, occasionally annoyingly prolonging combat.And sadly, there is not a huge amount of gear to choose from - e.g. you end up with two choices for armour (heavy armour limiting the user to machine guns, and light armour with a jetpack that makes the character FLY nearly every time you give him a move order and also makes checking corners redundant due to 360 degree vision), which ultimately contributed to me rushing towards the end; having everyone in the annoying jetpack armour was just too damn annoying.If this review had been for the first half of the game I'd have recommended it, but with the 2nd half I don't think I can recommend the game overall UNLESS you are already into what I assume old school XCOM was like; I, at least, won't be playing it without looking very hard at mods to fix the above.

												This is an amazing game by an indie developer, well worth purchasing if you enjoy strategy or xcom or even the new x-comPresuming you know the genre alreadyPro'sYou can build more than one baseYou can build bases anwhere you like(on land) and it matters where geographically, not just 'base in xxxx country' you can protect multiple counteries with a single well positioned baseYou can build individual buildings in your bases any way you like(it matters if/when a base is attacked)Nations care wether you protect their airspaceYou can recruit soldiers and make them ANY class you like and equip them in many different ways(ie, carry a sniper rifle and  a rocket launcher if you like, weight matters of course)You can send your fighters on patrol even if you don't have radar range in a spot (get lucky!) or respond to civilian reports just outside your radar coverageMULTIPLE DROPSHIPSManufacture gearScientists and Engineers require space to live/work Beautiful music and very nice art designThere is more than 1 ufo at a time, at times.ConsCrashed once in about 20 hours of play I wish I could customize my soldiers color to more easily differentiate them(ie, know without clicking/looking at what they are carrying)You will play more than you should. . . . . . .PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY!!!!!Add me if you have any questions :)			"

												I bought this game expecting a modern take on the classical XCOM formula. Instead I got a huge buggy mess.Ground combat is just too damn clunky in almost every aspect from taking cover to how field of vission works, how grenades are thrown, etc. Turns out trained armymen don't know how to shoot around corners...While I enjoy some of the added depth that Enemy Unknown/Within lacked, the gameplay itself is just subpar in almost every aspect except the air combat part which is better in Xenonauts.I really wanted to like Xenonauts but that is not happening. I suggest you keep away.			"

												UPDATED: With the release of version 1.51 I decided to give this game another go.Unfortunately after putting in enough time to get to the final mission I still have to give this game a thumbs down.  Much of the game has been improved, many bugs fixed but there's ultimately still some very weak or bad mechanics and a lack of balance to the game.The difficulty level even at Normal is still punishing of even the smallest of mistakes.  By the end game even with troops with almost all max'd stats using the best armor and weapons available it's not uncommon to be sniped at by monsters that are beyond view range and are very good shots, sometimes killing your soldiers in one hit or two hits.  This turns the game into a load/save fest because if you lose your well trained troops in late game it'll be very hard to train new troops with bad stats up to the level your previous troops were.There's still issues with visibility and firing angles that often don't make sense, such as cases where I'm 100% blocked from shooting an alien I can see but yet it can shoot at me.  Also missed shots are entirely too erratic, standing right behind your own tank your veteran soldiers can still fire off a shot so badly aimed it hits and severely damages your own tank.  Or trying to shoot an alien in a second story window and having the missed shot hit a stack of pallets 10 feet in front of my soldier at ground level.  I've never fired a real gun in my life but I'm confident I could get the bullet to go in the general direction of the window with minimal training.Morale also gets silly, my squad has been on dozens of missions, each member killing dozens of aliens, but still will find reason to panic or flee at times.Many UI elements are not well designed or missing information.  When you unlock new weapons that you can build in your workshop there's no tooltips in the workshop to provide details on what the stats of the weapons are.  So you end up having to blow money to build a single weapon to then look at its stats to understand if you want to bother making more.  Item weight is not listed in the tooltips either, you have to equip them and do the math to figure it out, not hard, but annoying.  It wasn't clear to me until late game that when intercepting an alien craft you can send multiple planes.  Hiring a soldier and putting them in a dropship requires going through 3 screens.It's odd that you can't build other base buildings until the command center is completed. This isn't apparent until you experience it firsthand.  So be careful - the second base you build is going to take 10 days longer than you think it will.  They should really let you plan out/execute a blueprint all at once for the entire base.  Take into account build times and existing structures automatically if you want.""Run in Windowed"" option only works if the resolution is less than your native desktop resolution.Other countries that you don't have coverage over seem to lose money faster than reasonable when playing at normal difficulty even after version 1.51.The entire interception portion of the game is entirely too tightly balanced and crucial to success.  I'm here for the TBS not the interception game.  Having said that, I can't stress the value in having a large air force and doing airstrikes on many of your alien crash sites.  You can't and will not want to raid them all.I ended up having to tweak the monetary values of several items in the game in order to loosen the difficulty up (on Normal) to something more reasonable to the point where the focus of the game was on the missions with your troops rather than trying to balance a checkbook.Don't get me wrong, the game isn't horrible.  However unless you're dying for a new TBS game (and I was) I'd recommend waiting till it's on sale before trying.  If you're a fan of the new XCom and are expecting more of the same look elsewhere.

												If you are an autismo dank memelord philosopher-warrior like myself, then this game will give you an insufferably persistent erection of the most dire intensity. This is simply one of the best strategy and tactical games I have played in years. You are leading a black ops organization that exists to defend the Earth from alien invasion, and it is multinational, receiving funding primarily from the USSR/USA but the rest of the world as well. You start at the beginning of an alien incursion into Earth, and you are charged with building base[s] from which to base interceptors, infantry strike teams and their helo transports, radar, SAM sites, research laboratories, workshops to build dank new memes for your infantry and pilots, medical centers, et cetera!The strategic side of the game occurs in the geoscape, where you make decisions regarding the administration and disposition/construction of your bases. You monitor world events - alien incursions will occur with the aim of terrorizing populations, and the more South Americans♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants, the less money they will allocate to fund your operations. You can increase your relations (and funding!) with regions by intercepting and destroying UFOs. By shooting down a UFO over land, you create a crash site, which you need to launch a raid on aliens and recover alien technology and resources. This is critical. The strategic side of this game is very engrossing.On the tactical and RPG side of the game, you scout, hire, and deploy infantry in a variety of roles, with a variety of equipment, on a variety of missions including raids/assaults and base defense. Your troops come from all over, with pertinent information (aside from their ability statistics) being age, nationality, prior unit, and combat experience.

Assaulting a crash site is always messy, and a genuine challenge.One point of contention - I'm a Marine, and as such it pisses me the ♥♥♥♥ off to see virtually 50% of troops in the game be females.

												I don't understand the positive reviews because this game is not very polished or playable. The level of polish is from a game I would have expected 20 years ago. It doesn't have the same playability as the original XCom and shouldn't be compared to it.1. The in-game help does a poor job. Why does it say I don't have enough hangar slots for a new fighter when I have a free hangar? This and a bunch of other questions send me to google searches 10 minutes into the game.2. Why is it when I buy new solders they don't show up in my ship list?3. Why it is when one research completes it doesn't automatically start a new research on my queue, instead of requiring me to manually assign scientists?4. It's extremely cumbersome to reserve action points. I have to click or make a hotkey to reserve a certain amount, but this doesn't account for kneeling or soldier rotation.5. Melee attacks don't work, clicking the button just uses action points and does nothing.6. How many action points do I need for grenades? No way to tell that doesn't take a lot of clicks.7. How does cover work?8. How does overwatch work?9. Things which should be simple take many clicks - healing myself, throwing grenades, assigning soldier gear.There is no in-game narrative. Unlike XCom which has animations and voice acting to flesh out the feel of what is going on, you are just dumped into a bunch of spreadsheets and left to figure things out.The only real positive to the game is the 2D art, which is generally well done.

												I'm someone who has played all the X-COMs when they first came out, including X-COM Interceptor and X-COM Apocalypse.  I enjoyed them all.  I really haven't been able to enjoy Xenonauts, though, despite  wanting to.I think it's because of the 1990's graphics and animations, and the timeline of the setting.  I have no idea why the developers chose 1979 as the time to set the alien invasion, but the fact that they did and actually made some of the aliens look like 1970's aliens (Caesans) makes the whole thing feel kind of cheesy.  I mean, the original X-COM felt more stylistically appealing than this groovy rendition.  So a blah rating from me.			"

												The game is, I suppose, ""fun"" if you're interested in nothing but a strait rehash of the original XCOM series. And by that I mean if you're a fan of fustration and like having your butt handed to you on a platter on a consistent basis. I played through, all the way, on 'normal' mode (which is actually easier than what it's supposed to be played on, which is veteran) and the sheer unfairness of it all was mind boggling.Grunts that would have something like a 17% chance to hit at point blank range, the absolute worst RNG ever (consistent misses, also at point blank range, with shotguns when you've got like a 90% chance of hitting). Aliens that can see across the screen when you *can't*, absolutely insane maintenance costs that basically mean that if you don't optimize your initial base you'll basically never be able to make another base. Which is a problem because you *need* at least 3 or 4 bases in total if only to get radar coverage of the whole world map. To say nothing of the extreme cost putting hangers and fighters in those locations.TLDR- Horribily unbalanced combat in favor of the aliens, horribly implemented and unbalanced economy. When it's literally impossible to make a second base because your funding is so low you can't even afford to *start construction* there is a problem. Especially since the odds are extremely good that once you hit that critical point where you aren't making enough money you'll basically stay there for the rest of the game.I recommend this game only for die hard purists of the original XCOM. In every other way however the newer XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within is a superior use of your money. That and if you're really a die hard purist of the original XCOM then you could, you know, just buy the original XCOM since it is also on Steam.			"

												I've played a number of X-Com games... and in fact X-Com Apocalypse is my favorite game of all time, and I really wanted to like this game.  The game artwork is sorta mediocre, but the gameplay graphics are more than adequate although not anywhere near the quality X-Com Enemy Unknown.  What is most important to me in this type of game is the gameplay, and this is where Xenonauts falls woefully short.  Let me give a couple of examples.I started the game on the default ""normal"" difficulty, chose my starting base, and proceded to ""fast forward"" towards the first enemy encounter... Seconds later, a target is spotted and I send both my aircraft out to intercept the bogey.  Once they get close to their prey, they violently circle around the target at dizzying speeds until eventually they run out of fuel and have to return to base... hmm... okay.. no problem.. I will just start over.  This happens again and again over the next 3 or 4 restarts (from scratch choosing a different start location each time).. Apparently they didn't play test this part, or apparently I was very unlucky about ship positioning.Okay... Finally I get a non-spin cycle encounter, and I heroically down the bogey with barely a scratch... Time to send in the troops !   My troop ship lands and my 8 ground agents are ready to kick some alien butt !   I deploy my troops from the landing craft in pairs, being sure to reserve some Time Units for a shot or two in case aliens are close.  From past experience, I also make sure to ""kneel"" and take advantage of cover whenever possible.  My last troops out of the ship are Joe & Bob... and I deploy them kneeling side by side behind a nearby fallen tree trunk and I End My Turn.  The hunt is on !  Seconds later during the Enemy Movement phase, I strike it rich !... My planning has paid off !   An unwary alien has appeared direectly in front of my two would-be heros, and Bob carefullly lines up a shot with his Sniper Rifle using his extra Time Units that he saved.... HEAD SHOT !... Not the Alien... but Joe crouching 90 degrees off to his right one square away  :(Twice I removed the game from my hard drive, and twice I reloaded it in hopes that it was a quirk experience... But these experiences happened each time.   I sincerely hope that the developers/programmers work to correct these problems, and I hope I have the opportunity once again to try to play this game, but as for now, it will be removed again, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.

												TLDR: Game is too repetitive, slow and has very bad UX, further exacerbating the slowness.I've completed Xenonauts on veteran today. And Xenonauts is NOT a good game. The user experience is horrible. ***Mild spoilers ahead***2 main points to illustrate, strategically and tactically:1)Strategically, this game pointlessly drags on for many, many hours more than necessary because the UFOs that contain necessary tech just simply DO NOT arrive until VERY LONG time into the game. Case in point: First Battleship for me? UFO-199... You have to go through like 100+ tactical mission drudgery just to advance the game... And you sort of HAVE TO play the tactical part because Airstrike doesn't give enough resources. Then, even when you have some Marauders (but not a lot yet), you still have to play each air combat out, and it's exactly the same, you patiently click and wait, click and wait, until you are tailing UFO for comfortable Cannon takedown to avoid taking damage... And you will have to play 10s of air battles, which gameplay you solved 10+ hours ago, just to farm enough money to afford 10+ Marauders so you can autoresolve.2)Tactically the game is also really bad. The maps are too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ large and Industrial map is the biggest nightmare of them all - you will have to advance at a REALLY SLOW pace, or else you will get killed. That is not difficulty, that is just boring. And all 90% of deaths I had was because I got so bored of advancing a few tiles a turn I just rush in with all TUs spent. Late game things get even more messed up - Once you got Sentinel Armor, you cannot simply order a soldier to move to a point, and then do it with the next one - The camera will FORCEFULLY center on a soldier who's flying MULTIPLE times and will break your control of someone in a Predator armor because your previous soldier is flying at a DIFFERENT ALTITUDE LEVEL... And thus you are forced to watch EACH of 12 soldiers SLOWLY move one by one to the target point. The same bull$hit happens on UFOs with multiple levels.I think the developers didn't play this game themselves. I do not know how they could subject anyone to this mindless boring repetitive piece of krap.What's the difference between old school UFOD and this?1)Turns resolve momentarily. In Xenonauts they take 5-15 seconds on I5-3570K. The simple AI logic doesn't warrant this amount of computation.2)The animation was instantaneous. Courtesy of DOSBox speedup, but still. In Xenonauts. you have to watch people fly for like 7-10 seconds each in Sentinel armor for NO good reason.3)The UFOD does not swarm you with pointless spam of UFOs. Maybe it should have, but you should NOT have to capture EACH of them in order to barely have enough money for anything. I've had 10 colonels by mission 30-35. Then what? Nothing - you still play 100 more combats with them, with barely any progress at all once TUs and Accuracy are maxed out.4)Game pace in UFOD is much better, you do not have to trudge through 50+ UFOs to advance to next tech level.5)With late game tech you can own small UFOs no problem. Not true in Xenonauts. Due to best armor in the game being unable to stop the very wild 50-150% damage fluctuation, you still have to be wary of a lucky burst from a simple Caesan.6)UFOD had Psi. Xenonauts? Only aliens do.Would I play this game again? Hell no. Too much time wasted NOT playing or making decisions, but watching unit animation, and waiting turns.			"

												DEVELOPER'S REVIEWHi. I'm the developer of this game, and I will provide an honest, accurate and totally fabricated review for XENONAUTS.First of all, we needed to find the most suitable engine for re-making X-COM. The choice was this browser game engine I found the other day. It was no longer supported, but hey---making another X-COM shouldn't be that hard, yes? So I picked it up.We ended up struggling five years to make this engine to fully address our needs. It still can't. I blame the engine. I could have asked somebody who understands game development, but I didn't. One would say I could Google it once, but I didn't do that either. Sorry that your game can not run properly. I know my apology makes it up for it, so don't thank me.While we were designing the game, we strictly followed the X-COM features. But we didn't implement random map generation, Psi-Combat, aliens being affected by morale, alien path finding, reasonable difficulty scaling, destruction, inventory management, and also any AI which is acceptable by the standards in 1994. But I think XENONAUTS is still VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY accurate and faithful to its roots.The reason why these features listed above didn't make it to the full game is, simply we're not that good at programming. Personally it took me a month to understand the necessity of loops. Our top programmer at the other hand, just figured out how to solve 8 Queens on a Board problem. Other programmers knew how to write code, but they don't know how to read code. I suspect it's because they don't write reusable and documented code, but that's just my insight. I might be wrong.On the visual side of things, we needed talented but cheap artists. It never occurred to me that these don't usually match, especially if it is marketed. So I picked up some people from DeviantArt. Overall, the game looks OK but character portraits really rule IMO.Then we had a painful period of designing the game elements. With all the lacking features that made X-COM great, we decided that the aliens should see the location of all the Xeno operatives. Also which direction they're facing so Xeno trapping the aliens is almost never possible. While we posted on forums that, random map generation and dynamic AI pathfinding is surely not possible, we were somehow incredibly skilled at keeping aliens out of Xenonaut FOV. There came the magic stroke: we made the alien FOV greater than the Human FOV. Because it makes sense and definitely not to force difficulty on players.As aliens seeing the location of human operatives are a settled and a realist fact, an inseperatable reality of extraterrestial combat at this point, we also decided to make aliens act as defensive as possible. We made the cover system work for aliens, only at times the game would feel like it. And the obstacle angles generally favor the aliens, because it's also the fight against the computer. It can process and evaluate millions of conditions in a second. In a second gentlemen, millions.In the end we finished with an X-COM remake, presented to you, made as faithful as possible. I look back at this point and I see, that I've made some mistakes but they are not as many as any game developer out there. The players on Steam are already used to unfinished, unplayable, badly programmed, unpolished, buggy, extremely slow at saving / loading and lacking games. In fact, there are already people out there who fixe our game by themselves. It'd be foolish to not use their efforts. So, here's XENONAUTS; an X-COM remake that doesn't dumb it down as Firaxis' X-COM reboot does. Have I told you that it helped us a lot that they chose to make a ""crappy X-COM reboot""? It really made up for our incompetence so we could trick you classic X-COM gamers to buy this game.Thank you, XENONAUTS Dev.P.S.: Mac and Linux ports don't work. Sorry about that.			"

												Be careful what you wish for. Xenonauts is a detailed re-invention of PC classic X-Com, which was difficult in the masochistic way gamers seem to love these days.Xenonauts also dispenses with tutorials about core game functions and mechanics. It's a complex game, and unforgiving of the slightest mistake. If that sounds appealing to you, dig in. Personally, I found it similar to those ""Tough Mudder"" ""fun"" runs. I get why some people enjoy it, but I think it's ridiculous.As a hardcore fan of the original X-com, and a fan of Firaxis' remake, I find Xenonauts tough to enjoy. Maybe I'm spoiled with ""fun"" gameplay, intuitive controls, and being able to play a game without reading a Wiki for hours first. But having a starting soldier equipped with ""default"" gear he lacked sufficient Time Units to fire, one of my jets shot down on the first UFO, and my first squad fully wiped on 3 starting playthroughs didn't make me say ""wow, this is great"". It made me want to do just about anything else.			"

												Pushed forward as a spiritual successor to the classic 1994 X-Com, it tries to mimic the classic game while pulling in the mechanics of Jagged Alliance, but somehow loses the fun aspects from either game.  The ground combat lacks punch or amusement, the world map is bizarre (Mercator projection with no adjustment for curvature) in the geoscape, research and manufacturing feels limp and while the air combat actually makes sense now (compared to the old X-com) and is quite tactical, it becomes a chore quickly.Overall it just seems to be missing the aspects that make it fun.

												I really wanted to enjoy this game.  But I didn't.It's hard to quantify exactly what sucked the fun out of the game for me, I think it's a combination of elements.Graphics:  awesome .. if it were the late 90s and the game were a direct sequel to UFO: Enemy Unknown.  But it isn't.  I just found the graphics - whether units, localities, base drawings .. to be very underwhelming.  I know they were aiming for ""retro charm"" possibly because they couldnt afford/achieve ""acceptable for modern gaming"".  (I do like some retro-charm games, like FTL .. but I guess I suffer the graphics because I enjoy the gameplay.Gameplay:  where to start .. ?   I found the AI to be pretty simple -- the action point system quite painful, especially managing large numbers of units -- the fog of war to be quite annoying (I dont mind fog of war in general, but in this game it's just an ugly mechanic and in many ways not intuitive .. like not seeing over a hedge) -- on a good note, the progression of units felt OK -- the strategic map and base building was OK but .. dunno, it didn't feel to me like a gripping financial sim, which was one of the appeals of the original.Research tree, all the incidental stuff - dunno .. just felt ""been there, bought the t-shirt, don't need to go back"".I had no particular expectation of the game .. which is usually a good thing because you're not set up for disappointment .. and yet somehow I came away disappointed anyway.Maybe it's just because the formula hasn't aged well.  I enjoyed the original games, played up to Xcom: Apocalypse (which I also enjoyed despite being outraged and culture shocked by the fact that they confined it to a city).  But yeah .. in my opinion Xenonauts is a pretty bland game .. maybe a 6/10 ..My advice is to kick the tyres and look at some videos before deciding to pick it up. "

												If this game is on sale, and you like tactical/strategy games, Xenonauts is a fairly good experience.In a decently imagined world lifted directly from the XCOM series, you can watch your apparently untrained trained soldiers fumble with their weapons, panic, fail to aim completely and die horribly at the hands of a wide variety of alien scum.If playing the game on any difficulty is too frustrating and arbitrary, you can just re-balance the game with a text editor of your choice.4/9, Would bang.

												Abysmal and painful to play.This really is a classic example of the boring retro for the sake of retro trend that is the equivalent of hipster music fans insisting that anything after a band's first demo is crap. The same people who obsess over this will be the same ones who whine about the brilliant Xcom enemy unknown game for being ""cinematic"". Such heresy, how dare modern technology actually make games fun to play and enhance the atmospherics and visuals while also giving it a gameplay system that actually works. The negative reviews here hit on some key issues, the combat is unbearable, illogical and random, crouch makes no sense, visibility is a mess as well, can be a few tiles away from an enemy and they'll just disappear from view, you can't use anything properly for cover or aim over or around anything, but hey, I guess realism and better gameplay don't matter, that's ""too cinematic"" and we must rigidly cling to the outdated systems of early 90s video games. Also even on easy the game is not so much hard as plain awkward as your soldiers can't shoot for s**t and half the time end up firing at each other instead, the interface in general is as awkward and inaccessible as the old games if not worse and unlike modern games that actually have these things called tutorials and learning curves it just expects you to figure all of this out at the start. The graphic style leaves a lot to be desired, whereas the likes of shadowrun, wasteland 2 and xcom have done a fantastic job of updating the visuals while remaining faithful to the classic and newly revived isometric format, Xenonauts has this silly cartoonish style that I really can't take to. Also the audio mix seems a bit off, can barely hear the ambient music, but the only settings in the game you can alter at all are controls....Just the whole combat system is so outdated and tedious to play, as soon as someone's wounded they can't do anything, does the game tell you what to do to heal them? Of course not, but I guess you can only know how to play this game if you grew up with 90s xcom games. I guess this is something for rigidly conservative gamers incapable of trying out anything made past 1995, but modern turn based games do the whole isometric sci fi tactics much, much better. Trying this overhyped disappointment just makes me more impatient for a follow-up to the Xcom Enemy Unknown and Enemy WIthin games.This modern trend of just shamelessly regurgitating retro games and outright refusing to take on board what games since then have achieved and moved forward with is just very tedious and pretentious. I am all for a degree of nostalgia and for reviving the classic isometric style but it's been shown in shadowrun and enemy unknown that you can take the best of both worlds without completely straying from the style of the classics. They're still old school at heart.			"

												So far, I'm rather disappointed.  While I was hoping for XCOM UFO Defense expanded and prefected, what I got was a rather dumbed-down version with some Facebook-esque artwork.  What's worse is that upon researching the game, I learned that there were several great features cut during early access and dumbed down, with developers being extremely hostile towards anyone who thought otherwise.Let's start off with the good: First of all, it's more XCOM.  No, not Firaxis' streamlined and modfiied reboot, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but the classic XCOM: UFO Defense and Terror from the Deep.  It's got a wider scope than the reboot, more micromanagement, and places equal emphasis on your planning as it did combat, unlike the more combat-focused reboot.  Regardless of your opinion on Firaxis' attempt to reboot the franchise (which I absolutely loved), this game is a completely different experience.Air Combat has been revamped, and feels like a game mechanic rather than a short prayer to the AI Director that has screwed you over so many times in your Warframe loot tables and L4D2 sessions.  It's one of the few changes I genuinely enjoyed, a fully realized version of the air combat in which you operate your ships in real-time and attempt to outmaneuver the alien contact.Variety of weapons.  XCOM classic had launchers, Assault Rifles, and pistols, Xenonauts added Snipers, LMGs, and Shotguns.New feature: Airstrikes.  They cost $15,000 and you miss out on loot, but if you simply don't have the resources to respond, you may have to take the loss to control damage.  It's a great addition, and one of the ways this game's best points is interception.  Now, let's go ahead and address the neutrals.External launcher.  I count this as a negative, but it's simply something I really can't take too harshly.Civilians are almost ALWAYS present.  I have mixed opinions on this, as while it gives the missions a bit more tension, it turns civilians into a regular instance of combat.  In XCOM, The announcement of a terror mission genuinely scared you, as it put your entire monthly rating on the line.  It threw off your usual strategies, and it forced you to take risks you would have never done before... now, civilians are just a ""oh well, let's go through plan D.""You're no longer protecting a planet, you're looking at a map.  Whatever, I think I'm done nitpicking for now.As much as I love some of the changes present, the rest of the game completely kills the praise I could have had for the game.  Well, let's get the pitchfork and burn this thing down:Artstyle.  It's cell-shaded and looks like it belongs in a Facebook game.  XCOM UFO Defense can pass as pixel art, and its visuals have aged fairly well.  This game already looks dated and distgusting.As I said, the mechanics are horribly dumbed down from XCOM UFO Defense, and combat isn't nearly as interesting.Somehow, they managed to make the XCOM UI block even more convoluted and unorganized.  I didn't even think it was possible, but despite the fact that XCOM was meant for resolutions ranging from 200p to 480p, it's amazing that with all the extra screenspace Xenonauts managed to do an even worse job of organizing the UI.If this were its own game, I would be willing to overlook the flaws and recommend it anyway.  However, it isn't an independent game, it's just an XCOM clone without the same kind of flair that the classic holds.  For $15 less, you can get the original and with the OpenXCom mod, it stomps all over Xenonauts.  If you really want a streamlined XCOM experience, you should just buy XCOM Enemy Unknown Complete when it goes on sale for $10, as it does often, then enable 'aiming angles' to make the RNG elements more predictable and balanced.  I'll still give this game another chance, but I'm not very optimistic.			"

It looks like it has all the pieces but then delivers a rather boring experience with no clear direction for both novice and experienced users. The gameplay on missions seems to have got all the love and the overview was just tacked on. I'm very disappointed ...			"

												Direct ripoff of the UFO series, which would offer a lot of quality time is implemented in a nice and clear manner. However, not only bugs like an occasional bullet through wall mar this incarnation of UFO, but the gameplay is basically broken. You'll end up with a boring series of save / make a move / see if it turns out well in the enemy turn / load. Save / Load. Save / Load.... which makes a boring play. The reason to save so often is that you can ill afford losing soldiers, whose abilities will get better with time. Also if you're new to the game you have no way of knowing which research does what exactly and base management is a silly drag with limitted space. What finally killed the game for me was the Predator armour. Going into action with two heavy armour suits had shown that they're a bit better than Wolf, but they'll easily get penetrated by the aliens. Anoter note is that aliens are not much worse than your squad, so statistically your chances of making it through 100 fights with your people intact are zero unless you save and load and load and load ...I've had more fun at work than playing this game.

												After enjoying XCOM Enemy Unknown (XEU) and Within, I decided to give it  a  try.  I started the game and had no clue what to do. Had to go back and read stuff. OK, lot of common elements to XEU but with a very clunky interface. Fine. So this game has an strategic level more complex than XEU. Many of the mechanics are similar to  XEU like constructing the base by expanding locations and selecting what to build. Combat is also similar turn based and using cover, changing weapons, etc. But I just have no fun with this game. Here is what I dislike. The combat in XEU is implemented much better. For example,  in XEU line of sight works is carefully implemented. In Xeno it seems they use a random factor to simulate it and it doesn't work well. For me combat was the most fun part of XEU and it is the worst part of Xeno. Xeno relies low hit rate to simulate difficulty. Chance is not a replacement for implementing strong combat elements like line of sight. XEU adds chance on top of strong combat elements, that is fun. Xeno adds chance as a replacement to implement strong game elements, that is not fun. I will stop purchasing games with low production values like Xeno. This seems implemented for the 1980's before dedicated graphic cards were implemented.			"

												Well I was a fan of the original X-COM (since 1994) and have (I think) played all of the X-COM-likes and X-COM clones to date.  Some have been interesting, most have been fairly bad but Xenonauts is special.You could put it this way, of all the X-COM clones over the last 20 years, Xenonauts is the most faithful.  In a way it is aiming to be the ""ideal"" version of X-COM, like it want's to be more X-COM-ey than X-COM somehow.  It does not attempt to introduce new core mechanics, blasphemy!  No wacky moves into mixed real-time mode and definitely no newfangled 3d!  It's like the dev sat down and said something like ""This game is going to be EXACTLY like X-COM exept where it is better!  Because, I don't like things that are different!"".Unfortunately the result is inferior to X-COM in every possible way.  And, it comes off as being devoid of any creative inspiration.  It looks like the Chinese, knock-off t-shirt of X-COM games.Since Xenonaut's only selling point would be the graphics, to review it you have to talk about that.  The graphics in Xenonauts are a slight improvement over the 1994 X-COM game.   But, they're embarrassingly crude by today's standards.  Xenonauts released shortly after games like X-COM Enemy Unknown and The Banner Saga which have set consumer expectations for this sort of game fairly high.An effort has been made to give the Xenonaut sprites smooth (rotoscoping?) animation.  Despite this welcome improvement the visual style is... well... bland, I suppose... insipid, maybe?  This whole game honestly made me wonder why this developer bothered to publish this product.  But, I think it might have had something to do with cashing-in on X-COM's recent popularity, in what essentially amounts to stealing IP.Anyway, that aside, Xenonauts is playable but don't get your hopes up for a ""dream come true"" X-COM update / remake.  It borrows freely from other, better games but gives nothing back to the genre.  It would comfortably make the grade as a marketable product for steam but beyond that it is only memorable for its extreme lack of creativity.It's very, very strange to see this sort of game come from indie developers.  It's a postcard from a topsy turvy world where indie devs cannot innovate and try to compete based on graphics.			"

												Aliens dont follow the rules of the game. It can say 100% blocked line of fire for you, but on the aliens turn they stay in the exact same position and kill your men. You can stay right behind a tall one square obsticle and it will say 100% blocked line of fire for you, in spite of the manual saying otherwise, and still the aliens can kill you behind that obsticle.Sometimes the ""cover"" system works, meaning you can stay behind a corner of a wall and shoot around it at a spotted alien by another unit. But other times you cant.UFO doors that you open on your turn stay open when its the aliens turn and they fire at you, and then closes when its your turn. If the doors are opened by the aliens on their turn, they close just the same on your turn. Spoiler: Blow the fricking door open.Losing soldiers to faulty game mechanics is not the way I want to be beaten by the AI!Downed UFOs are all the same. They never have holes blown in their sides that can use to enter the craft, you allways have to use the front door.Combat maps are decent. They are made of several smaller chunks, smaller than other X-com clones I've played, making the maps seemingly more varied. I've come across the same chunks very often, so there arent alot of them - yet. Maybe a modding community can rectify that.If you compare it to the original, which they clearly want (they even called their game X-COM one place in the manual) they have less stats than it. Xenopedia lacks info. You need to visit the soldier equipment screen to find the stats of the different weapons, and then only in a hard to activate mouseover popup. Cudos to the role system they have for the soldiers, making it very easy to switch equipment on soldiers. Is the game bad - No. Is it better than all the other clones out there - No, not really. Developers did their best. Its just so fricking unfortunate that they did the same misstakes as others did. ""Fully destructive terrain!"" - yea, only if you try to blow up the parts that they want you to blow up. Too bad. Its just another clone that doesnt meassure up as a successor. Disclaimer: This wall of text is without spelling errors and faulty grammar. If you see any - then the gnomes did it.			"

												I have been in the beta for this for an age and have tried really hard to like the game.However it fights back just too hard.  Window mode does not work, the game still crashes regularly and performs poorly despite a very decent spec PC.  Even though the game is now released, It still feels very beta and riddled with bugs and design faults.  It's a shame, the concept has been done before and done very well.  A carbon copy of previous Xcom games with better graphics would be so well received, but even with this game being released in 2014 the graphics are very poor.  I'll keep coming back every couple of months but Xenonauts needs significant work to become a finished product.			"

												I REALLY wanted to like this game and was excited that the team put together a turn based tactical game. Something that has been sorely missing for a while, but this game is just tedious.  Aliens shoot you from way beyond your vision and through corners/walls that show as 100% obstruction.  Enemies literally can be standing behind you without your knowledge as the Line of Site is absolutely wonky.  My 'elite' team sent out to save the world usually misses the braod side of any barn, while aliens with horrible vision seem like well trained snipers shooting around corners and despite 2-3 points of cover.  The best hit chances for my guys usually tap out at 30%. I suppose I should have simply bought a baseball game so those averages would be quality.Despite my best intentions, I just cannot give this game a positive review.  There are hints of a great game here and there but the tedious pieces need to be addressed.			"

So I decided to redeem the key to write a review.I'm sure the developers had good intentions. But this game is hot garbage. There's no reason to make a game purposely using horrible design, simply to make the barrier of entry too difficult, for old times sake.We use to read manuals and draw maps on graph paper and all that. We've evolved game design to involve a tutorial which welcomes a player. Even Civ, which has more complex ideas I think, has a tutorial complemented with a full in game manual which is easy to access and use.Hopefully we don't get a Xenonauts 2.			"

They would have equal accuracy, moral, and team work skills (i.e. not shooting your own guys in the back of the head when in formation). So why would they be better? Because they would be smaller targets when the aliens snipe then from across the map. Hell, maybe then your squads might actually survive a mission.			"

												Generally a good remake of original UFO: Enemy unknown in year 1994. Would want to give the game ""recommend"". However, the unrealistic setting in regarding to the financing, world political, world economy setting (by comparing to another xcom title - x -com : Enemy unknown) and the excessive punishment setting which prevent me to enjoy the game. 1. The organisation is poorly financed by the world and expectation is unreasonably high. Easily get financial punishment without a proper reason. Unable to expand due to financial problem.2. Reward setting is poor. Success in high risk mission do not end up with equivalent high reward. (Destorying an alien base do not get apprasal from the local government)3. Financing setting is poor. Limited option to get additional financing. Reselling price of advance equipment is unreasonably low just like the alien technology is commonly available to the world4. With such high end technology and elite soliders on hand, the organisation can simply choose to walk away and get financial from other source (selling alien technology, equipment in black market, team with the most rich in the world) and deal with the alien threat on its own (just like some other sci-fi fiction). Therefore, the excessive punishment setting in the game is not enjoyable. Beside, if the government choose to kill itself, who care. The end of the government does not mean the end of the world, so long the organisation continue to exist. Sadlessly our real world actually telling you this in these recent years.Anyway, the main point is, as a simulator, it would not be harmful if the game include the original rule set, improved rule setting and custom rule set for player to suit their style.

												This game is XCOM. It ***is*** XCOM. If you own any of the XCOM games, save your money and play them instead.Don't get me wrong: there's nothing wrong with it. It's just that it's so much like XCOM that I'm surprised it's allowed to exist. There's nothing new about it except for a graphics update, and if you've played any of the latest console versions of XCOM, even that's not there. So, why am I surprised it's allowed to exist? It's just a photocopy of the XCOM. To me, this game borders on trademark/copyright infringment. It's like me opening a McDonald's restaurant and making just one change: calling the restaurant McDanold's.I've read other reviews where people have written, ""This is XCOM as is was meant to be,"" or ""This is XCOM perfected."" Really? Well, I guess it was perfect before, then, because as I wrote, there's not much new about it. There are some changes: it takes place during the Cold-War, you can control your interceptor when fighting UFOS (think Zaxxon or Defender), and I guess sometimes your interceptor faces multiple enemies. However, these things are all superficial changes.Now, I have to say that I've only played the game for around three hours, so maybe there's something new that pops up at five hours, but I highly doubt it. I also have to say that I really didn't look into what this game offered before I bought it, so my feeling of getting ripped off is my own fault. But please listen to me: if you're looking for a game that might be like XCOM but better, this isn't it. This is just XCOM: Enemy Unknown. If you already own that or another XCOM game and you like it, play that when you're hungry for a fix. Don't buy this one. "

												Oh alright. I've finally found myself reviewing this game. There's a lot of thoughts slewing around in my head about this game. And I've finally come to a conclusion. In it's core concept it's a literal sucessor to UFO defense. For, at the time of this post, 5 times the price of the original  X-COM UFO Defense on steam. The guns are pretty unbalanced, generic and boring, the game feels odd, it doesn't feel like an advancement from the original. There are currently a lot of problems with this game. And I could go on and on about them. Most of them have to do with the gameplay. (However I should note the modder community is currently doing a lot for the game, making a lot of new weapons and whatnot to be put into the game.) There's a difference between 'Difficult but fair' and 'Difficult and stressful'. The developers have yet to figure out how to do the first one. Until the game is patched up a lot and a lot of the game hopefully fixed, I don't recommend this game to anyone. It's not so much that it's bad, but you almost might as well get the original game unless you're willing to spend $20 more for updated graphics and unbalanced gameplay.			"

""spiritual successor"" the term some are using, which reminds me the successors of Alexander the great, who conqueredq them? the spiritual successor one? bought this game when its still on early access, knew its a 2D old-school game, thought a game with poor graphic might have a great gameplay, didnt keep playing the early access vision becasuse of the bugs, and now i stop playing it because its just like that early access vision without those bugs to me, which is great, and realy bad as welland for the developer of this game, if anyone of you happens to see this review: people play this kind of game not because their laptop o pc are realy bad, nor they were cinematic effects hater, they play it because they have a lot of imagination and they like your ideal. plz dont ruin it if the financial condition is allowed.

It is very much like old school turn based strategy games, but also lacks modern game mechanics and improvements of newer turn based strategy games. The GUI is awful. It is poorly laid out. It isn't even remotely intuitive. Theres no cover mechanic. In fact it seems like shooting from cover makes your shots inaccurate. Sometimes your shot will hit the waist high wall in front of you. The complex gameplay is good. The game does have a lot of depth to it, but it is just poorly made. Its an indie title so I'll allow for the poor graphics, but it is not worth $25.1 / 10 would not recommend. DO NOT BUY.			"

												aand once again an attempt to do the XCOM of the new decade... and like the firaxis attempt, a miss.Tactical combat is ruined by cover system implemented over horrible map design.geoscape interface suffers from illogical command order (launch interceptors-select target-select planes, WHAT?)and apparently hotrigging an alien plasma rifle with a tactical handle plus trigger wire system is too high-tech so you research plasma rifles to... be able to sell them, or something.shame, really. Nonetheless after 20 years and more than 10 different sequels/spinoffs/copies if you wonder between buying this one, the 2012 firaxis ""xcom"" or the original do yourself a favor and buy original enemy unknonwn, terror from the deep and XCOM Apocalypse and play them on dosbox.

												If you did not play classic X-Com, stay away! This game is rife with dated choices and overly complex mechanics. Lots of awesome ideas ruined by a strict adherence to emulation of a decades old game. Combat is a snooze fest and air combat is complex for the sake of complexity. However, the fluff of the world is fantastic and I really enjoyed unlocking new technologies  just to read the descriptions. I would have loved to spend more time with the game, but the very long and tedious battles just wore me out.			"

												Xenonauts suffers from what many other games of this type suffer from, and that is ""click to roll dice.  input not required further.  listed results not guaranteed, unless it disadvantages player"".  This is probably the best game in this genre in many years, far surpassing the Xcom remakes, but is still more of a dice simulator than a game.  Actual gameplay does exist in Xenonauts, but its built in such a way that every decision is a pass/fail state.  IE, build your starting base in the wrong place, fail after an hour or two.  Build in the right place, survive for a couple hours.  Research the right techs and build the right corresponding devices, extend playtime 30 minutes to an hour.  Build anything else, end gameplay with failstate.  This will continue until the game over screen or the campaign victory screen.  Its a lot like hardcore 2d platformers in that its all about memorizing the right steps to take at the right times.  The most painful aspect to this is that you can easily survive awhile with the wrong decision, which gives you a false sense of progress, only to run into a brick wall that jolts you with ""hmmm so choosing X tech over Y tech an hour ago would have trivialized this new threat/mechanic.""  That is all there is to this game. Positioning of your soldiers in ground combat is nearly exactly the same.  There are 2 or 3 tactics that are nearly guaranteed to win you battles, and about a million tactics that literally wipe out your entire squad/fleet/base in a single round and end your campaign, and most succesful tactics involve exploiting some factor of the design.  Save scumming is easy in this game but really isnt that useful unless you want to avoid the dozens of hours required to get to the next pass/fail state and figure out the required move(hint: save scum for awhile to figure it out, then play a perfect campaign at whatever difficulty you want.  then uninstall. otherwise your just going to end up disapointed with the time you spent running the campaign to figure out the states). Something about the artwork and written lore however, really give this game VASTLY more atmosphere and character than the high budget cutscene and voice acting laden sexed up Xcom remakes.  That is both a compliment to Xenonauts and a slash on the Xcoms, but the fact remains there is almost nothing redeeming about this style of game. Getting attached to your soldiers is something much talked about, but neither Xcom nor xenonauts really have any personality in the characters and thus losing them is really only troubling due to losing a unit that has higher on screen dice rolls that ultimately are utterly meaningless given the inherent hit/death gameplay.  Much has also been made about the difficulty and Ironman modes, and to that i refer you to the wall of text i just wrote.If you are into it though, then Xenonauts is the best game you can buy in this genre on the market currently in my opinion.  It at least feels the most like a game and seems to be from developers that are genuinely interested in fake gameplay and interesting universes.			"

												This game has two levels: the strategic geoscape, and the tactical maps.The strategic aspect of this game is spot on.  Building facilities and managing your budget are key aspects to this game.  And the most enjoyable.That being said, the tactical part of this game sucks.  It is ENTIRELY based on a poorly designed random number generator (RNG.)  The RNG determines if shots will hit or not.  Your shots frequently miss (and your soilders are ex- SPECOPs by the way,)  while shots from the aliens will pass through several solid objects, including shields and other soilders (without injuring them) and fatally strike a soilder you were retreating.  Shots will frequently miss even at point blank ranges with all weapons, especially with shotguns and sniper rifles (I mean, really, shove the gun down the xeno's throat and pull the f---ing trigger.)  Your troops seem to have failed basic training (read: boot camp.)  They will FREQUENTLY panic without even being shot at.  They will throw down their weapons and run (I once had a soilder run INTO a UFO.  (What the f--- made you think of that idea dumba$$?)  You can not sling a soilder's weapon, throw a grenade, and unsling the weapon (so its back in your soilder's hands) during the same turn.  Needless to say, this make a panic smoke grenade impossible.  It seems that some doors are incapable of being closed (really, you're in the military and you can't close certain doors?)  It seems your soilders are incapable of melee combat without a certain weapon (a stun batton.)  (So, let me get this straight, you DON't know how to slam the butt of your rifle into a xeno's face?)  I've also had issues with soilders throwing grenades at thier feet.  (I'm not even going to say anything about that.)  Finnaly, the alien's psionic abilities are completly imbalanced.  Theroretically, they are capable of mind controling a soilder they can't even see while he is still on the dropship (and possibly dropping a C4 charge with zero turns on the timer.)  Not good at all when a core mechanic of the game is permadeath.(My English teacher would be saying to start a new paragraph here, so...) Then there are bugs.  Aliens seem to be capable of seeing through walls (then running up to your assult trooper holding a shot gun and blow his (your soilder's) brains out.  Meanwhile, your three other soilders covering that door don't do a damn thing.  I've had issues with blank screens and freezing as well (and this is a very resource unintensive game runing on a gaming PC.)  I've had soilders get shot, survive, and then drop dead as soon as my turn begins.  Finnaly, in the year 2014, this game uses a launcher.  A launcher that will not launch itself with certain background programs running (i.e. firewall and anti-virus.)			"

												Unlike some of the other reviewers I have no nostalgic tendencies towards games of this sort, I'm just a new user coming to it fresh. I found the graphics clunky and then spent an hour trying to work out how to kill some aliens at a crash site, with my soldiers shooting each other, before giving up. The rest of my steam playtime was idling for the trading cards.Maybe I should have spent more time on it before writing a review but the bottom line is that I just couldn't be bothered. A game has to appeal to new users as well as experienced ones, and this fails miserably. I'm afraid I can't recommend this as I've been spoiled by the far superior turn-based strategy game, Frozen Synapse.			"

								Interesting concept. On the plus side this game does offer gameplay reminiscent of the original XCom series. The abilty to research alien technology and then reverse engineer to enhance your team of elite soliders as they battle aliens in a variety of tuen based senarios is still there. Also there is the need to manage the logistics surrounding managing your resources including contsructing new equipment and costs associated with expanding  your bases facilitites. What is different is the pace of gameplay. Even on easy setting this game is very difficult, so much so that you find yourself saving and reloading again and again. The result is slowed gameplay that often feels like a real slog whereas the original titles were challenging but well paced. Other annoyances include the constant bugs that plague each release. All of my games work seamlessly with the expcetion of this title which crashes again and again. I accept this is a beta but this game is well into its software development life cycle so I'm dismayed to see so many problems still cropping up this late in the piece (the designers state they want to release this game in its completed form early this year). With the exception of die hard fanboys I can not see this title have much appeal to mainstream gamers like myself. Good effort but still not enough to dethrone the original Xcom titles.			"

								Still too buggy.   Lost my entire roster of soldiers when I reloaded my save from the previous night.It is a fairly faithful re-creation of X-COM, except for the cold-war skin they've wrapped it in, but I'm reluctantly forced to admit that Time Units are a fairly bland and overly complicated mechanic that ultimately slows down the game flow.  Games have been dumbed down quite a bit since 1994, but in some ways they have evolved as well.  What Xenonauts tries to do, it does well, but better ways to do it have been thought up since then.XCOM EU used the D&D4e rules to great effect on ground missions, and it was much less headache inducing.

								I was tricked into buying this game a week before the X-COM came out in the market.The developers had that as a ""release date"" initially on desur a. The game kept crashing at that stage and I couldnt get my money back so I remained silent and waited for the game to finally release for real.Now, that much time later, it's still called an ""early access game"" while the X-COM has already released expansions.This game could have been a good one if it was released 5-10 years ago, but in its current state and horrible graphics (the aerial battles are just ridiculous, atari had better graphics... Honestly).In any case- you don't play a game just for graphics- so lets hope battles are a bit balanced or something. They aren't. The easy mode doesn't feel easy to me and I have finished XCOM in difficult setting. Targeting around corners needs reworking too.If you have money to burn buy this game, you'll get bored though. Oh, also every couple new releases your last save won't be working.			"

When you actually find the aliens you have to attack them with your strike team but that can prove difficult when you solider is 2 feet away and only has a 35 pecent chance to hit so then if you miss the alien can shoot you and almost every time it hits and does 20 to 50 damage. please if you want to have a fun good time dont play this game.  it is definetly not worth the 25 buck for			"

								A poor remake with arcade realism. The developer himself admits to watering down the game. They've based the entire game economy on the air war, and, at the same time - made the air war far far too easy. Buy this only at a deep Steam sale discount. Probably in the $9.99 range, but at full price it just isn't worth it.If more dissappointing is the fact that your fighters can NEVER be killed. If they get shot down they magically ""crash land"", only to be completely rebuilt FOR FREE in a short 72 hours. Also, pilots never get injured and you get a free one of those aswell.The ground game is half decent, but air combat is candy land that one cannot simply dismiss it. It ruins immersion and any sense that you were playing a panetary defence simulation.Avoid.This is NOT the X-Com you so fondly remember.			"

It is more close to the old X-COM system giving you a lot of choice as to what goes down, you can have a large amount of deployable troops and generally the combat seems to be more ""tangible"" than X-COM: Unknown.Problem is it has a lot of problems, I told myself I wouldn't play it again until it's release so thus, fuss and ergo...Here we are.I'm scoring it now because I'm going to gamble the team vanish to dust before it's released.2 out of 5 chiliwigs.

Well, I still don't understand how parameters grow. And I can't assign attribute points because I have no one. But... This is exactly how Firaxis game works! Bullet weapon, laser, plasma, grenades, one of each sort. No variety, no advanced param. Just like in Firaxis XCOM. No generated maps (and number of maps, actually, very very deficient).So, this is parody of new XCOM with poor graphics and a lot of bugs.			"

								At the time of this review, the game was still in development and thus there were some glitches, bugs and balance issues.With that in mind, I still recommend this game as a somewhat successful x-com copy. Graphics arent the best, but I have to admit that old school graphics scare me more than fully detailed 3d and shiny aliens in newer games from bigger studios. the pace is quite slow and you have to ponder every move, slowly get your team into position for every corner (a thing about tactical turn based games) Difficulty wise, Xenonauts is a bit tough on beginners, however if you are reading this, that means you are after some depth and challenge in a game, anyway. For x-com veterans it should be a walk in the park (while getting killed many times by an unseen alien and reloading every now and then)Although targeted to a limited market, this game can only get better with time as developers work on it.

								Enjoying this game alot, its simple but addictive, much like the original x-com...some small features discarded and streamlined from that original but nothing to cry over. Overall makes for a much needed non-cartoony/consolized, pseudo real time (like the recent xcom and ufo series) spiritual successor to the original series.			"

												I have owned this game for awhile back when it was an early access title, back before the official XCOM reboot released. At the time I recommended not purchasing the game due to its significant list of missing features, bugs, and poor gameplay. My review of course got condemed, but I'm a true believer in reviewing a game on how it is *now* and not what it *might* become in the future.Over a year later, here we are at the official release.Now that the game is officially finished and released I am re-doing my review to reflect on how the game is in the current state.Xenonauts takes the conecpt and gameplay that many of us fell in love with long ago with the DOS game X-Com: UFO Defense and brings that into the modern world. It isn't a direct copy however. The aliens are different, their are different weapons, different technologies, different aircraft. It takes the best of the original game, and combines it with some of the best modifications to that game. As icing on the cake, it also incorporates some of the features the XCOM reboot by Firaxis had.It keeps the isometric 2D view from the original game, but with more modern graphics. Large squad sizes are present (your first aircraft can have 8). Base defense is present. You are allowed, and required, to have multiple bases. Combat remains turn-based, and time units are very much present. That convers just about all of the complaints series fans had with the XCOM Enemy Unknown reboot.New is a more indepth aircraft interception mini-game (that's optional, you can auto-resolve if you wish). Unlike most games with an auto-resolve feature, this one doesn't screw you over with excessive losses/damage if you use it.For anyone who was a fan of the original XCOM: UFO Defense game, or new people who don't want to deal with a DOS Box game I reccomend they check out this game and give it a shot. The initial difficulty spike is quite large, but after a few games you can learn what works for you and really start to dig in.			"

												I've been playing and modding Xenonauts for a year, now.  Steam tells me I've played ~200 hours and I could easily double that with the modding and mapping I've done.Since I'd played it so much, I wanted to see how it compared to the original X-Com: UFO Defense.  So, a few months ago, I loaded it up and started a game.  Half an hour in, half way through a ground mission, I quit.  For possibly the final time, I quit one of my most favourite games of all time; a game I've played on and off since I was 8 years old.X-Com is dead; long live Xenonauts!			"

												This is an extremely faithful remake of UFO: Enemy Unknown, even down to the original title's shortcomings. One of those shortcomings is quite a dated and complicated interface which feels lacking in many areas even compared to the original 1994 game. Xenonauts also doesn't bother explaining much about itself, so prepare for a high learning treshold, especially if you haven't played the classic original.But it makes up for it with some lovely (albeit tiny) graphics and atmosphere, and of course, the original tactical battles on random maps with roaming aliens that the Firaxis X-COM remake got completely wrong (although the cover system was a nice improvement that this game could have used). It's interesting to note that both X-COM and Xenonauts feel like they have line of sight issues compared to the original UFO, so prepare for some frustrating moments, in addition to those ""normal"" frustrating UFO moments! :)			"

								Revist/remake of the old school Microprose UFO: Enemy Unknown game. Its very similar to the original with a lot of the content removed(multi-format release) from the latest XCOM game returning .This game has improved strategy in the global setting over Xcom, with you needing to way up more options like; do I build another base to incease radar & aircraft range or add labs & scientists to get better equipment. Time is not on your side, funding dissapears very quickly on hard settings, especially due to unmonitored alien activity.The visuals do a decent job as does the AI (on normal & above). The maps are reasonably varied, yet do repeat slightly more than i'd like. They're about the right size & unlike the original I havent found myself hunting the map for the last camping in a loft alien for 30 mins. Theres also a nice addition in the form of being able to airstrike downed UFO's rather than sending a team in. Overall I've throughly enjoyed this so far and am happy to recommend it, if you havent played the original this is well worth your money. Do bare in mind though that the game is very unforgiving, especailly on the more challenging modes. "

								Most games find it difficult to provide a challenge, and make it feel fair, most end up having situations in which your character or characters are killed, and you feel cheated at tge way it happened, it normally feels like a cheap shot.Not in Xenonauts though.If a soldier is killed, you don´t feel like the game pulled a♥♥♥♥♥♥move, no, you know it was your fault, that you ♥♥♥♥ed up, and that you ♥♥♥♥ed up hard.Even then, losing soldiers is part of the game, the game clearly tells us that for all your preparations and tactics, you are still going to lose men and women to a much superior foe, and even if you start closing the gap, that it will keep happening, and happening, and there´s not much that you can do about it.But, that´s the alure of Xenonauts, a game that manages to strike a balance between challenge and fun.So, in short, this is a well recommended game.

								Xenonauts is a wonderful clone of the original XCOM - UFO DEFENSE and is in many ways a better experience. Xenonauts is more intuitive and pretty than its predecesor as well as creating the same feeling that you are juggling 9001 balls at once, and are constantly a few poor choices away from total collapse. All in all, the game is a great experience.Although I have not completed the game, just scratched the surface really (I've played three months in-game), I can say for certain that all of the difficulty of the original game is present. Every desicion is vital and it is imperative to really consider the best course of action at all times. If you don't, well, let's say there have been more than a few missions which resulted in complete annihilation of my squad, a terrible loss.The game is also much more faithful to the original than XCOM - ENEMY UNKNOWN, bringing back TU's, much larger squads, and a more complicated geoscape portion of the game. In many respects, though, it improves on the original. The OP Blaster bomb has been removed, the graphics look polished and attractive, and useful/relevant data is more easily accessed.However, I do not mean to say that the game is without faults. For new players to the series, there is hardly and tutorial to introduce them to the many facets of being an international super-secret alien defense force commander. This means the learning curve can be quite steep. Furthermore, the game has some frustrating line of sight issues. Sometimes, I will attempt to move my soldier to firing position, only to discover that the bush I was trying to shoot through might as well be a solid wall. Although over time I have been able to more successfully ascertain what I can and can't do, it has provided a great deal of frustration.All in all, the game is excellent, and in my oppinion more pleasurable to play than the original. (Although the punishing nature of the original adds a bit to the feel. Ironically by making it better it's worse?) Anyway, if you are a fan of strategy games or the original series then I would highly recommend you purchase this game immediately and begin fighting off the extraterrestrial invasion!			"

												Nothing is more fun than rushing headlong to fight the alien menace, and ""accidentally"" leveling half of your squad with sustained heavy machine gun fire. They might be aliens! Probably not, but why risk it? If you're a fan of the old-school XCOM games, Turn-based Strategy Games, or ""friendly fire,"" then you should pick this up. If you're not a fan of those, then buy it anyway. I mean, the Xenonauts need funding to fight the aliens, and to purchase more ammo which is strangly lacking...for some reason.			"

												This game is a quality revitalization of the original X-COM.  It not only met the high standards set by the 90s classic but also exceeded the benchmark in many ways.  - This is a global war fought by many nations that join in the fight.  Militaries around the world as well as farmers with shotguns will aid the multi-national force in its fight against the alien invasion.  Occassionally they bring down alien crafts (at terrible losses),   Allied units are represented as cops on the street, farmers blasting aliens on the other side of the farm as your troops hunt aliens around haystacks, or national militaries desperately defending the city during terror missions  - Interception missions are extremely fun - take personal control of your interceptors to bait and flank enemy crafts once your squadron catches up to an enemy flight (it could be a battleshield escorted by two fighters, or just a lone scout) - this minigame is many times more fun than X-COM's interception mission.  - Your soldiers earn medals for performing extraordinary tasks - the medals in turn boost their stats- Many weapons to choose from - riot shields (wield one with a pistol), shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, RPGs, HMGs, researched alien technologies, even a TANK that will eventually look like a real tank (upon further research).  Who doesn't want to use a tank to blow away aliens?  In X-COM games, the tank is always a tiny robo-craft that look gimpy... here we have a real tank!  - Addressed many short-comings in the original X-COM game.  You can now fly the troop transport to multiple crash sites, direct interceptors to target one group of enemy after another (assuming enough ammo and fuel left).  - It is a challenging but highly rewarding game.  It is fair (none of that enemy ""spawning"" behavior in X-COM Enemy Unknown), but it is tough.  I would rather have a tough game that is fair than an easy game with funky game logics. I am an avid X-COM player: 5 playthroughs in the original X-COM, 1 playthrough of TFTD (ok that was torture), 1 playthrough for Apocalypse, 1 playthrough in X-COM EU.  I am proud to say that Xenonaut has won me over as the quality spiritual successor that I have always been looking for.			"

												I am not going to review the mechanics of this game. There are far better game reviews out there for this. Instead this couple of paragraphs are mostly for those of you that are on the fence about purchasing this game. I purchased this game right before it came out of beta but I would have happly bought it even at its full price. The original X-Com: UFO Defense (1994 MicroProse) was a truly remarkable game and but for the graphics stands up well to games released today. Xenonauts recreates the original game (with a few extra suprises) very well. The developers have updated the graphics and improved the AI. The game is challanging even on the average setting. I have yet to try the higher settings. If you have never played the original X-Com, this game is a must. If you have played X-Com, you owe it to yourself to get this game. It will bring back memories of sitting in front of your computer for hours on end trying to destroy the alien base and save the world.So, if you are on the fence, don't be. Click the buy button. If you enjoy turn based squad action, you are going to love this game.			"

												Amazing x-com remake. If your a big fan of the original x-com you'll love this game. Don't expect anything new, its just a clone, but its extremely well done. Everything you want is there, things you wish were in x-com. For example it shows % chance to hit, travel path, etc. The graphics are very well drawn, and 2D as it should be. The writing and story are fantastic. Effort was obviously put in to make it as strategic as possible.On the down side it has a few bugs. Nothing game breaking but defiantly annoying. It has not crashed even once on me in 50 hours of play. Mostly minor issue such as if you have a unit behind a building, the building will become translucent so you can see your unit, but then when you swap to a different unit, its still translucent even though you might want to fly onto that buildings roof. You just have to eyeball where the room might be, and once he gets there it will reappear for you.			"

												Definetly has the same feeling as the original XCOM.

												A worthy successor to x-com.   The tactical worldview and interception is much better than anything any x com game has done before.  It really makes you feel like you are in the middle of a war, as opposed to the x-com satellite rush which leads to a the end game slog of knowing you won but just having to go through the motions.    Would love to see what this team could do with a newer game engine.			"

								I loved X-COM from way back in the day and I think that this game does a top notch job of carrying on the legacy. Its not at all like the simplified X-COM [which I also really enjoyed] from recent times. I feel that it captures all of the tension, heartbreak, class and openess of the original just with a facelift and more fun features. Give this game a chance because the learning curve can be steep, hell play it on easy if you have to for a while. Then look at your watch and realize you've been playing for 7 hours straight, your fingernails are gnawed down to the nub, and you are still craving more!			"

												I have owned this game for awhile back when it was an early access title, back before the official XCOM reboot released. At the time I recommended not purchasing the game due to its significant list of missing features, bugs, and poor gameplay. My review of course got condemed, but I'm a true believer in reviewing a game on how it is *now* and not what it *might* become in the future.Over a year later, here we are at the official release.Now that the game is officially finished and released I am re-doing my review to reflect on how the game is in the current state.Xenonauts takes the conecpt and gameplay that many of us fell in love with long ago with the DOS game X-Com: UFO Defense and brings that into the modern world. It isn't a direct copy however. The aliens are different, their are different weapons, different technologies, different aircraft. It takes the best of the original game, and combines it with some of the best modifications to that game. As icing on the cake, it also incorporates some of the features the XCOM reboot by Firaxis had.It keeps the isometric 2D view from the original game, but with more modern graphics. Large squad sizes are present (your first aircraft can have 8). Base defense is present. You are allowed, and required, to have multiple bases. Combat remains turn-based, and time units are very much present. That convers just about all of the complaints series fans had with the XCOM Enemy Unknown reboot.New is a more indepth aircraft interception mini-game (that's optional, you can auto-resolve if you wish). Unlike most games with an auto-resolve feature, this one doesn't screw you over with excessive losses/damage if you use it.For anyone who was a fan of the original XCOM: UFO Defense game, or new people who don't want to deal with a DOS Box game I reccomend they check out this game and give it a shot. The initial difficulty spike is quite large, but after a few games you can learn what works for you and really start to dig in.			"

												I've been playing and modding Xenonauts for a year, now.  Steam tells me I've played ~200 hours and I could easily double that with the modding and mapping I've done.Since I'd played it so much, I wanted to see how it compared to the original X-Com: UFO Defense.  So, a few months ago, I loaded it up and started a game.  Half an hour in, half way through a ground mission, I quit.  For possibly the final time, I quit one of my most favourite games of all time; a game I've played on and off since I was 8 years old.X-Com is dead; long live Xenonauts!			"

												First and foremost, this is a brilliant game. The best way I can describe it is take XCOM: Enemy Unknown of 2012 and for every graphical superiority that game has that you take away, improve and refine an aspect of gameplay.This is UFO/XCOM of 1994 as a similar IP, the aliens are named and look somewhat different, but you're looking at a lovingly crafted tribute that far surpasses it's inspiration. If you didn't play XCOM 2012 because it was different and therefore dirty compared to your rose-tinted nostalgia goggled view of UFO/XCOM then this will certainly float your nostalgic boat.Gameplay wise, believe me that the moment you research stun batons you want 3 dudes with high TU packing a baton and a riot shield. Storming a downed UFO is a cakewalk when you just stroll in and punch everybody in the face :DI only have two possible critiques and they are that while the sprites are quite detailed, you really can't tell one soldier from another so it's hard to build the kind of bond you had with your troops in XCOM 2012 and secondly the fixed isometric veiw can sometimes cause you to leave a soldier in your dropship because you forgot him/her as you can only see the top of their helmet, that's happened a couple of times but isn't even a serious problem as you might guess.If those are the only two negatives my fussy butt can think of after around maybe 20 hours playtime it really boils down to one question:Are you a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥?If not, you really should buy this game!

												Xenonauts is basically a modern remake of the original Xcom, and it retains most of its original features. -Uses TU(time units) which allows for a large diversity of actions to be taken during a turn, instead of the simplified scoot n shoot action system from Xcom:EU-Destructible Terrain: you can destroy light cover, such as haybales and low barricades, to larger things such as entire walls-Can have more than one base to operate from on the globe, and it can be placed in any exact location down to a pixel-Base building: a 6 by 6 grid that can be outfitted with a variety of structures to win the war-Base assault and defense: You can assault alien strongholds on earth and vice versa-Medium size combat teams: You get to start off with 8 units, and you can increase that amount to 10 later on.-No class restricting roles: You can equip any soldier with any item, and designate their roles as you deem fit. -Soldier Inventory system: though slightly streamlined, (no more leg or shoulder slots, just hands, belt, and backpack.) you   can equip soldiers with as much as they can carry weight/space wise. For those uninitiated into the wonder of the Xcom universe, the game basically plays as a world defense simulator. The earth gets attacked by aliens, and all of the worlds super powers are left bent over a table with their pants down. You, and your organization, the Xenonauts, are effectively the last defense we have left. You start out by placing a base on the globe, and then monitor alien activity around you via radar dishes. While things are dark, you can research alien artifacts and technology,  build new military toys, and invest in both your base and its employees. Once a Ufo is spotted, you can choose to launch a fighter or interceptor to its location to try and shoot it down. If you succeed, you'll most likely be given the option to send a mop up crew to kill off any survivors and acquire whatever the ship had aboard it. Alternatively, you can also send in an airstrike in to obliterate the crash site, netting you a small amount of cast from the pieces left. Once a crew of soldiers arrives at a crashsite or other battlefield, the game plays out in a turn based fashion. You move your soldiers around a battlefield, using various cover, weapons, and equipment to out position and destroy your foe. Whether that be by blowing a hole in the side of a building and running inside to flank an enemy, tossing a flash bang or smoke grenade to disorient and charge the enemy head on, or laying down supressive fire while a sniper gets into position and guns down an enemy. The choice is up to you. While Xenonauts does however, have its own share of faults, (Playing the same levels over and over in combat missions, predictable enemies inside downed ufos, graphics ocassionally bugging out, etc.) they are few and far between, and the game can be modded to the point where most of these things are not an issue. If you liked the original Xcom, I can almost assure you that you will love this game, and if you've never played one before, you should give it a shot.			"

												1 for 1 remastering of the 1994 game x-com enemy unkown (ufo defence to some). Kinda like the new x-com game but alot less dumbed down in a way. You mannage a base of soldiers, engineres and scientists to combat an alien invasion by shooting down aircraft and fighting aliens that land on earth. The biggest focus of the game is the ground based, turn based stategy combat.Game is very hard and not very friendly for new players with UI elements needing to be clearer for inexperienced players.But game is fair(ish), very rewarding when you get the hang of it and the atmosphere it creates is incredible.It's a game designed in the 90s: don't expect it to hold your hand, expect aliens to beat your♥♥♥♥♥			"

								Xenonauts is Xcom's less flashy, more in-depth brother: where Xcom is streamlined and sexy, Xenonauts is more tactical and strategic. In other words, where Xcom is more about how a team of super heroes saves the world by working their way up to god-like power and ability, Xenonauts is more like a real special forces sim: sooner or later, something is going to get someone (or half the team) whacked, and your going need to prepare if you don't want to lose the game. In other words, the loss hurts, but it is far more manageble than Xcom.			"

Play it on the harder difficulty and it's quite fun already and we just saw it enter beta.The UI and graphics have been upgraded multiple time and are still being worked on. It is already extremely playable.Xenonauts has the best micromanagement of the original with the suppression and new weapons of EU.

Early Access Review
								IMO, a true spiritual successor to UFO: Enemy Unknown.  Yes, it's still rough around the edges, but the dev team have made massive improvements since the very early days.  There are some Encylopedia entries that are incomplete but that's about it.  IMO the game is as solid and is playable and stable!			"

												A very faithful update of the original X-COM.  It is a perfect complement to Firaxis' offering, giving new gamers a glimpse of what so enamored us so long ago and inspired Firaxis' fine game.  It takes what was before and adds reasonable and intelligent decisions to improve the original design while keeping true to the original formula.  It is a tense, and quite difficult game, enjoy.			"

												Overall, Xenonauts is a very good and quite deep game. Definitely go for it if you can't wait for the next X-Com to come out.- Resource management is well done.- The geoscape ""sim"" mechanic is excellent.- I like air combat, but it can be skipped if it's not your thing.- Soldier progression works well and feels balanced.- Difficulty is well designed. challenging but feels fair.It has its flaws, however, Sound is scarce and poor... and graphics, regardless of being 2d (there are some beautiful looking 2D games out there), look dated (on purpose, perhaps?) and even bit unprofessional, which is a shame.

												THE GOOD:  This one is absolutely the spiritual successor to the original X-COM title from the mid-90s.  The avoid a bunch of the RPG gimmicks from the new X-COM games, and leave you with what is much more of a squad-based, turn-based strategy war game.  The atmosphere of the game is very well done, the various game mechanics and combat mechanics are very well balanced (e.g., finding the right balance in base-building between research/industry and defensive coverage of the map, finding the right balance in reserach between ground-based weapons and beefing up your interceptors, etc.).  And the nail-biting tension around losing your squad in battles was exactly the same!It  took me right back to the days of playing the original X-COM, and that is high praise indeed!There is also a small but very enthusiastic modding community for this game, so check out the Steam Workshop.THE BAD:  I found it a little bit of a grind later on in the game.  Too many repetitive base assaults, too many repetitive missions to ""kill and autopsy"" or ""capture and interrogate"" one more unfamiliar alien, and the formula of ""capture this type of alien"" to advance the main story line got a bit stale after a while.  That was after 60+ hours of delightful game play, so take that with a grain of salt.			"

												This is one of the best turn based strategy games I have ever played. It is very well made; I have seen no glitchs or bugs, and the controls make miss-clicks a rare occurence. The difficulty scale is great as well. At the lower levels, it is more forgiving for new players yet still really fun. At the higher difficulties, it requires a high level of both stategic and tactical knowledge to survive, providing a very satisfiying challenge that I have not seen since Civ V.The only problems I have with the game is that it does not tell how long some things may take to do, like researching tech and hiring new personel. This is a minor issue however, because after several playthroughs you have a general idea of how long these things may take to do.Overall, Xenonauts is a great strategy game (9 of 10) and is well worth playing.

												I am not going to review the mechanics of this game. There are far better game reviews out there for this. Instead this couple of paragraphs are mostly for those of you that are on the fence about purchasing this game. I purchased this game right before it came out of beta but I would have happly bought it even at its full price. The original X-Com: UFO Defense (1994 MicroProse) was a truly remarkable game and but for the graphics stands up well to games released today. Xenonauts recreates the original game (with a few extra suprises) very well. The developers have updated the graphics and improved the AI. The game is challanging even on the average setting. I have yet to try the higher settings. If you have never played the original X-Com, this game is a must. If you have played X-Com, you owe it to yourself to get this game. It will bring back memories of sitting in front of your computer for hours on end trying to destroy the alien base and save the world.So, if you are on the fence, don't be. Click the buy button. If you enjoy turn based squad action, you are going to love this game.			"

												Amazing x-com remake. If your a big fan of the original x-com you'll love this game. Don't expect anything new, its just a clone, but its extremely well done. Everything you want is there, things you wish were in x-com. For example it shows % chance to hit, travel path, etc. The graphics are very well drawn, and 2D as it should be. The writing and story are fantastic. Effort was obviously put in to make it as strategic as possible.On the down side it has a few bugs. Nothing game breaking but defiantly annoying. It has not crashed even once on me in 50 hours of play. Mostly minor issue such as if you have a unit behind a building, the building will become translucent so you can see your unit, but then when you swap to a different unit, its still translucent even though you might want to fly onto that buildings roof. You just have to eyeball where the room might be, and once he gets there it will reappear for you.			"

												I  only have a few hours of gameplay under my belt at this point, but at this moment I am willing to call this game incredible!  I have played and liked the Xcom remake, Silent Storm, and some of the UFO series; I consider this game to be a peer of that group, and it has qualities that make it extraordinary in it's own right.  I was worried about the graphics, if it would present barriers to imersion.  They didn't.I was worried it would be simple, a series of milk-runs.  It is not.  It presented a deep tatical chalange that I am still not equal to.  I remember the first mission where no one died.  That left me with a good feeling and a real sense of achivment.Note: I sometimes need to open Task Manager after launching the game, and end the application, if the launcher does open.  Upon retrying, the game launches without issue, and I have had no crashes.   This bug does not affect my enjoyment of the game, it is an inconvience, nothing more.			"

												This game is a quality revitalization of the original X-COM.  It not only met the high standards set by the 90s classic but also exceeded the benchmark in many ways.  - This is a global war fought by many nations that join in the fight.  Militaries around the world as well as farmers with shotguns will aid the multi-national force in its fight against the alien invasion.  Occassionally they bring down alien crafts (at terrible losses),   Allied units are represented as cops on the street, farmers blasting aliens on the other side of the farm as your troops hunt aliens around haystacks, or national militaries desperately defending the city during terror missions  - Interception missions are extremely fun - take personal control of your interceptors to bait and flank enemy crafts once your squadron catches up to an enemy flight (it could be a battleshield escorted by two fighters, or just a lone scout) - this minigame is many times more fun than X-COM's interception mission.  - Your soldiers earn medals for performing extraordinary tasks - the medals in turn boost their stats- Many weapons to choose from - riot shields (wield one with a pistol), shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, RPGs, HMGs, researched alien technologies, even a TANK that will eventually look like a real tank (upon further research).  Who doesn't want to use a tank to blow away aliens?  In X-COM games, the tank is always a tiny robo-craft that look gimpy... here we have a real tank!  - Addressed many short-comings in the original X-COM game.  You can now fly the troop transport to multiple crash sites, direct interceptors to target one group of enemy after another (assuming enough ammo and fuel left).  - It is a challenging but highly rewarding game.  It is fair (none of that enemy ""spawning"" behavior in X-COM Enemy Unknown), but it is tough.  I would rather have a tough game that is fair than an easy game with funky game logics. I am an avid X-COM player: 5 playthroughs in the original X-COM, 1 playthrough of TFTD (ok that was torture), 1 playthrough for Apocalypse, 1 playthrough in X-COM EU.  I am proud to say that Xenonaut has won me over as the quality spiritual successor that I have always been looking for.			"

Very fun, very heavy on micro managing the base and each individual soilder and their layout, as well as the randomized stats that makes it interesting. The combat is fairly large scale, in open areas, with lots of stress and caution, 8 people per squad and who knows how many aliens. Tense! Fun! Tactical.It isn't quite as logistical heavy or complicated as Xcom Apoc, but it's fun!If you liked the old xcoms, or you liked the new xcom, then you should like if not love Xenonauts!			"

For now this is the only true downside to this game, the hitchance% and how it is calculated seem totally random and erratic. No logic whatsoever and absolutely frustrating sometime.Besides that critical flaw this game truly is lots and lots of fun if you enjoy the genre and sure offers a challenge due to its difficulty			"

												A great recreation of the original X-Com, with some much appreciated improvements to air combat and simplification of the base management UI and so forth. Some drawbacks as expected - the shiny new tilesets mean you can't breach a UFO like you can all the other buildings - and money can be hard to come by if you are not dominating the air battle (which in turn means you can't produce the planes you need to dominate the air battle....). However I have sunk about 13 hours into this over the weekend and still keep wanting to see one more mission, wipe out one more alien base, save Budapest from the alien terror attacks....Big recommendation from me!

												I am an O.G.(original gamer). I started out on a commidor 64 back in the mid 80's. With that said I had x-com from the start. It was then, and still now in my memory as an amazing game that was fun, challaging, scary, and more. I loved everything about it at the time. I could go on and on but to tie this together I wish to say Xenonauts has eceeded my expectation in every way. Well done! I have been burnt out for years on games made for money, not games made by gamers who want to build a really great game. Xenonauts has restored that long lost passion I once felt while emersed into a great game. I hope you will try this game, if you do then get in a quiet dark place, kick back and dive in, you might just find your new favorite game.			"

												This is not a recreation of the original xcom. This is an improvement. Everything is a complete improvement. Instead of sending out lone interceptors to fight off lone ufos you are able to send multiple fighters after a ufo and its escorts. It also gives concrete reasons for the invasion starting off so slowly. The ufo's are not suitable for atmospheric flight and must be modified and the smaller the ufo the faster and easier the modification. It also expanded on the variety of weapons you can equip your soldiers and the utility of other weapons. For example stun gas rockets and the addition of suppressive fire giving lmgs a more significant purpose than being extra powerful rifles.			"

												This game is a good remake of XCOM: Enemy Unknown. It adds some improvements in the tactical combat screen and the Geoscape, however some things are too streamlined for my liking. An example would be not having to purchase ammo or the starting weaponry. These issues were minor for me and overall the game is very enjoyable althogh a tad expensive  at 28$ CAD for what is essentially a 2d remke, albeit a very good one. This game has excellent mod support and a great community. I personally enjoy a mod that randomizes the tactical battle scape for more interesting combat. I also use a mod that redoes the tundra and base terrain and have only ran into one bug with these mods that has not repeated. There are many other Steam Workshop mods available so there is sure to be something to suite your tastes.Congratulations to GoldHawk Interactive for stepping up and giving people what they wanted by rebuilding a classic game. I hope there will be a sequel that is similar to XCOM Apocalypse =DEdit: I am editing this review after discovering another level of tech in this game.  There are 3 tech levels plus the starting tech level for a total of 4 tech tiers. This is alot of tech to research and is a wonderful part of the game. I made a mistake when I said this game was  tad expensive. It is well priced for the amount of content available as well as the amount of support the developer/publisher give the game. Once again well done GoldHawk Interactive, you have made an excellent fan and I wish you all at GoldHawk the very best.! =D			"

								At the time of this review, the game was still in development and thus there were some glitches, bugs and balance issues.With that in mind, I still recommend this game as a somewhat successful x-com copy. Graphics arent the best, but I have to admit that old school graphics scare me more than fully detailed 3d and shiny aliens in newer games from bigger studios. the pace is quite slow and you have to ponder every move, slowly get your team into position for every corner (a thing about tactical turn based games) Difficulty wise, Xenonauts is a bit tough on beginners, however if you are reading this, that means you are after some depth and challenge in a game, anyway. For x-com veterans it should be a walk in the park (while getting killed many times by an unseen alien and reloading every now and then)Although targeted to a limited market, this game can only get better with time as developers work on it.

								What can I say about Xenonauts? Well, if you are an oldie such as I. Then you will come to appreciate old classics, like Ufo Alien defence (The old X-com), Jagged Alliance 2 and Panzer General. With the exception of Panzer General, the other two are very similar games. With their core underlying mechanics being grounded in managing a team of soldiers in accomplishing some sort off objective. How is that relevant? Well, for starters. You need to understand what this game is trying to accomplish. And that is replicating an old classic and making it more pleasing to the eye. The 'pleasing to the eye' has already been accomplished by the remake Firaxis has made. So again the question is: What does this game bring? Well it successfully manages to incorporate the core aspects that made the original Xcom so great into a neat little package that is pleasing to the eye and keeps the features rich. 'Feature Rich', that is the key here. Everyone including me loves the new remake of X-com very much, but again, if you are like me. Then you will yearn for the classics. In that case, what better then to play a pseudo remake?			"

												This game is a must have for any fan of tactical/strategy based games.If you loved X-Com you'll love this, interface is clear and simple, no clutter, easy to find what you need.the AI offers a genuine challenge, it's delightfully unforgiving so save scum often, there is lots of lore to enjoy if that's your thing and lots of researching to be done if you want to stand a chance at winning.For sure a 10/10, one for the collection of any Commander.

												This started out hard, but fun. And then psionics happened to it. For a supposedly tactical game, half your success on missions comes down to ""not failing your save against psionic enemies with unlimited range and no line of sight required"". You don't get psionics to throw back at them, you don't get any counters to it, and you have no idea where the attacks are coming from. Usually it's some enemy on the far end of the map, so you can't even try and rush them to remove the threat.It's not a challenge, it's just random rolls that occasionally mean half your team freezes and you waste a round. This game would have been better off without it, or limiting psionics to line of sight so you can do crazy OP tactics like ""scouting"" and ""planning"". Get XCom-Enemy Within, it uses actual game difficulty rather than arbitrarily zapping you.			"

												XCOM:UFO Defense was released the year I graduated. Let me clarify that I do not remember the release date because it is the same as my graduation. I remember my graduation date because of the release date. I first saw this played on a 486DX and then had to hack and upgrade my Tandy 1000EX to be able to run it. I spent $700 in 1993 money to upgrade my RAM to a whopping 768kb. In the end I upgraded machines to play this, Mechwarrior and AOE.I have also played numerous attempts at sequels, upgrades and fan made remakes. There is NOTHING that come even close to this one. This game is solid, true to it's roots and adds, answers all the things you wanted in the original without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the things that made it unique. True the last update wiped the scalable destruction but it is a small price to pay. I would spend twice the price for this.			"

Buggy Iron Man mode (Occurs when you Alt+F4 out of IronMan during Alien's Turn)5. Graphic bugs (Fixed)6. Saving gets corrupt and unplayable. (Hasn't occured since the latest patches)7.

												EDIT - (some 20 hours of gameplay later...)Having tripled my playing time and gotten deeper into the game I have gone from 'pleased' to 'impressed'. The curve at the lower levels is pretty good. You develop your newer guns, finally build and issue some, have fun for a mission or three and then suddenly 'WHAM'! New alien to bring your ego back crashing down.The air war ramps up quickly to the extent that while you start to feel you can handle everything being thrown at you on the ground, even at EASY you get the impression you just do not have enough intercepters and you never feel completely confident about handling all of the latest swarm.Having played more I have realised there are a lot more maps then I first assumed. Still not so many that you don't start recognising previous locations from time to time, but definately enough that even after 30 hours you are fighting on areas you haven't experienced before.Lot of fun, has that 'just play for a bit longer until...' attraction that easily chews up the playing hours but again, if you are not an existing XCOM fan then this game may seem a little old school to you.(end edit)(based on v1.07 and 11 hours play on Normal)Tentative THUMBS UP.Thing to remember is this game is Xenonauts, and NOT X-COM classic with better graphics. If it was sold as X-COM Classic -HD version or something similar.What that means is that, surprise! there are differences. Bases are now only one level, the world map is 2D rather then the funky globe. Some of the starting weapons and equipment from Classic either require research or are simply not within the game.Why?Because it is a different game and let's be honest, if you think classic X-COM was better, then maybe you should go play that instead (hint, I still do - or would if it wasn't so punishingly hard!! :D )The game is a bit of a mixed bag. Some of the interfaces are very simple, some (research screen I am looking at you) are downright ugly. Combat seems easier (in that it is possible to complete the early ground missions without having half your squad KIA) and the way reports of 'strange' activities pop up on the global map is interesting. You wont spot UFOs outside your radar coverage, but by looking at the reports of corp circles and abductions you can sometimes have a good idea where to send out a patrol.Ground maps are no longer randomly generated as they were in classic. On the plus side they now look a lot better, on the down side there is no longer the tenseness of simply exploring the map to work out where the drokk you actually are. Hopefully the game will add new maps with upgrades as once you have explored a map for the first time, remembering the danger spots with weird lines of sight is reasonably easy.Slightly disappointing is that crashed UFOs are no longer massively damaged when you arrive. Player's of classic will remember turning up on a crash site to find half a wall section and some un-lootable piles of smoking scrap and can breach the craft from the gapping holes your air to air missiles made in the hull. This means that every combat seems to back down to going in through the front door. Oh well.Some of the micromanangement has been removed. Everything you can't use yourself is automatically sold, so you no longer have store rooms full of stuff you are loath to get rid of.Also slightly disappointing is the study of the corpses you bring back, which are now done automatically. Gone is the choice between removing your limited science teams from the new lazer rifles you want to develop in order to study the latest hunting trophy.So, I think this is a good game. Maybe not 'great' and maybe not the sort of thing you would be interested in as an XCOM newbie trying to work out what the fuss is about.			"

												This is what I think X-COM Enemy Unknown should've been like: a balanced turn-based-strategy game that rewards your intelligence and punishes your mistakes, and ONLY your mistakes. It's challenging without finding the need to cheat.The gameplay is almost exactly like Enemy Unknown. But the few differences that are there make the game a lot more fun and a lot less frustrating. For starters, enemies no longer get a free move when you spot them, evening out the playing field. Their advantage instead comes from other abilities they have, such as regenerating damage, teleporting, flight, and psychic attacks (the latter of which has cost me more than one mission). These make them hard, but unlike X-COM where I found the game boiled down to ""shoot them until they died"", this game instead forces me to prioritize targets based on potential threat from things other than how big the aliens are and how big are the guns they're carrying. Each enemy unit merits a different approach, as it should.Your soldiers don't get specialized abilities like they do in Enemy Unknown, but they're no longer arbitrarily placed into categories by whatever confusing algorithm turned all of my soldiers in to snipers and nothing else. Their effectiveness in combat boils down to what equipment you arm them with vs. how well suited they are for that type of combat according to their stats.The air-to-air combat is FAR superior here than Enemy Unknown. There's an actual strategy element to it not that gives you more direct control of combat, allowing you to snatch victory from a 96% chance of defeat with some creative flight control and use of weapons.The world map is also much improved. Rather than build satellites to watch over whole continents, you instead build bases at points where you can cover the most land with your limited radar. And aliens can always attack your bases, setting you back and possibly costing you the game if they're not properly defended. The limited space you have to build aircraft will more often than not force you to guess which ships pose more of a threat than others, until later in the game when you can build an intel array to spell it out for you.Eventually, your equipment will outmatch that of the aliens', but said equipment is costly and takes far more time than is practical to build. What makes this and pretty much every other step forward in Xenonauts work, though, is that your triumphs only come after numerous successful missions and God knows how many soldiers lost to the enemy.And, lastly, f**k those f**king Reapers.

												My first and only playthrough (veteran difficulty) took 149 hours and hundreds of reloads. Midway I kind of grew tired of the ground combat, as it varies only so much, and just airstriked most of the downed UFOs instead. I can't really see any replay value after such a long playthrough, so I probably won't play this game again anytime soon. It just took too long for me to finish it.That said, the game has a couple of things speaking for it. It has a big research treea lot of different airplanes and vehicles to research and buildnewer weapon types really feel like they make a difference in combata pretty world mapand last but not least: solid tactical gameplay. When you start to underestimate the AI, you will be punished. I myself would never dare try the Ironman mode - my heart would probably ragequit after a couple of rounds.Graphics and sounds are nothing special, but adequate.After some concideration I give this game a thumbs up. Just don't expect it to feel fresh in a longer run.			"

Remember how everything was just mysterious and cutting edge?  Yeah.  Great wasn't it?  Tried it recently?   I played it recently and... Um... *Sigh*  Yeah.   So Xenonauts is like the lens through which we remember the original X-Com's greatness.  Yes, it is almost exactly the same game,,, with all (ok... most) of the flaws removed and some needed modern bells and whistles added.  Seriously.  If you like the way you remember how X-Com was, way back when.  Do yourself a favor and DON'T play it now.  Play this instead.  Keep your happy memories in tact.  ...And if you didn't play X-Com: UFO Defense way back in the day...

												THIS was the X-COM 'sequel' I was hoping for.  I absolutely love this game.I love the 70/80's style graphics.  It really adds a nice feel to the game.  They are finely detailed, not intentionally dated as seems to be the trend with indie games now a days.  And anyone who has tried modding the unit graphics knows what sort of attention was put into these!That brings me to my favorite thing about this:  Modding!  Man, you can change virtually anything and everything in the game if you know where to look.  Add entire tiers of weapons or armor, including their 'pedia pages.  Change the stats on weapons, how your guys level up, you name it!  I even created a dart gun mod that is currently over on their official webpage.I think the biggest con, if I had to pick one, is that it is done in the Diner Dash engine.  This apparently severely limited what the developer could do with it.  But even with that limitation, Chris still came through with an absolutely stunning game.If you like the old X-COM games, You should enjoy this.  It is well worth the money, I promise!			"

												It captures the feel of the old X-Coms very well. There's base management and missions. The base economy is pretty shallow, however, and there's not really much you can do there. You ahve to guess what the rooms do, as there's no tutorial.The fighting part of the game is O.K, but after a while it gets boring with the limited amount of equipment and maps. The cover system seems not to be working at all / is random and the vision seems similalrly random. The enemeis can easily one-shoot you, but they're dumb like a sack of bricks msot of the time, sitting in their crashed down UFO, doing nothing whole game.All in all, if you're feelnig nostalgic, check this out on  sale, like I did. Otherwise, wait for XCom 2, like I'm doing.			"

												If you enjoyed the original X-COM: UFO Defense, this is a good update.  The graphics feel a bit dated, sharp but only isometric and unrotatable.  The only drawback, I find, is that the game seems to drag.  I'm over 100 UFOs having been encountered, and while it seems I'm on the final leg of the technology tree, I'm not in a position to finish the game.  The difficulty feels about right at the easiest level, but there are still situations where soldiers die and there's nothing you can do to have prevented it (except going back and reloading a save game) ... the 'it kills you if it gets too close' monster is a bit much, when plasma torpedoes can be resisted by armor.

												Not a bad game overall.  Very similar to X-COM UFO Defense but graphics are better.  The technology treee is good too.  Some issues I have: --No way to judge or measure psionic power or resistance.  My bravest soldiers become alienized no matter what I do.--Unable to shoot weapons when in airborne levitating suits.  Very frustrating.--Program tends to lock up when using alien transporter and alien shoots you at the same time.  Happened every time.--No ability to downgrade weapons for base defense.  Not sure about this one.--Weapon aiming system for soilders could be tweeked.  Tend to miss targets at very close range.  --Money is very hard to come by.  It costs more money to make something than the selling price.  At least in X-COM, I          could make something for 15000 and sell it for 20000.  Not so in Xenonauts .--More emphasis on soilders would be nice.  Building thier abilites and skills could be better.--Better armour on vehicles.--Better armour or at least more choices for soilder armour.--More single random alien attacks would be nice instead of a barrage of 10 alien ships attacking globally at once.--Battle sites need more randomizing.  All battles seem the same after a while.  For example, why not have a crashed            alien ship with only 1 alien alive.--Allow more Xenonaut soldiers in a battle.  I think the limit is 10?  Not sure about this one.I only have have 150 hours so playing the game.  I haven't read the rule book so I may have missed a few things or made some errors with my analysis shown above.  I managed to get to the end game but did not defeat the Master Preator or whateve it's called (at least not yet).  This was my third try after the first two attempts failed (mostly due to lack of money).  This was also done using the the ""easy"" setting.  It wasn't very easy.Overall, a good game that I recommend for those who like strategy games.  I think with some fine tuning, this game could rival the original X-COM in popularity and playability.  I give it a 7 out of 10 rating. "

												Essentially, this is an alternate universe version of XCOM harkening back to the classic titles and done fully in 2D. And how good is that 2d? I love it. Huge respect to the team at Goldhawk for going all in and not taking the easy way out with halfassed 2.5D/3D. In my opinion being 2D really adds to the classic vibe.Compared to Firaxis' XCOM this definitely feels like an older game. It's more complex, much more challenging outside of ground combat. In XCOM you basically only need to worry about ground combat. In Xenonauts you have to maintain multiple bases, multiple teams of soldiers, cast a wide enough net of radars to protect as much of the earth as you can, and manage your air force against the waves of UFOs that even threaten to attack your bases if left unharassed (and if they do they aliens will come in and try to break all your stuff). And all that before you even get to the ground combat. Both games feature similar research that provides gear that you need to stay on even keel with the aliens who get progressively more powerful, and the research also drives the story along in both. Though Xenonauts doesn't really have a story in the way the XCOM does, in Xenonauts the narrative is your own, there's no cutscenes or dialogue or anything.The ground combat is also much more complex in Xenonauts, choosing to use ""time units"" rather than XCOM's two actions per soldier method. Most weapons have several firing modes available taking different amounts of time units, switching weapons (or grenades) takes time units, etc. Also cover much always always always be used, a soldier left in the middle of the street is liable to get shot by an alien you can't see.One major gripe I have with Xenonauts' ground combat is that downed UFOs only have one way in, the front door. This means you have to funnel your troops in through the front door where a bunch of well armed aliens are sitting waiting violate you. The combat requires well thought out tactics in order to survive, and yet you're forced to charge headlong at angry aliens, ehhhh.On the whole, Xenonauts is a more calculating, complex, slower paced game. XCOM is snappier and more gamey. They both offer a different approach to the alien invasion. Xenonauts is a more niche take to XCOM's mainstream accessibility. Personally, while I recommend this game to XCOM fans or fans of tactical strategy type games, I don't know how much more I can withstand, it's very stressful. It's always heartbreaking to lose your elite guys in XCOM, but in Xenonauts I just keep losing everything, game's hard man!			"

												If you like the original xcom games this is very similar, but after playing the recent xcom games its seems very dull by comparison with the combat being slow and boring.

												I really have enjoyed the short time I have put into this game. After one Ironman run where I ultimately have to restart, I couldn't be happier! The amount of depth and customization is really great! I enjoy a lot of things about this game, and as someone who got into the Xcom series a bit late.. I find the UI preferable to the classics and the title a good way to experience the old elements of the xcom series that didn't carry over to the newest release. A good game in it's own right, and a good route to go if you want something harder in the same genre as enemy unknown/within. A great spiritual successor to the older entires and brings back memories of old school TBS gaming.The few little problems I have run across are more than overlookable.I am quite glad to see where this game has gone, being hesitant at first to hop on it until more development was accomplished! I would say in it's current state it is a quality product, well worth the price tag!			"

												If you liked the original X-Com and/or Terror From the Deep, you'll probably like this. Xenonauts is a more logical evolution of the gameplay of the older X-Com games than the new 2015 X-Com is. It uses time-units, you can pick up stuff from the ground or put it down, take weapons off dead enemies, etc. There is actual gameplay on the geoscape, multiple bases, etc.It adds a interceptor minigame that's decent, and for the most part removes annoying psionics. Sadly part of that is that there's none for you.Overall, I had a lot of fun with it.			"

												I've played thousands of hours of old X-COM (UFO Defense, Terror From The Deep, Apocalypse), and over 500 hours of Enemy Unknown/Within.  I'm enjoying Xenonauts tremendously.  Details follow, but if you're a fan of the old-school X-COM games, I'm already telling you that you should check this game out.Xenonauts describes itself as a ""spiritual successor"" to X-COM.  It's important to note that they were very probably not talking about Enemy Unknown/Within; the differences in polish will disappoint you if you're expecting that level of visual quality.  However, as a successor to -old- X-COM (UFO Defense, Terror From The Deep, Apocalypse) it succeeds pretty brilliantly.The look and feel of the Geoscape is very UFOD/TFTD (only much prettier), while the tactical aesthetics are much more like Apocalypse turn-based mode.  Bases have radar ranges determined by the number and quality of detection facilities present, but the range limits are far more visible than in previous games.  This makes it far easier to understand the coverage consequences of base placement. Ship Combat:  X-COM ship fights (even in EU/EW) are like sumo wrestling.  The ships' locations on the field are completely abstracted away, and there are hit percentages simulating mobility, so you see two craft holding relatively still and slugging at each other.  Misses look more like bad aiming than evasive action.In Xenonauts, the ship combat display is a 2D grid wherein momentum and turning radius count.  Weapons have ranges and firing arcs, ammo and fuel count, afterburners are a thing (but see: fuel counts) and missiles have their own maneuverability values.  Defensive maneuvers exist for evasive actions, and a dogfight isn't always 1:1 -- in fact, encounters can get up to 3 vs. 3 in some cases; as UFO's begin to appear with escorts, and fighter squadrons roam in packs daring your interceptors to come out and play, you respond by sending attack groups instead of lone planes.  There are light and heavy interceptor classes, with maneuverability, range and armament consequences.  You can't form an attack group out of craft from more than one base, unfortunately.  I'd have loved to see a rendezvous point system wherein disparate fleets could join up, but ship combat is a fun, complex mini-game in and of itself and a strategy guide could be (and probably has been) written just for that facet of gameplay.  NOTE:  There are -way- more UFO's in the early part of the game than in any iteration of X-COM.  This becomes important during...Ship Combat Aftermath:You can send troops to fight at a crash site, but that's not always an option.  You probably don't have enough strike teams to cover every site where you've shot something down, especially early on when a single Condor is still a match for anything the aliens field.  Rather than letting the sites rot and taking a PR penalty with the nation where they crashed, Xenonauts provides the option to call an airstrike and saturate that area, then send a non-combatant cleanup team to salvage what it can.  This results in a static amount of cash based on the class of crashed craft, and a few recoverable items, but no soldier experience or personnel equipment captures.Soldier Management:  Enemy Unknown/Within introduced the concept of soldier classes; a Rookie, upon promotion to Squaddie, was assigned one of four classes.  That class distinction determined what stats increased when the soldier was promoted, what weapons the soldier was allowed to carry, and what special abilities became available to that soldier as rank increased.  It's a novel concept, but there are downsides.  Class assignment is for life, for one thing, and there's little room for creative misuse of inventory -- you can't load down an Assault trooper with grenades, for instance.  Nonlethal weapons were considered Items rather than weapons in EU/EW, as well, which meant that you had to choose between that and grenades, or extra armor, or whatever else.  It added importance to the range of choices, but only by limiting them. Xenonauts doesn't have classes, but it does allow you to assign a soldier a role.  The main differences are that any role can technically carry any equipment; there are customizable default equipment templates for each role; you can change a soldier's role in the barracks anytime the soldier is on base; and you can create new roles.  Weapon disparity is a little wider, and there is in fact a ""laser shotgun"" and other mechanics-only nonsense, but in general the strategic and tactical choices you can make in Xenonauts is far wider and more granular than in its ancestors.Tactical Combat:Oh, man.  Where to start.  Quick list of things that don't require explanation:- Stun rockets are a thing.  You get them as soon as you get stun grenades.- You don't have to wait half the game to get stun grenades.- Nonlethal melee weapons exist, and they're weapons -- not some other item class.- All soldiers carry an infinite number of flares!  (But vehicles don't.)- Vision arcs are back.  An unarmored human has a 90-degree effective vision arc.  (Heavy armor can reduce this.)- Cover is not a light switch like in EU/EW, but rather a stack of calculated obstruction percentages like in older X-COM titles.  Stuff that might require some more description:- Range matters a lot.  Different weapons are optimized either for long-range armor-piercing fire, or massive trauma at point-blank range.  You have to make sure you send the right soldier for the right tactical situation, all the time; the aliens are as merciless as they ever were in TFTD, and a soldier caught at a disadvantage is very probably toast.- Area denial is a real thing.  Enough shell-shock (automatic weapons fire, explosives, etc.) in the immediate vicinity of a soldier (human or enemy) can cause them to become Suppressed, which takes away their TU's (no reaction fire from that soldier), and reduces the TU's they get next turn by 50% (no burst fire, probably no grenades, just movement adjustments OR one decent shot).  Heavy weapons and vehicle weapons are wonderful for this, but remember ammo is being counted.- Reaction fire is not solely a function of the reacting soldiers' statistics -- reaction initiative is calculated using (get this) modifiers determined by the weapons and equipment worn by both the active and reactive soldiers, Reaction stats, and *TU's the reacting player has left*.  That doesn't just mean that low TU's result in snap shots; it means that high TU's can result in normal or snap shots, and low TU's can lead to the reactive soldier being unable to respond fast enough even though he technically has enough TU's to take a shot.  In addition, assault weapons actually inflict a reaction penalty on anyone calculating reaction fire against them; carrying a shotgun actually makes it much more likely that you'll get the first shot in a point-blank, room-to-room encounter.Summary:The mechanics of Xenonauts are closer to what I've always wanted X-COM to be.  I'm not in love with the tactical display's graphical quality, but if there's a sequel, I'll look for that to improve.  Meanwhile, the game is a beautiful example of this game type, and the creation and maintenance of it is behavior we enthusiasts should reward by burying the developers in enough money that they decide it would be crazy not to make another one.

												This is a pretty sweet game, killer soundtrack, great gameplay, spooky aliens, pages upon pages of lore in the xenopedia complete with a free novella recounting first contact. This is what I wish Enemy Unknown had been and I was never even one to be nostalgic of the originals mostly because I hadn't played them but to compare them side by side this, to me at lest, is simply a better strategy game. Each and every difficulty setting is a challenge even easy mode but then again I'm a dumb dumb, I couldn't really recommend it more I haven't found an aspect of it that pisses me off at all. The first time I took a look at the manually controlled air combat I said out loud ""Why did I click on this button? It was a guaranteed victory."" But I did not then understand that it was fantastic air combat not to mention that you'll be better off engaging a target manually if your percentage for victory is less then seventy because you can do what a computer cannot, fight for the survival of humanity with some gumption.Anyways it's got big women, big money and big fun. Scratch the big money though because it's only twenty-five bucks so hook yourself up with a sweet game.			"

												A remake of the original TBS classic X-Com:UFO Defence from the 90s.If you played any of the original Microprose X-Coms and were disappointed with the Firaxis reboot's lack of depth, then Xenonauts will not disappoint.It plays very similar to the original X-COM with some extra polish as you'd expect 20 years later.My favourite aspect is that the game has been opened up to the modding community, and there are some great mods out there that vastly expand the tech trees, maps, equipment etc etc.If you aren't familiar with the original, the game is split into a strategy layer, where you intercept UFOs, build up your bases, equip your troops and aircraft, do research etc, and a turn-based squad combat layer where you investigate crashed and landed UFOs, alien bases, terror sites etc.You never have enough money to do everything you want, and the difficulty ramps up as the invasion progresses. The graphics may seem a bit antiquated, but it's all about the gameplay, and rolling out your strategy for defeating the alien invasion.The ambient music is excellent, and the hours fly by as you get immersed in the game.In my opinion, a must-buy for any fans of the original series, and recommended for any TBS fans.

Hint: When in combat use your right mouse click to set the number of APs you will use - the slider on the lower right is for conserving APs to do those actions, you still have to manually set how many APs you are going to use when shooting for a snap, normal or aimed shot.Enjoy!

												What a fond drive down memory lane this game is. For those of us old enough to remember the original X-com, this game will bring back happy and deliciously frustrating memories of that wonderful classic. What the current bearers of the X-com flame have failed to deliver,  the makers of Xenonauts have. We don't need a cheesey 1950's gimmick, or a story line that no one really cares about. We just want to play turn based combat with aliens like we had in the old days. The original X-com was frustrating, easy to get into, yet difficult to master and insanely addictive, Xenonauts is all of that, and more.   This game gives the gamer hours of deep strategic thinking, but without the tedious busy work of many other strategy games. You build your bases, improve your technology, hire and fire researchers, engineers and soldier, try your best to manage your budget (which is more important than one would assume), and all of this while fighting for humanity's very survival, on interesting battlefields all over the globe.     This game is wonderful for those of us who stayed up until dawn in the 90's playing the original, and for younger or newer gamers who want to have that same experience. Take it from an old school PC gamer, if you want all of the fun of the good old DoS days, but with a bit of a graphic and processing revamp, this is it.			"

												Better than the original XCOM? Yes - much less micromanagement, improved air combat & UIBetter than the recent XCOM reboot? Yes - ground combat much closer to the original (more realistic focus on cover and visibility), overall it feels less scripted and linearSo, the definitive version of one of the best strategy games ever made then? Yes!For those unfamiliar with the original XCOM, it's a fairly standard base management game punctuated by possibly the most tense, terrifying turn-based squad elements you'll ever play. It's arguably the greatest game created by two giants of the computer game industry, Julian Gollop & Sid Meier.The only slight criticism for me is that I preferred the droney music of the original which increased the atmosphere. Also, I'm pretty sure they've (rather naughtily) lifted sections of Ennio Morricone's score for The Thing!I also recommend downloading the free Community Edition update for more maps and improved UI. Xenonauts 2 is in production!			"

												TL;DR = It can be good, even great at times. It can also be horribly frustrating and feels exceptioannly dated for a recent release. For genre veterans its certainly worth a playthrough, but nascent players are better off starting with the recent XCom: EW, Wasteland 2, or Shadowrun: Dragonfall. 7.5/10 Xenonauts follows in the tradition of the original XCom, which focuses on tactical turn-based gameplay coupled with an over-arching strategic layer involving the establishment and maintainence of multiple bases. The strategic portion includes the recruitment of new soldiers, dubbed ""xenonauts"", as well as the research and production of myriad new technologies. This tech ranges from new weapons and equipment for your xenonauts to new vehicles and enhanced base defenses to help ward off attacks from the alien invaders. The tactical portion is a turn-based affair that utilizes time units (or ""TUs"") that are used for every action your xenonauts undertake, from movement and reloading to crouching and the use of weapons and medkits. The graphics on display are fairly archaic, and would not have been out-of-place in a mid 90s PC release. While servicable, they are nothing to write home about. The sound has a similar presentation, possessing a distorted quality that lies somewhere between the NES and SNES in terms of depth and range. The gameplay itself is a mixed bag of engaging tactics and uneven difficulty spikes. Each of your xenonauts has a sight cone that allows only the portion of the screen being directly looked at to be uncovered. The rest is shrouded in a shaded fog-of-war where aliens can lurk and undertake actions without being noticed by nearby xenonauts. This sight cone is excpetionally small, and can lead to many instances of ""cheap"" deaths wherein an alien attacker has clear line of sight on your xenonauts whereas your soldiers cannot see them, despite looking specifically in the direction of the attacker. There are also Chrysallid-type enemies that should be familiar to any veteran XCom player, which will routinely charge from behind the fog-of-war and one-hit kill the closest xenonaut. The type of armor equipped has no bearing on this, as even the top-tier provides absolutely zero protection against one-hit kills from this particular enemy type. The turn-by-turn gameplay is hampered by this and the uneven execution in the RNG (random number generator) system, leading to a ""turtling"" strategy as the most viable option available to players. Oftentimes your xenonauts will miss the majority of shots during a turn, whereas the aliens appear to benefit from not only increased range, sight, and damage dealt, but also a higher hit incidence. This leads to an understandable level of frustration as the deck feels stacked against you in many encounters, leading to the tried-and-true turtling strategy previously referenced. Players who felt at home with the recent XCom:EW release will likely find the systems used in Xenonauts a bit tedious and challenging in all the wrong ways.Despite these shortfalls, I still recommend Xenonauts to players who enjoyed the XCom series, or other genre staples such as Wasteland and Shadowrun. I would certainly recommend Wasteland 2, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, or XCom: EW over Xenonauts to nascent players of turn-based tactical games due to the latter's steep learning curve and decidedly old-school ambience, mechanics, and presentation. Xenonauts, however, is definitely worth a look for others who have already played those other aforementioned titles and are still looking to scratch their tactical gameplay itch. The strategic layer is deep and engrossing, and the tactical gameplay can be engaging and rewarding when running at its best. Just be aware that the gameplay systems on display feel fairly dated and battles can be tedious affairs that sometimes feel ""cheap"", but in the end the game as a whole can feel rewarding and become deeply addictive in the way that only the best turn-based strategy games can. Score: 7.5Recommended? YES, with reservations			"

												I highly recommend anyone who loved the xcom series to purchase this game. This game made my play it more than 100 hours, to fully research the tech tree and get a highly capable squad. It's also forgiving for casual gamersGood-Good ground combat feel. A.I is good but still forgiving for casual gamers-Though others might think otherwise, I like the cover system in which how obstacles block shots.-Large variety of alien beings and crafts to defeat and also researchBad-Graphics aren't top notch.-Repetitive maps after a while.-Some enemy units may be overpowered while others become inconsequential later in the game.

												By Marys left♥♥♥♥♥this game is good!Like the original Xcom, but better in almost everyway. But thats expected when so much time has passed.Compared to the modern Xcom, id pick this over it. Modern Xcom is fun, dont get me wrong, but it feels very.... flat. Xenonauts on the otherhand is a game that feels more alive and interactive. There is more to this than Xcom as well. If its on your wishlist, i suggest you remove and put it in your library instead			"

												Xenonauts is easily the best Turn Based Tactics/Strategy game I've played in long time. I did not play the original XCOM or even the other spinoffs, so this review won't help you if you're looking at it from that perspective.We'll start with the core of the game, combat. Send your elite commandos all over the world to accomplish many different objectives. The combat is turned based, so you have plenty of time to think about your strategy, which is really important because around every corner, you're soldiers could meet their death. The better armed and usually physically stronger alien invaders have a clear advantage. If you're careless, you're dead. Customize your soldiers with gear/weapons to suite the role you want them to play and to suite your tactical preference, but watch out....when they're dead their dead for good along with all the expensive gear you may have equipped them with. You'll face many different types of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. You'll need to adjust you tactics nearly every mission, depending on what you're facing and what area of the world you're in Urban/Rural/Desert/Arctic. The maps can get a little repetitive, apparently there are not that many, but there are plenty of map mods available or you can make your own.The second part of the game is managing your military, as a whole.  You begin the game facing an enemy who has a clear technological advantage, but thorugh research you can implement Alien technology for your own purposes, but it's expensive and time consuming, so chose wisly. Playing the game on normal, you'll always feel one step behind the aliens as they ramp up their invasion. You'l need to build bases to protect the nations of the world, who are funding you! Let too many aliens thorugh, an you'll lose the nation, loose too many nations game over man.I have about 40 hours in so far and I can highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys thinking tactically or strategically. It's a fun game you can play for 30 minutes at a time or settle in for a good 6 hour marathon. The combat can get a little repretive in the beginning, but as the game progresses I actually started to notice it less. I also downloaded some map mods too.I would give it 4 out of 5 and a must have for lovers of strategy. "

It takes the gritty, granular tactics of UFO Defense, and adds a fresh coat of paint and some new controls. The art and setting are distinctly darker and more realistic than XCOM's cartoony superheroes, and the gameplay is waaay more stressful (enjoy getting shot at from offscreen!)Highly recommended if you found 2012 XCOM wanting in some ways.

												The game may still be in beta but if you still remember the old XCOM games, get this. P.S. Now I am doing review for the final release. The game still has some bugs but honestly beta bugs were wrose. It is still a solid XCOM game. It does have certain things missing like base facilities descriptions and that some missions are either very open layout or very close. You will feel overpowerd in the beggining and the moment you seem to meet the aliens at equal footing, you will get screwed again ... just like in XCOM. The major difference is that while alens have psychis powers, you soldeirs will never get them. I honestly dont mind that fact that original XCOM powers were super overpowering once you got ahold of them. So if you looking for nostalgia trip or a propwer XCOM succesor, this is your game.			"

												Probably more X-com than the official X-com sequels, Xenonauts stays true to the original gameplay of ""UFO Defense"" and ""Terror from the Deep."" While graphically the game is to sterile or cheery, this can be quickly remedied with mod support, which the game supports fully. Using mods you can increase the number of maps and weapons to a huge amount, and bring some limits to the ""free grenades"" and ""free ammo"" the game defaults with to bring it more in line to the original game.Unfortunately the devs(dev?) doesn't seem to want to incorporate the great mods that enhance the game into the product itself, which means that with new versions of the game mods are constantly breaking, which in turn makes the game a chore to play because if you don't want your game crashing constantly you will have to wait for each modder to individually update the mod into the game.

For now this is the only true downside to this game, the hitchance% and how it is calculated seem totally random and erratic. No logic whatsoever and absolutely frustrating sometime.Besides that critical flaw this game truly is lots and lots of fun if you enjoy the genre and sure offers a challenge due to its difficulty			"

I spent $700 in 1993 money to upgrade my RAM to a whopping 768kb. In the end I upgraded machines to play this, Mechwarrior and AOE.I have also played numerous attempts at sequels, upgrades and fan made remakes. There is NOTHING that come even close to this one. This game is solid, true to it's roots and adds, answers all the things you wanted in the original without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the things that made it unique.

								Most games find it difficult to provide a challenge, and make it feel fair, most end up having situations in which your character or characters are killed, and you feel cheated at tge way it happened, it normally feels like a cheap shot.Not in Xenonauts though.If a soldier is killed, you don´t feel like the game pulled a♥♥♥♥♥♥move, no, you know it was your fault, that you ♥♥♥♥ed up, and that you ♥♥♥♥ed up hard.Even then, losing soldiers is part of the game, the game clearly tells us that for all your preparations and tactics, you are still going to lose men and women to a much superior foe, and even if you start closing the gap, that it will keep happening, and happening, and there´s not much that you can do about it.But, that´s the alure of Xenonauts, a game that manages to strike a balance between challenge and fun.So, in short, this is a well recommended game.

								The Bad: There are many little niggles with this game, but they don't add up to a huge niggle that will spoil your enjoyment. I kinda hope that Goldhawk can continue to spend time in the future to patch up this game so it approximates the vision they clearly have been reaching for.The Good: The AI is to die by. I've seen good AI previously in AI War, and this rates with it. This has the best UFOpedia that I've seen in any X-Com-a-like game, combining great visuals with amusing entries. The modding community is amazing - I've never seen such creativity outside of a Bethesda game!			"

								Mostly like the original X-Com, or at least it manages to come closer than any of the other attempts to re-create it. Most if not all of the new features and quality of life improvements are going to anger the grognards (""WTF!!!! destroyed interceptors are replaced automatically!?!? I have infinte flares?! what is this babies first strategy game?!?"") but for people not living in a magical fantasy land where in all the good games stopped being made around 1994 these improvements will be welcome. I still like EU/EW and the original X-Com better, but this is still good.			"

								Xenonauts is a wonderful clone of the original XCOM - UFO DEFENSE and is in many ways a better experience. Xenonauts is more intuitive and pretty than its predecesor as well as creating the same feeling that you are juggling 9001 balls at once, and are constantly a few poor choices away from total collapse. All in all, the game is a great experience.Although I have not completed the game, just scratched the surface really (I've played three months in-game), I can say for certain that all of the difficulty of the original game is present. Every desicion is vital and it is imperative to really consider the best course of action at all times. If you don't, well, let's say there have been more than a few missions which resulted in complete annihilation of my squad, a terrible loss.The game is also much more faithful to the original than XCOM - ENEMY UNKNOWN, bringing back TU's, much larger squads, and a more complicated geoscape portion of the game. In many respects, though, it improves on the original. The OP Blaster bomb has been removed, the graphics look polished and attractive, and useful/relevant data is more easily accessed.However, I do not mean to say that the game is without faults. For new players to the series, there is hardly and tutorial to introduce them to the many facets of being an international super-secret alien defense force commander. This means the learning curve can be quite steep. Furthermore, the game has some frustrating line of sight issues. Sometimes, I will attempt to move my soldier to firing position, only to discover that the bush I was trying to shoot through might as well be a solid wall. Although over time I have been able to more successfully ascertain what I can and can't do, it has provided a great deal of frustration.All in all, the game is excellent, and in my oppinion more pleasurable to play than the original. (Although the punishing nature of the original adds a bit to the feel. Ironically by making it better it's worse?) Anyway, if you are a fan of strategy games or the original series then I would highly recommend you purchase this game immediately and begin fighting off the extraterrestrial invasion!			"

								What can I say about Xenonauts? Well, if you are an oldie such as I. Then you will come to appreciate old classics, like Ufo Alien defence (The old X-com), Jagged Alliance 2 and Panzer General. With the exception of Panzer General, the other two are very similar games. With their core underlying mechanics being grounded in managing a team of soldiers in accomplishing some sort off objective. How is that relevant? Well, for starters. You need to understand what this game is trying to accomplish. And that is replicating an old classic and making it more pleasing to the eye. The 'pleasing to the eye' has already been accomplished by the remake Firaxis has made. So again the question is: What does this game bring? Well it successfully manages to incorporate the core aspects that made the original Xcom so great into a neat little package that is pleasing to the eye and keeps the features rich. 'Feature Rich', that is the key here. Everyone including me loves the new remake of X-com very much, but again, if you are like me. Then you will yearn for the classics. In that case, what better then to play a pseudo remake?			"

												This game has the same feel as the original X-Com, much more so than the Firaxis remake. While the remake has a small team, they tend to feel more like some sort of action movie super team. In Xenonauts, your team dies. And dies. And dies some more. When you reveal the map, you only increase the tension for those places still hidden, the awareness growing that as you eliminate hiding places you are only closing the range and make it easier for the unknown enemies to perforate your squad with vastly superior firepower. The fire superiority enjoyed by your foes makes no difference to the mission generator, often outnumbering your soldiers as well. You deliberately harden your heart to avoid becoming too attached to that one officer who can move a quarter way across the map and still have time units and accuracy to put a shot through an alien's eye because you know it's just a matter of time until...BANG! And your favorite is a crumpled corpse on the ground, not even identified by name.Then you finish the mission (if it's not a total wipe), go back to base, and hire some more, ready to do it again.

You mannage a base of soldiers, engineres and scientists to combat an alien invasion by shooting down aircraft and fighting aliens that land on earth. The biggest focus of the game is the ground based, turn based stategy combat.Game is very hard and not very friendly for new players with UI elements needing to be clearer for inexperienced players.But game is fair(ish), very rewarding when you get the hang of it and the atmosphere it creates is incredible.It's a game designed in the 90s: don't expect it to hold your hand, expect aliens to beat your♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Xenonauts is in essence an X-COM game after the spirit of the orignal title. I enjoyed the recent Firaxsis XCOMs and, obviously, they are graphically superior to Xenonauts, however Xenonauts has a greater depth of strategic play. Like in the original X-COM, Time Units allow your soldiers to perform complex tasks on the battlefield and this puts paid to my biggest beef with the Firaxsis games. Just like in olden times Soldiers can now shoot then move then crouch and turn, open doors and reload and these actions can be performed in any order as long as there are sufficient time units available to them. No longer will a reload always end my turn and no longer do I need a soldier with a special skill to be able to shoot then move! This alone makes Xenonauts eminently playable for anyone interested in the genre and is one of many areas that the game gets right.			"

												My first impression of this game is a solid thumbs-up. I think it's a very nice modernization/update to the original X-COM UFO Defense/Enemy Unknown. The general theme seems to be elimination of some of the more mundane ""bean counting"" aspects of the game and tighter focus on the combat while still providing a reasonable degree of realism and good challenge.I never liked managing soldier Energy, and I actually rather like the elimination of the Workshop Economy because that always seemed a tad cheesy to me. The removal of the rank cap (that is to say, any number of soldiers can be any rank at any given time) is also a very nice concession to organization.The UI is a lot tighter and makes great use of modern resolutions. The air-to-air combat - while occasionally frustrating - does allow an appreciated injection of player skill. My first terror mission - despite being against the game's weakest alien race - was still an unrelenting exercise in creeping dread.I do feel like there is a challenging balance between how much air-to-air vs air-to-ground combat you do, and I'm not sure if that's a game issue or an issue with my playstyle. Either way, I'm having a blast and see myself dumping far too many hours into this game. "

												I've played thousands of hours of old X-COM (UFO Defense, Terror From The Deep, Apocalypse), and over 500 hours of Enemy Unknown/Within.  I'm enjoying Xenonauts tremendously.  Details follow, but if you're a fan of the old-school X-COM games, I'm already telling you that you should check this game out.Xenonauts describes itself as a ""spiritual successor"" to X-COM.  It's important to note that they were very probably not talking about Enemy Unknown/Within; the differences in polish will disappoint you if you're expecting that level of visual quality.  However, as a successor to -old- X-COM (UFO Defense, Terror From The Deep, Apocalypse) it succeeds pretty brilliantly.The look and feel of the Geoscape is very UFOD/TFTD (only much prettier), while the tactical aesthetics are much more like Apocalypse turn-based mode.  Bases have radar ranges determined by the number and quality of detection facilities present, but the range limits are far more visible than in previous games.  This makes it far easier to understand the coverage consequences of base placement. Ship Combat:  X-COM ship fights (even in EU/EW) are like sumo wrestling.  The ships' locations on the field are completely abstracted away, and there are hit percentages simulating mobility, so you see two craft holding relatively still and slugging at each other.  Misses look more like bad aiming than evasive action.In Xenonauts, the ship combat display is a 2D grid wherein momentum and turning radius count.  Weapons have ranges and firing arcs, ammo and fuel count, afterburners are a thing (but see: fuel counts) and missiles have their own maneuverability values.  Defensive maneuvers exist for evasive actions, and a dogfight isn't always 1:1 -- in fact, encounters can get up to 3 vs. 3 in some cases; as UFO's begin to appear with escorts, and fighter squadrons roam in packs daring your interceptors to come out and play, you respond by sending attack groups instead of lone planes.  There are light and heavy interceptor classes, with maneuverability, range and armament consequences.  You can't form an attack group out of craft from more than one base, unfortunately.  I'd have loved to see a rendezvous point system wherein disparate fleets could join up, but ship combat is a fun, complex mini-game in and of itself and a strategy guide could be (and probably has been) written just for that facet of gameplay.  NOTE:  There are -way- more UFO's in the early part of the game than in any iteration of X-COM.  This becomes important during...Ship Combat Aftermath:You can send troops to fight at a crash site, but that's not always an option.  You probably don't have enough strike teams to cover every site where you've shot something down, especially early on when a single Condor is still a match for anything the aliens field.  Rather than letting the sites rot and taking a PR penalty with the nation where they crashed, Xenonauts provides the option to call an airstrike and saturate that area, then send a non-combatant cleanup team to salvage what it can.  This results in a static amount of cash based on the class of crashed craft, and a few recoverable items, but no soldier experience or personnel equipment captures.Soldier Management:  Enemy Unknown/Within introduced the concept of soldier classes; a Rookie, upon promotion to Squaddie, was assigned one of four classes.  That class distinction determined what stats increased when the soldier was promoted, what weapons the soldier was allowed to carry, and what special abilities became available to that soldier as rank increased.  It's a novel concept, but there are downsides.  Class assignment is for life, for one thing, and there's little room for creative misuse of inventory -- you can't load down an Assault trooper with grenades, for instance.  Nonlethal weapons were considered Items rather than weapons in EU/EW, as well, which meant that you had to choose between that and grenades, or extra armor, or whatever else.  It added importance to the range of choices, but only by limiting them. Xenonauts doesn't have classes, but it does allow you to assign a soldier a role.  The main differences are that any role can technically carry any equipment; there are customizable default equipment templates for each role; you can change a soldier's role in the barracks anytime the soldier is on base; and you can create new roles.  Weapon disparity is a little wider, and there is in fact a ""laser shotgun"" and other mechanics-only nonsense, but in general the strategic and tactical choices you can make in Xenonauts is far wider and more granular than in its ancestors.Tactical Combat:Oh, man.  Where to start.  Quick list of things that don't require explanation:- Stun rockets are a thing.  You get them as soon as you get stun grenades.- You don't have to wait half the game to get stun grenades.- Nonlethal melee weapons exist, and they're weapons -- not some other item class.- All soldiers carry an infinite number of flares!  (But vehicles don't.)- Vision arcs are back.  An unarmored human has a 90-degree effective vision arc.  (Heavy armor can reduce this.)- Cover is not a light switch like in EU/EW, but rather a stack of calculated obstruction percentages like in older X-COM titles.  Stuff that might require some more description:- Range matters a lot.  Different weapons are optimized either for long-range armor-piercing fire, or massive trauma at point-blank range.  You have to make sure you send the right soldier for the right tactical situation, all the time; the aliens are as merciless as they ever were in TFTD, and a soldier caught at a disadvantage is very probably toast.- Area denial is a real thing.  Enough shell-shock (automatic weapons fire, explosives, etc.) in the immediate vicinity of a soldier (human or enemy) can cause them to become Suppressed, which takes away their TU's (no reaction fire from that soldier), and reduces the TU's they get next turn by 50% (no burst fire, probably no grenades, just movement adjustments OR one decent shot).  Heavy weapons and vehicle weapons are wonderful for this, but remember ammo is being counted.- Reaction fire is not solely a function of the reacting soldiers' statistics -- reaction initiative is calculated using (get this) modifiers determined by the weapons and equipment worn by both the active and reactive soldiers, Reaction stats, and *TU's the reacting player has left*.  That doesn't just mean that low TU's result in snap shots; it means that high TU's can result in normal or snap shots, and low TU's can lead to the reactive soldier being unable to respond fast enough even though he technically has enough TU's to take a shot.  In addition, assault weapons actually inflict a reaction penalty on anyone calculating reaction fire against them; carrying a shotgun actually makes it much more likely that you'll get the first shot in a point-blank, room-to-room encounter.Summary:The mechanics of Xenonauts are closer to what I've always wanted X-COM to be.  I'm not in love with the tactical display's graphical quality, but if there's a sequel, I'll look for that to improve.  Meanwhile, the game is a beautiful example of this game type, and the creation and maintenance of it is behavior we enthusiasts should reward by burying the developers in enough money that they decide it would be crazy not to make another one.

												This is a pretty sweet game, killer soundtrack, great gameplay, spooky aliens, pages upon pages of lore in the xenopedia complete with a free novella recounting first contact. This is what I wish Enemy Unknown had been and I was never even one to be nostalgic of the originals mostly because I hadn't played them but to compare them side by side this, to me at lest, is simply a better strategy game. Each and every difficulty setting is a challenge even easy mode but then again I'm a dumb dumb, I couldn't really recommend it more I haven't found an aspect of it that pisses me off at all. The first time I took a look at the manually controlled air combat I said out loud ""Why did I click on this button? It was a guaranteed victory."" But I did not then understand that it was fantastic air combat not to mention that you'll be better off engaging a target manually if your percentage for victory is less then seventy because you can do what a computer cannot, fight for the survival of humanity with some gumption.Anyways it's got big women, big money and big fun. Scratch the big money though because it's only twenty-five bucks so hook yourself up with a sweet game.			"

												I really have enjoyed the short time I have put into this game. After one Ironman run where I ultimately have to restart, I couldn't be happier! The amount of depth and customization is really great! I enjoy a lot of things about this game, and as someone who got into the Xcom series a bit late.. I find the UI preferable to the classics and the title a good way to experience the old elements of the xcom series that didn't carry over to the newest release. A good game in it's own right, and a good route to go if you want something harder in the same genre as enemy unknown/within. A great spiritual successor to the older entires and brings back memories of old school TBS gaming.The few little problems I have run across are more than overlookable.I am quite glad to see where this game has gone, being hesitant at first to hop on it until more development was accomplished! I would say in it's current state it is a quality product, well worth the price tag!			"

												If you like X-Com, then you'll love Xenonauts. In my opinion, this game did everything that i wanted the new X-com to do and with some fancy new features stacked ontop. The ground combat is intense and satisfying, there's plenty of gear and technology for you to research and progress through and the game is hard as nails. Everything you could want if your looking for that nostalgic playthrough of the old X-Com games with a bit of a newer coat of paint. The only flaws that stand out to me is the user interface is a bit janky in places, alt-tabbing makes the game act wierd for a few seconds, and the graphical quality of the ground combat isn't the best, and in the later game you really aren't given enough funding, i feel like they should scale it in some way, in my playthrough i was on two bases, and i was doing fairly well for myself, making 2.9 million every month, but the maintinence costs of the bases shrunk that down to a mere 800 thousand a month. And i haven't even completed the game yet. Other then those flaws however, the game perfomes admirably and certainly deliveres that classic X-com experience.			"

												Okay, so this is not a review so much as the ravings of a rabid fan boy.  This game is amazing. If you even remotely liked X-Com:UD and were saddened by Firaxis's approach to the reboot, give this a try.  The art style is great, the writing in the UFOpedia is well done, and the battles have a nice variety of tactical options if you use all the toys at your disposal. It is for all intents and purposes a clone of the parent game, but it is lovingly done and has enough new things to keep this one in my library for a long time.			"

It is also set in the late 70's going into the 80's which adds a different feel to the game art as well. I find it be more kind of a refreshing reboot in a lot of ways and have enjoyed it even more since its official release.			"

												After playing the game for At least 10+ hours i can safely say that i got my moneys worth and that the game was a ton of fun.  Now that being said, the game has a lot of problems and I am not talking about bug's cuz i didn't see any while playing no what i talking about is the huge problem that is the boring ground combat. While at the beginning it's fun with time it becomes more of a chore and you wish the game had a auto resolve for that although you can airstrike but you team get's no xp and less money.   The problems i have noticed are as follows (personally) :   1. you can't rotate the camera thus navigating the terrain can be sometimes finicky  2. the utter lack of soldier customization. While you get a portrait and all in game every soldier looks the same so you feel no connection to your soldiers and you simply can't distinguish one from the other it takes the fun out of it,   Overall it's a fun game and if you never played the original xcom and want to know what the game is like without the outdated graphics then this game is for you			"

												This is one of the best turn based strategy games I have ever played. It is very well made; I have seen no glitchs or bugs, and the controls make miss-clicks a rare occurence. The difficulty scale is great as well. At the lower levels, it is more forgiving for new players yet still really fun. At the higher difficulties, it requires a high level of both stategic and tactical knowledge to survive, providing a very satisfiying challenge that I have not seen since Civ V.The only problems I have with the game is that it does not tell how long some things may take to do, like researching tech and hiring new personel. This is a minor issue however, because after several playthroughs you have a general idea of how long these things may take to do.Overall, Xenonauts is a great strategy game (9 of 10) and is well worth playing.

												I can't say how close this is to the original XCOM game because i haven't played it, but I did play Enemy Unknown. While Enemy Unknown is a great game. I enjoy Xenonauts a whole lot more compared to Enemy Unknown, simply because it is a lot more complex and requires more thought. Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of turn based games and especially those who played Enemy Unknown but were left wanting something more challenging and complex.Another thing worth mentioning is that the game is very moddable and according to the developers the game will get Workshop support in the near future so things can only go up from here.

												I've only played about 15 hours of this so far, and I can safely say that this is, quite simply, one of the best turn based strategy games I've ever played. It's complicated, it's both epic in scope and self contained at the same time, and best of all, it expects you to just man up and deal with it when things go wrong.Essentially, its a straight remake of the 1990's original X-COM: UFO Defence (Or UFO: Enemy Unknown as it was known over here), but with the setting transposed and a few extra features added, such as the ability to airstrike crashes you don't want clear personally, which gets you money and saves time, but you don't get many resources or much soldier experience from it. Also added is a completely new interception system. Once your planes get in range you can direct them as they fly about in the air, until eventually they run out of fuel, ammunition, or everything crashes. It's all pretty awesome.The best part of it though is undoubtedly the vehicles. Unlike the recent XCOM: Enemy Unknown,  your transports can fit a small vehicle such as an armoured car into their loading bay instead of two soldiers. Once researched and built, these give your forces an undeniable edge as they suppress, expose or just otherwise blow the hell out of most of the enemies you encounter, with the tradeoff of limited ammunition and easily destroyed armour at close range.The only downsides I can really think of are a) the map shortage, although apparently there's a downloadable map pack that adds a load of new ones. It hasn't bothered me too much, but it's noticeable and b) you can't turn the camera, so occasionally the isometric veiwpoint obscures things a tad. But these are only minor things.Just get the damn thing already.			"

												Xenonauts . . . I'm not one who usually supports this new-fangled ""early access"" gaming craze. Usually. Xenonauts is one of my few exceptions. It's exactly what it claims to be - A complete remake of the original UFO: Enemy Unknown, but with a unique Cold War motif, different aliens, vastly improved graphics (compared to a game from 1994, that's to be expected) and an array of new features and tweaks that make the whole experience feel better and play far more smoothly. What it isn't is a streamlined reboot, ala Firaxis' recent XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within. For better and for worse, this is far more faithful to the original game (read: it's a lot harder to win, and learn how to play the game initially). That's what I wanted, and that's what I got. I couldn't be more pleased, and if this is what you're looking for, then I highly recommend that you stop reading and pick this game up IMMEDIATELY. That said, there are a few things keeping this from being 100% perfect. First, the game just needs a bit more . . . pizazz, for lack of a better word. It lacks an animated intro, a big missing feature compared to either the original UFO or the more recent XCOM. I know most wouldn't consider this a critical thing, but there was always something to booting up UFO and watching the Rob Liefield soldiers jump around firing mini-guns at fist shaking mutons that put you in the mood to do the same on the battlescape, and it's sorely missed when booting up Xenonauts. Obviously something fitting the darker style of 'Nauts would be needed rather than that silliness, but jumping straight into the title menu from the launcher just feels a bit jarring. Plus, one thing the new XCOM definitely nailed was giving the soldiers a lot of personality via little quips and callouts - considering this is a text focused game, it seems like a relatively simple thing that could have been/be added to make battles have just that extra little bit of character that would keep this up with Firaxis' bigger budget reboot. Additionally, this game could really use a tutorial mission or two for first-time players. While these players are obviously not the target demographic (that's fans of the original UFO like myself), the fact that there's nothing makes the transition from UFO neophyte to veteran that much harder. It makes it a bit tougher to recommend to anyone unfamiliar with at least turn-based tactics games and UFO/XCOM in particular. For those in this group that are tempted by the game, I still think you should give this game a shot, just know that you're going to have to have more patience to learn how to play this game than most. After that though, this game is pretty much perfect as far as having an endlessly replayable Military versus Aliens Tactics and Strategy game. Enjoy, and keep watching those skies fellow Xenonauts!

												Holy crap, this game, smells and looks like the original X-com, but it looks like the original X-com we remember playing with our rose tinted glasses of the past, in laymans terms, that means that the original game didn't look as good as this, but  we'd like to think it did. Couple this with mod support and the outstanding community edition that is available through steam, and this game is a winner winner, chicken dinner. You can play through this game however you want to, do you brink a vehicle or two extra xeonauts? do you bring heavy or light guns? just grenades? pretty much any strategy works on the battlefield if your patient enough to make it work. most games these days hold your hand, this one will help you at the start but just like a parent teaching their child to ride a bike you'll soon notice those hands on your back are gone, how long have they been gone? you don't know because this game is easy to learn, but very hard to master.There will be times when this game will make you want to rage quit, thats normal, thats called building a connection with your troops and then some alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his plasma power sniper rifle gets a lucky shot and blow out their head/chest cavity with a bolt of plasma, thats what happens when your going up against superior tech. Your only way to win is to get tactical.Although iron man mode isn't the only way to play this game, its singleplayer you play however you want to play, want to load a save game everytime something goes wrong? you can do, its called learning. my first playthrough was somewhat like that, i took my fair share of losses, and even with repeated reloading, the game was still very challenging. My second playthrough is shaping up to be a much tougher, and rougher challenge without the reloading. And if i can justify giving this game another run through you can justify playing it if you have any love of tactical games. ( especially if it is on sale like it is right now!)			"

												This game is not fair.Let's get that out of the way right off the bat. If you're looking for something you can play well and have no chance of failing horribly, this is not it. One bad mission, one stroke of bad luck, can send you spinning down the path to destruction.However, there are a great many selling points that keep me coming back to this game; while it isn't fair, if you accept that you will have a good time. This game forces you to think. There will be many times when you will think, ""oh, there's probably no aliens there; I can afford to rush or leave it unguarded"". Well, if you think that, stop yourself. Mistakes are not dealt with lightly in this game, and rushing is not a luxury you can often take.  Likewise, always have a contingency plan for when you miss. No - scratch that- have three. Because if you leave your team in the hands of someone with a shotgun, and that Andron manages to survive those shots, you just lost a valuable team member, if not two. Leave enough time for your rifleman to pop around the corner and finish him off, or else you will cry. Remember - 70% chance to hit is just an optimistic way to say 30% chance to miss. This game does not like impatience.But it's just so *satisfying*! Blowing your first corvette out of the sky, capturing that first xeno, and clearing out every last alien crash site feels great. And you get the satisfaction of knowing you did it right. Plus this game has all of the options you can possibly want in terms of ground battles. It all works just as you'd expect, and the customization in loadouts along with the options you have in ground battles in terms of strategy makes the game very compelling, and keeps me coming back every time I get frustrated. In the end, no, it's not fair, but there's always something you can do to even the odds, and it all depends on just how much time you're willing to take.			"

You mannage a base of soldiers, engineres and scientists to combat an alien invasion by shooting down aircraft and fighting aliens that land on earth. The biggest focus of the game is the ground based, turn based stategy combat.Game is very hard and not very friendly for new players with UI elements needing to be clearer for inexperienced players.But game is fair(ish), very rewarding when you get the hang of it and the atmosphere it creates is incredible.It's a game designed in the 90s: don't expect it to hold your hand, expect aliens to beat your♥♥♥♥♥			"

								Mostly like the original X-Com, or at least it manages to come closer than any of the other attempts to re-create it. Most if not all of the new features and quality of life improvements are going to anger the grognards (""WTF!!!! destroyed interceptors are replaced automatically!?!? I have infinte flares?! what is this babies first strategy game?!?"") but for people not living in a magical fantasy land where in all the good games stopped being made around 1994 these improvements will be welcome. I still like EU/EW and the original X-Com better, but this is still good.			"

												One of the most enjoyable Games i have played in a while. Really brings back the feeling of the old xcom while still adding fresh ideas such as upgraded air combat and it looks a hell of a lot nicer.			"

												A very good spiritual successor to the original xcom. This game is not for the faint of heart, it's actually quite difficult.And even if you succesfully navigate the missions, you may still lose the game if you haven't built up enough bases covering enough of the world to maintain your relationships with the various countries high enough that they'll keep funding you. If enough territories leave the alliance, you'll lose the game outright.  "

								Is this the closest to the original? YES.Is this a clone of the original? NO.Is this better than the original\better than the other titles? YOU JUDGE.Is the difficulty tuned for monkeys? NO. Your men and women will die. A lot. As they should.Is it moddable? HELL YEAH. (see below)Is it the perfect xcom? SHUT UP and don't bother me with silly questions.I strongly suggest you take a look at the modding community of Xenonauts. The developers made a really good and professional work, but as often happens modders can make you cry with joy and bow in awe.As of now, 21 of May 2014, you can find their creations at: http://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/forumdisplay.php/10-Xenonauts-ModdingAn example of mods I'll personally install for my first playthrough:- Jsleezy's Real Fighter Portrait Pack: http://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/showthread.php/7357-Jsleezy-s-Real-Fighter-Portrait-Pack- Skitso's Oppressive UI MOD: http://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/showthread.php/8573-Skitso-s-Oppressive-UI-MOD- Jsleezy's Real Armors Mod: http://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/showthread.php/6662-Jsleezy-s-Real-Armors- Skitso's Femonauts: http://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/showthread.php/10080-Skitso-s-FemonautsThese are just a few examples, feel free to check the forum or whatever other place the mods will migrate to yourself.Have fun.

												I am not going to review the mechanics of this game. There are far better game reviews out there for this. Instead this couple of paragraphs are mostly for those of you that are on the fence about purchasing this game. I purchased this game right before it came out of beta but I would have happly bought it even at its full price. The original X-Com: UFO Defense (1994 MicroProse) was a truly remarkable game and but for the graphics stands up well to games released today. Xenonauts recreates the original game (with a few extra suprises) very well. The developers have updated the graphics and improved the AI. The game is challanging even on the average setting. I have yet to try the higher settings. If you have never played the original X-Com, this game is a must. If you have played X-Com, you owe it to yourself to get this game. It will bring back memories of sitting in front of your computer for hours on end trying to destroy the alien base and save the world.So, if you are on the fence, don't be. Click the buy button. If you enjoy turn based squad action, you are going to love this game.			"

												Amazing x-com remake. If your a big fan of the original x-com you'll love this game. Don't expect anything new, its just a clone, but its extremely well done. Everything you want is there, things you wish were in x-com. For example it shows % chance to hit, travel path, etc. The graphics are very well drawn, and 2D as it should be. The writing and story are fantastic. Effort was obviously put in to make it as strategic as possible.On the down side it has a few bugs. Nothing game breaking but defiantly annoying. It has not crashed even once on me in 50 hours of play. Mostly minor issue such as if you have a unit behind a building, the building will become translucent so you can see your unit, but then when you swap to a different unit, its still translucent even though you might want to fly onto that buildings roof. You just have to eyeball where the room might be, and once he gets there it will reappear for you.			"

												I  only have a few hours of gameplay under my belt at this point, but at this moment I am willing to call this game incredible!  I have played and liked the Xcom remake, Silent Storm, and some of the UFO series; I consider this game to be a peer of that group, and it has qualities that make it extraordinary in it's own right.  I was worried about the graphics, if it would present barriers to imersion.  They didn't.I was worried it would be simple, a series of milk-runs.  It is not.  It presented a deep tatical chalange that I am still not equal to.  I remember the first mission where no one died.  That left me with a good feeling and a real sense of achivment.Note: I sometimes need to open Task Manager after launching the game, and end the application, if the launcher does open.  Upon retrying, the game launches without issue, and I have had no crashes.   This bug does not affect my enjoyment of the game, it is an inconvience, nothing more.			"

												A great time buster. You will be playing past midnight trying to gun down the last alien.You play the role as the base operations commander as you try and save earth from an alien invasion. It's up to you to manage resources, teams and money for maximum efficiency.This is a great turn base game and also real time. If you love xcom or any turn base type games this is the one not to miss.There are a few glitches but the dev team has been doing a great job patching. After all this is an indie game you have to give them lots of love for their time. "

												Xenonauts is a distillation of the X-COM formula to challenge veterans looking for something a little more down-to-earth than Firaxis's XCOM: Enemy Unknown.Success comes in a different package that may not be obvious to UFO Defense alumni. Veterans would think to fill their warchests by raiding landed Supply Ships and mass-producing Laser Cannons. In the Cold War, however, it's up to the funding nations to supply you - you're fighting against both time and budget constraints as you rush to research and manufacture enough new technology to have some hope of staying ahead of the alien invasion, all while keeping your neighbors happy.Ensuring the funding nations remain impressed and satisfied means spending time and resources on the Geoscape and the air game - radar coverage and interceptors. Shooting down UFOs pleases those who pay your bills; failure to effectively react to the disaster tickers is undesirable, the casualty gauge looming overhead as an ever-present reminder of the Xenonauts' reponsibilities.This also acts as something of a de-emphasis on the Battlescape: while you will want to check out new UFOs to add research options, raiding every crash site in every wave will inevitably feel grindy and the monetary rewards would take months to make a difference in the long run. Sending your top dudes to earn a few extra bucks will inevitably backfire when you lose your ace Sniper, forcing you to spend a hundred grand and two weeks to recruit her replacement and manufacture a new weapon and armor. It's much safer to sell the site to the locals, still paying for half a new Plasma Rifle while letting someone else do the dirty work, saving your vets for the new type of UFO due to appear next week.In closing, this is *the* X-COM clone we've been waiting years for. Many games have treid to replicate the formula but Xenonauts has gotten it right like no other.			"

												This game is a quality revitalization of the original X-COM.  It not only met the high standards set by the 90s classic but also exceeded the benchmark in many ways.  - This is a global war fought by many nations that join in the fight.  Militaries around the world as well as farmers with shotguns will aid the multi-national force in its fight against the alien invasion.  Occassionally they bring down alien crafts (at terrible losses),   Allied units are represented as cops on the street, farmers blasting aliens on the other side of the farm as your troops hunt aliens around haystacks, or national militaries desperately defending the city during terror missions  - Interception missions are extremely fun - take personal control of your interceptors to bait and flank enemy crafts once your squadron catches up to an enemy flight (it could be a battleshield escorted by two fighters, or just a lone scout) - this minigame is many times more fun than X-COM's interception mission.  - Your soldiers earn medals for performing extraordinary tasks - the medals in turn boost their stats- Many weapons to choose from - riot shields (wield one with a pistol), shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, RPGs, HMGs, researched alien technologies, even a TANK that will eventually look like a real tank (upon further research).  Who doesn't want to use a tank to blow away aliens?  In X-COM games, the tank is always a tiny robo-craft that look gimpy... here we have a real tank!  - Addressed many short-comings in the original X-COM game.  You can now fly the troop transport to multiple crash sites, direct interceptors to target one group of enemy after another (assuming enough ammo and fuel left).  - It is a challenging but highly rewarding game.  It is fair (none of that enemy ""spawning"" behavior in X-COM Enemy Unknown), but it is tough.  I would rather have a tough game that is fair than an easy game with funky game logics. I am an avid X-COM player: 5 playthroughs in the original X-COM, 1 playthrough of TFTD (ok that was torture), 1 playthrough for Apocalypse, 1 playthrough in X-COM EU.  I am proud to say that Xenonaut has won me over as the quality spiritual successor that I have always been looking for.			"

Buggy Iron Man mode (Occurs when you Alt+F4 out of IronMan during Alien's Turn)5. Graphic bugs (Fixed)6. Saving gets corrupt and unplayable. (Hasn't occured since the latest patches)7.

												I actually deleted my first review of this game, in light of my opinion on it changing considerably.Do I recommend the game, still? Mildly, yes. Do I like it? Yeah! Do I LOVE it? No, no I do not.I bought this game mostly because X-Com Classic is incredibly old and boy oh boy did I not want to have to deal with that god forsaken UI, yet at the same time, I wanted to see what was missing from XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within. So, I bought this game.The game developers seem to have made numerous changes to the game, from X-Com. They are all based on good intentions, but... well, you know what they say about good intentions. For one, the developers removed weapons like Blaster Launchers. While that's all well and good, the developers also decided to cut Psychic Powers entirely out of the game. It sounded like a good idea, at first (Mind Control was pretty broken, come on, guys), it seriously neuters the game's variety. As the game progresses, missions start to feel the same, and some of them drag on way too long. After a few months into the campaign, save for some new alien species appearing, there was very little difference in overall gameplay. And because the missions are so dry and repetitive, it quickly starts to feel like a damn grind. Now, one could say the missions in XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within were also repetitive -- and I won't lie to you, they became rather tiresome (especially in the lackluster endgame). But Enemy Unknown had many mechanics that made it enjoyable, most importantly the perks that each soldier got. Yeah it may not be realistic but honestly I would much rather have perks, than have every single soldier be completely interchangeable -- and that's what it's like in Xenonauts. Every soldier is basically the same. Every mission is the same. Without things like perks and abilities, combat gets boring FAST. Oh, and you don't profit from selling alien items, like you did in X-com. Again, balance issues and good intentions. But the economy in this game is already quite stressful. Oh, and also, not being able to make a profit selling weapons capable of hurting aliens to a world that is in desperate need of them makes NO GOD DAMN SENSE! So how do you make money? You grind your balls off raiding every UFO that touches Terran dirt, which is what makes the combat gameplay grow stale!Man, you know, thinking about it -- I honestly have no idea if I can recommend this game. It's pretty moddable, but even mods only do so much. The combat is kind of nice, though. Reminds me of Fallout.I give it a cautious and confused recommendation, because despite its flaws, I can't bring myself to hate the game. Also, many of the game's features can literally be tinkered with simply by opening the .xml files in OpenOffice or something -- which I personally did to end that profit nonsense mentioned above.

												Summary: High-quality clone of the original X-Com: Enemy Unknown (1994).Positive: Its X-Com with modern features draped in a nice Cold War setting. The geoscape and battlescape are here with almost nothing left out (see below). The writing is actually a standout, reading the research reports was a small joy. Everything is presented in a way that is plausible in a late '70s timeline. The conclusions the science teams come away with are believable works of good fiction. I would love to provide an excerpt for your enjoyment here, but its too good to potentially spoil anything. There is also a bit of humor with a minor rivalry between the science and engineering departments. Speaking of research, as the game progresses and the Xenonaut program continues it's scientific advance, the graphics of your base screens update with the newfound technology; its a nice touch. Non-Xenonaut friendly forces also gain some of the technology you discover over time; neat! The game is also moddable. Negative: A few bugs: nothing too major, but there was one glitch that locked the game. This error only happend once over a 50+ hour campaign. There are some graphical errors when minimizing the game. Further visual glitches when aliens throw grenades; sometimes doubling in size until the animation completes, or appearing to throw twice in succession. There is a type of combat that doesn't involve traditional weaponry that is notablely missing from the game. The aliens still have it, but unlike every other X-Com clone the human forces simply cannot gain it... ever. Personally, I would have preferred for this type of combat to be rebalanced rather than removed from the game. There are only two ways to fight back against this ""weapon"" and neither one is reliable. There are very few maps in the battlescape. You'll end up on the same slightly-altered variations endlessly. There is a popular mod that fixes this. The infamous ""95%-chance-to-hit-but-still-somehow-misses"" RNG is still alive and well here. The aliens also get to throw grenades in some situations in which you cannot (""100% block""). Smoke Grenages are heavily nerfed, almost to the point of being useless. They were too powerful in the original for sure, but here they only last three turns (at best) and only work against a few types of aliens.The geoscape UFO activity happens all at once instead of being spaced out. Basically, the aliens coordinate one big ""assault-of-the-week"" every few days without variation. It would have been better to keep the old style of individual missions rather than this approach; it feels too synthetic.Overall: 8/10, I can't remember the last time a game has kept me playing in one sitting as long as this one. I felt like a kid again playing this wonderful game. Great job developers! With mods this is a nine out of ten game.			"

												Bought this game a while ago and thought it was time to write a review.If you love the old UFO/XCOM games (the MSDOS ones from Microsoft) you will love this game. It is VERY similar comapred to those classics, with of course imrpoved graphics and gameplay.Everything you loved in the old games is here..and more....or better,sometimes both.The intercepting of an ufo for example. Now you can control andgive directions to your fighters,where to fly,to evade,afterburner etc. Its possible to shoot down a large UFO, by using inferiour/outdated crafts and weapons, by just apllying a good strategy. Some UFOS have escort crafts, some ufos need rockets(torpedos) to make them land. There are alot of options.The actual isometric ground combat is much harder than in the old Xcoms. The aliens are more deadly and smarter than the Mircoprose ones. It requires care and patience to surivive the first missions without casualties. In general, the learning curve for thsi game is steeper in every aspect. The financial part is very challening. To keep your bases running and build new fighters and weapons or armor is costly. Even the base locations took me several starts to really get a cost efficient coverage of the globe. Of course all the other game aspects from the classics are here. Base construction, research, building items, improving your squad etc are all here...but as i mentiond just better polished.I played the early 2000 UFO games,which were realtime and hated them. I played the 2k Xcom and never really liked it. It looks flashy, but the gameplay is just boring and stale. It does not feel grand and very limited.Xenonauts gives me all the freedom i want ...and it makes me pay for it, if i make poor decisions....but i love it. "

												Overall a solid experience. The only thing that annoyed me was some questionable mechanics in the ground combat mode. Ex* No melee weapons except the stun baton?* Experienced solders going berserk without any apparent reason killing your squad with a bazooka or other weapon of choice. And apparently when berserk they have hugely increased accuracy?* Soldiers missing shots at point blank range (95% hit)* Soldiers that cant throw grenades over flowers/bushes killing them self in the process (same with bazookas).* Reaction shoots works poorly. Quite often your soldiers never takes reaction shots even if an alien is running around in front of them. I solved this by doing 2 saves each turn (At the beginning and at the end of each turn) and reloading if any of the soldiers messed up. Would be fun to know how many times I did a quicksave but i'm sure its 2000+ times. 7/10			"

												With a very retro feel, this game captures the degrees of intricacy and micomanagement that Firaxis didn't with their IP reboot of XCOM. The ability to tactically place troops, installations and worry about security, radar coverage and individual loadouts adds a dimension to this game that is really a callback to the core gameplay of the older UFO games. Overall, a fun play for those of you who enjoy a retro spin on things.			"

												One of my men panicked and shot my machine gunner so next turn my rifleman promptly turned around and shot him. I don't have time for cowards in my xco... errr xenonauts.----see proper review below----This game... IS FANTASTIC! I own all x-coms thanks to a wonderful Steam sale (PRAISE LORD GABEN) and after playing openxcom (it's a mod that overhauls the 1993 xcom) for over 600 hours I can clearly say THIS is the proper sequel to that game. Basically it's a pretty remake of the original xcom ufo defense from 1993. No fancy voice acting, no 3d graphics, nothing shiny. Xenonauts takes place in the 1970's at the height of the cold war so the world is ready to blow itself up four times over so yes I love how the graphics are dry and bleak and bland because it makes the player feel this constant tension even when your at the base. The lore is fantastic. Autoposies no longer take days but your scientists automatically do them and give you a report you have to READ! *gasp* Yes read. Like I said before there's no lady screaming at you ""COMMANDER TO THE RESEARCH LABS"" anymore. It's just you, errie music, and your silent soldiers who are willing to die at a moments notice if their commander orders them to.Action points are back! YESSSS! If you don't like manually checking your corners and you think your soldiers should have vision 360 degrees around them at all times then you won't like the fact that when clearing a room you have to turn left, turn right, turn forward, and clear the room step by step by step. It's much slower than firaxis's xcom and i like xenonauts much more because of it.And vehicles that actually do stuff! SHIV's? Pfft. How bout a small tank?And mods! MODS MODS MODS MODS MODS! There's not many out there as of right now but the ones that are out there are FANTASTIC such as Fire in the Hole which makes UFO's breachable in certain spots so if the front door isn't an option make you own door.In short the new xcom's are just toooo dumbed down for me and xenonauts gives me the ""pre♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; feeling on missions that the original xcom did. Maybe not to the point of where your walking around with your hands on your butt, but it's still that ol familiar ""should I go check that corner of the map even though its really small but an alien could be waiting to shoot my guy in the back if i don't go check it damn it there's an alien there wtf am i gonna do now"" feeling.

												An excellent, faithful resurrection of the classic X-Com gameplay.  Nice, clear, crisp graphics where objects stand out against the background.  Great gameplay with actual strategic depth.  A full game at a fair price (no awful DLC or extra purchases required to enjoy the complete game).  I can't say much negative about this true gem of a game.  My only criticism is that the models for your actual troops are all the same...regardless of race or gender, each soldier looks like a white guy.  Some customization options for individual troops (even color coding uniforms) would have been appreciated, and their absence seems weird in a game with so much detail and so many features.  Still, this is an awesome game.			"

Early Access Review
								Is this the closest to the original? YES.Is this a clone of the original? NO.Is this better than the original\better than the other titles? YOU JUDGE.Is the difficulty tuned for monkeys? NO. Your men and women will die. A lot. As they should.Is it moddable? HELL YEAH. (see below)Is it the perfect xcom? SHUT UP and don't bother me with silly questions.I strongly suggest you take a look at the modding community of Xenonauts. The developers made a really good and professional work, but as often happens modders can make you cry with joy and bow in awe.As of now, 21 of May 2014, you can find their creations at: http://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/forumdisplay.php/10-Xenonauts-ModdingAn example of mods I'll personally install for my first playthrough:- Jsleezy's Real Fighter Portrait Pack: http://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/showthread.php/7357-Jsleezy-s-Real-Fighter-Portrait-Pack- Skitso's Oppressive UI MOD: http://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/showthread.php/8573-Skitso-s-Oppressive-UI-MOD- Jsleezy's Real Armors Mod: http://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/showthread.php/6662-Jsleezy-s-Real-Armors- Skitso's Femonauts: http://www.goldhawkinteractive.com/forums/showthread.php/10080-Skitso-s-FemonautsThese are just a few examples, feel free to check the forum or whatever other place the mods will migrate to yourself.Have fun.

												This isn't a bad game. It comes very close to the feel of the original X-Com games. However it does have a few bugs that can make gameplay annoying at times. The worst is line of sight. Sometimes enemies behave like they can see thru walls and floors and shoot right through them like they aren't even there. Otherwise the game is fun to play.			"

												Xenonauts is easily the best Turn Based Tactics/Strategy game I've played in long time. I did not play the original XCOM or even the other spinoffs, so this review won't help you if you're looking at it from that perspective.We'll start with the core of the game, combat. Send your elite commandos all over the world to accomplish many different objectives. The combat is turned based, so you have plenty of time to think about your strategy, which is really important because around every corner, you're soldiers could meet their death. The better armed and usually physically stronger alien invaders have a clear advantage. If you're careless, you're dead. Customize your soldiers with gear/weapons to suite the role you want them to play and to suite your tactical preference, but watch out....when they're dead their dead for good along with all the expensive gear you may have equipped them with. You'll face many different types of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. You'll need to adjust you tactics nearly every mission, depending on what you're facing and what area of the world you're in Urban/Rural/Desert/Arctic. The maps can get a little repetitive, apparently there are not that many, but there are plenty of map mods available or you can make your own.The second part of the game is managing your military, as a whole.  You begin the game facing an enemy who has a clear technological advantage, but thorugh research you can implement Alien technology for your own purposes, but it's expensive and time consuming, so chose wisly. Playing the game on normal, you'll always feel one step behind the aliens as they ramp up their invasion. You'l need to build bases to protect the nations of the world, who are funding you! Let too many aliens thorugh, an you'll lose the nation, loose too many nations game over man.I have about 40 hours in so far and I can highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys thinking tactically or strategically. It's a fun game you can play for 30 minutes at a time or settle in for a good 6 hour marathon. The combat can get a little repretive in the beginning, but as the game progresses I actually started to notice it less. I also downloaded some map mods too.I would give it 4 out of 5 and a must have for lovers of strategy. "

												TL;DR = It can be good, even great at times. It can also be horribly frustrating and feels exceptioannly dated for a recent release. For genre veterans its certainly worth a playthrough, but nascent players are better off starting with the recent XCom: EW, Wasteland 2, or Shadowrun: Dragonfall. 7.5/10 Xenonauts follows in the tradition of the original XCom, which focuses on tactical turn-based gameplay coupled with an over-arching strategic layer involving the establishment and maintainence of multiple bases. The strategic portion includes the recruitment of new soldiers, dubbed ""xenonauts"", as well as the research and production of myriad new technologies. This tech ranges from new weapons and equipment for your xenonauts to new vehicles and enhanced base defenses to help ward off attacks from the alien invaders. The tactical portion is a turn-based affair that utilizes time units (or ""TUs"") that are used for every action your xenonauts undertake, from movement and reloading to crouching and the use of weapons and medkits. The graphics on display are fairly archaic, and would not have been out-of-place in a mid 90s PC release. While servicable, they are nothing to write home about. The sound has a similar presentation, possessing a distorted quality that lies somewhere between the NES and SNES in terms of depth and range. The gameplay itself is a mixed bag of engaging tactics and uneven difficulty spikes. Each of your xenonauts has a sight cone that allows only the portion of the screen being directly looked at to be uncovered. The rest is shrouded in a shaded fog-of-war where aliens can lurk and undertake actions without being noticed by nearby xenonauts. This sight cone is excpetionally small, and can lead to many instances of ""cheap"" deaths wherein an alien attacker has clear line of sight on your xenonauts whereas your soldiers cannot see them, despite looking specifically in the direction of the attacker. There are also Chrysallid-type enemies that should be familiar to any veteran XCom player, which will routinely charge from behind the fog-of-war and one-hit kill the closest xenonaut. The type of armor equipped has no bearing on this, as even the top-tier provides absolutely zero protection against one-hit kills from this particular enemy type. The turn-by-turn gameplay is hampered by this and the uneven execution in the RNG (random number generator) system, leading to a ""turtling"" strategy as the most viable option available to players. Oftentimes your xenonauts will miss the majority of shots during a turn, whereas the aliens appear to benefit from not only increased range, sight, and damage dealt, but also a higher hit incidence. This leads to an understandable level of frustration as the deck feels stacked against you in many encounters, leading to the tried-and-true turtling strategy previously referenced. Players who felt at home with the recent XCom:EW release will likely find the systems used in Xenonauts a bit tedious and challenging in all the wrong ways.Despite these shortfalls, I still recommend Xenonauts to players who enjoyed the XCom series, or other genre staples such as Wasteland and Shadowrun. I would certainly recommend Wasteland 2, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, or XCom: EW over Xenonauts to nascent players of turn-based tactical games due to the latter's steep learning curve and decidedly old-school ambience, mechanics, and presentation. Xenonauts, however, is definitely worth a look for others who have already played those other aforementioned titles and are still looking to scratch their tactical gameplay itch. The strategic layer is deep and engrossing, and the tactical gameplay can be engaging and rewarding when running at its best. Just be aware that the gameplay systems on display feel fairly dated and battles can be tedious affairs that sometimes feel ""cheap"", but in the end the game as a whole can feel rewarding and become deeply addictive in the way that only the best turn-based strategy games can. Score: 7.5Recommended? YES, with reservations			"

												THIS was the X-COM 'sequel' I was hoping for.  I absolutely love this game.I love the 70/80's style graphics.  It really adds a nice feel to the game.  They are finely detailed, not intentionally dated as seems to be the trend with indie games now a days.  And anyone who has tried modding the unit graphics knows what sort of attention was put into these!That brings me to my favorite thing about this:  Modding!  Man, you can change virtually anything and everything in the game if you know where to look.  Add entire tiers of weapons or armor, including their 'pedia pages.  Change the stats on weapons, how your guys level up, you name it!  I even created a dart gun mod that is currently over on their official webpage.I think the biggest con, if I had to pick one, is that it is done in the Diner Dash engine.  This apparently severely limited what the developer could do with it.  But even with that limitation, Chris still came through with an absolutely stunning game.If you like the old X-COM games, You should enjoy this.  It is well worth the money, I promise!			"

This game takes what UFO Defense failed at and fixes it. The UI and graphics are gorgeous, and you have so much more freedom with what you do than in XCOM:EU. 9/11 would conduct terror missions again.			"

												After playing the game for At least 10+ hours i can safely say that i got my moneys worth and that the game was a ton of fun.  Now that being said, the game has a lot of problems and I am not talking about bug's cuz i didn't see any while playing no what i talking about is the huge problem that is the boring ground combat. While at the beginning it's fun with time it becomes more of a chore and you wish the game had a auto resolve for that although you can airstrike but you team get's no xp and less money.   The problems i have noticed are as follows (personally) :   1. you can't rotate the camera thus navigating the terrain can be sometimes finicky  2. the utter lack of soldier customization. While you get a portrait and all in game every soldier looks the same so you feel no connection to your soldiers and you simply can't distinguish one from the other it takes the fun out of it,   Overall it's a fun game and if you never played the original xcom and want to know what the game is like without the outdated graphics then this game is for you			"

												I've only played about 15 hours of this so far, and I can safely say that this is, quite simply, one of the best turn based strategy games I've ever played. It's complicated, it's both epic in scope and self contained at the same time, and best of all, it expects you to just man up and deal with it when things go wrong.Essentially, its a straight remake of the 1990's original X-COM: UFO Defence (Or UFO: Enemy Unknown as it was known over here), but with the setting transposed and a few extra features added, such as the ability to airstrike crashes you don't want clear personally, which gets you money and saves time, but you don't get many resources or much soldier experience from it. Also added is a completely new interception system. Once your planes get in range you can direct them as they fly about in the air, until eventually they run out of fuel, ammunition, or everything crashes. It's all pretty awesome.The best part of it though is undoubtedly the vehicles. Unlike the recent XCOM: Enemy Unknown,  your transports can fit a small vehicle such as an armoured car into their loading bay instead of two soldiers. Once researched and built, these give your forces an undeniable edge as they suppress, expose or just otherwise blow the hell out of most of the enemies you encounter, with the tradeoff of limited ammunition and easily destroyed armour at close range.The only downsides I can really think of are a) the map shortage, although apparently there's a downloadable map pack that adds a load of new ones. It hasn't bothered me too much, but it's noticeable and b) you can't turn the camera, so occasionally the isometric veiwpoint obscures things a tad. But these are only minor things.Just get the damn thing already.			"

												Xenonauts . . . I'm not one who usually supports this new-fangled ""early access"" gaming craze. Usually. Xenonauts is one of my few exceptions. It's exactly what it claims to be - A complete remake of the original UFO: Enemy Unknown, but with a unique Cold War motif, different aliens, vastly improved graphics (compared to a game from 1994, that's to be expected) and an array of new features and tweaks that make the whole experience feel better and play far more smoothly. What it isn't is a streamlined reboot, ala Firaxis' recent XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within. For better and for worse, this is far more faithful to the original game (read: it's a lot harder to win, and learn how to play the game initially). That's what I wanted, and that's what I got. I couldn't be more pleased, and if this is what you're looking for, then I highly recommend that you stop reading and pick this game up IMMEDIATELY. That said, there are a few things keeping this from being 100% perfect. First, the game just needs a bit more . . . pizazz, for lack of a better word. It lacks an animated intro, a big missing feature compared to either the original UFO or the more recent XCOM. I know most wouldn't consider this a critical thing, but there was always something to booting up UFO and watching the Rob Liefield soldiers jump around firing mini-guns at fist shaking mutons that put you in the mood to do the same on the battlescape, and it's sorely missed when booting up Xenonauts. Obviously something fitting the darker style of 'Nauts would be needed rather than that silliness, but jumping straight into the title menu from the launcher just feels a bit jarring. Plus, one thing the new XCOM definitely nailed was giving the soldiers a lot of personality via little quips and callouts - considering this is a text focused game, it seems like a relatively simple thing that could have been/be added to make battles have just that extra little bit of character that would keep this up with Firaxis' bigger budget reboot. Additionally, this game could really use a tutorial mission or two for first-time players. While these players are obviously not the target demographic (that's fans of the original UFO like myself), the fact that there's nothing makes the transition from UFO neophyte to veteran that much harder. It makes it a bit tougher to recommend to anyone unfamiliar with at least turn-based tactics games and UFO/XCOM in particular. For those in this group that are tempted by the game, I still think you should give this game a shot, just know that you're going to have to have more patience to learn how to play this game than most. After that though, this game is pretty much perfect as far as having an endlessly replayable Military versus Aliens Tactics and Strategy game. Enjoy, and keep watching those skies fellow Xenonauts!

The added features such as air-combat really make the game epic. The AI has been written to perfection, no longer are the aliens half asleep dozing about. However a small improvement to suggest would be to tweak the reaction firering mechanics as currently it feels like saving TUs for it is a bit pointless			"

												A remake of the original TBS classic X-Com:UFO Defence from the 90s.If you played any of the original Microprose X-Coms and were disappointed with the Firaxis reboot's lack of depth, then Xenonauts will not disappoint.It plays very similar to the original X-COM with some extra polish as you'd expect 20 years later.My favourite aspect is that the game has been opened up to the modding community, and there are some great mods out there that vastly expand the tech trees, maps, equipment etc etc.If you aren't familiar with the original, the game is split into a strategy layer, where you intercept UFOs, build up your bases, equip your troops and aircraft, do research etc, and a turn-based squad combat layer where you investigate crashed and landed UFOs, alien bases, terror sites etc.You never have enough money to do everything you want, and the difficulty ramps up as the invasion progresses. The graphics may seem a bit antiquated, but it's all about the gameplay, and rolling out your strategy for defeating the alien invasion.The ambient music is excellent, and the hours fly by as you get immersed in the game.In my opinion, a must-buy for any fans of the original series, and recommended for any TBS fans.

												This game has everything you could ever ask for in an XCOM re-make. It expands on the concept and delivers high quality gameplay, graphics and sound design. In contrast to the Firaxis XCOM re-boot, this game retains the micro management aspect of base building and maintainence instead of skipping over those details for the sake of getting into more ground combat action. It's basically like a HD version of the original XCOM but with some added features and a cool cold-war era setting. I like it. :$			"

												Spiffing! As everyone knows, unlike the reimaged XCom that came out recently, this Xenonauts is an update of the original Xcom. And it's very well done. You have the base management. Placing bases for their radar coverage, with hangars to send ships out to intercept alien craft. Then send in your landing vehicle for your troops and maybe a buggy to go round gunning down the survivors of the crashed alien craft. Could also be going in to a Terror Mission. To fight off the aliens and save what locals you can and maintain relations with the nation so terrorised. Might be the alliens attack your base and gun batteries you've chosen to build may or may not be enough, and then have to clear your base of aliens the hard way. Could be you discover a base the aliens have set up. Going in to clear it room by room.The base management leaves a lot of room for playstyles and mistakes. Setting up labs and workrooms for scientists to research alien tech and engineers to make new toys. So many toys. Found it best to keep the enhanced workshop action at the base your soldiers come home to, other bases wouldn't have access to the alien materials unless you start sending parcels of items back and forth. Extra radar arrays widen the coverage of each base, and extra bases spaced around the planets are essential in ensuring few alien craft get to run amok without you sending in your ships.When you do that, you can choose to send 1-3 ships all together. So that requires you building hangers at various bases around the world too. When  your ships catch an alien craft it gives you a % of success for an automated dogfight, but you can elect to go in to manually direct the aero-action. When an alien craft is downed you can send in your foot troops, or, just have an airstrike deal alien stragglers. Youll get a bt of money that way but no chance of acquiring fancy alien tech to play with. The land battle is as ever a turn based game.  Your mooks have a number of points they can spend on moving, kneeling, turning, shooting, luzzing grenades, equipping the med pack from your backpack to use on a wounded ally, or battering an alien over the head with a stun rod. With shooting there's a few choices in how accurate you're prepared to be, more accuracy costs more points. Cover reduces the ahcne of success while kneeling raises it. You could leave your mook with points unspent in which case they're stood there prepared to fire at any alien bugger that hoves into view. Their reflexes stat comes into play then, whether they get a shot off before the alien does. Stats like those and strength (covers how much you can carry without movement penalties) and bravery are automatically improved when they're used. So it really hurts if someone dies. If a xenonaut is hit and hurt they'll spend some time in the med-bay you built. Dead ones, there's a slim chance they recover, less so the more they're hurt.It seems rather well designed. The learning curve is about right. The arms race between you and the aliens is in your favour if you get on top of R&D early on and keep it flowing. One of your more beloved xenonauts taking a powerful hit and dying can really sting though. You could be brave and suck it up, or go back to a previous save point. It quite a moddable game in regards ""numbers"", so you could adjust such things as the amount of money here or there if you want. It wouldn't affect the current game, just the next one started.			"

												This is a really good game, and in many regards, this is indeed XCOM's true successor.- The tactical game feels a lot like the original, with the same dilemmas and cold sweats, but with a nice gameplay refresh integrating modern concepts such as cover. It is a real success; the general way you play the game is very faithful to the original game, but it is significantly deeper and more interesting.- The same can be said for the strategic game. The general feeling is the same as in the original game, but it is much, much more complex and the game has little forgiveness for people who make wrong choices.- The interception minigame is really nice. There are a few problems that should be solved (some dogfights which have good success chances on autoresolve are actually unwinnable if you try to play them) but it adds something that had not been attempted or done right by any of the previous XCOM-inspired games.- The general cold war atmosphere is nice and the flavour text (research reports, news ticker, etc.) fleshes out the universe nicely. All the text-based universe description is a real success.- The music is good, and the sound effects are good too.Now a few criticisms:- The graphics. Seriously. The geoscape and base layout screens are OK. The background art (research/engineering screens, etc.) is decent, even though it lacks something. Everything else is horrible. The aliens, the equipment, most of the armours and almost everything in the tactical game is ugly, bland and unremarkable. I would go as far as saying that I prefer the visuals from the 1994 game in their VGA splendor. They are pixelated and often cheesy in a 90s SF way, but they have a character that is completely absent here. Even the recent X-COM: Enemy Unknown, which is much more bland and soulless than Xenonauts in many ways, easily wins this match.- The UFO missions eventually become repetitive. True, you can airstrike crash sites, but it is often not an economically viable option, and the combination of low resources, quite slow research and high enemy activity leads to phases of the game where you have nothing else to do than wait for your research/engineering projects to eventually complete while playing non-stop difficult missions which look a lot like one another, have each the potential to wipe your team, and do not bring you any reward except some cash and the chance to live another day. This is somehow realistic, but not so funny.- This is not a true Linux game: the developers juste made special efforts to make the game run correctly with Wine. This is not nothing, and I don't blame the developers, but Wine compliance is not the same at all as a native GNU/Linux version, and I find it misleading and disappoingint to see it listed as a ""Linux game"" on Steam. (And even more so since you can't even install the Linux Wine port through Steam) This is one of the reasons why I so readily bought this game, and although it is a fine game, on that point I feel cheated.

I usually stay away from games like this because the old school X-Com games set my standards too high, but this.. Is the game I've been waiting for since 1998 with Apocalypse. I must say if you want to take turns shooting aliens in the face, this is the game you need to buy. Unless you care about new fancy graphics. (That being said this game looks as good as it needs to)I give it a 9.5 out of 10 only because X-Com came first and set the bar so high.			"

												Finally, a game which is Xcom faithfully remade for modern computers.  (I love Firaxis' Xcom, but while an incredible game, it changes a few key things (multiple bases, the feeling of ALWAYS being one step behind the aliens, large squads) which makes it just not scratch the same itch.My ONLY complaint:  The Cryssalid analogues in this game are not nearly scary enough, unlike the original which had me shutting down the computer (at the age of 8) in what would now be called a NOPENOPENOPE moment.

												This game is excellent but frustrating. The harder difficulties are very unforgiving if you have not played the game or the original xcom games. Combat is exciting but takes time to learn. Air combat also take time to learn. For instance, if the screen says you have 100% chance of winning by autoresolving, that still means you can lose if you fight the ufos manually. My final complaint aobut the game is that navigating the many screens can be somewhat difficult. Overall, though, this is a very well done game that is worth playing.			"

												I really have enjoyed the short time I have put into this game. After one Ironman run where I ultimately have to restart, I couldn't be happier! The amount of depth and customization is really great! I enjoy a lot of things about this game, and as someone who got into the Xcom series a bit late.. I find the UI preferable to the classics and the title a good way to experience the old elements of the xcom series that didn't carry over to the newest release. A good game in it's own right, and a good route to go if you want something harder in the same genre as enemy unknown/within. A great spiritual successor to the older entires and brings back memories of old school TBS gaming.The few little problems I have run across are more than overlookable.I am quite glad to see where this game has gone, being hesitant at first to hop on it until more development was accomplished! I would say in it's current state it is a quality product, well worth the price tag!			"

												Look at the title of the game, It's not XCOM, get that through your head. It has very similar mechanics, and fictional setting, but is not XCOM, so if you are a bored XCOM fan who beat all of the new installments; this may not be a good purchase for you. Secondly, if you choose to continue and buy the game, know that it is beyond realisticly hard, in which you need to keep up with the fast pace of the game or you will fail and basically need to make a new game. Two, understand you are fighting a space faring race, fighting as a non-space faring race and are at a critical disadvantage. What am I trying to say? This game is hard, you need to learn fast, make good decisions, have a plan, always save the game, and keep your airfleet either in strong numbers or advanced. Welcome to Xenonauts.			"

												To give you an idea of what this game is like, I wrote this:You are the last man in your squad, Reapers have zombified every human in the city and to your dismay one of them pursuing you. You are too busy looking behind you to realize you have been backed into an alley,  you look behind you once again to see your adversary facing you, Snappinng It's massive mouth with hundreds of incredibly sharp teeth. You can feel its hot breath against your skin, you think it is the end, and put your rifle's muzzle against your neck. But your luck changes, and you realize the reaper has exhausted their time unit supply. You lower the gun and point it at the reaper, ""95% it will hit."" you think to yourself. You point your rifle at the reaper's head, and close your eyes. ""A 95% chance I will live."" You smile and pull the trigger. You hear the gun fire and feel the recoil of the bullet leaving the chamber, you open your eyes and hope to see a headless reaper corpse in front of you. Unfortunate as it is, you missed the shot and the reaper in front of you still has a head and still wants to kill you and use your body as a vessel for its parasitic spawn.10/10 would lose ""Pvt. John Mctiggles"" exactly like that again.			"

I dont recommend this game to people who want something fast and shinny, here you need to hire soldiers, engineers and scientists and manage them, be careful with the budget and watch over each continents status without a status bar or something alike, unlike the last xcom here you dont have a panic score, you determine how the world is doing by the amount of straffing runs, bombardement, terror missions, etc the aliens are succeding			"

Cold war time period, not my preference.Some may say its lacking things that other modern turn based games may have.But if memory serves, it's faithful to the original.

Better than the new Firaxis Xcom. Cant wait to see what Goldhawk Interactive can do with a bigger budget production. Please include an expansion and make the aliens ground combat more aggressive and more explsions.			"

												You like X-COM? Like, the one with the hyphen in it? You should play this, then. It removes most of the finicky spreadsheety stuff (which I kind of liked, but whatever), and keeps the game more centered around base design and combat and the heartbreaking loss of all your favourite dudes. Buy it twice!			"

												Have been trying this game since closed beta. It has really come together throught that time - mature, polished.As a game it is true successor to old X-com. Good game mechanics that give freedom for tactics and strategy, but not overly micro-managing. If you like this time of games it is a must-have. If you are new to this type of games - try Firaxis X-COM Enemy Unknown first.			"

												Xenonauts is in essence an X-COM game after the spirit of the orignal title. I enjoyed the recent Firaxsis XCOMs and, obviously, they are graphically superior to Xenonauts, however Xenonauts has a greater depth of strategic play. Like in the original X-COM, Time Units allow your soldiers to perform complex tasks on the battlefield and this puts paid to my biggest beef with the Firaxsis games. Just like in olden times Soldiers can now shoot then move then crouch and turn, open doors and reload and these actions can be performed in any order as long as there are sufficient time units available to them. No longer will a reload always end my turn and no longer do I need a soldier with a special skill to be able to shoot then move! This alone makes Xenonauts eminently playable for anyone interested in the genre and is one of many areas that the game gets right.			"

												XCOM:UFO Defense was released the year I graduated. Let me clarify that I do not remember the release date because it is the same as my graduation. I remember my graduation date because of the release date. I first saw this played on a 486DX and then had to hack and upgrade my Tandy 1000EX to be able to run it. I spent $700 in 1993 money to upgrade my RAM to a whopping 768kb. In the end I upgraded machines to play this, Mechwarrior and AOE.I have also played numerous attempts at sequels, upgrades and fan made remakes. There is NOTHING that come even close to this one. This game is solid, true to it's roots and adds, answers all the things you wanted in the original without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the things that made it unique. True the last update wiped the scalable destruction but it is a small price to pay. I would spend twice the price for this.			"

												This is good, x-com defense remake. has quite a nostalgic feel to it and lots of good equipment to make and develop. its mostly exactly the same as the old one with nicer graphics and new things, but its still quite boring. like the original i guess thats its quality, its very involved and sucks you in.i would only recomend it for die hard fans. newcomers would be put of by its structure. for eg at the start all soldiers can move like 2 squares and never hit anything. until they get a few kills then they are ok at moving and shooting, then eventually they can run milles and hit anything.well what im trying to say is thats normal for a ufo game. but new comerS would be like 'I CANT KILL ANYTHING WHY CANT I MOVE URGH THIS IS TOTAL UNBALANCED POOPOO'thats the best part loving your troops for thier strength and weakness.

												Holy crap, this game, smells and looks like the original X-com, but it looks like the original X-com we remember playing with our rose tinted glasses of the past, in laymans terms, that means that the original game didn't look as good as this, but  we'd like to think it did. Couple this with mod support and the outstanding community edition that is available through steam, and this game is a winner winner, chicken dinner. You can play through this game however you want to, do you brink a vehicle or two extra xeonauts? do you bring heavy or light guns? just grenades? pretty much any strategy works on the battlefield if your patient enough to make it work. most games these days hold your hand, this one will help you at the start but just like a parent teaching their child to ride a bike you'll soon notice those hands on your back are gone, how long have they been gone? you don't know because this game is easy to learn, but very hard to master.There will be times when this game will make you want to rage quit, thats normal, thats called building a connection with your troops and then some alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his plasma power sniper rifle gets a lucky shot and blow out their head/chest cavity with a bolt of plasma, thats what happens when your going up against superior tech. Your only way to win is to get tactical.Although iron man mode isn't the only way to play this game, its singleplayer you play however you want to play, want to load a save game everytime something goes wrong? you can do, its called learning. my first playthrough was somewhat like that, i took my fair share of losses, and even with repeated reloading, the game was still very challenging. My second playthrough is shaping up to be a much tougher, and rougher challenge without the reloading. And if i can justify giving this game another run through you can justify playing it if you have any love of tactical games. ( especially if it is on sale like it is right now!)			"

												This game is not fair.Let's get that out of the way right off the bat. If you're looking for something you can play well and have no chance of failing horribly, this is not it. One bad mission, one stroke of bad luck, can send you spinning down the path to destruction.However, there are a great many selling points that keep me coming back to this game; while it isn't fair, if you accept that you will have a good time. This game forces you to think. There will be many times when you will think, ""oh, there's probably no aliens there; I can afford to rush or leave it unguarded"". Well, if you think that, stop yourself. Mistakes are not dealt with lightly in this game, and rushing is not a luxury you can often take.  Likewise, always have a contingency plan for when you miss. No - scratch that- have three. Because if you leave your team in the hands of someone with a shotgun, and that Andron manages to survive those shots, you just lost a valuable team member, if not two. Leave enough time for your rifleman to pop around the corner and finish him off, or else you will cry. Remember - 70% chance to hit is just an optimistic way to say 30% chance to miss. This game does not like impatience.But it's just so *satisfying*! Blowing your first corvette out of the sky, capturing that first xeno, and clearing out every last alien crash site feels great. And you get the satisfaction of knowing you did it right. Plus this game has all of the options you can possibly want in terms of ground battles. It all works just as you'd expect, and the customization in loadouts along with the options you have in ground battles in terms of strategy makes the game very compelling, and keeps me coming back every time I get frustrated. In the end, no, it's not fair, but there's always something you can do to even the odds, and it all depends on just how much time you're willing to take.			"

												--Best XCOM Game Ever--This is a remake of the oringinal XCOM game. Not the same name as it was done with seperate developers without the rights. Their goal was to stay true to the original...and they did an amazing job. It cleans up the old game with new graphics, interface, and engine but keeps the mechanics intact. I highly recommend this game to any XCOM fan, especially those that would still play the original from time to time even 15-20 years later.			"

												Xenonauts is a nice tactical turn based strategy game incorporated with RTS global management of your forces and bases. You will have to balance your money and forces to protect earth from the alien invasion.To get your funding to fight the aliens you need to keep all the nations in the Xenonauts initiative protected so that they feel that they get anything back from the money they give you or they will abandon the Xenonaut project.The turn based fighting are interesting and can be difficult if you do not proceed with care and tactics. One down side to the fighting is the limited amounts of maps and it can be a bit repetative. But hopefully v1.5 are going to address that problem, otherwise there are mods to fix and improve the gaming experience as well.			"

												I actually deleted my first review of this game, in light of my opinion on it changing considerably.Do I recommend the game, still? Mildly, yes. Do I like it? Yeah! Do I LOVE it? No, no I do not.I bought this game mostly because X-Com Classic is incredibly old and boy oh boy did I not want to have to deal with that god forsaken UI, yet at the same time, I wanted to see what was missing from XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within. So, I bought this game.The game developers seem to have made numerous changes to the game, from X-Com. They are all based on good intentions, but... well, you know what they say about good intentions. For one, the developers removed weapons like Blaster Launchers. While that's all well and good, the developers also decided to cut Psychic Powers entirely out of the game. It sounded like a good idea, at first (Mind Control was pretty broken, come on, guys), it seriously neuters the game's variety. As the game progresses, missions start to feel the same, and some of them drag on way too long. After a few months into the campaign, save for some new alien species appearing, there was very little difference in overall gameplay. And because the missions are so dry and repetitive, it quickly starts to feel like a damn grind. Now, one could say the missions in XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within were also repetitive -- and I won't lie to you, they became rather tiresome (especially in the lackluster endgame). But Enemy Unknown had many mechanics that made it enjoyable, most importantly the perks that each soldier got. Yeah it may not be realistic but honestly I would much rather have perks, than have every single soldier be completely interchangeable -- and that's what it's like in Xenonauts. Every soldier is basically the same. Every mission is the same. Without things like perks and abilities, combat gets boring FAST. Oh, and you don't profit from selling alien items, like you did in X-com. Again, balance issues and good intentions. But the economy in this game is already quite stressful. Oh, and also, not being able to make a profit selling weapons capable of hurting aliens to a world that is in desperate need of them makes NO GOD DAMN SENSE! So how do you make money? You grind your balls off raiding every UFO that touches Terran dirt, which is what makes the combat gameplay grow stale!Man, you know, thinking about it -- I honestly have no idea if I can recommend this game. It's pretty moddable, but even mods only do so much. The combat is kind of nice, though. Reminds me of Fallout.I give it a cautious and confused recommendation, because despite its flaws, I can't bring myself to hate the game. Also, many of the game's features can literally be tinkered with simply by opening the .xml files in OpenOffice or something -- which I personally did to end that profit nonsense mentioned above.

												This is one of the best turn based strategy games I have ever played. It is very well made; I have seen no glitchs or bugs, and the controls make miss-clicks a rare occurence. The difficulty scale is great as well. At the lower levels, it is more forgiving for new players yet still really fun. At the higher difficulties, it requires a high level of both stategic and tactical knowledge to survive, providing a very satisfiying challenge that I have not seen since Civ V.The only problems I have with the game is that it does not tell how long some things may take to do, like researching tech and hiring new personel. This is a minor issue however, because after several playthroughs you have a general idea of how long these things may take to do.Overall, Xenonauts is a great strategy game (9 of 10) and is well worth playing.

												Xenonauts is a distillation of the X-COM formula to challenge veterans looking for something a little more down-to-earth than Firaxis's XCOM: Enemy Unknown.Success comes in a different package that may not be obvious to UFO Defense alumni. Veterans would think to fill their warchests by raiding landed Supply Ships and mass-producing Laser Cannons. In the Cold War, however, it's up to the funding nations to supply you - you're fighting against both time and budget constraints as you rush to research and manufacture enough new technology to have some hope of staying ahead of the alien invasion, all while keeping your neighbors happy.Ensuring the funding nations remain impressed and satisfied means spending time and resources on the Geoscape and the air game - radar coverage and interceptors. Shooting down UFOs pleases those who pay your bills; failure to effectively react to the disaster tickers is undesirable, the casualty gauge looming overhead as an ever-present reminder of the Xenonauts' reponsibilities.This also acts as something of a de-emphasis on the Battlescape: while you will want to check out new UFOs to add research options, raiding every crash site in every wave will inevitably feel grindy and the monetary rewards would take months to make a difference in the long run. Sending your top dudes to earn a few extra bucks will inevitably backfire when you lose your ace Sniper, forcing you to spend a hundred grand and two weeks to recruit her replacement and manufacture a new weapon and armor. It's much safer to sell the site to the locals, still paying for half a new Plasma Rifle while letting someone else do the dirty work, saving your vets for the new type of UFO due to appear next week.In closing, this is *the* X-COM clone we've been waiting years for. Many games have treid to replicate the formula but Xenonauts has gotten it right like no other.			"

It's up to you to manage resources, teams and money for maximum efficiency.This is a great turn base game and also real time. If you love xcom or any turn base type games this is the one not to miss.There are a few glitches but the dev team has been doing a great job patching. After all this is an indie game you have to give them lots of love for their time. "

												The best Simply the best hardcore game i have ever played.I have failed so many times that i strain myself to learn how to play this game because of how difficult this game is.U WILL lose man almost every mission if u are not careful and the aliens will have new units,items etc as the game progresses and if u dont keep up with their technology u are gonna get screwed when u meet them on the battlefield or when they attack ur base.YEP i said it there is base defence.There is base constructions where u can build bases around the world i dont know the max amount of bases u can have but it adds more variety to ur choices on how u want to build ur base as u have to decide what to build. the living quaters for more man? the lab,the workshop,the hangar,the medic centre? EtcEvery month u will receive money from the countries u have protected and trust me u will have to defend a lot of them or else the money u get after a month is going to be less and less and less. I got bankrupt once because i only protected asia :P You will feel your soldiers veterancy as they crack less under pressure gain higher stats like,accuracy,health etcand of course u will have those POS(piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ privates getting panicked and shooting ur own team.The maps around the world changes as there is a randomizer or something like that which creates maps based on the terrain the ufo crashed on or and any other areas u are going to have battlesIn conclusion i want to say that this game is a bloody good game because of how hard it is and recommend that u go and buy this game NOW!!!10/10			"

												The best modern remake of X-com: UFO Defense and Terror From The Deep. It's the one most faithful to the old games.+ Improved interface/GUI, e.g. aiming interface is more like Jagged Alliance: right-click to improve accuracy.+ New air combat system that's much more fun.+ Eerie/Horror soundtrack similar to original games.+ Ground combat requires new tactics, e.g. grenades were nerfed, there is a suppression system.+ As in X-Com Apocalypse, you need to require live aliens and explosives destroy aliens bodies and equipment. So, it's more challenging to get live aliens.+ Improved graphics. Xenonauts and aliens animations are really fluid.+ So far (3rd month in the game), you can't seem to make money by creating items like in the old games. Your main source of income are the funding from the nations. Might be a minus for you.+ Quickstart guide and in-game tooltips lets you get started playing in no time.+ Geoscape now shows UFO events throughout the world, so you don't need to mess around with the cumbersome UFO Activity Graph like in the older games.+ Devs are still updating the game.+ The story and xenopedia entries are very well written.+ You can now air strike a UFO crash site for money, if you don't want/can't do the mission at the moment.+ Soundtrack and other goodies are included in the extras folder.+ Game is easily moddable.+/- Some parts of the game were simplified, but overall it still retains the essence of the original X-Com games. Some of those simplifications were: unlimited *basic* ammo/weapons, a single warehouse holds unlimited items, unlimited flares for night missions, buildings like missile defenses and some items like medkits are auto upgraded after research is done, alien items are sold/destroyed/stored automatically after a ground mission, soldiers don't have an energy meter.- Can't throw equipment to teammates. Have to drop it on the ground and have the other one pick it up.- I found the machinegun to be really useless.- Downed UFOs can only be entered through main door. You can't blow up any part of the hull, however you can still blow up the door.- Apparently, there is no incendiary ammo, particle disturbance grenade and particle sensor.Overall, the game is great! A must buy for X-Com fans. "

This game is the perfect modern remake of the older XCOMs, but better. They removed a lot of the useless buttons from the UI, made some better functionality, but retained all the fun of running your own alien defense company. Highly reccomended.			"

												This feels like a true sucessor to the original X-COM game, with all the improvements, and an interesting and somewhat fun air combat minigame...Using all the tools the world had...in 1979. I love it. Now if this company's next plan is a X-COM Apocalypse version (My favorite of the series), I'd be extremely happy.			"

												Fireaxis reimagined XCom, and did a fine job. Xenonauts, however, is a much more faithful recreation of the original. Graphics and sound are of course upgraded, and the game interface has been modernized. There's a third sub-game (air combat is now a thing), but all the old goodness is back. If you liked the original, you'll surely like Xenonauts.			"

												If - like me - you fondly remember the originals, THIS is the X-com for you. I like the Firaxis one enough - but it's not XCOM. It's a sort of over-simplified version with far too many annoying video sequences and sub-menus obviously to cater to our console cousins. THIS, however, is Xcom brought to the 21st century :)			"

												Play it with the money and weapons mods because it makes the game fair on your end. The money mod makes sense so I didn't feel any gamer guilt using it. If the world was under alien invasion I am pretty sure every goverment would scrap the idea of money and just use whatever resources Earth had to defend it....not charge those responsible defending for a garage and such. The weapons mods do give you a good advantage in a ways but still those aliens will one shot you, through a wall or just walk right up to your units and MURDER all of them. You will miss just about every shot and each alien takes about three to four rounds but with the weapons mods it gives you a chance. The air combat is great and hope XCOM 2 has something along the lines. Overall it is a great game, has that looming atmosphere of the unknown, great music, the art is good (especially in the alien autopsies and weapon/gear descriptions) besides the character models. They could have done a bit more because your soldiers look extremely plain and paper cut outs. The micromanagement of your bases and world events is pretty awesome too. I suggest this game if you liked XCOM games in anyway. Just use the mods, my first ten hours of this game were without them and I was so hopelessly frustrated.			"

												This. Game. Is. Fantastic!! I have played both the Xcom: Enemy Unknown and Xenonauts games. Without a doubt Xenonauts is even better i would say. The developers did far more with far less. I will recommend Xenonauts to any and everyone who loves strategy. I still can't beat the game (not that i am any good or anything) but i have 162 hours in so far and literally in ironman mode i keep getting my whole squad just brutally massacred with all my equipment and dropship completely lost. 10/10 for this game. This will really test your mettle. Especially in ironman mode when you are forced to live with every decision, and every casualty. Here is how a typical game goes for me, i start out kicking♥♥♥♥♥in the beginning, i invest a lot in labs and workshops so i can get new tech quickly. Then i run into a city battle with reapers, which is a brutal fight for simple survival. I often find myself just scrambling to get a couple of my guys out alive so i don't lose all their precious reverse engineered equipment. Chaos and blood shed under fire and brimstone at it's finest in turn based combat. All things in the map are destructable. So dont be surprised to end a mission with all the buildings destroyed, fire, blood and bodies of all walks of galactic life strewn across the killing fields. It's an amazing feeling to have half your squad just barely eek by with some luck and return home with horror stories of how brutal of a massacre it turned out to be. Don't be surprised if you end up saying to yourself, ""we lost a lot of very good men out there."" because chances are, you will lose a lot of very good men out there. If you are trying to decide between Xcom or Xenonauts, i will say save the money cause Xenonauts is cheaper and even still better. It plays better, it feels better. It's fun, and it will always be fun. Definately one of my all time favorite games. HIGHLY recommend. I repeat. HIGHLY recommend.			"

												Not a bad game overall.  Very similar to X-COM UFO Defense but graphics are better.  The technology treee is good too.  Some issues I have: --No way to judge or measure psionic power or resistance.  My bravest soldiers become alienized no matter what I do.--Unable to shoot weapons when in airborne levitating suits.  Very frustrating.--Program tends to lock up when using alien transporter and alien shoots you at the same time.  Happened every time.--No ability to downgrade weapons for base defense.  Not sure about this one.--Weapon aiming system for soilders could be tweeked.  Tend to miss targets at very close range.  --Money is very hard to come by.  It costs more money to make something than the selling price.  At least in X-COM, I          could make something for 15000 and sell it for 20000.  Not so in Xenonauts .--More emphasis on soilders would be nice.  Building thier abilites and skills could be better.--Better armour on vehicles.--Better armour or at least more choices for soilder armour.--More single random alien attacks would be nice instead of a barrage of 10 alien ships attacking globally at once.--Battle sites need more randomizing.  All battles seem the same after a while.  For example, why not have a crashed            alien ship with only 1 alien alive.--Allow more Xenonaut soldiers in a battle.  I think the limit is 10?  Not sure about this one.I only have have 150 hours so playing the game.  I haven't read the rule book so I may have missed a few things or made some errors with my analysis shown above.  I managed to get to the end game but did not defeat the Master Preator or whateve it's called (at least not yet).  This was my third try after the first two attempts failed (mostly due to lack of money).  This was also done using the the ""easy"" setting.  It wasn't very easy.Overall, a good game that I recommend for those who like strategy games.  I think with some fine tuning, this game could rival the original X-COM in popularity and playability.  I give it a 7 out of 10 rating. "

												If you don't like outdated graphics of the original 90s XCOM you can get this instead.If you don't mind the old graphics you can just get OpenXCOM/TFTD.Anyway, gameplaywise it's an improvement in that you don't need to manage things like ammo manufacturing, or selling alien loot which means less fiddling with your base inventory.And you'll get to keep armor out of dead soldiers assuming they didn't get blown up.As for combat, researched weapons are usually just +1 of the previous one. Nothing wrong with that, I mean, infinite ammo laser guns on UFO Defense was ridiculous anyway.Also there's a new mechanic that lets you suppress enemies which makes them unable to reaction fire and start the next turn with half TU.Oh and you can't spam auto shot in this game either, so it mostly comes to play with a machine gun or flashbang, which are basically grenades that suppress enemies.You can't throw weapons or set grenade timers in this game either and play hot potato either. Which admittedly was cheesy anyway.Anyway if you've played the 90s XCOM it won't feel *too* out of place.If you're new you can start getting into the gameplay and transition to the older XCOM and you'll do fine.

												Xenonauts certainly is an old fashioned game primarily for original X-COM fans. Graphics are somewhat outdated (though lovaly drawn) but it may even be for the best. I would go as far as to say that it's better than original X-COM. At the very least in terms of lore (which is fantastic) and plot. Plus Intercepting minigame is actually useful and fun and various types of weapons and armor make tactics more diverse. Flat earth with perfect circle coverage form radar dishes nearby poles gives me creeps but at least I don't have to struggle with full general stores anymore.But really it's pretty much the same old X-COM: UFO Defense updated and expanded. I highly recommend.No psyonics for your squad though.			"

												I have never played any of the previous XCOM games. I just want people who also haven't to know that about me up front.My experience with Xenonauts has been excellent. This is an addictive game that will have you hooked with that 'JUST ONE MORE TURN' addiction that all good games have. I highly recommend this game to any turn-based strategy fan. Before I go any further, if you decide to play this game, you NEED to play it on Ironman mode; that's what makes this game so great. It's a mode where you aren't allowed to save-scum, so all of your actions, and mistakes, are permanent.I consider myself fairly well versed on turn-based strategy games. I'm a 31 year old gamer who has very fond childhood memories of early strategy games like Shining Force, Dark Wizard, Final Fantasy Tactics, OgreBattle, Civilization, Heros of M&M, as well as more modern strategy games like Disgaea. I enjoyed and still enjoy every single one of them, but none have made me feel quite the way that Xenonauts does.This is how Xenonauts goes: Pick your starting base, outfit your soldiers with various weapons such as shotguns, RPGs, grenades, riot shields, and sniper rifles based on their stats, send your planes out to intercept UFOs that come within range of your base(s), send out a strike team to recover the downed UFO, use strategy and tactics to successfully eliminate all of the aliens, recover alien artifacts, weapons, etc, get back on the dropship and return home. Have your scientists research new technologies based on the alien artifacts you find, then have your engineers build them using the materials you've recovered in battle. Equip your troops with better weapons and armor so they can deal with increasingly dangerous alien footsoldiers, build faster, more powerful aircrafts to deal with increasingly dangerous alien ships, build tanks to give your troops support in fights, defend your base from attacking UFOs, send out troops to defend cities that are under attack, and send troops in to demolish alien bases. You are trying to keep the various nations around the globe happy. The more you engage and successfully deter alien attacks within their airspace, the more money they will pay you. Ignore a region for a while, and they may give up on the Xenonauts program entirely.The battles will sometimes have you deliberating on a single action for several minutes if there is a lot at stake. You find yourself in a precarious situation. Should you bumrush the alien hope you shotgun it to death before it reacts? Should you stay where you are and lob a grenade, hoping you blow it up? Should you retreat back to safety, allowing the alien to do the same? The AI isn't stupid. Most of the aliens are going to engage you stragically, hiding behind cover, around corners, running when surrounding, throwing grenades when your troops are clumped up. They aren't going to come rushing at you while you hide behind sandbags, allowing themselves to be mowed down. They want YOU to come to them. And they have better technology and sometimes greater numbers. You really have to be patient with this game. You go out there running and gunning at the aliens and I'm certain you will not be successful for very long.The core of the game is the strategic ground battles, of course, but there is strategy at all levels in this game. Money is a big one. You are never going to be able to afford everything you want until maybe the very end of the game. Are you going to build more bases to cover more land? You will certainly need to, but the timing is up to you. Are you going to be able to afford a whole new platoon of troops for that new base? Interceptors? Defense missiles? New bases take up a significant portion of your money. Should you hire more scientists so that you can research new technologies faster? Those scientists cost $10,000 per person per month... and you need to build barracks to house them. Ditto with Engineers, but you'll need more to build more advanced weapons ships and armor. Recently had a battle that went really poorly? You're going to have to hire new soldiers, and help them succeed in battle to gain experience/stats. You have to be smart with your money in this game. Strategic.New technologies take time to research, and more time to build. You need to prioritize. Should you research better weapons or armor first? Is it worth the time researching and building that tank? Should you build that new interceptor now? Do you really need it NOW or can you use the time/money on something else? Should you prioritize new warplanes so that you can protect the nations that fund you? Or should you focus on weapons and armor so that you can raise the survival rate of your troops, making them more experienced and efficient over time? Should you focus on tanks that will draw fire away from your troops, increasing soldier survivability? Should you outfit one soldier with a riot shield? Two? Three? Four? How many RPGs? How many assault rifles? Does your base really need that many missile batteries, or is it just 'nice'?The answers to all of these questions is: Balance. You will need to do everything, ultimately, but you need to prioritize and plan for the short and long term. You'll need to take calculated risks, whether it's in battle or with money. You'll need to make sacrifices (Sure, you'd love to have that 3rd base up NOW, but can you truly afford it now? Or are you risking losing a whole region's funding?). Unlike the games I've mentioned above, you can't do everything in this game. This is not a game where you fight a battle, win, go to the next town, revive your people, buy all the latest equipment and head to the next battle. You can't revive your troops, and you can't simply buy the new equipment you want, because a) you have to research and build everything from scratch, there are no stores, and b) you don't have the money to buy everything anyway. As I said, the strategy is at all levels in this game, and each level affects the others. Balancing all of this is your key to being successful.So what makes Xenonauts special? Ironmade mode. With it, there is a sense of desperation and panic that you will sometimes experience. You are going to take losses. Your strategies aren't always going to work. Plans are going to go awry. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to shake your head, kick yourself, and have regrets. If you're playing on ironman mode, as I HIGHLY recommend, you don't get to reload your last save and save that soldier. He's dead. Forever. That tank that got blown up is gone forever. If you fail an alien terror mission, that city gets wiped from the face of the Earth and you lose significant funding. But maybe you had to retreat from that mission because you were getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you? Maybe things didn't go so well, and you decided that the loss in funding was better than losing all of your experienced soldiers and the expensive equipment they were carrying. Sometimes the game feels 'cheap'. Sometimes you will get sniped by an alien you can't even see. One hit KO'd behind cover, soldier gone forever. You didn't even make a mistake. It's a situation you'd have to be clairvoyant to prevent. The aliens are more advanced than you, afterall. They're going to have better weapons and armor. But Xenonauts's shining moments come when you overcome those failures, setbacks, and mistakes. When all the chips are on the table and you're outgunned and outnumbered and you still emerge victorious, although not nearly unscathed. When you are attacking an alien base and half your squad gets wiped out by a grenade thrown from around the corner but you still somehow win. When you're down to your last clip of ammo and half the map is blown up in an alien terror mission and your last two soldiers barely kill the last alien. THAT is what makes this game great.This game makes me feel a way that no other strategy game ever has. And it is EXTREMELY rewarding.			"

												Xenonauts is an echo from a time when XCOM was X-Com. What makes the game good is not that it hails from X-Com, but rather adds a new life to the game, further expanding on what makes X-Com good. For one, the game's updated graphics allows for the concept of cover to now be a thing, rather than hoping that this wall is going to save me. Secondly, the game adds in different weapons to help breach those pesky UFO doors and not get mowed down in the process. Third, the game does not shaft newer players in the first month, rather, it shafts players in a long, drawn-out, painful fashion. If you want to play X-Com, but don't feel like running DOSbox to play it, or want to see what it'd look like with a updated graphical engine, this game is for you.			"

												Review:An almost perfect game, especially if your looking for a game like the classic XCOM.  Unfortunatly there are not really any others these days so this game definitely fills the void.  Yeah it has some problems and a few glitches here and there such as an alien, rarely, being able to get that shot off through a wall killing a guy but with the same line of sight back you cant shoot them.  It is rare but it does happen.  The main difference between this game and the classic XCOM is that Xenonauts uses a 2D system rather than the 3D one XCOM: Ufo Defense had.  This has its limitations and is probably the biggest gripe I have with this game because it makes the line of sight issues, among other things.  It calculates the chance of hit, does the math, and then either hits or misses the target while cover dramatically reduces that chance.  This is opposed to XCOM's 3D engine where it instead used a complex calculation with the accuracy taken into account and calculated a trajectory of the bullet and whatever it hit it hit, whether it be a guy way off the side of the target, hitting the guy behind the target, or just flying off the map.  It was much more fun that way, with this game their system is ok but definitely a step back.  On the bright side I hear Goldhawk is using a 3D engine for their sequel so hopefully the next game is going to be the true successor to this genre.Pros:+Great Graphics (for the style they are going for)+Air battles are intense+Streamlined management (you still have to manufacture all the weapons besides the base ones, armour, planes, ect. except the ammo)  +Loadouts. You still have to account for how much ammo you bring, grenades, and everything of that nature with penalties if you bring too much.+Soldiers are now much easier to track (very powerful feature, something XCOM lacked in and you'll understand why when you play it)+Tons of tech+Cover mechanics are great but again I just wish it was a 3D engine+Has room for alot of strategy and different methods of play+Great community and many mods to change your experienceCons:-2D engine which accounts for most of the issues people have with line of sight and accuracy.  It isn't bad but the 3D engine would have been 100x better.  This is my biggest gripe with the game and is mainly the reason I feel the game isn't perfect (otherwise it would have been!)-Most other negative issues relate to the 2D issue such as not being able to through granades over walls, shoot someone in the air if their is a wall in the way, and other annoying little things like that.-Usually each map will have only 1 race of alien, sometimes 2 if they are similar, such as both being robotic for instance.  Theres a mod that changes that but thought it was worth mentioning.Last Thoughts:Personally I did not mind that my dudes would usually get 1-2 shotted as it adds to the difficulty, and for me the realism.  I can't immagine someone would take a few shots from a plasma gun, especially at close range, and keep chugging through like nothing happened.  It is manageable though, and if played right usually the casaulties can stay pretty low.  Also the game is pretty brutal and challenging, you always feel behind.  This game is all about trade offs.  Overall a great foundation for the sequel, but still alot of fun.  Great job Goldhawk amigos!If it had a 3D engine would be 9.5, but alas8.5/10			"

												I am a old gamer and loved the original X-Com games. I had tried the new version released the other year and I was massivly disapointed. It was just so dumbed down. It was very pretty but dumbed down. This lead me to look around for X-Com again and stumbled across Xenonauts. And I am so happy I found it. I can not praise this game enough. This is a real sucsessor to the original game. Thank you very much and I am not looking forward to Xenonauts 2, I feel it will be safe in your hands.			"

												This game is wonderful in all the ways that the classic xcom is. It is improved in everyway, the graphics are great. the game mechanics are wonderful and lots of micro managment style features that are a game in and of themselves. Aaaand then there is the BS. Like xcom you will miss impossible easy shots. drop grenades  and have collateral damage. This game magnifys thats by five times and thats being conservative. I am a veteran of the xcom franshise and have played hundreds of hours of both of these games. I am playing on easy (ironman mode) but still easy and I cannot even play the game because it feels like i am playing against a eight year old with god powers. ""nah you miss and hit a civilian, ohh is your friend throwing a grenade at me woops you dropped it and exploded half your squad"" ok now you panic and your friend goes bonkers and shoot into the rest of your squad. ok now my turn"".   I do love this game but it is not for the faint of heart and i wish they would just make it fair Ps. the doors on the ship always auto close at the end of the aliens turns. so you end up getting shot and to return fire you have to blast through doors. Makes it so much harder			"

												Basically it's XCOM, but different. They could have done more to make it not so alike, imo. The gameplay, the science, the missions and even enemy types are largely reminding me of XCOM. Ground battles work more like Jagged Alliance 2.But it doesn't matter. I sank 1k+ hours into XCOM and this is a nice and retro style variety. Set in the late 70s, with Cold War technology... at least at the start. It doesn't look as good as XCOM, nor is it as sleek an polished and yet this game too keeps you just going on and on and on, fighting mission after mission and seeing what else happens. I'm 12 hours in now. I hope this game starts developing a unique curve, because  at the moment - though enjoying it - it feels way too much like an xcom clone. Recommended for sheer addictiveness.

												Holy crap, this game, smells and looks like the original X-com, but it looks like the original X-com we remember playing with our rose tinted glasses of the past, in laymans terms, that means that the original game didn't look as good as this, but  we'd like to think it did. Couple this with mod support and the outstanding community edition that is available through steam, and this game is a winner winner, chicken dinner. You can play through this game however you want to, do you brink a vehicle or two extra xeonauts? do you bring heavy or light guns? just grenades? pretty much any strategy works on the battlefield if your patient enough to make it work. most games these days hold your hand, this one will help you at the start but just like a parent teaching their child to ride a bike you'll soon notice those hands on your back are gone, how long have they been gone? you don't know because this game is easy to learn, but very hard to master.There will be times when this game will make you want to rage quit, thats normal, thats called building a connection with your troops and then some alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his plasma power sniper rifle gets a lucky shot and blow out their head/chest cavity with a bolt of plasma, thats what happens when your going up against superior tech. Your only way to win is to get tactical.Although iron man mode isn't the only way to play this game, its singleplayer you play however you want to play, want to load a save game everytime something goes wrong? you can do, its called learning. my first playthrough was somewhat like that, i took my fair share of losses, and even with repeated reloading, the game was still very challenging. My second playthrough is shaping up to be a much tougher, and rougher challenge without the reloading. And if i can justify giving this game another run through you can justify playing it if you have any love of tactical games. ( especially if it is on sale like it is right now!)			"

												This game is not fair.Let's get that out of the way right off the bat. If you're looking for something you can play well and have no chance of failing horribly, this is not it. One bad mission, one stroke of bad luck, can send you spinning down the path to destruction.However, there are a great many selling points that keep me coming back to this game; while it isn't fair, if you accept that you will have a good time. This game forces you to think. There will be many times when you will think, ""oh, there's probably no aliens there; I can afford to rush or leave it unguarded"". Well, if you think that, stop yourself. Mistakes are not dealt with lightly in this game, and rushing is not a luxury you can often take.  Likewise, always have a contingency plan for when you miss. No - scratch that- have three. Because if you leave your team in the hands of someone with a shotgun, and that Andron manages to survive those shots, you just lost a valuable team member, if not two. Leave enough time for your rifleman to pop around the corner and finish him off, or else you will cry. Remember - 70% chance to hit is just an optimistic way to say 30% chance to miss. This game does not like impatience.But it's just so *satisfying*! Blowing your first corvette out of the sky, capturing that first xeno, and clearing out every last alien crash site feels great. And you get the satisfaction of knowing you did it right. Plus this game has all of the options you can possibly want in terms of ground battles. It all works just as you'd expect, and the customization in loadouts along with the options you have in ground battles in terms of strategy makes the game very compelling, and keeps me coming back every time I get frustrated. In the end, no, it's not fair, but there's always something you can do to even the odds, and it all depends on just how much time you're willing to take.			"

												I was pretty late to the X-COM scene, not discovering it until around 2006 or 2007 when a friend insisted I play it. It was not too long before the very unforgiving game won me over. I fell in love with the immense freedom it gave the player on the battlefield. Often rewarding inventive methods of defeating enemies, be it through altering the landscape around you or  experimenting with different load-outs and teams. The ability to build, manage, and defend bases all while balancing available resources was intriguing and rewarding. And naturally the ability to rename soldiers/sacrifices added immense entertainment value as well. Needless to say, I was suitably impressed!With the arrival of the Firaxis version, “Enemy Unknown”, I was skeptical. I learned they had removed many of the mechanics and features I had enjoyed so much in the original. After reading glowing reviews, I finally bit the bullet and picked up while on sale. And I was not disappointed! I still lamented the loss of the of the freedom I enjoyed in the original. However, I found that Firaxis had (in my opinion) made it a far more approachable and user friendly game than the original had been. With flashy graphics and enjoyable combat, it was a pleasurable experience. But all the same, I still missed many of the features from the original which had captured my imagination.Xenonauts came as a bit of a surprise to me though. At first glance it appeared to be no more than a clone of the original X-COM with updated graphics (which initially I was not very impressed by).  And for quite some time I ignored its development. Incidentally it was the same friend who introduced me to the franchise that suggested I try out Xenonauts. After well of 80 hours I can safely say it was a great experience and truly worth successor.The story is very well done. It is surprisingly compelling, and during my first play through I found the progression through the story to be quite exciting as a result. The base building, defense, and geoscape are a fine return to the series roots. You can once again build as many bases as you wish, and optimize them in whatever ways you see fit. The tech tree is also really impressive, beginning with cold war technology, you advance quite steadily into far more lethal technologies. The aliens themselves are well designed and enjoyable (for the most part) to fight. Even the art style which I initially disliked had grown on me. The aesthetic of the aliens, weapons, ships, backgrounds, technology/lore updates are all exceptional and help keep the player engaged.To top everything off, there is a healthy modding community. Often times if you have an issue with the core game, there is a mod out there somewhere which addresses it.Xenonauts is outstanding, and I highly recommend checking it out!			"

												If you liked the original X-Com and/or Terror From the Deep, you'll probably like this. Xenonauts is a more logical evolution of the gameplay of the older X-Com games than the new 2015 X-Com is. It uses time-units, you can pick up stuff from the ground or put it down, take weapons off dead enemies, etc. There is actual gameplay on the geoscape, multiple bases, etc.It adds a interceptor minigame that's decent, and for the most part removes annoying psionics. Sadly part of that is that there's none for you.Overall, I had a lot of fun with it.			"

There is no counterplay, no way to predict when a mission will have these attacks, and they can happen long before you find the enemy.

												To give you an idea of what this game is like, I wrote this:You are the last man in your squad, Reapers have zombified every human in the city and to your dismay one of them pursuing you. You are too busy looking behind you to realize you have been backed into an alley,  you look behind you once again to see your adversary facing you, Snappinng It's massive mouth with hundreds of incredibly sharp teeth. You can feel its hot breath against your skin, you think it is the end, and put your rifle's muzzle against your neck.

												I was pretty late to the X-COM scene, not discovering it until around 2006 or 2007 when a friend insisted I play it. It was not too long before the very unforgiving game won me over. I fell in love with the immense freedom it gave the player on the battlefield. Often rewarding inventive methods of defeating enemies, be it through altering the landscape around you or  experimenting with different load-outs and teams. The ability to build, manage, and defend bases all while balancing available resources was intriguing and rewarding. And naturally the ability to rename soldiers/sacrifices added immense entertainment value as well. Needless to say, I was suitably impressed!With the arrival of the Firaxis version, “Enemy Unknown”, I was skeptical. I learned they had removed many of the mechanics and features I had enjoyed so much in the original. After reading glowing reviews, I finally bit the bullet and picked up while on sale. And I was not disappointed! I still lamented the loss of the of the freedom I enjoyed in the original. However, I found that Firaxis had (in my opinion) made it a far more approachable and user friendly game than the original had been. With flashy graphics and enjoyable combat, it was a pleasurable experience. But all the same, I still missed many of the features from the original which had captured my imagination.Xenonauts came as a bit of a surprise to me though. At first glance it appeared to be no more than a clone of the original X-COM with updated graphics (which initially I was not very impressed by).  And for quite some time I ignored its development. Incidentally it was the same friend who introduced me to the franchise that suggested I try out Xenonauts. After well of 80 hours I can safely say it was a great experience and truly worth successor.The story is very well done. It is surprisingly compelling, and during my first play through I found the progression through the story to be quite exciting as a result. The base building, defense, and geoscape are a fine return to the series roots. You can once again build as many bases as you wish, and optimize them in whatever ways you see fit. The tech tree is also really impressive, beginning with cold war technology, you advance quite steadily into far more lethal technologies. The aliens themselves are well designed and enjoyable (for the most part) to fight. Even the art style which I initially disliked had grown on me. The aesthetic of the aliens, weapons, ships, backgrounds, technology/lore updates are all exceptional and help keep the player engaged.To top everything off, there is a healthy modding community. Often times if you have an issue with the core game, there is a mod out there somewhere which addresses it.Xenonauts is outstanding, and I highly recommend checking it out!			"

												The alternative to XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within, or vice versa. Xenonauts sticks closer to the original XCOM than the official reboot, which leads to some notable differences (amongst others). In all three games, you lead a section of infantry against an alien force that's superior both in quality and quantity. Unlike XCOM, though, your troops are actually a crack team of veterans recruited from around the world. That is, your privates can actually hit a target 10 metres away and not freak out when it looks at them funny afterwards. Also in keeping with the traditional game, the clock's been rolled back - but even further than the original, to the late 1970s. Yes, that's right: your soldiers are using M16s and M60s, and the Soviet Union still exists. Your equipment can be far better or far worse than in the ""official"" reboot as a result.In conclusion, the game is a very good compromise, nestled between XCOM:EU and XCOM:EW with the Long War mod installed. If you want an ""easy"" game with modern graphics and a minimal air war component, play XCOM:EW. For a surreal-bordering-on-pure-evil level of difficulty, go with Long War. For something that's in the happy medium between the two (or if you just want a nostalgia trip), pick up Xenonauts. Heck, pick up both successors if you want. One can be just as good as the other, depending on what you're looking for.			"

												This game is wonderful in all the ways that the classic xcom is. It is improved in everyway, the graphics are great. the game mechanics are wonderful and lots of micro managment style features that are a game in and of themselves. Aaaand then there is the BS. Like xcom you will miss impossible easy shots. drop grenades  and have collateral damage. This game magnifys thats by five times and thats being conservative. I am a veteran of the xcom franshise and have played hundreds of hours of both of these games. I am playing on easy (ironman mode) but still easy and I cannot even play the game because it feels like i am playing against a eight year old with god powers. ""nah you miss and hit a civilian, ohh is your friend throwing a grenade at me woops you dropped it and exploded half your squad"" ok now you panic and your friend goes bonkers and shoot into the rest of your squad. ok now my turn"".   I do love this game but it is not for the faint of heart and i wish they would just make it fair Ps. the doors on the ship always auto close at the end of the aliens turns. so you end up getting shot and to return fire you have to blast through doors. Makes it so much harder			"

Xenonauts is a more logical evolution of the gameplay of the older X-Com games than the new 2015 X-Com is. It uses time-units, you can pick up stuff from the ground or put it down, take weapons off dead enemies, etc. There is actual gameplay on the geoscape, multiple bases, etc.It adds a interceptor minigame that's decent, and for the most part removes annoying psionics.

												If you enjoyed the original X-COM: UFO Defense, this is a good update.  The graphics feel a bit dated, sharp but only isometric and unrotatable.  The only drawback, I find, is that the game seems to drag.  I'm over 100 UFOs having been encountered, and while it seems I'm on the final leg of the technology tree, I'm not in a position to finish the game.  The difficulty feels about right at the easiest level, but there are still situations where soldiers die and there's nothing you can do to have prevented it (except going back and reloading a save game) ... the 'it kills you if it gets too close' monster is a bit much, when plasma torpedoes can be resisted by armor.

There is no counterplay, no way to predict when a mission will have these attacks, and they can happen long before you find the enemy.

The old problem of hunting through the whole map for that one elusive enemy has been eliminated! The only thing I'm disappointed with is the lack of selling off the starting equipment  (although this is about the only gripe I can think of).Altogether, a great game which I've spent over 100 hours playing, replaying and playing some more.I would be happy to recommend this to any turn-based strategy gamer.

												Essentially, this is an alternate universe version of XCOM harkening back to the classic titles and done fully in 2D. And how good is that 2d? I love it. Huge respect to the team at Goldhawk for going all in and not taking the easy way out with halfassed 2.5D/3D. In my opinion being 2D really adds to the classic vibe.Compared to Firaxis' XCOM this definitely feels like an older game. It's more complex, much more challenging outside of ground combat. In XCOM you basically only need to worry about ground combat. In Xenonauts you have to maintain multiple bases, multiple teams of soldiers, cast a wide enough net of radars to protect as much of the earth as you can, and manage your air force against the waves of UFOs that even threaten to attack your bases if left unharassed (and if they do they aliens will come in and try to break all your stuff). And all that before you even get to the ground combat. Both games feature similar research that provides gear that you need to stay on even keel with the aliens who get progressively more powerful, and the research also drives the story along in both. Though Xenonauts doesn't really have a story in the way the XCOM does, in Xenonauts the narrative is your own, there's no cutscenes or dialogue or anything.The ground combat is also much more complex in Xenonauts, choosing to use ""time units"" rather than XCOM's two actions per soldier method. Most weapons have several firing modes available taking different amounts of time units, switching weapons (or grenades) takes time units, etc. Also cover much always always always be used, a soldier left in the middle of the street is liable to get shot by an alien you can't see.One major gripe I have with Xenonauts' ground combat is that downed UFOs only have one way in, the front door. This means you have to funnel your troops in through the front door where a bunch of well armed aliens are sitting waiting violate you. The combat requires well thought out tactics in order to survive, and yet you're forced to charge headlong at angry aliens, ehhhh.On the whole, Xenonauts is a more calculating, complex, slower paced game. XCOM is snappier and more gamey. They both offer a different approach to the alien invasion. Xenonauts is a more niche take to XCOM's mainstream accessibility. Personally, while I recommend this game to XCOM fans or fans of tactical strategy type games, I don't know how much more I can withstand, it's very stressful. It's always heartbreaking to lose your elite guys in XCOM, but in Xenonauts I just keep losing everything, game's hard man!			"

												Review:An almost perfect game, especially if your looking for a game like the classic XCOM.  Unfortunatly there are not really any others these days so this game definitely fills the void.  Yeah it has some problems and a few glitches here and there such as an alien, rarely, being able to get that shot off through a wall killing a guy but with the same line of sight back you cant shoot them.  It is rare but it does happen.  The main difference between this game and the classic XCOM is that Xenonauts uses a 2D system rather than the 3D one XCOM: Ufo Defense had.  This has its limitations and is probably the biggest gripe I have with this game because it makes the line of sight issues, among other things.  It calculates the chance of hit, does the math, and then either hits or misses the target while cover dramatically reduces that chance.  This is opposed to XCOM's 3D engine where it instead used a complex calculation with the accuracy taken into account and calculated a trajectory of the bullet and whatever it hit it hit, whether it be a guy way off the side of the target, hitting the guy behind the target, or just flying off the map.  It was much more fun that way, with this game their system is ok but definitely a step back.  On the bright side I hear Goldhawk is using a 3D engine for their sequel so hopefully the next game is going to be the true successor to this genre.Pros:+Great Graphics (for the style they are going for)+Air battles are intense+Streamlined management (you still have to manufacture all the weapons besides the base ones, armour, planes, ect. except the ammo)  +Loadouts. You still have to account for how much ammo you bring, grenades, and everything of that nature with penalties if you bring too much.+Soldiers are now much easier to track (very powerful feature, something XCOM lacked in and you'll understand why when you play it)+Tons of tech+Cover mechanics are great but again I just wish it was a 3D engine+Has room for alot of strategy and different methods of play+Great community and many mods to change your experienceCons:-2D engine which accounts for most of the issues people have with line of sight and accuracy.  It isn't bad but the 3D engine would have been 100x better.  This is my biggest gripe with the game and is mainly the reason I feel the game isn't perfect (otherwise it would have been!)-Most other negative issues relate to the 2D issue such as not being able to through granades over walls, shoot someone in the air if their is a wall in the way, and other annoying little things like that.-Usually each map will have only 1 race of alien, sometimes 2 if they are similar, such as both being robotic for instance.  Theres a mod that changes that but thought it was worth mentioning.Last Thoughts:Personally I did not mind that my dudes would usually get 1-2 shotted as it adds to the difficulty, and for me the realism.  I can't immagine someone would take a few shots from a plasma gun, especially at close range, and keep chugging through like nothing happened.  It is manageable though, and if played right usually the casaulties can stay pretty low.  Also the game is pretty brutal and challenging, you always feel behind.  This game is all about trade offs.  Overall a great foundation for the sequel, but still alot of fun.  Great job Goldhawk amigos!If it had a 3D engine would be 9.5, but alas8.5/10			"

												After several failed playthroughs and one completed all the way through the campaign, I have to say, GG Goldhawk Interactive for this game and their Xenonauts 2 Demo. Plays great, deep strategy, replayability, and a workshop to spice things up. Not to mention Community Edition. Overall, plays like old X-COM and generally feels old school. Well worth the full price.P.S This games needs the ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" Award, because I feel it is underrated in comparison to X-COM, and other strategy games.

												Many many years ago i was a big fan of the first UFO:Enemy Unknown and its sequel Terror from the Deep. I loved these games and played them for weeks and months. Some time later i came across the inofficial ""sequels"", Aftermath, Afterlight and Aftershock...but didn´t get comfortable with them. The foot prints of their unequaled predecessor where too big. The graphics, the gameplay...it has not been what i want an UFO-title to be.The newly released XCOM and XCOM2 dont felt right for me too, so i gave the open sourced UFO:Alien Invasion (UFO:AI) a try but as well, thats not what i expected to seeBy accident i found Xenonauts on Steam and was very curious about it. After something about 6 hours of gameplay i only can recommend this title to anyone, who wants a modern version of the original series.For me, an UFO-title does not need to have fancy top-notch 3D graphics, its all about gameplay and story. And there, Xenonauts does very well. I feel comfortable from the first time the UI is started. The gameplay is very similar to the original series, geo- and battlescape usage is self explanatory and straight forward. You´ll get familiar with it within minutes. The graphics even add to the atmosphere, they are modernized but not for the sake of having the best 3d graphics out there...they just feel right the way they are.For a long time, Xenonauts is the first UFO-type game i´m playing that makes me sorry about every soldier i loose in a battle. Exactly that is what i wan´t a UFO-title to be. Great work!			"

												A pretty impressive reimagining of the original x-com.  A little repetitive in places, the bases could be more frequent and the UFO spawns less scripted, but it gets the nostalgia feeling with smart updates to the original formula.			"

												I have never played any of the previous XCOM games. I just want people who also haven't to know that about me up front.My experience with Xenonauts has been excellent. This is an addictive game that will have you hooked with that 'JUST ONE MORE TURN' addiction that all good games have. I highly recommend this game to any turn-based strategy fan. Before I go any further, if you decide to play this game, you NEED to play it on Ironman mode; that's what makes this game so great. It's a mode where you aren't allowed to save-scum, so all of your actions, and mistakes, are permanent.I consider myself fairly well versed on turn-based strategy games. I'm a 31 year old gamer who has very fond childhood memories of early strategy games like Shining Force, Dark Wizard, Final Fantasy Tactics, OgreBattle, Civilization, Heros of M&M, as well as more modern strategy games like Disgaea. I enjoyed and still enjoy every single one of them, but none have made me feel quite the way that Xenonauts does.This is how Xenonauts goes: Pick your starting base, outfit your soldiers with various weapons such as shotguns, RPGs, grenades, riot shields, and sniper rifles based on their stats, send your planes out to intercept UFOs that come within range of your base(s), send out a strike team to recover the downed UFO, use strategy and tactics to successfully eliminate all of the aliens, recover alien artifacts, weapons, etc, get back on the dropship and return home. Have your scientists research new technologies based on the alien artifacts you find, then have your engineers build them using the materials you've recovered in battle. Equip your troops with better weapons and armor so they can deal with increasingly dangerous alien footsoldiers, build faster, more powerful aircrafts to deal with increasingly dangerous alien ships, build tanks to give your troops support in fights, defend your base from attacking UFOs, send out troops to defend cities that are under attack, and send troops in to demolish alien bases. You are trying to keep the various nations around the globe happy. The more you engage and successfully deter alien attacks within their airspace, the more money they will pay you. Ignore a region for a while, and they may give up on the Xenonauts program entirely.The battles will sometimes have you deliberating on a single action for several minutes if there is a lot at stake. You find yourself in a precarious situation. Should you bumrush the alien hope you shotgun it to death before it reacts? Should you stay where you are and lob a grenade, hoping you blow it up? Should you retreat back to safety, allowing the alien to do the same? The AI isn't stupid. Most of the aliens are going to engage you stragically, hiding behind cover, around corners, running when surrounding, throwing grenades when your troops are clumped up. They aren't going to come rushing at you while you hide behind sandbags, allowing themselves to be mowed down. They want YOU to come to them. And they have better technology and sometimes greater numbers. You really have to be patient with this game. You go out there running and gunning at the aliens and I'm certain you will not be successful for very long.The core of the game is the strategic ground battles, of course, but there is strategy at all levels in this game. Money is a big one. You are never going to be able to afford everything you want until maybe the very end of the game. Are you going to build more bases to cover more land? You will certainly need to, but the timing is up to you. Are you going to be able to afford a whole new platoon of troops for that new base? Interceptors? Defense missiles? New bases take up a significant portion of your money. Should you hire more scientists so that you can research new technologies faster? Those scientists cost $10,000 per person per month... and you need to build barracks to house them. Ditto with Engineers, but you'll need more to build more advanced weapons ships and armor. Recently had a battle that went really poorly? You're going to have to hire new soldiers, and help them succeed in battle to gain experience/stats. You have to be smart with your money in this game. Strategic.New technologies take time to research, and more time to build. You need to prioritize. Should you research better weapons or armor first? Is it worth the time researching and building that tank? Should you build that new interceptor now? Do you really need it NOW or can you use the time/money on something else? Should you prioritize new warplanes so that you can protect the nations that fund you? Or should you focus on weapons and armor so that you can raise the survival rate of your troops, making them more experienced and efficient over time? Should you focus on tanks that will draw fire away from your troops, increasing soldier survivability? Should you outfit one soldier with a riot shield? Two? Three? Four? How many RPGs? How many assault rifles? Does your base really need that many missile batteries, or is it just 'nice'?The answers to all of these questions is: Balance. You will need to do everything, ultimately, but you need to prioritize and plan for the short and long term. You'll need to take calculated risks, whether it's in battle or with money. You'll need to make sacrifices (Sure, you'd love to have that 3rd base up NOW, but can you truly afford it now? Or are you risking losing a whole region's funding?). Unlike the games I've mentioned above, you can't do everything in this game. This is not a game where you fight a battle, win, go to the next town, revive your people, buy all the latest equipment and head to the next battle. You can't revive your troops, and you can't simply buy the new equipment you want, because a) you have to research and build everything from scratch, there are no stores, and b) you don't have the money to buy everything anyway. As I said, the strategy is at all levels in this game, and each level affects the others. Balancing all of this is your key to being successful.So what makes Xenonauts special? Ironmade mode. With it, there is a sense of desperation and panic that you will sometimes experience. You are going to take losses. Your strategies aren't always going to work. Plans are going to go awry. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to shake your head, kick yourself, and have regrets. If you're playing on ironman mode, as I HIGHLY recommend, you don't get to reload your last save and save that soldier. He's dead. Forever. That tank that got blown up is gone forever. If you fail an alien terror mission, that city gets wiped from the face of the Earth and you lose significant funding. But maybe you had to retreat from that mission because you were getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you? Maybe things didn't go so well, and you decided that the loss in funding was better than losing all of your experienced soldiers and the expensive equipment they were carrying. Sometimes the game feels 'cheap'. Sometimes you will get sniped by an alien you can't even see. One hit KO'd behind cover, soldier gone forever. You didn't even make a mistake. It's a situation you'd have to be clairvoyant to prevent. The aliens are more advanced than you, afterall. They're going to have better weapons and armor. But Xenonauts's shining moments come when you overcome those failures, setbacks, and mistakes. When all the chips are on the table and you're outgunned and outnumbered and you still emerge victorious, although not nearly unscathed. When you are attacking an alien base and half your squad gets wiped out by a grenade thrown from around the corner but you still somehow win. When you're down to your last clip of ammo and half the map is blown up in an alien terror mission and your last two soldiers barely kill the last alien. THAT is what makes this game great.This game makes me feel a way that no other strategy game ever has. And it is EXTREMELY rewarding.			"

												Xenonauts certainly is an old fashioned game primarily for original X-COM fans. Graphics are somewhat outdated (though lovaly drawn) but it may even be for the best. I would go as far as to say that it's better than original X-COM. At the very least in terms of lore (which is fantastic) and plot. Plus Intercepting minigame is actually useful and fun and various types of weapons and armor make tactics more diverse. Flat earth with perfect circle coverage form radar dishes nearby poles gives me creeps but at least I don't have to struggle with full general stores anymore.But really it's pretty much the same old X-COM: UFO Defense updated and expanded. I highly recommend.No psyonics for your squad though.			"

												Rather than write a long and somewhat scattershot review of the game I'll just say that it's excellent. It's tense and challenging. You'll see soldiers distinguish themselves in combat in terrible situations, and you'll see your vets get killed when things go sideways. You'll have to juggle the competing priorities of the air war and the ground war (hint: focus on the air war) since you can only build so much expensive stuff at once. The only glitches/bugs that really bothered me got patched (timing of bleed damage, Harridan snipers glitching into walls, berserking) and there really wasn't anything else that I feel has gone unresolved. Great game, just know that it's much more complicated than the Firaxis XCOM and will take you a lot longer to finish.			"

												THE GOOD:  This one is absolutely the spiritual successor to the original X-COM title from the mid-90s.  The avoid a bunch of the RPG gimmicks from the new X-COM games, and leave you with what is much more of a squad-based, turn-based strategy war game.  The atmosphere of the game is very well done, the various game mechanics and combat mechanics are very well balanced (e.g., finding the right balance in base-building between research/industry and defensive coverage of the map, finding the right balance in reserach between ground-based weapons and beefing up your interceptors, etc.).  And the nail-biting tension around losing your squad in battles was exactly the same!It  took me right back to the days of playing the original X-COM, and that is high praise indeed!There is also a small but very enthusiastic modding community for this game, so check out the Steam Workshop.THE BAD:  I found it a little bit of a grind later on in the game.  Too many repetitive base assaults, too many repetitive missions to ""kill and autopsy"" or ""capture and interrogate"" one more unfamiliar alien, and the formula of ""capture this type of alien"" to advance the main story line got a bit stale after a while.  That was after 60+ hours of delightful game play, so take that with a grain of salt.			"

The goodXenonauts atcheaves what it set out to do: To be a spiritual succsessor to the first Xcom game.It has improved in some aspects over the original Xcom: The aircraft combat is less random and more skill based with its up to 3 v 3 air battles where you actually get to controll          the positioning and weapon useage of your aircraft. As opposed to the original where it was mostly luck based wheter your interceptors hit and/or/did not get hit in an encounter.The art in the xenopedia/ufopedia is what I personally enjoied alot in both the original and Xenonauts.  Combat shields are a great addition to the game.The modding scene is still active and people are givig their best to make the game better.The badFlatland! The geoscape is flat and radar ranges and distances make no geological sense because there is no consideration for map deformation. If you like globes you will not find any here.The ground combat sprites look plane, like they made some models in a 3d art program and animated them there. Then made a bunch of low resolution images of the models to make the art for the ground combat. The art there has no character at all unlike the original Xcom. Unlike the original Xcom you can not make your soldiers or aleans: Jump down from roofs. Throw anything besides granades and explosives. Wake up from being uncouncious. Get tired from running. Take kontroll of the minds of aleans or civilians. Get hit in specific body parts and and lose apropreat stats for being wounded.Difficult to make mods for: The game engine is at best a derelict wreck with no source. It reports no errors and just crashes when things go wrong. Wich makes finding bugs in your mods way more difficult than it has to be. Due  to the difficulitys in the games development the game is in numerous separate peaces of code that use different files for tha same things. For example the weapon stats in the xenopedia/ufopedia and inventory and ground combat calculations are all in different files. While making a new weapon for the game you have to mod all three of the files witch all have slightly different formats.ConclusionsA polished game it certainly is not. But for the price they are asking it has sertainly given me many houers of entertainmant. And many of its smaller flaws, exept the ones I mentioned, have been fixed by the modders. So if you are looking for something a bit more like the old Xcom yo might want to give this game a try. But if you are short on money you might want to save up for the seqel.			"

I love how it stayed true to the original, but it managed to streamline the tedious parts, such as ammo management. I just wish that increasing the difficulty would improve the AI instead of improving alien stats, but that's what most of the games do anyway.I can't wait to see the sequel.			"

												Xenonauts is exactly what i was looking for, a updated and generally better imo version of the old xcom games. The 1970's feel of the game is excellent and the game is extremly fun in all stage. Base building, squaid outfittign and build the aerial combat and of course ground missions. One thing is that the difficulty ramps up rather quick at a certain point and its hard to catch up if you fall behind. Of course that is the genre but rather frustrating all the same.Overall id rate it at 8/10 and reccomend a purchase			"

												A fantastic successor to the original X-Com, and the most true to its roots. This is a different experience from the 2K remake XCOM titles, but just as good in different ways. Highly recommend the Community Edition mod for newcomers and returning player alike, and good luck!			"

												I'm playing the community edition, which polishes up some of the mechanics.  This game is pretty solid, and well thought out.  The geoscape and air combat feel pretty authentic, and that alone sets this apart from the new XCOM.  The ground combat is tedious, but in a good way.  I'm constantly counting my TUs trying to decide when to run up to an alien to blast their face off with a shotgun, and when I pull it off, it is extremely satisfying.The CE maps are challenging even in the early game, and this game doesn't ease you into the mechanics as much as XCOM did.  I play this game on normal difficulty, and I'm not ashamed to save scum because sometimes I still take dead soldiers at the end of a mission if the trade off was worth it.  That's because the risks and rewards in this game are balanced, and the progression is logical.  I'd reccomend this game if you like spending an hour planning every 5 minutes of action.			"

Early Access Review
								This is by far the best atempt to a remake of the original x-com: enemy unknown / x-com ufo defense.This game catch the intensity and the scope of research and development of new technologies, aswell as government and economic relations.A must have for every fan of the original X-Com games, for nostalgic reason or just because, you just aswell as I, still play thoes godly good games, from a time when programmers knew how to make something special and new.Everything since then has mostly ben remakes or copy of base code and editing graphics to make something look diferent from an original perspective.This is not just another remake, its a realy good remake, but I'll still play the original's eventually from time to time aswell.

												Great game! It's a good one for whose who want a game in where you need to actually think and feel challenged. It""s fundamental to have stategies, and if you go out playing recklessly, you'll definately lose soldiers, vehicles and bases. There's a whole width of things that you can do, strategies that you can take, approaches that you can make! It's a game that you look for the gameplay, not for the graphs or something. If you like strategy games, go for it and don't think twice! It's totally worth the price.			"

												This is a good alternate Xcom game.  The community based mod is excellent, and really enhances the game as well.  I played this game for hours in vanilla.  Then I played it again for hours with the mod.  If you are a diehard Xcom: UFO defense fan, then this game is just for you.  It isn't as pretty as XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but it has more research content than Enemy Unknown.  If you get the community addons, well, you just found your favorite XCOM game.  I prefer less flashy too, so older computers can easily run this.			"
