												As a spin-off Holy Avatar vs... stays true to the formula presented by Grotesque Tactics: That is, it is a light-hearted and funny Strategy RPG. As with GT this one refers to many popular games and laughs are around every corner. The major difference from the main series however, is the fact that the player this time controls ""his semidevine humble self Holy Avatar"" directly on his quest to rid his holiday island from a zombie maiden infested plague.Gameplay wise, this game keeps it simple. The story and progression is linear most of the time. Only when one is mid-way through the story, order of completing some quests becomes optional.The battle system will be immediately familiar and proofs to be not very deep. It is clearly not aiming for hardcore S-RPG players, which means even below-average skilled players like me can win the battles and enjoy the story.In the end I can recommend this one to everybody who enjoyed GT 1 & 2, because you will definitely have a good time here.The same goes for newcomers who are looking for a parody of popular games and familiar gaming cliches. Just don't expect too much of challenge!!			"

												I'm a bit on the fence about recommending this in general... but as far as continuing the series goes, this game is fit for fans of the first 2 games. It is exactly what you would expect in the GT series (humor and all things considered).The only difference is that the game is much shorter than the other 2 and way more linear.Here are a few observations:- The environment is a lot more vibrant thanks to the cell shading and the tropical theme. It's a shame that the game was so short.- Not much has changed as far as the hud/interface goes. I expected a more refined design seeing as this is the 3rd game in the series.- The game was too easy. Even with the difficulty slider, there's not a huge leap in content difficulty.As you can see, I don't have a lot to say about the game. It was just way too short in my opinion. As I already mentioned, this game brings more of the same from the first 2 games. That's why despite the not so awesome review, I can still strongly recommend it to people who liked and completed the other games in the series.			"

""Sunglasses and babes on a tropical island""Holy Avatar? - Holy s***  this man is sexistic and political incorrect.The dark humor of this game is strange, but also unique. Imagine him coming back with three of his favourite girlfriends to Holy Island to relax, which is a tropical island full of virgin slaves, goblins and elfes. First decision: Put on your red hot swimsuits and help me fighting the deadly hugging lovebears. So far so good. Who's this guy with long blonde hair growing til his back, bearded + dark sunglasses? Idk but somehow he's is very, very cool. Ah yes the story begins, when some of the island virgins transform into blood greedy zombies. But how worse the situation will come and people are really dying here ... Holy Avatar has everytime a good story to tell or laughing about the stupidity of his virgin friends. There's a lot of cliche and accidently sexy moments happening during the story. Do you like giggeling babes that you must protect with your life? And they are so grateful to you ...			"

												If Duke Nukem got his own RPG set in a fantasy world in the mid 00's, this would be it.More stereotyping of demographics than Tumblr, less pop culture references than Magicka, and sexual innuendo on-par with a Louis C.K. skit. Still had fun, for what it's worth. Cheap voice actors probably would have helped immensely.Only bother if you desperately want a shallow, simple RPG to kill a few hours (and even then I'm sure there are many other, better options out there.)

												Holy Avatar vs. Maidens of the Dead is developed by Headup Games and Silent Dreams while being published by Headup Games. It’s less of a sequel and more of a spin-off that provides the entire trilogy a closing note as crazy as the series’ initial premise. GameplayUnlike Grotesque Tactics 1&2, you no longer take control of Drake, the goth wannabe knight. Shifting the focus from him and onto the trilogy’s true protagonist: His semi divine humble Self, The Holy Avatar. This paladin of nearly antihero status is once again a literal running joke and a tasteful parody addressed to that particular typecast within western fantasy role playing games. If the first two games in the series addressed tropes and somewhat genre conventional locations such as forests and dungeons, in Holy Avatar vs. Maidens of the Dead, the aforementioned protagonist is apparently on a tropical island vacation, sporting obvious sandy beaches, palm trees and…zombies? Indeed the game takes a few jabs at the Dead Island franchise, more or less subtlely. As far as the gameplay formula is concerned, the entire trilogy has been fairly standardized with very little room for streamlining. In truth, the turn based combat was only a tad sloppy in the first part, since Grotesque Tactics 2 used a far more responsive game engine which is found in a slightly modified iteration in HAvsMD as well. Outside of fighting, the rest of the game is standard RPG, with all the mechanics you’re probably accustomed to already. Inventory, multiple choice conversations and map navigation by either point ‘n click or by keyboard. Camera rotation is by default turned off, but I had to fiddle with that setting and turn it back on. Here’s how you can do it yourself: Go to Documents/Holy Avatar vs Maiden of the Dead/Settings folder, open config.xml with Notepad and change “CamCanRotate” from false to true. Apparently the camera was locked into place to give the game map more utility. Why not use both? The game seemed a bit more liniar than its predecessors, so it’s not like you can get lost without constantly keeping an eye on the map.Taking nearly a three year hiatus after the release of Grotesque Tactics 2 – Dungeons and Donuts, in Holy Avatar vs. Maidens of the Dead we have expanded game engine assets and even a different general look. I’ve always been a fan of cel shading in video games (Jet Set Radio was the first commercially successful title to use it, but the Borderlands series has made it truly popular) since it’s an art style reminiscent of comic books and also a well deserved break from “regular” 3D. I’m glad Silent Dreams opted for this approach and I hope they may explore it further in any future project they might consider releasing on Steam. What I didn’t really like, was the lack of English voce acting, the game giving you two options: either accept the German dubs or receive the silent treatment and just read the (error-free) English subtitles. Of course I opted for the voices as well, even if I can’t understand nearly 90% of what they are yapping about. If I could enjoy the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series with Russian dubs, I’m sure that German can’t be that bad either. This might be an important lesson for all gamers out there. Learn to appreciate diversity and embrace the English subs, but don’t neglect the dubs either, even if you couldn’t understand a single word of what they’re saying on-screen. Pros+ Beautiful cel-shaded graphics+ As amusing as the first two parts in the series+ Steam Achievements Cons- Only German voice acting (with subtitles in English)- Feels more liniar than the previous two- No Steam Trading CardsResult / Final thoughtsGive this spin-off a chance to entertain you and it will. Who knows, perhaps you’ll even learn a new word in German or two! In all seriousness though, the game is worth purchasing separately or as part of the Grotesque Tactics Complete Pack. It’s been quite a ride and even if I haven’t finished them yet I’m sure the clever use of satire, leaves few chances for boredom to set in, if at all.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.

												I was actually pretty surprised at this game. I thought I would be immediately put off around five minutes into playtime, but I found myself quite surprised by it. While this certainly isn't the best game out there, it's got it's own unique charm - that I believe - should be given a chance.I found the characters to be refreshing. They aren't super complex or deep, the opposite really, but I think it plays to it's strength. The main character is self-centered, misogynistic, and completely oblivious to it. The 'love' interest is flighty and hangs on the main characters every word, despite having to do his bidding - even at her own expense. There are a ton of pop culture references in the game if you are familiar with them. (Things like that always tickle my fancy.) And the dialogue, while pretty limited, is pretty endearing. The graphics aren't anything to write home about, but I've found that because the environment is bright, made it pleasing for me to play.Now this doesn't mean that there weren't a few things that didn't bug me. There were. Like how the camera liked to fly away when I moved my mouse. Or how certain dialogue no longer appeared in a box - which made it hard to follow. Then there was one point where there was a battle with scripted dialogue, but I moved and killed something before the scripted actions finished - effectively leaving me stuck and making me reload. Text will automatically scroll fast in the beginning until you change the speed. But none of this was actually enough to stop me from finishing.So to be super honest, this game - while enjoyable - is definitely what I call a 'one and done'. So once you finish, you probably won't play it again. So I advise to not buy it at full price; wait until a sale.			"

												Despite some awkard controls and low frame rates (despite the fact that my system is pretty darned fast), this is a fun RPG. The tile-based, turn-based combat is satisfying. The characters are charming and fun, despite and because of their silly dialog. Not a bad way to spend a few dollars.			"

Posted: September 25, 2014
												This is a spoilerfree review of a complete playthrough of the german version of the game, played with keyboard and mouse. Man I would love reccomending this game. I loved the first two grotesque tactics games. As soon as I saw this I immediatly bought it. The main problem with the game is, that there is less everything. Basically this game is, what the first ( maybe the first two) chapter in one of the first two games is. Only that the first two games had a bunch of chapters coming after that. It has fewer characters (barely any actually), fewer quests/places to go to, way fewer items and is extremely short in general. This is basially a DLC and not a game. Whats worst though, is that the humor this time falls flat. Where usually there was dark humor and many references to pop culture, now there still is a bit of that left but just a tiny bit and the jokes are basically sexist/blonde jokes, which can be funny and only offensive to really sensible people if you do it right, but they didnt do it right. The jokes are performed so clumsily that its hard to give anyone more than a grin at best. Now if this was only 2 dollars I'd say go ahead and take it if you are a fan of the series, since the few characters that you use are still the ones you know and love and a tiny bit of story unfolds itself which might interest you, but for the price it is at right now I can only say stay away, its not worth it.P.S: If you havent played the other games yet this game is just confusing and totally not worth your money on any sale.

												This is kind of like an epilogue to Grotesque Tactics 2, as it is only about a 3-4 hour game and uses the same graphics, combat, and UI for the most part (they gave it more of an island/vine look) as that game along with a few of the same NPCs though there are some new ones too and there are a few new enemies. It is still fun but because it is shorter I would keep that in mind when considering a purchase. Unlike Grotesque Tactics 1-2 where you had a party of 6-10 characters, in this game you max out at 3 and none of them are new if you played GT 1-2. Also know that at least at the time of release/this review, there was no English audio, only German; I know they are hoping to add English though at some point and it is listed in the options menu, but tells you that it is not currently available. Of course there is English text, and there were some humorous parts; as long as you don't expect it to be as in-depth as GT 1-2 and think of it more as a short adventure episode/epilogue then I don't think you will be disappointed.

												I still have yet to play the previous Grotesque Tactics games, although this title is apparently considered a spin-off.That being said, anyone who has played the previous games will recognize the Holy Avatar straight away - he is front and center as the main attraction this time around. As the mightiest of heroes, you embark upon a much deserved vacation to a remote island with a small entourage of personal maidens. Things quickly escalate from there, however, and you soon find yourself amidst another hair-brained adventure.For anyone unfamiliar with the series - Grotesque Tactics is a parody RPG franchise that hails from Germany, with two previous entries. Similar to these past games, HAvsMotD combines isometric camera angles with a colorful 3D world full of whit and humor. The actual RPG aspects are surprisingly solid, though nothing especially complex of course. Hotbars, Combat Abilities, Skill Trees - all the usual suspects are present; plus, plenty of shiny loots to loot and sexy maidens to rescue! For combat, the old 'turn-based grid movement' formula is in effect.All in all, well worth it's price and then some!			"

Completed in 6 hours with all achievements. The humor was ok, but I laughed a lot more with GT1 and GT2. Overall I can't say I was disappointed, but this third episode was  a ""lite"" version of the previous ones. I suggest to buy it on sale, 10Eur is too much for what will you get. 3/5			"

												I had misgivings about this entry to the Grotesque Tactics series because of my dislike of the main character. These were relieved by in-game dialogue, though I do have to agree with Holy Avatar and the entire party on one character. Holy Avatar vs. Maidens of the Dead (or Grotesque Tactics 2.5, in my opinion) is great if you like games that break the fourth wall, and enjoy seeing references to popular culture. While it is much shorter than Evil Heroes or Dungeons & Donuts, it ties up a few loose ends all the way back to Evil Heroes, while leaving some plot holes gaping open. At least Holy doesn't forget people when he gets Hero's Amnesia. Sweet Violence tied the whole thing together. I kind of miss Ed, but he does have a major mobility problem.			"

												First impression after about an hour: Good, unique, fun.I'll update as I go, but so far I'm wondering why I waited so long to play it (bought it on sale, lingered).I'd call it lighthearded PG-13 parody.  I've chuckled a couple times already and already seen jokes referencing Ultima and Zelda and the RPG male fantasy.  It's already worth the pittance I paid for it.  The combat is turn-based, it's not XCOM complicity, more traditional rpg style (with jokes, level-up after one monster?).  The initial monsters are kinda funny and well animated (the art style is pretty good so far).  I'm currently fighting care bears (by another name) that snuggle you to death and monkeys throwing coconuts from trees and ko'ing me (just had to load).			"

												Holy Avatar vs Maidens of the Dead is the hilarious spin off to ""grotesque tactics""Most partymembers of the grotesque titles have an appearance in this spin off. (sadly drake is not there)This time you play the mighty halfgod HolyAvatar himself, this alone is worth the 10$/€ pricetag.As it is a spin off: it has about 4-6 hours playtime (original ones had ~10h-14h)The story is hilarious as the other parts and has the same quality overall filled with jokes (most fun as always: the german original version, although there is no english sound in this one so that might make not that much of an difference this time ^-^)This Spin off is way ""easier"" (although some mobs realy hit harder so the fights themselves are more or less the same)  and shorter than the previous titles, then again it is just a game for its story and its holy avatarishness.(For example after every fight your characters get resurrected and heal hp, mana, and their skills (as well as ultimates) reset. Thats why the game, after you got the ultimate skills has a huge powerspike for you and you can actually kill everything realy quick running from mobs to mobs without delay of having to heal, which makes it easier.I so hope there will come a Grotesque Tactics 3 soon.So im gonna finish this review quickly, else i will get eaten by zombies for writing a review/critic (although nothing to say bad about). ^-^ [gamers who played the game will get it]HolyAvatar/10  (10/10 actually although the original series is better)For those who the price tag appears to be too high, wait for a sale and best get the whole series.

												THe writing really isn't brilliant as advertised. It's kinda cool that they are parodying the seriousness of fantasy rpgs (again) but it's far more silly than witty. It's also quite hard to make out many of the background conversations as the text boxes are tiny and disappear very quickly. Voice acting would have helped.The fighting at the beginning is very tedious (before you get more advanced skills). And then when you get the better skills the game is over very soon after so don't get to use them much. I finished the game with characters only on lvl9/10 so hadn't upgraded much.I think the previous Grotesque tactics games are better so if you are on the fence about this one, get the bundle.I'd give this a 5/10. It's not terrible. There are a lot worse games out there, but also a lot better. Something like Blackguards fo example if you want to stick to this genre.			"

												Loved the first 2 games of the series (Grotesque Tactics). Sadly Drake is not in this one, so no contrast as Holy is the only ""main character"" in here. But most of all it isn't working very well. No map other than the minimap, so i constantly forgot in which direction i had to run (through 2 other zones) to get to the zone i needed to be for some quest. No indication if you have completed a quest objective and should run back to the quest giver, if you remember who that was.And i couldn't find a quest item i needed to get any further, as i already killed the ones who were supposed to drop it on one of my ""where am i supposed to go now""-walks. (Tevez' flower)Maybe there would have been some way to get them to spawn again, but i didn't find one and had no patience to play the last 3-4 hours a second time.Buy the other 2 games, this one you can skip without missing out on something great.

												This is almost like a side quest to Grotesque Tactics 2 than a game.  It's too short (about 4 hours,) too easy (free heal after every battle.)  But still, it's hard to complain when it showed up in my library for free.5/10Actually, this marks my 200th 100%, so yay.			"

												ok so this is a spin off of the tactics game where its holy avatar and a few maidens. so if you played the others you know that the humor is subjective and some of it is really cheesy. sure holy avatar can be annoying at times. the music does repeat itself so that can also tend to be annoying.its a very short game. as a few said you can look at it as a dlc and some pointed the music is similar to monkey island. so that annoying camera bug is still there but its not as bad as the first one. so sometimes it will just keep going when you only wanted it to go a little distance. i also experienced it crashing just like the first one did. i don't know if that was a common problem or just me.yes there are references in this game such as army of darkness and a few others. as the current game stands i can't recommend it. if you do still want to pick it up do it on sale or bundle. its not worth the full price.

												As a Grotesque Tactics spin-off, in a a nutshell, it's basically the cream of the crap cherry-picked from every RPG - and a few other genres - ever. You know, the arrogant hero (looking a bit the Duke, called a bit the Avatar), the omnipresent female bikini armor, the pointlesssly drawn out fights, the stupid skill trees, and because it's all the rage, it's zombies that are attacking!And all that is packaged in satire. Bt it's not packaged particularly well. The humor overemphasizes sexist tropes (referencing Builder Bob can't save that overall impression), and the gameplay is so bad it is simply bad (the necesssary omni-backstabbing is a drag). Okay, the audio isn't too shabby if Sie verstehen Deutsch, but the game's length, now there's a killer joke. I'm not sure I could even have made 4 hours if I hadn't simul-surfed in another window...Bottom line, this thing is not worth it at regular price. There's boatloads of $10 indie games that may not be satire, but are more fun. If you want to see what Grotesque is about, stick to the main games.			"

												It's bad... real bad.The main menu barely functions; I can only save if I click the middle slots, no others. The humor is fairly weak- it get's pretty old to read ""his humble semi-devine self"" for the 50th time, especially when the text pops up off screen... Speaking of which, the camera is unbelievably bad as well so you're constantly scrolling around to see anything. The fights are easy and monotonous. "

												Im so very disappointed with this game. I briefly skimmed over the reviews ""“His semidevine humble self is in it!”  -2 thumbs up – Holy Avatar"" Little did I notice it was the in game characters giving their own ""review"" view on this terrible game.The mouse feels unresponsive, the combat is incredibly slow, the turn based combat makes the combat painfully slower!The game may be witty but as far as I have played it has been more of a half wit humour. Needless to say Im very disappointed, seems next time I should do better research than skim over self reviews by the game designers.			"

												I'm not usually tech deficient, but I cannot get this game to run. I have a 3 monitor setup and it opens half off the screen on one of my side monitors in such a way that its immovable and unplayable.Yea, I could probably just change my display setup and run it on a single monitor...but I got this game in a bundle back during summer sale, and it just doesn't seem worth it.So, if you have a multi monitor setup, be advised before purchasing that this game may require changing some settings to get it to run.

												I have to change my original review from thumbs up to thumbs down.  After a few hours one of my characters got bugged, and now has -47 strength. That means she can't even move during combat, let alone attack.  Changing equipment doesn't help, and usually makes it worse.  I consider this to be gamebreaking and a deal-breaker.   It's a shame, because I was liking the game up until then.  Glad I got it cheap.  I'd recommend avoiding this one.			"

												Absolutely awful. I didn't expect much, given my prior experiences with Grotesque Tactics, but geez, how do these games make it past the QA department? Oh, right. There isn't one.Besides the rampant 80's style misogyny, which hey, I can overlook, the text crawls off the top whiz by without prompting as if the devs themselves can't be bothered to read it. Then you are thrust into a semi cel-shaded, kinda 3D isometric world that looks like a garage sale threw up on screen. I wouldn't mind that so much either if it weren't for the fact that moving around is like stumbling drunkebly through a house of mirrors.Alright that's all I have patience for writing about this. Even if you love the art style and think the jokes are funny, this is a grindy, run-of-the-mill RPG. Save your money.			"

												Unsurprisingly this game is as inherenly misogynistic as you might think.  But it's pretty upfront about that so it isn't even the game's worst sin - the worst sin at the the controls are clunky, and the player interaction with the system is incredibly shallow.  Even if the blatant objectifaction is not a problem for you, the terrible game play will be.Avoid.			"
