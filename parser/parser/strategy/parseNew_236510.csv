												""Meet the game that brings back the tactical FPS shooter""...When in development this game promised to bring back the tactical shooter. It brought it back but not in a good way. There are so many problems with this game. It is a buggy mess. Gameplay is: Peak around corner, shoot dumb enemy. Move to next room. Peak around another corner, shoot enemy. Move to next room, peak around corner and get shot. Take control of team mate. Move to next room, crash due to game ruining bug... Haha fun isn't it?Good stuff:-Made me excited when seeing for first time.Bad stuff: -Made me cry when playing for the first time.-Customisation doesn't work.-Bad A.I.-Glitchy mess.-Boring.-Overpriced (devs should pay you to play).-Doesn't work.- I could go on for an hour about how bad this is. -2/10			"

												Takedown: Red Sabre was supposed to revive the tactical shooter genre but it failed miserably after the publisher forced the developers to release the game before it was anywhere near finished. The game had initially gotten over $221,000 from Kickstarter supporters but the final product wasn't anything like the developers had envisioned. This game was launched before it was anywhere near completed, by the company's own admission, in a cash grab by the publisher. Do not buy it. The company has moved on to new projects like Epsilon and this game is no longer supported, meaning that the developers do not intend to release further patches or content for it.A summary of the situation is below.

												Do you like ultra hardcore realistic tactical shooters that border on masochistic, giving you the ability to pretend you're a military genius capable of clearing an entire room of enemies with a single bullet ricocheting off walls?Don't get this game, buggy, unresponsive and downright crap. The AI is barely functional and has the incredible ability to spot and kill you through walls. Constantly. Moving a single step even crouched can alert an entire map to your position. Endlessly trawling through dull, drab environments looking for the solitary last enemy alive only to be sniped with a pistol through several brick walls across the map IS NOT FUN. Dropping an Action Man in to a blender and recording it in Slow-Motion is definitely more fun than this. Save your £3.99 for anything else.**Not literally anything.			"

They did make small fixes after about a week of it being out, so we could ACTUALLY USE THE SERVER BROWSER, but by the time it was done, no one played. And for good reason.DO. NOT.

Posted: February 8, 2014
												So I got this game as a gift recently.  Even as a free gift from a friend, this game is not worth playing.Giving your friend a gift of this game is akin to giving him a boxed present that is filled to the brim with droppings from a variety of different animals combined.Where can one begin on a game of so many failed things?The controls are stiff and uncomfortable, to start off.  Think ""Rainbow Six"", except not good.  Movement is a chore and no matter how slow you move, the AI seems to detect you through eight layers of concrete and steel without problem, even though you are making no noise on your end - The disconnect between what you hear and what the enemies can hear is severely disruptive.  You can move faster, but it does not help, nor is it advised.  You will always run straight into one of the AI juggernauts I will cover shortly.  The gunplay is abhorrent; barely tolerable. Every weapon feels, handles, and operates the same way (no differentiation between firearms) and are thoroughly  unenjoyable to use or fire.  The sounds are bland, stock, generic. . . etc.  Any word you can imagine to describe forgettable sounds applies here.  I can't think of a single sound that made me feel immersed, excited, thrilled, or anything you would WANT to feel about sound.  The sound design in this game is on par with Rainbow Six.  That game came out in 1998.  And so we get to the most offensive part of this game: the AI.  The enemy AI, if you would even stoop so low to call it that, is beyond unbelievable.  Not in the positive way, either.  It's so bad it needs its own paragraph to discuss it.  My average experience in this game upon loading a match up is seeing the first enemy in the level, maybe 15 seconds in, go from looking away from me, to instantly rotating 90 degrees towards me in a single frame, and then proceeding to headshot me from 50 feet away, ending my game instantly.  They will either stand still and eat bullets for you, or annihilate you mercilessly and without a single modicum of realism in their actions.  There is no middle ground.  These are hellish terminators bent on the destruction of humankind, loaded up with aimbot and wallhack software, yet with nearly absent pathfinding and tactical skills.  They are idiot savants who are expert marksmen yet walk into walls and freeze up upon trying to navigate the infinitely difficult obstacles of a simple wooden doorway.This is not a fun game.  This is barely even a game.  I have difficulty in believing that people intentionally made something this horrid.  I went into this wanting to like it, I truly did.  It had the heritage of Rainbow Six and tactical squad gameplay behind it, devs who wanted to do the old series justice, and the potential that new technology and a fresh perspective could have brought to the genre.  Instead, I was assaulted by an unplayable monstrosity that should have been put down by the evil scientists who created it before it broke loose from their lab.After playing a while with my friend who gifted me the game, the only redeeming values I found about the entire game were these:""Well, the models look pretty good.""""Aw dude, I can see your flashlight when you shine it.  That's awesome.""When the only things I can commend about your work are the above, you know you have problems.I do not recommend purchasing this game.  Indeed, if you're reading this, go somewhere else for your tactical action needs.  They will not be satisfied here.			"

												It was a dark stormy night... I had nothing going on but Twitch Streamers and Snicker candy bars. It was a peaceful night until I see the message. ""You have 1 new item in your inventory"" it read. I scream with joy for this is the first gift anyone has ever sent me. I open it and see the game ""Takedown Red Sabre"" with the message saying ""Hey man, this is the greatest game ever on stream. Graphics are high quality, gameplay is realistic, and the AI is the best! Enjoy!"" - my ex-friend. I click install and the game only took 5 seconds to download because it was only 25mbs in size. I launch the game and this...is my story.The first thing I had done was click on the graphics options ( so I can disable certain settings because at the time, I had a DELL Inspirion, the greatest laptop NA ) and configure it to my liking until my friend messages me saying ""Just max out the settings, you can handle it"" I get a bit confused for my PC at the time wasn't the greatest but I just simply followed his orders and started the game. The first thing I had noticed was that the graphics were the worst thing I had ever seen in my life. Poor player models, lame effects, and dirty textures. I thought to myself ""Well maybe this game is in beta????"" ... I was wrong. I start to move around and I noticed that my AI teammates were braindead. They never followed me when ever I gave them the order to, they never shot until I was killed, and best of all they never even bothered giving me intel on where the enemy had been. So I simply walk by my self down the flight of stairs until I see an enemy. He startled me so I fired... I missed and at that moment, I knew I had ♥♥♥♥ed up. He slowly turns to look at me and then he fires once at my leg. My player stutters then collapses to a fatal position.... He was dead. I scratch my head and wonder exactly what in the actually ♥♥♥♥ just happened. The game is so♥♥♥♥♥♥ that every single weapon kills you in 1 BULLET. No matter where you are shot, the bullet will just kill you. I started to rage so I quit the game at 0.5 hrs completed.This will be a game, I will never play ever again. Please, I beg of you, do not buy this game under any circumstances.			"

												This game should not be classified as a game, as it is an unfinished product a later alpha at best, if you have the misfortune of owning it, look in the games main folder it says ""Early Access"" that should tell you the amount of effort alone. The AI can range from completely stupid, to unrealistically accurate, the game is riddled with various menu bugs, such as when you choose a level you don't always get the level you choose, and in addtion the inventory system rarely saves. I could never recomend this ""Game"" to anyone espically when the games it clams to be based off are vastly superior, even now Swat 4 is a better game, a 2004 game is better then this, even Swat 3 is better because it's AI was at least competent as far as team AI goes, IE: Checking corners by leaning.And the biggest culprit of all to this bad game is the devlopers who blame their community for ""Not being hardcore enough"" they don't even have the gumption to admit their game is severely underdevloped compaired to the games they ""Based"" their game off of. If your thinking of buying this, just don't there are at most 3 servers if you are lucky, mostly none though.			"

												WARNING!! ****  DO NOT BUY ****While this game is relatively inexpensive, it is priced far too high for its level of quality, and should be avoided.  The game was not finished prior to launch and it remains laden with bugs and missing/broken features.  Serellan (the developer) was never able to get dynamic shadows to function properly, even with the help of the game engine's developer, so the game's lighting is a bit off.  Physics are a joke, characters do some strange things when they're killed and ragdoll physics take over, and the resulting odd behavioir is probably the only positive thing about the game because it might give you a laugh.  Artificial intelligence of the enemy was ""better than Chuck Norris"" ridiculous when the game launched, and friendly AI is borked in the opposite direction, effectively eliminating any sort of ""tactical"" feel to the game.  It plays like a really bad knockoff of a really bad game.  Spend your money on something developed by someone that is capable and willing to produce a quality indie title.  Setting $15 on fire and watching it burn would be more entertaining and worthwhile.* NOTE: It appears the new Steam tagging system is subject to heavy censorship/moderation.  Every negative ""popular"" tag seems to have been scrubbed.  Do publishers & game developers have a say as to what tags are ok and what must be removed?  I sure hope not...			"

												Alright. Okay. Hear me out. This game's got some flaws. The movement is kinda clunky and the hit detection is a bit off. BUTWhat I'm trying to say here is that there's been a little bit of unfair criticism goin' on here. The brunt of it has been on this game's AI. People say it's ""bad."" But ask yourself this before you count yourself among them. What if this game just features the most advanced enemy morality system ever devised in a video game?      What if, that time an enemy shot your teammate then stared at you doing nothing, what if he was simply, at that moment, being overwhelmed with the crushing reality of the fact that he'd just killed a human being? And you shot him in the face, didn't you? You didn't even think about it. You chalked it up to ""bad AI.""      That terrorist got up this morning, just like you did, put on his beret, kissed his wife and kids, and left for work. His oldest daughter had just gotten into that college she loved. His little boy had show-and-tell that day at school. He was bringing his dad's fatigues in to show off to his friends. He drove to work, just like he had every other day. He said heartfelt ""good mornings"" to all his colleagues. Jim's wife had gone into labour the day earlier and given birth to a baby girl; Jim's shift ended in two hours. He was going to see her. Tom was the one who always took care of the plants around the office. He didn't mind; it brought a smile to his face. A typical Thursday.      They grabbed their bombs and headed out to their routine day of terrorism. Jim and Tom sat around playing cards. Tom couldn't ever seem to win; he just liked playing because he got to hang out with Jim. He couldn't know that this was the last time he would ever see him.      A frag grenade landed on Jim's lap. A flash of light and a deafening boom. Jim's body had been torn apart by shards of metal before he could react. Tom just sat there, eyes wide, cards still gripped in his hands, just trying to understand what had happened to his friend Jim. As he turned, he saw two more of his coworkers cut down by the SWAT team that was now entering the room. There had been no screams, no chance to cry out. Tom raised his weapon and fired, surprising himself. He hadn't even remembered picking it up. One of the SWAT officers crumpled to the floor, one last monosyllable escaping his lips. Tom stood there over the man, mouth slightly open. He'd done this. He'd killed this man. Why? For what? He hadn't meant to. He didn't even know the man's name. Tom turned toward the other officers, raising his hands. ""No, I didn't mean to, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, please.""      He would have said these things. He would have calmly knelt down and been handcuffed and gone quietly. He would have lived the rest of his life a shell of a man, haunted by the memories of his friends, gone in the blink of an eye one Thursday. He would have done a great many things. But he wasn't given the chance. Tom was shot thirteen times by the remaining SWAT officers. He was dead before he heard the shots.       10/10 best game 2014			"

												TakeDown:RedSabrethis game promised to bring back tactical shooters and re-invent a now dead genre. Needless to say that this is not the case. lets break down why the game is so bad.Gameplay:Terrible squad and enemy Artificial intelligence. they spend more time shooting at walls than each other.Meaningless customization: Three different armor types and multiple weapons that behaive exactly the same.The enemies can one shot kill you, no matter where they hit you regardless of armor.Interface:very difficult to traverse menus.Lack of visual settingsMisc:Good luck setting up multi-player for friends.Now lets look at some other points. The price is currently set at $5.49 CDN, this is still way to much to buy this game for, in fact this is a game that you should not even accept as a gift. I bought 4 copies of this game for $5.49 TOTAL, so that my friends could suffer along with me.and finally let me remind you of the awards section of the store page. (with my own commentary in brackets)AwardsFPS Guru - Pax Prime'13 Most InnovativeThe Most Innovative award is yet another indie title (Step your game up pax....). One of the great things about indie games is they always manage to be unique and bring something new to the table (Not always good). They're able to take the risks that triple A companies aren't. This is a company that has made the decision to skip following the generic shooter genre, let's get rid of levels(Maybe this is why there are only four maps...) , noob tubing, and throw in tactics (if by tactics they mean boredom) and strategy (and by strategy they mean endless buyers remorse) instead. Serellan LLC certainly deserves this award for (Ruining) their tactical shooter, Takedown: Red Sabre. (The name of the game also doubles as a request to valve)Takedown: Red Sabre encourages the player to communicate with their team mates (by yelling at the npcs for walking into walls)  and take on each mission differently (in exactly the same fashion) , in their hope to survive. don't expect to be running and gunning down the hallways, because (good luck finding anyone to shoot) there's no respawning(apart from the fact that you turn into team mates after death). It's a (Dis)pleasure to see a return to the tactical shooter and what appears to be a(n) (un)successful return. Once I got my hands on Takedown: Red Sabre it was difficult to stop. (Because the menus wouldent let you.)			"

												Fakedown: Red Gaybre is a game where:-You fall half a metre and die of ebola and coronary heart disease-The AI brings a sniper with a scope to a CQB scenario-The terrorists are actually super mutants with super hearing who are angry at their creators 'cause they can sure as hell hear you creeping 3 rooms away-You have 3 speeds of travel;walking,brisk-walking(wtf) and sprinting-They give you a butt-load of SMGs and ARs but only one sniper and shotgun. But who cares 'cause we can't tell the difference-Enemy bullets are like anti-goodguy bullets which will disintegrate your HEAVY armor and straight out kill you.-You have to use task manager to quit the game-You regret buying the game eventhough you got it for free-The pistols look like they have dwarfism+You get trading cards. Dats cool i guess+You have a great time laughing with friends in the training missions but lose them once you start playing the actual missions+You can put flags on your armor. Dats cool 2 i guess+You find the motivation to be successful in life just because you don't want to end up like this gameOverall, buy this game as a gift for your mortal enemy and pray they don't do the same to you.

												I might say that this game is mediocre.The concept is cool, I like the idea on bringing back the old school hardcore fps shooter style...but there are so many lacks on the system in its complexity.There were a lot of problems with the developing on this game...the publisher wanted to release the game as soon as possible..and the developers were at half of the project probably.As we can see the I.A. of this game is very poor...at it works as if you're behind the enemy, the enemy won't see you but if you're on the enemy's angle of view...you're screwed..BUT..you could fool the system by hiding with the Q and E keys behind a wall, and they will basically ignore you..The graphics is really horrible even if we consider that it has been developed with the UT graphics engine..and we fairly know that the lightining of that engine are extraordinary.Here on most levels the lightining is set on an horrible state...but it's good in HQ's environment...so we could understand that there has been completely a lack of time for the developers...they could have done a better work if they had more time.[Sorry for eventual mistakes, I'm 15 and english is not my native language.]			"

												""Takedown: Red Sabre is largely unfinished but may have potential if it was finished""As a fan of tactical FPS games such as Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and Arma I was excited to hear about Takedown: Red Sabre. Unfortunately, the game failed to live upto the hype, which was promised by the developers, as being a realistic tactical FPS. In almost every area of the game it's clear to see that the game was rushed with apparently no time spent whatsoever for polishing or improving the game before it's release.In terms of gameplay, majority of the game is actually there but it's poorly implemented. Enemies range from being completely unaware of you to being deadly accurate. The friendly AI is almost completely lacking, which makes singleplayer completely unenjoyable. However, the game's core mechanics are in fact there, which means that there is a small amount of fun to be had if you choose to play the game with friends. But be aware, there is no way to create private matches and there are no online games available at all at the time of writing this review. If you can live with some 'small' niggles such as the unbelievably slow walking speed, the fact that any height can kill you and the AI the game is playable but it just doesn't live up to what the developers promised.The level design is one of the few aspects of the game that appears to have been properly thought out with levels that feature tight hallways and open spaces which might create a tactical FPS if the game's mechanics were equally polished. The graphics aren't terrible (on low settings) and even lower end machines should be able to handle the game pretty easily.Overall, Takedown: Red Sabre is largely unfinished but might have some potential to live up to it's promises if someone took the time to finish it and give it the polish it desperately needs.

												Does man deserve perfection?     Such a question has been passed for centuries, reaching the farthest inquiries and the sharpest of minds. If man does not have perfection, it will strive to one day create it. Such is the pursuit of happiness. When pleasure takes presidence in the human mind and perfection has been sought for a millenia, what beautiful creation may be spawned? Man made a gem.      A ruby.      A radiant pearl in the depths of sorrow and distraught.     A gleaming beacon of hope in a dark sea of dissatisfaction.     A flawless painting that picques the picassos. Man made Takedown: Red Sabre.     An enigma wrapped in golden silk, Takedown draws you in with its deep character customization, and limitless combinations of weapons and attachments. At the main menu alone, I was at first overwhelmed with the flood of paths I could begin on. Luckily for us all, the God-crafted tutorial helps to soften the blow of the numerous gamemodes and maps. With a simple and stylish interface, Takedown takes you for a ride, yet holds your hand and still kisses you during it, whispering words of encouragement as it occassionally nibbles at your ear.      Once in-game, you'll find the stunning realism to it all. After my first kill, I balled up my fist and held it over my mouth, turning from the screen. Moisture tickled the corners of my eyes, and I found myself shaking without end. The sound of the bullet, the scream of pain, and the thud of a lifeless being left me sighing in distress. For a moment, I truly believed that I had taken the life of another human being.       As you slowly make your way from corridor to corridor, you can almost feel the weight of your armor bearing down on you. Your comrades are with you though, and the bonds you form with one another will follow you until you exhale your last breath. As time progresses, you feel much like a spider, spinning beautiful gossamer to create an oh-so fragile web of emotions with your squadmates.     Rick ""The Stick"" Flick is a wild card, but has a soft spot when it comes to those he cares about. With a family photo in his locker and his locket, he's commited to those he brought into the world, and gentle with the woman he loves more than himself.     Feanus is emotional, quick to anger, but a loyal man regardless. His friends come first and that's the bottom line. Bullets or bickering, nothing will ever tear apart a bond that Feanus has built up. Known to be a bit fiesty, he keeps his pipop up on the front lines, and never lets his anger interfere with whatever mission is at hand.     Laffy Taffy is a quiet man, tired of the war he's endlessly fought, both in himself, and on the battlefield. An honest soldier trying to get by, he always seems to have a mission to be done, and a task for his gun. Although he seems little more than a melancholy soldier, Laffy Taffy has an easily brought out smile, and a grin that can turn the world jovial again.     And then there's you. Will you make a name for yourself? Will you put your life on the line over and over again and see to it that your loved ones see tomorrow? Will you take arms and fight for your brothers, your family, and your home? Will you gun your way through countless murderers, terrorists, and thieves to rid the world of filth?To be honest, you probably shouldn't.			"

												This game had a lot of promise. The concept was solid. A tactical thinking-man's shooter. The dream come reality in 2014 fell short compared to a game made in 2005, SWAT 4.My biggest complaint is the AI is embarrassing. The enemy AI is oblivious. It never seems to respond to sound or much of the happenings in the environment. Only event that causes them to spring into action is if they catch the player visually in their line-of-sight. Additionally, the animations of enemies are robotic.As for the friendly AI, they are completely brain-dead. There are no real commands! You can tell them to stay and follow. Not look over there! Not stack up on this doorway! Not toss a flashbang in and clear! Nothing!I really wish this game lived up to my expectations, but it didn't. I cannot recommend it. Your time and money would be better spent on its inspirations, SWAT 4 and Rainbow Six.			"

												This game is terrible. Mechanics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ visuals are♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and nobody even plays at all ever. So good luck trying to even find a game online. Save your money. At $15 this is highway robbery. At $1.50 this is a waste of $1.50. If this was free to play, it would be a waste of your time to bother with it.1/10 -- would not ever recommend. Unless you paid me, in which case for a few hundred dollars I *might* give it a 3.P.S. If you are wondering about my play time: Yes I played it for 15 minutes on this account -- that was enought itme for me to get through the tutorial and play two rounds on an official server.  It really doesn't take long to see how terrible it is, and I'm sure you can tell by my review: it really wasnt worth any more time.It should tell you something that the videos for this in the store page show mediocre review snippets, and doctored images that aren't from the game itself.

Posted: October 11, 2014
												I purchased Takedown: Red Sabre back when it was around a dollar, guessing it be a capable, perhaps minimalistic first-person, tactical shooter, qualities I tend to occasionally enjoy and recommend, but in place of an entertaining romp through room clearing and CQC, I instead received an underwelming mix-match of unfinished ideas and interesting concepts.	Using Takedown's 'spiritual predecessors,' the Rainbow Six series and SWAT 4 -whose demos are still available online, as the standards for tactical shooters, Red Sabre falls a little short.	Starting with the mission select screen, the lack of a planning stage means the player is left to begin the mission blind as to the mission objective, general routes, and overall level design. Yes, several vague objectives are posted in the form of a style-over-substance video overlay, but their possible locations, numbers, and significance are all still left unknown or murky. A realistic estimation of the cloud of combat and the limitations of simple surveillance? Not really, seeing as all three of these aspects are sensible targets of approximation during the inevitable observations that occur prior to sending in tactical teams...Right? A simple, pre-mission map with rough outlines and selectable routes would be wonderful, as would some form of dialogue between squad and commander to answer any lingering mission details.	On the topic of missions, the actual mission objectives, considering Red Sabre's apparent tactical roots, are surprizingly bland and simplistic in nature, echoing the desires of a standardized checklist, rather than the actual SWAT operations they wish to emulate. Missing are the dynamic hostage rescues with captive/captor dialogue and potential loss of life due to the explosive nature of such echanges. Even compared to the earlier SWAT series, Takedown's missions are devoid of the atmospheric tension maintained through periodic use of covnversation and ambient comments.	    Then, when actually playing a mission, several basic capabilities are absent, namely squad manipulation and regular status updates. In place of a context menu or other useful method of commanding your team, a simple hold toggle and ROE wheel are offered, both of which obfuscate the all-essential room clearing, as your team is always behind you, in turn rendering useless the more elaborate levels with their multitude of cover and choke points, as your teammates will never actually take strategic positions or utilize flanks, and complicating simple matters of spacial awareness as our mates tend to vanish when not verbally announcing enemies, their virtual minds dead set on maintaining unnecessary radio silence. The ability to investigate, both physically and visually through your squadmates: rooms, towers, corners, windows, doors, would be a monumental improvement, as would simple formation and movement commands.	This brings into light, your squad's strange lack of communication. Yes, the AI announces spotted enemies, but that's seemingly the extent of their communicative ability. Positions, actions, general side-chatter, are all absent, replaced instead with a wall of silence and death. While the latter is more a subset of mood setting and tone, the former two topics of conveyance are important aspects of movement and firing maneuvers, as proper placement of suppression and flanking teams must be confirmed before performance. That, and the awkwardness of having to spin your character around to check their periodic status, when enemies are everpresent, is painful. The movie, Way of the Gun, provides a fun example of firefight communication, as do several article by dslyecxi, a founding member of ARMA's ShacTac.	    Lastly is a breakdown of the player's ironically standard moveset, given the advances in recent game design and Takedown's desire to be both modern and tactical. The player is limited to a digital lean, without a stepout or means of truly examining corners and bends, two digital stances, without any real cover system, nonexistent damage modeling -foot shots are instakills, and strangely simplified gun mechanics. As stated by its own developer, Red Sabre's crippled lean was intentional, but as demonstrated in RavenShield, fully analog leaning and stance change are possible, and with a reticule present -reticules being a sensible representation of the mental focal point one references when looking around and not the fabricated, game-world only gimmick some make it out to be btw, returning fire is possible so long as the weapon is locked to the view, an equally sensible representation, given SWAT behavior. The application of such a system would allow for full realization of the environment, window avoidance, and improved surveillance, aspects only improved upon by a fluid cover system, one that allows, at least in its most basic form, temporarily full coverage from fire, as shown in Red Orchestra and even Killzone or Perfect Dark, but in a more advanced form, with some manner of controlled cover migration. Exemplified in games like Receiver and the aforementioned Orchestra, gun mechanics can be rather complex without seeming overwhelming, so long as they're presented intuitively. Ammo checking, magazine management, individual component manipulation, bracing have therefore all been implemented in the past and have helped in pulling player skill and concentration away from reflexes and placing them on planning and execution.	    Along with several prevalent, submitted glitches, involving firing, aiming, and stance freezes, I hope the above mentioned points help illuminate the fact that, while not the horrid abomination some have made it out to be, Takedown: Red Sabre is at its best underdeveloped and at its worst, unfinished, statuses that could effectively be remedied via patches and/or modding. 	Looking into the history of Red Sabre, it would seem Takedown's developer, Serellan, started a KickStarter to create a certain type of product of a certain calibre, and after raising a fair amount of money -over $220,000, released a product of subpar qualities, even after praising their own past experience and ability. That's just frustrating and unprofessional.			"

												AwardsFPS Guru - Pax Prime'13 Most InnovativeThe Most Innovative award is yet another indie title. One of the great things about indie games is they always manage to be unique and bring something new to the table. They're able to take the risks that triple A companies aren't. This is a company that has made the decision to skip following the generic shooter genre, let's get rid of levels, noob tubing, and throw in tactics and strategy instead. Serellan LLC certainly deserves this award for their tactical shooter, Takedown: Red Sabre. Takedown: Red Sabre encourages the player to communicate with their team mates and take on each mission differently, in their hope to survive. Don't expect to be running and gunning down the hallways, because there's no respawning. It's a pleasure to see a return to the tactical shooter and what appears to be a successful return. Once I got my hands on Takedown: Red Sabre it was difficult to stop.so, how much did you pay FPSGuru to say that?			"

												I was really looking forward to this title. Personally, Rainbow Six Rogue Spear was among the first games i ever played.The game was funded on kickstarter with a goal of $200,000. Alas, it didn't live up to its expectations. Takedown Red Sabre vs Rainbow Six and SWAT First of all, it's not really that tactical. In Rainbow Six and SWAT you could review the layout of the level before starting, listen to the briefing, take advice from specialists etc. You would get a roaster of units to choose from - all having their portraits and biographies. Not only were those games tactical, they were very atmospheric.In this game you are just walking around as a nameless 3D model. You cannot command your teammates (other than basic follow or stop), you cannot switch to them, you cannot even choose their loadout.Honestly, the only bond between these games is the fact that everybody dies easily. Content It only offers 6 levels, one of which is a tutorial level.

As for weapons - 7 primary weapons and 3 pistols.http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Takedown:_Red_Sabre I simplified to account for all the clones. Issues Loadout customization is kind of bugged as well. Also, they have this thing - every scope except for holographic has a disturbing zoom in effect. Whatever effect they wanted to mimic, they shouldn't have. It's completely unnecessary and frustrating.The AI isn't that great either - neither your teammates' or enemies'. In fact, making allies follow you is not advisable, you are much better using them as extra lives. As for the enemy, these guys, while deadly, can still miss at point black range.Multiplayer and coop weren't working for some time, and when they did, they game died out. Conclusion I really think that $200,000 is just not enough to fund something worthy of being called a spiritual successor to Rainbow Six and SWAT. The game was made on Unreal engine, which requires quite a lot to license. Additionally, they probably spent quite a lot of their budget on weapon licensing.On top of that, the pricing of the game was only 15$. In the end, the game has too many problems that need to be fixed. It's not really superior to the rainbow six or swat in any way, even graphical, so you are better off playing the old games. They really nailed that ""everybody dies easily"" part, but the rest - enemy AI, game's depth, content, some game design choices, not so much. It's very shallow and just not worth your time.			"

												Note: To see  this review in it's true form go to: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2014/03/game-takedown-red-sabre.htmlI hate to have to give this game a bad review because a friend gave me this game for free, but the game is just not good. Where to start? First Single player is a no-go because your team ""AI"" is 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. they react in slow-mo and always end up dead in seconds. to make matters worse the enemy AI all have aim-bot, as soon as they see you, they hit you and mainly in the head or other critical areas.This alone makes single player impossible and boring as heck. The next thing you will notice is the sub par visuals and animations. you walk as slow as a turtle and even when sprinting you don't go that fast. once while leaning out of cover the game starting auto-leaning my player left and right, left and right. i had to shut it down and restart for it to stop. other times my screen would go red and blurry for no reason at all, once again only going away when i shut the game down. the weapons sound like crap, and even the animation for the guns is horrible. you'll feel like you are shooting a paintball gun not a colt M4 Carbine that the US Marines use.To make matters worse the game seems to have been set up to be released in Early access version, but then later for some reason the Devs decided to call it a day. what prove do i have of this? well other than the obviously un-finished gameplay, there is a folder in your steamapps called ""Takedown Red Sabre Early access"" . what more prove that the devs are desperate to sell this game? well, with each purchase you get TWO copies of the game that's right two for one! except the game still sucks, the only way i could see this ever being a reasonable purchase is if you get it for a Dollar or lower.Do yourself a favor and don't waste $15.99. if you need even more prove of how bad the game is just check out the reviews on steam. they ain't pretty,""Red Sabre was the single biggest disappointment of the past 2 years for me""  ""They sold an unfinished game, but advertised it as finished"" and most of them start along the lines of ""STOP, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!""  and it has a 2.6 Metascore based on 126 reviews.  seriously, spare yourself the horrors of this game.

												This has got to be the worst FPS I have ever played, made by one of the most childish developers imaginable. They froze threads on thier forums containing any opinions differing from their own, and on the steam forums they did much of the same thing. The game was released as an unplayable mess and to this day continues to be a nail in the Realistic-FPS genre's coffin. I grew up loving rainbow six and SWAT and prefer realistic shooters to generic fps games however I cannot reccommend this to anyone. It handles like a broken tricycle and has the most rediculous AI I have ever seen, some moments they cannot hear your bullets whiz by them point blank and others they can pick you off with 360 no scopes. STAY AWAY from this garbage, the rating is there for a reason.			"

												I see people hating on this game, but lets give actual reasons for why this game is bad okay?I'll start off with the pros, then move to the cons.The overall design direction is something that I honestly really liked.You get one life, a multitude of weapons to choose from, and you can experience this with your friends through different missions that will test your skill, ability to communicate as a team, and planning. The maps feel rather well laid out, and don't really detract from what this game is.\The difficulty that is presented with the AI also feels good, the enemies have very realistic bullet damage, so when going up against them, its quite based on if you can outsmart the AI.There is also a map editor that got placed into the game, haven't used it myself, but thats pretty cool!What does detract from it?Number one thing for me, is how clunky the controls feel, I can work around everything else, but controls feeling weird are honestly just a no go from me.The way everything handles just doesn't feel smooth in the slightest, so honestly most of the times I died honestly felt like they could be chocked up to how poorly it felt like it controlled. If you want to make a game difficult and challenging, go for it, but combine difficulty with poor handling and all you manage to create frustration. If difficulty is done right it can make players strive to beat the challenge.The game also makes a few missteps in how enemies and objectives are spawned. The objective and replayability of the game comes into play with how the arena should change, because the missions you're engaging in are as quick reaction to situations, so you wouldn't be going in knowing anything besides Maaaybe the floor plan of the buildings.But this gets negated when objectives spawn in the same places no matter what.Here's a place where a system like what Payday 2 has, where buildings have certain features that get randomized every time you load up a new match, would be amazingly beneficial and would go miles for replayability.I also praised the enemies a little earlier, however I should mention they're honestly very stupid, the designers managed to get around this slightly by placing all the enemies facing towards where the player would most likely appear in front of them, but still, there were situations where I managed to go behind an enemy and just follow them for a little while, so yeah, enemies are very unintelligent from my experience.Finally, the UI is fairly clunky and not very easy to manage, choosing a loadout honestly feels very weird, its been a long time since I played it, but it feels very unwieldy and hard to work with.I think the core idea of this game is definitely saveable, can this game be patched and fixed? If the controls could be made to be tighter, I would invest more time in this game, since I would honestly be able to enjoy the game. If there was more replayability through map randomization, then I think this could be a very competitive game instead of what it is in its current state.But as I was saying, the core idea is good, but the overall package doesn't really deliver since its not really a polished package. Stay away unless some of these things get fixed.			"

												I am a extremely big fan of the older tactical games. Especially Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield. I loved that game. And still do. So when I found out that one of the creators was working on a new game I went nuts. I told all my friends to buy it, and most actually did because we had such fond memories of the older tactical shooter games that aren't really being made anymore. Needless to say, my friends now hate me. This game lacks in every front. Graphically, map-wise (everything is very empty), the gameplay itself isn't good at all. Technically it's a mess. The AI is atrocious. Please do not purchase this game.			"

												Takedown: Red Sabre does not feel like a finished product. The performance is horrendous yet calling the visuals ""basic"" would be putting it nicely. No settings can be changed in-game and all adjustments must be done at the main menu. There are only three levels of visual detail to select from and changing this requires a full exit and restart of the game. Beyond the rudimentary presentation there is a shortage of content and what's there barely feels like a game. There is a training mission that feels half-finished, and the rest of the missions make little effort to give any sort of context into the situation. You are simply thrown into arbitrary settings to kill unidentified enemies with perfect aim suffering from braindead AI to complete objectives that are never really justified beyond a simple briefing. Movement is stiff to a fault, weapons lack panache, and performing any action just feels awkward. The online multiplayer is unsurprisingly a ghost town and the handful of missions are no fun to play in single-player anyway. Even if you're still longing for a return to tactical shooters the likes of SWAT 3/4 or Rainbow Six, Takedown isn't what you're looking for and as much as you may want to like it the game is sure to disappoint.

												A gritty zombie survival set in a near distant future. In the early game you must raise your zerglings while last hitting minions to ensure you get maximum exp. The story has branching dialogue trees with strong moral choices, do you want to let Aiden go mental, or bide your time and unleash the power of your thu'um.Can you stop Hugo from destroying Arkham city?Will you let Benny get away with shooting you?Can you defeat the elite four?All these question can be answered by solving the games many puzzles, and rising up against the looming threat of the tyranids.On the specs side of the game, it made me purchase a fourth GTX titan to achieve the ultra quality. It burnt out my 64gbs of RAM. Before buying this game, remember to watercool your entire house, it heats up your GPU about ten times more than Far cry 3 on Ultra. "

												Give it a shot if you are really bored... Put prepare to be utterly disapointed as this game might make you wish you spent the few dollars on a cheeseburger or something... The developer is probably drowning his sorrow in alchohol because of how many negative reviews this thing got. Speaking of that where the hell did the good reviews for this game come from in the trailer? I mainly purchased it because it was sale for a buck which I kinda wish I spent on a few gumballs... The characters can go from being kickass to rookie which I hopefully assume is a way to make it look like their is somekind of skill system if any. Poor developer who made this game... I bet he knows how much it actually sucks. I tried likeing this game, and I kinda do... At least when the AI is not being complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ But overal... If you want a game that you sink atleast 4 or 6 hours into, I would rather get something else. Sorry but its pretty bad game.			"

												To keep this review simple I will sum it up thusly.Takedown: Red Sabre was released in 2014 to revive the tactical shooter genere AND YET it plays like the alpha version of Rainbow 6: Raven Shield which was released in 2003.What R6:RS did for tactical shooters, setting the bar for mission planning and execution, Takedown fails miserably at. There is no mission map, no planning method, no meaningful squad control (only to shoot, or not, or hold posistion), the enemy AI always sees you while your squad MAY see them, all glass (from my experience) seems to be bullet proof, and suppressed weapons will still draw a lot of attention. i could go on but this game is pretty awful and there seems no inclination to fix it.Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery but I am pretty sure that UbiSoft and Red Storm would have rather not had this title try to emulate their well crafted game.

												［ＥＮ/ＦＲ］　That game is nothing more thanA SCAMWhy? First, the game is empty, nothing to do, the game-play is like a 1995's game, 2 monkeys lock in a room can do better in only 10 minutes....  Why i have really angry again the devs ? Because he told ''That will like be SWAT4'', He take the name of a awesome game to make people believe in his game, so he get money from a crowdfunding, and stop after....For now, he clearly say the game is canceled, but still in sale in Steam, still people can mistake and bought the game, If its wasen't a scam, the game would be already removed....For me, that one of the worst game i played in my life, even Delta Force 2 (1999) is better !If you are looking for a great SWAT game, play SWAT 4, that game is awesome, even the server are down and still no steam edition....Ce jeu, c'est pas difficile, C'est une arnaque pur et simple, pourquoi ?Déja parce que le jeu n'a rien, tout simplement, quelques map, quelques armes, bref 2 singes enfermer dans un bureau ferrait mieux en selement 10 minutes....Pourquoi je suis énervé contre les devs ? Pour avoir dit ''Le jeu sera comme SWAT4'', Prendre un nom de jeu comme ça, attirer des gens, pour ensuite faire un crowdfunding, ramasser de l'argent, et annuler le jeu derrière....Et maintenant, le jeu est clairement annuler, mais toujours en vente, encore une preuve d'arnaque, le jeu aurait déjà été retirer si ce n'etait pas une arnaque...C'est l'un des plus mauvais jeu auquel j'ai jouer, Delta force 2 est largement mieux (1999)Si vous cherchez un très bon jeu de SWAT, je recommende sérieusement SWAT 4, Ce jeu la, au moins, vaut vraiment le coup !

												Travel around the world to exotic locales with team Red Sabre, a team of operatives from various nations who seem to walk around at a pace no greater than your average, garden variety snail as you fight terrorists with some of the smallest handguns to have ever seen production. And employ real world tactics used by S.O.F. units, such as 'hacking' servers with your mind, and running in blind due to lack of any pre-mission planning.Non-existant squad A.I. which will call out targets and not engage, despite have a clear shot from a good firing position, despite having loosened the R.O.E. As well as blocking doorways and narrow corridors. They can't be issued any orders either.Terribad enemy A.I. which will pick off your A.I. squad members rather methodically from awkward positions as your squad never returns fire. They are also know to aimbot the crap out of anyone, anywhere, anytime.This game is wasted potential, and could have been so much better. Terrible singleplayer, but a decent co-op experience, if you can get passed all the shortcomings.			"

												I do like this game. It does have a long list of problems. Like, surprisingly bad for a game based on Unreal 3 Engine. The controls are clunky. The AI is clumsy on pathing, but very good on reacting to your sound (light armor and light gun make all the difference in CQB maps because of noise more than mobility/muzzle length. The AI of your teammates is almost non-existent, and incredibly disappointing, considering Christian Allen's pedigree.The interface is god-awful and forgets maps your selections every time you finish a round. It appears to forget your loadout selections too, but it doesn't (though sometimes I select a loadout and it doesn't work)And multiplayer? Well, no one plays this game. And if you try to make co-op multiplayer work, you'll find it won't connect without a whole lot of troubleshooting (use Tunngle.)All that being said, it is challenging. The bots don't mess around with their aim, and react very well to any noise you make (if they don't fail at pathing) When I first started playing, I felt proud if I could kill 20 people before I died. And without unlocks in the game, it lends itself well to having this kind of challenge and not being frustrating. I've had some really classic moments playing this game, and it can get REALLY intense at times.I have logged 29 hours in this game, and I still haven't beaten Cargo Ship or Facility. I still really like playing it!But... it's currently at a low price and it's a great deal if you want a challenging Tactical FPS. The bugs don't *break* the experience, but it helps to go into the purchase expecting to get a game that feels like it's still in Beta.			"

												I've gotten this game for about $1.50 and to me, it's still not worth it.  I see some people defending this game and it always confuses me.  I'm all up for reviving the slow pace tactical game play but this game doesn't really offer anything good at all.  The squad function is minimal, only having two options for your squad.  There's squad movement and squad rule of engagement with only two options for each.  There's hold and follow then aggressive and defensive.  Just the barebones for controlling your squad.  You can't tell them to throw any grenades, clear rooms, breach doors, just barebones.  Also, only 6 maps.  It isn't much at all but at least the maps look somewhat nice.  Let's talk about the AI.  I know that this game is suppose to be played with 3 other people but this game is absolutely dead and no one wants to play it.  Your teammates just stand there and get shot at.  They're absolutely useless when it counts.  Also, all I can say about the graphics is that they're horrible and they look like they're from the PS2 era.From what I can say, do yourself a favor and buy Rainbow Six 3 and you know what's sad?  A game from 2003 still surpasses a game from 2013 and that's completely unacceptable.			"

												Design wise, not a bad attempt at a basic little tactical shooter. At £3.99 I wasn't expecting a masterpiece of game design, and I was fairly happy with the mechanics etc. It's a small scale game which doesn't require any real time commitment and you can pick it up and put it down as you please without losing any of the experience.However, there are game-breaking bugs such as crashes on loading screens. I've yet to come across anything that restarting the game won't fix, but if you aren't prepared to deal with this kind of thing (which is of course perfectly reasonable) don't buy this game. Personally, I don't really mind. Although like I say, people have every right to complain about it, as you're paying for a working product and getting something which doesn't work as it should.So, in summary, I quite like this game as an idea. HOWEVER, bearing in mind that really this is an unfinished product being sold as a finished one, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.			"

												This game COULD HAVE BEEN a great classic shooter from the old days of Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon. However from day one this game is simply a laugh. Too many bugs and the worst AI make this just a complete failure. A shame really, cause if they would have released it as an Early Access the community would have still supported it. Don't buy this game and just go for Rainbow Six Siege, Ravenshield or the complete Ghost Recon collection instead.			"

												Well, if you're expecting Rainbow Six or SWAT-like gameplay, run away.I really wanted to see this game succeed a few years back before it got released, but it never has, and probably never will. I remember back during initial launch it was almost impossible to join friends. It was plagued by awful AI and many problems. I relaunched it recently to see if anything has changed, and if it was playable. Well, it's playable, but the AI is still the absolute worst. I almost want to call VAC bans on the AI, due to their aimbot nature. And your team AI is absolutely laughable. When they aren't doing crouches because they missed leg day, they're mindlessly standing behind you staring at your back instead of actually functioning like a team. Given that you respawn as the next member of your squad if you happen to die, if that member happens to be standing right in the way of enemy fire you're going to die in 1 ms. Now repeat that two more times until game over.The presentation of the game initially seems nice. The voice acting is alright and the UI in the lobby is decent. Once you load into the map though, everything becomes lifeless and silent. It doesn't feel like anything more than assets pieced together with poor AI.It had a vision and initial promise, but the game failed to achieve it, and now we wonder what it could have been.(Oh, and it used to be sold for $15. Now it's $5, and I still think that's too much to pay. Get it at less than $1 or avoid it completely.)			"

												I (not) proudly present you this review of a game I can't exactly tell whether or not I should recommend it...Takedown was a succefully kickstartered game that made it's way onto steam only to receive negative aclaim from every possible reviewer. The AI was broken in never before seen proportions (I remember a video I saw once upon it's release last year where the player shot at the side of an enemy an unsilenced rifle, only to receive as an AI reaction: nothing... after that, he shot in the same place his SILENCED pistol, only to receive as a reaction: the AI turns around and clunkily shoots the player, killing him.) Thankfully it has been heavily patched, but the AI is still painfully broken. An issues is that once you spawn on the map the AI know your exact position and some (not all, of course) enemies will rush your spawn point. For tactical FPS stealth fans like me, the classic Rainbow Six fanboy, this is a dealbreaker for the game, immediately removing your will to complete it's 6 maps.yes, it has *only* 6 missions. Half of them are boring (the ship at night is an outright copy of the 2nd mission of Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear from 1999! and it's done REALLY poorly!)The prize you get for completing the mission is: nothing! Sense of completion is next to nil thanks to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI that wins is numbers, not in smarts, the clear aimbot they have also make the game unbelievably easy sometimes and other times a boring chore of unfair difficulty ON THE SAME MAP! It's not balanced properly and it feels like you are playing according to the game/AI's mood rather than testing your skills in a tough but fair game like Rainbow Six! The devs seemed to have dropped out of high-school because they don't have a ♥♥♥♥ing clue on how light reflection and refraction through a basic glass window/door works in real life and thus, in a video game!The textures are muddy and bland. The game looks from 2007 (and even then, PS2 titles from 2007 like Black (absolute masterpiece, go play it whenever you can!) look BETTER! A PS2 GAME!).The story is literally non-existant, even other tactical shooters like Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear (again I'll mention the date of Rogue Spear's release to embarass this game: 1999!) had a coherent (though, basic) and good enough storyline!The gunplay is ok, I suppose, guns have nice recoil, though the handling is clunky at best: Even with a full magazine you can reload your gun, which is weird and pointless. The reload animations are outright terrible, just watch somewhere the M4 and it's variant's reload animation (which is the same) and then have a few laughs and publish that on Facebook or something, that will make someone's day, escpecially if that someone is an avid gun-nut.Sound design is bad as well, lighting effects are abysmal (your flashlight only lights up a circle in front of you, light doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing suffer dispersion through the air or refract through glass, again! The devs got their degree at a Starbucks warehouse...), everyone know air is made of particles and gases that disperse the light into an omnidirectional radius (the flashlight should illuminate in front of you, but also stuff near and at your sides, because that's how dispersion and basic reflection physics work!), right? I'm looking a bit pretensious here, but it's basic physics, everyone should know that!Almost forgot about the music! It doesn't exist! Only 1 action-movie-generic song nº1003530 at the menu and that's it.Finally: The loadout system, it's broken! It doesn't save ocasionally, and it doesn't tell which button saves, because there isn't a ""pick loadout"" option, only the ""change loadout"" option and you have like 5 loadouts, so when you start your mission, pray you get the one you want! It's incredibly random and After 4 hours, I still have no clue on how to change it, whenever I want to change, I press everything, every combination possible and it outright does not work! (If anyone know, plz tell me, thanks in advance!) The game lacks, giving the player basic guides or ideas, the grenade throw is clunky at best as well, with an abstract bar telling the force of the throw. The grenade doesn't respect basic physics' laws at all either!I was STILL going to recommend it (it dropped from 13,99€ to 4,99€ a while ago, with a 4-pack costing now 14,99€), but I just saw E3 and its recently announced title ""Rainbow Six: Siege"", which looks MILES away better than this! So much that I am now telling you to not buy this unless under 1€ and/or wait for R6:Siege to bring back old-school great tactical FPS goodness back to gaming, such tactical greatness that gamers haven't witnessed being well done since Rainbow Six: Raven Shield from 2003!4/10, it's fun for a while only... ultimately comes down to you!SMALL EDIT: R6:Siege is looking so ♥♥♥♥ing terrible lol. I advise you to get Insurgency or Rainbow Six 3: Gold Edition on steam. You can pick both up for 20€ or on a sale for a combined total of about 5€.I am so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disappointed O_o Siege looks so bad! Looks like the Tactical FPS genre isn't coming back any time soon...  "

												This game ist not good. At all. The AI doesn't work - and is inconsistant at that: Occasionally, your enemies dont even see you when you're in front of them, sometimes they kill you when you walk through a door. Your teammates dont help either (at least they didn't last time I played): Mostly, they track the enemies through the wall and then just stand where they were, trying to see them - through a solid wall. The game does not at all meet any expectations created by the advertising and the trailers.You should not buy this game if you want a fun game to play, but should it be on sale for less then 1€ and you can live with paying developers who are basically scamming, the game is good for a quick laugh.Wait for CSGO to be on sale and get that instead, maybe even for less than this bad game is now (5€) - and if you want something to do in the meantime, you can still make fun of me for having payed 13€ for this bad game at its release.

												This is an Unreal based co-op FPS based around realism and tactical gameplay.  This is a very hard, unforgiving game that often sees you killed in 1 shot.  You do have no HUD identifier for friendlies, so a lot of friendIy fire is expected.  It is such a shame people 'reviewed' this on meta critic to be a ~30%. Though it is not made clear on the store page, this was, and still is, in ALPHA.  This ruined the indie developers chance to make a fun, small co-op Counter-Srike/PayDay2 like game. All the problems complained about at meta critic have been fixed already!  The AI is repsonsive, the AI does not 'cheat', and the menus work.  There are still things that need to be added, like an option for Push-to-Talk VOIP in game, but it is well worth a $5 buy as it is now.			"

It has a level editor which is really nice, I'll at least give the devs points for that. Too bad the game is garbage. The game is playable but barely. 3/10			"

												""TAKEDOWN is a thinking-person’s shooter""If you are a thinking person, avoid this game at all costs.This is one of the negative examples of Kickstarter. A broken, unfinished game, that isn't getting any support anymore.The singleplayer is atrocious, thanks to the terrible AI and the multiplayer seems to be completely dead.I'm glad I did not spend a single dime on this mess of a game and neither should you, unless you really want to experience how bad this game is personally.

												Avoid it like the plague.This game is awkward. It's full of bugs and enemy's AI is horrendous. Sometimes enemies kill you instantly from nowhere, sometimes they can't shoot you even if you're standing right in front of them. BUT - if you can play it together with a bunch of friends you can give it a try. Or you can save up the money and buy yourself a good beer.			"

												Oh boy, Takedown: Red Sabre, this game is probaly the worst FPS Shooter since the Modern Warfare Franchise. Alright, I'm gonna just go jump in right away to the movement, now you might be asking,""What? The movement? Why is that?"" Well, the reason for it is because there is 3 MODES of running, 3 MODES! Now you might be saying,""3 Modes of running? I thought this was a FPS Shooter not a Racing game!"" I thought the exact same thing. You have walking mode, which is slow as hell, then you got running mode which only increases the walking by the smallest bit, and to do so you hold SHIFT, and lastly, sprinting, which increases your running by a lot, now the funny thing is the way you sprint is that you have to hold CTRL, yes, CTRL. Why would they even have running if you can just sprint?Anyway, the next thing I want to talk about is the recoil, the recoil on every gun on this game is terrible, and I am not just saying that, the bad recoil and plus the bad movement combined are making the gameplay for this game terrible. Next is the servers, alright, so after doing the terrible tutorial, I went to have a look on some Multiplayer servers, I only found around about 4 servers that were up, 2 had hardly anybody on the server, and the other 2 servers could only manage a player limit of 14 players. I joined the server, to my surprise having no music. I also had a objective to do, which was to defend something, while also trying to plant a bomb (Gee, doesn't that remind you of a game?). The game acts like Arena Mode in Team Fortress 2, where if everyone on one team dies, they loose, no respawn. I found the maps to be the exact same just with different textures, and each map was as confusing as the other. It took me 4 minutes to actually find a enemy, and when I finally did, the player would kill me in a near instant, not giving me a chance to do... really anything. And with the the small amount of players on the server, the rounds went quick. After Multiplayer, I gave a go at Singleplayer, hoping that I could get trained, because at the time, I thought it was me that was bad. The AI on Singleplayer was horrendous. Your teammates would basically follow you and shoot any enemy in their sight. Another thing was that when you died you turned into one of your teammates. Now, the enemy AI are scattered around the map, and If you try to open a door and a enemy is on the other side you have no chance of survival, since bullets basically instakill you in this game. Takedown: Red Sabre! Around 5$ just to get this game is not worth it. I would rather recommend Black Ops 2 than this terribly programmed game.			"

												Is this game fun? Yes i enjoy it quite a bit, but not for the right reasons. This game should never have been released in its current state it is a garbage excuse for a full game and should be labled early access. AI is awful the worst i have seen, Gunplay is questionable, and  controls are buggy to say the least every gun model is virtually the same. There are 5 awful excuses for missions. I would take back the money spent on this game in a heartbeat. I must admit though this game is one of my favorites for laughs but DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY this game if you are looking for a good tactical shooter i would not recommend to someone i dont know but i would say you need AT LEAST 1 other person. This game is garbage to the point of almost unbeatability but i do have my fair share of laughs and its pretty much the only reason i havent uninstalled this game			"

Posted: May 2, 2014
												Let me just preface this review by saying I wanted to enjoy this game. I really did. A hard, realistic fps was something I enjoy, and have been looking for different simulation fpses since I picked up a copy of Arma: Cold War Assault. So I was pretty excited to try this out, especially since I got it so cheap. What I got, however, was so subpar, I had a hard time making it to an hour played before turning it off and telling myself I was simply done. While I do not enjoy speaking so poorly about games, especially one that I spend such little time on, I have more than seen enough to warn against buying this game.The Good: Plenty replay valueThe Bad: Clunky controls, barely-functional AI, sub-par graphicsPremise: To put it simply, Takedown: Red Sabre is as unfinished as an Alpha test. The entire game falls short in almost every aspect of play. Story: N/AMechanics: The controls feel slow, sometimes unresponsive. A few times during play, I would swap weapons and it still have my primary out until I clicked to aim down sight or shoot or I would lean and then move, only to be stuck leaning until I leaned the other way and be trapped in some wierd continuum. As a testement to how unpolished this game is, the sprint has no animation, at all. Gunplay felt off, as well. Handguns feel like extremely weak airsoft weaponry. While every other weapon in the game usually felt normal, I couldn't help but feel that there was too small a selection. And the class-like system? Kinda a joke, considering weapons aren't restricted to a certain class.Single-player: Being a tactical fps, you're given four squadmates (or less depending on the mode), which are all of equal use: none. You cannot give them orders, and they're literally so stupid, they cannot function on their own. The squadmates tend to alert the enemies by standing in the open, even if you're behind a crate or a wall. Aside from this, their aim is usually slow, which ends up in them being killed off. This becomes a problem when its so easy to die, and while you take control of an AI after death, there's usually no use trying. Often, I took over just to be gunned down by the exact same enemy because the AI positioned themselves directly behind me. More often than that, the AI would have hp in the red, meaning there would be no surviving another shot. Its also no help that the enemy AI is incredibly unbalanced and incoherent on difficulty. Some AI are stupid while others will try to flank. Often, however, you will crawl around a corner or up some stairs to be gunned down instantly as if the enemy had an aimbot. This can cause some extremely frustrating gameplay. Multi-player: From the singular game my client could find (even after checking the server list), the game played quite the same. However, the unintelligent squadmates were replaced by players. Though they used voice chat, the lag was so terrible that every word came out choppy. As far as I could find, there was no scoreboard, so it was impossible to tell who was dead and what everyone's pings were. After dealing with the choppy-voiced insults for a couple rounds, I decided that I would much rather stick to the equally frustrating single-player portion for abit. When I tried to play multi-player again, no servers could be found and I gave up on that portion of the game.Graphics: The graphics were far from on-par with latest games in the genre, which is understandable as the studio was relatively unheard of. My PC may not be the best by far, but CSS looked better than this game, and still ran twice as well. However, they were not terrible to look at, except on the lowest setting.Final Verdict: The game is good for about 15 minutes, then the reality of the purchase sets in. The normal $5 asking price isn't high, but its still way too much for a game that ""released,"" but still feels like an early alpha test. I would not advise anyone to buy it unless you have the cash to burn.			"

												 I miss tactical shooters so much it kinda hurts. I wanted to believe so badly that this game would be fun despite bad reviews, because the tactical shooter was my genre, and ever since its downfall gaming just hasnt been  the same. So i buy the game, thankfully on sale, get into the screen and the game crashes. Ok.. start again and go to my loadout screen. After about 5 minutes with the sluggish ui and bland selection i save and go to start a game and the first thing i notice is there is no campaign. Ok... so i decide on the first map, thinking chronologically. The game just loads up, no team loadout screen, no planning phase, not even a whiteboard diagram of the building were assaulting. No intel to help decide on loadout. Ok... Start the mission and the weapon i have is not what i picked at all, it was the basic mp5 starter setup. WTF... Decide to play on, start scouring the keybaord to find some team controls...... none. Not only can you NOT control your team, but they sem to work against you. I went down the stairs with them and apparently noone was checking our six, since when I got to the bottom i noticed noone was following me. I go back up the stairs and see my 3 teammates all flat on their faces, with a tango just standing there not even noticing me. A perfect metaphor for the state of this game as well as the integrity of the devs. And after i back out i find it goes on and on. You cant see or access your loadouts from anywhere but the games main menu,    No ROE or any tyoes of control, no idea where youre going or what your doing, Crashes every time I play it. This game is a disrespectful slap in the face to consumers, and I can only hope an act so foul causes the universe to plague the devs with infinite misery.			"

Product received for free
												A pretty poor Rainbow Six clone. Broken, unfinished and abandoned. The difference between what they said they intended to do and what they actually released is a bit surprising. Serellan LLC is either very cynical or quite self-deluded about the quality of their product. If you are making a game, make it but dont release  half broken, at least make sure your game is 99% done.			"

												Rough around the edges.  Did not live up to hype, or even close. This is a terrible, unfinished mess. This game will go down in history as one of the worst crowd-funded indie games ever. It is the Atari E.T. of indie games. Many were following this game's development for over a year. The developer has released an alpha product and is selling it as a finished game. It most certainly is not. AVOID THIS GAME.			"

												This game is NOT recommendable to buy, the description describes a nice game, but it does not describe this game. Firstly it isn't finished yet, but that is not the main problem. The Single-player is awful, you have no tactical options, you cant give precise orders to your NPC-Mates (like “Rush that room”). If you look for a game like the SWAT Series of Sierra, then you are wrong here. Your only way to play the Single player is to kill the terrorists, like in every CoD campaign mode. Maybe in Coop or in multi player this game  can show its good sides. But there are server/connection problems. I tried on different days now and couldn't connect a single time in any game online. I can just recommend to wait until this game is some when finished and maybe good or until another good tactic Shooter appears before you spend your money here (even if its on sale its not worth the money)			"

TAKEDOWN: RED SABRE: OFFICIAL GAMESPY REVIEW FOR THE YEAR 2020people gave the devs over 200,000 dollars on kickstarter to develop this game. someone saw fit to donate 7500+ dollars so the creative director could fly to his hometown and host a takedown LAN party. instead of tossing their cash to, i don't know, the local humane society or the soup kitchen, they decided it was better to throw the devs hundreds of thousands of dollars so that they could later spend 15 dollars on a game that basically doesn't existturns out the people clamouring for a new ""thinking-man's shooter"" were actually gigantic idiots !!! yowza !!! talk about irony !!!

												I didn't listen to the reviews and I bought the game... I ended up on the fence about how I feel about this game. I bought the game, which is currently $1.50, and I wasn't expecting much, so in the end I found the game to be fun and enjoyable. Knowning that this game was subpar beforehand made me find the game funny and quirky instead of horrible and buggy. The bugs in this game make it more fun and more playable then if it was without bugs, in my opinion. In the end i thought it was worth the buck 50, but I wouldn't spend much more than that.			"

												This game is the absolute biggest turd I have ever played.. It's unworthy of the term ""tactical"" as the AI has X-ray vision and immaculate aiming. The netcode is completely screwed, can't keep a connection in coop at all and even though VOIP is turned off, you still broadcast constantly. The entire game is clunky and slow, until you encounter an enemy, for they will shoot you in the face within .01 seconds.I paid euro 1,34 for it and I feel wallet♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I really wnated to enjoy this game. I've been itching for a tactical game since Rainbow 6 and though this would be the one. Turns out this is just a big ol'♥♥♥♥♥♥fest. I joined a server and as we spawned I could hear the AI enemies calling us out. Even though they magically knew where we were they are also just as stupid as playing Fallout with -100 intelligence. We would all die within 30 seconds descending stairs because they could shoot through the stairwell, or if we managed to make to a hallway they could shoot through shut.. yes SHUT STEEL ♥♥♥♥ING DOORS. Mind you this is all one shot deaths. The AI has this ability to beam shot you through objects but if you manage to sneak past all they do is stand still and yell jibberish. The graphics are horrible, as is the sound, movements / animations, and overall gameplay. Nothing about this game is fun or exciting. If I could score this game it would be: 0.5/10 Only awarding 0.5 because the game actually launches.I love ""hard"" games they require skill and patience ie: Red Orchestra, Dark Souls ect. and this is just flat out a horrible excuse for a paid product.

												This game is horrendous. Do not buy it. I cannot properly enumerate the reasons not to buy this game. Really, it's easier to list reasons why it's good, because there are none. The graphics are poor, the sound is awful, and has no direction to it, the attempts at ""realism"" either result in people being bulletproof, or dropping from one 9mm round to the foot (don't get me started on the human turtles that are the characters in this game- seriously, the movement speeds are atrociously slow), and the AI is some of the worst I've ever seen. I thought all of these were signs of a game very early in development when I first bought this game. This game is the same thing today as it was in pre-alpha. The whole effort at development was a fraud, perpetrated by charlatans. Everything claimed by the company staff was either wildly misinformed or made-up. I, seriously, have not seen a single more duplicitous or non-trasparent project in my entire life. The dishonesty and awful quality Takedown and its developers, as ridiculous as this may sound, actually make me angry (yes, I'm getting mad over a game). With an absolute absence of business ethics or competence, Serellan has managed to both make the worst game I've ever seen, and earn my contempt. Please, do yourself a favor and don't buy this.

I played the game for maybe 30 mins maybe I had issues getting into games and once I got into games it became extermly boring waiting for the round to end! and once it ended after watching people walk around for about 5 minutes because you cant sprint! I got to play now the comunity was usually a buch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s I was open to them and they became very anti new players and drove me away and disscouraged playing with them, this completely ruined the game which could have been good had there been a faster walk or sprint function because It was far too slow, So if your looking at buying this game I strongly Disscourage that you wont get your time out of it and you'll regret playing it! and the people you play with are just rude and make the game even worse!

Does Exist a Limit for ""BAD""? [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I am one of the few guys that got the game KNOWING how bad it was, just to be sure it was bad for real. You should be happy knowing that I wasn't disappointed!I think this game should be played by every developer out there just to let they know how to NOT make a game. When your boy come home from school with a bad score, buy him this game and force him playing for a full day: it is a harsh punishment. But let's talk about the negative points:1. Graphics is more than horrible, I have seen better GameCube games.2. Changing gun and reloading it is slow as hell - this is not an assault team, it's a physical impaired team.3. Enemies are dumbest than a brainless monkey but still they can hear you from 6 rooms of distance and can teleport near you without damage.4. Online is dead: 4 server, 2 of them are empty and 1 has an outdated client.5. People playing it are a**holes: I have been teamkilled 2 seconds from the start, no report, no warning, no kicking out, no penalties.6. Even only spectating a gameplay does led to bugs!7. The developers knows how bad it is: they give you 1 free copy for every purchase. It seems like they wanted to say: ""sorry for buying it, we can't fix it, please take this gift and give it to your worst enemy"".Please do not let my play time count fool you: I only managed to play this game for 20 minutes, then I left it idling for cards (steam trading cards is the only positive point of this game).p.s. The response to the first question is: ""after playing this game, it has been lowered"".Best played with Monitor OffRecommended Buy Price < 0$Score 2/10 "

												When checking the screenshots you will notice Takedown: Red Sabre does look OK and indeed some of the maps are pretty, but then you start playing.... The game tries to be a multiplayer version of Rainbow Six, which is a good thing. When you first join a server you immediately notice the clunky controlls and buggy feel of the game and it makes you want to instantly quit the game. To be honest I've only played like 2/3 rounds, so yes I did not see every map and every game mode, but at that time there were only 2 other players playing. "

The game has absolutely no bugs, this is one of the most stable games I have ever seen. The writing and storytelling easily tops games like HL2 or Heavy Rain. The gameplay is like nothing you have seen before, it is like you are actually shooting that M4A1, firefights get so intense with all of the different mechanics the game has to simulate gun battles. Finally, the graphics are virtually photrealistic and yet it is so well-optimized that I can play it on my 5 year old laptop. THE DEVELOPER EVEN GAVE ME AN EXTRA COPY! WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?			"

												The AI in this game is in serious need of attention. If a bot sees you, you'll be lucky if you didn't die instantly. Bots seem to ignore the rules that players need to follow (they can see through ledges and corners, can shoot and kill anything in line of sight). Co-op is pretty much not an option for this reason, it's unplayable as it is.Finer aspects of this game (like in-game chat, weapon balancing, and player movement) only shine through when you're playing multiplayer versus, where it's actually possible to enjoy this game a little. However, all of these things are still in dire need of a lot more polish.The maps in this game are really cool. Aside from looking unique, most of them are clearly designed to have easily identifiable areas. It's all wasted potential now, though.The basic ideas behind this game are great, but the execution is shameful. It wouldn't have taken a whole lot more to make this game into something really worthwhile. The game has been on sale in its current state for far longer than is excusable. It should serve as one more example of what not to do when making a video game.			"

												I gotta say it's surprising to see all of those review quotes in the little promo video they have. ""A visceral experience""? Did they even play this game?I play a lot of Tactical Shooter games, I'd say they're my favorite genre. But Takedown: Red Sabre doesn't deliver and really just leaves you wanting something similar but actually finished.It's buggy, it barely runs, the game itself is lackluster. The core elements to a potentially good Tactical Shooter like SWAT and Rainbow 6 are here, but it's been abandoned with zero chance of being found again and actually made into a *game*.To add insult to injury, they gave out like... five free copies awhile back, and I could barely stomach giving it to anyone. Save yourself the trouble, and give this a hard pass.			"

												This game is not nearly as bad as the reviews make it seem. Maybe they fixed a lot in the new patch, I wouldn't know as I just started playing it. AI isn't genius but it isn't too terrible and is just challenging enough to make each game interesting. AI's spawn at start instead of at triggered locations which is something I missed from the old Rainbow Six games. There is a lack of weapons which hopefully will be added later on but it is by no means a game breaker. Also the MP5 (M5 in game) is much more innacurate than it is in real life. I enjoy this game quite a bit all things considered. The M4 and ACOG (Combat Optic) are both well done, better than I've found in many games and I know this for a fact since I got a lot of experience with both during my time in the military. I'd give it a 7.5/10, definitely worth a buy during a sale!			"

												So I posted a thread asking whether Takedown: Red Sabre  was any good because I was hoping it would scratch my itch for a slow paced old-school Rainbow 6 shooter. Everyone said that it was♥♥♥♥♥♥and a huge disappointment and that it was a waste of even the $1 that it's worth even now on Steam.However, there was one guy who posted a screenshot of his playtime in the game (about 26 hours iirc) and said that everyone itt was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that it was actually fun. This guy singlehandedly convinced me to buy it anyway and ignore the circlejerk.I'm very glad that I did.During my first 3 hours of gameplay I decided to write a list of +s and -s about the game, coming at it from a low-expectation and is-this-game-like-rainbow-6 perspective.spoiler alert: it was exactly what i hoped it would beThe following is my list of +s and -s about Takedown: Red Sabre based on my experiences with the game. I am a very old school Rainbow 6 player and I came into this game with very low expectations due to the Total Biscuit review (and later PSA), random internet people's advice and opinions about the game. One thing I want to be clear about here, though, is that I am not the kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about cosmetic♥♥♥♥♥♥like sexy reload animations, graphics, et cetera. Imo all of these things are completely fine. They're not as good as ArmA 3 or Skyrim but they don't take away from my experience at all.---While checking this game out and making this list, I fully was wearing my Rainbow 6, Rogue Spear, SWAT 4, and Raven Shield hats and I try to make direct comparisons to each of those games as often as I can in this list for you:(these are in the order I wrote them down while playing the game)+ Level editor (not even Tribes has this) is exactly like the old Raven Shield one (because they're based on the same engine), which is way ♥♥♥♥ing better than the old Rogue Spear one. This is a huge plus for me because I love making custom♥♥♥♥♥♥in games and then playing them with my friends.+ 3 game modes across 13 different maps by default (however the Mission game mode limits the pool to only 5)+ Mirrors and glass in general actually ♥♥♥♥ing works -- there are genuine reflections that you can use to see people around corners, such as when on the top floor of the Biolab where you can see enemies under your feet by looking at the tall windows.+ Gimping works just like in the old Rainbow 6 games.+ AI is just as good at shooting as you are (assuming that you don't suck at crosshair placement and aiming), but only when they're alerted to your presence. It's exactly like Rainbow 6, except instead of multiple difficulty settings (Recruit, Veteran, Elite) each AI has its own difficulty settings. Some are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cowardly whereas others are 360 noscope mlg xxx tier. Either extreme is very rare (maybe 1 per mission) and most AI are probably in between Raven Shield's Veteran and Elite difficulties imo.+ Atmosphere is just like the old Rainbow 6 games (e.g. rooftop biolab insertion feels exactly like the Raven Shield Penthouse insertion zone).+ You die in 1 hit most of the time unless you equip heavy armor, in which case you can take 2~5 hits. This is exactly the same as in each of the old Rainbow 6 games. It depends on where you were hit and the caliber of the gun that the guy who shot you has. HOWEVER, unlike in the old Rainbow 6 games, when you wear Heavy armor you are not allowed to sprint (default: LCtrl) anymore. imo that's completely fine.+ Hit detection on narrow edges (like shooting through doorways at tight angles) are exactly the same as in Raven Shield -- presumably because they're built with the same engine.- When you die, you don't get any feedback about your stats or whatever (e.g. accuracy, how many kills you got, et cetera).- There's no indication of how many enemies in total you're up against. Because of this, you can easily get bored running circles around the map searching for the last guy.+ The game can only be done slowly, so it's just like Rainbow 6. imo, it's even slower than that, though -- I'll explain why I think this later on down this list.+ The relationship between accuracy and movement feels exactly the same as in the old Rainbow 6 games (but it goes out the window when you scope in or use ironsights, which did technically exist in the old Rainbow 6 games because you could still zoom a little even without a scope anyway -- it just didn't look like that once they introduced first person weapon models in Raven Shield).- It lacks certain functionality that people consider ""basic"" or ""essential"" nowadays (e.g. being able to change options while in the middle of a mission) but weren't exactly taken for granted back in the old Rainbow 6 days. Most ♥♥♥♥♥♥s on the internet seem to judge a book by its cover, so to speak, and so they look at this lack of ""basic"" functionality in the menus and just drop the game completely and tell everyone it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. In my opinion, people who do this can go suck a♥♥♥♥♥♥- TotalBiscuit complained about how there are only 3 graphical settings in his review videos, but tbh I don't care because I get 60fps on my old laptop with Medium and Low settings... and all 3 settings don't take away from my gameplay experience at all so imo he's just nitpicking on that point, at least).+ It *FEELS* like I'm playng a modern Rogue Spear game, except the pace is slower (tbh Rainbow 6 and Rogue Spear both were very fast paced in terms of movement and it wasn't until Raven Shield that they slowed it down, which I loved personally... but this game slows it down even more while still letting you run and sprint through clear areas at the old Rainbow 6 and Rogue Spear running speeds, so I'm 100% cool with this and won't list it as a minus).+ Sound *ACTUALLY MATTERS* in this game, similar to how it matters in CounterStrike (although for different reasons). The AI will even hear you if you so much as switch to your grenades! In my opinion, this is a huge step up from all of the old Raven Shield games. Whereas in the old Rainbow 6 games, you can run around with Heavy Armor and it makes no significant difference to how the AI detects you... in this game you can actually see very easily how the AI reacts to your movements, even through walls and doors. All of this makes the gameplay slow down even more, which makes me much happier personally because that's how tactical shooters are supposed to be played in the first ♥♥♥♥ing place!+ You can choose multiple insertion zones both in Single AND in Multiplayer. In the old Rainbow 6 games, you could only do this in a few special missions for single player... but *NEVER* for multiplayer. This is a big plus for me because in Multiplayer you can divide your team into actual separate groups that start in completely different areas of the map.- There is no 2D map or anything for the missions you can play. You have to learn them as you go. This isn't a big minus for me, personally, but it is definitely a minus. It means that only people with enough experience can actually plan ahead, which takes away from the fun for me. It adds a sense of exploration to the game, true, but I don't think that this sort of thing is appropriate for this kind of game.- No pre-mission planning phase at all. The old Rainbow 6 games never did this for multiplayer, of course, but it was at least there in Single Player. Ultimately, though, it's not that big of a deal I guess but I'd still like to be able to do it in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer. It only adds to the fun of the game and doesn't take anything away at all imo.+ There is a decent selection of weapons and gadgets (which is what the game calls grenades and stuff). You can't give yourself a High Capacity mag like in Raven Shield (thank you jesus I never liked that feature anyway back then because it made the gameplay speed up unnecessarily since you hardly ever had to worry about taking cover to reload).

At least those for free! Or with some luck, wait for SWAT4 for Steam. (who knows?) Now that would be awesome!Graphics okay, doesn't matter much, peeking is a little bit lame (comparing to any other games),Multiplayer: didn't seen anyone plays this ""game"".Overall: do not buy it!

												If you love and enjoy tactical FPS games like the old Tom Clancy Rainbow Six games and you aren't a graphic♥♥♥♥♥♥you'll enjoy this, I saw all the negative comments so I was edgy to buy it so I watched reviews and I decided to have a swing. After buying it I bought one for my brother and we both love tactical FPS games and this really hit home for us, it was a great addition to add multiplayer co-op. It's intense and requires a lot of teamwork, so what if the graphics aren't ""Crysis"" it is still really enjoyable, I do not regret buying it.You don't die to easy, it's realistic, do you really think that the enemies would hire dumbasses without training? It's not CoD or Battlefield, you're not the ""Hero"" like the other games portray, you're a regular HUMAN swat member who dies in a couple of shots if not one to the head. I'm not saying it's perfect but it is what it says it is.It'd be nice though to tell your teammates where to go, at the moment you can just say Stop, Regroup and RoE Offensive, Defensive. It's a really enjoyable game and I hope they keep updating it and adding stuff! (Adding Achievements, guns, missions, etc)			"

												This game is pure garbage and so are Serillion for ripping people off. As far as I can tell, this is the first project they've ever created on their own outside of 505 Games. They don't accept being criticised and ban those that do here on Steam as if they are gods or something. Their website is full of disgruntled people wanting their money back and yet, Serillion refuses to refund them. The Steam forum has over 38 pages of dissatisfied clients all wanting their money back. I do go overboard at times with my attitude but to receive a permanent ban for a game that I spent MY money on for them to be able to continue development of their game is pure ignorance on their part not to mention, stealing money from me for a game I cannot even play anymore of which, I was playing it until their last update that claims my video card is no good. HA! I can play any and every other game out today on todays market without any problem and yet Serillion games I cannot?! What kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is that?

												I would usually take a chance like this to be ironic and sarcastic as possible. But not with this ♥♥♥♥ing game. First off, I have only played this game for like fifteen minutes, and in throughout that entire experience, I wanted to put a bullet in my face after every thirty seconds. I bought a 4-pack of the game for my friends and I and thought ""Why not?"". However it was a huge ♥♥♥♥ing mistake not to read the reviews. I got in the game with my friends and I, and my first thought was ""Wow, walking feels kind of funky."" So then I shot a simple bullet, but my gun didn't even have any firing animation. I just kept shooting bullets into a wall and I had no way to tell. But that was fine. I walked down literally one flight of steps, turned to the left, and died. I thought ""Ok, he had the jump on me, I will be more aware next time."" So, I respawned, and walked through a door. Then, a single AI turned around instantly, shot me twice, and killed me. So this game must have the AI of ♥♥♥♥ing Far Cry 1 and combined with the difficulty of Dark Souls. Don't buy this game, yes, it is cheap, but I doubt .50 cents would be a fair deal for this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hellhole.			"

The campaign doe not feel like a campaign and to be honest i think this was a college project. It makes no sense to me that someone would publish a undevelpoed game, and call it finished.

												This game is a piece of utter garbage. AI is unbelieveably stupid, yet some how manages to slaughter you and your team instantly. They sniped me from 300 feet, with a submachine gun while I had heavy armor. There's no point in using silencers, they can see you and hear you no matter where you are, and they call every NPC on the map to you.Your teammates are the WORST. When you die, they stand still while they wait for you to transfer to one of them. That means when you're taking 5 seconds to take controll, the enemies have the time to kill everyone, AND THEY WILL. They also get in your way constantly.The AI sucks, you die with a single shot to the chest even in heavy armor, even from a pistol.The reload breaks, you have unlimited ammo, and the controls are garbage.This was released as a ""finished"" game, and I have played alphas that are better made than this trashy heap of freaking garbage.

												Where to begin...It's always a good sign when a game starts off with, ""I really don't know where to begin with this game."" I bought this game during a sale for right around $1 and thought I had stumbled onto a good deal. After all, a game with steam trading cards grants some merit, right? Wrong. There are sooo many things wrong with this game. The menus and options screens are difficult to maneuver and clunky, the AI in this game is terrible, and the half the time you have no idea what you should do. The game just throws you into the menu, not really forcing you into training or explaining how to maneuver the menus to change character class or loadout. Pretty much everything is trial and error, with the training (that I eventually completed) not really being helpful at all. I give this game 0 pieces of crap out of 5 gold stars.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! NO PRICE IS WORTH IT!			"

												This game is great if you're down for mandatory stealth-like shooters that strip you of the ability to jump, turn at any realistic rate, and die in a single hit. Honestly, this game has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It's like playing Devil May Cry on Hell and Hell difficulty the first time you've ever played a melee-POV action game without being able to use Ebony & Ivory or Rebellion. You are punished heavily for using weapons via the recoils and you are constantly put in situations where you have threats from multiple sides and die before you can see all of them. My biggest qualm with this game is that you die in a single shot while wearing a fully armored combat raid suit and the stealth they are oh-so-focused on doesn't mean a damn thing.TL;DR: Don't buy this game.

												A brilliantly hyped piece of complete garbage.  If you can manage to convince it to run, the prolonged character customization will trick you into believing this is actually a game.  It is not.  It is the distilled essence of failure, wrapped up in shiny labels and an appeal to an underserved market cynically crafted to to con as many people as possible out of their money before they have a chance to see it for themselves.  There is nothing good about it.  The AI is awful, the guns feel like Hasbro toys if they were dipped in molten lead instead of paint, and the graphics are somehow uglier than much older, theoretically less advanced games.  The only good thing about it is that it has the good grace to crash frequently, sparing the user from having to play more of it.  I pre-ordered it, played it, and then gave up and uninstalled it before forgetting about it until now, desperate not to remember this horrible product.  The only thing that could save it would be a refund.			"

My friend left the message ""Its a good Game :D""He had like 1.5 Hrs playtime in that game.I didn´t really looked at the Pictures or Videos of it, I just got this as a Random Gift and was like ""hey, cool. Free Game.""Installed, Started, Cried.Graphics? You cant call this Graphics. This is even worse than 144p.Gameplay? Ugh, Werid Controls, Dumb Teammates and OP enemies.Thats about it. I played it for like 10 minutes in total. It has no ranking system/level ups or any stuff to unlock (I think) and it has no Campaign. So its not even worth it.By the way, if you buy it, you get 2 Copies. thats why I got this as a gift. and if you get this as a gift (or trade, just if you have it redeemed) you get another Copy aswell (atleast I got another one, not sure if it was a Bug or not)so if you hate someone, Gift him this game and leave a message saying ""Its a Good Game :D"", like my Friend did.

												This in my opinion, is a classic among tactical shooters such as Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon and SWAT. The cause of the influx of bad reviews are from players who went into the game expecting a COD or Battlefield playstyle. They were soreley wrong. This is a textbook tactical shooter. The fact that its almost dead is a crime due to consumers not being able to have induvidual opinons of their own.  Bad reviews equals no buy. Reviews are but a component of a purchasing desicion, the others  should be research, evaluation in lets plays or articles and person taste. This was not how it was done. I consider this a classic in tactical shooters and is one of my favorite games. I only wish it could have beccome a franchise. Sadly, this generation wants games that literally hold their hand, shame.			"

												If you ever played SWAT 4, this is the same thing, but done badly. You will die often, and a lot, and your teammates will die as well, because the AI in this game is a better aim than Wild Bill. The only way to play is to predict where the enemy will be based on where they were last time, and spray wildly in that direction. I say wildly because your aimed shots will miss just as often, especially with the heavier calibers, even on single fire. I get the feeling whoever made this didn't spend much time actually firing weapons, as recoil generally is well compensated for by the body, it's kind of why guns have stocks and so on. Professional shooters utilize techniques such as wrapping their arms through the weapons siling to further minimize the effects of recoil and to tighten up aim. None of this is reflected here.I bought it knowing it would be bad, but it's not ""so funny you can laugh at it"" bad, it's just ""Oh, the guy that's been on the screen for a few milliseconds headshotted me, and his burst killed two of my teammates"" bad.

												I backed this on Kickstarter two years ago (April 2012). It was launched in the last part of September 2013, with an average of 88 players online. Within a month, it dropped to about 16 players on average and is has been an average of 7 players ever since. according to Steamcharts[steamcharts.com].As of this writing, I just logged in to see if I could get a pick-up game (even though the game-play is rather buggy and miserable). What I found were two game modes with no servers and no players. I found one game mode, deathmatch, which had one twelve-player server . . . with zero players.It has the base components for a game that could be decent, with a whole lot of work, time, and many iterations. Unfortunately, with a player-base big enough to stuff in a phone booth, it is unlikely that anything is going to come of this game. Yet another regretted crowdfunding game project.Even if you're fine with significant bugs and brokenness, it is impossible to recommend something at any price that doesn't have anyone you can play the game with.

												Let me try to give a balanced review:  some of the shooty gameplay is actually fun.  I came back to this for almost 15 hours because it was kind of fun to see if I could complete any of the missions despite...well.  The innumerable problems with the game.So, fun aside, I have no idea how Serellan took an existing game engine (Unreal?) and managed to make it do things like lose the connection to the host while playing SINGLE PLAYER or not have a working game browser until several patches in.  Extremely basic design decisions are poorly done:  how might you handle weapons loadouts?  Customize before each mission?  Not in this game!  You chose four loadouts from the main menu, differentiated only by their names, and then chose those by name (what did I make the Assault loadout again?) when going into a mission.  (EDIT 12/27:  oh joy!  You can edit the loadouts at the mission jump-off screen!  But you're still editing the four choices...then choosing one.........idiots...)  Your team members never changed weapons, so the one guy was always carrying a sniper rifle, even through urban hallways.  That might've mattered if the team AI did much more than absorb bullets or mutter things like ""rounds downrange""--you have basically no control over them except to ask for them not to follow you, and even if they're supposed to sometimes their pathing will fail and they'll get stuck.  Ultimately, they were only useful as extra lives--except that their loadouts couldn't be customized, so eventually YOU were the idiot stuck with the sniper rifle while trying to do CQB.I wanted badly for this game to be good, but it wasn't.

First of all here are my PC specs: i7-4770 at 3.9 Ghz, 12GB DDR3 RAM. 1TB 7500 RPM HDD, nvidia gtx 645 w/ 1GB RAm.  This is a gaming capable pc.  I max out almopst every game on high settings, including this game.  But about every 10 minutes into the game, the framerate goes down to 2.  And crashes.  It has game brteaking bugs and glitches, the AI sucks a massive♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons are all the same, and online matches are completely broken.  Now again, I like the concept of a hardcore FPS, and thats why I bought the game.  Luckily only fpr $1.50 on sale.  When, the games works, it provides about 5 minutes of fun.  Now, i know this is suposed to be a hard game, but it is near to impossible.  It took hours of trying the first mission to beat it, as there is always one guy who shoots all of you teammates, because their AI sucks. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  IT HASNT BEEN UPDATIED FOR EVER, AND IS STILL IN ALPHA.  IT WILL PROBABLY STAY THAT WAY FOREVER.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!			"

												I hate to do this because the devs obviously worked hard on this but this game is rushed, unfinished and unpolished in the extreme. Having worked with UE3 before their lack of knowledge on basic engine functions astounds me. Furthermore the game simply refuses to work in MP and SP will often disconnect you for no reason. There is no VOIP and the game lacks any steam community functionality at all. The menus are a mess (e.g. they don't allow you to change options while in game) and the entire thing wreaks of a project that was pushed out the door because the devs realized there was no salvaging the project. This might be worth 5/10 if you can actually connect to play with friends otherwise i'm giving this 1/10 for actually being able to run but other than that this is a game in pre-alpha state.			"

												As a Reviewer I try my hardest to find the good things about any game, wether it be good, or bad, and try to be as fair, rational,  intellectual, and informative as possible, while trying to keep a fairly positive and upbeat demeanor in giving my critique.And after only a few hours of this game I can safely say, while it may not be as ""Horrid"" as most people would put it, as I have played WAAAAY worse, this game unfortunately sits at the kids table in consideration of the quality of this highly touted Tactical Shooter.I along with many others were expecting this game to be pretty cool, as it at least had some people who had worked on Ghost Recon 2 and Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 1 and 2, so I of course thought ""Wow this game has some talent behind it, it looks interesting, glad to see a methodical shooter instead of most of the action based nonsense we usually get.""But sadly that was not the case.While it may have looked promising in it's preview stages, it just seems that the game never really left that phase.Were to begin? Well for starters, how about the fact that the game has ♥♥♥♥-all in regards to PC Settings as most of them seemed to be lacking, especially  like the  Display Settings where there is no options other than, Screen resolution and graphics settings of :Low, Medium, and High.The controls are somewhat ehh...I mean the sensitivy for the mouse feels rather slow for a game that expects you to have the reflexes of that of a cheetah, even at full sensitivity. Leaning is rather useless as all it really does is bend side to side from the waist up instead of, you know, LEANING WITH YOR ENTIRE BODY, making looking around corners more of a hassle than it needs to,so I practically don't even use that feature at all. Weapon damage is rather inconsistent at times as at times 2-3 shots to the chest will be enough, while sometimes you can shoot point blank at someones chest with no armor, with BUCKSHOT, and they'll still keep chuggin.The disturbing absense of Squad Commands feels very wrong for a ""Tactical Shooter"". I mean Squad commands have been present in most if not all Tactical shooters, and no I don't count Halting Your Squad mates, and just saying random phrases like ""Going on Offensive"" or ""Going on Defensive"" as being as remotely helpful as it generally does nothing, hell even Ghost Recon: Future Soldier had Squad commands! And that was more of a action third person Shooter!And the above problems don't help when the AI is rather inconsistent...what do I mean by that you ask? Well when the Enemy is so stupid as to stare at a corner all day, looking in the absolute wrong direction they should logically expect you to be coming from, walking directly past you even when you are firing point blank in their face, to being so alert as to know that you were to come out through a door on a balcony after killing one of my squad mates on the bottom floor, shooting me in the face with disturbingly accurate accuracy in one shot, when logically there was no reason to know I was going to come out from there, HELL, sometimes the enemies will know I'm behind a door, even though they didn't hear me, or see me going through the door yet...seriously are some of the enemies psychic?The same also applies to your squad mates too. If they aren't really hyper aware and getting really accurate shots killing the enemies really quickly, they are either NOT shooting the enemies and are just shouting that theres an enemy soldier coming right at them, while they are looking Straight at them, not firing a bullet, usually resulting in very crappy and hilariously awful deaths, or WORSE, getting you stuck in a corner, keeping you captive until you put a bullet in one of their skulls, which surprisingly they don't retaliate for.The Graphics is...Alright, it at least looks serviceable at High Setting, but the worst thing about the presentation has to be the animations...I mean, I get some serious X Operations vibes just looking at them walk, it's just un-natural.and after all that, was there anything good about this game...well, I liked the fact that you had to be mindful of how long your weapon is in consideration to the walls adding a layer of strategic thinking, but even with that...no, I have nothing really good to say about this game...The most cardinal sin about this game is that fact that this game was released in a very poor, and rather unfinished state. Like most people have said, it does feel like an early alpha state game...the lack of modes and maps should be an indication of that, and the fact that Serrellan after all the money they got on kickstater, and then getting partnered with 505 games to puplish the game, and to just release the game, in THIS state, is just un-acceptable.It's so dissapointing to see such potential go to waste, as the guys at Serrellan obviously were proud of this game, and work was put into it.Like I said before, this game isn't as awful as some people make it to be, but would I say it's good, no...If I had to give a short review of this game, I would simply put: ""Takedown: Red Sabre is like a dumb 4 year old eating crayons....it may seem adorable, but it doesn't cover up the fact it♥♥♥♥♥♥it'self.""

												Reading through Takedown: Red Sabre's Kickstarter page may give the impression that the game is a spiritual successor to classic PC shooters like Rainbow Six and SWAT4. Instead, like Tom Clancy's imagining of the submarine Red October, the threat of this game engages the player with little to no warning.The idea behind Takedown is a throwback to the classic era of PC tactical first-person shooters, but the desire to perform any form of tactic is tossed aside to make way for frustrating gameplay, unrealistic AI and disappointing physics. My first playthrough began with a member of my team relentlessly crouching and standing upright in an endless wave of teabagging while enemies sprayed bullets in our direction. Squadmates often stand in place like cardboard cutouts as enemies assault only to suddenly become active and return fire a few seconds after combat begins. I've had some enemies outright ignore me for nearly a minute after I accidentally sprint into them. Grenades bounce off of objects and sometimes launch across rooms as if they were thrown onto a trampoline, and enemies sometimes launch into the air or soar across a room when killed.Bad AI is Takedown's most crippling issue. Explosions don't tip them off to enemy presence. Flashbangs seem to be low-grade sparklers to them. They would rather stare at walls than pursue enemies and they often choose to shuffle around in a circle before engaging the player. Enemies can sometimes spot the player seemingly by looking through objects, yet they sometimes walk by a door where the player is in plain sight without a single reaction.The game's graphics are very rough, and the overall visuals look incomplete. Some weapons lack fire animations. Enemies look like an alpha build of characters from a mid-2000s game instead of a product from 2013. Anyone expecting top notch, or even acceptable, graphics from Takedown will be disappointed. Areas in a single mission often look recycled and uninspired. This can become especially troublesome if you become lost and can't remember what floor you're on. Most other shooter games would have the player press the “M” key and dissolve the confusion, but there is no key to bring up a map in Takedown.Stage objectives are challenging and fun to attempt, but the frustration from bad AI and no map assistance kills the mood. Some objectives like “destroy PC disk drives” are entirely too obscure. I discovered how to complete this objective by aimlessly firing in an office for no reason and struck a PC tower by accident. A room filled with large, standup computers was introduced before the office room was, so I was frantically trying to discover how to destroy these disk drives. The player normally interacts with objectives by holding the shift key, so changes in how objectives are completed introduced a great deal of confusion.Players may choose to customize layouts in order to choose primary and secondary weapons, grenades and breach charges; but customization often yields little change. I never felt like using a different weapon mattered much. The true difference came when I chose scopes over red sights, but I abandoned worrying about either after shooting enemies spot on in the abdomen only to have them scurry away unscathed and aimlessly charge up and down flights of stairs. Flashbang grenades leave enemies unharmed and hardly alert. Nearby explosions from frag grenades resulted in enemies staying in the same position, admiring the walls that enemies often stare at rather than reacting like a person would.Takedown offers Mission, Bomb Disarm and Tango Hunt modes of play. Bomb Disarm and Tango Hunt could arguably be more enjoyable than Mission, but the same issues haunt these alternate modes of play. These modes are made worse than Mission because a player's squad is reduced to one. It then becomes quicker to be killed, quicker to be overwhelmed by several bad guys so one random shot can instantly kill the player, and quicker to realize that the noise suppressor accessory for the weapons is garbage. If the idea behind Takedown is to be a spiritual successor to old games like Rainbow Six or other tactical, team-based shooters, then the idea of reducing a team to one to defuse bombs or to take out an enemy team is absolutely befuddling.Takedown: Red Sabre is a good concept's stage show of poor execution. The project's potential can certainly be felt and understood, but the likeliness of such potential surfacing – even through patches – is low. To call the Takedown project lazy would be harsh, but it wouldn't be inaccurate. The goals for this project were laid out in the open both in the Kickstarter campaign and on the game's official website, but very little victory can be tasted in this final product. Couple a disappointing experience with a $14.99 price tag, and you have arguably the most disappointing video game to be funded by a Kickstarter campaign.			"

												Despite the overall negative reviews i did enjoy playing this game. Takedown: Red Sabre is a very hard solo / co-op shooter. You take control of a member of an Anti-Terror Unit and are sent out to complete various mission on different maps. Terrorist Hunt, Bomb Defusal [...]. You will only have as much HUD as needed. No extra map, no extra health, just you and your weapon. Enemies and players go down quite fast, sometimes even in 1 shot. This makes the game very challenging and drives a lot of players away. The key to winning is playing slow and tactical, but that is something which has been lost over all the years... Loadout customization is ok, but nothing special. The game is only 3 years old, but lacks a bit visual wise. Why do i recommend it? Because it is fun, challenging and a great co-op game. If you are alone or don't like slow combat, don't bother.			"

												Cosidering my tastes, this game immediatly attracted my attention. When I got it though, nearly every feature was incomplete or utterly broken. After the game was fixed, however, a few positive points came about. Pros: Good Fiream handling, Costomability ect.Other than that, this game clearly lacks content, the AI is attrocious, and the maps are punitive. Ragdoll physics are broken as well. In my opinion, it is disapionting to see such good ideas gone wrong. I regret spending $15 on this.			"

												Be aware this game is not a final product. It has a ton of bugs, a pretty simple looking and not even well designed UI. It has just a few weapons and levels as well.The funny fact is when this game was released the folder was called ""Takedown - Early Access""  but it was sold, with tons of bugs, as a finished product. This is what was communicated by the dev team as well. Seriously? They lied. Period. Nobody would have complained if it was cleary sold as early access but this way at least I feel cheated.The only thing in which this game is better than any real tactical shooter is, because it is newer, the graphics. That's it. Nothing else is superior or barly equal to for example Rainbow Six Ravenshield. Get Rainbow Six Ravenshield for a few bucks it is a superior - and more important - a finished product.			"

Short ReviewA supposed comeback for the tactical shooting genre, Takedown: Red Sabre passes selection and completed his training courses, yet when it came to his first real mission, he flopped… Big time.Pretty much the bare basics of a tactical shooter. Awkward menu, horrible AI, mediocre game mechanics and glitches abound. But decent graphics and great level design.Kiddie Steam reviewer verdict: “chnged gun. started game. gun didn’t change. Wnt back. changed gun. game still dusnt register change. carried on. ai squad gt stuck in door. Saw enemy across map with back turned. He turn round and killed me in half a second. Tried multiplayer. Uinable to connect 2 any server. 4/10 wud disconnect agen.”Long ReviewIt’s no secret that games these days are all about your waist high walls, linear objectives and regenerating health. Answering the cry of help from the tactical gaming community, a few industry veterans (who’s work involves that of Ghost Recon, SWAT and Halo) stepped up to the call and decided to create their very own game to resurrect this dying genre. GraphicsThe graphics range from excellent to quite poor. The environment textures look absolutely fantastic and whilst a bit too clean and sterile, offer a pleasing amount of colours and contrasts that make it an absolute shame you have to shoot up the place. It’s a shame there’s no peaceful mode as I would have loved to explore the excellently crafted map.The character models look fantastic! Boasting high polys and great texture work, each character looks like a real life operative who’s been kidnapped and transported into the Unreal engine (bless their poor souls). The character and model artists really know what they’re doing with this one. It’s a shame that characters move like they’re made out of wood and lack any idle animation, resulting in a game of musical statues. I don’t even know if they can blink.On the downside, the weapon and first person view-models look like they were pulled from a game 5 years ago. Much lower poly than you’d expect so appear rigid and angular, plus they also house a number of bad faces that reflect light at odd angles. When you have a stunning environment with life-like character models, but have to stare at your blocky arms and firearm that looks like it was made out of tin foil, it’s pretty jarring to say the least.SoundThe music is pretty good, definitely sets the mood with its militaristic theme. Whilst there isn’t a wealth load of tracks, they’re all done to great effect and tie in well with what you’d expect from a tactical shooter.As for in game sound, well there isn’t much to talk about. Everything seems eerily quiet and doors opening, soldiers screaming, spouts of gunfire is all you’re pretty much going to get. Whilst the guns sound ok, they sure sound generic and lack that looping variation you’d expect from games like Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon.GameplayTakedown: Red Sabre has come a long way since it’s behemoth of a disaster at launch, but sadly it’s still a sordid buggy shell of a game.The menu is basic but seems glitchy at times. Often I’d try to change my equipment, only for it to not register until I realised you have to click on the kit name (recon, assault, etc), then click “save loadout” then click back. At least I think that’s how I did it.Your AI squad waddles behind you like a group of duck, refusing to follow any sort of tactical formation, either choosing to form a conga line or dancing all over the place like frightened cockroaches in a matchbox. Very much like your first puppy, outsides of asking them to follow, sit, attack or stay quiet, there’s pretty much no other use for them except extra lives should you bite the dusts. Moreover, when you get killed in a doorway, they enjoy running straight into the doorway and getting capped themselves.The enemy AI is just as bad. Running around like headless chickens, staring at a shiny wall instead of that door you just blown open… then managing to do a 180 spin and headshot you from across the other side of the map in about 0.23 seconds. Cheap.I have sadly never ever been able to participate in a multiplayer match, thanks to a wide range of “connection problems” and error messages. Having played prior to writing this review, I’m still getting unable to connect to server messages and I still cannot get a LAN game to run. Movement is a little odd as you seem to slide everywhere. You can’t lean very far nor move and lean (which apparently is due to quote “The realistic nature of the game”) even though you could do so in most other tactical shooters.Asides from the terrible AI and connection issues, there is a game here, it’s just very barren. It has its moments of enjoyment and if you can accept the complete package for what it is, it’s not the end of the world. If somehow you manage to win the lottery and spot a pig flying in the air at the same time, get the multiplayer to work (if it still does) and playing with other people should make the game more enjoyable.Final WordsTakedown: Red Sabre is a huge disappointment. Whilst it’s not an absolutely terrible game, it’s far far from a good one either. Having trashed the game on a public article and being called out for having inaccurate info then told by the game developer that many problems have been solved, bottom line is many many problems still remain. Where’s my multiplayer?As for the company behind Takedown: Red Sabre, they’re making a new tactical shooter called Epsilon. The question is, should you support them? I think so!They’ve seemed to have learned from their mistakes and putting all efforts into their new title. I’ve gotten my hands on the alpha and for the price of a 6” Subway, it’s given me great bang for the buck. Still, a few bad lemons are bound to pop up in a box every now and then, so I urge you to check Epsilon out.			"

												No, no, no. Please god no, not another five minutes of this game. THis game is so utterly appaling so smug in it's own failure that it needs to be taken down from Steam.But first let me spin you a little fable.Once upon a time there was a bloke named wolfthing, he had enjoyed one or two of the Rainbow Six Vegas games when he was younger but felt things were missing, like I dunno, TACTICS. Then he learned about SWAT 4 and this made Wolfthing happy, sadly it's not available for legitimate digital download anywhere and as Wolfthing was screwed over by pirates once, he won't pirate it. In his brooding he discovered Takedown: Red sabre and apparently so did one of his friends, who gifted him the game, Wolfthing was happy. Until he pressed Play. After a good 20 minutes of online shennanigins and about 15 of single player crap he quit the game and uninstalled it, creating a new category in his library marked ""Horrible, So Horrible""Now that the scene is set, let me open with this.THIS GAME IS COMPLETE AND UTTER♥♥♥♥♥♥FOR THE LOVE OF GODDONOTBUYITSo about 3 minutes after clicking play I have some issues already, the menu is♥♥♥♥♥♥ like worse than cheap console port♥♥♥♥♥♥ the options aren't the worst I've seen but they leave much to be desired. So I go to join my buddy and I can't. Eventually we find eachother on a public server. Now begins my 20 minutes of online play. I think it's best to describe my thoughts at the time rather than attempt to actually review this.Ok these controls are pretty slow, I guess it is tactical. Oh look I can open doors, but all the rooms are copy pasted, I haven't seen anyone yet, oh hey a bad guy no that's just my reflection, well this is boring, I'm out, peace.Yeah, pretty bad, the single player is much the same except the enemy AI sucks♥♥♥♥♥for a living, it takes a good 2 seconds at least for it to react and any retard can react to him in that time, they never surrender and have deadeye aim when they finally do wake up, meaning you will be insta-killed. Speaking of killed I suppose I should point out the game's only good feature and elaborate on it so I seem fair, when you die to switch to one of your squadmates, it's a brilliant idea and I can't remember PLAYING another game that did it, although I think one of the Brothers in Arms games did. It's great if you need to speedrun a level in order to get through a♥♥♥♥♥♥game as fast as possible but in the end I gave up anyway.The story isn't a story it's a set up, and it works fine. You are a squad of a special forces division of a morally ambigous private military corporation. Basically people hire you to go in and shoot the bad guys before the Police get there and find the Illegal weapons you've been developing for sale to Private states, or the Government as the case may be. And this works fine, it means the game can skip some corners on the whole protocol thing that the SWAT games did. It does mean however with it's gritty black ops feel, you ask yourself why is there an army of deadeye terrorists (Who are apparently just some kind of Pro-humanity protest group in one mission) and noone is taking precautions to stop them?Sadly the game missed out on some base management stuff which I feel would've been kind of cool, having to manage staff, equiipment, the Public opinion, your secrecy and your profit, but that would've required extra work.Work is something the devs seem to have a paralysing fear of as they have released an unfinished game claiming it finished. It's not even a beta it's a ♥♥♥♥ing dev-build they released at 0.8914 or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it is.Seriously don't buy this game, it's♥♥♥♥♥♥on frozen♥♥♥♥♥♥pie. I couldn't even play it for an hour. I don't really like scores in reviews but I'd give this one 0/10 and then add a million zeroes to the 10. Then triple it.			"

												Wow, here's my thoughts on Takedown...First off, key binding is broken.  I always assign my Tab key to reload function in every FPS game. But for some stupid reason, the Tab key is permafixed to console or chat in this one.  That's a deal breaker for me.  Secondly, the lean function appears to be broken. You should be able to stay in that position as you strafe, but you can't, even when you change the toggle in the settings.  Weird.  The gameplay itself was mediocre, nothing really stood out for me. Most everything seemed to be worse than Rainbow Six 3. It kind of a had a similiar feel to that game but everything felt dumber somehow, like I was playing a poor immitation of that game.  If it weren't for the poor controls, I might play around with this more. Overall the game feels very unpolished and unfinished.  Other than being curious masochist (like I was) or as a joke, I can't think of any good reason to play this. Every tactical shooter I've ever played before is better than this.			"

												Ignore the reviews. This game may not be a diamond. But its pretty damn fun to play. With a full team of friends you can have loads of fun. The map design is incredible and there is so many different ways to exectute a mission. 7/10 would play			"

												This game is so good. I literally cannot stop playing it.Here is a list of my favorite things: Bot MechanismSo the bot mechanism for this game is impecable!The bots work fairly well with team play and seem to always have your back.  The developers of this game put a lot of effort into making the teamate bots useful and seem as if they are real players.  It is insane the level of detail the developers have added to this mechanism.Map QualityThis game has one of the best graphical rendering systems i have ever used.  The maps are gorgeous and flaw free!  Each map was made to be a fully emmersed scenario where you and your squad will feel as if you are actually there.Enemy AIThe Enemy Ai is the only thing I have 1 issue with.  This issue is they are just way to realistic!  They seem to play as if they are real players and not AI!  They call out to eachother your position, they tactically flank and execute plays against you while you are trying to defuse the bombs!Overall! This game is a definite 10/10 and I would recommend it to everyone!Most realistic shooter I have ever played.			"

												It certainly wishes to present itself as an original product, except neither giving credit to nor showing the same level of effort put forth as its progenitors (RS6 and SWAT series). It even feels like a very bad Rainbow Six 3 mod. Perspective of the models is laughably skewed from weapon to weapon, animations feel borrowed from the aforementioned games with less understanding of how they're actually supposed to work, the touted features can be found in every 'tactical shooter' but are expected to somehow be innovative because there's no regenerating health and cinematic setpieces (lol?), and worse still, I'm sure the same guy who did the bedroom headset-recorded voiceovers in the gameplay videos is the same one doing all the voice acting in-game, and from the sound of it, with the same equipment.All in all, it's an embarrassingly unoriginal, pretentious and hamhanded vision of what I expect from a game that proudly displays a blurb from Polygon as a monument of its worth.

												Ok, important things first. If you were one of the people over the weekend from February 15 to the 16th looking for a cheap game to buy this was the cheapest that happend to be an FPS made in Unreal Engine 3. Now that I said that let me tell you about this game. It poorly represents an Unreal Engine game. This game was a dollar on sale for a reason. I always thought Meta Critic and general Steam gamers that do reviews are harsh on any game they play. Well Meta Critic and Steam players were right about this one. This game sucks donkey♥♥♥♥♥♥and it is poorly made. The walking speed in this game sucks too. So when you are ""running"" you go granny speed and when you hold the shift key you are supposed to be walking. Well my ♥♥♥♥ing turtle beats the characters pace on either running or walking mode. Guns are modeled horribly, AI sucks, not enough servers (who cares nobody plays this♥♥♥♥♥♥, and when I bought it on sale it gave me another free copy to send to a friend. This game FAILS and is a complete waste of my 0.2 hours playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Read everyones review how this game really blows the guy nextdoor for a cheap exchange in money for players.			"

												This game had such potential, yet it utterly failed to deliver. It's wrong to say this game is broken. Red Saber was never a game to begin with it was a scam. Much like alien colonial marines nothing we saw of this game was even close to the truth of the matter. Unlike Aliens months after release the game is still broken and unplayable at the best of time. Avoid like the plague.I would and should go into more depth, but in all honesty it would be an utter waste of time the game is broken and imposible to enjoy.			"

												About as much fun as a punch to the junk. Тhe enemy AI is stupid but still able to drop you with single magical bullet (sometime before you can even see them or them you). While this is going on, the rest your AI teammates are busy with coloring books somewhere else in the level because helping you doesn't seem that important.The best part is after you die from a magic bullet to your frontal lobe, you take control of one of your teammates who has managed to tare himself away from his coloring book long enough to let you relive the experience all over again.Dont buy/gift this game for anyone you like or would like to remain friends with.

												I downloaded this again after a huge patch promised to fix this game. It hasn't.It's still broken. It's still dumb. It's still infuriating. And you still can't even change video settings mid-game. Nope. Every U3 engine game has this basic, fundamental feature but not this game! Nope. Want to turn down some graphics (which you'll want to since this game is so badly optimized) then tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, because you'll have to end your game to do so. Not only that, but the graphics look ugly, both in terms of graphical fidelity and general art style that really show a real lack of flare or interest. Compare the locations here to classics such as SWAT 4 and it just doesn't compare at all,  and I have no problem at all with saying that SWAT 4 has better graphics than this. It does.The A.I. still flails wildly from jedi mind tricks to sheer, inane stupidity, with absolutely no happy middleground. Each map is either unbearably tough and unfinishable, or you steam roll opponents like they aren't even there.the guns are fine, they look like guns, I guess, so whatever. But honestly, how can you get gun models wrong in this day and age? That said, it's no Battlefield or CoD in terms of how nice they look really, so even in that area this title is just very generic.Being a massive SWAT 4 fan, I was super excited about this, but it's not even a patch on the classic. There's no hostages to speak of, your teammates are just cardboard cut outs to be mutilated by zen-like opponents, there's no atmosphere, no immersion factor, you never feel like a SWAT officer (or are these guys army guys? The game isn't even clear on that) Like a lot of people, I saw TotalBiscuits playthrough of this and was super excited. What I didn't realize is that playing the game for more than 30 minutes will tell you everything you need to know. This isn't the tactical shooter you're looking for. There's barely any room for tactical descision, as your thought process is usually ""will the A.I. headshot me from miles away in this next room or will they stand there looking at the walls?""Don't play this, play SWAT 4 instead. It's an eight year old game with more replay value, realism, fear, tension and tactical thought than anything this game has to offer.			"

This game was NO WHERE NEAR REMOTELY CLOSE TO PLAYABLE ON LAUNCH. It had more GAME-BREAKING BUGS than the dirt beneath your house. Because of this MONUMENTAL FAILURE many would-be dedicated and supportive players have all but abandoned the game completely. It needed probably 2 more YEARS of solid development prior to release. They do appear to SLOWLY be fixing things, and I haven't kept myself informed as to exactly why this happened (publisher?), so I won't even bother to blame the developer anyways.

												(Don't care about the playtime, played it on Xbox too.) I chose the level on picture number 8 from the left. Looks like a Hotel. You spawn to the left of the map in a corner. I spawned and went literally 3 steps and got shot. I barely went around a corner and got shot. The AI in this game is so horrible, it's almost believeable they just slapped a aimbot on to them. They will shoot you even if they aren't looking at you. The enemy can be running and looking away while somehow magicly their bullets will fly 180 degrees and headshot you. Their movement is like something you've never seen before. In the bad way.  Don't get fooled by the description they put.""This is a company that has made the decision to skip following the generic shooter genre, let's get rid of levels, noob tubing, and throw in tactics and strategy instead""There are no tactics or strategy in this. The enemy will gun you down from insane distances in a split second from spawn. I really had faith in this, looking at the videos and pictures (Forgot all about gameplay videos of course)2/10 The only fun i had in this game, was competing with my friends who could kill the most enemies before getting killed by their Aimbots.

Best we can hope for is for the devs to patch it and sort out the horrid AI and pants sounding guns (just to name a few problems).Anyway apart from it being 100% pure tripe I was hoping for redemption in some sort of online co-op mode to play with the lads (rainbow six-esque). But it seems the match making is broken, even when just hosting my match.  SOOOOOO until they patch it and sort out the online play I really do recommend you AVOID this game, especially now its £11.99 again!  Safe. "

												""Ah, how bad could it be?"" I thought to myself when i saw this game on sale. What i was about to blindly delve into could only be compared to performing a hysterectomy on someone you love and cherish like your mother, your cat or yourself even.I played this game twice. At first i quit because i really wanted to vomit everywhere, and the second time i was forced to quit because i vomited all over my brand new computer, which consequently broke beyond repairs. I also flooded half of my house with vomit, so i don't think i enjoyed this game a whole lot. There's actually no campaign at all, only a few guards with down's syndrome in a couple of maps that every now and then see you with the back of their head and sexually abuse you beyond repairs.Basically, if you are an avid bulimic or would like to move to a new house and buy a new computer, then get this game. It will work quickly and strongly like a very good laxative that poisons your very soul.P.S. If you do decide to get this game, make sure it's not on sale. Everyone who buys this game despite all the negative comments deserves every second of torturous pain they will receive (including myself)			"

												This game was a lot harder than I thought.  Basically it was like real life: you get shot, you die.  Guess thats why this is a hardcore fps.  However, what I didn't like was how the graphics were actaully pretty poor and that there is no multiplayer base at all.  When I was trying to find any sort of online co-op match, I found 3, 2 of which were friend only and 1 which had a ridiculously high ping.  The game is not very entertaining for the casual fps game that likes to run in and take shots and regen the health back after waiting a little as you literally die with 1 shot.  Regardless, this game would be for some people, but it is just not for me as I flat out don't like hardcore fps games where you die this fast.Rating: 4.5			"

												A friend recommended I get this to try with him, and it was on sale for only a dollar. We both love realistic shooters so I decided to give it a shot.Unfortunately, this game was not worth the money. The game just feels unfinished. It may have had promise but there are so many clunky things about it, namely the AI and interface. The combat is middling, but this game did one good thing for me: it made me harken back to a much better game, Raven Shield. Buy that instead.			"

												I REALLY wanted this to be the spiritual sequel to SWAT 4/Rainbow Six 3. Not only did it fall short of that wish, but it is just an overall bad game. If you ignore my, and countless others' dissatisfaction with this game, add anybody that has purchased the game. They gave everyone a second copy for free because so many customers complained.			"

The developers should be ashamed of themselves for ever having contributed to this lame, limp, lifeless and beyond half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt and a game. If ever there were a compelling argument for quality control through steams greenlight service, this game should be used as an example as to why it is so obviously needed.

												It seemed to be a much older game than what I am used to. It did have quite a bit of potential and probably would've taken off if all of these other first person shooters hadn't brainwashed us with a ""good"" and ""bad"" perspective on games. This one digs more into the serious aspect of a game, the one that makes you think, because your movement speed is slowed down significantly compared to other games, and one bullet is all it takes to kill you. Now, none of this is to say it is a bad game, I just don't have the taste for it, however, if you like a game that has rather indecent graphics, slow and difficult controls, a very limited armory with absolutely no possibility of hand to hand combat due to the lack of a melee command, and absolutely no storyloine or unlockable items; I'd recommend this game to you. If you do not, I'd suggest a different game for you, because there is a reason there's no gameplay in the trailer...			"

It isnt all that bad, the main mechanics are solid (I mean the ingame mechanics, not the menu, which is crap), although there are not much guns and I still don't know why there is C4 in the game. There is nothing to breach.Why I wouldn't recommend it:The difficulty is too high. Sometimes the enemies will hit nothing at all, sometimes you round the corner and you are dead immediatly. Extremly frustrating that is.My second point: Those 2 main points of criticism still aren't fixed. The developers don't seem to care.			"

												The main problem with Takedown: Red Sabre (and there are many) is that it offers nothing new to the genre it was trying to revitalise. Worse than that, it lacks many of the features one would expect from a ""tactical shooter"" (teammate commands, a map, a proper single player campaign etc).Add to that a multitude of bugs, barely functional multiplayer, amatuerish animation, poor UI and a general lack of content, and you have a rushed, unfinished game that is a step backwards from what we've seen in the past and really serves no purpose whatsoever.Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield does the same thing much better. It's on Steam right now for half the price of Takedown- it was released 10 years prior and offers much deeper tactical options, a worthwhile single player campaign, more maps, and more weapons. Why bother with Takedown?			"

												i found this game to be nothing more than a rainbow six clone that offers subpar graphics for a pc-based shooter. in fact, the graphics are reminicent of rainbow six 3. the weapons behave just like in rainbow, with a fire selector and attachment options only modifiable in menus and not in-game (why not have a toggle suppresor feature?) a +1 round capacity like in rainbow, and the reloads are very generic. the player moves very slow by default unless you hold down the shift or control key and there's two other buttons for leaning around corners ala rainbow six 3 (q and e for leaning left and right). the enemies manage to kill you in one shot, then you have 3 more squad mates to take over but with the ease of how enemies can kill you, your whole squad can be wiped out in a matter of seconds, so its nearly pointless to have a team. the weapon selection is also very bland and generic, mainly m4 variants and only a few other longer range m16 variants, the shotguns are limited in variety, and the pistols are just a couple M9 and 1911 variants. get a rainbow six game, that would easily outclass this game 100 times over and save your money from this			"

												I downloaded this again after a huge patch promised to fix this game. It hasn't.It's still broken. It's still dumb. It's still infuriating. And you still can't even change video settings mid-game. Nope. Every U3 engine game has this basic, fundamental feature but not this game! Nope. Want to turn down some graphics (which you'll want to since this game is so badly optimized) then tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, because you'll have to end your game to do so. Not only that, but the graphics look ugly, both in terms of graphical fidelity and general art style that really show a real lack of flare or interest. Compare the locations here to classics such as SWAT 4 and it just doesn't compare at all,  and I have no problem at all with saying that SWAT 4 has better graphics than this. It does.The A.I. still flails wildly from jedi mind tricks to sheer, inane stupidity, with absolutely no happy middleground. Each map is either unbearably tough and unfinishable, or you steam roll opponents like they aren't even there.the guns are fine, they look like guns, I guess, so whatever. But honestly, how can you get gun models wrong in this day and age? That said, it's no Battlefield or CoD in terms of how nice they look really, so even in that area this title is just very generic.Being a massive SWAT 4 fan, I was super excited about this, but it's not even a patch on the classic. There's no hostages to speak of, your teammates are just cardboard cut outs to be mutilated by zen-like opponents, there's no atmosphere, no immersion factor, you never feel like a SWAT officer (or are these guys army guys? The game isn't even clear on that) Like a lot of people, I saw TotalBiscuits playthrough of this and was super excited. What I didn't realize is that playing the game for more than 30 minutes will tell you everything you need to know. This isn't the tactical shooter you're looking for. There's barely any room for tactical descision, as your thought process is usually ""will the A.I. headshot me from miles away in this next room or will they stand there looking at the walls?""Don't play this, play SWAT 4 instead. It's an eight year old game with more replay value, realism, fear, tension and tactical thought than anything this game has to offer.			"

Perspective of the models is laughably skewed from weapon to weapon, animations feel borrowed from the aforementioned games with less understanding of how they're actually supposed to work, the touted features can be found in every 'tactical shooter' but are expected to somehow be innovative because there's no regenerating health and cinematic setpieces (lol?), and worse still, I'm sure the same guy who did the bedroom headset-recorded voiceovers in the gameplay videos is the same one doing all the voice acting in-game, and from the sound of it, with the same equipment.All in all, it's an embarrassingly unoriginal, pretentious and hamhanded vision of what I expect from a game that proudly displays a blurb from Polygon as a monument of its worth.

												Ok, important things first. If you were one of the people over the weekend from February 15 to the 16th looking for a cheap game to buy this was the cheapest that happend to be an FPS made in Unreal Engine 3. Now that I said that let me tell you about this game. It poorly represents an Unreal Engine game. This game was a dollar on sale for a reason. I always thought Meta Critic and general Steam gamers that do reviews are harsh on any game they play. Well Meta Critic and Steam players were right about this one. This game sucks donkey♥♥♥♥♥♥and it is poorly made. The walking speed in this game sucks too. So when you are ""running"" you go granny speed and when you hold the shift key you are supposed to be walking. Well my ♥♥♥♥ing turtle beats the characters pace on either running or walking mode. Guns are modeled horribly, AI sucks, not enough servers (who cares nobody plays this♥♥♥♥♥♥, and when I bought it on sale it gave me another free copy to send to a friend. This game FAILS and is a complete waste of my 0.2 hours playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Read everyones review how this game really blows the guy nextdoor for a cheap exchange in money for players.			"

												I thought to myself ""For .99 it can't be /that/ bad."" Well I assure you it can be. The AI in this game can hear you coming from half way across the map even if you are using silencers and moving at the slowest possible move speed. It's sad that a game can be released in this state and I feel for those who were fooled in to kickstarting this. AVOID AT ALL COSTS (even .99)!			"

												I met a lot of my friends in Raven Shield. We then progressed to other tactical games such as SWAT. With a lack of true tactical games where strategy is needed we had high hopes for this. We bought it, installed it, and played in for 30 minutes. It was promptly removed.Recently, we thought we'd give it another try since it has been a while. Maybe improvements were made and it was progressing more towards completion. Wrong.I do have to say that the player models are pretty good. That's the only thing good about this game. Sorry guys....I'm just...sorry. Is there a way to remove it from my Steam library?			"

												Horrible, unfinished, sloppy piece of crap game that obviously needs it's A.I fixed. The levels are good and missions are decent enough, but if you so much as open a door to outside Gary who graduated top of his class in A.I Academy will snap his pistol up and shoot you from the hip 2.7 miles away the moment your head breaks the plane of that door. That being said if you have 2-3 friends who are masochists this game is a blast trying to clear out missions together as the broken A.I makes this game challenging for an entirely different set of reasons the developer intended for. Accidently made a lobby in multiplayer and someone was actually on and joined in. I'm half certain it was the actual creator of the game cause I don't know anyone that hates themselves enough to play this game singleplayer.			"

												This game has some potential but suffers severly from a few issues, namely:a) AI that is, at the same time, beyond stupid and annoyingly precise in it's shooting. Bad guys go from not seeing you at all to sniping you with a slingshot from across the map. Oh, and they take out the entire rest of your idiot squadmates before you can even switch characters. Which leads me to...b) No squadmate commands. Horridly annoying with the AI as completely mentally handicapped as it is in this game. This means you can't even use your blind/deaf/can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥squadmates at scout fodder. It also makes any kind of tactics like what you might be used to in Raven Shield completely impossible.c) Horrid interface design. It's completely unintuitive and doesn't flow.d) Nagging Issues: Here's one -every single door on every map starts ""open"". Minor in the grand scheme of things but annoying combined with a and b above when a hostile snipes you through 5 bulkheads or doors that would otherwise be closed. It's worth mentioning because it demonstrates the complete lack of polish on this game, and this isn't the only example I could have picked.e) There are other numerous issues that individually aren't huge but combined make for a frustrating experience.f) The developer doesn't seem interested in addressing player concerns. For the longest time I remember every complaint was responded with ""Due to the hardcore nature of the game..."". It was used as an excuse for exceptional game-breaking bugs (like the aforementioned horrible AI). The map design, overall, I thought was decent even if it feels a bit sparse or dated. A few of them are good enough I'd love to play them in Raven Shield. Frankly though this game just isn't worth it, and the developer doesn't seem interested in fixing it. This game is simply incomplete. I haven't dumped a lot of time into it and I have zero desire to bother again. While it has the potential to be pretty awesome at the moment it offers nothing you can't get elseware.			"

												Don't! Just don't!I too wanted to like this game.. But didn't.Menu/lobbyOhhh Boy!The menues were the first alarm bell. Controls in the menues and lobby are clunky. Clearly aimed at the console crowd.There are no drop-down boxes for selection and overview of your options, and the menu graphics are.. well.. outdated is a nice way to put it.But to hell with menues if the game is good.But notice, there is no where to select enemy difficulty.. More on that below.Single-Player/AIAs already stated by others, the AI is...... well.. Frustrating is a nice way to put it.The enemies are super-human.. the AI squad mates, not so much.Example: AI squad mate crouches in the open and just looks at an enemy while I franticly try to shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and he me. Even after a reload, my 'friend' was still hesitant to shoot the terrorist.Another example: Sneaking down a corridor, a squad mate calls out, enemy spotted. I look left, I look right.. Nothing. No enemies. Then I hear the shot and the 'man down' message. Turns out, an enemy had moved up behind us. My squad mates spotted him as the proffesionals they are.. but.. decided he wasn't worth shooting at.Most of the time, though, the AI enemies will simply shoot you before you get a chance to spot them, so no worries.To put this in contrast, I enjoyed Rainbow Six 3. The AI was challenging, but the squad mates were dependable.Multi-playerSorry, I couldn't be bothered.Weapons, outfits and grenadesGrenades are weird: I threw a grenade at an enemy, but one of my AI squad mates walked in front of me and the grenade bounced back from his head.........Also tried throwing a grenade into a room where an enemy was waiting to ambush me. No explosion ensued, so apparently the grenade just vanished.The emphasis on realistic weapon modeling is a joke. The military trained me to fire a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor SMG at targets 100 yards away.. and hit. http://www.thm-online.dk/public/billeder/genstande/1500-1599/b_1524_s.jpg <--- The SMG in question.In contrast, the 'proffesional' soldiers portraied in this game can't hit a stationary enemy.. from a stationary crouch.. with a holographic sight.. at 30-40 yards.The enemy advanced, and at less than 10 yards, more like 5, I finally managed to score a hit.. Not by carefull aiming, as I had done up to this point, but by spraying an entire magazine at his center body mass.Also, forget anything about bigger weapons and more powerfull sighting systems in single player, as you will always be leading your team. I decided not to try multi-player, so I have no idea if they are actually usefull there.I only tried a few weapons, but I noticed that the Steyr SMG, which should be awesome at this stuff; I've fired the Steyr Assault Rifle, and it's magnificent... The Steyr SMG in this game is crap. Horrible accuracy and control.For some reason, all the weapons use silencers by default, but this is worthless, as the enemies apparently can hear silenced weapons through several concrete walls.Weapon recoil is hillarious. Muzzle travel is comparable to firing an LMG from a standing position. Nuff said.You got a selection of armor, but I found that only the heaviest armor was usefull. The restrictions on wearing the biggest armor is not really that big, but being able to survive a few hits from the OP AI enemies is worth everything.Movement and controlI appreciate the effort to limit player mobility. However, there is a fine line between limited mobility and useless mobility.You can sprint. You can walk.. and you can sneak. Fairly standard. However, even at less than 10 yards, you have little chance of hitting anything if you as much as sneak, let alone walk around. I found that there was no such thing as hitting anything while on the move. So move-stop-aim-shoot became standard.One good thing has been implemented. You can turn on your flashlight and use the light as an aiming cone. Much like the proffesionals do. This lets you hit things in close quarters without actually aiming through the sight.As a nod to other tactical shooters, you can lean to a side. The first-person view effect being that the screen tilts a bit and your view moves a hairline fracture to the side. However, you CANNOT move while leaning, so if you want to take the smart option at doors, you will learn a new, weird dance of getting in position, leaning.. looking at the doorframe still.. un-lean.. move.. lean.. still looking at the door frame.. unlean.. move.. Ohhh, the enemy in the room just shot you.This should have been an awesome mechanic, but I decided real early to just forget about it.And lastly, speaking of moving, while you have been limited by the devs to how fast and agile you can move, the enemies have no such problems. Often running or dashing through rooms, then stopping bone-snappingly fast and firing off one round that hits you straight in the face.The resultThis game has done one thing right.The devs have reminded me that, Counter-Strike wasn't that bad a game after all, and maybe I should download it again and play it a bit.I know I paid €1.24 for this game.. but I really want my money back, not to mention the hour or so I spend playing it.So don't.. Just don't..			"

												EDIT: Decided to reinstall after what.. a year? Still awful. Avoid like the plague, seriously.Takedown: Red Sabre is.. painful.It fails as a tactical shooter. Planning is non-existent, there's no map in the briefing and no ingame map. There are no squad commands past ""wait"" and ""follow"". Your AI companions are basically extra lives for when you inevitably die. Flashbangs either don't work, or they blind you through a wall. There are no smoke grenades, or thermal goggles, so you're extremely limited in your options. Firefights boil down to edging around a corner, crouched and aiming, hoping you see the other guy first. Hardcore? Maybe. Tactical? Not a chance.			"

												This game is pretty crappy.  The tutorial doesn't give you what keys you are supposed to use, which can be hard since they wont even let you access the menu besides resume and Menu, A.I. will stand for 3 maybe 4 seconds before they actually shoot you, and also there is no consequences for shooting your teammates in S.P.  Even though I got this for a few cards that I sometimes collect i'd say it was worth the 10 cards that I used to trade with.  Other than that this game is a pile of s***.  It's hilarious at first watching teammates stand while you shoot everything then it becomes annoying.  If I had to give this a rating out of ten, this would get a 2 since there is a bit of fun to be had.			"

												Okay, I've put in a fair amount of time to this game, -90% off? FPS Game that is tactical? Sure! Bought 7 copies for 5 dollars, and got it to work as soon as i put it in, okay. The loadout is personally my favorite aspect of this game, you get to make your own loadout, to fit your personal standards, cool. But the game, is, TERRIBLE, first off, when you play the training, its basic, you already know how to fit this game, the controls are standard, but serve no purpose. When you play your first mission, you will know what I'm talking about. The AI is too smart, smarter than your highly trained SWAT team you have following you like mindless zombies. When they see a bad-guy, they say Tango Spotted, so I tell them to shoot it, they just look at it though. The enemy AI always knows where you are. Your only intel is what the game gives you. You spend more time getting killed by super buffed pirates than you do killing pirates that aren't trained. If you're going stealthy, you'd expect that they wouldn't know where you are. But really, all they do is aim at you, until you come into the direct line of sight, then they start running after you. Glass is bad for you, because you can't entirely see through it, but the enemy can, and shoot at you, killing you on the first hit. There are around 2-3 people that are programmed to look in a certain direction, and not staring at you the entire time. Your team is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you cannot tell a single person what to do. You have a sniper, an assault, and a breach, you are supposed to be the recon, but what if you don't like that class? Your team will stare at a bad guy, but not fire. They do not know where a single person is, until the person shoots them in the head, with their 99.99% accuracy, while yours and your teammates accuracy is 80%. Your team is clunky, ending up alerting the enemy before you can scope out the map, because you cannot make them wear different armor, or armor fit for what you want to do. The mission always wants you to go steath, when the mission objectives call for action. Your team always has silencers, when you don't even need them. Now I'm getting started on multiplayer. Half the time, you're on the team with a prick, who only wants you to hate the game you payed for, it's not even free, so they kill you with their insta-kill guns, wearing huge♥♥♥♥♥armor, so they kill the entire team before the game even really starts, then they kill themselves, because they're bored. Other than that the maps are too big for 6 on 6 team deathmatches. If you could have 12 people on each team, then it would be fair, and the match would be 90% more interesting, but it's full of boring experience. I was lucky to buy the game for less than a dollar, you, are not. If you really want this game, just message me and I'll send you a copy. But be warned, until the makers seriously patch this game. IT'S NOT WORTH IT. 2/10			"

												Horrible, unfinished, sloppy piece of crap game that obviously needs it's A.I fixed. The levels are good and missions are decent enough, but if you so much as open a door to outside Gary who graduated top of his class in A.I Academy will snap his pistol up and shoot you from the hip 2.7 miles away the moment your head breaks the plane of that door. That being said if you have 2-3 friends who are masochists this game is a blast trying to clear out missions together as the broken A.I makes this game challenging for an entirely different set of reasons the developer intended for. Accidently made a lobby in multiplayer and someone was actually on and joined in. I'm half certain it was the actual creator of the game cause I don't know anyone that hates themselves enough to play this game singleplayer.			"

												EDIT: Decided to reinstall after what.. a year? Still awful. Avoid like the plague, seriously.Takedown: Red Sabre is.. painful.It fails as a tactical shooter. Planning is non-existent, there's no map in the briefing and no ingame map. There are no squad commands past ""wait"" and ""follow"". Your AI companions are basically extra lives for when you inevitably die. Flashbangs either don't work, or they blind you through a wall. There are no smoke grenades, or thermal goggles, so you're extremely limited in your options. Firefights boil down to edging around a corner, crouched and aiming, hoping you see the other guy first. Hardcore? Maybe. Tactical? Not a chance.			"

												This game is pretty crappy.  The tutorial doesn't give you what keys you are supposed to use, which can be hard since they wont even let you access the menu besides resume and Menu, A.I. will stand for 3 maybe 4 seconds before they actually shoot you, and also there is no consequences for shooting your teammates in S.P.  Even though I got this for a few cards that I sometimes collect i'd say it was worth the 10 cards that I used to trade with.  Other than that this game is a pile of s***.  It's hilarious at first watching teammates stand while you shoot everything then it becomes annoying.  If I had to give this a rating out of ten, this would get a 2 since there is a bit of fun to be had.			"

												I had such high hopes for this game and I think thats what hurts the most. I love tac shooters and the kickstarter campaign behind this game made believe that the time was right for a comeback. I bought this game on day one and needless to say I will never buy a game on day again. It's just really broken, rushed and like the opposite of fun. It's a real shame becuase there is a desire for this types of games and its sucks so much that these yahoos bungled this title so badly. Get door kickers and rainbow six 3 instead.			"

												New tactical shooter at a low price running on Unreal? Why is is so cheap?If I had to place a specific genre on the top of my list of games I want to play the most, it would have to be the ""Sci-Fi Tatical Shooter"" genre. While Stellar Marines isn't anywhere close to complete, I looked for something to challenge me in the mean time.At the end of the day, playing isn't good enough. There has to be a challenge, and that is what seems to separate the two major classes of modern gamers. Games used to make you rage to the point of throwing your machine out the window (and not due to bugs!). Takedown: Red Sabre returns to these roots for the most part, which is why it was hyped up at the start.So what about all the other reviews and metascore? Why are they giving the title a huge thumbs down? Well the key issue lays with release day. I had thought about purchasing the title on release day, but passed off wanting to ensure I wasn't wasting money on a buggy game. Good thing I did, bugs were everywhere in the game. People would disconnect from singleplayer games randomly, and the server browser didn't work. Rest assured most (if not all) release day bugs have been fixed.Being a ""hardcore"" tactical shooter, it's not easy to beat. Playing by yourself is quite a trick, so bring friends whenever possible.Speaking of friends -- to make the game enjoyable you should bring some. The game isn't VAC secured, and trolls will be in game sooner or later. Teamkilling seems to consist of a moral punishment, nothing more. There's no current system (2/10/2014) to get rid of them without knowing Unreal's console. An oversight for sure, mainly from the game being so cheap. And don't forget there's no private or password protected lobbies!The game isn't complete, and shouldn't be advertised as such. The AI is very hit-or-miss, having naturally deadly aim the moment you open the door, but then stare at you in other cases. Flashbangs don't interact how they should, as AI don't seem to be ""flashed"" when thrown. The AI also seem to be unaware of any sounds, but then can somehow know you are outside the door.Maps are well designed, modeled after real life places that a tactical team might find themselves in. The key part is that the levels don't lack in openness. You have to be naked out in the open sometime, proving to be an almost instant death if you don't play it right. Indoor environments react how they should, but door handling with latency can be an issue.Could the game be more? For sure and without a doubt. Examples would be finer tuning on the Kevlar or bullet resistant gear (like where on the body), a prone position, or even a true clip/magazine system (a big must for hardcore). However, the title has to clean up the AI. In it's current state, it's not really hardcore, but it's getting there. One way to clean the AI up would be to add group intelligence like that seen in Half Life 2. Squad tactics are shown on the human side of Takedown, but not on the AI side of things. It would be simple as adding code when an AI spots a human player, other AI join in the firefight. Just play the level called ""Facility"" on Co-op. You will see what I mean, the AI all act independently.So there you have it. All the issues but good positives as well. This review is kind of odd being price dependent. I purchased the title for about $1.79. At that cost, I would happily slap a 7 for title. At it's regular cost, 6.5.

												New tactical shooter at a low price running on Unreal? Why is is so cheap?If I had to place a specific genre on the top of my list of games I want to play the most, it would have to be the ""Sci-Fi Tatical Shooter"" genre. While Stellar Marines isn't anywhere close to complete, I looked for something to challenge me in the mean time.At the end of the day, playing isn't good enough. There has to be a challenge, and that is what seems to separate the two major classes of modern gamers. Games used to make you rage to the point of throwing your machine out the window (and not due to bugs!). Takedown: Red Sabre returns to these roots for the most part, which is why it was hyped up at the start.So what about all the other reviews and metascore? Why are they giving the title a huge thumbs down? Well the key issue lays with release day. I had thought about purchasing the title on release day, but passed off wanting to ensure I wasn't wasting money on a buggy game. Good thing I did, bugs were everywhere in the game. People would disconnect from singleplayer games randomly, and the server browser didn't work. Rest assured most (if not all) release day bugs have been fixed.Being a ""hardcore"" tactical shooter, it's not easy to beat. Playing by yourself is quite a trick, so bring friends whenever possible.Speaking of friends -- to make the game enjoyable you should bring some. The game isn't VAC secured, and trolls will be in game sooner or later. Teamkilling seems to consist of a moral punishment, nothing more. There's no current system (2/10/2014) to get rid of them without knowing Unreal's console. An oversight for sure, mainly from the game being so cheap. And don't forget there's no private or password protected lobbies!The game isn't complete, and shouldn't be advertised as such. The AI is very hit-or-miss, having naturally deadly aim the moment you open the door, but then stare at you in other cases. Flashbangs don't interact how they should, as AI don't seem to be ""flashed"" when thrown. The AI also seem to be unaware of any sounds, but then can somehow know you are outside the door.Maps are well designed, modeled after real life places that a tactical team might find themselves in. The key part is that the levels don't lack in openness. You have to be naked out in the open sometime, proving to be an almost instant death if you don't play it right. Indoor environments react how they should, but door handling with latency can be an issue.Could the game be more? For sure and without a doubt. Examples would be finer tuning on the Kevlar or bullet resistant gear (like where on the body), a prone position, or even a true clip/magazine system (a big must for hardcore). However, the title has to clean up the AI. In it's current state, it's not really hardcore, but it's getting there. One way to clean the AI up would be to add group intelligence like that seen in Half Life 2. Squad tactics are shown on the human side of Takedown, but not on the AI side of things. It would be simple as adding code when an AI spots a human player, other AI join in the firefight. Just play the level called ""Facility"" on Co-op. You will see what I mean, the AI all act independently.So there you have it. All the issues but good positives as well. This review is kind of odd being price dependent. I purchased the title for about $1.79. At that cost, I would happily slap a 7 for title. At it's regular cost, 6.5. With the odd handling somehow working out to make a hard game, it certainly checks the ""different"" checkbox for me. Anyone that knows me well enough understands it's a key criteria to meet.6.5/10 - 7/10			"

												If you're a standard FPS (First Person Shooter) Gamer like me ""that enjoys playing shooters like Battlefield, Medal of Honor, Call of Duty ect."" Then seriously don't buy this game. This game is more of a Military simulator like the ARMA series. If you're the person that likes to run and gun this isn't your game (its more of a tactical strategy game) which I completely love usually. But in this case, when you're playing games like SWAT 4 ect.			"

They will understand and apologize. Being a gentleman/woman, you should accept their apology.This still gave me AIDS, there's really no charm to it: Bland visuals that look scarcely better than a GoldSRC mod, stiff controls, lame sound effects, stiff animations, horrible AI, and multiplayer rivaled by the thought of playing airsoft with teenagers.I would rather let a dysentery afflicted village use my hand as a communal toilet than play this again			"

												This game suffers from so many issues it is unreal, it is loosely based on the SWAT series although in this the AI are SO F******G over powered it is unreal. If you want to get steam cards then get this game as it gives you 1 card for each map you play but otherwise it isnt worth it, Just stick to CS:GO or cod or whatever. Do not invest in this game. Although i would say the one good thing is the gun models, they are very detailed but the recoil has spaz attacks. Haha			"

Posted: September 14, 2014
												This has got to be the best and most realistic shooter I have ever played PERIOD.  11 out of 7.  6 stars.  3 Thumbs up.This game is not for casual scrubby COD players, this is for the more serious skilled players, no not players, shooters.  You will actually feel like you are a real member of a special tatics team.  You get to play by yourself, or with up to three other team mates, either other human players or AI who actually act as though they were really special ops not just random 9 year olds spraying down hallways.  So if you can manage to get three serious people together you can have a great time simulating a real special ops team or team in general.  The game is really well designed and also, I'm pretty sure I mentioned this already, it's also really realistic.  You can create up to four different classes or presets with different gear.  You can also pretty much customize anything you could ever want!  You can pick your primary weapon and a secondary.  Your primary will pretty much be any weapon you could ever want.  You got rifles, single shot, burst fire, AND fully automatic, you got shotguns, you got it all, but no silly rocketlaunchers or grenade launchers as those would be both unneccesary and unrealistic for the missions you would be taking part of.  Your secondary will usually be some sort of pistol or a light weapon.  On top of choosing your own weapons, you can also pick attachments like different ironsights/scopes, and if that wasn't enough, you can also select different ammo (yes it matters), so be sure to have the right ammo for the right mission.  Then you get different equipment you can bring, I'm not going to bother listing them all but you can choose from a large assortment of grenades, you got claymores, you got all tons of stuff it's like a terrorist's dream come true.  I almost forgot to mention this, but you can also pick different armour or protective equipment that actually effect your gameplay, like it will make it so you can't run as fast or for a long amount of time if you have heavier equipment.  On top of that, you can even put a nice little patch representing whatever country you want on your sleeve.Now when you got your presets set up, you can pick either Singleplayer or Multiplayer to try them out.  I don't really want to take up too much of your time talking about the amazing thing called multiplayer, so in this review I'm only going to talk about single player.  First of all you get to choose which type of mission you want to do, from tango hunt to bomb disarment.  You'll get your mission briefing at the start of the mission and you can pick an area for deployment.  After that it's the same deal as most of those ""army"" or ""special forces"" shooters (cod, moh, etc.), where you'll go through the mission, but it's not like them at all.  You don't have that ridiculous red border to show that you're dying, you'll actually feel like you're dying and then eventually if you don't start to get serious, you'll be dead.  You also won't be picking up any of those silly health packs or other  nonsense pick ups.  The only things you'll be picking up are guns from the people you kill.  The enemy AI is also not like other typical games, where they just always miss and are totally oblivious of your presence.  They will hear your gunshots, they will hear your footsteps, they will call for backup.  Unless you get with the program you will die.  I'm not going to ruin the suprise of what happens when you manage to beat a level, that's an experience you just have to experience yourself.Well this review for this great game was a bit longer than I inteded it to be so I'll stop soon.  I'm going to start capitalizing every letter now to put emphasis on my next sentences.  THIS GAME IS A MUST BUY GAME, IT IS PRETTY MUCH A STEAL TOO.  IT'S SOO CHEAP I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE DOESN'T OWN THIS MASTERPIECE.  THIS GAME HAS IT ALL, GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, RADIOS.  I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I COULD ASK FOR IN A GAME.  THIS IS THE MOST REALISTIC SHOOTING EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING IN DANGER.  I CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH, THIS IS A  MUST BUY GAME !!!I'm pretty sure I forgot to mention some things, but I hope you get my point.			"

												Many people were thrilled when they heard they'd be getting a tactical shooter again in this day and age of action shooters like COD. The premise of tactical team-based combat ala SWAT and Rainbow Six is mouthwatering to any veteran team-player. With one of the key designers of the classic Rainbow Six games behind the helm it almost seemed too good to be true and unfortunately, it kind of is. First off i'll state the games has MUCH promise and the prospect of user generated content is fantastic, but the problem with Takedown is it lacks character and style its predecessors had. It feels very generic and lifeless plus the addition of serious network hiccups and server browser issues dosent help. If you played ""Realistic Shooters"" like Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising, SWAT 4, or ANY of the 3 Rainbow Six games, you'll learn this game pales in comparison to those. It has a budget price but for that same price you can buy one of the games i just mentioned and they would be more worth the buck. All in all, the initial feeling for this game is disappointment, but only time will tell if the devs can somehow redeem these critical mistakes.			"

												Got this game for free from the forums. Someone bought a four pack for some friends but they all denied the gift. Said I might as well add it to my collection of games I would personally never play. But then I wanted to get first hand on what everyone hated about it, So I hopped on bourd the shi* train to shi*ville and had a very short ride there. Right when I opened the game it I was in an avalanch of loud music and badly made intro sequencing that for the life of me could not skip, to get to the poorly made homescreen. I then went first to the training sequences to get a feel of the game. Trust me when I say this. There was no ""Feel"" Besides me bashing my head on the keyboard as I had to listen to the voice instructor and be frozen still for a good 20 minuets as he explained how to pis* in a can. I then got board and just got online. Seeing that only one server was active I joined and from my surprise. They were all 10 year old kids talking about eachothers mothers, I then tried playing the game. As I entered a room to get demolished by a guy facing the other direction as he shot at the wall. I then left the game. Deleted my :System32: File and said screw it to the world of videogames. Since then I have gotten married wrote a novel and even finished lawschool and now I am going to be a sucessful man in the name of the law. Overall long review short this game is the best thing thats ever happened to me and the time I played of it will be the best memories of my gaming career I once withheld. Thanks 505 Games!			"

												When I first loaded up Takedown: Red Sabre I was at a loss for words. The game portrays realistic close quarter combat in ways never seen before. The sheer atmosphere of the game quite literally took my breath away, because it made me want to die.The game is broken in so many ways, that you find yourself trying to change your loadout to one of the four predefined setups, only to find yourself always playing with the same weapon.The AI will either be intent on looking at the same wall until they are inevitably killed, or they will pull a blindfolded 720 noscope as soon as they see an atom on your body.Suffice to say, the game is broken to the level where it becomes a joke to play, but that in itself results in a tonne of fun. For all it's flaws, I've never had as many laughs playing a supposedly ""serious"" game as I have playing Takedown: Red Sabre.			"

No really, it's pretty solid now. It's fairly stripped down. No tactical map or plot, just creep about and shoot. However, it's a dead game at this point. No one plays it online, there's no community, and any future support is doubtful at best. It's a case of alienating an over-hyped audience with a truely terrible launch.			"

I went multiplayer and it was full of teamkillers and felt slow and unbalanced.Since it's still in development I hope it will get updated and we'll see a good game one day but right now it's not.

												I think I remember seeing this on kickstarter or something. Trying to revive the tactical shooter genre, comparing Takedown to classics like Rainbow Six and SWAT. This game doesn't even come close, though. I am so badly disappointed, I wish steam offered refunds, just so I could get my dollar back. It was on sale 80% off, $0.99, so I figured why not.The devs won't shut up about how tactical you have to be. How thoroughly you need to plan, how prepared you need to be, blah blah blah.The only ""tactics"" in this game seem to be:Peek around corners and shoot bad guys before they shoot you.Try to be sneaky and quiet.Fail at being sneaky and quiet because the bad guys apparently have the best hearing in the world, no matter how silent you think you're being.SWAT 4 was amazing. It came out in 2005, and it has more features and better gameplay than this pile of disappointment.It's pretty sad when a decade-old game is superior in every way.			"

My friend and I are huge PAYDAY 2 fans and we thought that this game would be similar to that. With the $1.50 price tag, it was almost an instant sell for us.SO MUCH DISAPPOINTMENT. Almost everything about this game is terrible. The graphics are mediocre at best, the controls are very uncomfortable, the AI is terrible, etc, etc, etc. It's almost like the developers put more time, effort, and money into the trailer than into the actual game.

												I bought this game when it was 1 dollar and got so far around 2 hours of playing time on it. That's well worth 1 dollar in my opinion. But 5 dollars? Not so much.Now, if you are looking at it for the full price, which is 5 dollars, you should take your money elsewhere. This game was kickstarted and I was looking forward to an actual tactical shooter as everyone else was. The team behind this game were a good set of developers who everyone believed could make a really good tactical shooter that could compare to games like SWAT 4 or the old Rainbow Six games.What you get instead is a game that seems about 80% finished, with solid shooting mechanics but shoddy texture work and poor AI. The AI sometimes hear you through two walls but sometimes don't notice you when you are next to them. Doesn't make any sense. The online community for this game doesn't exist as everyone has jumped ship on this game. So you're stuck with the AI teammates who just get killed constantly.For a dollar, if you are interested in a tactical shooter that you'll probably play for a couple of hours, go for it. But if you are looking for a tactical shooter for 5 dollars, look elsewhere. You're just wasting your money here.			"

												Terrible game, followed this as it was being made and had very high hopes that we would see a great tactical shooter following on from the original rainbow six games. Really all they needed to do was remake R6 Raven shield and the game would have worked. As it is it seems the developers have stopped working on the game and it is a truly horrible game to play. Payed 99p for it, and its not even worth that. What a shame...			"

												I usually don't write reviews for games, especially if they're bad, but boy... Thankfully I got 2 copies for $1.50, so it's not that big of a loss. It provided me with a lot of laughs at just how bad this game is. It's like if Rainbow Six and Counter Strike were to have a child, this would be it. But the child would have such bad mental retardation that it would basically be a vegetable. To pu that into applicable terms, it has the ""tactical"" ""gameplay"" of Rainbow Six with the ""style"" of Counter Strike. They might have managed to emulate a visual style close to Counter Strike, but oh boy, they missed all of the functionality. How about the tactial gameplay of Rainbow Six? Nope. AI is too stupid when you're not shooting, and way too smart when you are. They run out into the open, or run away from you. Basically, this video sums it up just perfectly:

 Stay the hell away, I don't care how cheap it is, unless you want to just laugh at how bad it is. I guess for $1.50 that's okay. 10 minutes was plenty to see how horrible this game was and that I never want to play it again. Is there a way to delete a game from your Steam library...?			"

												Well. I hate to make this my first review, but I don't feel like looking at my Child Health, Safety, & Nutrition coursework for the week. Here we go.So, the good news: guns, bullets, and the overall concept.The bad news: how all those come together.I won't be the first or last to state that the AI is just awful. As mentioned in another review, the enemy soldiers can pick you off from across the map with one quick and silent shot through your cover, faster than you can say: ""I wonder if people still play Ghost Recon?"" Sometimes all of them converge on the player at one single time, and if it wasn't bad enough that one has an advantage over you (that's right, I said <<advantage>> because they're Aimbots), you'll have no hope against multiple foes because... the controls are pretty stiff. Very stiff. Fiddle and configure all you want. Go ahead, stick that 360 control in. It does not matter. Now, some of us are not surprised by a more confined feeling for a game like this... except, here, the controls wear a straight jacket. There's not much that's smooth about them. At all, really.Now, as others have also said, I really wanted to like this game. Truly. In its current state, it is <<not>> a finished game. It's not. It's ugly.Wait - speaking of ugly - have you seen the graphics on it? Now, okay, I get it, graphics are not the end-all. But it wouldn't hurt to have worked on the aesthetics as long as the gameplay, tactics, realism, and controls were all being ignored.Verdict: In its current state, this game is not worth playing or owning. If they do a gargantuan overhaul and addres all the issues we see... maybe we'll talk.'til then, dudes, turn this baby down.PS: Sorry, Mike, I gifted this to you so it wouldn't be in my ""inventory.""

												Rainbow Six with ramped up difficulty and realistic gameplay. The game is so hard that the player is pushed into a position where they have to use their tactical prowess to survive. Guns basically insta-kill and there are pretty much no revives. The game, in its complete form, is an utter disaster. The maps are way too linear for tactical gameplay. I kept walking down stairs or into a room with a guy, and it would be who shot first rather than what strategy I used. The map design just doesn't help this mess, and that's only the beginning. Rainbow Six and other tactical shooters are fun because they don't sacrifice gameplay for realism. In Red Sabre, you can't get revived, and you don't respawn. If you die, you lose, and you are taken back to the lobby. In Hotline miami, you die a lot, but you respawn quickly and get as many chances as you want to complete the level. The same thing goes for Super Meat Boy. The truth is, Red Sabre needs a reason to be worth playing. The graphics are bland, the maps are linear and unexciting to say the least, and I don't feel compelled to completely restart the mission each time I fail at it. The developers clearly wanted a realistic feel, so that the players would be forced to play tactically. They did almost everything wrong with this game, and it isn't even close to being redeemed. The truth is, there are way better games on the market that do what this game does, but better. Honestly, I feel like this game tries to be unique among other shooters, but goes way over the top, and sacrifices any little bit of fun this game could've been capable of.			"

I mean, it was a great concept that I was really looking forward to, but the execution was just terrible.When jumping into the game you will likely be terribly confused, not really knowing where you're supposed to be going or how you're supposed to do things. Once you figure out exactly what you're doing, you realize that the matchmaking is horrible and to be honest, no one is really playing it. There's very few servers and most of them are filled with trolls that just teamkill everyone at the start.A horrible experience and the only thing that really made it worth it to me was that I ordered a 4-pack for friends and got 8 copies thanks to Steam messing up so I can troll-gift it to people, haha.

												This was supposed to be the great hero that would bring back hardcore tactical co-op first person shooting to the old farts like myself, who have been waiting for a successor to games like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 and SWAT 4. It held great promise and the developer spoke such sweet words, pouring honey on the ears of the people like me. Then it was released...At first it seemed like a game with some launch hick-ups and bugs. The basis was there for T:RS to take this not-so-well sought after throne, but every update was just making more and more of a mess. Then, not very long after release, they started to sell it for 1€ and gave all owners an extra copy to give away to unsuspecting enemies friends... which is kind of a clear sign that they threw in the towel and gave up on it.As said; the basic foundation is there; a hardcore, slow paced, co-op, tactical game... if you can get into it. It's hard enough to get a group to successfully join a server, but then you can't make that server private. The AI seems okay at first, but is actually bugged out like crap in a thunderstorm. The game freezes, the game rolls over like a dog without anyone commanding, the game just doesn't do what it's suppose to and does everything it's not suppose to. The only thing that worked from the get go; the in-game text-to-speech chat, they had removed in an update. First the maps were all too big, so you were running around searching for the last terrorist... then they made them smaller, but made them minimal.Nothing has gone right with Takedown: Red Sabre, and my kind (the hardcore co-op FPS:ers) had to look elsewhere. Fortunately we found Insurgency, which is a bloody good game; get that one instead!The only thing T:RS managed to do was to have our gaming group make sarcastic jokes about ""...it's in the hardcore nature of the game."" and ""...this game is epic!"" which were compliments once upon a time, but after the release and subsequent downfall of T:RS have now become the worst insults we can say about a game.It's all just really sad...

This game doesn't even come close, though. I am so badly disappointed, I wish steam offered refunds, just so I could get my dollar back. It was on sale 80% off, $0.99, so I figured why not.The devs won't shut up about how tactical you have to be. How thoroughly you need to plan, how prepared you need to be, blah blah blah.The only ""tactics"" in this game seem to be:Peek around corners and shoot bad guys before they shoot you.Try to be sneaky and quiet.Fail at being sneaky and quiet because the bad guys apparently have the best hearing in the world, no matter how silent you think you're being.SWAT 4 was amazing. It came out in 2005, and it has more features and better gameplay than this pile of disappointment.It's pretty sad when a decade-old game is superior in every way.			"

												This game is a ripoff. I believe Steam owes it to its customers to refund payment for this. It is not a tactical shooter it isn't anything really. Its junk its garbage masquerading as a game. Its a disgrace and Steam should bear some responsibility for putting such a lemon on its marketplace. This isn't a matter of taste either. This is now a known fact, check around. Don't buy. Whatever you do don't buy. Its like they published this knowing some people would buy just from reading they synopsis (I did) and not actually doing any research and thus didn't even try and just figured they would make what they could off of they synopsis alone and just made the lowest common denominator that could pass as a game without being legally liable. Which I am not sure they aren't because this game is of such poor quality and build, and so much lower than what one would expect I feel it is in some way a breach of contract.			"

When you play in single player or any of the gamemodes that involve the ai they will almost always shoot and kill you within 5 seconds of them seeing you.

												I went into this game with  an open mind and hoped with patches it would be good. Turns out, i should have just not gotten it. Quick note: I think it is worth $1.50 while its on sale, but its not worth $15 and that what i am basing my review on.Cons:-You would think by now the patches would be ironed out, but no. There is lag (i can run bf4) even in single player and there is constant stuterring. I can even occasionally shoot trough the edge of walls-The accuracy is awful for all guns except snipers and pistols. I understand that there is bullet drop and wind resistance, but i would take two shots in a row and sometimes, one bullet would go to the right while the other goes to the left. Makes no sense-Missions objectives are in the pause menu but you have no idea where your actually supposed to go. Concidering this is a simulator, you would think maybe you would have a blueprint. In one mission, a company hires you to go into their building to do some stuff, but does not give you a blueprint to locate the stuff. Do they want you to die?-when you are in lean mode and move, the game stutters -your weapon disappears when you touch a wall. I know this is on purpose but have no idea why. It is not part of a cover system and makes it easier to die when you try to hide behind a table only to learn you cant shoot.-squad system is not good at allPros:-okay, the game is not all bad. The the one-two hit kill is a nice feature for those looking for hard core games.-no respawn. True to the genre ""simulator"", once you die, your finished. If you are playing singleplayer, you can take the life of an ai teammate, but you only have three, and they can die on their own.-because you can die easily and lose 50 min of progress, it create a ""one more game"" feel as you are determined to beat that levelI will update as i play more.

												I came in thinking it was a more hardcore version of counterstrike, only to be baffled by the mission setup. I redid the first mission about 5 times before realizing that I had already completed it, but it  just doesn't tell you. Then I went on to the first mission thinking that it was a little mistake, before realizing that the AI are so overpowered they can hear you sneaking through the walls. Even your peaking ability doesn't help, as it only allows a small vision of the area, not so far that you could actually see them like it was desined to. I didn't even care to play the other missions fully as this one really just demoralized, depressed, and unsatissfied me in everyway possible for a game like this. So unless you want to waste your money, I personally do not recommend this game.			"

												This game has a clunky set of controls. The fact that the lean feature doesn't work when moving and combine that with the fact that you barely lean makes CQB next to impossible which the game is primarily based around. The friendly AI is always too close to you, which is strange since they are highly trained special forces soldiers or somthing, too make matters worse when you die and switch to one of the AI soldiers he's usally too close to where you got killed and the completely over powered enemy AI kills you as soon as you switch over to the next character. This game could have been a lot better if they had of held off releasing the game until much much later so they could fix the bugs properly and just improve the game in general.I hope one day the game get better so that I can recomend this game but that seems like it isn't going to be any time soon.

												Having played this after buying it for 79p (around $1/50 rublei) I can honestly say that I do not recommend this game to anyone. Ever. Even if it's free. There are several issues with the game and I am going to post a few:1. Lag. Everyone gets lag. It's terrible. However funny it is watching your team walk into walls it gets boring after a while.2. AI. The bots in this game are terrible. Team mates don't help you and enemies instantly kill you while they are facing into a wall.3. Shooting. You cannot kill anyone. Insane recoil and no weapon damage as well as inability to aim.4. Snails. You move like a snail.5. Feel. The menus are horrible. They don't work. You cannot change loadout for some reason. You cannot change settings during a game and they are very limited. The chat is horrible and messages disappear after 3 seconds. I am yet to find voice chat.6. Players. Barely anyone plays this and those who do hate it. End of.			"

From all the kickstarter support, you would have thought that these guys would have made a better game in every sense of the word. Through their marketing online, they made it seem that this game would be like a more realistic Rainbow Six: Vegas, which was one of my favorite shooters of the past decade. When I finally installed the game I could not belive my eyes. The game was truly terrible. Im wondering if all the money they raised for the kickstarter was used on rendering highly processed screenshots to show us. The game looks and plays nothing like what they showed on the kickstarter and is full of bugs and glitches. Dont waste your money or if this game winds up being free, dont waste your time.

												This game reminds me of playing Far Cry 3 on the hardest difficulty: Be spotted and you're as good as dead. While the AI seem to be unable to notice bullets from a far distance, they react quickly enough if they see you and don't always instagib you, for example, if you are peeking around walls. The wall-peek system, while a good concept, is executed in such a way that you end up having to slowly peek around all of the walls, in order to shoot the guy waiting around the corner before he can see you. This game might be good multiplayer, but the single-player experience feels like trying to use a cheese grater to kill a SWAT team. It's possible, but it mostly relies on luck and the enemies messing up.			"

												Do not buy this game. This is one of those games that metacritic will give a 32 for a good reason. The people who developed Take Down: Red Sabre probably had a good idea in mind, but executed it horribly. Take Down tries to bring realistic shooters to the modern day scene full of CoD and BF, but falls flat in a wide variety of aspects. First off, the gunplay is some of the worst I have had in a while. It consists of a poorly model weapon of choice with what seems like no recoil, but the spread on these guns is absolutely ridiculous after the first round. Second off, the AI is down right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, including your enemies and squad mates. It seems that there is only two different poles to this AI, they will either be A) Seal Team Six grade soldiers or B) third graders that had their heads smashed in with hammers. The enemies also have something similar happening, they will either kill you instantly with one shot, no chance to kill them, or miss every single god damn round in thier mag. The AI enemies also have ""unfair"" tactics sometimes, most often involving them clipping through the ♥♥♥♥ing wall and blasting you and the remaining members of your squad striaght out of the game. The map design is also rather subpar in comparison to most games these days, consisting of almost exclusively CQC oriented environments, and mass enemy spawning. The worst part about all of this is that this is a game coming out in 2013 and very well could've been the spiritual successor to Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six series, but takes that oppportunity and runs it into a 747 jet.

I saw that this was reviewed as being ""innovative."" Then, I guess, if I flunked out of college, I could've told everybody how innovative I was.For those reviews that state not to believe the negative reviews: I hope the developer gives you a copy of his next game for being such a fan.

												I didn't believe everyone's statements about how horrid, broken, and laughably poor this game was.Some even went as far as to say that for $1.50 US, it was far too high a price for the quality of the game.Well, some of that may be hyperbole, but the game certainly is fairly poor. It looks like there was a good vision behind it, but the execution of the vision was horrid on nearly every front.The engine has bugs galore (dropping to 1fps when I pressed F to reload? Sure, why not), the AI alternates between laser accuracy and Mister Magoo mode, your teammates have the intelligence of a warm cucumber, and the weapons all feel largely the same.Seriously, skip this game. It is as bad as they say, perhaps worse. However, if you're like me and can't resist trying a game to see if it really deserves the flak (as some certainly do not), give it a go.			"

												The game is very clunky and I feel like I have to fight the controles every step of the way, it is not smooth what so ever. The game I understand is supposed to be about strategy, tactics and key timing but your default speed in my opinion is a little too slow. I also had a lot of trouble with spawn points and it just seemed like no mater what type of armor you wore you die just as quick. I'm glade I didn't have to pay for this game because it clearly needs a lot of work done and unfortunately because it seemes like they rushed to put the game out I don't think this game is going to recover anytime soon with such bad reviews and poor gameplay. They talked big game but in the end this game just didn't deliver. I give it a 3/10 just because it has the right idea, the pieces were all there but they haven't figured how to put them together just yet.			"

												At first, I thought this looked like a wonderful game. The earliest demo videos showed promising gameplay of what could be a spiritual sequel to SWAT 4. But, after buying the game and playing it on launch day, it was absolutely atrocious. Nothing has been fixed since day 1, in fact, multiplayer is even further broken in my experience with a frustrating hour attempting to figure it out. Coming back to this game almost a year after release, with it in a worse state than on launch day, is just a joke. I wouldn't recommend this to even the biggest of tactical shooter fans.			"

This is a big waste of money if you buy it when it is $15 if you going to buy a shoot for that price buy insurgency. Cancer			"

												I went into this game with  an open mind and hoped with patches it would be good. Turns out, i should have just not gotten it. Quick note: I think it is worth $1.50 while its on sale, but its not worth $15 and that what i am basing my review on.Cons:-You would think by now the patches would be ironed out, but no. There is lag (i can run bf4) even in single player and there is constant stuterring. I can even occasionally shoot trough the edge of walls-The accuracy is awful for all guns except snipers and pistols. I understand that there is bullet drop and wind resistance, but i would take two shots in a row and sometimes, one bullet would go to the right while the other goes to the left. Makes no sense-Missions objectives are in the pause menu but you have no idea where your actually supposed to go. Concidering this is a simulator, you would think maybe you would have a blueprint. In one mission, a company hires you to go into their building to do some stuff, but does not give you a blueprint to locate the stuff. Do they want you to die?-when you are in lean mode and move, the game stutters -your weapon disappears when you touch a wall. I know this is on purpose but have no idea why. It is not part of a cover system and makes it easier to die when you try to hide behind a table only to learn you cant shoot.-squad system is not good at allPros:-okay, the game is not all bad. The the one-two hit kill is a nice feature for those looking for hard core games.-no respawn. True to the genre ""simulator"", once you die, your finished. If you are playing singleplayer, you can take the life of an ai teammate, but you only have three, and they can die on their own.-because you can die easily and lose 50 min of progress, it create a ""one more game"" feel as you are determined to beat that levelI will update as i play more.

												My experience in this game so far: Pros:+ Tries to be like Rainbow Six+ Looks like an older generation Rainbow Six Game (Nostalgia?)Cons:- Looks like an older generation Rainbow Six Game- Enemy AI isn't really smart, but shoots fast and pretty acurate- Multiplayer lacks options like password protection, friends only, friendly fire off, kicking in game, banning in game, muting in gameMy experience for the multiplayer so far: I gave a friend of mine a Key, so we could play a bit of the co-op. The first round went well enough - only that I started to hear a russian kid talking to his family. (Probably should have done his dishes, but failed to do so - I really couldn't understand) The next round, said russian kid starts to shoot us (Teammates) in the head - procedes to talk gibberish. Probably insulted our upbringing, or our parents. Maybe he asked us, if we could do his dishes. I really couldn't understand.I tried to kick him, or remove him from the game - put to no avail. We restarted the server. Now more than just that russian kid joined, but some rather heavily mentally ill as well. We started off to a round of teamkill-gallore and I threw the game into a corner. No fun, no options, no recommendation "

												This game has 2 major faults.1. Its supposed to be a one shot one hit foe everything, You, the enemeies, equipment, etc, well thats partially true. You can shoot whatever ya want BUT its almost IMPOSSIBLE to KILL anything but yourself. You can die in one hit but anything else? forget about it.2. Everything is smarter than you. Its supposed to be stealth playable but its like EVERYTHING KNOWS YOURE THERE. You cannot play it stealithly because it wont let you, and thats the kind of game its supposed to be. Everything practically has super sensitive trigger plates and you take one step and it knows youre there.it was discounted to $1.24 but with these faults its not even worth that. This game can be used as an insult for Christ sakes.			"

												its just sooo bad, stay away. UI is terrible, graphically unimpressive, animations are just a joke, AI is either superman or total potato.overall this feels like something i might have played more of if it were still 2005, but its not 2005 is it. the guns literally look like skins i would have pulled off of FPSBANANA 6 or 7 years ago...if you want a hardcore tac shooter to play, go buy Rainbow Six 3, its better in just about every way, and that is kinda sad seeing how RS3 is now a decade old... if you already have RS3 and want a new tac shooter to play of the same vein, be warned that this game is flawed in many waysoh and the game apparantly doesnt close properly, so now steam reports ive played over 150 hours... when in actuality its lucky if i even played for a full 30 minutes... and i love tac shooters, its just that bad.EDIT: this game is so bad that they sent out a free copy to those who bought it to give to a friend, but no ""friend"" would ever subject another to playing this game, and as such i have an extra copy that will more than likely just rot in my inventory, its that bad.

												I personally loved the fact that there is no private game. This let me move everyone to spectator before the game started. However, since people were still able to join in the middle of the game, they were adeptly griefing my whole team with impunity until I moved them to spectator mode or killed the server.There were a few bugs that stood out for their comedy. Everyone I played with had a button not working. One friend could not reload, one could not change rate of fire, and I could not run.The community for this is terrible. We never even got close to winning a game, often because of griefers.Everything moves terribly and unrealistically. It is altogether an atrocity and althrough it is rated worse than games in my library that don't start, I believe the rating is accurate. It is worse that this game started.			"

												For a game that prided itself on being the spiritual successor to the original Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six, this game is nothing like those games. It is an incomplete FPS game that had some really great ideas but executed them terribly. The movement is far too slow, feels clunky and only makes the game drag on. Weapon customization doesn't seem to do much, except for the situations where the bullets hit the environment and those moments seem to be very scarce in a game. Everyone dies from a single shot to anywhere on the person, which does not feel realistic at all since a shot to the arm would not immediately kill someone and also the fact that the main reason a person dies after being shot is more often than not blood loss, unless the person was shot in the head, which would lead to brain death. The customization menu does not function efficiently and it is a hassle to select every little option when you have to click left and right for each one and often times it is near impossible to know what certain options do for you and whether or not they are actually doing what they claim to do in game. Weapons are clunky and recoil doesn't feel real. Additionally, the controls feel weird, though I cannot explain why, and the tutorial does barely anything to help players understand how to use certain gameplay mechanics such as the breaching charges. The only thing that the tutorial said was that a certain door was meant to practice using breaching charges, but never indicated how or who can use them and honestly I still don't.I know I am being very picky, but I am a huge fan on realism in FPS games when it is promoted as such. For a game that had put so much effort into marketing its realism and tactical approach to the FPS game, I do not see anything different about this from other modern FPS games like CS and CoD other than some negative pointers, albeit the game does denote signs of its influences of the tactical FPS genre.In conclusion, this game had so many great ideas and the developers definitely were working towards making a good tactical FPS game that could be proudly considered a spiritual successor of Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six and even SWAT, but it falls short in every aspect and truly feels like an untested, unfinished mess. Since seeing Takedown: Red Sabre on Kickstarter I had high hopes for this game, but I can say that this game was extremely disappointing and was nothing like what I had expected at all.			"

												This game is a prime example of why Valve should be held accountable for the quality of the games they peddle.  It's fraud to sell a program like this for real money.  And Valve itself is a party to that fraud by not only offering this title but allowing it to be advertised on Steam.  In doing so they have fundamentally mislead their customers and permanently damaged their reputation.  The fact that this incredibly bad and buggy game is still offered on Steam, even after it was universally panned on the forums is furhter proof that Valve is complicite in a criminal enterprise.  The company as a whole should be liable for false advertising and selling defective products.			"

												I must say, while the graphics are not terribly lacking, the gameplay is nothing like it is described. In NO way is this a tactical shooter. Instead, it is an idea that has been run through a blender and thrown together poorly. While I admire the effort, it is not something I'd recommend whatsoever.			"

												Abysmal and broken, on top of being somehow WORSE than the now elderly games that it tires so hard to bring back (Rainbow 6 and SWAT). Bad graphics, broken gameplay, little content. This game is not the rebirth of a old type of FPS game but it's funeral.I only paid £1.60 or so for this and I still feel totally ripped off, even with a free gift copy thrown in! Track down the orginal Rainbow 6 games or a copy of SWAT 3 and 4. Much better than this turd that somehow managed to be worse than Ride to Hell!			"

												I was a huge fan of tactical shooters such as rainbow six or ghost recon. and I have to say this game fall short in many waysthe team controls for a start are pretty rubish, meaning that you cannot control 1 unit at a time causing any form of strategy to be difficult.also there is no move here function which I find crucial to any tactical shooterenemies die in just 1 hit no matter where you hit them and their AI ranges from complete idiot to constantly aware supersoldier for no apparent reasonthis game could probably be made better either through modding or by adding updates but alas both are unlikely to happen any time soon			"

The user Interface is not exactly user friendly either, in some menus with multiple steps when you go Back you are returned to the main menu instead of the last one.

												As many reviewers have stated, the game is buggy and needs a lot of work. However, the game is playable(barely) IF you can work past those glitches.So, what is there beyond a buggy game? Visually the game is beautiful! Impressive textures, and lighting, and while the animation leaves much to be desired, everything else is rather good.The game labels it's self as a return to old school tactical shooters, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Yes, it's tactical in the sense that one hit will kill you, and you should be extra wary of your surroundings if you want to live, but does not even come close to the tactical FPS that it claims to be a return to.Overall, it's not an overly terrible game, and certainly has potential and is a pleasant bit of eyecandy, but just doesn't seem ready for release. By all means, if you see this on special for a really low price, pick it up! Otherwise stick to classic Rainbow Six game.Unfortunately at it's current price, and current state, I can't recommend it.4/10			"

												What the hell.. If you're going to make a Rainbow-Six clone, at least get the AI right.The enemy seems to know who and where you are at all times, despite being silenced.There's not a single millisecond of delay, they see something moving they're already firing. Makes me wonder how they could take over that building in the first place without shooting each others.If you're creeping up a corner, they already know you're there and are waiting guns drawn.This is not fun nor would I qualify this as ""hard"", it takes all the tactics away.I'm used to FPS and my reaction time is usually under 250ms, add the rotational speed and aiming I'd guess it's around 750ms and yet i'm too slow. By the time I click, i'm already dying.And note that the NPC shouldn't be aware of my presence while I knew very well where he was (thanks to metagaming)Even the worst of the Rainbow-Six games is better than this. The controls are horrible, even while wearing the lightest armor, you feel like a pile of bricks.The only good points I noticed are the choice between entrypoints, the time limit, the subsonic rounds,FMJ/JHP. Whoever made these, obviously knew about the basics of weaponry.I'm sure a lot of work and passion went into this game, problem is, the finished product is not great, not great at all.It claims to be a successor to Rainbow-Six games but doesn't even include the mechanics we loved so much. I can understand they can't produce as many items/weapons as Rainbow-Six did but they could at least build the mechanics just like it. For example, In Takedown, a silenced 1911 pistol and a regular 1911 pistol are two different weapons and cannot be both used in the same mission, while in Rainbow-Six, you could just take the silencer off at any time, or put it back on.Another example would be the weapon slots, you only have a primary weapon and a pistol. The ""secondary weapons"" should be named ""Pistols"" since its all it includes. In Rainbow-Six, you had a pistol, along with a primary weapon and a secondary weapon, depending on which Rainbow-Six we're talking about, you could use two LMGs or two snipers if you wanted to, the freedom was there. Now i'm not against having only two weapons, as it makes sense, we're not the army after all. I'm just against the lack of freedom when it comes to choosing your secondary weapon, they could easily let other small guns as a secondary weapon, such has MPs and smaller shotguns or just allow any weapons to be chosen in those slots, so you could have two pistols or a shotty and a sniper. You know, whatever strikes your fancy.Maybe it's just me, maybe it's the 15 mins spent in-game. I'll eventually play more, although I doubt I'll change my mind, this is not a game i'd recommend.			"

												UPDATE 20.12.2014:I previously recommended this game because I thought it had some potential. I figured if more people strarted playing maybe the developers would try to fix it. I wanted to give this game a chance. Unfortunately it seems like the devs abandoned it. I do not reccomend buying it because you would be buying a broken game that will never be fixed.MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:After seeing all the negative reviews I decided to weigh in my own opinion.Sure, the game is still a bit rough around the edges, but it's fun to play on co-op.It has great potential and the developers are still working on updates and new content.If you are a tactical shooter fan you should support the developers instead of hatingon the game and just saying ""SWAT 4/Rainbow Six 3 are better"". Of course these are greatgames, but they have been around for 9 and 11 years respectively. Are you going to justkeep playing them for the next decade and discard everything else, because it's not as good?Or would you rather try and support the people that want to bring back the experience?If 14€/$15 is too steep just add the game to your wishlist and wait for a sale.There's no rush and it's easy to snag it for a fraction of the price. You evenget an extra copy so you can gift it to a friend and play together. Better yet,I'm sure all the people who hate the game so much they say ""it gave them cancer""will be more than happy to trade their extra copy or give it to you for free.Try reaching out to them.If all disappointed ""true tactical shooter fans"" tried to give constructive criticism,participate in the community and support the developer, we might eventually get the realRainbow Six and SWAT successor. The potential is there, it just needs more polish.TL;DR: This game is underrated. It has the potential, but we need to support thedevelopers instead of hating to make it work.Also, wait for a sale and buy it dirt cheap.Or trade for it since so many people have extra copies.PROS:- the weapons feel good and behave realistically- the maps are great- there is a lot of gear/equipment to choose- the graphics are good but still run decently on older computersCONS:- the AI: enemies are unpredictable and teammates are unreliable- there is no action planning- you can only give very basic orders to your teammatesPRO TIP: There is a very useful map guide from 505 Games on the Takedown community hub.

												OK, where to begin with this one?The return of the tactical shooter sounds like a great idea, right? Remember the old Rainbow Six games? They weren't just a typical run and gun kind of game. You had to think, you had to plan every move, and plan it well. It's clear that Takedown: Red Sabre tried to emulate those glory days, but unfortunately, it has fallen flat on its face.Let's start with the way the game handles. Characters move at a snail pace, I understand that this is supposed to be a tactical shooter, but that doesn't mean you have to move 3 inches a second. Crouching barely makes a difference save for allowing partners to shoot over you, and while there is a lean function, when aiming with certain weapons this can cause the scope to go off centre, and will cause you to miss the shot entirely.The AI can range from superhuman to completely braindead. I can't count how many times enemies have been able to see me through solid walls and kill me. I have also lost count of how many times the enemy has simply stood there and stared in the other direction, even when shooting with an unsurpressed weapon. I would strongly recommend not playing the single player, because if you die, the partner AI will stand there and most likely get shot one by one without doing anything.The weapons have very little diversity in them. Sure, there is a selection available, but most of them are different variotions of the same damn gun (The side arms are the biggest culprit of this). The weapons themselves don't feel good to handle. Every automatic rifle seems to kick way more than it should.The levels are incredibly complex, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that the game doesn't have a map, so you have no idea where you are. The game doesn't tell you the objectives during the mission either, so you'll spend most of the time wandering around aimlessly trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing.There are a number of other issues that the game suffers from. Servers don't work half the time, animations are jittery, the game looks bad even on high, and looks atrocious on low, even th sound that plays when the gun fires just stops sometimes for no reason. Everything about this game just screams unfinished. You can actually find proof of just how unfinished it is by looking in the steam directory for the game.I am lucky (or rather, unlucky) in the fact that I didn't actually spend anything on this game, as it was gifted to me. I simply cannot recommend this game in it's current state to anyone, it is simply not up to the standard that we were hoping for in a game like this. I am hoping that this will all eventually be resolved, but it seems less and less likely that it will, so for now this game isn't worth your time. Steer clear of this one guys.			"

												There are times when your first impression gives you a false perspective on a game, then you go back and play it and realize that the game is not that bad. My version of that is EVE Online. There are also games which you, the player, fail to see why people hate the game so much. For me, Orion: Dino Horde is a great example. Takedown: Red Sabre is neither of those examples. and wasn't worth the 99 cents I paid this past Summer Sale. From what I assume, this game is trying to be a cross between Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six, but fails at both. The weapons don't feel anywhere near as powerful and fun to use as Counter-Strike and the teammate AI is so bad that it feels more like a series of cheap deaths rather than a tactical experience.  I've had two of my squadmates in single player killed by a guy who seemingly appeared out of nowhere behind me and there was no indication that there was someone behind me. No voice clips, no gunfire from my AI teammates who were just standing around scratching their asses rather than checking in the directions that I couldn't face, nothing. The enemy AI is utterly cheap and the teammate AI rarely does anything to help you and more likely than not follows you around like a lost child looking for its parents.The online community is dead and for good reason. The control is extremely sluggish and I don't feel like can be stealthy and tactical when I can only walk from room to room rather than running from cover to cover. As stated before, the guns feel weak and the whole pace of the game is extremely off. I initally wanted to play the game long enough to get the trading cards and sell them to make a little return on investment but the game is so bad that I can't even play the game for that long. Avoid at all costs, not worth 99 cents in a sale and the current asking price of 4.99 is almost criminal.			"

												Think of COD: Modern Warfare [any], in a S.W.A.T. setting, only a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare.If they had spent more time on gameplay and gameplay mechanics, it would have turned out a lot better. Lemme list a few things:1: You always spawn in the same spot. This wouldn't be an issue, except for the following:1A: The AI knows exactly where you are at any given time. It might give you a second to two to react, is about all the concession you'll get there.1B: There are a limited number of map navigation choices from your spawn point, without getting shot, due to the above.2: The movement mechanics are reminiscent of CounterStrike. Only, not in a good way. It's like putting CounterStrike in Tar, and trying to move. Combined with the above, will leave you dead quite often.3: Grenades are more of a distraction and danger to the player, than the AI, due to the above.There were several other things that should have either been fixed, or not implemented at all, which slip my mind.Not something i intend to go back and play again. I'd rather get on S.W.A.T. 4 or CoD [much as i hate it].			"

												So. I buy this game during a sale for the irresistable price of 30p. Sound good? Yes. At the time. For you see although the game was cheaper than a packet of jawbreakers and came with 3 extra copies, I do NOT recomend it. That is not to say that it is a bad game. If you're into heist/cop games, then this might just be for you. But personally, nah. It was clunky, poor AI and the guns... Look, my point is. Unless you're super into this genre and can get past all the issues that are so very obvious. Then don't bother. You're better off buying those jawbreakers.4/10 Unimpressed			"

												The game is very clunky and I feel like I have to fight the controles every step of the way, it is not smooth what so ever. The game I understand is supposed to be about strategy, tactics and key timing but your default speed in my opinion is a little too slow. I also had a lot of trouble with spawn points and it just seemed like no mater what type of armor you wore you die just as quick. I'm glade I didn't have to pay for this game because it clearly needs a lot of work done and unfortunately because it seemes like they rushed to put the game out I don't think this game is going to recover anytime soon with such bad reviews and poor gameplay. They talked big game but in the end this game just didn't deliver. I give it a 3/10 just because it has the right idea, the pieces were all there but they haven't figured how to put them together just yet.			"

												My experience in this game so far: Pros:+ Tries to be like Rainbow Six+ Looks like an older generation Rainbow Six Game (Nostalgia?)Cons:- Looks like an older generation Rainbow Six Game- Enemy AI isn't really smart, but shoots fast and pretty acurate- Multiplayer lacks options like password protection, friends only, friendly fire off, kicking in game, banning in game, muting in gameMy experience for the multiplayer so far: I gave a friend of mine a Key, so we could play a bit of the co-op. The first round went well enough - only that I started to hear a russian kid talking to his family. (Probably should have done his dishes, but failed to do so - I really couldn't understand) The next round, said russian kid starts to shoot us (Teammates) in the head - procedes to talk gibberish. Probably insulted our upbringing, or our parents. Maybe he asked us, if we could do his dishes. I really couldn't understand.I tried to kick him, or remove him from the game - put to no avail. We restarted the server. Now more than just that russian kid joined, but some rather heavily mentally ill as well. We started off to a round of teamkill-gallore and I threw the game into a corner.

You can shoot whatever ya want BUT its almost IMPOSSIBLE to KILL anything but yourself. You can die in one hit but anything else? forget about it.2. Everything is smarter than you. Its supposed to be stealth playable but its like EVERYTHING KNOWS YOURE THERE. You cannot play it stealithly because it wont let you, and thats the kind of game its supposed to be. Everything practically has super sensitive trigger plates and you take one step and it knows youre there.it was discounted to $1.24 but with these faults its not even worth that.

												If the midnight TV ads for Dr. Ho's electrocution equipment was the king of false-advertisement then TakeDown is the counter-part. With clunky mechanics, terrorists as dull as a man named Chester and features equivelant to a Romanian jail it's worth to take note that compared to the jail it costs to play this game. The sound is dreary and levels are as interesting as motel drapes. Not to mention that the majority of levels feel like re-hash from the developer's previous works, take for example ""Radar Storm"" which seems oddly familiar to a particular level in ""Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear"". The main menu is non-linear as Duke Nukem Forever and as 'feature-rich' as a 1920s telegraph pole. Especially the annoyance of repeated main menu booting-before you do absolutately anything else after anything else that you've done. I'd rather spend a day with Paulie Shore and Piers Morgan on a tugboat while we keep running out of canola to propel the behemoth. The weapons are lackluster at best, frankly if this game would've been converted as a paintball or NERF style action, it would've gotten more customers.Although that may not be true, the truth of the matter is; Hard-Core, tactical gamers are eager and ready. Ready for ""THE"" next one in this genre. Not a revolutionary new engine, cinematic storyline. Up to date technology and the correct formula as the past. Most of all put some love into the damn thing and not rush for revenue. Would I recommend this game? No.I'd recommend going to a home-basing party with MacCauley Culkin.			"

												As many reviewers have stated, the game is buggy and needs a lot of work. However, the game is playable(barely) IF you can work past those glitches.So, what is there beyond a buggy game? Visually the game is beautiful! Impressive textures, and lighting, and while the animation leaves much to be desired, everything else is rather good.The game labels it's self as a return to old school tactical shooters, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Yes, it's tactical in the sense that one hit will kill you, and you should be extra wary of your surroundings if you want to live, but does not even come close to the tactical FPS that it claims to be a return to.Overall, it's not an overly terrible game, and certainly has potential and is a pleasant bit of eyecandy, but just doesn't seem ready for release. By all means, if you see this on special for a really low price, pick it up! Otherwise stick to classic Rainbow Six game.Unfortunately at it's current price, and current state, I can't recommend it.4/10			"

												This game is not currently at a level in which it is fun, other than as a troll.Those are the only people you will find playing with you. There is no ""Friendly Fire off"" nor any auto team kick for team killers. Nor is there a votekick option.This combination means that instantly everyone tries to kill each other on a team, unless they know each other.For a game about team work, this oversight instantly breaks any ability of the game to function within its own parameters.For gunplay, it's clunky, has odd choices in controls (Auto-stick leaning is not a common choice for people), and the bots will generally kill you instantly.The lack of quick movement, a cover system, or any cool gadgets such as SWAT 4 provided, means you just walk around a corner and flip a coin to see if you get shot instantly or not. So by yourself or with others, this game is not complete nor fun. I would rate it a decent student submission, and little more.			"

												I wonder if the review sites were being sarcastic when they ranked this game so high, because it's an unfinished pile of garbage. If you watched the trailer videos and bought this game, you'll soon realize that you've been sold the levels used to make the trailer, not an actual playable game. I spent 45 minutes on the first level simply because the final objective didn't exist, and the only way to finish the level was to close the application and write this scathing review.			"

												I bought this game a while ago as a joke for me and my friends, seeing as it was only around 80p at the time. The game did not disappoint. From enemies that would shoot you on site with pinpoint accuracy and turning back around. To them turning into ♥♥♥♥ wits that have never heard of a gun before and have never heard of basic movement. Oh, but it doesn't stop there. The 'hardcore' aspect of the game amounts to enemies killing you in one or two shots even with heavy armor, or having the whole team wiped in less than 10 seconds because ... I don't know, they sniffed out your presence from a mile away. If there is anything to take from Takedown: Red Sabre, is that it will make you and your friends laugh from how bad the game is. So thanks Takedown, you're the best gag gift money can buy.			"

												Not as horrible as I thought but still not the best, if you're a SWAT/ Rainbow Six fan like I am, look elsewhere for a for a tactical shooter. The enemy AI is very inconsistant, you will find enemies that'll be incredibly stupid or have a reaction time to rival an aimbot. The teamate AI is very bad, you might as well go alone than take an AI team with you, I was tellin' my team to cover a door while I sliced a pie around a corner when I turned around... I saw my team staring at the floor. If you're really good at tactical games like this it could be enjoyable with friends if you just wanna waste some time Overall: 3.5/10			"

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 24, I have never touched a cigarette.

												Bleh. It's not too terrible, but it's not ultimately good either. Nontheless, thanks to my pal RedAlpha for gifting me this game, since it's the thought that counts. Anyway, the graphics are decent and the controls are acceptable, but the AI is clunky and ruins the gameplay in Singleplayer. Gameplay in general is underwhelming and the game overall is a pretty good idea or promise versus a poor execution. Another problem I have is with the loadouts, even if you make and save changes to the weapons of each of the loadouts, the game doesn't acknowledge it, unless I'm doing something incorrectly. Maybe some multiplayer might change this review, but until then this game is pretty well below average in rating for good concept and premise, pretty good controls and appreciatable graphics, but the framerate/game overall is too laggy, the AI is unrealistic and pretty dull, gameplay is underwhelming especially with the lack of excitement-inducing things like music, and the illusion of the ability to customize one's set of gear. Multiplayer is unchecked, however.3/10 - Not terrible, but not too good either. Could use a handful of improvement/work. (Yeah, to say the least.)			"

												Not sure what to really say about this game. For one, it's one of those half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥mediocre game titles, where little no effort was put into it. At the same time, it's one of those games that drain the life out of you while you play. (Another notable game like this is Day One: Garry's Incident...) Naturally, this game should have been funny; with all it's flaws and such, but it's not. It just feels sad and poor: like watching a homeless guy getting robbed of his shopping cart; and then getting beat up by the robber, who is using the homeless guy's shopping cart to beat him up. It's just a poor gaming experience overall.To begin this mess, we have the tutorial: a simple game mode that should detail the game's mechanics, simple enough. The first thing you'll ever notice, is just how sub-par the graphics are. Almost looking like an Xbox 360 kinda game graphics. (A quick glance at the graphics settings beforehand yield none. (This game has no graphics settings.)) Anyway, as I progress thru this game, the second thing worth noting are the sluggish movement/controls. (Now, it's quite common for a tactical FPS to have this type of feel, but this in no way helps this game.) The commands were easy enough, so I continued with the tutorial. Not expecting much from this, I ended up encountering a bug: at the section where it tells me to ""throw a grenade,"" nothing happens. I charge up the throw meter, and nothing, Can't throw the grenade, can't switch to my other weapons, absolutely nothing. Luckily, I could skip this section by opening the door to the next section. (Funny thing is, after opening this door, all the controls self-corrected. Everything was back to normal.) Anyway, tutorial ends with a shooting range, nothing special. (Although, a glitch occured were I clearly had an AK, but the weapon icon showed a typical M4 Rifle.?) Now on to the main event!The actual game is atrocious! As soon as you start an actual level, you are thrown into the mission, (with your buddies,) to complete the objectives. But no matter how hard I tried, no matter how much effort I put into this game; I was unable to complete one objective.The enemy AI are like super bots. They already know where you are. As soon as you alert them; they seek you, and they will find you! They also have aimbot, so trying to get away from their shots is almost impossible. They kill you and your team faster than you can say; ""Hocus pocus boppity boo!"" In fact, you stand a better chance without your teammates. Only problem is: you die in two or three hits. What a joke. Makes playing this game a pain. And the whole game is like that too. Absolutely atrocious!As for the multiplayer, there was no one playing. So I quit, and uninstalled this sorry♥♥♥♥♥excuse of a video game.If I were anybody, I wouldn't spend a single dime on this heap♥♥♥♥♥♥of a game. Only if you got it for free, then it actually might be worth a laugh. Other than that, don't bother with this.As a side note: While playing this game, I later found out that I had three instances of the game running. That's right! Three different windows of the same game! That's the first time I've seen a game on Steam do that.			"

												3 words work of art. I would first like to talk about the AI since it is obviously one of the best things about the game, I can see that the team at 505 has spent a great deal of time coding and♥♥♥♥♥♥for the AI giving them aimbot, wallhack and other kind of stuff that you see from terrorists irl. Secondly level design the way that enemys are placed perfectly so there aimbot and wallhacks can be put to great use. Thirdly I would just like to let everone know this is by far the best strategic pfs out there recommend it to everyone great fun GLHF			"

												Wow! This game I thought would be good.  Turns out, it sucked! They say it's realistic, but the AI kill you in less than a second.  It mainly needs everything, it's not closed to finish.  The game itself does not look anywhere close to a game that came out in 2013.  If I were to play this without knowing the year it came out, I would say 2004!  They should leave the price at $1.50 because that's how much it's truly worth.Look at the game itself, I made a review:

An amazing MMORPG FPS Indie platform adventure game for all ages! This game comes chock full of five, yes five full maps! Thats four more then Dota 2 has to offer. Also included is a heart touching story mode that will grip you from the very start. Just when you thought that was all there is multiplayer! Play with friends or with internet people, Use their in game chat to send out your orders! All in all this game is worth way more then the asking price of $1.49 USD.

												I like this game.This game is very challenging, the AI is really difficult to defeat.Maybe that is the reason why a lot of people don't like this game.If this game is too difficult for you, you can give your opinion instead of claiming that this is a bad game because the AI kicked your♥♥♥♥♥..You have to play this game slowly and be carefull.This game is more hardcore than the Rainbow Six Vegas series or Rainbow Six Lockdown.Some people complain about the the reload animations.In real life you can press on a m4/m16 based weapon bolt catch with your thumb, while others hit it with their hand.In this game it's hit with the hand, nothing wrong with that animation.Some things to improve:A big issue for me is the lack of advanced video options for the moment.This was already announced to be changed soon.Also a grenade crosshair would be nice.Sometimes the AI is not really smart and their skill seems inconsistent.Sometimes they kill you very quickly, other times they don't even hit you or see you.I like to play the ""Tango hunt"" mode of this game and the coop is also cool, if you play with experienced players.If you don't want an arcade shooter, but a more difficult game than this is for you!The price of this game was also very good, i got it for 1,39 and got a free gift copy with it.I bought this game again with the assumption to get another gift copy, but then i got just 1 copy of the game... that's not cool.

I'm no software developer nor game developer but I'm pretty sure this game needs lots of improvements. Such as jumping, quickswitch should be faster, health should not be displayed as a human icon. Took me a while to understand this game's controls. Also- please add melee and the graphics are too simple. Sound effects should be improved along with the HUD.			"

												I highly recommend this game for play with friends. It's very fun, and, yes, you die a lot, but how fun is it to just get shot in the face a bunch of times, and heal in a few seconds? This game is not well-developed, but its worth the price (or at least the price during sales). You die a lot, you can kill friends just as quickly as enemies kill you, it's a ton of fun. A lot of people say things like ""bad AI"" but really they're saying ""I can't win"" or ""I'm not skilled enough."" When you play this game, you either get good or die. But in most cases both. Ok, majority cases both.			"

												This game is not that bad if you like slow paced gameplay, but really need improvements on everything.While playing, it just felt like a very basic close quarter version of Arma gameplay which is a good thing and what I was expecting from this type of game. If curious, you should buy it when it is on sale. I don't recommend paying the full price if you don't like slow paced tactical gameplay.My little review and complaints are based on singleplayer missions and overall game mechanics because multiplayer is somewhat ""dead"" right now, I can't find decent pings on my region.The game feels like a ""beta"". Glass reflection is odd, the movement need to be more responsive and less awkward, AI reaction is fine but how it detects sound is sometimes unfair, AI hearing your shoots are ok, but hearing when you walk slowly or open doors is just strange, why opening doors are so noisy? Why no AI footsteps sounds? And their sound cues/chatting are so odd. If they can hear me why can't I hear them? And the AI should move more, not just stand in some corner waiting but don't make it charge like a suicidal retard. I really desire that in the future this game gets improved. I will recommend this game because I did enjoyed playing, but like I said, it feels like a beta, unpolished do be more precise.			"

												Like many others, I was really happy to see this game on kickstarter and the ideology seemed great, being a spiritual follower of swat and rainbow six games, with a solid team behind it. But also, like many others... I was VERY disappointed in the ""final"" product. -What more can I add after reading some of the reviews.. There really are no redeeming qualities, its disappointing in every field, and lacks many, many features already featured in tactical games published 10 years ago! I don't know if a low budget is to blame, or the lack of interest in gamers when the product was financed, but this game is still months of work and a ton of money away from being even nearly complete. Too bad no one is playing it anymore to keep up an incentive to update and patch it...tl,dr: dont buy this game			"

												Bleh. It's not too terrible, but it's not ultimately good either. Nontheless, thanks to my pal RedAlpha for gifting me this game, since it's the thought that counts. Anyway, the graphics are decent and the controls are acceptable, but the AI is clunky and ruins the gameplay in Singleplayer. Gameplay in general is underwhelming and the game overall is a pretty good idea or promise versus a poor execution. Another problem I have is with the loadouts, even if you make and save changes to the weapons of each of the loadouts, the game doesn't acknowledge it, unless I'm doing something incorrectly. Maybe some multiplayer might change this review, but until then this game is pretty well below average in rating for good concept and premise, pretty good controls and appreciatable graphics, but the framerate/game overall is too laggy, the AI is unrealistic and pretty dull, gameplay is underwhelming especially with the lack of excitement-inducing things like music, and the illusion of the ability to customize one's set of gear. Multiplayer is unchecked, however.3/10 - Not terrible, but not too good either. Could use a handful of improvement/work. (Yeah, to say the least.)			"

As a huge fan of games like Swat, Rainbow Six, and Counter Strike I was looking forward to this the moment I saw it. A revival of the Tactical Shooter genre? Oh wow, count me in! With devs who worked on Tom Clancy games and freaking HALO?! WHAT! Count me in, this has GOT to be good...right?Boy were we suckered. Promises of being the revival of a long dead genre turned into not just a bad game, but beyond that. This is simply one of the worst products I have ever bought, and it pains me to say that. On release it was a buggy mess with features not working left and right. What we saw in demo's and videos couldn't possibly be the same thing as this released final game, but it was.Controls are clunky. The AI is terrible. The guns shoot and feel even worse. The maps are nice but that's all irrelevant when the mechanics of the game are awful. Steamcharts says the game has an average of 16 people online at peak times in the past 30 days, with an all time peak of 1,071 on release, which was only September 20, 2013, about 2 months exactly ago. The game is already dead. I seriously felt suckered and swindled out of $15, prying on peoples hope for a revival of the genre. This game was such a disaster and as a result of it, I will never blindly give money to people (kickstarter), or pre-order a game again. Instead of this, spend $10 for Rainbow Six 3 Gold, and use the extra $5 to go buy a cheeseburger[Edit, and of my 3 hours played, probably about 2 and a half of those hours were trying to get the game to work period.]			"

												Played this game for about an hour and never think of going back. The only reason I bought this game was because it was a dollar. But boy it is not even worth that. The maps are terribly designed the AI half of the time do not even look at you but somehow turn their back and a quick second later shoot you. Now the graphics  are OK and thats an over exageration. I say stay with SWAT 4 or Rainbow Six. Stay away from this game			"

												This game it's a version of SWAT4 but much better at the graphics, but the gameplay is not good as I thought, every enemy sees you like through everything like they got a frickin' wallhack so you cannot sneak. Until you won't fix that issue, it's just horrible. So in the conclusion, I do not recommend this game until it won't get fixed.			"

												Do not get this game, while I admit I am slightly biased towards shooters, I am a fan of tactical FPS and Third Person Shooters. This game brings neither element to the table and in fact is a glaringly terrible game. But enough of my hatred, let the actual review get underway shall we?Pros:some variety (although rather meager) in loadout options.Attention to detail on the weapons is notable.AI does seem rather sharp.Cons:The weapons just feel wrong in this, they feel closer to capguns with overexaggerated recoilSound FX are just...noWhile I did list it as a pro, the loadout section just doesn't feel like theres ENOUGH variety.I understand that JHP rounds are designed for soft targets but even a good bulletproof vest isn't going to stop 18 of them. Conclusion: Don't bother with this game. I would say go pick up a copy of Rainbow Six: Vegas 2. "

												Horribly dissapointing! If you want some realistic or tactical shooters than pick up one of the followign instead: Insurgency, ARMA3, Rising Storm or DAYZ. This game looked wicked, a throwback to the old school Rainbow Six/Ghost Recon style games but this one has so many issues and is just not well made at all. Like I said above, pick up one of those games mentioned above, been playing Insurgency lately and that is the game I was hoping Takedown would be. Stay away from this game even if its on sale for 90% off, there is a ton of issues and nothing that is really redeemable.You're welcome for the warning!These devs have now stopped supporting the game and are working on a new game. Took ya money and ran! Dear devs, The Game Still Sucks! If you are interested in this genre, please buy INSRUGENCY instead, it is 1000 times better than this trash. Don't trust these devs!			"

												I love this game, all the criticism is completely unfounded as of now. It was buggy as hell at first release but the frequent patches have improved it significantly. One of the best FPS tactical shooters made. When all patched up & bugs removed(Open mic is the most annoying! Just disable VOIP until they fix it.) & a few features added this will be better than SWAT 4, Rainbow 6 & Ghost Recon series. My compliments to the devs & best wishes for their success!			"

												Possibly the worst ""tactical"" shooter game to have ever shown it's diseased corpse to the public. You'll have a hard time finding a worse example of an expensive failure, a game that was meant to be a tribute to classics like SWAT 4 and Rainbow Six Gold, but instead became utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pros- the game has guns or something. And Some Voice acting.Cons.- outdated graphics.- clunky, slow controls.- possibly the dumbest AI of any FPS game ever. Free to play games have smarter AI than this.- crap gun sounds- crap special effects- limited, repetitive maps and missions.- enemy AI with lazer aim, capable of killing you instantly the moment they see you far faster than a human can reasonably react. Sometimes they respond to you before they even see you.- Useless AI team.- Limited gun customization.- worthless soldier customization (nonexistent)- dead multiplayer mode, good luck ever finding a match.

												It was as cheap as poo in a brown paper bag, set aflame by the hatred of lost time and money. Its essence hanging in the air, giving off a stench so strong and thick. So nothing that commends this game can be seen or heard. The very thought of positive feedback drown out by loss and sorrow.  At the very least, I commend this game for being the first to ever draw me in with it's sale price only to have the community feedback destroy every ounce of optimism (of the very few) I had long before the game even began.Being that as it may,  it was someone's project at some time or another. That said, one must realize that it is a game an art. Weather it'd be good or bad it still has my respect. Someone accomplished a dream with this game, in the end only to have it burn. But make no mistake: it made me feel good for not having many dreams, and for that I am truly greatful.			"

												Where do i begin with writing this review. Well for starters i wanna point a few aspects out. For one, the developer is extremely small and yet very active on the steam forums, which is a huge plus. Keeping in touch with the fanbase and owners of the game to help improve Takedown is a great way to get this game in the state its suppose to be in. With that said, this game is far from complete, along with huge improvements that need to be made in order for this game to stand up among the great Tactical shooters on the market. Even though this game has huge flaws and gaming breaking problems. Takedown has a feature ahead of itself to be a rather extremely good game. After numorious updates over the course of 5 months, the game is starting to head in that direction but the key aspect that has to be addressed is the A.I. Thanks to some forum members, it seems to be getting into that direction as we speak due to the community tweaking up the A.I file. I have tested this out myself and i have to say I'm rather impressed. Sure you will still get one shotted a lot of the time but the A.I react different this time around. It's not an instint kill when they see you right away. It feels as if now when they first see you, they don't react to you right away unless they have encountered you before hand. Which to me gives a new level of play. Makes me think more harder and how i wanna approach the enemy. Yet even with those changes, the A.I still has its problems but with future updates, I'm sure that will change. Can't wait for that update to come out down the road. I have not gotten a chance to try out the Multiplayer yet due to having a few crashes mess up my time with that mode. However it only happens ever so offten for me. With the state that the game is in at the moment, its a step in the right direction but it still has a big up hill battle it has to face in order to stand up to genre its trying to be. I don't regret getting this game as gift cause I know the dedicated fans behind this game wil help improve this game dramaticly. After all this game is suppose to be community driven so let's make it happen. For those of you out there who really like the idea and want this game to be what it stands for. Show your support and get your concerns and opinions out there. The devs are very active, let your voice be heard and get this game fixed for the better, cause honestly it deserves it.			"

Reminds me a lot of the old Rainbow Six games. I'm really liking it. The AI does have it's fair share of sucking (Meaning, some of the bots just stand facing the corner, but know when you are behind them at the end of a long hall), but I still like the game. Move slow, check your corners, and play with friends if possible. If there are updates to the AI this would be a no brainer.			"

Read into that what you will.0/10 not worth the bandwidth to download, and I have unlimited bandwidth.EDIT: 02.JAN.15, 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpfulLOOKS LIKE THE DEVS ARE STILL READING THE REVIEWS, FOLKS!

												This game is brilliant and realistic, it lets the players use tactical skills to fulfill a certain amount of missions and challenges. The realism is good in this game as you get shot about 3 times max and your dead, just like real life. The controls are average but you can get used to it. I have completed a mission with my friend so i know how the game works and all that shenanigans. Overall really good game.			"

												I can't say enough bad about this game. If you want a ""REAL"" tactical shooter go with Rainbow Six 3 Gold Edition, it's here on Steam and its much better, though old.For a more modern one, though it's more of a military game, try Insurgency, the paid version of it. It's worth the money.Here's how TRS is doing http://steamcharts.com/app/236510#48h Game was basically DOA, player count dropped rapidly, and for a good reason. There are some out there that defend the game, giving reasons like budget (actually got a crapton of money from the publisher so moot point) and limited dev time (finish the game first then), all aren't good excuses for this mess.

												When I played ArmA for the first time, I thought the AI was bad. Then I played this game.The AI has perfect aim, it never misses. It also tracks your movement through walls, so peeking a corner will result in certain death. And since there is not much movement sounds and the AI is silent most of the time, you get continuously jump-scared. NPCs also like to spawn wherever they like, so getting shot at start of a round is not an impossibility. All of this makes the game quite hard.(I actually tried to complete one level with my friend, but after 1h of playing we gave up.)Movement is very slow, even when sprinting. Audio is really bad, there is no music (except the 40 sec loop on main manu), voice acting is really awkward as are all poses and animations in the game.And fall damage is insane. Falling more than 50cm will kill you.			"

												This game has alot of bad reviews and for good reason. The game is terrible to play alone, its not a modern run and gun game and the AI feels godlike at times. Prepare to want to put your fist through your monitor if you want to invest any time into learning this game.With that said, this game is alot of fun to play with a dedicated 4 man group and very challenging. Once you get the hang of the game and understand how to play around the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy AI the game becomes extremely fun and challenging. The levels are extremely hard, bordering on unbeatable unless you really know what you're doing and are in a very serious tactical mindset. But boy oh boy does it feel rewarding to complete a mission with no casualties in a 4 man group.Pros:-Very difficult-Meant for 4 player Co-op-Tactical shooter, not a run and gun game-Intense teamwork and communication requiredCons:-420 no scope AI-Deaths can feel extremely frustrating-Maps can get stale after you learn them all-Not for casual FPS players			"

												This game is an abomination, the AI is quite possibly the least consistant in any game to date. Sometimes they'll just look at you, not moving an inch, other times, they'll instantly kill you the SECOND you think about opening a door. Sometimes you'll breach a door and three guys will just look at you, other times they will wipe your whole squad instantly. The game is hilariously unfinished, it's pretty damn bad, but at $.50 or whatever I paid for this and copies for my friends, it's worth it. It's absolutely hilarious.If you're a hardcore shooter fan looking for the next Rainbow Six, don't buy it.If you're a casual shooter fan looking for a new game, don't buy it.If you're just wanting to buy a game to play with your friends for a one night session of laughs at programming, I fully endorse this purchase. This is the epitome of dice rolling in shooter games. The AI will either crush you, or you will crush it. Good luck.			"

												Takedown Red Sabre trys to be a tactical shooter. It wants to be like the old Rainbow Six / Ghost Recon games but did it reach its goal? To make it short: ♥♥♥♥ING NO!Negative PointsBugs- This game has no bugs, it is a bug! (and I dont talk about insects..). Seriously this game is so broken!- Random game crashes are common, random frame drops are very common and you have to restart the game to fix this.- Bugs like glitching through objects, animation bugs or bugs when you switch the weapon are so common that you think that they are ""features"".AI- Ore collectors from C&C Red Alert are real brainiacs compared to the AI from this game.- Player detection seems to be totally random. Sometimes the AI see you behind the doors/walls or detect you from all over the map and sometimes they just ignore you even when you stand directly in front of them. - AI uses aimbot and wallhack. This is so much fun.. not!- Team mates are totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dont react to orders.Graphics- Not the worst but far away from good.Multiplayer- Connection problems, lag, no fun!- Totally dead by now.Gameplay- The game react so slow to your keyboard input (or sometimes it just ignores it)- You die so fast and you cant heal yourself.. no fun especially with the hacking AI!- Hit detection, shooting, walking - everything feels so wrong.- There is no ""tactical gameplay"". You can just hide, lean around a corner and pray that the aimbot AI dont instantly kills you.Sound- Cheap- Character voice lines often switch between german and english..Miscellaneous- Most weapons, most attachments and all body armor beside heavy armor are completely useless.- The menu sucks, configuring your loadout is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥- You cant jump.- Fall damage is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!- Time limit from 60 minutes.. lelNeutral PointsGerman translation- Not sure if I should cry or laugh about the horrible german translation.. they should have used google translator for a better translation.Maps- The design of the most maps is ok, you got different ways and different spawnpoints also different map themes.- Not many maps.Positive PointsNoneConclusionThe game had potential but the execution was done sooo badly. The game is unfinished and broken all the way. Save your time & money cause this game is part of the category ""failed early access games"".			"

												No. Just no. Bugs, the inability to command your squad, missing sound effects. This is just a really unfinished product that was shipped out too early. While touted as ""tactical"", the inability to command your squad reduces their function to just additional lives in single player. The AI, both friendly and enemy, is just god awful, with your men not reacting to an enemy literally meters away.Conclusion:It's $4.99 for a reason. Hell, it's not even worth that much. I paid $15 for this. Please don't make the same mistake. You'd literally be better off spending that money on something like skins or hats in CS:GO or TF2.			"

												Another game that isn't anything like advertised. They'd like you to think it's a SWAT 4 or a Rainbow Six (pre Vegas). It's not. It's a buggy dull shooter where your tactics are ""Do my guys stand still or move with me?"". There's no control beyond that. Entry points are arbriatary, AI is a joke. The developer says everything that's wrong with the game is because of the ""hardcore and realistic nature of the game"". Since when did hardcore or realistic mean♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Quite frankly it feels unfinished. That a folder in the game is called Early Access (supposedly from the beta version but this game was never an Early Access title) is a little worrying.			"

												I truly don't believe this game is as terrible as everyone says it is. However, it isn't a very good game either. If you are a fan of the old Rainbow Six games (anything before Lockdown), then you will find enjoyment for a maximum of a few hours. The game tries to be a successor to Rainbow Six, but there is no reason to buy this game over RS3 on Steam, besides slightly better visuals. I enjoyed playing each level online with a friend, but there is not as much replay value as Rainbow Six games. The AI is botchy and unintelligent, which is especially frustrating when you are trying to command a team. What I am basically getting at is that it is just a mediocre version of the Rainbow Six games that introduces nothing new (no story, no characters, no interesting objectives, etc.).			"

												NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALLThis game can be resumed perfectly by these quotes from reviewers (to name a few):GameSpot: ""An unfinished, broken mess of a tactical shooter that offers not even one redemptive bright spot.""NowGamer: ""Whether a future patch will rectify a lot of problems with Takedown: Red Sabre or not is irrelevant; Serellan should not have released a game this unfinished in the first place. The core of the game could be good, but not until a number of issues have been resolved.""jparker782 at MetaCritic: ""This is a terrible, unfinished mess. This game will go down in history as one of the worst crowd-funded indie games ever. It is the Atari E.T. of indie games. Many were following this game's development for over a year. The developer has released an alpha product and is selling it as a finished game. It most certainly is not. AVOID THIS GAME.""Jimbo364 at MetaCritic: ""I thought this game looked pretty dry from the previews I've seen. It didn't seem like their was much to the game at all. Seemed like a bland version of SWAT/Rainbow 6 games. When the game came out, it confirmed what I was thinking, but it was much much worse than I ever believed.First problem I had was options. Graphic options are pathetic with only v-sync, overall quality, brightness, and resolution. No way to tweak specific elements. In-game you can not access the options menu at all. You can not change graphics, controls, sound, etc. AT ALL in-game.Another problem I had was the gameplay. Controls work for the most part, but the movement felt stiff. Sometimes the game will glitch your gun when you switch and leave you stuck unarmed. AI is spotty at best. Teammates can not being commanded to move anywhere, they only follow like sheep and get in the way. They rarely get any enemies. Enemy AI is mediocre, they don't react to your unsuppressed gunfire all the time and won't shoot you even you stand right in front of them sometimes. Also the timer is obnoxiously in the middle of the screen, something that can just be on the corner of the screen.Multiplayer flat out didn't work at all. Insulting to anyone that wanted to play with others.The overall presentation and gameplay of the game is generic to put it mildly. Should of just called this game Tactical Shooter, because it does nothing to stand out from the crowd despite being much newer than similar games. If your going to revive a genre, take what was good about it and refine was not so good about it. There is no heart to this game, it's a cold and lifeless.""OVERALL:An unfinished piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that never should have released at this state. The game is utterly broken and your A.I. mates aren't even working and helping you properly. The early Rainbox Six and SWAT games are a milion times better than this wannabe tactical shooter. Ignore this game's existence and do not support developers that screws over their customers. This is the dark side of crowfunding gone wrong!BOTTOM LINE:Stick with games that work and that are fun... like any Rainbow Six and SWAT games! And honestly, I wonder if ""The WarZ"" is worst than this Red Sabre...RATING:0.0 / 10If only another SWAT game would come out someday... there is at least a new Rainbow Six: Patriot coming eventually...

												Okay, so this game is hard. It's hard as hell. But it's also the most tactical shooter out there and I'll tell you what, those who state otherwise clearly have never experienced actual situations like this.Now I don't claim to be a soldier or Spec Ops guy, I'm really not, but I am an experienced Airsofter who specialises in CQB and has trained with a PMC on a number of occasions to get better at building clearing and this game exactly replicates that experience. You got spotted by one guy for a split second? You bet your♥♥♥♥♥he shouted something and it chained all the way through the building so everyone heard it. Doorways are murderous, exactly as with airsoft and real life (They're called death funnels for a reason guys), and the fact that you die almost instantly and have very little ammo is exactly as it should be. Here's the thing: none of us gamers are trained soldiers. We like to think we are because we play stuff like Ghost Recon or Battlefield or even Arma, but we aren't and people claiming that this game is so unrealistic should really try going Urban Airsofting and see what it's like. Enough of that though, lets talk about good parts:-You have as much health as the enemy. One good burst and you're dead. That's awesome, that's fair and it teaches you to be damn slow and take your time like you should.- Your team are so damn important and so is communication. Your weapon won't be ideal for taking out everything at every range so you're reliant on allies and if you want to take something like a shotgun suppression isn't an option so again you rely on your team, which is great to see since so many games are too scared to make you useless in certain situations.- Enemy AI keep their eyes on their entrances. This is a basic principal of interior fighting and it's good to see that the Ai actually stick to it. If you lose one guy going through the door, you'll lose anyone who tries to follow him becuase the Ai will be aiming right at that door and has initiative, just as it should be.- No sticky cover system, if you want cover you find something solid and get behind it, no button doing ir for you. That's how I want my shooters to be.- Decent weapon customisation (Only one Shotgun which sucks though)- It's different. This game doesn't fit the ""Tactical Shooter"" genre that most people have created. It's a brutally realistic shooter whereby a single mistake kills you. None of this regening health, easy stealth nonesence that people associate with the genre nowerdays, just you, a gun and a building to clear. The simple hardcore nature is what defines this game.Cons:- You move slow as hell and it feels floaty, this is forgivable if you have patience but the lack of an ability to move quickly when needed is a pain.- There's only one shotgun, which sucks since they're so important in this kind of combat.- The Menus are a pain to navigate.- Allied Ai aren't smart, they'll open fire with unsuppressed weapons as soon as they spot a target.- Enemy Ai can feel rather Aimbot-like at times, and don't appear to be effected by recoil.- Certain things like placing charges can be clunky.So all in all, a damn good game that people seem to be put off from for all the wrong reasons. It's not for everyone, hell it's not for most people, but if you understand interior combat and how fast and brutal it truly is, this game is worth it. Unpolished, granted, but still a very realistic interpretation of building to building combat.			"

												Worst game Ive bought on Steam.

Those are the gems of tactical shooters that never translated into the console era.			"

												Okay, so this game is hard. It's hard as hell. But it's also the most tactical shooter out there and I'll tell you what, those who state otherwise clearly have never experienced actual situations like this.Now I don't claim to be a soldier or Spec Ops guy, I'm really not, but I am an experienced Airsofter who specialises in CQB and has trained with a PMC on a number of occasions to get better at building clearing and this game exactly replicates that experience. You got spotted by one guy for a split second? You bet your♥♥♥♥♥he shouted something and it chained all the way through the building so everyone heard it. Doorways are murderous, exactly as with airsoft and real life (They're called death funnels for a reason guys), and the fact that you die almost instantly and have very little ammo is exactly as it should be. Here's the thing: none of us gamers are trained soldiers. We like to think we are because we play stuff like Ghost Recon or Battlefield or even Arma, but we aren't and people claiming that this game is so unrealistic should really try going Urban Airsofting and see what it's like. Enough of that though, lets talk about good parts:-You have as much health as the enemy. One good burst and you're dead. That's awesome, that's fair and it teaches you to be damn slow and take your time like you should.- Your team are so damn important and so is communication. Your weapon won't be ideal for taking out everything at every range so you're reliant on allies and if you want to take something like a shotgun suppression isn't an option so again you rely on your team, which is great to see since so many games are too scared to make you useless in certain situations.- Enemy AI keep their eyes on their entrances. This is a basic principal of interior fighting and it's good to see that the Ai actually stick to it. If you lose one guy going through the door, you'll lose anyone who tries to follow him becuase the Ai will be aiming right at that door and has initiative, just as it should be.- No sticky cover system, if you want cover you find something solid and get behind it, no button doing ir for you. That's how I want my shooters to be.- Decent weapon customisation (Only one Shotgun which sucks though)- It's different. This game doesn't fit the ""Tactical Shooter"" genre that most people have created. It's a brutally realistic shooter whereby a single mistake kills you. None of this regening health, easy stealth nonesence that people associate with the genre nowerdays, just you, a gun and a building to clear. The simple hardcore nature is what defines this game.Cons:- You move slow as hell and it feels floaty, this is forgivable if you have patience but the lack of an ability to move quickly when needed is a pain.- There's only one shotgun, which sucks since they're so important in this kind of combat.- The Menus are a pain to navigate.- Allied Ai aren't smart, they'll open fire with unsuppressed weapons as soon as they spot a target.- Enemy Ai can feel rather Aimbot-like at times, and don't appear to be effected by recoil.- Certain things like placing charges can be clunky.So all in all, a damn good game that people seem to be put off from for all the wrong reasons. It's not for everyone, hell it's not for most people, but if you understand interior combat and how fast and brutal it truly is, this game is worth it. Unpolished, granted, but still a very realistic interpretation of building to building combat.			"

												Takedown plays like an alpha of an old Old OLD Rainbow 6 game.  Multiplayer for this game is dead online, I checked in on Rainbow 6 Vegas 2 and there were people online, alot actually so play that, get that.  Reloading is baffling in this game, if you have a full magazine and hit reload, for no reason your character will throw away the full magazine inserting a new magazine.  While the game uses a controller it seems the onscreen prompts are for a keyboard, unless controllers now have a spacebar.  In this game you die in one shot, ONE SHOT, see an enemy, ok then your dead, have fun with that.In real life, walk into another room and for no reason collapse on the ground and just lie there staring at the ceiling, congratulations you know what its like to play Takedown Red Sabre, since you will walk into a room and be shotteed dead before you can do anything about it.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												Where to start on this game.......well for starters, the game is poorly made by Serellan, a game company in Seatle. I see they try to fix this game up, they respond on the community and they give out free DLC. If they even fixed it, it would be really hard for them to bring back a crowd.So the gameplay is just over the top bad and funny. The AI are way too hard. They will instantly shot you, WITH THEIR BACK TURNED TO YOU! The only reason I say funny is because sometimes they ragdoll and its funny. Even though I didn't buy this game on launch, Serellan probably lost a lot of fans when they removed the Text to Speech function, which people made videos of and the are quite enjoyable. Wrong move Serellan.The graphics are perfectly fine since it runs on Unreal engine, but related to the engine are the gun reload animations and much more to anything with guns. The gun reload sounds are off from the reload animation itself so the reload sound will be done before the gun is.Overall, this game is REALLY bad and needs MAJOR work. Yet somethings aren't bad like the map designs, everything else such as AI, gun reloads, loadouts need some work. Yes, if they did fix ALL these problems, the game could make a comeback but, after all the press saying the game sucks, they'd have to pull a miracle out of their asses. So therefore I rate this game 5/10 not too good, not too bad. This is why I want a neutral button. PLUS ITS 1.50 RIGHT NOW!			"

If it were free, then i would have recommended it if you want to have a hardcore challenge with your friends. I bought it very cheap so i dont regret buying it because it can be fun but there just isnt enough content or quality for this game to cost money. It takes 20 minutes to see what the entire game has to offer so bare that in mind before buying.			"

												You know, it's not that bad... they've splatted a lot of bugs and the game, for a tactical shooter player like me, it's enjoyable. the enemies can no longer see you through walls, they no longer have eyes in the back of their head. They are actually believable in terms of difficulty. graphics aren't excellent, but really, if the game's good(which it is now), who gives a damn.it is very much a thinking person's shooter, if you play Arma at all, you'll fit pretty well into this I think, it's quite a decent CQB shooter, without the cheesy story nonsense you get in call of duty or battlefield. in short, it's a no nonsense shut up, get on with it shooter that people who play Arma, Rainbow Six or the original Ghost Recon will enjoy quite a bit.Klaus's hot tip #1:Get to know what slicing the pie is, you'll be needing to use the movement technique quite a lot in this game!Assume behind every wall there is someone with a firearm ready to blow your head into next year!Klaus's hot tip #2:Don't spend too long in one area, I did in the biolab on floor 2 searching for enemies, and my squad got overrun, as the enemy searched for me, if someone sees or hears you, double tap them before they can bring in reinforcements to outflank and outnumber you. If possible, shoot them in the back, before they even know you are there.			"

I think the game is tactical, methodical and realistic. One shot most of the time will take you down or your tango down. If you are into fast run and gun and churn and burn then you will not be satisfied with this game. It's methodical and requires patience and planning. To be honest, I was very hesitant on buying the game based on all the negative reviews. But, once it reached a dollar whatsoever it was hard to pass. And I'm so glad I did. I think there is a true gem here and it will only get better with more and more polishing. I know I'm going against the flow with a positive review. But, I'm really enjoying the game.			"

												Play this game and then you will realize what the 'strategy' means. I'd better call it 'Pro Evolution Shooter'. Sorry to hear that Flappy Bird has been removed from the online store. However, fortunately, we still have such type of splendid game on Steam. Why not develop a tablet version? It may be popular throughout the world!			"

												Takedown: Red Sabre, as a game, is THE worst game I have ever played. The shooting mechanics are awful, the AI are terrible and can kill you with just a pocket knife and a handful of raisins, the missions over no progression in things like weapons and player, the animations are bad, the control scheme is impractical, and (for a game that runs on the Unreal Engine 3) looks like a nintendo gameboy game.However, despite the game being broken in almost every way, it is one of THE most fun games I have ever played - especially played with friends. If this is ever on sale again, or is available for cheaper than normal price, I recommend you buy a copy for yourself and everyone on your friends list.For the game: 0/10For the experience with friends: 10/10			"

												""Steaming pile of garbage"" This game found a way to make movement feel like trash, the foot steps don't match to the speed you are moving. You sound like you are sprinting yet it feels like you are walking. The guns are pretty standard and the lighting is lack luster. The AI is predictable and boring, and customizing your loadout and armor stats feel pointless. Don't purchase, I feel cheated out of my $1.49.			"

												Soooo bad. Quick play just dont work, half of the servers impossible to join (due to connection issues). All other servers have the very same name. Players dont want to co-operate. Most of the time some kid just shoot all teammates at the very start and there is no way to punish him, just go to another server and hope he will not follow. There are tons of ergonomic problems but most of them not just because old game engine or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ net-code optimization - it just needs so much work before it can be interesting to play. No tactical elements spoted (even so i completed all tutorial and tried like 3 different maps for about 15 rounds total) - its just who will shoot accurate first (bots are weird too, but players - due to very bad net-code latency is wasting all eforts in tactics - you see someone come past you - you shoot like 7 bullets in his nech/head - he turns, shoots 3 bullets to you and bam - you won (this guy was the last one but he never fell or somehow showed any hits from your bullets).Even CS 1.6 more realistic than that - headshots animation and net-code are way better.My thoughts - *THIS* not even cost 1 buck i payed for it in steam. Want tactics - there is Americas army 3, want realistic Battlefield - Armed Assault 2/3. This game dont compete with anything, its just too bad overal and by any measure. I can see it as realistic CS 1.6 but the game engine too old even now, what time do developers need to optimise net-code, ergonomics and gameplay - i dont know, but we will have many better shooters in all aspects - cos we already have them.

It basically managed to take the boring/less exciting things from run and gun and stealth/tactic shooters, mix them together and give us... whatever this is.			"

												If you value your time and money, do NOT buy this game. Ever. Don't even think about it.I've been quite excited for the release of this game, so when it came out, I bought it right away. The idea of this game is everything I'm looking for in a modern First Person Shooter. But the execution... that's another story.The game feels clunky and unnatural. The very movement of your characters is like pushing a train up a hill with your bare hands. The gun mechanics and the general feeling of the firearms is like riding a bull for 8 seconds - they just don't do what you want them to do. It's like the controls are made with one reason only - to fight against you.I won't even mention the idiotic AI and the amount of bugs there were at release.So, long story short - the game was hyped by its devs way too much. They promised us things, which are completely possible and should actually be done in the gaming industry. Then they took their promises, stuffed them in a box with a padlock and gave as a disgusting abomination of a game, made for one purpose only - to milk some quick cash.			"

												At 1.49, I would recommend this game. At 14.99 it doesnt worth it. Grab it when its on sold otherwise you are throwing your money away. This game doesnt have that thing that will make you come over and over to succeed. You might have fun here and there but nothing that will last more than 10-15minutes. If you try to invite your friends well... I tried hundreds of times and never worked so they all gave up on the game.AI will spot you miles away and head shot you... sometimes the best way to clear a room is just to enter as rambo run and kill every one because if you take your time to really plan your entrance they will headshot you as you pass the door. Even if you crouch... cuz they knew you would do that you know...As I said... grab it at 1.49 if you want to try it because the Devs are still working hard on the game so it might become a good one! But for now it won't keep you in the game.Now its time for my 10-15minutes so Good Game guys!			"

												Honestly, this game is not that bad. I have a hobby of finding and playing bad games, and I can't honestly consider this game bad. In fact, there are plenty of games that received higher ratings than this that were considerably worse. I'd recommend paying around $5 to $7 for this game in its current state, if they fix some of the major bugs, it's easily a $20-$30 title.  Full disclosure: I did not back this on Kickstarter and paid just under $2 for it,  I'm not trying to make myself feel better about my money, I genuinely enjoy this game and have played plenty of worse games. I'd sincerely give Takedown a 68/100, it'll appeal largely to fans of tactical FPS games, but everyone else won't find it nearly as enjoyable.Alpha Prime, Alpha Protocol, Blacklight: TD, Chrome, Damnation, Judge Dredd: DvD, every Painkiller not by People Can Fly, Shellshock 2: BT, Star Wars: Republic Commando... These are all games that received much higher ratings, but I consider to be far worse than Takedown. This game's AI can be buggy, sometimes it's braindead, but when it chooses to work (and it usually does) it feels reminescent of Half-Life's AI. It will find cover, it will regroup and attack as a squad, and it will try to flank you. I'd argue that the AI for me works about 75% of the time, and I feel like people are remembering the times it craps out more than when it works. We're all so used to seeing good AI that when AI IS good, we don't even notice it anymore.The weapons are realistically modelled both in terms of visuals and ballistics. Rounds will penetrate materials properly, and this feature can be used both by the player and by the AI. Glass, thin boards, flimsy sheets of metal, etc. will be react to different kinds ammo the way these things would in real life. A large, slow caliber bullet will penetrate less than a small, fast round. AP ammo will go through more than FMJ or JHPs and Soft-Nose. Takedown has some of the best ballistics I've seen from a smaller budget game.The level design is above average, but not great. Levels have enough paths to take to reach an objective that they are in no way linear. However, the addition of doors with little ""No"" symbols hovering in front of them are a little perplexing. For being a realist tactical shooter, this breaks immersion. The maps could have had more depth, but aren't bad at all.Sound design is accurate for weapons, and even the suppressed weapons make the proper level of sound. Contrary to common belief, suppressed weapons are still fairly loud, just not AS loud. The weapons firing sound like real guns, not toys as I've heard in a lot of bad shooters. However, sound isn't properly blocked by walls, and it's possible to hear enemies in other rooms. Graphics are decent but a little dated. They feel sorta 2010-ish, which isn't that bad, tbh. Enemies are clones, but the fact that most wear balaclavas keeps the cloney-ness from breaking immersion. "

I would advise everyone to watch the trailers, read the reviews, and watch customer gameplay that you can find on YouTube. I'm calling ""recommended"" on this game, but only by a fraction. As this game stands, it's not worth buying it for it's retail price, but rather when it comes cheap. For $1.49, it's worth it. For $15.00, I wouldn't buy it.			"

Do you like AI that can either godmode you with aimbot quality aiming or stand like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around corners doing nothing? Do you like an abysmal selection of weapons and gadgets? Then clearly this game is for you.10/10			"

												Well,for 1.24 is kind of worth it...I bought this for me and a friend so 2 copies,and we were having some fun. Untill Russians started to invade our games because I couldn't find any server options anywhere like setting up a server with a password or ""friends only"" Any time I try to pick a class it always makes me use the first one so why have a choice if you are forcing me to use only one?I can't say that I mind the graphics,they are fine,I never really cared for graphics. This game feels like if it was never finished. Bare bones options,dubious A.I. Lack of missions...I hate the fact that I like the game. I would play more often if the server options problem would be fixed.			"

												The game itself isn't too bad, but on my first launch experience, it crashed after 6 minutes of play. The intermission after each map is somewhat confusing too -- seems you need to ""Exit Game"" to get to the main menu. While I have recommended the game in hopes that others do not experience the troubles I have, I was very hesitant between choosing 'Yes' from 'No'. I personally wouldn't recommend this to others, but I don't believe it deserves no recommendation at all.			"

												I can not recommend buying this game because this game is 100% free to play material. There is no reason for any one paying money for this game. If it were free, then i would have recommended it if you want to have a hardcore challenge with your friends. I bought it very cheap so i dont regret buying it because it can be fun but there just isnt enough content or quality for this game to cost money. It takes 20 minutes to see what the entire game has to offer so bare that in mind before buying.			"

												The game was all right, It kind of missed the mark of a FPS. It seemed to maybe get 30 frames per second, Upon completing a mission you where given a screen that said only 2 or 3 things. They where Restart or Loadout, There was no Good Job or any thing that poped up. I figured the game was progressive but I quess not, You automaticly have every gun and so on unlocked. There is really no goal forr the game aside from shoting people in the face, defusing bombs, hacking servers, and blowing stuff up. The level design also sucked, On every map I went on the map was like a puzzel. You had to remember exactly where you came from or your stuck in a room for an hour. Also on every mission including the training mission there is this stupid clock that counts down from an hour. It is pointless as the missions take at a max 30 minutes, If the timer hits 0, god only knows what will happen. In conclusion I do not recmend this game for anyone, You would be better of spedning your $1.50 on a pack of gum.			"

												I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews for this game. I'm absolutely loving the game. I am a big fan of the older Ghost Recon games and Rainbow Six Vegas 2. I think the game is tactical, methodical and realistic. One shot most of the time will take you down or your tango down. If you are into fast run and gun and churn and burn then you will not be satisfied with this game. It's methodical and requires patience and planning. To be honest, I was very hesitant on buying the game based on all the negative reviews. But, once it reached a dollar whatsoever it was hard to pass. And I'm so glad I did. I think there is a true gem here and it will only get better with more and more polishing. I know I'm going against the flow with a positive review. But, I'm really enjoying the game.			"

												Now, I haven't played too long, but I have played a lot of it. And What I mean is that I have been through the class set up, throught the tutorials, two missions and a multiplayer lobby. Now let me discuss the things that make this game good, and not just potential wise.The game's loadout set up is great, you have 4 classes (If I remember correctly). You can choose between about 10 or more guns, this includes variations on previous guns in the selection, maybe 1 or 2 types for 2 guns in primary. You can choose ammo type depending on class and gun, FMJ, FMJSS, and many more. there is atleast 4 sights to choose from on all weapons except shotguns and pistols.the secondary selection features I think 3 pistol types, and silenced versions of them. Teamwork is needed, unless in singleplayer, you must have some knowledge of the map or atleast use common sense to figure out how to complete a mission without dying, people do come up from behind but the game doesnt seem to spawn many enemies or any at all, this could be a bad thing.Realism is great, one to two shots or more depending on armor to die, which means you better act fast when you see an enemy, because they could spot you in no time and take you out first.Running can alert enemies in a big area, if you run from the start of missions, depending on where you select to enter and what mission you are on, you could alert the enemies.Leaning behind walls is a nice little feature in any gamecommunication is pretty straightforward if you are in singleplayer, you can tell the team to hold possition, be aggressive, be careful, defensive all  that jazz. The graphics aren't terrible, it's not crisis but its not siphon filter either.Now to the bad parts.movement speed - I don't really like moving slow in games, even if it could save my life. Which is why it's tempting to run, another reason its tempting to run is because most games don't really use sound other than gunfire as a huge factor in getting caught, now if you are near a room and you start stomping around and running it makes sense, but if you run a floor or two down, or atleast speed walk, you wouldnt get caught I dont think. thats kind of irrelavent though, anyways.Recoil - You can select guns that say they have low recoil, and it may be lower than others to choose from and even the other variations, you can put a silencer on it and use low recoil ammo types, but the gun's still have bad recoil.The accuracy for some guns is like shooting an inexpensive paintball guns, it just doesnt seem to hit people. So you have to be really good at predicting where to shoot from what distance and blah blah blah. WE ARMA NOW.Really I think that is about all that is bad and good in the game, its no't a bad buy. I got it on sale for 1.24, but its normally 5 dollars. I don't think it is really worth five, so get it on sale if you plan on buying it.I think the devs vision just didn't work the best, I like the game a lot, the idea of it is really good its like first person rainbow six or something. You just have to be a little patient to play it.also don't plan on playing much to any multiplayer because apparently nobody likes this game, but its not too bad6.5/10 for it being nearly a dead game, and it could also stand to be a little bigger with its modes, maps, and enemies.oh yeah, and you can edit your patch (like where you are from) and also I forgot to mention flashbangs, grenades, and breach charges... really nothing go into detail about but its not a bad game as I said before.thanks for reading if you did, this took me a bit to type but I'm sure if you play the game you will agree with me if you are open minded.

												Honestly, this game is not that bad. I have a hobby of finding and playing bad games, and I can't honestly consider this game bad. In fact, there are plenty of games that received higher ratings than this that were considerably worse. I'd recommend paying around $5 to $7 for this game in its current state, if they fix some of the major bugs, it's easily a $20-$30 title.  Full disclosure: I did not back this on Kickstarter and paid just under $2 for it,  I'm not trying to make myself feel better about my money, I genuinely enjoy this game and have played plenty of worse games. I'd sincerely give Takedown a 68/100, it'll appeal largely to fans of tactical FPS games, but everyone else won't find it nearly as enjoyable.Alpha Prime, Alpha Protocol, Blacklight: TD, Chrome, Damnation, Judge Dredd: DvD, every Painkiller not by People Can Fly, Shellshock 2: BT, Star Wars: Republic Commando... These are all games that received much higher ratings, but I consider to be far worse than Takedown. This game's AI can be buggy, sometimes it's braindead, but when it chooses to work (and it usually does) it feels reminescent of Half-Life's AI. It will find cover, it will regroup and attack as a squad, and it will try to flank you. I'd argue that the AI for me works about 75% of the time, and I feel like people are remembering the times it craps out more than when it works. We're all so used to seeing good AI that when AI IS good, we don't even notice it anymore.The weapons are realistically modelled both in terms of visuals and ballistics. Rounds will penetrate materials properly, and this feature can be used both by the player and by the AI. Glass, thin boards, flimsy sheets of metal, etc. will be react to different kinds ammo the way these things would in real life. A large, slow caliber bullet will penetrate less than a small, fast round. AP ammo will go through more than FMJ or JHPs and Soft-Nose. Takedown has some of the best ballistics I've seen from a smaller budget game.The level design is above average, but not great. Levels have enough paths to take to reach an objective that they are in no way linear. However, the addition of doors with little ""No"" symbols hovering in front of them are a little perplexing. For being a realist tactical shooter, this breaks immersion. The maps could have had more depth, but aren't bad at all.Sound design is accurate for weapons, and even the suppressed weapons make the proper level of sound. Contrary to common belief, suppressed weapons are still fairly loud, just not AS loud. The weapons firing sound like real guns, not toys as I've heard in a lot of bad shooters. However, sound isn't properly blocked by walls, and it's possible to hear enemies in other rooms. Graphics are decent but a little dated. They feel sorta 2010-ish, which isn't that bad, tbh. Enemies are clones, but the fact that most wear balaclavas keeps the cloney-ness from breaking immersion. "

												This is a good review because there are few and wont be very more good reviews of this game because:♥•The AI is pathetic. They run straigt to the wall... but they shoot you right in the face as soon as they have you at sight.☻The movement it's very bery veri beri bad, slow, difficult, unconfortable ♣ Multiplayer! Nobody is playing it... But they dont have why, right?  Even like that if you find a server you will be probably death before you start playing. Why? Dunno yetConclusion: Don´t buy it atlast you get the 0.99 price. Gift the extra copies and maybe you will have some fun with friends... Because friends are fun, right? If you don´t have fun friends or you don´t have friends at all. Don´t buy it, a taco is funnier, go get one.			"

												Punishes you for the bad habits you're taught by most shooters out there (runing in guns blazing), but is otherwise fair 80% of the time (as in you tend to fail when you or your team mates screw up,<like by not using a silencer when it is extreamly necisary>)Biggest problems; the menu interfaces need an overhaul, some kind of statistics record so you can better determine how you are doing, and most of all you need a well co-ordinated team.

												At 1.49, I would recommend this game. At 14.99 it doesnt worth it. Grab it when its on sold otherwise you are throwing your money away. This game doesnt have that thing that will make you come over and over to succeed. You might have fun here and there but nothing that will last more than 10-15minutes. If you try to invite your friends well... I tried hundreds of times and never worked so they all gave up on the game.AI will spot you miles away and head shot you... sometimes the best way to clear a room is just to enter as rambo run and kill every one because if you take your time to really plan your entrance they will headshot you as you pass the door. Even if you crouch... cuz they knew you would do that you know...As I said... grab it at 1.49 if you want to try it because the Devs are still working hard on the game so it might become a good one! But for now it won't keep you in the game.Now its time for my 10-15minutes so Good Game guys!			"

												<Positive Remarks>This game is not as bad as most reviews say. If you have 3 friends to play with who enjoy extrodinarily difficult games and this is on sale (I bought it here at $1.50) it can be worth it. However this is the only instance in which it can be fun. <Negative Remarks>Single player, this game is not worth your time even if it was free. I hate to label a game as being too difficult because I love good challenges, but this game is difficult for the wrong reasons. Mostly being your AI team mates and squad control. Both might as well be nonexistent. Aside from them getting shot faster than you will, they are too noisey. The best chance you have of knowing where tangos will be in this game is by sound and you squad will not stop running around and talking. The tangos seem as if they are running off an entirely different AI. They are hiding behind every door and around every corner. They are hiding in every nook and cranny on these maps. When you are spotted by an enemy you will most likely be shot. They have outstanding marksmanship and catlike reflexes. This would make a fun AI to play against if it was not this game.The controls are lacking refinment. By this I mean that it feels both sluggish and slippery and the same time. The game defaults you to walking (this can be switched to run in the gameplay setting of the options) and this makes for a very unpleasant first impression if you have not changed it to run. This causes gameplay to feel incredibly slow and uneventful. In defense of the game developers decision to make it a default, this game is not meant to be a run and gunner. This is a slow squad based tactical shooter.The last thing to talk about for faults for now is random tid-bits that just do not make any sense to me. First, when you pause the game you cannot view the controls or make any adjustments to mouse sensitivity. So hopefully you got it just the way you like it on the first try or you will have to quit the mission and jump back to the main menu. Second, door breaches are assigned to either weapon slot 3 or 4. Pressing numeric keys 3 or 4 (which ever you have breaches assigned to) does not equip them. You have to know they are assigned to ""G"". You are not told this, you just have to know by looking at the controls before you start playing the game. Call me old fashioned but I am use to tutorials teaching me everything I need to know when playing the game. This brings me to my final random frustration with the game: lack of tutorial. This is not my first rodeo, I know how to play first person shooters. This game has 2 practice maps but they both focus on how to shoot the guns and getting to look at all the cool effects from bullets hitting the wood or dummies. These maps feel as if they were just made to shoot the demo videos in pre-release.<Overall Remarks>This game was on sale for $1.50 for 2 copies so you can give one to a friend... Eh, worth it. I find it difficult to be unhappy about a game at that price. Word of warning though, this game contains VERY DIFFICULT SINGLE PLAYER. Due to terrible allied AI and sloppy control (this should not be the factor that makes a game difficult.)			"

												Over the years I've played computer games I've come across a few stinkers.  This isn't a stinker!  It has a slight air of unfinished about it, but it does seem to be ""work in progress"" and from looking at the forums, a labour of love.Don't expect the razamatazz and glitz of COD or MOH because there isn't any. No spectacular cut scenes,  However, in single player, every enemy soldier I came across took a shot at me whenever I came in to his line of sight.  My team went down very quickly and I was left to ""lone wolf"" it around the level.  It was tense, not knowing whether the next corner I looked around would be my last.  I enjoyed the opening doors in ""Biolab"" level, as in other levels most of them were already opened.When I had a team they were totally superfluous except when  they were the target of an enemy which meant I wasn't shot.  Do not follow the ""hide behind a team member"" method as bullets penetrate in this game, and your teammate is  more likely to get shot by you as they move erratically, with obvious consequences. ""Tactical Shooter"" it ain't.  You don't plan.  You don't command your team.  You don't set up ambushes.  It's more of a Strategic Shooter, go slow, peek every corner, hug the walls, hope you see them before they see you.I liked the graphics, and the oil rig and ship graphics were exceptional.  Sighting your shots without the obligatory ""onscreen"" cross hairs was refreshing and requires a bit of practice in the Range so you can pull off quick shots from the hip.  However aiming your weapon was consistent, and you soon get to know your gun.Perhaps a difficulty level system could be devised which gave rookies more armour to allow you to survive at least a couple of shots before you join the late and much lamented Tom Clancy?Technically it worked for me.  No crashes, no views through walls.  The sound is a little strange as your team announces that they have spotted an enemy or other useful information at the top of their voice, and hints at the fact that whether you use a suppressor or not makes no difference to the enemy AI.  Hearing a loud ""Tango sighted"" is also not much use if you don't know which team member sighted the aforesaid festive dance.Some of the levels are huge and hunting down the final terrorist can take ages; this can be described as either a) adding to the tension as the onscreen clock ticks away the seconds, ""Will you find him in time to complete the mission?"" or b) highly tedious and an issue that other games have overcome by making the last terrorist come looking for you.In summary it's cheap and merciless, a strange combination which harks back to a previous time when men were men and enemies stood up to be counted (and shot).  Without a single ""flashback"" or HD video the atmosphere of the game is tense and can all be over in a (muzzle) flash.  That's what makes it different  from the average FPS available today.I look forward to seeing more levels, or an SDK so that the people who have invested in the game can get a bit more return.If you like old school I think you might enjoy it, don't expect much, as there isn't a lot. But it is far from unplayable, and will be good for nostalgia trips on a low budget.			"

												This is an interesting game because it does something that hasn't been done in a while. It brings back the tactical shooter. My friends and I just got this because of the super low price and because we are very interested in teamwork and coop. This game looked like something we all really wanted. A welcome change from the run-n-gun FPS like COD or Battlefield. A game where you take your time, work together and keep your teammates safe.In some respects it delivers on the promise. In others it fails miserably.I will recommend this game at the *CURRENT* 90% off pricing.  I would not recommend it at any price above $9.99 in its current form.THE GOODCo-op mode that allows up to six players to work together to achieve the goals of the map.Large weapon/kit loadout selection.Weapon firing modes, weapon lean.Good, detailed maps.THE BADThe loadout system doesn't work in-game. We all tried to change our kits and weapon loadouts and every time we entered a co-op game we had the same loadout we started with. Very frustrating. This needs to be changed.The AI is really bad. Sometimes they have no idea you're right in front of them. In other instances they kill you first shot from long distance or immediately after they open a door.

												This is perhaps one the most flawed tactical shooters ever made. Not a single system present in the game works as intended, and in its hunt for ""realism"", all they have achieved is a cumbersome mess from which you can only derive entertainment by laughing at. It is, by and large, a painful game.I still recommend it though, since it is the best lesson in game design you will ever get; if you can pick this up for €2 or less, do so, and experience what it is like for a game to do everything wrong.

												This is an interesting game because it does something that hasn't been done in a while. It brings back the tactical shooter. My friends and I just got this because of the super low price and because we are very interested in teamwork and coop. This game looked like something we all really wanted. A welcome change from the run-n-gun FPS like COD or Battlefield. A game where you take your time, work together and keep your teammates safe.In some respects it delivers on the promise. In others it fails miserably.I will recommend this game at the *CURRENT* 90% off pricing.  I would not recommend it at any price above $9.99 in its current form.THE GOODCo-op mode that allows up to six players to work together to achieve the goals of the map.Large weapon/kit loadout selection.Weapon firing modes, weapon lean.Good, detailed maps.THE BADThe loadout system doesn't work in-game. We all tried to change our kits and weapon loadouts and every time we entered a co-op game we had the same loadout we started with. Very frustrating. This needs to be changed.The AI is really bad. Sometimes they have no idea you're right in front of them. In other instances they kill you first shot from long distance or immediately after they open a door. Sometimes if you just poke your head around a corner your instantly dead. The AI is just not realistic at all.The sound isn't as directional as it should be and in many instances just not correct. I've thrown grenades down a stairwell into a doorway and hardly even heard the muffled explosion.

												This game is only for the best of the best. I think if you are a very serious, hardcore gamer. You. Need. To. Buy. This. It is stupid-funny, if you shoot your team mates near doors their bodies will somehow magically just teleport into the door, and jam it up! But try that with all three of your mates, and then just off yourself because you're laughing way too hard from the chaos this game as made. Oh and there's so much, unique, genuine quality to this. It should be a Game Of The Year, a Trojan Warrior, and a Spartan, all because I say so. Now, who's ready to go out there and kill people because they can!?P.S. Don't forget to shoot two clips into the back of an enemy and only watch them turn around, and shoot you right in the face . This game, has made my life so much easier. I just need to shoot ANYBODY in the back with two clips, and they'll feel instantly better. Everybody. Should. Get. This. Game.Note to self: Take out the trash full of dead bodies after playing.			"

Graphics are terrible, even for an indie game. Game crashes quite often, Can't even run full 1080p without the game crashing. Gunplay is kind of realistic, I will give them that. Other than that, there are VERY few things about this ""simulator"" that are desirable. I will stick to ArmA, thanks.			"

												Get this game if you have friends and it's on sale. Otherwise, I wouldn't say it's going to be a fun and pleasant experience. This game is a little glitchy with the AI, classes don't matter, because weapons are shared. If you like hardcore games with all the odds against you, then maybe this game is for you. And playing alone, missions are almost impossible.			"

I tried to make my 4 loadouts as best as i could. Then, i tried, just tried to hop into multiplayer, with my internet connection fully working. Guess what, it told me that i wasn't connected. I tried to hop into singleplayer (thank god there is singleplayer) and went into a mission. The mission was fun and all that cool stuff, but the graphics were just disgusting, and the physics aswell. But for a 5 euros game,  i was expecting at least the multiplayer working. I wouldn't recoomend this game to people in search for a good FPS tactical game . This game is just not worth spending your money on. Thank god steam added refunding to the games.			"

												If you're looking for a modern tactical shooter... Look elsewhere, this is not it.It's not as bad as some of the other reviews make out... That's about the best I can say about it though, because in all fairness it's just not very good. It's just simply not good...It's a bit like playing the very first Rainbow Six game... Trouble is it looks like the very first Rainbow Six game, with less detail. Textures look like something from 15 or 20 years ago. Lighting is flat and lifeless. Shadows, what shadows?I can ignore bad graphics if the gameplay is good. Trouble is the gameplay in this is dull and uninspiring... Walk round a corner with Guy1, get shot in the head. Walk round the same corner with Guy2 and shoot the guy that shot Guy1, open a door and get shot in the head. Guy3 goes through the door, shoots the baddy that killed Guy2. A door across the corridor opens and Guy3 gets shot in the head. Guy4 meanwhile is stuck with his♥♥♥♥♥hanging out of a wall before the first corner. Because Guy4 is such a derp, he gets surrounded and then shot in the head...People go on about the AI being ""too hard"", yet I don't think they're as tough as the old school Rainbow Six AI... The AI can be punishing and difficult if your team make too much noise. It's the games one redeeming feature in my mind.When it's on sale at a £1 it's alright if you can get a couple of people together, but it wears thin quickly...TL/DR? If you're looking for a modern tactical shooter... Get Insurgency instead.			"

												i dont usually do reviews unless the game needs it, so if this changes your mind on buying it, good. I have had this game in my steam library for a while now, i havent played it a lot, but today me and my friend played it to get some footage for a video were making, i thought we wouldnt get good footage, but we had way more fun than expected, if you have a friend to play this with, its a lot of fun, if you play alone, its still enjoyable. the AI is very bad, sometimes it will instantly kill you, other times it will take a solid 10 seconds to kill you, but that makes them challenging and unpredictable, it requires extra caution to succeed. I ended up liking this game more than i thought i would because i actually gave it the time it needed to prove its self as a game you could have fun in. It may not be a good game, but it is fun. i hope this has convinced you to buy it, its only five dollars...			"

												So if you ignore the fact only a few people are ever on, ignore the fact that the enemy can kill you before they open the metal door, ignore the fact that half the time your own team can shoot you in the back at the spawn point, it's not a bad game. Granted there are like 40 enemies in one area, decent AI in tracking you down and flanking, but the reflexes of said AI are too high. Still kinda buggy with dying and then the door opens then you hear gunfire.			"

												Clearly this game isn't for everyone; and I think that was just what this game was about in the first place. This is a game for a player who still nowadays plays the first releases of Rainbow Six, Rogue Spear and Ghost Recon; a player who can forgive some AI inconsistencies, graphics and 'polishing details' and is looking for a tough, hard, challenging and (to some people) almost frustrating experience (just like R6 was). If you're this type of gamer, come on and grab a copy, you won't regret it!!...And of you're not, and you're looking for some brand AAA games, you should skip this one and save writing a bad review just for not understanding the concept and expecting something that it wasn't in the first place.

												Even tough it says i have played it for 0.7 hours online i played it around for 26 hours offline and i have to say i dont get why people hate this i had genuine fun and it was a flashback from my old rainbow six days. Its even better when you have a 4 man co op team to play with. I have sent this game to 3 of my other friends and they were not like ""oh i hate this is♥♥♥♥♥♥oh i go block you"" instead they thanked me for sending them the game and asked me if i want to play together. ofcourse its a bit difficult for the first time and AI might be stupid at some cases I still had fun about this game. If you not try to find its bad points its a good game. Just because people hated it everyone is searching for the stupid stuff that every other game has if you search for it. Keep up the good work Serralan and I had genuine fun that i didnt had from the ""inovative"" CoD or ""Realistic"" Battlefield.			"

												A friend gifted me a copy of this game and I feel like their hard earned money was terribly wasted. It reminds me a lot of my good ol' days playing Goldeneye on the Nintendo 64... minus the good days. The menus are crap, loadout customization flat out doesnt work, and the voice acting was a complete joke.This game does have merit though in one possible way. I could see people creating charity events, akin to Desert Bus, where you would get sponsors to donate to charity for how many hours you can consecutively play this without self-inflicting harm on yourself, or falling asleep inbetween rounds. It is in this regard that I would totally recommend this game to everyone! Think of all the people you could help... 11/10 Would choose Oddjob again!			"

												This game is by far the most revolutionary game to come out this year. With it's genre defining gameplay and graphics that would rival Avatar it is an extremly immersive experience. After only a several minutes of playing I gained a new repect for our police and protection services. The developers have obliviously worked their herts out to make this the best possible game it could be. You can really tell that they payed great attention to detail. For example, the death ragdolls look like they are from a Quentin Tarantino movie. Also the UI is completely ground breaking. It took only 15 minutes and 10 attempts for the game to save one of my classes. So overall this game is defintly one you should buy becuase you will be playing it for years to come.Watch out Cal of Duty and Battlefield, here comes Takedown Red Sabre!JK this game is garbage :)			"

												To be completely honest, unlike the rest of you I do not hate this game.I'm not saying there aren't reasons to hate this game. Oh no, not at all. Dumb AI, bland weapon choice, bland class choice, extremely low healthy, slow movement/aiming, the campaign isn't too fun,  occasionally devastating bugs and the wonky and sticky controls.But I want to focus on the good parts of this game.I can get past slow movement/aiming. I can get past wonky and sticky controls. I can get past all of that. Because it adds to the one amazingly fun thing this game has:Challenge.This game, it's hard. It's hard as ♥♥♥♥. It makes your rage at it. But, to me, it isn't a rage that speaks ""I hate this game, it is a load of crap and a waste of my money""... it screams, ""I hate this enemy. It isn't fair that they killed me so quick  and I want revenge!"" kind of rage instead. And once I can finally kill that enemy, it's one of the greatest and most satisfying feeling in the world. And, it's been a long long time since any game has given me that type of satisfaction.This game, purchased and gifted to me by my cousin as a joke, came to be a favorite of ours to play multiplayer together. It's fun to figure out the game, and be expecting of enemies and get further and further, it just adds to the excellent challenge and good times we're having playing it. Also, the occasional straddler accidentally joins our server and we all share some luls.And the luls, the luls will never die.I give it a generous 6.5/106 for the multiplayer and fun challenging atmosphere.5 for the luls.

												Absolute trash.The developers should be ashamed of themselves for peddling this garbage. Sadly, the main selling point of Takedown was a comparison with the Rainbow Six. This is a total lie, and the only similiarites these games share is that they both have guns. Takedown has ZERO planning, and ZERO control over your squad. You simply move from one corridor to the next, with your [worthless] AI following [and dying]Among other things, you get buggy gameplay, terrible UI, enemy AI that will instantly kill you the moment they see you, friendly AI that is absolutely worthless.

												In recent years, shooters have become homogenized. There used to be a wide range of different games to choose, from run-and-gun action titles to slow-paced tactical shooters focusing on strategy and tactics, but now most shooters follow the same model of big set pieces, regenerating health, linear levels, and cinematic experiences. The realistic tactical shooters with in-depth planning have almost entirely disappeared in recent years.This project, working title TAKEDOWN, aims to change that. This game, the spiritual successor to games like the original Rainbow Six and SWAT series, will focus on realistic weapons modeling, squad based play, in a close-quarters battle setting. To succeed in this game you need to take things slow, study your plans, and execute flawlessly. If you get shot, there are consequences. You wont be hiding behind a wall waiting for your health to regenerate. If a team member goes down, you will have to assess the situation and reallocate team members if necessary to complete the mission. Don't expect all of the tools and plans to be forced fed to you - it is up to the player to ensure their team is equipped and ready for the tasks at hand.AKEDOWN is a thinking-persons shooter. The player that takes things slow, aims carefully, and plans their moves right will overcome the player who runs in with guns blazing. Close-quarters battle brings the fight inside, as you would see SWAT teams or SOF units taking down small numbers of dangerous adversaries. Non-linear environments allow for multiple routes and tactics and add replayability. The operation to clear pirates from a hijacked oil tanker by Russian special forces in May of 2010 is a perfect example of the types of missions in TAKEDOWN.You will plan your insertions and routes before going into the scenario, outfitting your teammates with weapons and equipment of your choosing, and then execute the mission. If one of your team members is killed, they are gone, and you have lost their valuable experience, so you have to be careful! Gameplay modes include single player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer.If you are a fan of old school shooters where thinking meant more than running and gunning or perks, or if you are just looking for something different in your shooter games experience, this is the project for you			"

This is one of the least fun, broken and buggy pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever played with the A.I either not noticing you or killing you with one shot as soon as you enter the room.

												In recent years, shooters have become homogenized. There used to be a wide range of different games to choose, from run-and-gun action titles to slow-paced tactical shooters focusing on strategy and tactics, but now most shooters follow the same model of big set pieces, regenerating health, linear levels, and cinematic experiences. The realistic tactical shooters with in-depth planning have almost entirely disappeared in recent years.This project, working title TAKEDOWN, aims to change that. This game, the spiritual successor to games like the original Rainbow Six and SWAT series, will focus on realistic weapons modeling, squad based play, in a close-quarters battle setting. To succeed in this game you need to take things slow, study your plans, and execute flawlessly. If you get shot, there are consequences. You wont be hiding behind a wall waiting for your health to regenerate. If a team member goes down, you will have to assess the situation and reallocate team members if necessary to complete the mission. Don't expect all of the tools and plans to be forced fed to you - it is up to the player to ensure their team is equipped and ready for the tasks at hand.AKEDOWN is a thinking-persons shooter. The player that takes things slow, aims carefully, and plans their moves right will overcome the player who runs in with guns blazing. Close-quarters battle brings the fight inside, as you would see SWAT teams or SOF units taking down small numbers of dangerous adversaries. Non-linear environments allow for multiple routes and tactics and add replayability. The operation to clear pirates from a hijacked oil tanker by Russian special forces in May of 2010 is a perfect example of the types of missions in TAKEDOWN.You will plan your insertions and routes before going into the scenario, outfitting your teammates with weapons and equipment of your choosing, and then execute the mission. If one of your team members is killed, they are gone, and you have lost their valuable experience, so you have to be careful! Gameplay modes include single player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer.If you are a fan of old school shooters where thinking meant more than running and gunning or perks, or if you are just looking for something different in your shooter games experience, this is the project for you			"

												This game will give you cancer and kill your first born child before it is conceived. It will pillage your town, burn your system, steal your car and drown your cat. Seriously... you have an allergy to this game. Do not buy this game. Do not get this game for free. Do not take this game as a free gift. Do not look in the general direction of this game when it runs. You shall live a far better life following this sound advice.It's not even the kind of bad that's good enough for WTF gaming!* Warning: Steam though it would be a good idea to break all stereoscopic videos. Head to YT to watch it, make sure you are using Flash, not HTML5.			"

												First of all, I want to say that this game is HEAVELY underrated! It's extremely good if you play with people you know over voicechat through TeamSpeak for example. I wouldn't recommend playing it with random people because it seems that almost every single one of them thinks that this game is a killing fest like CoD or other shooter games and get themselves instantly killed. Then there are the trolls who think it's extremely funny killing teammates. I've only encountered a couple of insignifican bugs, like sometimes switching weapons being a little laggy or not being able to chose another class but the recon (this wasn't a problem though since you can totally customize every single loadout). And about the AI, let's say it took about 5 trys with a team of 4 people on a map we learned to beat the mission once with 2 players alive at the end (and we do have tactical shooter experience). What I'd like to see in the future are more maps and objectives, maybe with a little more depth to the missions  I'd say if you think that this is an interesting game but you are not sure if you want to buy it or not regarding the reviews, ignore them and check out some gameplay, you'll know if you will have fun playing it. Also make sure you have friends to play the game with :P			"

The devs banned me from the forums for posting my play time of 16 mins. That play time was actually being generous considering it was impossible to connect to servers due to their screw ups. They give lame excuses for their screw ups, like you can't connect to the 20+ servers they have because of QA testing. What a crock of bull! The devs are truly clueless, abusive and donr deserve our money.You have been WARNED! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!			"

												once i started playing this game I realized why so many people hated this game, and the answer is simple.... none of them are oper8r enough. You see this game here takes the most of any oper8r's oper8ing abilities. it requires stealth and tactics, being able to oper8 on the highest and most efficent level possible, and you see, most people who think that they are oper8r's cannot oper8 at such a capacity and therefore rage and call it a terriblke game but really this game is just to good for them.

												Many have said this game is hard, it's not hard, it's entertainingly broken. A friend and I were laughing at how absolutely insane the AI is for the enemy. They are either dumb as rocks or have the reaction time of The Flash. He and I are both good CSGO badge players, I grew up on shooters and it is literally impossible to get past some of these levels because you will get insta killed the second you open a door or round a corner. That said we still had fun for about an hour and a half, for this it gets a 5/10. It's so bad its good for awhile. The dev team has no interest in fixing the game so what you get is what you get and it clearly feels somewhere between alpha and beta.			"

But everyone seems to have forgotten how back in the day that was pretty much the characteristic of realistic military themed games.  I consider this game to be like a casualized version of the original Ghost Recon where you can have a beer and clear a few rooms before bed and not get all wrapped up in trying to preserve your advanced characters.NB Multiplayer doesn't seem to work at all.

												First of all, I want to say that this game is HEAVELY underrated! It's extremely good if you play with people you know over voicechat through TeamSpeak for example. I wouldn't recommend playing it with random people because it seems that almost every single one of them thinks that this game is a killing fest like CoD or other shooter games and get themselves instantly killed. Then there are the trolls who think it's extremely funny killing teammates. I've only encountered a couple of insignifican bugs, like sometimes switching weapons being a little laggy or not being able to chose another class but the recon (this wasn't a problem though since you can totally customize every single loadout).

												People really have to give this game some credit and stop comparing it to FPS games like COD. This game is in Alpha and i think it's pretty good..Yes a few bugs need to be fixed here and there but the game works it doesnt crash or anything. The AI is challening even if they are a bit stupid and seem like they no scope alot but there you it's alpha....AND it makes you think and not just run in like a idiot like you would on COD with regenerating health. This genre gets hated because people moan it's too hard...go back to COD where you magically heal and leave us proper FPS players to play good games and although this isn't the best of it's genre give it time it might be....

												once i started playing this game I realized why so many people hated this game, and the answer is simple.... none of them are oper8r enough. You see this game here takes the most of any oper8r's oper8ing abilities. it requires stealth and tactics, being able to oper8 on the highest and most efficent level possible, and you see, most people who think that they are oper8r's cannot oper8 at such a capacity and therefore rage and call it a terriblke game but really this game is just to good for them.

												First of all, I want to say that this game is HEAVELY underrated! It's extremely good if you play with people you know over voicechat through TeamSpeak for example. I wouldn't recommend playing it with random people because it seems that almost every single one of them thinks that this game is a killing fest like CoD or other shooter games and get themselves instantly killed. Then there are the trolls who think it's extremely funny killing teammates.

												I still think that this is quite a good game however it was dissappointing. The game is quite difficult but after a while you get used to the hard gameplay. Having your AI teamates is pretty useless, the only reason they're there is because you get to control them after your main character dies. The visual quality of the game is bad for a game that was released in 2014. I feel like the game game could've been improved by giving you the option to command the AI teamates where to go, like in Rainbow 6 or SWAT 4. The reasons I'm recommending this game is because it's a challenge unlike the majority of FPS games today which also makes it different from the rest. the other reason is that it's very cheap but I guess that's for a reason.

												Let's start with ""Who SHOULD NOT buy this game""....     1) CoD arcade style run and gunners.. This is not a game for you   2) Inpatiant people who just get mad at slow AI progress...This game forces you to think out your plan of attack, and is set up to make sure you really feel like your in a close quarters battle. One well placed shot and your dead.. thats life. Stand out in the open, and your asking to be lit up.. If it looks like a choke point... you might want to think twice or throw in a flash bang before going through. Other words, this is a TACTICAL shooter. The gameplay is smooth. It could be much better, but what game is perfect? Sound effects seem good so far.  The weapons selection is fairly decent, but the equipment is fairly limited.   Graphics could be stronger, but are fair for the base engine the game runs on. The AI.... lets see, the big problem I have is having to constently repeat orders to my team... The Enemy seems to be ready for you if you don't flank and sneak correctly. Graphics: 7 Sound: 7Gameplay: 6.5Difficulty: 9My personal opinion on Fun Factor: 9 "

												This game has me completly puzzled as to what the devs were aiming at... The options both for video and audio are very limited, you are only allowed to save ONE out of FOUR loadouts as I could not get it to save anything else. The gameplay itself is leaving much to be desirable, If you want to go with a realistic feel from a game this is not the one... The enemy are capable of having X-Ray vision and will headshot you in the 2 seconds you are in their sight-line which is very encompassing. You can still play with friends and makes for good rage quits but, don't plan on having your lobby locked in any way or form, there in no way to lock your lobby therefore, other people will join and troll the living daylights out of you... This game looked a lot better in the beta which of course on the release day they screwed it up pretty badly.			"

												I feel very sad that development on this game seems to have died out - because I found it really intense and enjoyable despite the bugs. I can't recommend this anymore because development seems to have stopped, I doubt there's a community left, and lots of bugs remain unfixed as far as I know.Tear of sadness...			"
