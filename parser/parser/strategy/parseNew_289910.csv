												Good game but it would be fun if the game had some sort of Creative Mode with unlimited money.			"

												Not really a tycoon game. It's just about building ropes and buying hotels. Unfortunately there is no intelligent business or economics mechanic behind. You can't even see the profit of a hotel or single rope and optimize your business. Furthermore there isn't any chance to influence the amount of visitors in your area. This leads to huge and expensive rope construction that nobody uses.Overall impression: ok, but neither entertaining nor realistic.			"

												Sounding akwardly random, Ropeway Simulator is surprisingly enjoyable despite being described as a niche product. The most important features such as the construction and placement of the ropeways and stations themselves, as well as the economical bussiness management are well polished and offer decent gameplay for your money.It does limit itself in overall content but if you're a fan of the genre you won't be dissapointed!Ropeway Simulator earns a 7/10

			Conceptual perception of random themes for games, and in this case simulators, is fitting for Ropeway Simulator 2014. Putting that aside, is this simulator what you're looking for?

												Ropeway Simulator 2014Interesting Concept - on inital thoughts I assumed it was going to be another lame let down, but it is not half bad. THe graphics are acceptable (not brillant, but good.)Cons- Very tedious. Building the ropeways is hard as the angles have to be perfect.- Very basic tutorial system.- Limited Ropeway locations, you cant just build one, it can only go in the spaces the game allocates.Pros- If you like tedious projects, this one's for you.Its a good game, the idea is there. I lost my desire to keep playing after 30 minutes trying to just build one ropeway, by readjusting tower heights and base angles.7/10.			"

												Not that bad game at all, but few thinks can be find everywhere. For example is smally unrealistic ammount of pylons sometimes (It can happen that you need to build only one pylon and ropeway is complete). But if you ever wanted to be a ropeway builder it´s game for you.+ Big ammount of ropeway types from chairlift to funiculars or cargolifts, you can ever choose from.+ Summer and winter scenario.+ Many areas where to build.+ You can set many things from gondola ammount, color, lift speed...- Sometimes too easy. - Zooming on hotels or ropeways bases is after 20 minutes of playing really boring.

												I greatly disliked this game, and it didn't stay downloaded for long.I'm all for niche games, and usually find them quite amusing. However, I just really could not get into this game. It's not so much a simulation game, but more of a puzzle... There is hardly any freedom to create as you wish, but instead you're set with the task of trying to evenly space-out support poles over a distance that I can't even adapt. "

												God this game is just awful for starters it lacks key mapping which is a real pain then to add to the insult every time I went to play it the game would bug out and freeze the time it took me restarting the game five times before I figured out it was the tutorial freezing the game and not unlocking it. As for the gameplay it has a good chance of being a nice management game but just drops the ball. While the game is rather basic and can be picked up and played it has a very narrow gap of content and the tutorial is very lacking it more or less points to a button and tells you what you can clearly figure out on your own. While I did play this for a little made a few lifts which was rather annoying even more so from the lack of a quick build was just how picky the system was to the point of where it became more annoying to adjust it then it did to just spend more money for a few extra poles.I came into the game hoping I would like it because it sounded like something of interest but in the end you more or less point and click. You could play this game without a keyboard so long as you have a mouse with a scroll wheel. That being said I dont think its worth the asking price and even now with it being on sale for 2 bucks I would be kind of insulted I paid for it.			"

												First time takes a long time to start without being configured to run on the proper GPU. Exit and configured to run on Radeon HD 6770m; starts way faster BUT takes too long to exit. Nearly thought that on both instances it hunged to black screen.Seems to run fine with good frame rates.Detailed review to added later.			"

												This is a boring waste of money. Nothing interesting ever happens, and you can never complete a single track because you need to add more towers -5 feet away from the last!
