												If you looked at the screenshots for this game and though to yourself ""This honestly looks like a hastily thrown together mess."" well congratulations: Your eyesight has not failed you.Using art assets from the earlier flop 'Spaceforce Captains', this game manages to be even worse by taking away what little freedom the player had. While Spaceforce Captains was a buggy and badly thought out 'in space!' take on the Heroes of Might and Magic series (not just a game set in the same genre, but literally HoMM4 with the serial numbers philed off and set in space), this game doesn't rip off any specific pre-existing games and still fails to do anything new or original.If you do still feel tempted to buy and play this, allow me to give you a preview of what your experience will be like: Use abilities (which are all name in german, because proper translation would've required effort and nothing in this game has any effort behind it) to kill enemy, play minigame to recoup resources expended on abilities, rinse, repeat ad nauseam.In short: Avoid this like the plague.

												This game doesn't have much depth to it and isn't worth the steep learning curve. There are no customizable gameplay settings and it has no instructions beyond a simple vague UI tutorial.			"

												Huh. I didn't think I could go wrong with a $10 game. I was wrong. The game is so simple, it's not worth playing.			"

												This is a game that needs far more customization, there seems to be a decent size pool of ships but only gives you access to just a few (like maybe 6 total). With no option to learn new technology, upgrade your ships or explore the galaxy in a non-linear fashion this game is lacking in any sort of depths.It seems to clock in around 4 hours of gameplay and with no real options to mange your fleet could not recommend getting this unless it's cheaper.

												This game has a feel it was developed as a concept but was not fleshed out.  It is missing the typical tutorial to get you started with the game.  Also missing much of the mechanics to make this an enjoyable experience.  I donated to this charity but will not in the future.			"

												I've discovered that spending $10 dollars on a Starbucks latte and a pack of chicken nuggets provides an experience which is more entertaining and more satisfying than this game.  On the surface, the concept of this game looks good. Turn-based space combat...what can go wrong?The reality is that the gameplay is extremely repetitive, with no customization, no real strategy, no tactical options, and no depth whatsoever. The concepts employed here would make for a solid hex-style board game, but for a video game, they fall painfully flat. There is no tutorial of any kind to introduce the player to the game-world (leaving the player immediately immersed in a two-dimensional unbranded universe), with the occasionally commentary scene provided as pure filler. The little snippets of story mean absolutely nothing in the experience of gameplay. ....Getting down to the mechanics, under this thin veneer of a unique game-universe... The regular combat structure lacks any imagination, with just three basic combat techniques (lasers, missles, and AoE missiles) and a handful of special options. The mini-game required to aquire the crystals used for the special attacks grow old fast and are not worth the time or effort. The mothership battle card-based minigame is completely random and a defeat doesn't actually end the game---It really doesn't make much sense.... nor does the ""search for life"" mini-game, which has the same mechanics as the crystal hunting mini-game and no impact on the game itself. All of the mechanics of these gameplay elements are filler-pieces. I've been very disappointed by PC sci-fi games in general... for the past 18 months, high-end ""finished projects"" were released in less-than-beta state (i.e. Sword of the Stars II---which to K and his team, was meticulously repaired and improved over the course of the following year), not to mention the painfully incomplete Legends of Pegasus, which set a new low for sci-fi titles (and bankrupted the studio which produced it). Spaceforce Constellations, sadly, is clearly a complete product (unlike the other aforementioned bombs), and it does actually work---no bugs, no hangups, no crashes, no leaks... but the complete product is a mono-dimensional waste of time---and in full 1920 HD, the combat scenes looks terrible. As another commenter suggested, if this game were to be flushed extensively with variety----ship design options, ship equipment options to change both ship aesthetics and functional load-outs, a research tree to develop new equipment with which to customize those ships, and actual decision-moments in the game to shape the direction and outcome of this incredibly generic story (i.e. developing alliances with multiple plot-directions), perhaps this could be evolved into an experience worth playing. Such advancements would require a lot of effort and still might not be worth the price of a latte and chicken nuggets, unless the constellation-filler became more substantial than the mechanically separated chicken preferred by McDonalds for their tastey treats.(If this developer has any sense, they would slim the game down and release it for free as a flash game. On the other hand, I've played better flash games than this.)			"

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/263800		

an rpg with space ships and 3 alien races to fight.the walkabout map consists of a light and dark green paths, the dark green paths just lead to battles and resource gathering nodes but the light green will lead you onward.there are also space stations on the light green path here you can craft 2 different color crystals to make 1 of the 3rd, change your crystal draining weapons, or replace your spaceships.as you win battles you'll get xp and your general will gain levels that will let you control more ships (max 6), unlock more crystal weapons (take 4 out of 12 into combat), & space ships (5 in all) it also increases the base level of a ship added to the party.the game has 3 modes of play1)hot or cold: once you own a space you can drill for crystals or look for life (as you find life you'll be given more crystals. info is in a chart on the right in the gathering screen) by clicking the green half circle (crystal) or microscope (life) on the bottom .here you'll have a grid and you'll need to find a crystal or life source within a limited number of clicks but each has 3 color indicators to show you how close you are: red is ""cold"", light green (crystal) or orange (life) is ""warmer"", and bright green (crystal) or yellow (life) is ""hot"" and you only get ""hot"" spaces up to 2 spaces from the source. 2)fighting: when you land on a space with another ship you can fight or retreat (go back). in here each ship take turns attacking with 1 main attack based on the ship (lasers can not attack through another ship but missiles can hit from anywhere ) or you can use 1 of the crystal abilities in the bottom left but each will use up a set color and number of your crystals.other commands on the top right are (shield) defend, (flag) retreat, (arrow going in a circle) turn on/off the rotating screen, (grid) show/hide grid, you can also click the map and move it around or zoom in/out with the scroll wheel. you win buy taking out all opposing ships and any surviving unit will get xp so they can become stronger than replacement ships.if you have at lest 1 unit left you can replace ships at a space station.you and the opponents ships are based on 5 different units just reskinned for you and each of the 3 alien races and they are: the interceptor (fast, less shields, but accurate and uses a twin laser), fighter (more hp, and uses a laser), valkyrie (less hp, but uses missiles), restorer (lowest hp, but heals), destroyer (missiles that hit all enemies units).3)space station battles: after you win a fight on a space station and every so often you'll be attack by an alien space station.this plays out as a card fight where your given 4 cards to pick from and a dice (it will replace all cards) also on the left you can see what your opponent will play.you pick 1 card each turn as you try to take out the opponents shields and armor and try to keep yours up.each card has a action (what happens to the opponent) & a consequence (what happens to you) and they range from nothing, +/- shields, +/- armor, damage (- both), & repair (+ both).once shields are lost any more shield damage will go to the armor and once all armor is lost the space station is no more.

												To be honest I thought the game would have more to it. Way too much combat. It wasnt what I thought it would be.Thought there would be more research,weapons,ships etc.The game is pretty much a kill fest and no thinking.The graphics are good,sound is good but play wise not so good.If the game was more than $9.99 I would of asked for a refund,sorry :(			"

												I have seen flash games that are executed better, that I can play for free mind you, than this, I dare say this would be one game that I would say steam should just remove from it's archives and refund everyone who bought it.There are free games on here that are far more engaging than this could be on its best day, much less how it actually is, STEER CLEAR OF THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS, it's a pathetic excuse for a game, and gives the industry a bad name.

												I think if you can get get the game on sale for less than 2 dollars it is probably worth it, but for 9 dollars it is definitely not. There is a game here, it is though very much like some solo boardgame in which it feels hard to lose, you just have to grind away. I like the concept of having to try ones luck at find resources at each not - it is kind of a bingo/minesweeper game . The mothership battles are interesting, moreso than the ship to ship engagements, but they have some strategy as you get further along and more tactical options open up. It is a fairly lite lite strategy game though, so wait till it is on sale i suggest			"
