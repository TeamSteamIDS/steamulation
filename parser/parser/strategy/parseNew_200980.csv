												The world to explore is huge, non linear for the most part. Expect to die many times, the game is challenging and I like it this way. Expect to read too, and I mean read a lot. Geneforge is a well-written story heavy RPG where your choices will matter, with diplomatic situations filled with gray areas (it's not at all your classic good vs evil scenario), tactical turn-based combat, several different ways to play the game (I choosed a solo Agent, but you might as well play a Shaper with an army of creations), I think there are 5 different ways to ""win"" the game and complete the story.I did not enjoy the story as much as the first game of this saga because the moral choices and the diplomacy were not as entertaining in my opinion, but they were far from being weak! Probably because of some similarities with Geneforge 1, it lacked the surprise and excitement to discover more about the whole plot. The first few maps were rather boring and linear, so it took me some time to get into the story. However areas turned out to be much more balanced than Geneforge 1 and the hand holding of the first maps didn't last long. At some point I became addicted and put some other games aside in order to see where the Geneforge 2 story was going to bring me.If you are able to disregard the basic graphical quality when playing a game offering a rich world, deep story and a challenging yet enjoyable gameplay, the Geneforge saga and Spiderweb games in general are meant for you and will give you a great gaming experience, you should not hesitate to give them a try. Otherwise, I cannot recommend these games to you.My rate: 8/10, I'm looking forward to play Geneforge 3 to 5.			"

												An amazing game, far more playable than the first game, and actually more playable than the third.  If you like top down RPGs like Baldurs Gate, Geneforge is the game series for you.			"

												Despite what the negative review said, it worked perfectly fine on my computer.I have a Samsung office model that is about 2-3 years old and it runs fine on my computer.It's not as good as the first game in my opinion, but it is still worth playing! I would buy the bundle to get all 5 games for the price of one!			"

												A game along the lines of a Spiderweb title always contains a vast, vast, amount of content in terms of story, lore, conversation, etc. It's essentially like writing an entire interactive novel...three or four times, because there are always multiple endings based on your actions. Even if an action might have seemed insignificant at the time, you can bet you will feel it later on. Choosing from a handful of factions means choosing from a host of significantly different plot lines. Every named character you kill, you could have had a conversation and an alliance with.This level of detail and development is pretty uncommon. You have to find titles like Bastion and Transistor in order to match the level of depth that comes from a game with the screenshots that make it look little more than an arcade game. Even then, the story is pretty linear. When we start up a Geneforge game, this diverse gameplay options inside a rich and immersive environment is what we are looking for. Fortunately, it's what we get; Geneforge 2 happens to be my favorite out of the series and one of the primary games that I grew up with. If Steam was able to record how much I played this game when it first came out, it would be over 500 hours. And since the story is just as good today as it was then, I see no reason why someone couldn't get half that time without even noticing.			"

												Turn based combat RPG, sequel to Geneforge 1.  I like the story and the way the setting works in this one, and they've cut down slightly (though only slightly) on turrets and mines.  There are some good horrific abuses of power in this one, to the point where I actually killed off a non-hostile NPC just to make him stop making sentient explosives.  There are five-ish factions this time; the Awakened, the Takers, two new Shaper-led factions, and the unspoken option to remain loyal to your masters and just kill everybody.  I like the mentor figure Shanti, and how her story and the investigations structure the game.Reasonably solid sequel, that builds on where the last one left off.  My only frustration is the locked door in the northwest corner of the northwest everything that I could not open.  Can it be opened?First time players, I highly suggest NOT choosing any faction until you have been to every nonhostile city in the game.			"

												..who picks a class which partitions his skill sets based on cost. It remains possible for any class to purchase any skill but variable skill costs are in general dissuasive. Each of the three classes represents a different approach and contributes to the overall replay ability. There also appears to me at least one major choice (GF 1) via a factional alignment that is mediated by dialogue choices over time. The slow-burn story and exploration of the culture of various factions within the game is also much as it was in Exile, as is fairly sizeable amount of gameplay and world. Geneforge has, however, created a rather distinctive setting surrounding an Academy of Biomages and their creations, sentient or otherwise, on an abandoned island you become stranded on. The difficulty curve is accommodating for those familiar RPGs, short of jumping straight to the hardest difficulty and/or punching through into distant territory. Fun, intricate and as charming as talking magical giant spiders.			"

												Let me start by saying I love Geneforge 1. That said, this is not as good as Geneforge 1. This is for the simple reason that while playing geneforge 1, everything was a mystery. Playing Geneforge 2, the player has so much more information than the character he or she is playing. This hurts a lot when you're playing a story driven game.Pros:Still good story writingMultiple endingsRewarding multiple playstylesLeveling system (same as geneforge 1)You get pet raptors and bigfootsLots of play time for your buckEnjoyable combat system that allows for a lot of strategies.More factions available than in 1Cons:not as good as geneforge 1Opening music is bad and overall the game could use a better soundtrackIt can be difficult to tell what area you should be safe to progress to until you're dead.TLDR; not as good as 1 but still worth a play through.P.S. a note about the publisher I once bought the first game when realarcade was a thing (back in the early 2000s). Back then they sent a disk and an authentication Code. Well forward to around 2011ish, new computer and i lost the code. I emailed them saying I bought the game years ago and asked for another code. They sent me a new authentication code within 24 hours with no additional questions, maybe they had my email on file idk. But that's the kind of publisher i want to support. Thanks Spiderweb Software			"

												Geneforge 2 is more of the same from Spiderweb (almost literally, since it uses the same engine from Geneforge 1). The story is just as excellent, and your ability to interact with it and pick any road you choose is unchanged. One big thing to remember if you're starting Gen2 after Gen1: none of the endings are canon. Strictly. There's one ending to Geneforge One that's roughly canon, but even then, there are some differences that do make it its own thing. This is a trend for the series as a whole, actually, with the story progressing, but never quite as you thought it would.Anyway, TL;DR: Play it. It's great. Spend all your ability points in Parry. Be a god.			"

												Geneforge 2, the first Geneforge game I played. The mystery and unique world caught my eight year old self off guard. I wasn't sure what I expected but it sure wasn't this. I absolutely loved it, though. The intrigue and politics flew right over my head. All I knew was that I had to find Barzahl. Now that I understood the true magitude of the complex plotline, I really started to enjoy the game. When I first discovered the depressing fate of my poor mentor, I was crushed. I despised Barzahl for what he had done to me and wished for revenge. Unfortunately, I think I died. A lot. Then again, everyone dies in Geneforge. Overall, it's a great game. Get it, please. You won't regret it, hopefully.			"

												The best game in an already amazing Saga. Sad that the series went downhill from here. Starts off a bit slow, story-wise, but once you get into the flow, it's fantastic. If you want to play a Guardian, this is the game to do it in, with the introduction of the Parry skill, they can become incredibly tanky. It got nerfed pretty hard in subsequent games though. This game is also notable for having the best xp system in the series, with the scaling being very sharp in the first sections (to reward and incentivize players to keep moving forward, and actually following it's own mantra of ""you don't have to clear every area in the game""), but as you get farther in, it becomes significantly more relaxed, so that you never have a situation where endgame enemies are giving you 1 xp and you become stuck. Also, this is the last game in the series to give xp for spawned enemies, so while there are actually very few spawners outside of certain regions for story reasons, they never feel like a chore, in sharp contrast to the third game which absolutely beats you over the head with them and gives no reward beyond the opporunity to fight more spawners in the next area.

												I have never written a review on here, but considering this is one of the best games and one of the most underated games ive ever played, ive decided to try my hand at it. Starting off, i know it may say i only have a couple hours on record with the game, but id like to stamp that out now. I played this game years back off an old game engine before steam was a thing, buying it again now is more comfort and support for me, like buying an old book that you read years ago. I have well over 200 hours in the game, and about a thousand in the series. So let me dive in, and let you know what this game is about.   Geneforge is more than a game, its a book, an experiance, a choice, and a beautiful combat system all in one. It cries out to the imaginiative, the 3 am readers, the DnD players, the indie game searchers. What it lacks in graphics, it makes up 10 fold in story. The game puts you in the middle of an entire world and has you influence the outcome of it. In the first game, you find yourself in this estranged world, where the game gives you a brief history of it, then immediately tears that away. It isolates you, shows you that you must survive, and asks you what to do to survive. But that is only the first part. once you gather your bearings, you have to forge a path. At first the paths seem clear, good or evil, but the more you progress the more you realize there is no good. there is no evil. This game makes you question everything, with the only clear progression being that of power. You single handedly experiance the start of a world rebellion, and reitre as a god or a soldier by the end. The same picks up in each consquensial title later on, each putting you, a young shaper, smack dab in the middle of the biggest points in history of this new world. The hours, weeks, months of text painstakingly put into this game alone makes it a solid game, but the combat is fantastic too. You play a tactics style turn based micromanaging comabt system, sort of like fallout: tactics or final fantasy: tactics. But instead of pre determined abilities, like everything else you determine your path. Conjure up an army to fight for you, use magic and objects to trick your opponets and take them out one by one, or don a helmet and sword and slash your way through hoards, the choice is yous. My by far favorite part of it however, has to be the fact that nothing is safe in this game from you. It emphasizes that your choices can change the entire reality. No npc cannot be killed, although it may be hard. The world will form to what you want it to, if you are brave enough to undergo the task. Dont take this as you cannot lose, for the wrong desicion will put you in a spot where you cannot escape. But understand that you are free to make that deicion, you are free to make any desicion. This is the closest i have ever come to DnD Freeplay. Pro's: Excellent story line, worth of a novel of the highest value.          Freerealm as hell, you are free to make any desicion you want, nothing stops you, you shape the future and history alike.            LOTS and LOTS of content, as said earlieri  have over 1000 hours in the series as a whole. thats a lot for a single player non grind game.          Decent combat tactics system, many ways to play out combat.          Can easily engulf you in for weeks.          Lots and Lots of TextCon's: The graphics are subpar at best, must be able to use your imagination            Game doesnt hold your hand at all, in fact quiet the opposite. This may be a con or pro.           Again, a LOT of text. again, could be a con or pro depending on your preferance.Overall i would rate this game a 9/10, Despite the horrid graphics. i honestly believe that if ther were better graphics, there wouldnt be enough reasources to make everything else so amazing. Heres to you, Spiderweb Software.			"
