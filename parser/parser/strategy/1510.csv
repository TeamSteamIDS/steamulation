												Finally after years of training online and offline, Hours of guides, Hours of grinding, Suffering. Regret always in the back of my mind for the time wasted on this. It has officially happened. I am a master hacker. Rushing through the logs deleting with the percision of a scalpel, never wasting a moment dedicated to filling my billion dollar bank account with more money. Trying to simulate the initial rush of robbing a bank. I rush in with a bounce network all around the world starting with InterNIC. I quickly start up my timer and turn on the proxy and firewall Disable tools. Brute force but neccesary for speed. It shuts off and I run the admin account I had stolen from early contacts. I'm in I copy all the accounts down, I find the prize i'm looking for. Killian Hoyal, a 967 million dollar account, a legend hidden inside of my personal gameworld. It had taken years of searching and doing favors to gain the proper knowledge to find this account. Quickly I delete disconnect from the server and rush into my log database at InterNIC, deleting all traces of my connection. Yes, I had finally found everything I would need to stage the largest bank robbery in the history of the world. From the comfort of my home. I go and make an anonymous bank account under a pseudonym. The bank is small so it wouldn't be a high priority target to search if the FBI caught onto my trail. Finally I take a deep breath, 4 minutes 11 seconds says my timer. Wasting no time I quickly connect to the bank where Killian Hoyals money is kept. Running bypasses, disablers, and all manners of illicit software designed to slow down any one looking for me, and to make sure I don't leave a trace. I log into his account using the details I found from the admin account. I go into transfer funds and make the trade to my bank account in Monrovia, Liberia. The transfer goes through. I go into his transaction logs and edit the log showing the money was sent to another hackers that had previously done me harm earlier on. I disconnect and reconnect to my account in Liberia. The money is there, perfect. I go into my transaction logs and delete the log showing the money recieved. Almost done, I connect to my home bounce and log into the logs. I delete the log showing me connecting to the banks in the first place. Just like that, his money is mine with no trace to be found of it. A job well done, I am officially. A master hacker.			"

												Set in the ""future"" of 2010 (Yep, that old) you play as an Uplink Agent. It starts with you ""connecting"" to the Uplink Servers to create your new hacker identity. After a fake-but-believable-ish ""boot up"" you are directly connected to your remote proxy gateway, and ready for some plausibly deniable crime. This isn't real hacking, but the way the game presents itself you don't need too much imagination or suspend too much disbelief to leave an exciting doubt in the back of your mind. Easily the most immersive game I have ever experienced.The game is completely open-ended and very complex, but approachable (There is even an in-game IRC that connects you to a real-life Uplink chatroom to talk to others in the game, if someone happens to be on it at the time.). It gives you an optional, basic tutorial risk-free on one of the Uplink Corporation's testing servers, and there are further tutorials on Uplink's main server, but after that you are left to your own ingenuity. That's a common, repeating theme of this game. Experiment, have some fun. You hacked into the social security database for your last job, what about doing it again to mark yourself as ""deceased"" to really become a ghost, or hack the criminal records database and put a warrant for arrest out on a server admin that made things difficult for you. In fact, the only way to ""beat"" this game, is to ""break"" it. You won't find any ""questlines"" or the like until you are experienced enough think a bit outside your usual targets...One of the few games that makes missions non-linear, simply because these aren't missions, they are contracts. A deal between you and an anonymous individual working on behalf of a random company. You can go ahead and tell your employer ""Nope, not in the mood, have someone else do it."" after you accept the contract... for half the pay up front! (Although, good luck getting another job if your reputation is too spotty!) Perhaps someone paid you to give the guy an A, and on a whim (and after your paycheck), you put his ""D-"" right back. What about this investigation of corporate corruption? You have it all tied up, got your pay and everyone is happy. But you still have access to the thief's account, and for a short window of time, it's still filled to the brim with your employer's siphoned money. Backstab at your leisure(and peril), none of it's scripted.On the negative side, if you look at the screenshots, that's pretty much how the game looks. You can install themes to change up the color scheme if the sharp black+blue hurts your eyes, or you just want to tell people who come over that you are hacking the matrix. Throughout the game there are very few graphic representations, and when there are the best you could hope for is an animated picture (usually just static images, though). It would be easy to dismiss these issues as ""part of the experience"" but that's just a cheesy way of dodging ""Its a really old game, you will have to deal with terrible graphics"". Admittedly, though, it IS easy to overlook the visuals, simply because its what you expect to see on some TV hacker's monitor.Gameplay-wise, once you know how to do it, and get personaly experinced with it, you can get all the money you ever want within a few hours from starting and there is little replay value until you leave long enough to forget how to play. This is problematic and game length ties in directly to how good you are at it. You could beat the game in an hour and a half if you know what you are doing.Don't spoil it for yourself and look up how to start the ending! You will have more fun figuring it out for yourself!Being a very old game, it also has interface problems. No scroll-wheel support being the worst offender, the necessity to have your mouse hovering over any information box you are trying to type in is a close second. Its a pain, and something to be aware of, but it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the game once you are used to it (Using the tab button is an easy fix to the second one).At the end of the day, Its certainly worth the 10$, but should you still be on the fence about it, it goes on sale for crazy low prices. Just whatever you do: make SURE you don't miss out on this game!			"

												All I know about real-life hacking is that it looks incredibly boring. It's all command prompts and IP addresses. Who wants to type in hexadecimal? Ew. It's nothing like TV hacking, where you are a magical techno-wizard that's all about throwing programs like spells and racing the clock in a dramatic race against the significantly less attractive system administrator.Uplink is TV Hacking: The Game.

												This game is old, showing its age, and may not be supported on future operating systems well. As an example, the IRC program inside doesn't run well with current IRC security protocols (it /does/ connect to real servers.)But that doesn't mean this isn't a hell of a good game and still pretty much one of a kind.This game takes inspiration from Hollywood hacking and turns it into an excellent simulation of such. A sandbox roguelike of sorts, you need wits, some planning, and a little luck to become rich, powerful, and save the internet from some bad guys that feel it's time to unplug everything.I believe Introversion could make a new Uplink with the skills they've gained from games they've created since 2001, and release something truly golden. The market for hacking simulations is pretty much dominated by this decade old game, so something more 21st century would most definitely be a hit.Until then, enjoy Uplink, and good luck on the net.Edit: Since I finally realized my review had become one of the most popular, I did a long-needed once over for grammar. Sadly, I'm still waiting for my Uplink 2020 :(			"

												Uplink. Where do I start? It’s got such great game-play; it was inspired by Hollywood hacking scenes where the character or antagonist rapidly types at keys in vain hope to cause lots of damage. And given its base, it fulfils it well. It has high passed action scenes where you’re screaming at your screen to rapidly crack the password while trying not to get caught. Who says that you need the latest 3D graphics to engage someone in a game? I mean yes Battlefield 4 looks pretty but it will never be able to tell a story like Thomas Was Alone. If you can look beyond the dated graphics then you’ll see a great game. I think it was such a great first game for Introversion and can’t wait to see how Prison Architect turns out to be!Overall, I think that everyone should give this classic ago, grab it while it’s on offer. It’ll be a decision that you won’t regret, trust me. "

												Probably THE best full-hacking experience available in video game form.Encompasses what you would expect from Hollywood-style hacking, simple and accessible enough where playing it isn't a chore, but still challenging and interesting enough to have you hooked for countless hours, and you're sure to play the game from the beginning many times.The main story is actually quite engrossing too, it kicks in after about an in-game week of freelance hacking, and not all is what it seems.The game is entirely text and 2D graphics based, so even though it's from 2001, it doesn't suffer for it, it looks just as fine as it did the day it was released.No other game, past or present, has captured hacking in video game form better than this game. If you've admired hacking in Hollywood movies and want a tense gaming experience mimicking that, chances are you've already played and loved this game. But if by chance you haven't, pick it up immediately.			"

												This is really everything I wanted from an indie hacking game. It is a vast and glorious sandbox brimming with opportunity. To tell its tale, let me start the story about twenty-five years ago, with a little gem from Interplay called ""Neuromancer.""Neuromancer was an amazing piece of work, for its time. A point and click adventure game, yes, but with a vast collection of BBS-like ""sites"" in ""cyberspace,"" which could be accessed and navigated spatially, a sea of semitransparent polygons on a sprawling grid. They called the book ""prophetic"" in its vision of what a global computer network might be like, but the game was similarly visionary, in that it offered a classic milestone-and-unlocked-door-driven main story, but with a vast and layered world of enriching side stories and tiny details easily overlooked, that add depth and character to the world in which your character lives. This was a level of detail and nuance and supporting gameworld-enrichment that Bioware would go on to become famous for, in its epic D&D games of the Nineties, and in its later adventure games, but in the Eighties, on computers that were much more limited in resources, this was a bigger feat, and a bigger surprise to the player. You could just play Neuromancer to win it, or you could play it to learn about it, follow the exchanges on the PAX and on private sites, the private message exchanges between AIs. You could learn so much more that way, if you were clever and patient enough to retain it, to piece it together, and to make sense of it all.It had its limitations, though. For all that supplemental-story richness, hacking was extremely primitive and frankly, rather RPG-combat-like. There wasn't much finesse to it, and though there was some pressure to stay alert and focused, it lacked the sweaty-fingers-and-hurry-hurry-hurry aspect we associate with computer crime. Now here's where Uplink steps onto the scene.Uplink isn't a classic RPG -- whether or not it's an RPG at all is a very good question, and I'm not sure how to address the question without spoilers. The game starts very simply; you're a hacker with a server in a colocation facility, and through it, you can access the internet. Your employer offers you access to a database of open hacking jobs commensurate to your demonstrated ability and toolkit, and you can carry them out for money. For many people, this is the entire game of Uplink -- choosing jobs, carrying them out, getting paid. It's fun stuff! The clock is always ticking. Traces are run to try to find you. You've got that sweaty palms, twitchy-taut-nerves, GO GO GO GO GO adrenaline headspace, typing and tapping and trying frantically to get the job done and wipe logs before you're traced and busted. But why stop there? What I feel I can safely say without spoilers is that the game is very much a sandbox, and as your means grow, you find yourself able to make decisions about the nature and purpose of your work. Who you work for, why you work, what work you do and don't do, and what you're after will determine what the game looks like, to you. A rich and detailed world sprawls before you, full of interesting things to learn, do and find. Curiosity is rewarded. Tinkering is rewarded. Ingenuity is especially rewarded. There is a ""master story,"" but whether or not you ever even encounter it -- well, that's up to you.The game uses a very retro interface style; it reminded me of the turn-of-the-millennium retrofuture aesthetic, and made me nostalgic for the days of multiple Unix flavors on huge proprietary hardware. Be sure to be very, very glib with your mouse skills; fast accurate clicking is a must. A touchscreen system with a keyboard would probably be ideal, but rest assured, this Uplinker runs just fine on his non-touchscreen laptop. Speed is critical, a cool head and the ability to systemically run through a list of easy but specific tasks with a ticking timer is also critical. If you don't like to be under pressure, Uplink isn't for you. If you're looking for great visual beauty and visual exploration as found in, say, point-and-click adventure games, look elsewhere. You'll spend all your time in Uplink staring at a virtual desktop environment. Some people will find that thrilling -- I'm one of 'em! -- and some will surely be put off by it. Uplink also enforces consequences beautifully; really bad decisions will even wipe your savegame, be warned. (Can you back it up sneakily and restore it? Yes, yes you can, you...cheating hacker, you.) But most of all, if you're looking for a game that makes it easy to understand what you're supposed to do, this is utterly not the game for you. Uplink's as silent and as uncommunicative as a bash prompt, and that's why it's perfectly suited to the right kind of oldschool-hackerly mind.You've probably formed a strong opinion of Uplink already, just from what I've said. Good. If you're the sort who loves this sort of thing, Uplink is the game you've been waiting for, and there's nothing quite like it. This is what Neuromancer wanted to be like, I think...and might have been, but for that its dreams of electric sheep were limited in resolution and framerate by its era.			"

												Uplink sets itself up like a modified computer desktop, and casts you as a wannabe hacker. From your terminal you'll receive missions, install new software, and try to sneak undetected into the digital infrastructures of some made up mega-corps.If you want to get in and out undetected you'll need to bounce your connection around the world, crack passwords with decryption programs, and delete any trace you've left of your time stealing business secrets and changing personal information.The game hides its mechanics behind a veil of realism. There's no pause button, and plenty of typing, emails to read, and bank accounts to create and manage.In fact, if you turn off the techno soundtrack it's easy to pretend you really are a movie hacker, diving through firewalls as you try and pull off the perfect digital heist from the comfort of your tablet.The game punishes mistakes with swift retribution, and the fictional company that you're working for is quick to disavow your actions and kick you back to the bottom of the pile if you're caught poking your nose somewhere it doesn't belong.Watching a trace creep ever closer to your location can turn even the simplest of hacks into a frantic race against time. The problem is that those moments of real tension are few and far between, and more often than not you'll complete a job without batting an eyelid. Things get repetitive, too, and while you'll unlock new hacking methods as you progress the back doors you use to sneak into systems are always basically the same.Uplink is clearly a labour of love, and if you enjoyed the original you'll feel the same about this version, but newcomers will likely find the slow pace and esoteric style a little off-putting.

When the database stops on the name I check my email and do as requested and when I am done I confirm it and reply. I wait for confirmation before disconnecting and deleting my logs just incase there was a spelling error. The email comes as expected so I disconnect and proceed to delete my logs from INTERNIC, I connect, select admin, choose the passwor- and then everything goes black. My heart stops, what happened? Has the game frozen? Did I press the windows key? No my hand was only on my mouse it's impossible but then wh- and it hits me harder than a brick to the back of the head. It was over, atleast that's how it seemed but that was impossible, I deleted my logs, there was no trace or proof what was going on?! I frantically waited for what seemed like hours as I stared at my own reflection awaiting the inveitable...It was over, my gateway terminated, I had failed. All the time spent learning and perfecting my skills wasted all because I had forgotton 1 log or at the expense of just my gateway turning on my motion sensor.10/10 Would become millionairre and then lose it all because I'm an idiot again.

												Uplink is a mostly text based game released in 2001. This cyberpunk title is set the near future, the year 2010, and hackers slither around the interwebs. You play as a hacker working for Uplink Corporation, a company that offers illegal hacker services to others.The aim of the game is to climb up the hacker fame ladder and make cash. You do so by completing contracts, making relationships with others and upgrading your software, hardware and gateway. All together, it feels like a shadowrun type of game.You're breaking into the ""Knight Tech"" computer network. Your mission is to locate and destroy a file. You gain access to the file storage system and your proxies fail, the tracers are going crazy indicating that you're close to being traced. You franticly look for the file and delete it just in the nick of time, avoiding a hefty fine and possibly a jail sentence. Intense moments like these really make uplink shine, and that's just one badly described example from many different mission types.Though the game does have some annoying UI problems and the soundtrack is only 4 songs, it's still a great game if you're interested in cyberpunk dystopias, or a satisfying progression system and not expecting a story.8/10 "

I speed up the time so it can get installed, log out, and log back in. Then, I go purchase all the hardware upgrades, starting with the motion sensor and gateway nuke. Speed up time again until the sensor and nuke is installed, and I open the sensor program. I see that it's red, so I panic and open the nuke program to destroy the gateway. It gets destroyed, and I rent the starting gateway again. After purchasing another Trinity and wait for it to be installed, I realized I didn't get an email from Uplink saying federal agents seized my destroyed gateway. I thought maybe it was just a bug, until I purchased and installed another motion sensor and nuke. I opened it up, and saw that it was red again. At this point, I'm pretty annoyed and didn't feel like purchasing yet another gateway, so I wait to see what happens. The red disappears. Then, it hit me. The sensor was detecting the people installing the hardware.Great game.			"

												So you found this in your recomended tab or searched for hacking games because you want to play a cool hacking game. If so then Uplink is the game for you, from what i have seen on steam this may be the best hacking game for sale... and its over ten years old! Now that I am done my shpeal here are the pros and cons (As is necessary for any game review)Pros:Great and immersive worldAmazing storyDeaths dont feel cheap*RoguelikeYou feel like a badass hacker when your hacking is reported on the newsStrangely enjoyable paranoia and stressEndless replayabilityYou can tell the devs put their heart and soul into thisConsWhen starting out percieved difficulty is increadibly high (Before realising I needed a log deleter I thought the game was unfairly killing me)*Roguelike this can be a turnoff for some peopleNo ability to undelete files if you are carefull this is a non issue (Accidentaly deleted Faith)Some items can be a bit pricyTeaser about Uplink 2 (Multiplayer hacking into other peoples Uplink stuff)... Uplink 2 will sadly never be releasedAll in all this is 100X better as a hacking game than watchdogs or (Insert relevent hacking game here) and is much less expensive. Now then I have to go deal with some government agents knocking at my door...			"

												Easy to learn, very, very hard to master. In this realistic hacking game (yes, that exists), you will probably lose at least three or four times before you even reach the top-10 list (you start at 20-something). Then you'll lose again because you forgot to delete you logs properly that *one* time. This game's fun is not about the excitment of hacking into secure systems and performing movie-geek-like feats. Most of the hacking is done by automated scripts, and your sole job is to make sure you don't get caught.That's where the fun lies. Being methodical, precise and never allowing yourself to make a single mistake. Give the feds a single opening, and they'll be on you faster than you can say ""♥♥♥♥, did I forget to erase my logs?""My most recent run ended when I stole one million (a lot!) credits from a bank. I did everything with scalpel precision: I erased my logs, deleted the transaction from the target account... And I lost as soon as I realized I'd forgotten to delete the transaction from my own account.So if you're wondering about buying this game, yes. If you're not against slightly repetitive gameplay and the fact that you will die, Get this game and enjoy it as I am.Stay vigilant, don't breathe until after your tracks are fully covered and, whatever you do, never get sloppy.

												Produced by Introversion, the team who went on to develop the equally brilliant Prison Architect, this early game was one of the highlights of the very original indie scene back before indie became all new again.  It was released in 2001 originally, and back then, the net login screens looked rather more similar to the blue winsock connection screens that PC users were then familiar with (I remember being a little nervous thinking that the software really was connecting to an external system - not a mistake I would make had I have bought the game today).  As with indie titles today, it brought innovation and a unique premise to the table, and put Introversion firmly on the map.  Uplink is a hacking game (no programming knowledge needed; it's 98% point-and-click hacking) with missions, a plot, and a whole lot of tension.  And the second you are caught, not only is it 'Game Over', but your save file is wiped along with your credits and ranking.  There is no going back, and no 'undo'.Don't get caught!Uplink is tense without being stressful, and makes you feel like you are achieving and progressing as hacks become steadily more difficult, dangerous and more lucrative.  At first, you'll just be stealing or destroying the odd file here and there, but it won't be long before you are altering student academic records, robbing social security identities, poking through government databases, robbing thousands from high security banks and becoming embroiled in a dark plot affecting a fellow agent.  You will need to purchase more advanced security and hacking software tools, bypass proxys and firewalls, and upgrade your Uplink Gateway (your terminal) with faster CPUs, bigger memory banks and devices to protect your security.And all of it is done by clicking on stuff - no commands need to be learnt and typed.  You might need to type in the occasional name or alter a record, but that's all.  The game offers a basic tutorial to show you how to complete your first basic hack and talks you through a couple of essential tools you'll use from the start.Whether you just work through increasingly difficult missions, choose to go it alone to steal money to upgrade more quickly or follow the campaign, uplink offers hundreds of hours of quality game for very little money.  I love hacking games, but Uplink will probably always remain my favourite just because of its clever balance of a simple user interface with increasingly difficult hacks.An easy 10/10_______________________(note: I have hundreds, maybe thousands, of hours invested in this game since its release in 2001; the few hours recorded here simply show time for the Steam version)			"

												I enjoyed Uplink very much, and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a hacking simulator. [*NOTE: This is not a command prompt hacker, like other games, it's a simple, yet comlicated, easy to use, hard to master, point and click.]You start off by registering as an ""Uplink"" agent. Fancy words for freelance hacker. You select a Gateway, in one of many large popular cities. New York, or Chicago to name two of them. I usually choose Chicago. Then, once you've done that, you connect to the Gateway and are turned loose on the world. Uplink has an internal server you can connect to in the games server list. This is where you'll buy new programs for youre hacking needs, or new hardware for youre Gateway. I'd highly recommend buying a lvl 1 password breaker, lvl 1 trace tracker, and lvl 1 Log deleter. The trace tracker isn't very efficiant. You can upgrade it later by completing missions and buying it. There's a mission list in the internal service too. If you need money or just bored. [*Note you need reputation to accept these things. You can get basic rep by completing the tutorial.] You can hack just about every server and cause comlplete chaos. You can even hack into banks and run off loaded. Just be cautious, one small slip up is your doom. This is just the short version. If you want more try this yourself. Enjoy Uplink a cool hacking game, and remember Agents, Trust Is A Weakness. Good Luck!			"

												Uplink is a surprisingly fun game that you can play over and over again.  The learning curve is pretty steep and will require some online research in order to understand and play the game properly.  The text is also hard to read and strains the eyes over time.  This is probably due to that fact that it is a 13 year old game and isn't properly optimized for HD monitors.  Anyways, outside of that, it is a very well thought out game that actually becomes a little addicting.  The storyline has a few different endings and you can decide to play along or ignore them all together.  The HUD and music are extremely dated which adds to the whole experience in such a great way.  For the age of the game though, I think that $10 is a little too expensive.  It is most definitely worth a buy if you can find it on sale.8/10 "

												Uplink is a game that simulates being a hacker. It is novel and superficially well-done, but after I played for an hour or so, the novelty wore off and I was left with a lot of flawed and confusing game mechanics.Pros:+ Very immersive. The game does a nice job of making you feel like the main character. In fact, it almost feels like you are a real hacker at times.+ Good sense of gradually building yourself up from scratch. There is a certain satisfaction in upgrading your programs and computers step by step.Cons:- A lot of aspects of the game are very poorly explained. Once you get through the basics, you have to look everything up on the internet because what the different hacking programs do and how/when to use them is very unclear. Several times I literally didn't know what I was supposed to be attempting in a mission.- Poor mission variety makes the game very repetitive. Add to this the fact that a given mission can be completed exactly the same way every time you get it. Mission are fun the first one or two times you get each one, but then just become a chore.- The game mechanics are very susceptible to tricks, loopholes, and exploits. This is the type of game that seems very hard until you figure out a couple of little tricks that make it painfully easy. Then it just becomes a repetitive grind of using the same tricks over and over. I'm honestly not sure if several of the techniques I used were the intended mechanics of the game or were game-breaking oversights.			"

												Unique hacking game by Introversion Software, which currently are the developers of Prison Architect.Uplink was released more than a decade ago, yet it aged well.In the game you're a hacker working for Uplink, a company which employs hackers (agents) providing them with remote gateways, which they connect from their personal computers.You are one of those agents.The goal is to hack your way into richness, so you can buy the best software and hardware available, and eventually you will receive e-mails offering special missions, which is the plot.The bad parts is that figuring out how to play the game and hack advanced systems (like Banks, Mainframes and Lans) is a lot of fun, but doesn't offer much replayability once you've got everything figured out. This results in a repetitive feeling. Plus, the plot and it's results are a shallow, leaving the player wanting for more. It is, still, a great game.Unfortunately, the developers didn't make a sequel (even though they had planned it), but it's a game you won't forget after you play it.			"

												Very cool game if youre into that sort of thing. It does need the UplinkOS overhaul-mod to look more attractive for 2016. But once you get that - youll never go back.Although in the beginning, it was kinda hard to figure out what to do and what not to do - But alas after 10 hours of trial and error, I learned enough to trace a bank account with over a million credits. I hacked the account, transferred everything to my own account, deleted the log-statements - Hacked into my own account and deleted my own statements. Then I cleaned up my logs on my admin system. So now I have over a million credits. Bought the best rig and all upgrades and still have credits to spare. So now what - That was a bit too easy. What im saying is that, its kinda lacking in the endgame. But there is a story ""quest"" you get mailed about at some point.Other than that - I was just bored. So If you want to have fun in this game. Dont try and hack accounts to get rich. Just do the missions and thank me later - Being rich is boring.  Cool game with fun and demanding challenges.

												PC Version:The game is brilliant.You live in a distant future, able to own a Gateway.Gateway is a hacking dedicated hi tech machine.You connect to a special company interface and the fun begins.It isn't for everyone though. You have to dig a little to learn how to play.It has a tutorial of course, but you have to lose some times before learning how to turn the bank system into your bit-ch.On the other hand, after learning your how to do stuff, you can start a new game at any time, play a little, get some credits, buy the essentials and then do it again. Hacking banks early actually speeds up the game.What else do you wanna do as a hired hacker in this game?Maybe steal or desrtroy data?  Change academic grades and titles for someone?Maybe incriminate someone, or clear criminal records?How about get involved into the virus vs anti-virus global battle?The game has an ongoing story. Keep reading the news. Better yet be part of the news.This game with its simple interface worth your attention.Only if you  run Steam on Windows.The game crashes on start in Linux.

 10 years and still kicking  This game has been out for 10 years and I just recently got it and instantly became addicted due to the amout of moral choices and stratagies this game has to offer. You can do anything within your limits, from robbing a bank, ruining lives, creating new identities and even betraying the company you work for, but im getting ahead of myself.   The Story The story of this game is fairly simple, although its told in the first 5 minutes of the game ill say it here. You work for Uplink, a company that help you start your career by providing your own gateway and job offers and allowing you to buy software and hardware to help you on your journy.    Game Over Your journy can end in many differant ways and uplink will be forced to shut down your account and gateway forcing you to make a new account and start over. Here are a few ways your journy may come to a swift end, (Do not read if you want to experience them yourself)  Being caught hacking into somewhere, Not paying a fine, Betraying uplink, abandoning too many missions, and many more  But don't let being shut down stop you as it will help you improve greatly   My Opinion This game is a great time killer and is definently worth your money. I have play for over 7 hours already and still haven't experienced all this game has to offer. The game provides everything you need to succeed, this game deserves a much larger following as it is a great example of how games are art.

												Hacking simulation are an entirely different breed all together. They stand apart from your typical simulation of any other kind (to the extent of my knowledge, which is mostly shooters). It's certainly a game for the more analytically minded people or for someone who is looking for something ENTIRELY DIFFERENT from the rest of the crowd. It can be a bit tedious at times because there's a lot to worry about in order to succeed.DO NOT BE FOOLED. This is not a game full of hacking minigames that you're used to seeing in many other larger titles. It is NOT a ""guide the virus ship thru wave of attacking enemies"" game. It's build a rig, network, break in, and accomplish something. More a thinking mans game.			"

The tutorial was made for human comprehension, and the difficulty was well adapted to each lvl. No major bug was found, which IS a plus nowadays (sigh). Can really make you nervous at times though, esp when you hear the Trace Tracker beeping while you're hacking... Good for killing times and, well, learning NSA essential concepts :P8/10[CHN]又是一个骇客游戏，不过没有命令行的烦扰...虽然个人更喜欢高逼格的命令行，但游戏本身还是差强人意（褒义词！）的。比Hacker Evolution不知高到哪里去了，特别是教程啊难度啊之类的。游戏bug不多，就这点上堪称业界良心。攻击服务器时的紧张感拿捏得挺好，特别是听到trace tracker 越来越密集的嘀嘀嘀声Orz。打发时间或者学习国安网络基础常识都挺好。8/10 "

From there you go about as a freelance hacker getting all sorts of cool missions (That you choose) from Uplink. There is a underlining story in the game that is really, really cool, you don't have to do it but if you don't do any of the storys missions then at some point you will get a game over. This could make some stop, but this game draws you into its world, and soon you could be spending Hours finding new ways to conquer it.			"

I thorougly enjoyed the game, the ending was good (although from what I remember- not super surprising), and they progress you from not very hard hacking into complex multi subnet and private network hacking (the most fun parts!).

												Uplink (2001) is a hacking game in the fictional ""future"" of 2010. The game was created by Introversion Software, a merry little indie company with active developers. While development for this game has ceased, fans, such as Miah and Tycho from Ferrous Moon (Onlink) and Cpt. McBacon of Uplink OS, continue to make the game stand on its own as not only an ""oldie but goodie"" but the continuing benchmark of its genre in 2016.The game itself appears complex, minimal, and dated on first glance. The entire game is basically text and buttons. While not as aesthetically appealing as even some games from the NES, the gameplay is still action-packed. The game features several races against the often invisible clock as the player tries to seize millions of credits in funds, destroy mainframes, and evade the one-world-government's ever-motivated police force. One wrong move often spells curtains for the player if unprepared.Uplink was a game without creative comparison during its time. Instead of the endless derivations from popular console titles, Uplink was a rare success for a game inspired by movies. As we learned from the Angry Video Game Nerd, games based on movies are often on a poor foundation (and LJN certainly didn't help)! Uplink answered the demand for Hollywood-style hacking that no other popular game could offer at the time.One common complaint about the game is that it is complex and very difficult to play without additional walkthroughs and documentation beyond what is provided by the game. The in-game tutorial only covers one type of mission and offers a very inefficient method for removing logs - a chore that can end the game if neglected merely an hour into the game.The game, however, seeks to emulate a hostile environment where you learn as you go and by trial-and-error. The game, unlike other games of this time period, does not wish to hold your hand through it. And through this dearth of information, it has great replay value as you learn from past mistakes, learn even more about how the game works in more complex situations, and find new challenges and secrets.I highly recommend this game, and proclaim this game should be the rightful owner of the ""Test of Time"" Award.

												What is Uplink: Hacker Elite?Imagine an alternate universe 2010, one where the Internet is home to mega-corperations, private groups of individuals, and minnimal Government rule. One where, given the right actions, you can be taken away without a trace.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Welcome to Uplink Corperation. You are here because you wish to join this company. -----------------------------------------------------------------------Uplink is a unique game where you assume the role of yourself, signing up to become an agent of the Uplink Corporation. After installing the Uplink OS on your computer, you're prompted to take a short tutorial on how to gain access to a protected system and copy a file. After that you're completely on your own.The game takes place in a dystopian 2010 version of the Internet. Everything you do is logged by a myriad of consoles, system admins, and scanners. Your job is to gain access into protected systems to do various jobs for clients on the Uplink servers. These tasks range from copying or deleting a few files, to ruining someone's life and having innocent people arrested; all while avoiding getting caught yourself.You progress through the game by use of your Gateway - a computer located in a remote location away from your PC. This Gateway can be upgraded with different kinds of hardware, or you could rent out an entirely new Gateway altogether. In the case that you should get caught by Government officials, your Gateway is destroyed and your reputation with the Uplink Corporation is completely dismissed. In other words, it's Game Over. To avoid this, you have to discretely bypass security, trick and spoof automated systems, delete logs, all while doing your job as fast as you can to avoid a trace. If you do ultimately get traced, you have the expensive and dangerous option of pairing a motion sensor with a detonator. Should the time come, your Gateway will be destroyed, and you'll start back with your potato Gateway.Uplink has a really immersive atmosphere. The interface is incredibly simplistic and the music accompanying it only adds to this. It gives the game that ""Punk-techno hacker"" feel and gives you the sense that you're the one hacking into these secure computer systems and you're the one wrecking havoc on mega-corporations and the Government. There's even a series of story missions that you can choose to or to not partake in. Regardless of what happens, you're completely free to do whatever you want to. You have complete freedom in this game and, while it may be overwhelming and confusing at first, it only makes you more satisfied once you figure out how to traverse another secure system.I highly recommend Uplink to anyone who's interested in technology, hacking, or anything relating to computers. Some may compare it to Hacknet, but this game has loads more to offer for the asking price. Just remember, when it comes to working in this field-Trust is a Weakness. "

												Uplink is one of the most diverse, interesting, and replayable games I've ever seen. Time and time again, I find new hidden secrets baked into this game! Uplink is not a realistic simulation of hacking, rather, it is a condensation of the ""Movie Hacking"" scene, where you can break passwords in seconds, and take down systems in minutes.Uplink has a very 'freelance' style to it. You can choose to do missions, or you can ignore them if you wish, doing whatever you want! Saying any more would spoil the game, so I'm just going to stop there... =D			"

												If you're looking for a hacking game, then this is it. Nothing else even comes close!You get to ruin people's lives, destroy mainframes, penetrate high security networks, use voice analyzers and chat to strangers online! What more could you want? An open-world sandbox and smartphones? Pff. Really though. Uplink is Hollywood-style hacking (Think of the 1995 movie, Hackers, but a little bit more true to reality) at its best, compressed into a game and far more addictive and immersive than you would expect. The entire game is quite fast paced, and there is always something to do. There are missions you can accept from clients, or you can simply go rogue and do your own thing. Regardless of your choice, tension and stress will be prominent, and are a mechnic that is used very effectively. One small mistake can lead to you being caught and disavowed, meaning that you'll need to take extra precaution before initiating a hack, during a hack and even after successfully completing a hack. All of this creates a tense atmosphere during an attack, and while some may find it offputting, I found it to be incredibly immersive and enjoyable. If you're at all interested in network security, fictional or non-fictional representations of hacking, then you're going to love Uplink! "

												This game is truly a benchmark in the hacking genre making it smile while still keeping the complex side. It has a story you can choose to follow or just ignore but the most amazing thing is that this game can keep you entertained for hours even when you have no more story nor computer upgrades to get. Although this version is not fully moddable like the off-steam version I can forgive that because it is still a game that i'd play over and over again.(7/10) - Benchmark game wth outstanding gameplay but dated with no new updates nor supported by dev mods. score breakdown :gameplay = 5/10 + Benchmark = 5/10 - dated = 1/10 - dev mods not supported = -2/10 = (7/1)			"

												One low level mission told me to delete a very important file, so i did. After i completed that mission i got a new rank. I decided to try out a harder mission, so i accepted one that told me to steal research files. Apparently, the research file i was supossed to steal was the exact same file i was told to delete in the previous mission. I decided to abandon the new mission since it was impossible to complete. Sadly i was deranked and had to grind a few low level missions some more just to rank up again. It's a fun game, but it has some minor issues like i explained in my story, but other than that i would recommend the game for people who are into puzzle-ish strategy games.			"

												""Hello, agent. If you are reading this message, it means that I am dead"".Uplink is one of this great hacking simulators that lead you into the skin of an elite hacker, a real pro that from the computer of his home (and the terminal bought to Uplink) is able to get into the most secure systems in the world and do anything: steal information, destroy it, frame innocent people, free criminals, steal-hack millions of credits from unaware bank accounts... and much more.The learning curve is steady: You will need to read the help guide in order to start your career, and you will need to fail main times before you master the process. But once you manage to control the basics, the really interesting stuff starts: Get into a LAN and hack against the clock while the LAN's administrator is trying to trace your location to warn the authorities; get critical information from evil corporations and try to stop them before it is too late, follow the trace of another hacker and hand him/her over to a company... for the right price...Uplink is a one of a kind, if you ask me. Simple enough to get anybody hooked to it, yet difficult enough so it is a challenge to complete. And also, a game that has manage to stay fresh and beautiful after so many years. I just wish that at some point a new version, or even a DLC of this game will be released.			"

												*~I've rewritten my entire review, as my last one was lackluster.~*Uplink is a fairly interesting game, unlike any other I've played before. Uplink is a game where you assume the role as an agent of Uplink; a company with hackers(crackers) for hire. Simply put, you take a job, do the job, and get paid. While it sounds simple, there's much more to it than just going in, doing something, and it's over, especially when you start taking on more difficult jobs.A majority of the gameplay consists of, as stated above, taking jobs from one of the many companies in the game and executing the desired task(s). There are many different types of jobs, all of which have their own difficulty. Jobs range from attacking a system to copy or delete one or two files to copying or destroying entire databases, attacking company LANs, cracking into bank systems and much more. You may also fuel your own desires, and perhaps crash the global system.With the money you collect, you're able to upgrade your hardware and software. Hardware consists of the gateway *The case*, CPUs, memory *Serves as storage*, the modem, and security, all of which, excluding memory and security, have different ""levels"". Upgrading your hardware lets you complete tasks faster, store more data, and avoid going to jail if you ever make a little mistake and the police come to confiscate your gateway. While it may not be clear at first, you will eventually become involved in the story of Uplink, which comes with drastic decisions and results. (No spoilers here)Mods for Uplink exist, and while there may not be many compared to other games, there are a fair amount ot custom skins and gateways. Modding the game is very simple as well, and anybody with a painting program can make a mod for Uplink with no extra software required. While most mods may be skins, there is a completely separate game (mod, if you will) called Onlink, which is Uplink with much much more content added.  I suggest checking out Onlink for yourself, and looking at how much more it adds.The layout of the game is fairly simple, and reminds me of Windows 95 - 2000. When playing the game, I recommend playing at a resolution of 1024 x 768 or lower. A lower resolution makes for a better experience in my opinion, as text may be harder to read on bigger resolutions, and the game is from 2001, thus the GUI is designed for smaller screens. The game is perfectly functional at bigger resolutions, however. As for hardware requirements, you should have no difficulty playing Uplink, unless you're running a system with the minimum requirements for Windows 2000.The gameplay of Uplink may seem repetitive to some, especially after finishing a game or two. While it can be repetitive, most of the repetition is during the early stages of the game, and as you get better equipment, you have many more jobs to do, thus alleviating the early repetition. As for a downside to gameplay, *potential spoiler*  you're never told how to delete access logs, which are files left on the comptuers you bounce your connection to in order to refrain from having companies directly identify who you are. In order to stand a chance in the mid-to-late game, you must know how to delete your access logs from the first comptuer in your bounce connection. I learned the hard way.I definitely recommend Uplink, especially on sale for $2.49. It's a game where you get to live the fantasy of being a hacker in an action-packed way.			"

												Uplink is one of the best hacking ""simulators"" out there, obviously it's not as easy to break into a system for real as it shown here, but it does a good job. The story kicks in after a few weeks of freelance hacking, accepting missions from other corporations to steal, delete or otherwise screw with other corporations info. You work for the Uplink corporation, well known for being a place where hackers can pickup missions to gain credits and improve their Uplink rating, unlocking more difficult missions. After a brief tutorial which you can skip, you're dropped into the world with a few thousand credits and a low Uplink rating. Your first missions will consist of: Break into X's system and delete/steal Y file. It picks up later with missions like: Here's this person's account number for X bank, break into it and send us their bank balance or loan. Sometime's they'll want you to transfer Y Credits to Z account. Security gradually increases over time, your basic internal servcies machine will only be running a monitor, which basically just says: Hey this IP is running software that's trying hundreds of passwords very quickly, start tracing this IP and mark those logs as suspicous. Then it introduces thing like Firewalls and Proxy severs, Proxy servers allowing you to read, but not modify files or logs and firewalls performing a similar role, you'll have to bypass them or disable them.Bypassing is the ""stealthy"" route if done right they'll never know anyone broke into the system, but as a trade off you require a certain HUD upgrade and the bypassers themselves, which are quite costly. Disabling on the otherhand is the ""noisy"" route, as once something has been disabled it will be noticed immediately. But these disablers are cheaper and don't reqiure the HUD upgrade but they take time to work.Various missions pose troublesome though, most notably the ""Trace a hacker who recently broke into our system"" missions.You accept it and go to their system, they say the attack occured at X time and you login with the details provided, but you cannot access the logs, you need admin access, so you have to go back, load up your bounch path, break in, look at the logs and match them to the time given, and then gradually follow the chain back until you reach someone's PC. However if you accept the mission when It's going gray on the BBS, these missions are almost impossible to complete, as the attacker has cleared their tracks and you don't know who did it. So you have to abandon the mission, which causes your Uplink rating to drop, heavily. Unfortunately there is no offical sequel, but there is a spirtitual successor called Hacknet, comparing the two I call this the ""Hollywood"" hacking sim. It's not as realistic but it's more fun, you're given free reign to do whatever you wish.Still an amazing game after all these years and definately worth picking up, I'd reccommend watching some tutorials if you're new.

												In Uplink you play as a lone wolf hacker on his quest for noteriety, money, and booty.Jokes aside, this is a great game.This game simulates what it is like to be a cliched movie hacker. You got multiple tools to purchase from the black market and use against some of the many, possibly randomly generated missions. The UI makes this easy thanks to its retro, non-clutered design.Overall, it is possibly one of the best indie games of all time. 8/10.			"

												This is an old game from 2001 that still holds up to date and has a ton of fairly good mods. On of which the devs of the game just recently spotlighted themselfs called Uplink OS. This is a game I got 13-14 years ago on disk (which I still have), and still come back to and play from time to time. The only reason my play time shows so low is because well I have been playing the version from the disc and not from Steam because why reinstall a bunch of mods when I already have the game installed on the computer, main reason I have a second copy despite still having the original disc (and a backed up burned copy just incase the disc goes bad) is because I picked up the Intovision humble bundle so got a second copy. It's one of only a few games I will occationally replay despit it being 15 years old.If you pick it up now I would definitly suggest the Uplink OS mod which the devs spotlighted, just google Uplink OS and you should find it on moddb, it really helps out the UI and gameplay a ton (which the original was still really good and worth playing as well, but the mod definitly helps with some of the more tedious unneccisary parts on the game while not changing general game play).All in all I think the only 4 games I have more game time in then this game is WoW, Binding of Isaac, The Secret World, and Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 on Dreamcast, and I play a ton of JRPGs to completion twice through, and that takes a long time to do.

												I've played this over and over and have found it to be so much fun. The intial game involves slinging programs at everything that moves, crossing your fingers and hoping that you haven't left yourself vulnerable, the later part of the game involves more roguelike elements where you traverse networks and puzzle out their architecture. This really is the only game of its kind, and I hope that someone will release an updated, more in-depth version with perhaps more features that make this game more visually entertaining as well. But if you want a hacking sim without the programming, then this honestly is the game for you.			"

												If you ever wanted to feel like an elite internet wizard, this is a pretty good game to satisfy your fantasy.Uplink is a ""kind-of"" hardcore but extremely fun and rewarding when you don't mess up ""hacking sim."" It's very easy to learn but hard to master. You can do anything, from altering people's academic records through criminal convictions to siphoning all the funds from their bank account and then framing them for any crime you can possibly think of.It also has a storyline you can take part in, with two sides to choose from. It's not mandatory to participate in though, I sat on the sidelines (abandoned both quests) and hacked into banks to afford more powerful CPUs so I can crack passwords at light speed, and the game didn't punish me in any way. The good guys win if you choose not to interfere, which is actually unique and neat!The soundtrack is fantastic, too; it's very similar to Deus Ex's and Unreal Tournament 99's.You can even bite the hand that feeds you and hack into Uplink Corporation's server and steal their active agent list, decipher it and sell it to the highest bidder leading to a huge rise in deceased agents.All in all, this game is an easily-affordable must have for any game collection out there.PS: If you choose to get it, for the love of all that is holy DELETE YOUR LOGS.If you can't, either through lack of time or by having to disconnect without finishing the hack, go to the first server you bounced through (InterNIC is my recommendation, the password never changes) and remove the ""routed"" logs.

												I have been playing Uplink since about 2010 or so, so all things considered, I have a LARGE amount of undocumented hours (900+). I have purchased the source code and created modifications and let me tell you, even within Chris's code, there are hidden easter eggs that did not make the cut. This game has become an all time favorite of mine. The story line is pretty good, but I have to say it isn't the greatest. There is lots of waiting inbetween missions, but I guess that isn't a bad thing because it lets you recoup any money lost to do a mission.I guess my big complaint with Uplink is that once you reach a certain level (usually around Knowledgable or so), the missions don't chnage much, and there isn't much to do after the story has ended.

If you're not put off by text-based interfaces it's a lot of fun and it's aged pretty well, recalling the classic hacker aesthetic of the early internet. Even though the ""company"" has to ""delete your account"" whenever you get caught, the skills, tricks, and shortcuts that you learn as a player ensure that you can quickly get back to where you were a lot faster than it took you the first time. Every part of the gameplay is contextualized within the in-game universe, so if you want to believe that this game is actually a program that anonymously connects you to an international hacking ring via a proxy computer, the game will never contradict you.

												In this game, you play as a mysterious hacker only known as ""Crash Override."" The main goal of this game is to pull off gnarly hacks and sell out other hackers for money. This game doesn't have much in the way of graphics, in fact it's really just a black screen with some words and a map. But this hacking simulator is not about the visuals, or even the journey, it's about hacking into a criminal database and putting as many people in prison as humanly possible.			"

												This game is absolutley fantastic. This is a company that I have never been disapointed with. Probably because they are not some out of touch developers sitting in a corporate office that have to kiss the feet of some board execs. They get that gamers want to be immersed sometimes, without micro-transactions for game advancements AHEM: EA. This game is just a prime example of how awesome game devs can be.			"

												Despite what Steam claims, I have been playing this game off-and-on since it came out in 2001.This is one of those under-rated classics that always manages to find it's way back onto any system I own, year after year.  And year after year, it fully occupies weeks of my time every time I get back into it.Don't look for fancy graphics, you won't find any here.  Don't look for hand-holding. The tutorial consists of an email with a target's name and not much else.This game has no mercy.  Once you are caught, you are disavowed.  Game over. You lose everything. This game does not pity you, because you were weak and slow and stupid.  Your only recourse is to start again, with nothing to show for your failure but experience.  And that experience is the reason you play this game.			"

												Personally, Uplink is one of the best hacking games out there, and is one of my top 10 favourite games.The game is fun, except for when you're hacking and you forget that one log, and you get busted for it, you just wanna say ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IT! ♥♥♥♥!"", everyone does when they get busted. Especially when you were JUST about to complete that one [SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!] ARC mission which involves you hacking Darwin's LAN and then the SysAdmin is like ""Nah breh, your IP is mine breh."". I hate it when that happens, but let's get to Pros and Cons.Pros:- Story is excellent, I love it like it's my child.- Isn't a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DOS console game, unlike a specific game *cough cough* Hacknet *cough cough*.- IS ACTUALLY FUN! IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING FUN! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?!?!?- ""10/10 would r8 10 again"" - IGN 2015- You can pick a side to be with. Either [HUGE ♥♥♥♥ING SPOILER HERE!] save the Interwebs, or destroy it.- Getting dunked on by San- wait, wrong game.- Getting dunked on by that one spare log.Cons:- Some text is too small to read.- You complete a mission but you don't get paid because of a bug.Overall, Uplink is a great game, so I wish you all luck with hacking, because it's a pane in the glass.

												Uplink is a masterpiece.  It's the game that introduced me to hacking sims, and introduced me to Introversion as a developer.  The game is well paced, the story is fantastic, and I really can't complain about it.  This game has aged remarkable well, and a friend of mine didn't believe me when I told them it was from 2001.

												A 'Hollywood hacking' simulator from 2001, and Introversion Software's first game. Simple systems with interlocking complexity and kickass music combine to make a tense cyberpunk experience. Hack systems, complete contract jobs, earn bucks to upgrade your system, repeat. The story jobs are technically optional, which lets you do other jobs in between (and earn more money which is nice), but you'll run out of other things to do eventually.Unlike some of the more recent games it inspired, Uplink's totally 1337 haxoring is mainly GUI-based - which means clicking all the things - although knowing how to use a command prompt will still help a lot. Once you know what you're doing, the initially rather steep difficulty curve levels out pretty fast, but half the fun comes from pushing yourself as far as you can without screwing up anyway.The biggest problem with Uplink is the lack of variety. It's more fun if you play it in bite-size chunks or have an appetite for grinding, because unless you can find a way of stealing wads of cash or robbing a bank or something, that's what you'll be doing initially to get the gear you need.The typing field UI is also quite finicky, which is anathema to a game centered around...you know, computer hacking. It's not immediately clear that you need to tab to a field to type in it, which is necessary because merely mousing over it only activates the field for as long as your mouse is over it.Uplink's game world is also relatively small in scope for what's supposed to be a corporate subsection of the World Wide Web, but hey, it's a mild dystopia. And also an indie game from 2001. These guys were literally pressing disks in their house to start. That's worthy of respect, if nothing else.Recommended if you're a GIANT NERD like me.			"

												Uplink has been a favorite game of mine since the first day I played it, and I've been playing it off and on through the years since it first came out.  There's something about the atmosphere in the game that is so intense, and which raises your primal senses.  Nothing quite comes close to the satisfaction this game provides of making a good hack while the tracer beep is going crazy, then disconecting to hear a peaceful soundtrack again, uninterrupted by any incoming mails about what you just did.  But not for long, because now the race is on to fix server logs elsewhere...  I've never actually beat Uplink, yet. But over the years I've learned what I need to do, and I'm getting closer.  For me this game is kind of like a fine wine, good in moderation, and leaves me satisfied every time.Highly reccomended if you're up for a unique game, and want to take the role of a hacker on the invisible net!*owned long before steam10/10			"

												This game though it is cheap to buy is worth way more than it's price. I would have to say that this is one of the best games in my Steam library. first off when you get into the game there is a tutorial that helps teach you how to do the basics and then after the three parts to the tutorial you get left to do whatever you want to do. I also like how the game is based off of some real hacking concepts such as jumping from point to point to make tracing you harder and having to delete your logs on one of the computers in the chain as to not get your gateway caught. I reccomend this game to anyone who is into hacking.			"

												A game about hacking? Hell yeah!Edited 11/05/2014:Okay, I've played it for a while, and my best piece of advice is YOU CANNOT BE TOO CAREFUL. Just because your trace tracker isn't registering an active trace doesn't mean there's nobody checking bounce logs and tracking you down. Always delete your logs; I cannot stress that enough. Also, you should probably delete the bounce logs from at least one other system for extra security; the best one for this is the InterNIC server, because it doesn't trace and once you crack the PW you have admin access there forever.Next, when you have to get a new piece of software, I have to advise that you get the best version available. Buying these things one version at a time is not cost-effective; you'll only waste your cred getting a low version and then discovering you need a higher one for that crucial mission so you'll have the cred to get the software you need.On a related note, you MUST be careful how you spend your cred. If you get too many hardware upgrades you won't be able to afford the software you need. However, when you get far enough into the game, there are missions which involve transferring creds between accounts. Once you know how to do that, you can do so for yourself using the same techniques; just remember to cover your tracks!Finally, about Uplink not running on newer OS's, I'm running Windows 8.1 and the game runs just fine. So far, the only thing about it that really annoys me is that it won't scroll with the mouse wheel. However, that doesn't detract from the fun!03/05/2017:The game runs as well as ever on my laptop with Windows 10 Home since I upgraded.Enjoy!			"

Connection bouncing, bypassing proxies and firewalls, breaking passwords, finding and faking voice analysers, editing criminal/social/academic records, complicated and detailed LAN networking, making sure you are not leaving traces and clues for feds, LOADS of software/hardware/gateaway upgrades, etc etc etc.  Buy it, it will surely easily eat your free time and make you feel like a hacker.

The hacking is similar to how hacking works in the movies, but that's fine. The game can get very hard, but if you take your time and learn how to play, you'll be a professional in no time.

It's got a great atmosphere, the gameplay is pretty simple but fun; it's great to build up your computer system until you're reading to tackle elaborate corporate networks.

												A 'Hollywood hacking' simulator from 2001, and Introversion Software's first game. Simple systems with interlocking complexity and kickass music combine to make a tense cyberpunk experience. Hack systems, complete contract jobs, earn bucks to upgrade your system, repeat. The story jobs are technically optional, which lets you do other jobs in between (and earn more money which is nice), but you'll run out of other things to do eventually.Unlike some of the more recent games it inspired, Uplink's totally 1337 haxoring is mainly GUI-based - which means clicking all the things - although knowing how to use a command prompt will still help a lot. Once you know what you're doing, the initially rather steep difficulty curve levels out pretty fast, but half the fun comes from pushing yourself as far as you can without screwing up anyway.The biggest problem with Uplink is the lack of variety. It's more fun if you play it in bite-size chunks or have an appetite for grinding, because unless you can find a way of stealing wads of cash or robbing a bank or something, that's what you'll be doing initially to get the gear you need.The typing field UI is also quite finicky, which is anathema to a game centered around...you know, computer hacking. It's not immediately clear that you need to tab to a field to type in it, which is necessary because merely mousing over it only activates the field for as long as your mouse is over it.Uplink's game world is also relatively small in scope for what's supposed to be a corporate subsection of the World Wide Web, but hey, it's a mild dystopia. And also an indie game from 2001. These guys were literally pressing disks in their house to start. That's worthy of respect, if nothing else.Recommended if you're a GIANT NERD like me.			"

												This game though it is cheap to buy is worth way more than it's price. I would have to say that this is one of the best games in my Steam library. first off when you get into the game there is a tutorial that helps teach you how to do the basics and then after the three parts to the tutorial you get left to do whatever you want to do. I also like how the game is based off of some real hacking concepts such as jumping from point to point to make tracing you harder and having to delete your logs on one of the computers in the chain as to not get your gateway caught. I reccomend this game to anyone who is into hacking.			"

												Uplink has been a favorite game of mine since the first day I played it, and I've been playing it off and on through the years since it first came out.  There's something about the atmosphere in the game that is so intense, and which raises your primal senses.  Nothing quite comes close to the satisfaction this game provides of making a good hack while the tracer beep is going crazy, then disconecting to hear a peaceful soundtrack again, uninterrupted by any incoming mails about what you just did.  But not for long, because now the race is on to fix server logs elsewhere...  I've never actually beat Uplink, yet. But over the years I've learned what I need to do, and I'm getting closer.  For me this game is kind of like a fine wine, good in moderation, and leaves me satisfied every time.Highly reccomended if you're up for a unique game, and want to take the role of a hacker on the invisible net!*owned long before steam10/10			"

With the money you can buy or upgrade hardware, making things easier. There are more than enough missions to choose from, so you're not constantly doing the same thing (well, you ARE doing the same stuff in theory, but there's just enough variation to keep things a little bit fresh).

												Two thumbs way up on this one!  You'll love it, you'll hate it, you'll feel evil.  Great game!I have played this game for a much longer time than my time on Steam indicates.  I first found out about this game on the abandonware site ""Home of the Underdogs"", which is still up and running and worth taking a look at.  Anyway, Uplink caught my eye as being one of the ""Top Dogs"" and in the Hall of Fame.I completely agree with that evaluation.Some of the people who are reading this may remember playing the game ""Hacker"" by Activision about 30 years ago.  That game was intriguing as there was no intro screen, nothing, just a blank blue screen requiring you to log in to a system you've hacked into.Uplink is the Hacker of a new generation, but exponentially better.  If you are not familiar with the world of hacking or even how basic modern computer systems work (and I am one of those people), then the learning curve may be high.  But once mastered, the game is a thrill and a sh*t-ton of fun.You don't have to follow the narrative story that the game puts in front of you.  There are always more missions available that don't move the plot forward.  If fact, I found the essential ""sandbox"" piece of the game more fun than the ""story-mode"".This game allows you to experience the complete psycopathy that a hacker can posess without having to risk the alternatives, such as decades in a federal prison.  You can use your powers for good if you want to.  But I think that it's clear, in movies and in literature going back centuries -- being evil is more fun.  So take that mission to break into a competitor's server and disrupt it.  Or steal their files and erase it even when you aren't being paid to.  There are several ""headlines"" that appear on the home screen that give you a nice little chuckle to let you know you've succeeded.Eventually, the sandbox mode (like with all sandbox modes) loses its challenge.  THis is because you've mastered everything, bought every possible piece of computer equipment and security pieces, and have hacked banks so many times that you have so much money and don't need any more.But that's like every game.  Just in writing this review it gave me motivation to return to this game after a couple of years.  Sorry if I take your bank down.  Trust me, they deserved it.  Or not.			"

												Great Game with great potencial :) GG  / This game is old but i like it because its have lot of ways to have fun 1. if you are bored and dont know what to do just take a look at News you can see what happend in the world (ingame)and when you just hack into one of the Goverment systems and you wil change something you will see in news ""Hackers Attack on Bla bla bla "" or something like that.2. When i start play this game i didnt understand what to do, because its have small tutorial - this is bad but this tutorial was helpful :) and when you dont know something just take a look into guides what you can find on Internet or on Steam3.I want Uplink 2 :D now! :D 4.You think this game dont have a story??? ha! its have! but you will need to be a ""Big Hacker""..... But when you sometimes take a look into News (ingame) you will can find some news about other hackers what they done and whats happend to them .. and bla bla bla just this game is good but need sequel :D PLSSS introversion plsss make it 5 Okey i am lazy to write it all :D (GG) sorry for my english i am only 15 years old boy :) PS: Better is when you will bought Introversion Complete Pack :) thats all thanks  for this game :D i love  it!

												This game is one of the best things I have ever accidentaly bought.When I purchased Prison Architect, another great game, the only DLC I really wanted was the Name in Game. However, to get this I had to buy a more exensive pack. This pack contained Uplink.Uplink is not a casual game, neither is it competitive. It is a challenge. Failure is met with a complete wipe of your save file, unless you're cheeky enough to copy it from the Uplink folder. However, ultimate success is met with extreme satisfaction. You'll not beat the game on your first run. Neither on your second, third or fourth. When you lose, you MUST learn from your mistakes and think ""How did I mess up this time?"" Eventually, you'll hack that bank and steal millions. Eventually, you'll find the secret of compromising that Local Area Network. Eventually, you will succeed in your final quest, whether you side with good or bad, Arunmor or ARC, Faith or Revelation.TL;DRThis game is a brilliant, tense and puzzling hacking simulator. I sincerely recommend it.If that doesn't sound too good, you can force people into jail for having a short ❤❤❤❤			"

												Now, if you don't know anything about this game and you want some information about it. But the only reviews you're seeing are one-liners, typed by overly excited gamers with only 0.2 -1.3 hours of play on the record. And they didn't play this game since the first startup. Despite the fact that it's looks suspicious they are right. Most of this guys played the game back in the day. Yep, the game is old, yep from 2001.So let me explain about this game. If you want constant heroic action, glorifying to save the world and a lovely evening with Cara Delevingne at the end of the game. Sorry mate, wrong game. This is a hacking simulator. The first and probably the best computer hacking simulator up to this day. Absolute classic.You are buying and downloading the Uplink client to your computer. The program(a.k.a the game) makes automatic connection with the Uplink Corporation servers. After a simple registration the corporation will provide to you a remote access to a static computer gateway somewhere in the world and a small loan for initial costs. With all 24/7 support and constant access to hardware and software upgrades. The only thing you must do is to cover your costs: your monthly gateway fee and upgrade purchases. And to HACK.If you didn't realise until now, you smug, the game is not real, even if it feels otherwise. That's the idea to feel real. The game is single-player and don't have any multiplayer or online capabilities. Except for the in-game IRC client(sadly no one is using it these days) you can talk with other real live hackers(gamers) about hacking solutions and tips or about girls and boobies. Now, I advise to find some old-school notebook walkthroughs on the Internet about the hacks. Google and search for them like a real hacker. If you think that the tips about this game will make the game easier and not challenging.... well.... let's just say that, even with all the help you can get, there is nothing more terrifying than a black screen. The old-school players knows... it hurts .... in the chest.What to say, more?Buy it. Play it. This game, deserves it.			"

												This is a fun, fairly simplified and slightly futuristic computer hacking adventure. The game does have an interesting storyline and allows for some open play on the side if you don't feel ready to tackle the story missions. Like stealing a ton of money from people's bank accounts, for instance, then enjoying the feeling of paranoia that comes afterward.This is still my favorite game done by Introversion and it even has a mysterious ""game bible"" collection that you can obtain outside of the game which is mostly concept art and notes relating to the game's production. It's cool side-project-thing if you want to investigate but completely unnecessary to fully enjoy the game.			"

												Uplink was one of the best games I ever played and also the best hacker simulation I have seen so far. Made by famous Introversion Software it is also the first game they made.I really like the way hacking is simulated here (no need to type in the same stupid commands over and over again), the depth of the story, the possibilities the game gives you, the way the interface works and the eastereggs and humor within the game. In the original version there were also things hidden outside of the game, e.g. on the CD, the bonus disk and the manual. man ""Uplink Game Bible"".As my dev-CD of Uplink broke some years ago I seized the chance to get a working Uplink via the steam sale again. Unfortunately the Multi-Monitor option is not available in the steam version of the game and cannot be activated (which can be done in the original version although it was officially removed there, too). Playing Uplink on several screens (all showing different game-related data) is even more movie-hackerish.			"

												This game has some things it gets right, and they turn out fun, like the strategy aspects of having to map out a communication line to not get caught, or basic mechanics that make you feel like you are actually doing what the game sets out to show itself as.  It's fun, if you like a lot of multitasking you have to pay attention to, in order to succeed. However, like some other reviewers said, the novelty does get a little weak, relatively early in the game.  The upgrade system is nice, but from what I saw, everything has the order or same linear pattern in which you go about using the items you buy, as well as the effectiveness levels of upgrades just seeming to extend their efficacy.  The worst part about the game, and the reason I do not recommend it, is the lack of game instruction.  You get a pretty crappy tutorial setup, that keeps raising questions, especially coupled with the fact that I was constantly failing some missions, where I have to delete the file before claiming the mission was complete, in which case I would end up deleting the file only to find out, I did it in the incorrect order, and would have to do it all over again.

												You'll be two hundred and seventy six hours into the game, with millions in your bank account (after robbing them all) with the knowledge of every Uplink agent's real name under your belt and a computer virus that could wipe out the internet itself.By that time, you'll have destroyed every mega-corporation's mainframe twice, saved the Internet and sent half of the people on Earth to jail for domestic terrorism. The other half you'll have given A's in cooking class.You've just spent a good chunk of your money upgrading to a super-computer, and decide to hack the government and see what sick loot you can find in their mainframe. You're in, and you find the secret to Uplink itself. Just as you're about to read it, your screen goes black. You've been disavowed by Uplink. You forgot to turn on your trace tracker.10/10 would get disavowed again. "

												Still one of the best sandbox hacking games out there. A ton of cyberpunk flavor and manages to provide a unique experience despite years after release. If you liked Hacknet or the hacking minigames with the recent Deus Ex games, Uplink provides more of that with more freedom and complexity. Also features a very fun plotline, intense moments and a very kicking radical soundtrack.For those looking for a core vanilla experience but with a modern flair, the recent Uplink OS mod also provides a nicely re-designed UI that feels very comfortable and intuitive to play the game with while maintaining the same great hacking experience the original game provided. http://www.moddb.com/mods/uplink-os "

												A very fun game that plays with the idea of ""Hollywood hacking"" and takes it to it's logical conclusion. Break into computers and change records, cover your tracks, upgrade your hardware and try not to get caught.Nice relaxing soundtrack combined with very tense moments as you rush to delete server logs before the trace catches up with youHowever, I do have a couple of complaints which make the game a lot less fun than it should be.Firstly, it's possible to miss the story, entirely. It's not just a sequence of random assignments, there is an ongoing story as well. But if you're not in the right situation at the right point in the game, you don't get the email which sets the plot in motion. Or, you could not read it, or you could get it but not be in a position (lack of money or equipment) to do it...in which case the game carries on regardless but with no objective.Secondly, once you reach the stage where you can break into banks and alter your account information, money effectively becomes meaningless in the game, so the challenge of raising funds to buy better hardware and software is entirely removed from the game...which takes away a large part of the game.Thirdly, you do seem very dependent on the RNG. You can be in a situation where the only jobs you're offered...you can't do because you don't have the equipment needed to complete them. And so...you just end up stuck with no way to raise money as you're no longer being offered jobs within your remit. The only way around this is to have the RNG be favourable, or be psychic and know in advance what equipment you're going to need.Fourthly, I really, really hate how if you have the pointer over a text entry field you're filling in....and you move the mouse outside the box..it automatically loses focus. Wouldn't be a huge issue if you weren't always racing against the clock, but it can be very frustrating.Fifthly, once you discover that InterNIC never, ever change their passwords and never run a trace, it becomes utterly trivial to avoid getting caught - all you have to do is make sure your connections run through them and delete the logs after each mission.Still, I do recommend it. It's fun to dip into and play for an hour or so at a time...but the aforementioned points do make it rather frustrating at times. Oh, and when you run at higher resolutions the text becomes absolutely tiny, rather than scaling to compensate.			"

												Uplink is a very interesting game that fills a much needed gap in genres. Hacking simulation games are rare, and this one fulfills that need beautifully. You are placed in front of a terminal from the very beginning. The tutorial helps you get started without any problems, and once you complete your first few missions, you will understand how to use the basics. The music gets a little repetitive after many hours of play, but does not become a distraction or an annoyance. If you prefer, you can turn it off in the settings. The complexity of Uplink comes from the various missions as well as the many hardware and software changes and upgrades you are allowed to make. Some of the early missions can be a bit confusing, but after a few tries you realize what you did wrong, and will be able to complete them without any problems. The setting of the game is somewhat futuristic but manages to keep facts into perspective as well as keeping all aspects of the game realistic for such a simulation. There is much reading to be done in the form of bulletin boards, viewing items, and reading mission details. Making the video resolution too high will make the fonts too small to read, which makes things tough for the eyes. As the difficulty of the missions ramp up, you are basically left on your own to figure out how the game works, and what you need in order to be able to attempt missions. This can be frustrating and can possibly leave the player feeling almost completely lost. It is often very difficult to understand what tools one needs for the various jobs you have access to, or how to go about correcting some of your mistakes. I suppose Uplink is keeping its simulation genre up to standard, as a real life hacker would probably go through the same hurdles and difficulties for learning about such activities, which can certainly take much time and many errors to master. Getting caught, losing everything, and being forced to end your career early as a hacker is heartbreaking, and gives the impression that you are playing a roguelike. Getting help from a FAQ or guide is almost a requirement. As you complete the missions, you rarely feel safe. It almost feels like at any time, you will get caught and have to restart the game with a brand new character again. The more advanced missions are so complicated, involved in minute details, and difficult to complete, that I don't think there is any way to go about them by trial and error. Once again, a FAQ or guide is an absolute necessity. Worse yet, if you make a ridiculously small mistake in the very first part of the story mission, you will have to start over from the very beginning if you want to do more than the non crucial missions and proceed through the storyline. The player is not allowed to save and reload games at all. Starting from the beginning multiple times because of small mistakes means that you will be throwing away dozens of hours until you get it right even once. This problem of having to restart the game from the very beginning, in conjunction with the lack of variety in the missions makes for somewhat of a disappointment. Even then, Uplink can be enjoyed in short bursts, and is a good choice to go back to every now and then, by keeping it installed for the long run. It is also valid to mention that for its age, Uplink has accomplished plenty. It is a complex and complicated hacking simulation to be enjoyed by those who are patient and don't mind a steep learning curve.Uplink is okay.			"

												Fantastic hacking game, really gives that late 90's feel as well. However, after you've figured out how to hack into a bank and transfer a few hundred grand to yourself, the game is cake. I'd love to see a report on how you were caught if you are, and, what steps the game's AI took to track and catch you.  "

												In its very minimalistic and clean way, Uplink delivers one of the best (if not the best) hacking simulation ever in a game. You start in your gateway: a believable desktop-like screen where you run your apps, manage your missions and connect to the internet through a worldmap. With limited processing power, bandwidht and low grade softwares at first, you must finish missions from dozens of companies to earn money and improve your Uplink ranking, unlocking more challenging and dangerous missions as well as an improving all hardware, software and security at your Gateway.  From destroying and stealing sensitive data, recording voice patterns, decyphering algorithms, decrypting files, compromising LAN networks, completely crippling complex and high-top secure systems, Uplink creates a level of immersion and atmosphere that is rarely seen in any other of the genre, much due to its soundtrack that nails at setting the right mood.  Whatever you choose to be: a white hat hacktivist or a blackhat sworn to end all data , there's no do overs: once caught, good riddance. No Load Game in Uplink, which is the cherry on the top of a well crafted cake. Must have for the genre fans.			"

												4/5 ""Fantastic"" **** You may not have ever heard of this game before. Well in short it is a hacking simulator with late 80's style soundtrack and feel. The game is so immersive, many stories have been shared of how others mistook the game for a real program, and raised concerns. If you have ever wanted to be a hacker, and experience that rush you must pick this up. But be warned the game does not do a good job at explaining itself, and many tricks of the trade will go right over your head. I recommend looking up some playthroughs to learn how to play and be a better hacker.			"

												If you're into Hollywood-action movie style hacking, then this game is definitely for you. If you are a real life hacker, I guess you'll be better off just doing things IRL. One major issue: this game is a pain in the ♥♥♥ if you have a huge (by 2001's standards) monitor, because fonts become fuzzy/small and totally unreadable. This makes this game unplayable, which is really unfortunate, because it is enjoyable.If you want it, you'd better get a relatively small monitor which you can look at from close. Since I have a Full HD monitor now, that's not happening with me.			"

Can you copy and paste them? Nope. Couldn't they just make you instantly lose some money? wouldn't that be easier and less tedious?

Given the great things other people have said about this game I forced myself to come back and give the game another chance. I continued to grind through the tedium of this game. I could only manage one or two hacks at a time before the idea of blankly staring at the wall became more appealing than carrying on. I clocked up a total of 2 and a half hours playing this game and I still hadn't got to the start of the plot or found anything enjoyable in the game.

I know nothing about the whole art, and I’m sure this game (as a game should) makes hacking an easy and fun activity, but dear god this game is complicated to a gamer joe like myself. I don’t know if it’s the rudimentary old-school user interface, or if it’s the massive amount of info dumped on you in the first 5 minutes alone, but after making it through the tutorial and taking my first job my brain was done. I think there is absolutely a niche audience who would lose weeks to this kind of game, but it is definitely not for the feint of heart.			"

												While I enjoyed the game, it is not something that I can recommend to others.  The game may be rather dated, but it is not quite the reason why I can't recommend it to others; the gameplay is.In Uplink, you play as a hacker working for an organisation that takes on shady requests such as data theft, data destruction, data alteration, or just looking at sensitive information and relaying it to the client, among others.  While the premise sounds fun, when you actually start playing it, you will discover that there are a lot of information that you have to remember, to the point where you have to record it somewhere (like in a notepad or in your phone).  Early missions are easy and don't require you to record much of any information anywhere.  When you get to the harder missions, that's when you start having to record a lot of information, and the game becomes tedious.  I don't mind doing it, but I doubt others are as receptive of the gameplay when it starts to resemble a day job (even I only play it once in a while for short periods of time, if only to make it worth the money I paid for it).  It also involves a lot of reading, and I'm told that people don't like to do that as much either (especially people from my country, who apparently only read 2 books per year on average).			"

												An awesome idea, and I remember how I thought it was ground-breaking when it originally came out in, what was it, 2001?This is a hacking simulator. You install software and upgrade your machine to be better at hacking and to protect yourself from server owners who try to track your signal.Unfortunately, it's too easy to get yourself into a deadlock. Too easily you can delete server nodes that you really really need to use to connect to your victim's, and too easily you can get stuck with missions that are too high level for you to even start.This game needs a modern refresh.

												Uplink is almost a purely textbased game, in which you play a hacker. The tasks you perform are always the same but more unlock as you climb the ladder. Unfortunately, there aren't that many different missions so gameplay is quite repetitive. Not to mention, there's no real story and it lacks a great sense of accomplishment for completing jobs. Uplink isn't for everyone, but if you're still up for it and have money to throw, be my guest.			"

												Perhaps my overly high hopes for this game made me overly bitter about playing it.  I mean, how bad could it really be?Immersion and gameplay -After completing the tutorial mission, I wondered, ""Ok, now what?""  There is no plot (zero, none, nothing, NULL) to this single player game which begs the question, ""Why am I playing this?""  You will spend your first few hours going mission to mission using the exact same password crack, browse files, delete logs.  Over.  And over.  And over...  Then there's the constant BEEP, BEEP, BEEP.  It makes the game tense because you feel like your teeth are getting drilled.  And just like in real life, you have an email inbox full of auto-replies and junk that you have to try and sort through trying to find the file name your supposed to look for on the stupid repetative mission while BEEP BEEP BEEP!!!!!!!!!!Audio visual atmosphere - The audio and visuals of the game are non-existant.  You'll tell yourself ""that's ok, because I play all kinds of indie 8-bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.""  Just don't.  Please.Controls -I would describe this game as OS hell.  The interface is absolute torture. If you actually do any programming, scripting, hacking, or even just know your way around a real OS, the fact that you CANNOT ACTUALLY USE THE KEYBOARD most of the time will make you want to immediately delete this game.  Instead you have to click around through the minimalist interface of indeciferable buttons.  Image everything you hate about computers, ok, now step in a pile of dog ♥♥♥♥, and that should get you in the ball park of what this game is like.  Summary -It's like your parents asked you to fix their computer, you know, find the ""funny email thing"" they downloaded 10 times but can't find it, only you have to use the mono-chromatic interface from a Nokia brick phone circa 1999 while some one is shreiking in your ear periodically and hitting you in the balls wiht a hockey stick.  If you are still thinking you want to play this game, just go put your head in an oven, and slam the door repeatedly whilst the broiler is turned on.			"

												I just... I can't really get into this or call it ""fun"". It's... staring at an ugly computer screen and reading tiny font trying to find info you want. Also there's a bit too harsh of a penalty for failure in some circumstances (which can be avoided by backing up your save often, but.)I don't really have the drive to play it any more that I have, though. There's not much variety in the tasks and far too much busywork. It's almost like an RPG in the sense that you have to perform repetitive tasks to ""gain skill"" arbitrarily and be able to progress. That might explain why I don't enjoy it. I'm sure there's an audience for this. But I have too many other more interesting games I could be playing besides this one, and no interest in wasting further time on this.			"

The chance of being tracked as your rob a bank blind and apprehended by police is a rush all its own. The interface can be confusing at first, but an encompassing tutorial quickly familiarises you, and you're hacking your way into secure networks before long. An excellent game.			"

												A very big suprise when I first played it. I last had such an addiction to a game when I played Civ 2 and that must count for something. What I so love about this Game is, that you are completly free in all your doing. You can hack or do whatever you want in this game, it doesnt matter if its a Mission or something of that sort. You really got the impression that you have a whole world to conquer and not some sort of tube to follow.Warning!If you new to computer or Networks and this stuff you will get some Problems with this game, because it requires certain knowledge to a lesser degree (e.g. what a Proxy or a log is).

												This is one of those games that shouldn't be fun. The premise is boring, this idea that you're a hacker sitting at home taking on assignments just so you can upgrade your equipment to take on more assignments. BUT it's surprisingly addictive. It's very easy to mess up and have to start from scratch, but that's just part of playing the game and makes it feel like the stakes are much higher. It's a good one for when you're bored but don't have the energy to run around kicking ♥♥♥.			"

												Uplink is a text based computer hacking strategy game. And it's great. You get a real sense of urgency when you are trying to delete your digital footsteps whilst the company you are hacking is tracing you.

												I played. I lost. So I played again, using all of the skills I had gained the first time. Then I lost. Rinse and repeat.Uplink is tough as nails, yet that just makes it more fun. You have to be so careful, so precise, because forgetting to erase a single access log entry can get you caught. The amount of stress involved in each hack, the sheer panic as I hope I crack the password before I get traced feels incredible. The 'atmosphere' (or whatever passes for it in a game made up of menus) is perfect because the game never even admits to being a game. From the moment you log into the game, it feels like you're actually a movie hacker sitting down with your tools, like a young Angelina Jolie preparing to hack the Gibson.One problem some people might have with the game is that it's very clumsy and difficult to use the interface, and many of the tasks are repetitive. I personally liked that aspect, because there's something great about having to go through the routine every time, knowing that one mistake could be your last. Complacency is your greatest enemy. Besides, the game is about tension, and having to fight against your own tools to optimise heightens that. It also leads to interesting decisions. Should you open your hacking programs one by one, losing precious time in menus? Or should you keep all of your programs running before the hack, but deal with the increased CPU load? By far, the most annoying thing is routing your connection through as many servers as possible before each hack, but at least you can save and load your relays to save time. Still, for me, the difficulty of using the interface adds more realism, as if I'm actually hacking. Things can't all be fun and games when you play a game that's not a game.One thing I really would love to see, though, is hotkeys. It makes sense that a game based around a computer terminal would have hotkeys for everything. Other than that, this is a splendid game that I have never won, or even come close to winning. I just keep playing because it's that good. Oh, and did I mention there's also a spectacular (if short) soundtrack?			"

												Introversion made a few games before Prison Architect. This is their first. Even to this day (since 2003) this has a huge cult following. Sure the portayal of the actual ""hacking"" is a joke, but they wanted to capture the essence of power and choice the role could provide in gaming, and capture they did. I can recall pelenty a time when I nervously waiting for the password breaker to work its magic before a bank finished it trace, or the jubelation when I was sucessful and cleared every account and deleted the records of the money and how the hack would go to the news in-game. This should be in every gamer's library.			"

												This game is essential for anyone that's into cyberpunk stuff. You play as a computer hacker, and it's your job to hack just about everything. There's a good variety of side-missions alongside a relatively short campaign. The side-missions involve things like disabling systems, changing criminal records, and getting bank account details.There's one type of side mission where a person will receive a large amount of money. The mission briefing tells you to get this person's name. However, if you have the proper tools, you can hack that person's account and take the money (usually above 500k credits) for yourself. The game gets a lot easier after doing so, since you can buy just about everything after doing it once or twice......But on the flip side, it's super cool that you can hack a bank to get more money. That's the great thing about this game. You get to pick your own course of action without any hand-holding.And there's a functioning IRC client built into the game. 11/10 GOTYAY			"

												For those of you in the IT sector, if you're looking for a good hacking sim, don't go with Hacker Evolution - just get this. It's more realistic and it'll run on just about any computer you throw at it, especially if you cut the interface animations, etc. So if you reeeeeeally need a computer upgrade, you can probably still play this. In fact, it worked on an ancient Dell Lattitude D400. It's pretty straightforward: get a mission, hack into a computer, do what they tell you, clear your tracks, get out, clear your tracks some more, move on to the next mission. Just don't forget to clear your tracks, or you'll lose all of a sudden a couple days later and not know why. This game is pretty satisfying if you don't get caught. Remember to make a copy of the users folder in Steam! There's no actual save feature to bail you out when you lose. Kinda like real life.			"

												Paranoia : the game.Basically a hacking simulation. Don't expect it to be realist, it looks like Hollywood hacking rather than real hacking. Or at least I guess, I never hacked anyone. And taking over someone's Facebook account because the password was 12345 is NOT hacking.But I digress. That pretty is pretty good, even through sometimes, despite how much you covered your tracks, the AI will still manage to track you down, because it's the plot, and thou cannot avoid it.But let's list all the good points :-lot of freedom-multiple endings-it's possible to send people in prison for no reason-it's possible to have someone arrested for ""arson, murder, and he fapped to lolis""-you WILL become paranoid-gives a basic idea of how the Internet's like.-TUT... TUT... TUT... TUT TUT TUTUTUTUTUTUTUT.The cons:-some missions are not simple, and sometimes, even through you think the mission is completed, you'll be forced to retry again because you forgot one thing.-the framing missions are complicated.-once you know how to do, the whole game can be a walk in the park. Especially the bank robbing thing.-the AI is pretty dumb. People never get suspicious when a guy named Ed Robinson suddenly becomes wanted for downloading CP, breaking paroles and repeating ""ANONYMOUS WILL LIVE"", even through they know that the global criminal database was compromised. And when the society he was working for is suddenly attacked and infected with viruses, they don't think of releasing him.-it may be difficult to read the small fonts.But the game itself is fun. You really feel like you can take on anyone on Earth. There are mods, too.I'm sorry, Ed Robinson. You were just too efficient and too hard-working.			"

I didn't think I'd like it as much as I do, but nothing feels more epic than sitting in front of the game and pretending that I'm actually hacking into these databases.I'm not gonna lie, the game starts out hard, and then procedes to get more difficult. It's almost as though the tiny world contained within the game evolves with you, and becomes more intelligent really quickly.I typically wouldn't reccomend a hacking simulator to many people, but Uplink is good. Anybody can sit down and play it with a minimal understanding of how to use their computer.Knowledge required? How to use your mouse, and how to type. No coding, just your name. Uplink? It's good.

												This is one of my all time favorite titles, ever! Uplink places you in the position of an 'agent' who works anonymously through the Uplink corporation. Uplink's purpose is to provide corporations with acces to anymous hackers, who can be hired, for a fee, to perform digital tasks such as espionage, stealing data, shutting down mainframes, and various other tasks. You will encounter a world full of firewalls, proxies, passwords, voice prints, elliptic curve ciphers, and even penetrate through LANs to find your target system. Earn money, buy impressive upgrades, like faster processors, more storage, and even bigger and better gateways that can support multiple processors, massive amounts of memory, and blazingly fast connection speeds. The hacking is very stylized and 'faked out', so don't go thinking it'll teach you how to hack into your sister's pc so you can find her prom pictures for posting on the internet. Nevertheless, this game rocks.While this title is quite old now, with dated graphics, and dated concepts, it is still a marvelous game, well executed, and far ahead of it's time.

												Hollywood hacking, the game. The learning curve starts off not too bad, then goes pretty steeply up, then levels back off once you figure everything out. There's not too much to it, but pay attention and a small storyline opens up that puts pretty much everything at risk and leaves it to you to decide what to do.All in all, this is a great game to kill a bit of time with, especially if you're without internet access for some reason. A word of advice, if I may? Robbing banks is extremely hard to do, but totally worth it, so try and figure out how to do that. Other than that, just screw around.

												Never has a game so captured the atmosphere, the mythos, the feel of the cracker realm. It is not a simple game. It is a game of extreme rigor. Of meticulous planning. Of method. Though you will not learn to crack, you will learn to hide behind proxies, to erase logs, to fabricate evidence. Reality will bend under your fingers as you type onto your keyboard. And as you delve deeper and deeper, you will start to see the world you live in differently.You'll start to realise how much we've become dependent. How everything runs through the network, everything is connected. And how easily some things, in the grand mesh of connectivity, can be altered, lost, stolen.After all, they are all but numbers. Try to change them.			"

												In Uplink you're a hacker, and you're part of an organization (guess what it's called) whose customers want illegal stuff done, which is where you come in - you fiddle with bank accounts, CVs, etc. You get paid for the jobs, and you can then use the money to buy software or hardware to improve your rig (you have an in-game PC that you use for illegal activities). In most jobs you have a certain time to finish whatever you're doing, or you'll get traced, and your save file is lost if you get caught. You also have to cover up your tracks or you'll get caught eventually (a day or two after the job).Pros: Lots of pressure during the jobs, this game can really get your heart beating; It's fun to upgrade your rig; Good difficulty; Complex jobs; MAJOR PRO: There is freedom in this game, you can hack any company in the phonebook, you can hack into a bank and make yourself rich, you can give yourself a masters degree in Astrophysics, you can shut down hackers, ruin random peoples lives, make them rich, etc.Cons: Can get boring, because although there are a few different types of jobs, they get repetitive since jobs in the same category are pretty much identical.Neutral/Subjective: Pretty hardcore game, your save is lost for good if you mess up (you can back it up by going to the save folder, but if you don't, you're back to the beginning of the game); Requires patience.Conclusion: If you're patient, cool with text based games, and like hacking (not Watch_Dogs ""hacking"", proper hacking - although of course this game doesn't teach you how to hack, there are firewalls, proxies, etc., you're doing more than just mashing one button to ""hack""), then this game was made for you, buy it. If the theme doesn't appeal to you much, maybe get it on sale, it might surprise you.For some reason I am not capable of giving games an X/10 review, so yeah... Either way, it's good, definitely recommend it unless you are incapable of playing anything but action games.			"

												If you liked the Deus Ex HR hacking minigame, this is like a much-elaborated-on version of that.  It's essentially hollywood hacking: the game, and is surprisingly fun, and very immersive.  You've got the standard ""do missions to afford upgrades to do harder missions"" gameplay, but there's also a larger storyline you can follow with a moral choice and everything.  And of course you can just say screw it all, digitally rob a bank, and go shutting down the computers of whoever you want and selling the identities of all your fellow hackers for money.			"

												A surprising little gem of a game, Uplink is complex but remarkably playable, and has a nicely variable 'pace' between careful research and planning for your next big hack, and the hurried racing against the clock to break through the target's defences before you get traced. Don't forget to cover your tracks, and whatever you do, do it from behind seven proxies. Good luck.			"

												In a nutshell, this is a great reproduction of those unrealistic Hollywood hacking scenes which lets you do some super cool ♥♥♥♥ and become a hacking god. This game requires trial and error and lots of time investment, but the rewarding feeling for finally figuring out how to get away with hacking bank accounts, or trace a rival hacker, find his identity, and modify police records to land his ♥♥♥ in jail is totally worth it. After about 6 hours and a few restarts, I've only conquered about 20% of what there seems to be, and the difficulty keeps rising. I love this game, though it eats a lot of time. Check out the wiki for some basic instruction,(the in game tutorial is lacking), but I wouldn't recommend looking at how to do the harder missions, that ruins the point.			"

												This is a great game, and one you can keep picking up after you finish it. It's best described as a ""Hollywood hacking simulator,"" and once you get past the learning curve it's the most fun you'll ever have staring at a terminal.You're a computer hacker working for the Uplink Agency. You take jobs ranging from data theft to falsifying records to robbing banks. All of this is done through a GUI/text interface that will fully immerse you in the experience of ""hacking."" Due to the nature of the game, it has aged quite well for having been released in 2001: its graphics are simply as good as they need to be. A few gripes: The interface could be smoother and more intuitive. The missions do become a bit repetitive once you get the hang of them. And the whole game becomes incredibly easy once you know how to rob banks. But these are just small problems with an otherwise solid game.			"

												Uplink is one of those games that hooks you from the word go. Simple to play but with increasing levels of challenge which give the game longevity, follow a storyline throughout the game or challenge yourself to conquer certain areas. The addition of LANs added great variety to the game (Deus Ex seems to have nicked the idea for the hacking in that).			"

												It's just amazing how addictive Uplink can still be years after I first played it. Your first playthrough will be punishing and rewarding at the same time. Punishing, because the mistakes you make can bite you in the ♥♥♥ later on and get your account suspended. That means you'll have to restart with a new one! But it is also very rewarding to see that you can complete the same tasks that took you so long the first time around so much faster on your second try. The game shows you that you have become better. Many details make this a really great experience, such as seeing news appear on the server you recently hacked, the many easter eggs and even the storyline. Once you're at a level where you can hack LANs and banks, this is where this game really shines. After you got really rich though, it loses lots of appeal. This is about 8-10 hours in. On your first playthrough it's probably more like 15-20 hours in. Remember to replay one year later, it'll be just as fun again!			"

												This game might be old, but it still is a great game after all those years, I still recommend it. I did not notice it arrive on Steam, most of my game time was off of Steam or in a standalone Improvement Pack called ""Onlink"".Everything functions as it should, however some features would be nice to have, like by the CPU-Allocation having a max-min button instead of pressing the increase-decrease button multiple times. However, that is just something minor.The story is alright, it's nothing ground-breaking, but the game shinies in its mechanic in my opinion.			"

												Uplink is a classic ""hacker"" game with cool story and mechanics.Despite the fact it came out a while ago, it still probably one of the defining games in the genre, perfectly recreating that feel people used to get back when internet access was a privilige, not a commodity.You dive into the world of unknown, and learn to ""hack"" into various systems, and slowly learn about overarching plot luring you to some interesting missions that will test the knowledge you got.On top of all that, developers made source-code of Uplink available to developers, leading to creation of some interesting mods, including online version of the game.I strongly recommend this game for all fans of the genre.

												Uplink might not be the most accurate hacking simulator out there but it certainly is the most fun. The progression system in the form of hardware and software upgrades provides quite a few branching options as different missions require different software to complete. The game fuses high tension gameplay and a well executed theme into a blast of a time for anyone even remotely interested in 'hacking'.Uplink was released quite some time ago but don't worry about having difficulties playing due to outdated graphics and interface as there are numerous mods which greatly help on that front. Personal recommendation:  Uplink OS Perhaphs the only complaints I could levy against the game would be the fact that the game forces you into participating in the main storyline and that missions can start feeling like a grind after a while.Do yourself a favour and grab it if you can.

												I think Uplink is overall a good game but it does have it's problems the good aspects are as follows*Good Gameplay*Amazing ways on how to handle each situation*Hacking Simulator FTW*Some pretty deep moral choices*And fun optional stuff to do on your own free timeHowever there is problems and I have a few to share and here are my problems with this game*Single-player only* no funn time with your friends this is a very good game that I wish they optimized multiplayer on. Hell even a mod would work.*One life progress loss/Lack of diffaculty settings* Alow me to explain I played for 8 hours on end and failed ONCE and lost all my progress and had to restart and I can say this for everyone that it sucks to lose alot of progress and though this a hacking simulator to mimic real life hacking then I relly wish they would have included diffaculty settings other then the diffaculty they set you in like Easy for beginners or somthing so when you fail it is not to much loss to stop a regular or new player like myself to put down the game permenantly or for a long time so it is a bad draw back in my opinion hell even the option to go back to a previous save on the easy non existant diffaculty would be nice so players of all kind can enjoy the game.*Passive Traceing* while ingame hacking you need to make sure to eliminate all evidence of hacking or they will passively trace you i wish they let you buy somthing so you don't get passively traced as often as some new players may not get the gist of how to elimnate evidence as well as it is redundent to go to the same place after every hack to eliminate evidence hell even that is not enough sometimes the problem with this is it can get alittle annoying for new and long time players just doing the same thing over and over again but i will not go to much on this one as it is not as bad as i am makeing it sound just get into a pattern and you will be fine with some experiance of course* somewhat unfinished* when i look at the game i feel like they where going to add more settings and equipment but did not get the chance to do so like look at the gate way security only 2 security features even though it shows a list i feel like they where going to add more but never got the chance oh well problems can occure and the game is ok with me in its current conditionOverall the game seems ok but it is not recommended for people who don't like perma death and a steep learning curve at times i will give the game a 8/10 it has it's problems but anyone can enjoy the game*EDIT* Oh boy has it been a while since I wrote this review and do I have some intresting things to tell you time for me to tell you some stuff you can do if you are haveing some problems with this game or do not like somthng about this game. Well this edit I will explain stuff that will make this game more enjoyable as it will let you enjoy the game with less worry of data loss and of course community DLC that will expand the game alowing newer and more seasoned players to continue enjoying this game or even get more enjoyment out of it. Now time for me to re explain thisMakeing a Perma death Safty Net/Backup Saveing: This one was a big problem I stated in my Original Review is you can't stop loseing progress if you got caught in game because developers where in my opinion where basterds for not includeing a setting to turn the perma death thing off or include save functionality alow me to revaluate perma death. In binding of isacc or a game like that where perma death is included it is useally made to be done in runs. You do a run in the game until you die or succssed and then you do another one, even FTL or Faster then light also did this that is what I expect out of those games as you are suppose to do them in runs. let me get another example MInecraft problably one of THE biggest Sandbox survival game that started the trend of sandbox survival has purmadeath if you die in the game you lose all your items but if you have cheats on you can turn that off aswell also you can recollect them if you go back to where you died but be quick as they will despawn after some time. AND minecraft even had a hardcore mode where you played the game in one life then you where forced to delete the world but the diffrence between that and uplink oh idk maybe it was a ♥♥♥♥ing option take notes devolpers think about the game you are makein then decide if you put perma death in it or make it an option or make a save system so data can be saved permantly geez. either way to circumvent this situation in piticular you can browse the local files of this game and locate the file named users there you will find notpads with your savedata name there are two files with the name of your profile and if your smart enough then you should know what I am about to say next. Select those files copy them and paste them into another file that is not in the games file's and vwella you have a backup if you ♥♥♥♥ up retire that save go into the files copy paste the backup into the user file and you can revert back to where you were. Sweet bliss to know your not gonna lose that data as developers where asshats and not givin ya a thing to not have to worry about it.*More Content* You can get more content thanks to the community gotta love the community to provide support for a game even if it is old the community has made DLC you can get and you launch it. keep in mind the dlc works not in conjunction but seprate from the main game it requires you to own the game to use it but they are not linked to eachother meaning there saves and data are not synced just keep that in mind when getting some DLC for uplink i recommend Onlink if your computer can run it. It is community DLC that you play and it has more content and such then the origianal alot more and with so many options and security systems you need to intercept, it makes it so much fun to play in generalOverall with this new info my New rateing for this game is a 9.5/10 the game still has some flaws but this new information makes this game a hell of alot more enjoyable then back then am i right :p			"

												This game has given me a bad itch that won't go away if I'm not playing it.There's something about this game, out of any other game in my Steam list that just NEEDS TO BE PLAYED.I'd kill to even see this on the PS Vita or 3DS, and not just Steam and the Android Market (Specifically the Tablet market only.)But I must say, this is one game that I can't stop playing, and always seem to have to learn something new when it comes to different systems you have to hack, jobs you have to pull off, and trying to be an Uber-Skilled bad ♥♥♥♥ when you rob a bank, which NEVER gets old.Recommended for anyone that wants a somewhat pretty great dive into what it might be like to be a hacker, I doubt it's truly like this, but God, I wish it was... but at least I have Uplink.

												I've been playing text games since that's all there was. So when I saw this up for sale, a long while back, I couldn't have cared less about the lack of graphics. Honestly, graphics would only ruin this game. It's a hacking game. It's a break your way into someone's system, or network, then steal, alter, or break whatever your mission calls for, get out clean, get paid and buy upgrades. Breaking in can be a challenge, but even more so is making sure to cover your tracks so no one catches you, all of which becomes increasingly difficult as go progress. Do I like this game? Absolutely. I've gladly started this game over dozens of times after being busted for not covering my tracks, or not getting out of a system before they traced me.If you're into increasingly difficult puzzle games, and the idea of being a hacker, this is the game for you. If not, try it anyways. It's a great game at a ridiculously cheap price.			"

												Uplink is a thoroughly enjoyable hacking simulator that will make anyone playing it feel like a one-person army. Send corporations scrambling as you leak critical information, change a person's history, steal cash from rich moguls, and break into high-security government mainframes. Above all, don't get caught.The game is heavily based on Hollywood's hackers, which makes the mechanics easy enough to learn in an afternoon while still providing the tension, cerebral challenge, and satisfaction of a good puzzle game. Combined with a cool interface, appropriate sound effects, an interesting storyline, and a great soundtrack, Uplink is very likely to be your next video game addiction.The only con is that the text is incredibly small at high resolutions and there is no good option for fixing that without lowering the resolution.

												A great little game in my opinion, and one of the few games I have found where hacking is exciting and interesting, or where you get access to an actual terminal and get to make actual choices rather than there simply being a 'hack' button. I got this cheap as part of a bundle and I'm so glad I stumbled across it, as I don't think I otherwise would have found it.However, this game can become a little repetitive as whilst there are many different mission types, within each category the missions are basically the same (hacking 1 bank is the same as hacking any other), however the late game missions have more variety, which leaves some replayability.Overall a great game if you like this kind of genre, and I hope to find more like it.

 I was recently looking for a game to spend my spare change on, and thanks to the Summer Sale, I was able to get Uplink.     The game is fairly difficult to originally get in to, but once you get the hang of it, Uplink becomes addicting. You take contracts to destroy/recover documents, track people's bank accounts, change their status on government documents, steal from banks, etc.    The game is a bit of a grind early on, but picks up pace after doing a few missions. This and the fact that if you  just look up and add all of the servers in the beginning, the game becomes fairly easy as you can bounce your connection between them all (effectively giving you a huge boost of time),  are the only faults I personally find with this game. For $5, this would be a great deal. But in it's current state it just isn't worth the $9.99 price tag. All in all, I give Uplink a 6.5/10 for it's current price, and 7.5/10 if it was a bit cheaper. There just isn't enough content for ten whole dollars.			"

												Extremely fun yet simplistic. The detail around what there is of the game is astounding, though the main story can be beaten in 4 hours. However the perma-death allows for rage and restarting. Watching the 2 different sides of the story unfold depending on your choice early on is great and adds for at least 1 more replay if not to endlessly hack. However, bare in mind that the evil side of the story condemns your agent to the game over screen, fail or succeed the last mission- the good ending leaves the game open to continue freelance hacking.Also recommended for movie buffs.

												This game is essential for anyone that's into cyberpunk stuff. You play as a computer hacker, and it's your job to hack just about everything. There's a good variety of side-missions alongside a relatively short campaign. The side-missions involve things like disabling systems, changing criminal records, and getting bank account details.There's one type of side mission where a person will receive a large amount of money. The mission briefing tells you to get this person's name. However, if you have the proper tools, you can hack that person's account and take the money (usually above 500k credits) for yourself. The game gets a lot easier after doing so, since you can buy just about everything after doing it once or twice......But on the flip side, it's super cool that you can hack a bank to get more money. That's the great thing about this game. You get to pick your own course of action without any hand-holding.And there's a functioning IRC client built into the game. 11/10 GOTYAY			"

You don't need to deal with actually advanced stuff, but it still keeps you in character and with the emotion of well, ♥♥♥♥ing things up.The realism in a sense may be good or bad, depending on how you like your games. You ♥♥♥♥ up here, you deal with it or start all over again.			"

												A pretty old game, but it's as they say.""Old But Gold"".At the start I was so confused, had no idea that to begin the actual Missions I would have to hack into the test server (I'm a dumbass).But after having my account terminated (many times) I learned to do better than on my last go,What I love about this game is that it's trial and error, no margin for mistakes.Any other game out there is like:Oh, you fell of a cliff that said ""Do not approach"", don't worry, come back from the checkpoint.In this game it's more like: Oh, you forgot to delete your logs in the InterNIC after a careful hack with no other traces>Sorrt m8, back you go lolol.

												I really want to like this game. i got it from the Introversion Pack during the summer sale, and decided to play it. At the price I got it for, it's really good. The problem is, its just so... boring. Every mission is so similar. But its a great concept. If you hant to make a hacking game, take a look at this. But I got it for 50 cents, so during a sale, I would reccomend it. Would benefit from varied gameplay (its basiclly use your Password Breaker, mabey run a Proxy Diable, change something, you're done). But I liked the 5 hours I played, and at the end of the day, I'd reccomend this,EDIT:During the time I played, I hadn't gotten to the story. I don't know anything about it, and the latest missions I've done were find finacial info. It may get better later on, idk.			"

												This is the original Hacknet. It's a little bit dated, but still lives up to its name as being one of the best hacking simulator games. I honestly really recommend this game. Uplink OS is a mod I highly recommend you get because it completely overhauls the UI and makes it a lot more usable for higher resolutions.TL;DR- buy this game. Don't be deterred by the age.

												It is game with great potential and pretty fun to play. However there are loads of details that are not vital for gameplay, but they are annoying.For example,  ip addresses: these are just random numbers, but from broken range (I usually got adresses like 842.274.407.350)Names of programs and warning/error messages are not corresponding to reality. (I got message like access denied by proxy.  I tried to change my proxy map so it will not use the broken one. Nope. You have to buy program proxy_disable which disables proxy. But - in real word - when you disable proxy, it you can't use it anymore, because, you know, it is disabled)The gui itself sometimes is not very clear (which may be problem in gui based game)I would recommend this game, while you can just ignore these things, but definitely I wouldn't pay full price. It is worth €1 or €2, but not €10			"

												While the game doesn't have any flashy explosions or extensive gunfights, there's plenty of tension here. You have to hack into various computer systems to complete jobs or advance the (easily ignored) storyline. With the money you make, you can buy better equipment or a faster computer, which you will need to take on harder jobs. The tension comes from the fact that your hacks usually don't go unnoticed, and during your digital break-in there will be an active trace to find out where your computer is and shut it down. But even if you get out in time, there's still a passive trace trying to find you invisibly, so you need to erase any evidence of what you did to throw that off the scent.Fun if you like somewhat nerdier excitement than ""shoot man in face"".

												This game is great.In it, you start by signing up for a corporation and doing a practice mission.PROTIP: Unless you are a veteran, listen to the tutorial, lest you back yourself into a corner without enough accesible funds to start making money.I would rate it as follows:Gameplay is 8/10. Really fun, but can quickly get dull and repetitive.Atmosphere is a whole new level. 11/10, no. F***ING 15/10. It's definitely the game's strongest point, and, honestly, that may sound scary for something made in 2001, but it shines through.Multiplayer is N/A. There is a live IRC in-game (but nobody seems to be playing anymore. Sniff.), but other than that it's completely solo.Story is 7/10. It's kind of interesting, but the hook is easy to miss and it's overall fairly dull.Overall is 9.8/10, as it's fun and iteresting, but if you REALLY hate anything repetitive then you'll have a problem.

												One of the most fun games I've played, but one of the shortest in different ways, but there's backends to that statement.Uplink is a game where you're an Uplink agent and must do missions on 'hacking' for money and gain ranks, with this money you can buy 'hacking tools' which you use on hacking missions. You can also buy upgrades for your gateway.The game is really old so it seems really fake (logging into systems using a password cracker and copying, modifying, deleting files and deleting your logs.)Even if you do finish the game early, basicly by reaching top status and hacking into the bank accounts of people and getting rich, upgrading your hud to the best and grabbing the Uplink agent user file and putting them all in jail or saying their all dead, you can get the alternative storyline, which is, very fun.This game is really fun even though it can be hard and boring but I've enjoyed playing it.

												One of my friend bought this game, and never bothered to actually install it and play it.  Since we shared our game library, I decided to give it a shot.  I knew nothing about the game, and just dived in head-first.  The beginning is a mockup of an OS installation, and then you get access to the main screen, or 'desktop'.  The tutorial was easy to understand, and the test mission yielded no consequence for failure.  Once you get the hang of hacking, you can accept missions.  These missions are ridiculously easy, so failure was practically non-existent.  You didn't even need to delete the logs.But as you get better at hacking, your rank goes up, and so does the amount of skill and/or software required to complete missions.  The game has a main story, but I have yet to try it, as I usually prefer the sandbox feeling.  The game is open-ended, and truly allows you to do whatever the hell you want.  You can even hack Uplink itself.  You can change your criminal records and get yourself arrested.  You can get OTHER people arrested.  Just fun overall.The graphics are nothing special, and the hacking is NOT EVEN CLOSE to what it truly is, but it's addicting, and it makes you feel like you're commiting computer crimes.  And that's good enough for me.10/10 Would recommend.  I think the price is perfectly fine and reasonable.			"

												I was skeptical about this game but I actually found it to be quite fun and addictive. One of the greatest things about it, perhaps, is the ability to jump on when you have a 15 minute window, do a couple of missions and close it. That is, if you have the mental strength to actually close it!The game has aged decently well, in my opinion, and it's still fun, and definitely worth it. Especially if you can get it on sale!			"

Programmed by one guy and designed by one guy, with a handful of testers, an amiga Mod tracker music soundtrack (including a track from a member of Future Crew), and a horrifically low-budget feel. The UI is basically designed to look like the FUTURE! version of desktop operating systems if they'd kept the aesthetics of windows 3.1And it is a game about.... HACKING!*. Like in the movies, hacking!* ZOOMS and rows of randomly flipping numbers and big bars and everything! It is, simply, the greatest HACKING!* simulator ever created!*HACKING! in no way related to actual hacking, which is essentially 'trick them over the phone into giving you passwords'. "

You're a freelance hacker working for an agency that provides you a list of potential assignments that early in the game range from corporate espionage and college transcript falsifications to destroying company databases and altering criminal records. Buy your gear, select a job, hit the target, cover your rear on the way out, get paid, rinse-and-repeat. The game features a lot of financial management aspects as you need the funds to upgrade your hardware and software to take on the more difficult assignments later in the game.

A must - buy as it currently costs just 1 euro You work as an agent for a corporation called Uplink. You have to complete missions involving hacking into corporations to steal important data or changing someone's academic degree. You can do this using different software you buy that help you with security, speed and other things. All this time, you have to be careful not to get caught by the police who are trying to find you and put you behind bars. Overall, the interface of this game is what I love about it, but the whole concept is ingenious too.I would give this game an 8/10 1 Point is deducted for a slight repetition between missions1 Point is deducted because of the bugs I noticed while playingI strongly suggest you buy this game.

												Never has a game so captured the atmosphere, the mythos, the feel of the cracker realm. It is not a simple game. It is a game of extreme rigor. Of meticulous planning. Of method. Though you will not learn to crack, you will learn to hide behind proxies, to erase logs, to fabricate evidence. Reality will bend under your fingers as you type onto your keyboard. And as you delve deeper and deeper, you will start to see the world you live in differently.You'll start to realise how much we've become dependent. How everything runs through the network, everything is connected. And how easily some things, in the grand mesh of connectivity, can be altered, lost, stolen.After all, they are all but numbers. Try to change them.			"

												How to put into words... Uplink: Hacker Elite is the kind of game I wish to see more of. A sort of, free roaming do whatever you like approach to hacking. I keep looking, hoping to find something that matches or even exceeds Uplink, but not even Watch Dogs comes close to the kind of fun and nail biting terror this game brings.Like, I remember the first time I played this game and started hacking into my first target. I forgot to erase my logs and I'm sitting there, panicking, because I knew of the active and passive trace system the game had. So what did I do? I went to my last bounce point, erased the logs there, and stopped the passive trace in its tracks.This is a moment in gaming I am embarrasingly proud of and a testament to the game itself.My only wish is to see this game with a more active modding communtiy and maybe even a steam workshop, because I've played this game inside and out (Don't let the 2.7 hours on record fool you, I played this game long before steam). So, if you really are looking for a hacking game that can challenge you with a deep narrative hidden underneath and fun gameplay, grab Uplink.			"

												Fantastic and addictive game, super hard to start off with but once you've got the hang of it then it's much easier. I haven't completed either one of the storylines yet due to getting shutdown a couple of times for not deleting my logs quick enough. Two gripes though - if you are wanting to be a 'good' hacker (attack companies not people) you only get a third of the work than if you don't mind being a 'bad' hacker. Also I would love a way to switch off the story missions and just play in a relaxed mode. Oh and being able to save just before the story kicks in so you don't have to start from the beginning would be nice too.			"

												Uplink is one of my very favorite games in the world. Even after playing Introversions 2 other game hits after I bought this one (DEFCON, Prison Architect), I'd still say this one is the best. The only con of this game I don't like, is how slow the start of a new game can be. I've never liked the first couple of tiers (Copy a file. Destroy a file. Copy a file. Repeat.), but once you start hacking social security, criminal records, banks, the game REALLY picks up! (After a couple of play-throughs however, you start picking up a few tricks to get you ahead quicker.. ;)   ) For $9.99, I'd still be a bit iffy on recommending it, but if it's $5 or below, buy it NOW.If $5 is still too much for you, just wait. Uplink and DEFCON (Uplinks brother) often go on sale for 99 cents (which is how I got both of them).			"

												Got cocky and thought that bypassing the firewall, proxy, and monitor would make me immune to tracing. Didn't see any trace progress, assumed I pulled it off right.Was in the middle of draining a third account into mine when I realized I forgot to delete the first one's stateme--Wait, what's a black screen mean?...OH. I lost. Well then.++++This game can be surprisingly hectic, especially when you hear the trace tracker going haywire over you having less than 60 seconds left to delete logs and get out before AUTOMATIC DOOM.But there's a complacency too, once you get a nice massive bounce grid set up and get all three bypasses at max... except see the above scenario of UNEXPECTED DOOM. So don't get cocky. Don't forget that a tiny screwup somewhere can and will cost you.And yet, the sheer satisfaction you get for pulling off some of the hacks makes the panic worthwhile.I will say that the learning curve is kinda steep, and the game doesn't really do a good job of warning you when you need to step up your game and buy upgrades. And the game doesn't know the meaning of the words ""forgiveness"" and ""mercy,"" because screwing up the tougher hacks ends in either a loss of your Gateway and all upgrades (via Self-Destruct security module) or a game over that kills your save for any purpose other than viewing your final score.I give it 8/10, would play more.

												It is game with great potential and pretty fun to play. However there are loads of details that are not vital for gameplay, but they are annoying.For example,  ip addresses: these are just random numbers, but from broken range (I usually got adresses like 842.274.407.350)Names of programs and warning/error messages are not corresponding to reality. (I got message like access denied by proxy.  I tried to change my proxy map so it will not use the broken one. Nope. You have to buy program proxy_disable which disables proxy. But - in real word - when you disable proxy, it you can't use it anymore, because, you know, it is disabled)The gui itself sometimes is not very clear (which may be problem in gui based game)I would recommend this game, while you can just ignore these things, but definitely I wouldn't pay full price.

												(Before reading this, please know that at the time of writing, I have played the campaign through to the end offline as there is almost no point in playing this game online. This is why it says I have only played for about 10 minutes)I have nothing but praise for this game. It is a hacking game mainly focused around the use of programs (executed through the UI rather than the terminal) to hack into banks, research databases and more. The campaign is interesting but most of the fun occurs when you are hacking into secure databases with a countdown timer on how long before you are traced pulsing faster and faster until you either suceed or bug out. Or fail and go to jail (that is rather depressing). As you earn money, you can upgrade your programs and computer hardware to become more effective at hacking. Finally, as you hack important databases (like the Global Criminal Database), a news feed reflects this by creating an article describing ""a malicious cyber attack has left the GCD crippled"" (or some such). Some of the most tense and entertaining hacking I have ever played.			"

There's not too much to it, but pay attention and a small storyline opens up that puts pretty much everything at risk and leaves it to you to decide what to do.All in all, this is a great game to kill a bit of time with, especially if you're without internet access for some reason.

												One of my friend bought this game, and never bothered to actually install it and play it.  Since we shared our game library, I decided to give it a shot.  I knew nothing about the game, and just dived in head-first.  The beginning is a mockup of an OS installation, and then you get access to the main screen, or 'desktop'.  The tutorial was easy to understand, and the test mission yielded no consequence for failure.  Once you get the hang of hacking, you can accept missions.  These missions are ridiculously easy, so failure was practically non-existent.  You didn't even need to delete the logs.But as you get better at hacking, your rank goes up, and so does the amount of skill and/or software required to complete missions.  The game has a main story, but I have yet to try it, as I usually prefer the sandbox feeling.  The game is open-ended, and truly allows you to do whatever the hell you want.  You can even hack Uplink itself.  You can change your criminal records and get yourself arrested.  You can get OTHER people arrested.  Just fun overall.The graphics are nothing special, and the hacking is NOT EVEN CLOSE to what it truly is, but it's addicting, and it makes you feel like you're commiting computer crimes.  And that's good enough for me.10/10 Would recommend.  I think the price is perfectly fine and reasonable.			"

												Imagine yourself starting with barely anything: a low-grade cpu, low bandwidth, and little memory capacity. That's where you start in Uplink, but it's far from where you end. In this game, you start with barely anything, and work up to having a full-on gateway packed with incredible processing power, tons of memory and bandwidth, and even security systems for it! With this, you can break into banks electronically and steal millions of dollars. This game makes you feel like an actual hacker. You can access the international academic database, global criminal database, and the social security database, and you can CHANGE values in those databases for ANYONE, including yourself. Got a criminal record? Break into the GCD and clear it. Want to have a degree in something completely random? Access the academic database and give yourself that degree.If you want Watch_Dogs because of the hacking, get this instead, it's cheaper and better.I love this game, 10/10, worth more than $10.			"

Every now and then when I say to myself ""this is getting boring, pulling up the passcode breaker (which you dont need to do anything to hack a password), then clicking on the copy and paste key"" the game always pulls you back in, giving you new missions with more variety. It even gives you a chance to work against your fellow hackers. There are a few gameplay details skipped (but mentioned) in the tutorial, including erasing your trails, but so far I haven't been erasing my trails and i'm still going strong. Not only is the gameplay pretty fun, but only a few breaks in dialogue tell you that it's a game. The whole time, it's as if you are an actual illegal hacker, and not just some time wasting yet entertaining game. 8/10 would buy for 20 cents again (prisoner architect sale).			"

												This game has given me a bad itch that won't go away if I'm not playing it.There's something about this game, out of any other game in my Steam list that just NEEDS TO BE PLAYED.I'd kill to even see this on the PS Vita or 3DS, and not just Steam and the Android Market (Specifically the Tablet market only.)But I must say, this is one game that I can't stop playing, and always seem to have to learn something new when it comes to different systems you have to hack, jobs you have to pull off, and trying to be an Uber-Skilled bad ♥♥♥♥ when you rob a bank, which NEVER gets old.Recommended for anyone that wants a somewhat pretty great dive into what it might be like to be a hacker, I doubt it's truly like this, but God, I wish it was... but at least I have Uplink.

												A great little game in my opinion, and one of the few games I have found where hacking is exciting and interesting, or where you get access to an actual terminal and get to make actual choices rather than there simply being a 'hack' button. I got this cheap as part of a bundle and I'm so glad I stumbled across it, as I don't think I otherwise would have found it.However, this game can become a little repetitive as whilst there are many different mission types, within each category the missions are basically the same (hacking 1 bank is the same as hacking any other), however the late game missions have more variety, which leaves some replayability.Overall a great game if you like this kind of genre, and I hope to find more like it.

												Never have I thought I would so thoroughly enjoy watching years of corporate research data disappearing as I crash a sytem or hacking into the Global Criminal Database to order the arrest of someone for crimes they didn't commit.As an agent of the Uplink Corporation you can do all this and more as you are hired as a freelance hacker by major multinationals to do their dirty work. From your home computer, secured behind the proprietary Uplink Gateway system at the nearest Uplink Corp. office, you can execute massive computer crimes and even take part in a story involving the entire Internet being placed at risk.Uplink is an incredibly open game, so there are many ways you can proceed (including ignoring the story missions altogether)... but remember that ""Trust is a Weakness"". This game will instill you with paranoia very quickly, as you begin to second-guess yourself if you covered your tracks well enough to avoid that black GAME OVER screen meaning you've been tracked.

												Uplink is a game about hacking. It's completely unrealistic. And it knows it.Unlike everything about hacking in the media today, including the over-hyped Watch_Dogs, Uplink is probably the most realistic hacking game you can get.It's age definitely shows, as it's clearly designed for a 4:3 screen (although it does work great on 16:9), and has a in-game purchasable IRC client that is an actual IRC client that connected to a server you could chat with people with. Despite not having modern connection encryption capabilities, I got it to connect to Freenode.

												I have owned this game since Introversion first released it way back in 2001. Since then, I've played  countless hours,  and enjoyed every minute of it (except for the times I got tracked down and the game ended.) The graphics and interface may be minimal, especially compared to your standard FPS, but for a hacking game, they are perfect. What few sound effects that are in the game are used extremely well - the insistent ""beep...beep...beep"" of the Trace Tracker as you race to complete a hack and erase your tracks gets the adrenaline going just as much as fighting off a mob of enemies in the latest Call of Duty clone. The game is played out entirely through your computer terminal, or ""gateway"". Through this gateway, you accept missions, hack systems, purchase software and hardware upgrades, and try to stay a step ahead of the authorities. All communication with your employers is carried out through in-game email and text - there is very little voice recorded for this game. The missions themselves range from simple hacks where you only need to delete a single file, to complex attacks that have you navigating a local area network (LAN), blocking (or disabling) security systems in an attempt to destroy a mainframe. All in all, I heartily recommend this game.			"

It holds up extremely well as a game you can pick up and put down at any moment, and I've always loved the concept of hacking and bypassing computers in games and Uplink was one of the first examples of handling this, and does it in a very user-friendly way without making it overly complicated (save for the LAN hacking, which I still don't understand how to do.)

You have to complete missions involving hacking into corporations to steal important data or changing someone's academic degree. You can do this using different software you buy that help you with security, speed and other things. All this time, you have to be careful not to get caught by the police who are trying to find you and put you behind bars.

												A grand game, with excellent design and concept.  It's gameplay is outstanding, and feels quite immersive.  It doesn't hold your hand through pretty much any aspect of it, but instead leaves you to figure things out on your own, and to learn from your mistakes.  The storyline is actually quite good, assuming you can figure out how to progress through the story, as you'll have to act on random events that are actually realivent to the game.  One of my favorite things in this game is the amount of freedom it gives the player, allowing the player to essentially find other ""Uplink Agents"" and proceed to hit them with an arrest warrent, and then watching the news for the story of their arrest.

You take jobs ranging from data theft to falsifying records to robbing banks. All of this is done through a GUI/text interface that will fully immerse you in the experience of ""hacking."" Due to the nature of the game, it has aged quite well for having been released in 2001: its graphics are simply as good as they need to be. A few gripes: The interface could be smoother and more intuitive. The missions do become a bit repetitive once you get the hang of them. And the whole game becomes incredibly easy once you know how to rob banks. But these are just small problems with an otherwise solid game.			"

												Once more Introvision has given us an amazing new title.You play as a freelance hacker who take various jobs frommajor corporations and some of the missions involve stealing research data, sabotage, money laundering, framing other people and more.As you undertake more and more challenging missions, the money you earn from completing them will allow you to upgrade your hardware to allow for quicker hacking and many other useful improvements.Of course you do have to be extremely careful because as soon as you attempt to hack into a server, using a password breaker or similar software, a trace will commence and if you haven't made it so that the connection is between multiple servers, thus making the trace take longer to complete, then you will be found pretty quickly.There's also the risk of the goverment trying to find your server and shutting you down for good, but this can be prevented by having multiple servers and also ones that have several slots for security measures like motion detectors for detecting federal agents near your gateway and a gateway self destruct for when they do come for the gateway and you have to prevent the feds from finding out where you are, it is highly recommended that you get a gateway that has slots for both of these security measures as having just one is just about useless.A must have if you have a thing for movies, games, books and so on that involve hacking into computers and such.

												Uplink is interesting take on playing a hacker. The game offers an intuitive interface for a type of game that isn't often covered let alone done well. The music is also a nice touch as is the interesting storyline that occurs, which you may look into or simply ignore.  As an Uplink agent, you take on jobs from various companies and perform tasks such as hacking a mainframe to delete a file or scrubbing an individual's police record all the while working on covering your electronic tracks so you don't get traced.  It holds up well despite the years.4 out of 5 stars.			"

												I really want to like this game. i got it from the Introversion Pack during the summer sale, and decided to play it. At the price I got it for, it's really good. The problem is, its just so... boring. Every mission is so similar. But its a great concept. If you hant to make a hacking game, take a look at this. But I got it for 50 cents, so during a sale, I would reccomend it. Would benefit from varied gameplay (its basiclly use your Password Breaker, mabey run a Proxy Diable, change something, you're done). But I liked the 5 hours I played, and at the end of the day, I'd reccomend this,EDIT:During the time I played, I hadn't gotten to the story. I don't know anything about it, and the latest missions I've done were find finacial info. It may get better later on, idk.			"

Uplink surely is a fun game and has it's moments (succesfully hacking your first computer for example), but unfortunately it gets repetitive way too quickly for it's own good.

Later on you unlock a different type of connection where you have to perform other more complicated tasks (I don't want to give anything away).

												How to put into words... Uplink: Hacker Elite is the kind of game I wish to see more of. A sort of, free roaming do whatever you like approach to hacking. I keep looking, hoping to find something that matches or even exceeds Uplink, but not even Watch Dogs comes close to the kind of fun and nail biting terror this game brings.Like, I remember the first time I played this game and started hacking into my first target. I forgot to erase my logs and I'm sitting there, panicking, because I knew of the active and passive trace system the game had. So what did I do? I went to my last bounce point, erased the logs there, and stopped the passive trace in its tracks.This is a moment in gaming I am embarrasingly proud of and a testament to the game itself.My only wish is to see this game with a more active modding communtiy and maybe even a steam workshop, because I've played this game inside and out (Don't let the 2.7 hours on record fool you, I played this game long before steam). So, if you really are looking for a hacking game that can challenge you with a deep narrative hidden underneath and fun gameplay, grab Uplink.			"

												Fantastic and addictive game, super hard to start off with but once you've got the hang of it then it's much easier. I haven't completed either one of the storylines yet due to getting shutdown a couple of times for not deleting my logs quick enough. Two gripes though - if you are wanting to be a 'good' hacker (attack companies not people) you only get a third of the work than if you don't mind being a 'bad' hacker. Also I would love a way to switch off the story missions and just play in a relaxed mode. Oh and being able to save just before the story kicks in so you don't have to start from the beginning would be nice too.			"

												It's quite an old game and I did own it before it was released on Steam but somehow lost the CD. So when I was seeing it being released on Steam i immeditaly bought it again. It's an interesting genre that not many games touched so far. The graphics are simple and some might not like it but I think it just adds to the atmosphere. The missions to grind money can be quite tedious but you can spice it up by hacking someone's bank account and try to get away with it...the missions that drive the story are also interesting and provide a replay factor. Certainly recommend it.			"

												Got cocky and thought that bypassing the firewall, proxy, and monitor would make me immune to tracing. Didn't see any trace progress, assumed I pulled it off right.Was in the middle of draining a third account into mine when I realized I forgot to delete the first one's stateme--Wait, what's a black screen mean?...OH. I lost. Well then.++++This game can be surprisingly hectic, especially when you hear the trace tracker going haywire over you having less than 60 seconds left to delete logs and get out before AUTOMATIC DOOM.But there's a complacency too, once you get a nice massive bounce grid set up and get all three bypasses at max... except see the above scenario of UNEXPECTED DOOM. So don't get cocky. Don't forget that a tiny screwup somewhere can and will cost you.And yet, the sheer satisfaction you get for pulling off some of the hacks makes the panic worthwhile.I will say that the learning curve is kinda steep, and the game doesn't really do a good job of warning you when you need to step up your game and buy upgrades. And the game doesn't know the meaning of the words ""forgiveness"" and ""mercy,"" because screwing up the tougher hacks ends in either a loss of your Gateway and all upgrades (via Self-Destruct security module) or a game over that kills your save for any purpose other than viewing your final score.I give it 8/10, would play more.

												Uplink is a thoroughly enjoyable hacking simulator that will make anyone playing it feel like a one-person army. Send corporations scrambling as you leak critical information, change a person's history, steal cash from rich moguls, and break into high-security government mainframes. Above all, don't get caught.The game is heavily based on Hollywood's hackers, which makes the mechanics easy enough to learn in an afternoon while still providing the tension, cerebral challenge, and satisfaction of a good puzzle game. Combined with a cool interface, appropriate sound effects, an interesting storyline, and a great soundtrack, Uplink is very likely to be your next video game addiction.The only con is that the text is incredibly small at high resolutions and there is no good option for fixing that without lowering the resolution.

												I think Uplink is overall a good game but it does have it's problems the good aspects are as follows*Good Gameplay*Amazing ways on how to handle each situation*Hacking Simulator FTW*Some pretty deep moral choices*And fun optional stuff to do on your own free timeHowever there is problems and I have a few to share and here are my problems with this game*Single-player only* no funn time with your friends this is a very good game that I wish they optimized multiplayer on. Hell even a mod would work.*One life progress loss/Lack of diffaculty settings* Alow me to explain I played for 8 hours on end and failed ONCE and lost all my progress and had to restart and I can say this for everyone that it sucks to lose alot of progress and though this a hacking simulator to mimic real life hacking then I relly wish they would have included diffaculty settings other then the diffaculty they set you in like Easy for beginners or somthing so when you fail it is not to much loss to stop a regular or new player like myself to put down the game permenantly or for a long time so it is a bad draw back in my opinion hell even the option to go back to a previous save on the easy non existant diffaculty would be nice so players of all kind can enjoy the game.*Passive Traceing* while ingame hacking you need to make sure to eliminate all evidence of hacking or they will passively trace you i wish they let you buy somthing so you don't get passively traced as often as some new players may not get the gist of how to elimnate evidence as well as it is redundent to go to the same place after every hack to eliminate evidence hell even that is not enough sometimes the problem with this is it can get alittle annoying for new and long time players just doing the same thing over and over again but i will not go to much on this one as it is not as bad as i am makeing it sound just get into a pattern and you will be fine with some experiance of course* somewhat unfinished* when i look at the game i feel like they where going to add more settings and equipment but did not get the chance to do so like look at the gate way security only 2 security features even though it shows a list i feel like they where going to add more but never got the chance oh well problems can occure and the game is ok with me in its current conditionOverall the game seems ok but it is not recommended for people who don't like perma death and a steep learning curve at times i will give the game a 8/10 it has it's problems but anyone can enjoy the game*EDIT* Oh boy has it been a while since I wrote this review and do I have some intresting things to tell you time for me to tell you some stuff you can do if you are haveing some problems with this game or do not like somthng about this game. Well this edit I will explain stuff that will make this game more enjoyable as it will let you enjoy the game with less worry of data loss and of course community DLC that will expand the game alowing newer and more seasoned players to continue enjoying this game or even get more enjoyment out of it. Now time for me to re explain thisMakeing a Perma death Safty Net/Backup Saveing: This one was a big problem I stated in my Original Review is you can't stop loseing progress if you got caught in game because developers where in my opinion where basterds for not includeing a setting to turn the perma death thing off or include save functionality alow me to revaluate perma death. In binding of isacc or a game like that where perma death is included it is useally made to be done in runs. You do a run in the game until you die or succssed and then you do another one, even FTL or Faster then light also did this that is what I expect out of those games as you are suppose to do them in runs. let me get another example MInecraft problably one of THE biggest Sandbox survival game that started the trend of sandbox survival has purmadeath if you die in the game you lose all your items but if you have cheats on you can turn that off aswell also you can recollect them if you go back to where you died but be quick as they will despawn after some time. AND minecraft even had a hardcore mode where you played the game in one life then you where forced to delete the world but the diffrence between that and uplink oh idk maybe it was a ♥♥♥♥ing option take notes devolpers think about the game you are makein then decide if you put perma death in it or make it an option or make a save system so data can be saved permantly geez. either way to circumvent this situation in piticular you can browse the local files of this game and locate the file named users there you will find notpads with your savedata name there are two files with the name of your profile and if your smart enough then you should know what I am about to say next. Select those files copy them and paste them into another file that is not in the games file's and vwella you have a backup if you ♥♥♥♥ up retire that save go into the files copy paste the backup into the user file and you can revert back to where you were. Sweet bliss to know your not gonna lose that data as developers where asshats and not givin ya a thing to not have to worry about it.*More Content* You can get more content thanks to the community gotta love the community to provide support for a game even if it is old the community has made DLC you can get and you launch it. keep in mind the dlc works not in conjunction but seprate from the main game it requires you to own the game to use it but they are not linked to eachother meaning there saves and data are not synced just keep that in mind when getting some DLC for uplink i recommend Onlink if your computer can run it. It is community DLC that you play and it has more content and such then the origianal alot more and with so many options and security systems you need to intercept, it makes it so much fun to play in generalOverall with this new info my New rateing for this game is a 9.5/10 the game still has some flaws but this new information makes this game a hell of alot more enjoyable then back then am i right :p			"

												I actually didn't expect to play this long in this game.The BeginningAt first, it kinda seems repetitive and basic. Doing the same work, with different companies, and very little risk. But as you work your way up, and the stakes get raised, and one tiny mistake is the difference between payday and being caught by the FBI is truly when the game shines.You might think ""oh, well I'm not really that good at these games"", but the game offers a decent enough tutorial to get started. It starts really low so that you can get used to it - which is both a fault and a good thing - and works it's way up slowly in both what you have access to, and how difficult the missions become.You might not even know what half the HUD you're presented does at the moment, but don't worry - almost everything in this game has a purpose.Working UpSlowly, you'll go from doing work copying files from obsecure companies to higher-scale operations, like hacking into the Social Security database and marking someone as deceased. You'll start getting better gear, but with that you're asked to work quicker, work better, and make less mistakes. Slowly it becomes less of ""damn, this file is too big"" to ""♥♥♥♥ THE FBI ARE COMING FOR ME"". And it does this perfectly, in essence.Though the game engine occasionally makes a cheap mistake, it's rare and whenever I was caught I could identify what I did wrong. It was always some trail of breadcrumbs leading back to me, and if you're caught at first - it's ok. There's a lot of learning to do.At the TopDepending on how well you understand the game, you'll eventually be making a decent living for yourself, to the point at which you don't even necessarily need to worry about doing contracts to make the Uplink funding requirements. You can explore the deeper and darker secrets at the heart of this game, which I expected there to not be many of.There's always a hidden admin panel on Uplink's website. Do you try opening it? What will happen? There's also a big company which - according to the in-game news site - is working on a massive internet virus. Do you attempt to intervene and save the internet as a whole?Lessons LearnedIn my time played, I've discovered the following tips will help a lot with this game:Always make sure to delete logsBig corporations work with the FBI a lotEven one false connection, one ♥♥♥♥ up, is the difference between freedom, and prisonFailure is failure (yes, that's right, in this game, if you fail, it's game over)In all, I highly recommend this game for it's excellent ability to teach you stuff without forcing you to sit through a tutorial, and truly making you want to explore the environment and the world in the game, looking for shady stuff, for weird connections.My score: 9.5/10 "

												With even ONE hour playing this game, I can see that this is one of the most unique hacker games on the market. The simplistic design reaching the most radical of strategy shows that Introversion knows what they are doing. Bringing in small concepts that create the best game experience I've seen in a while.Gameplay: Can't even be put into words, 8.5/10 Design: Not the most graphicly inclined, good for what it is, 7/10Replay Value: I cannot make an honest opinion as I haven't even gotten through one mission that isn't a tutorial, update later.Content: I can see this game getting boring doing the SAME thing just in different orders, 6/10Overall Review: 7/10			"

												Uplink is a hacking-sim in which you are an agent working for an underground corporation known as Uplink taking on certain jobs in order to get enough credits to tackle on bigger jobs. This game successfully captures the '80s style of hacking into a video game form.What makes this game so brilliant is the 'tracing' that is performed whenever you attempt to hack a server. Using any form of brute-force technique or logging in as an admin starts an 'active trace'. This means that you have a limited amount of time before the server admin's find your ip and hit you with fines or jail time, so you must be quick enough to get in and out of the server before your time runs out. There is also what is known as 'passive tracing'. This starts after you have hacked a server, done what you needed to do, and have gotten out. The server admins will begin checking log files to check the ip through which you have connected, essentially meaning that the admins will be creeping up on you through these logs, so you mest never forget to delete them! One simple mistake in this game can cause you to be caught and you fill face jail time. The game is hardcore, in which if you get caught, your save will be deleted forcing you to restart the entire thing again from the beginning. One of the things to be aware of is that this game can get repetetive. If you are caught and must restart from the beginning again, you will essentially be doing the same jobs again. If you can get past this, there is a lot to be enjoyed.Some of the starting jobs will be simple things such as copying files from servers and sending them in an email to your contract employer or deleting certain files from a server. If you manage not to get caught in the beginning and make it to the later-game levels, there will be some interesting jobs such as framing people and wiping entire databases. Don't think that money will come to you easily either in this game, you will have to grind to get some of the better equipment (or you can hack a bank, try not to get caught doing that ;) ). And always never forget the simple things of hacking in this game. For example, forgetting to delete your logs just once will make you lose, so never forget to delete your logs!The main story is about a company attempting to develop a virus and destory the internet. There are two sides that you may choose, to side with them and help develop the virus, or to side with another company and try to stop them. The choice is completely yours. Much of the story and campain is delivered through the news board in the Internal Services System and through emails that you receive, so make sure to read these.Graphic wise, there isn't much to say. The game follows the same 'the graphics aren't good because it's old' rule. Most of it is text-based/gui-based, and it is black and blue, so try not to let it strain your eyes. If anything, there are community themes which can be found online with a quick google search to shake things up a bit.The soundtrack, is nice and fits with the theme of this game perfectly. Again, not much to say.Overall, this game is nice, and if you can get past it being very repetetive, it can prove to be very interesting and much fun.			"

												I wish this game was popular. It's awesome, fun, and it takes place in 2010. Getting money's a little grindy, but the mechanics are good enough. I don't know what else to say about it. It's just fun and interesting. Plus, I haven't found any other games that make hacking fun and semi-realistic....Semi. It's not SUPPOSED to be 100% realistic though. It traded some of the realism for fun value. Also, I dare you to buy the IRC upgrade.			"

												A pretty old game, but it's as they say.""Old But Gold"".At the start I was so confused, had no idea that to begin the actual Missions I would have to hack into the test server (I'm a dumbass).But after having my account terminated (many times) I learned to do better than on my last go,What I love about this game is that it's trial and error, no margin for mistakes.Any other game out there is like:Oh, you fell of a cliff that said ""Do not approach"", don't worry, come back from the checkpoint.In this game it's more like: Oh, you forgot to delete your logs in the InterNIC after a careful hack with no other traces>Sorrt m8, back you go lolol.
