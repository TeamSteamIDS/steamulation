												A wonderful remake of the Atari 8 bit classic Archon. Graphics and sound are fine, but it's the great gameplay that makes this game so enjoyable. The original Archon only had one game board and no campaigns. This game has many different game boards and some interesting and challenging campaigns. I've put a lot of hours into the campaigns and more than got my moneys worth.			"

												I consider myself to be a ""Retro-Technologist"", meaning that I still have functional classic computer. I have a Commodore 64/128, and my copy of Archon still works on it. I bought this game, and the classic mode is pretty much perfectly done. I have done side-by-side comparisons, and can notice no flaws in the Classic verion. Even that is well worth the $9.99 price tag! Add to that, the updated version, and you're really getting a bargain at that price. "

												The remake of this classic game is almost excellent! The graphics are modern (ok it might not be top notch like in Dota2 but still it’s a great visuals to performance ratio). We have many new features which introduces a little bit more complexity to the original gameplay in respect to the strategic and RPG element of it. The new features include: campaign mode (actually 2 campaigns for light and 2 for dark), different layouts (boards), secondary abilities, different kind of magic squares, different difficulty levels and finally we have piece leveling up (up to third level).My only complaint is about the multiplayer - it should really be implemented as some sort of LAN or steam server matchmaking and not a hotseat.Anyway it’s definitely worth the $10!8/10			"

												a remake of original Archon with + better graphics.+ new layouts.+ very similar gameplay.+ singleplayer campaign.+ multiplayer mode up to 4-players!(it's possible for 2vs1 battle, should be possible too for 2vs2)the problems are :- the graphics are still not good compared to current games.- the AIs are either too easy or too difficult.- the (early?) campaign is just some repetitive battles.- the multiplayer mode is only hot-seat. (no lan/internet)if you were a fan of original Archon, have extra gamepads andfriends nearby to play with, maybe you can enjoy the game.			"

												This game had me given a split personality syndrome. Why? Simple: I just don't know if I should love - or hate this game.It's advertised as Archon classic, well that isn't exactly true, it is more than the classic game from the 80s of the last century, but it still has the classic gameplay with some not so obvious changes. It has become far more strategic than the original. Furthermore you have secondary attacks now, which also weren't present in the original. But the original idea, the eternal struggle between the light and the dark side are still the same, as were some of those obstacle glitches that could change the outcome of an battle in the original game.The game can be loveable and frustrating at the same time, I know the game as an original, and yeah, even if it has a lot in common with chess, it is a fast paced battle-arena game. Sure it's two dimensional, but you don't need more for this kind of battle. This game offers even some more depth than the original by changing battlefields, secondary powers and... well campaigning... should I tell you more?Of course, the developer could have created an even better game by adding the contents of Archon 2 and Archon 3 (which was the worst of the series) and give access to such classics as the juggernaut or others by gaining victory points and so on. The idea of Archon is timeless, but I fear that this game might not be counted to the best games that were ported to our ""next generation machines"". Furthermore, the price of the game is ok, it isn't the best value offer, but it is still a lot better as most sims or visual novells which go for the same price. Once in a while I just love a quick and frustrating game of Archon, even though this game is now 30 years old.			"

												OK, first off, I actually owned the original game plus its sequel Archon II:Adept as a kid in the 80s. This is just bad. This game has bad graphics, bad sound effects, and annoying music. Neither the campaign mode nor any of the added features like a 4-player variation make this game worth any amount. Also, only local multiplayer? The only thing that this game has going for it is nostalgia. Oh yeah, did i mention the hard crash to the Windows desktop midgame? I am glad I ONLY paid 99 cents for it. Stay away.			"

												Archon Classic is a game made by Archon fans to Archon fans enjoy. I played the NES version and Archon Ultra for MS-DOS, always guessing how cool would it be if… no matter what, Archon Classic will satisfy your inner and deepest desires.This is a chess-like game where pieces of Light and Dark fight each other in real-time battles. Of course, most of the game’s strategy is on the board, where the turn-based portion takes place. If you’re a regular chess player, you’ll probably start thinking about openings, forks, movement block, waste of time, zugzwang and other well-known elements of chess.If you just want to finish the game, there’re four campaigns with 15 missions each that won’t take too long to beat; one or two weekends would be enough to go through all the missions. If you like to unlock every achievement and complete 100% of game, know that Archon Classic will keep yourself busy no matter how skilled you are.Each campaign level has three rankings (bronze, silver and gold), and it’s possible to replay all the maps with the Insane difficulty, not to mention the possibility to turn on the secondary fire mode, which adds a little more depth in the real-time battles.Keep in mind that there isn’t online multiplayer, which is a shame considering that it’s possible to play with one or more friends on the same computer. Good luck, however, to find someone that comes to your house just to play Archon Classic in hot seat mode. I managed to twist my son’s mind and convinced him to play with me as an ally, and it was really cool beating the forces of the darkness in teamed up battles.I’m not sure if I would recommend Archon Classic to players that never played or heard about Archon before. This is really a game dedicated to longtime fans. Every cool aspect of the previews titles is present here. Things that old Archon fans used to do, like beating the computer as fast as possible or killing his entire army with the weakest piece is funnier than ever, especially because most of these insanities are now part of the campaign.

												For those of you who grew up playing the original Archon, you will be glad to know this one exists. It has everything the old game did, and offers a lot of improvements. The major thing being secondary attacks. Those were first introduced in Archon Ultra, and these are somewhat similar. There is also the ability to play on different maps some are dependant upon the number of players. ( You can have 4! :D) There is the classic Archon map, maps that allow your guys to level up to level 3, and maps that have runes that provide benefits when you move onto them.      For those of you who feel the base game was fine the way it was however, and don't want all these additions. You are in luck as you have the ability to turn off the secondary abilities so it will play like the base game. In fact they even brought in the old school original Archon graphics for units, as well as updated graphics. The only drawback is the multiplayer is same computer only. No network/internet. Which hurts it IMO.			"

												I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this with my brother on NES. It was ugly and confusing and I honestly have no idea how we figured it out because it was a rental without a manual and it was the days before the internet obviously. But it reminds me of a long gone time when the only thing there was to do was ♥♥♥♥ around with a game and try to wring any fun you possibly could out of it before you had to take it back to the video store.Anyway, it's kind of like chess but you have to take control of certain squares on the board, and there are little mini battle arenas that happen when two pieces end up on the same square, so it is completely conceivable that the equivalent of a pawn could take down the equivalent of a queen, but it's not extremely likely. Each piece has their own abilities and you can cast spells that heal your pieces or revive them, among other things. It's weird, but it works.Oddly, it still holds up. I'd probably rather just play chess at this stage in my life, but this is not a bad game in the slightest. The production values are a little lacking on this update, but I am pretty sure it was made by fans who loved the game way back when and wanted to do it justice. There are alternate boards, a campaign mode (weird? but just little mini challenges against the AI) and multiplayer. It's a fun game, but I don't know if most folks would enjoy it without that vague haze of nostalgia lingering over them.			"

												A fun little time waster, providing a simple to grasp system with great depth and variation through the many different boards. The units are smart, balanced, leading to fantastically tense gameplay on occasions. However, the games style, taking a board game and a real time arena fight make it unconventional as board game style videogames go, and I would really say it appeals more to the side of me that likes turn based RPGs and old arcade and micros games. Its a worthwhile buy in any case if you want to spend a few minutes thinking and slaying in equal measures.			"

												One of my personal favorite games from way, way back.  Looks like chess, but much better.  When you take a square, you fight for it!  And your ""king"" piece can cast spells.  I'm glad it's been updated with the ultra archon rules, and it's even been taken further!  Yay!			"

												This is a well done indie remake of one of my all-time favorite games. It's has the original with vastly improved graphics over the original 8-bit version, and quite a few new features and game modes. This is a game of strategy, and it's deep but very simple to learn. Lightning fast reflexes and great timing are probably most important, as long as you pick the terms of a fight.Try to fight on dark squares if you are the dark side, and light squares if you are the light side, for a big advantage. Don't leave your best pieces on the wrong color tile or they may get killed in 1-hit.No online multiplayer is a huge missing feature; other than that this game is solid. Fun and addictive.			"

												This has to be the BEST remake of a classic 8-bit game (that I spent time from the 80's even today on the Commodore 64 playing). Other than the great graphics, there are new elements for battle and even leveling up. HOWEVER, if you don't care for the new features, you can turn them off. The only thing I would like added is the old title screen and chip-tune as an extra to view and bring back some more nostliga. But I'm not complaining.Added game types like 'Conquest' is actually fun to play and helps develope skills. If any of you are a fan of the orginal Archon, then you really should play this game. It's so awesome.			"

												Excellent game that brings good old memories to the present, controls are a little tricky but you soon learn how to overcome the trickiness, besides of this and if you already know the old and original Archon then this is a MUST HAVE as the campaigns will add many hours of entertainment trying to obtain the Gold category in every mission ;)			"

												Ah, good old days of Atari 800. Sweet memories. Archon was one of the best games then. It was like arcade chess. Now improved in many ways.			"

												I've played every single version of Archon in the past.  This is a great remake of the original.  Love the storyline modes and love that you can play up to 4 players in teams or free for all.  Very dissapointed that there is no online play of any sort, evrything has to be local.			"

												Trigger warning: wizardsThis could have been a tactically complex, hardcore strategy game that I would buy and never play. Instead, combat is played out in janky 1v1 arena shooter format, destroying any semblance of strategy and making this a game I absolutely love.			"

												Personally played this back in the early 80's on the Commodore and tended to choose the dark side if only because of the shapeshifter and the dragon pieces.  Was not aware of its existance on an Atari until I read some of these reviews.  Saw that it was on the NES only a couple years ago thanks to emulators.While it is not enough to keep my attention for more than half an hour or so, the gameplay brings back the grand memories of the old days.  While I have the option to choose to play with the original graphic style of pieces, I play with the modern looks.The campaigns are engaging, though I am finding the AI to be excessively...stupid.  Knight Vs. Goblin and the AI isn't swinging to take advantage of the opposing piece having its back turned, for example.  It might just be the AI settings I have it on, but not going to test that.One thing that would be great would be the ability to stream the game.  I have tried multiple programs to do this with but every single one of them only show a black screen for the viewers, including Skype's Screen Share.  Would it not be a good thing to show people how great this game is without having to resort to webcam to do it?Edit: Only just saw the last update they did to allow for windowed mode.  It helps to read some things, too...  Maybe now I can show people this.			"
