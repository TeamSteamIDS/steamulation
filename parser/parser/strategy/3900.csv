												Diary Entry 1- Heliopolis is under siege by Rome. I've been unable to send reinforcements because Caeser is moving his troops around my territory, destroying farms, mines and villages. I can't spread too thin in fear of my other cities being attacked.So 5 handfuls of Heavy machine Gunners have been defending the city from catapult bombardments and grenadier attacks.And now, he seems to have set his sights upon the neighbouring city of Memphis.Diary Entry 2 - I've reached out to the Malinese and Isabella of Spain, and both have declared war on Ceaser. They are on the opposite side of him to me. So while they cannot directly help my cities, they will put pressure on the Western side. So hopefully I can repel the siege and push to his cities. I have a troop of tanks coming in from the Northeast, and a regiment of Marines coming in from the southeast. Diary Entry 3 - The marine regiment was ambushed on both sides upon coming around a mountain. Despite the enemy taking heavy losses, we lost the regiment.Luckily a reinforcement squad was detailed to memphis, so now it's a case of bunkering down for the incoming attack, and planning the counter offensive.The tanks have made significant progress, taking the city of Ardea from the grasp of the Romans. They will continue their progress north, towards Rome itself.Diary Entry 4 - A reserve regiment of Marines have rendezvoused with the tanks. The dispatch will push on to Rome, flanking from the south, whilst Memphis defends and draws the brunt of the Roman Empire.Diary Entry 5 - We took two cities to the south. And i decided it was now the time to counter attack. Making losses along the way, we broke through the memphis siege, and took the city of Ostia. It was short lived however, as the enemy retaliated while we were at our weakest and reclaimed the city. Luckily, the reserve squad was just 1 click behind, so now we can retake the city again, and await reinforcements.I see very little action on the Western side, I am beginning to believe my allies have hidden motives. Their troops linger on the enemies borders. Perhaps waiting until I am weak enough that they may strike both me and Julius Ceaser. I must prepare for this eventuality.Diary Entry 6 - I was wrong to doubt Isabella. How could I let the seeds of battle cloud my mind. She commenced her march across the border today, and in one fell swoop, she liberated a city from the enemy. Her troops have now joined mine, and we march together to the heartland of Mother Rome-iaDiary Entry 7 -  Isabella and I, sat down today and signed the Permanent Alliance of our two peoples. We will forever be comrades in arms, and for this, I graciously gave her 3 cities as gifts. Not without proper thought mind you. They are in 3 strategic places to mine enemy and mine future enemies. This will allow us to adaquately aid each other in times of war, and even further each others growth.To our future! -clinks glass-Diary Entry 8 - Rome has fallen to Spain! I made a good choice in allies, Isabella is ruthless, a worthy opponent to any who may cross her.The Chinese also declared war on Germany, Frederick reached to me.. unfortunately, as well as the war on the Romans is going, I cannot extend myself at this time. He seemed disappointed.Diary Entry 9 - An achievement I am unsure of. We have created...The Atom Bomb. I don't know what to think about this. A weapon with destruction beyond any imagination. One that would win countless wars, but with such heavy costs. I must make sure this never falls into the hands of our enemies..Diary Entry 10 - We were pushing the city of Cumae today, they had heavily fortified the city, and it seemed an arduous task. The combined might of myself and Spain, and yet we struggled.. A shadow appeared on the horizon. They came bearing the flag of Rome, and begun a charge on our flank. We were outnumbered, the rest of our forces had lagged behind to clear up the enemy remnants. We hastily mustered a defence as best we could. The doors to Cumae opened, the cities huge force came out to greet us. We were preparing for defeat..But then there they came. The Malinese army! They routed the enemy on our flank. Taking advantage of this turn of tide, we charged the enemy city, gates wide open and with morale turned, we claimed it for our own.Diary Entry 11 - It's been a long war, spanning many years. Due to the efforts of our 3 way alliance, we have chipped the Romans down to a fraction of the strength they once possesed. Brundisium is their final city, their last stain on a world so tainted by greed. I have the honour of being the one to remove that stain. I now make my march, our footsteps of doom bellowing down upon the city walls. We are coming..Diary Entry 12 - As we approached the gates of the Palace, Ceaser panicked. He offered a Peace Treaty, along with all his coffers. ""Why barter for what I can simply take?"" I said, leaving a lifeless corpse on the floor. My troops rejoiced, sharing drinks with the Spanish, and food with the Malinese. What was I doing? I was looking across the border to the North... towards the prosperous Chinese Empire.TL;DRHonestly, you have to be a fan of these types of 4x games, to enjoy them. A lot of people find them boring because there's a decent amount of waiting around while you wait for buildings to finish, units to be trained, research to be finished etc. Saying that, I find Civ games to be faster paced than games such as Crusader Kings/Europa Unversalis. The learning curves are a lot smaller too!You'll never find great graphics in these types of games, but you'll always find amazing gameplay, and that's what matters right? Great gameplay is what keeps you playing, not great graphics. I'm not a fan of the newer games, Civilization: Beyond Earth especially. I think they completely ruined that game. However, if you enjoyed the previous games (1, 2, 3) or you want to get into the series without spending a lot of money. I whole heartedly recommend this game.			"

												First off, I actually have 75 hours in this game at the time of writing, since you launch Beyond the Sword if you have the DLC. This review will be done through the eyes of a player coming from Civ V and will be a comparison of the two.TL;DR - I love it. Probably not as good as Civ V, but familiar and different enough that I think it makes an easy buy for any Civ V fan. Pros:+ The espionage is much, much more entertaining and active, I love it. The capabilities of a spy include bombing building, poisoning the water supply (food reduction), sabotaging production, stealing technology, influencing religion and civics, and a couple more. You can also alter your production of espionage points to lean towards or away from certain civs (for example you can produce more points towards your biggest rival, and less points from distant civs). It is a great system.+ Combat is very different, and in my opinion better. Units unique abilities are given more weight; archers and longbowmen can be incredibly powerful on city defense, catapults and trebuchets are almost absolutely necessary for taking a city, etc. There is more incentive to not just build 20 of whatever unit has the most combat strength and charge in. Combat gets a little smarter.+ Given the 5 year gap between IV and V, you'd think that Civ IV would look much poorer...and you would kinda be right. Things don't look as great, a couple of the leaders are ugly as sin, but it more than makes up for this in building a stronger atmosphere. It does this by actually having a few different models for units, and I don't mean unique units for civs. It things like this; everyone can build a swordsman, and they will have have the same stats, but if you play as Arabia, they will have scimitars, if you play and England, they will have broadswords, workers will look different, etc. It is a great touch. There is also unique music for each time period, like when you first start a game it will play tribal music. If you are playing as Spain and click a unit, they will speak in Spanish. These kinds of things make up for the 5 year gap in graphical capabilities. + Random events. Now I know this might sound bad, but they are reasonable and I think spice things up quite well. They are not completely random and tied various things like the time period. Examples would be a nearby mountain being an erupting volcano and destroying nearby improvements, if you have the slavery civic you might have a slave revolt and lose production for awhile. You'll also get choices most the the time. Like a Russian government official wants to defect to your country, do you accept him and gain espionage points against Russia? Or arrest him and hand him back over, gaining a relationship boost for Russia? It's fun.Cons:- What I feel is the biggest con: there is a loss of uniqueness for civs. There are no civ perks like they're were in Civ V (Venice can only build one city, Rome gets +25% for each building already in the capital, etc). These perks were one of my favorite things in V and I miss them. Each civ still gets a unique building and unit, but these often are (mechanically) much more boring than they were in Civ V. Nothing like the Zulu unit who has a first strike, or Portugal's ship that can also do a trade mission. Often in Civ IV, the unique units just start with a particular free promotion, that any other unit could get if it gets enough experience. These changes allow for more freedom but also take away some of the reason you pick a particular civilization: to play a particular playstyle. I pick India because I want to play small but powerful, Rome because I want to spread my empire far and wide, Germany because I want to have large standing armies, etc. Instead most civs have multiple leaders to choose from. While this is cool to see different faces, all the leaders have two traits that many other civs also have. Yeah Genghis Khan has the aggressive trait (certain unit types get free promotion and double production speed of barracks) but so does Stalin, and probably 5 or 6 other leaders.- Half of the victory conditions have issues. Science and score are fine. Culture victory is boring as hell. It involves nothing more than accumulating culture points from building and wonders and once 3 cities reach 50,000 bam, you win. Even pre-dlc Civ V cultural victory had you build the Utopian Project. Diplomatic victory is nigh impossible. There are no city states in Civ IV, so you are force to kiss everyone's ♥♥♥ and bend to their wills if you want that victory. Even then if you have different religions they will basically never vote for you. Conquest Involves you taking ALL other cities. Yes even that one out in that distant snow-covered island that has a population of 2. This is kinda-sorta ""fixed"" by the Domination victory type, which involves getting x% of the total land and y% of the total population in the world. Except the numbers are so high that you basically only get it when you could have easily won through science/military/score.Minor stuff:- Unit can stack on one tile. Except the markers for how many units are there max out at 8. So I can't tell if a nearby city has 8 units (hey this is a border city and I am just defending it) or 24 units (hey I am about to ♥♥♥♥ing wreck you in two turns).+ You can see numeric breakdown of relationships for other civs. -4 for different religion, +2 for fair trades, -9 for huge recent war. Quickly brings you up to speed on how heavy certain actions are.+ You can trade technologies!+ A couple more interesting technologies.- The religion system has no perks to choose from like in Civ V.+ In the very beginning of the game you have to watch out for wild animals like bears and wolfs.

												Awesome addition to the Civ franchise - perhaps the best to date. Very open-ended gameplay allowing you to achieve victory in a number of ways, be it through technological discovery, diplomatic clout or all-out war. The diplomacy and trade mechanics aren't quite as polished and intuitive as, say, Total War: Shogun 2, and the 1-unit vs1-unit combat can often be a little frustrating and unpredictable, but there's a sense of great accomplisment in watching your cities and friendships grow, denying a plea for peace from a rival empire that dared to once challenge your might, and renaming the conquered cities of your enemies 'Asstown' just to spite them. 9/10.

												It's 4000BC. Before me stood a tribe of people who called themselves 'Romans'. They have decided to finally settle down after many ages of nomadic life, they look to me to guide them in these uncertain times. Who would have known, that this small settlement would be the beating heart of what would be perhaps the grandest Civilization that has ever come to pass. They all looked to me to guide them on this journey, it was up to me to guide these people to their glory, perhaps even...their destiny.3000BC. It was not long after when i came across other groups of people, each with their own cultures, one particular group i met claimed to call themselves 'Germans'. We greeted eachother with a sense of suspicion of our two peoples. Beforehand we knew nothing of the world but our own kind, i could tell by the look by his facial expression that it would be a while before we could trust eachother. As it would turn out, his suspicions later on would be well founded.2000BC. Surveying the known world before me, i immediately saw a potential problem. The geographical location of the Germans mean't that i would be able to keep them penned in, in order for my own people to claim the surrounding lands as their own and settle down in the areas of question, but i soon realised on the possibility that i may need to subjugate them by military force before this potential nuissance to my South East grows to become an ever annoying thorn in my side. I made my choice, in order to make sure my people would prosper largely undisturbed, the German people must become part of the Roman Empire for the sake of longer term peace between our two peoples.1500BC. After building some legions of Archers and Praetorians, i watched the borderlands closely, they had already expanded to make a settlement just east of my own. But that was not the main concern, as i discovered i still had an open borders agreement with the Germans, as they managed to settle to the North of my growing empire also. I immediately cancelled the agreement in attempt to contain him and prevent such a move again, but the fact they had settled to the North, where a vast continent was waiting for their potential to sieze mean't i could delay no longer with my plans for subjugation.It was time to sound the horns and bang the drums, to war.1400-700BC. To be honest, i was a little uncertain what the outcome may be. The Germans had concentrated their troops in the cities, while i was spread thin on the offensive and in some ways, fighting a war on two fronts, since i wanted to take the German city of Munich in the North as soon as possible to minimise any chances of them to expand further into the world that would lay before them, while at the same time besieging the settlement to the East so they cannot so easily rally their troops and use the settlement as a springboard to invade my territories.But this was Rome, they possessed some of the finest warriors of their time, the Praetorians. They made devastating work of the German troops which were quite numerous and perhaps to most lesser quality troops, too strong. However, fighting a war on two fronts still takes its toll. As i concentrated my forces to the East to take the settlement in order to march on their capital, Berlin, while harassing the Northern settlement to make sure they could not grow so easily.600BC. Berlin has fallen, and with it, the heirachy and leader of the German people, I also gained new knowledge of a settlement to the North East of Rome itself. I had been aware of this Civilization, but not in finer detail. Upon looking at our geographical locations i thought to myself, ""It may be possible i have to subjugate this Civilization too, some of their settlements are already not too far from my own, then again, the Egyptians could perhaps keep them occupied in terms of landgrabs alone for me to turn my attention elsewhere.500BC-1200AD. The Greeks to the west have had me concerned. I know little to nothing of their military strength, i would be investing more troops to the area, if not for the accursed barbarians who seem too keen on stealing some of Rome's riches by pilliaging the lands. I also decided in the end, due to the present situation, it was not worth going after the Milanese to the North East.The French and Spanish seem to have been driven to the point of War. Isabella urged me to join the conflict againt the French. I declined, since to fight a war quite far away and at a time when i was occupied with growth would put quite a strain on my Empire's production and economy.1300-1600AD. The 'Franco-Spanish' war has come to an end it seems. No clear victor as i can make out of it. I'm glad that the balance of power has been indecisive as this means i am pretty much the more dominant power of the world. Plus when i have borders of 4 nations to watch over, my power is best kept conserved on the homefront. Meanwhile, i had aquired a technology in order to break free from being only able to traverse shallow waters. Now able to traverse deeper bodies of water, i can begin exploring more of the world. I soon found a new Continent, and more Civilizations with it. But there was no room for expansion, as evident as not too soon the Persian and Mongolian Empires would duke it out.1700-1800AD. It seems the Japanese are having a go this time against the Spanish. This time though, upon Spain's request to assist her against the agressors, i answered the call, something which would save her for the time being. Japans armies were something of the last era, and stood little to no hope against my Grenadiers and Musketmen. I razed one of the Japanese occupied cities they had cultural claim over and captured, so they would not have such claims over the surrounding lands again any time soon, while the other city they occupied, i liberated and handed over authority to its original rulers the Spanish. The Japanese, shattered by their losses made peace with Spain and given my job was complete, i followed thereafter. Victory was shortlived however, as Napoleon of France was now beginning his march into Spanish territory, thus begun the 'Second Franco-Spanish' war.1800-1830. The war was going horribly for Spain, the capital Madrid had fallen, and upon getting dragged in found out that France was on par with technology as i was. My expidition force had no heavy guns of the like, and in so much as step a single foot on French soil, my expidition force was mostly anniahlated. Only a company of Grenadiers fortified at the Spanish city i recaptured was all that remained. As i counted my dead and came to terms with what had happened. I recieved news from the Milanese Embassy......A state of war was declared between us.1830-1930. The 100 year struggle to quell the Milanese was a bloody one. I learned the hard way the usage of artillery on cities, and after taking a 3rd city from them, figured they had been taught a lesson and put in their place. So i signed a peace treaty with them to which i can imagine we were both relieved from. The war had taken a toll on my power status as i now didn't have the lead i had before this bitter war. I also considered razing the city of Gao to prevent Egyptian influence threatening my borders. But in the end i spared it and decided to give it to the Egyptians as a gift.1950.From here i leave to you to decide what the fate of the Roman people shall be in the next 100 years. As it stands, i am in a sort of Cold-War esque stand off with the Egyptians, while the Indians on the other Continent are really making things concerning on the score and i cannot afford another war, things are getting tight indeed.May not be as graphically good looking as Civ V, but i don't mind that small little detail. From what i hear Civ IV is more complex so may feel more rewarding as a result. I may have only *36 hours gameplay, but damn am i enjoying this game.8/10*At the time of review.			"

												 Once upon a time, I tried Civilization V. I discovered it was buggy. What I did play was really fun though. So my in-laws bought me Civilization III, which was really fun. I then saw that Civilization IV was on sale, along with the expansions, so I bought the main game and a couple of the expansions. I am currently enjoying the happily ever after.This is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. My husband and I are enjoying a hotseat match in which I am sure will end in a bloodbath. In Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword I am preparing to conquer the world with my mighty Celtic army. Civilization IV is an awesome strategy game in which almost anything is possible. There are so many different leaders to choose, and many different ways to beat the game. Sure, you could do a military victory, but you can also win diplomatically, artistically, and financially. There is also the Space Race...For those of you kind of wary of strategy titles, let me assure you this is a very newbie friendly game. There are a variety of difficulties, and very detailed tutorials to help out. Also, being turn based has a huge advantage in being able to think out what you want to do. Having played Paradox Interactive titles like Victoria II, this is a far cry from the level of complexity found in those games. Nor is it very concerned with historical authenticity. When I first played as Boudicca, a warrior queen of the Celts, I expected to run into one of the Caesars, but instead I ran into General Bismark! My husband demonstrated some interesting divergents from history by having his Germans found Judaism 8), Christianity, and Islam. By what should have been mid-early Dark Ages, his musketmen were busy conquering the Russian Civilization. By the Industrial Revolution, his assorted tanks were conquering the world. He then won peacefully by using the UN to vote himself as the ruler of the world. Yeah...you definitely couldn't do that in a Paradox Interactive title.I know I have many many more hours of enjoyment awaiting me in Civilization IV. This is a great game to play solo or with others. I can't wait to explore all the possibilities.			"

4 out of 5Addictive empire builder to the point of insanity.It was Saturday morning, I decided to start a game of Civilization IV, a short session of one hour wouldn't harm I thought...36 hours later, aw damn it.Yes, Civilization IV is addictive, but it's also incredibly awesome. Borrowing elements from other successful empire and city builders, Civilization IV is the top of the management game with such slickness you'd think you were actually playing a divisive game of chess. Buy it now.			"

												A revolutionary game for its time, Civ IV is still good nearly 10 years later. By far a better game than Civ V, IV is complex and engaging with more to learn every time you play. If you buy this game, there is a strong chance you will become obsessed and spend hours on end playing. As long as you have the time, Civ IV is much more worthwhile than many of the newer, more expensive games out now.BUT if you do not want to lose hours of your day without noticing... DO NOT get this game!You don't mind playing marathon sessions and being totally obsessed with conquering the world? Then this is the right game for you!Just one more turn ... and one more turn .... one more ...			"

												Civ IV makes plenty of great changes and additions to just about every aspect of the hazardously habit-forming strategy blueprint that famed designer Sid Meier and his talented team have made famous the world over, from combat to diplomacy to research to production to winning the space race. undamentally, this is a much-improved version of the same Civ games we've all been playing and desperately trying to put down for years. And that's far from a bad thing. In fact, it's an awesome thing.If you're familiar with the Civilization series, then you're already well aware that they've traditionally been turn-based strategy games that let you play as the political leader of one of the world's nations in a fictitious bid to take over the globe.The series gives you plenty of ways to do this, such as conquering your neighbors, researching advanced technology, or, in Civilization III (and IV), creating the most cultured society on the planet. It's this great variety that helps give Civ IV the same alarmingly addictive quality its predecessors carried. Like in previous games, your political leader has two special traits that will influence his or her reign, though all the game's traits are new.The Civ series' gameplay has several components, and almost every single one of them is improved in Civ IV. For instance, the series' combat system, which pits different military units against one another based on relative unit strength and technology, has been changed to a ""strength"" system that seems more intuitive.Civ IV has also improved on the way diplomacy works. While you can still make nice with your neighbors, you have more options than just trading goods, cities, technologies, and/or relations. You can attempt to influence your neighbors to make war or peace with other neighbors, and you can even fence everyone out of your backyard using the game's new ""open borders"" system.The new great people system is an interesting and useful addition that will probably be especially appreciated by experts. Great people can be expended in exchange for a number of powerful abilities. Civ IV makes a turn for the better by emphasizing strategic planning in general, which ultimately makes the game more balanced. In response to fan requests to adjust the pace of the game, developer Firaxis has added three speeds: the surprisingly fast normal speed, the even-faster quick speed, and the slower-paced epic speed. Even single-player and multiplayer options have been improved in Civ IV. The single-player game offers much-improved artificial intelligence that seems to cheat much less than in previous games, or not at all.Multiplayer also seems to work quite well, and thanks to the game's faster pace, it seems much, much more realistic to actually finish multiplayer games, especially on the ""quick"" speed setting.The actual game itself looks considerably better, even though the interface can seem a bit rough at times.An incredibly addicting, engrossing, and incredibly well-designed inclusion. No stone was left unturned as the developers crafted this masterpiece and if you’re a fan of the previous installments of this game, you’re definitely going to enjoy this one.			"

												Classic Civilization gameplay polished to a fine sheen. The music, in particular, is fairly epic in scope to match your efforts. The core is the same, lead your civilization from the beginning throughout history, and try not to smeg everything up too awful. As addictive as ever.The expansions add a few new mechanics and civilizations, and each has their own scenarios you can choose to play through. You will need to have a certain version installed to have access to the scenarios designed for it, unfortunately. Each is tuned to the appropriate mechnics and everything is generally balanced quite well,The AI can pose a real challenge to your eventual world domination whether in scenarios or in single player matches in the randomly generated worlds. There also has been a heavy modding community for Civ, so mods and extra scenarios are readily available. Civ 5 finally seems to be catching up with the polish of its predecessor, but either can be a great time with a bit of investment. 5/5			"

												Don't let my ""1.9 hours on record"" fool you, I've played over 1000 hours in the Civ4 expansions: beyond the sword, and warlords, and let me tell you - this is one of my favorite games of all time.It's easy to get into and super addictive. Whether you want to play it like an economic or diplomatic power, or play it like a 4x war-style game (like most people do), it's go something for everyone.  Lots of customization, expansions, and mods to keep it fresh.Matches can be as short as a few hours or as long as a few weeks.  Great turned based strategy that blends the need to balance economy, science, and culture with military might or defense.			"

 Originally posted on September 16, 2007 Civilization 4 is a really fun game, based on a formula of expansion, growth, and conquest. However, it does have some flaws.Graphics- The Graphics on this game are, by all standards, nothing special, but a vast improvement over previous Civ titles. Besides, graphics in a strategy game aren't really the main focus.Sound- The game has some great music tracks, which are era specific and usually appropriate. While the music does get a bit repetitive, I still haven't gotten tired of the opening title. The sound effects are pretty funny, which help contribute to the feeling that Civ4 is ""just a game"". A good thing, in my opinion. Also, Leonard Nimoy speaks to you every time you research a technology.Gameplay- This is where Civ4 really shines. The game is really infinitely replayable, with infinite possibilities and completely ludicrous historical combinations to try! The city building and expanding mechanic is very solid, however combat needs A LOT of work. Battles are simplistic and very unbalanced at best, relying almost completely on numbers and tech level rather than strategy or practicality. I for one, feel that stone age spearmen should never be able to defeat attack helicopters. In addition to this, some of the civics and the entire religion mechanic are completely pointless, which is a shame, considering they could have been put to very good use. Ultimately though, the game is still very good, and very addictive. I give it an 8.			"

												My hours played is misleading. I played this game for hundreds of hours before I even had a steam account. It is one of my all time favorites.   I have played every Civ game since the original except for the newest (Civ 6) and this is hands down my favorite. It has great expansion packs, scenarios and mods (fall from heaven 2 is a must-have). It seems there is a dispute over whether civ4 or 5 is better. Personally, I feel 4 is more in depth and when I play 5 I get bored for some reason. Some people complain about unit stacking in this game,  but I have never had strong feelings about it and am not sure what the argument against it is.			"

												The original Civilization is among the most enjoyable, influential games of all time. Its sequels have sought to build upon the basic model by adding greater levels of complexity and streamlining the interface. And though the sequels were definitely great games, they were still rooted in an interface and gameplay style that had changed very little since the original was released in 1991.That's not the case with Civilization IV. It reenergizes the core concepts of the series, staying faithful to what fans expect while also creating a wholly original game. While the game hasn't lost any depth or detail, every aspect of the design has been streamlined to make it easier for new players to jump in and less monotonous for veterans. Die-hard fans will definitely find that the game offers up so much more variety this time around. The shape of each game is quite different, from the ways you build up your empire to the ways you tear down the empires of others. Sadly, even the most comprehensive reviews of Civilization IV can't discuss every aspect of the game. There's just so much to experience in this game that you can't possibly hope to cover every topic. While I'd love to tell you all about the other joys and secrets here, Dan and I have to go and teach the Greeks a lesson			"

												My god..this is addicting. You'll spend hours repeating the line ""Just one more turn"".Only buy this game if you don't mind losing some hours of your life on a daily bases, once you start playing you'll be hooked on trying to improve your empire and beat out the other Civilizations (or wipe the others out all together, whatever takes your fancy)10 years since it's original release and this game is still a gem, way more appealing then some of the modern 'fancier graphic' PC games today, you're always learning new things about the game, and though hard at first you'll soon figure out the basics on what you're meant to do.Though this game never gets dead easy, it will always be somewhat a challenge which is good. Who wants to play a dead easy game? Not me, that is boring.If you want this, I recommend  The Complete Edition it adds much more value and gameplay to it..though it increases the addiction rate.Buy this game you will NOT regret it.

												Fair warning:this game is not for the faint hearted. The experience comes primarily from the involvement with the game over time. A good civ game is not one that lasts a couple of hours, but one that lasts eons where pretty much all countries have discovered nukes and robots and are on the verge of destroying the entire world. I will put my hand up and say I havn't played a proper game yet but coming from the earlier civ games, this is a thing of beauty.			"

												The Russian people under there wise ruler Flazam II, decide to found there first city, Moscow.Moscow started as a small farming city. With little to no army but an expansive amount of fields and pastures. But soon enough we were running out of space. We decided to found 3 more cities all in the continet we resided in. After exploring the continent the Russians met two other Empire who lived nearby first was Asoka of India, and secondly was Saladin of Arabia. Asoka and Flazam became good allies, Russia would send some of are livestock from are farms and in return he would give us money.  For 1000 years we remained a humble farming civilization. That was until the scholars in Moscow came to there great leader Flazam II with some reseach. Gun Powder, this new discovery allowed are civilization great new oppitunties, and so in 1245 AD Russias militisation began. Are Armies grew with the most advanced soilders in the planet. Grenidiers, Riflemen galore. We gained a reputation so great two nearby Arabian cities revolted to join are Empire. Quickly Russia became the greatest military might, but still we remained close Allies with are neibhour Asoka, a relationship that had stood the test of time. Saladin however attempt to convert my people to Taoism and was spreading vile rumours about are wise ally Asoka. After hearing this news Flazam II got his noble stead and rode to Mumbai to discuss the pesky Saladin. it seemed India too resented him, therefore Flazam II gave are knowledge of gun powder to Asoka, with this gift Flazam II made a proposition. The Russia-Indian alliance should combine on a common enemy of Saladin and to unify the continet  under are great alliance. Therefore in 1348 war on Saladin was declared by both are nations. We quickly mobilised are troops on the eastern front storm 3 of Saladins cities adding them to are now vast empire. The war on the west was more vicious India was suffering some large casulties, therefore Flazam II sent some of the best fighters in are Empire from St Petersburg to aid in that front. With the help we pushed both fronts right back to the circumference of Saladins capital. In only 25 years Saladin was on his knees. India accept a treaty with Saladin. Flazam II was furious. India had left when we were so close. However Flazam II peristed the battle around Saladins capital was a bloody one. Lasting 40 years and draining the great Russian empire, slaves in St Petersburg were on strike and the War was begining to drag on. Therefore Flazam persuaded India to join the war once more in a final battle on the capital, and the famous Battle of 1 Turn occured. Saladin was destroyed and The Russia-India Alliance were victorious, but Flazam II still rembered how Asoka has betrayed him and the Alliance was on thin ice, Flazam II spent the next 300 years picking up the pieces of his problems in the Russian cities. The people demanded democracy and in the summer of 1789 Flazam II abdicated and was replaced by the New Russian president. Moscow was well known for its scientfic discoveries, and in 1867 we discovered Urianium and began the Manhattan project. Meanwhile over the past 200 years Asoka had entered a golden age with an empire far superior to ares. This competion began a Cold War with Russia the alliance broke down and times were tough. By the dawn of 20th centuary we had completed the Manhattan project and in 1920's the Cold War became increasingly serious. India mobilised troops round are borders and began sending spies. After India blockaded are Urianium farms the Cold War esclated and in 1935 the Russian president declared War on India, the next year we launched 3 nucleur bombs on Indias cities. India suffered but however they invaded are Urianium fields and launched a vicious offense. Russia was overwhelmed with a war on 5 fronts. And in 1977 we were on are knees all are cities were on the brink of revolution and Asoka had captured 1 of are cities. Russia pleaded with India and India agreed and the war ended albeit with a harsh treaty. India empire flourished as we attempt to pick up ares. In 2014 the Greek Empire was getting worryingly large. It was on a separate continet sharing there land with Mao Zedong. I negotiate with Mao. I asked him to declare war on the Greeks. I pretended to ally with Mao but really I only wanted Mao to invade Greece because I knew the Greeks growth would slow, I secretly however knew Mao would lose albeit it would take at least a hundred years. In 2050 the game ended with India its victors10/10 would spend 30mins making review again			"

												This is one of THE best PC games out there. Sid Meier's Civilization IV is a sequel to the famous Civilization series, having been going on ever since 1991. I had initally gotten Civilization V, and when I got the complete version of Civilization IV (Warlords, Beyond the Sword, and Colonization [a modification of Civ IV that is also a remake to Colonization], all of which are expansion packs) I could not stop playing Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword, until I got Brave New World for Civ V a few weeks ago. And I still play Civ IV BTS. BTS is $10, but Civ 4 Complete is $30, so I reccemond the complete edition.Also, Baba Yetu is one of the best songs in gaming EVER. Baba Yetu has won a Grammy Award. The first, for a piece of music for a video game.A+. SO many pros that each and every con is obliberated. GET THIS. NOW. IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY. IF YOU DON'T, THEN FIND A WAY TO GET $20 or $30, and YOU WILL NOT STOP PLAYING.			"

												A good Civilization game on it's own and even with the base game you will get alot of hours use out of it. But it is made even better with the Beyond the Sword expansion which I highly advise you to get for the full experience to really hold up well against Civ 5  and I should imagine the upcoming Civ6. Don't worry about the Warlords expansion as Beyond the Sword contains everything except its scenarios and opens the game up for a good selection of mods. Put it on your wish list and wait for a Steam sale where you can get Civ 4 complete for less than this game on this game on it's own. I got the CIv4 complete version for much less than Civ 4 and Beyond the Sword seperately like that.			"

												I've been a Civ fan since the very first one (it was the second game I bought for my first-ever computer), and this is the one I still keep going back to. Civ V is nice and all, and I like how they got rid of the Stack of Doom problem, but Civ IV just feels so much richer to me. There's something deeply satisfying about culture-bombing an opponent and taking over a corner of his empire without ever firing a shot. Add on the expansions, and Civ IV is a must-have for any even halfway-serious 4X fan.			"

												Of the four Civ. games i've played (Civ. Revolution DS, Civ. III, Civ. IV, Civ V) Civ. IV is my second favorite of them. it has a great 3D world with great detail and design as well; the HUD is very user friendly and nothing is hard to find. One of my favorite parts is when you complete a wonder, It gives you a nice animation showing the blue prints then the wonder being built. The units look great too, more so when battling other units. The camera angles can be a bit off sometimes but its not often; the customization is really good! You can change your nation's name and description; then pick what victories are allowed and which ones are not. I wish there was more options for the map instead of just the size and weather types. But overall it's a great game and I highly recommend it!			"

												which Civ game should you pick if you only want to buy one?probably Civ V...or II.BUT, co-op mode is broken in Civ V, so get this one if you want to have a game with your friends  against bots.+ may come in second only to Civ V as the best, turn-based civ-developing game+ co-op vs. bots works- combat is less stratiegic in this version due to the mechanic of allowing an endless pile of military units to occupy the same hexscore = 4.5/5			"

												Its probably the last of the best civ's, though i hope not.The only complaint i have about this game is that the worker automate is counter productive. They will keep changing farm to village, or remove plantation and put down a farm. If the worker ai was 100% perfect this game would be 10/10.Get it on sale if you can, but its probably still worth the non-sale price if youve never played it.9/10.			"

												The best Civ game in my opinion. It  covers with the dlc many possibilities of the game. I especially love ""Colonization"", that's actually a remake to the original Sid Meiers game, a good one by itself. (Colonization is about the European settelment in North America)I don't know why it shows only 0.3 hrs - as a matter of fact, I played hundreds of hours as this game is super super super addictive, espcially with the add-ons. For a game like this, they should invent something like the parental advisory or cigarrets : "" Level 1 warning : this game will loose your sleep, your social life, your wife, and your job.Notify the authorities immidiately after using"".

												A good friend of mine bought this game for me, and I was really excited. Me, I am usually a Strategy gamer. And this was my first Turn-Based game. After a hour or two, I actually got a feel. Then I went against the guy who bought the game. I was kicking his ♥♥♥. He had no skill, and my Civ was double the size (Like my ♥♥♥♥. Heh...stupid joke). Then the Barbarians came and took my city. Instead of kicking his ♥♥♥ at the end, we joined together and destroyed them. After the glorious battle, we shook hands, but quickly ripped the arms off of each other! I struck first, and he came in like an Elephant (Literally). At the end of the Greatest War I have seen in awhile, he won. He took over my 5 cities (I sold one to him, actually), and became a closer friend. In my opinion. This game, really did make us bond, just a little more than before. And that is what made me love this game. I am giving this 9/10, because I wish the Explorers could fight offense, instead of defense. I would have won. I could have won...			"

												I absolutely love Civilization IV, endless hours of strategic gameplay value not to mention the game come installed with various mods pre-installed that were created by the community. You can also find other mods that let you play as different leaders, civilizations and scenarios. The combat in the game is done very well, as is the diplomacy. The game also has various civilizations to compete against and each leader with it's various traits. It's extremely well developed and the religious aspect is also done very well, each religion has it's own chapel, monastary, cathedral and the religions unique building. The game is balaced and takes a little bit of time to get fully into it, it's really worth it though.			"

												Championship Manager 01/02 is a great game - yes, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of later versions, but you can complete a whole season in like 2hrs!  Now, you'd maybe manage to play about 3 or 4 matches in the same time. CM 01/02, put simply, is the filtered down essence of what makes CM.Which brings me to Civ IV. I suppose I could stop there and let the analogy do the work for me, But Civ IV deserves more attention.This game, the add-on's that followed and the extensive modding community make for the best experience I have found in this genre. Startling with just a settler and a scout, you will build huge cities, conquer (or be conquered by) other civilizations and  discover new lands and resources to exploit. Smile as you discover a new civilisation that is way behind you in military tech, or feel your heart sink as you realise the nearest source of copper is way on the other side of your island, or worst still, on another land mass altogther!Whether I play a short duel map are a humungously huge one,  I always find myself coming back for one more turn and, hours later, wondering what the hell happened to the evening I'd planned.

												This game is truly destined for greatness. Part 4 of the amazing Civ series allows you to learn about history while play a video game! And it's fun! Choose your civlization, each with special talents (I favor the Mongolians, who are better at conquering new lands and battle.) and begin in a lonely land. As your Settlers create cities, build Workers and all kinds of warriors to valiantly defend your homelands from the armies that you will find. Communicate with other civilizations and form friendship or create war. As you research technologies from the medieval ages, such as smelting, animal husbandry, farming and agriculture, who will become the strongest and modern civilization? This game progresses from the early Classical era to the Modern era, and soon you'll be in combat with jet fighters and ICBMs. Pass world laws, and join sides to demolish an enemy. Create a civilzation to stand the test of time.			"

												This game should come with a health warning, it is highly addictive.  The temptation for just one more round of play just eats up your free time.This turn based game requires you to build your fledgling civilization (choose one from many to control) into a dominant force in the world whilst reacting to and possibly being at war with a number of other civilizations controlled by the game.There are ample choices to tailor your game to suit the time you want to play and your skill level.You can change the size and shape of the world, the level of the other civilizations and the requirements for a victory to produce almost limitless options.It can take a while to become proficient in all the facets of the game, using the various sources of information available to inform your descisions and to use the different units to the best effect.

I would choose this game over Civ 5 any day of the week, except wednesday, but this game and Civ 5 are completely different, yet exactly the same, if you know what I mean. The gameplay is very fun and can have you playing for days, or you could just be playing a game for a few hours and be done with it. The expansions are quite good but the possibilities in the base game are vast. Pick this game up for yourself, if you can't figure it out refund it and get Civ 5			"

I find the graphics simple but effective and the strategic opportunities offer plenty of interest. Later versions have tended to overdue the graphics at the expense of gameplay - but I look forward to Civ VI in due course.I would recommend CivIV to anybody who likes this kind of strategy game.

 Civilization IV        As I awoke a week or so after christmas, it appeared that I got a gift from the worlds best thing, Steam. I quickly downloaded a game that I thought wouldn't be that good, I never really got into turn based strategy games. And I sadly assumed that would be the same case for Civ IV.        My first match was a simple one against a couple AI's. As I chose the best leader (in my opinion) Julius Caesar. I quickly got murdered by barbarians. But during that ten minute interval I learned something: 
Build your first city near natural resources.Screw building any workers, go straight for a military unit to defend said city.THEN make your workers and crap.       After my experiance with this wonderful gem of a game, I learned, loved, but mostly lost. Because I suck at this game. But now I can impress basiclly everybody I know when it comes to civics, economies, powerful world leaders of the past, and what those world leaders led. If you play this game for as long as I have, you can pass any world history exam.Bam, now i got a lvl 4 badge for the review thing.			"

This is the best CIV game in the series. And after all these years, I still come back and play a game of CIV and every new game is unique and enjoyable. It's a game you will never get bored of. Even my Mum still plays CIV - she currently has over 2500 hours playing CIV5 and she's been playing CIV since CIV 1 days (http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032696061/recommended/8930/).

												I probably have hundreds of hours put into this game previously to owning the Steam version. It's generally been my favorite  in the series. This concept worked better when you could still stack miltary units. I've been a huge Civ fan all the way since the very first one came out in 1992.

												Don't get fooled by the low number of hours shown on Steam. I originaly bought this game in DVD when it came out and must have clocked almost 3,000 hours. I lost count of how many times I got surprised by my alarm clock going off in the morning and I was still playing.Of all the Civ games I played, this is my favorite. The AI is pretty decent, there are lots of things to micro-manage, requiring some very carefull strategies to balance the needs of culture, research and expansion without running out of coins.But as a war-monger, what I like the most is that this is the last standard Civ game that still allows for unit stacking. This makes combat really awesome.If you're looking for a game that have that ""Just. one. more. turn!"" factor, this is the one.It really passed the test of time says a lot. There are not that many games out there that are 11 years old that you can still play and enjoy as much as when it was new. Now stop being a cheap schmuck and buy it.			"

												I have been playing Civ 4 for a while now, and I have to say that it's a great game to pass the time. It is also a good game to play if you want to end up ruling the world and are unsure of how to do it - um, did you just read that?So anyway, first of all there's a bunch of empires all with their own technologies, pros, cons and so on. And for each empire you get at least one leader. Each empire comes with a unique unit which can alter gameplay, such as the English redcoat, the French musketeer or the German Panzer Tank.That brings me to the next great part - the units in the game. You start off with one city, and from there you can choose to make/train anything you have the technologies and resources to make/train. For example, you can train a warrior to fight, a scout to explore the map, a settler to find a new city, and later in the game (literally almost at the end), if you have the right stuff, you can make nukes!The real icing on the cake is the fact that it is all so - well, real. You make contact with a new country, you make peace with them, you trade with them, you give them stuff - and then they can turn on you. Honestly Germany, why did you? You beat me, and I had grenadiers, war elephants and artillery; all you had were a few archers and a single catapult!And last but not least, there's the winning. You can win by lots of ways: getting the most points by 2050, getting to Alpha Centauri first (space victory), controlling at least half the world, killing all other civilizations etc. All this great stuff turns the game into a real life simulation that is addictive and super fun. 10/10			"

												When I was first introduced to this game I was quite sceptical having never experienced a strategy game like this before, and being more used to typical RTS games.

One moment I was advancing through the ingame tutorial and the next I had sunk 10 consecutive hours into my first playthrough.

												Sid Meier's Civilization series is one of the most prestigious turn based strategy games in the history of the industry. The fourth installment in the series is masterfully done, and I can play it for hours without getting bored. The expansion packs really add to the experience, not to mention the pre installed mods. I'd definitely reccomend this game.			"

												I haven't played a game like this for years and years.Admittedly I chose Civ IV because of the price.... but damn I can't help but play for hours and hours.Love every aspect of this so far. I've only been playing on the easier difficulties but I find this game has lots of replayability due to the various win conditions, starting points, map types etc you can use to make it more of a challenge for yourself.Would recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet tried a Civ game who doesn't want to invest too much money into the unknown.10/10			"

												Civics IV is the greatest game ever.  On Easy, I ♥♥♥♥ everything in my path.  On any other difficulty, the AI all gangs up on me and steals my resources and womens.  Then I charge battle tanks and helipopters with my spearmen, but they die even though I'm on a hill, which is unfairs.  My fave faction is AMERICA cuz Abe Lincoln is the icon guy and he's a vampire slayer.  But I also like Greece, cuz I like to name the main city after the ancient capitol of Greece: Leonidas.			"

												Where does one begin? A game of this breadth is difficult to encapsulate in words. Profoundly addictive, naturally. But strikes an odd balance between intuitive simplicity (build, expand) and mind numbing complexity (the effects and strategies related to resource exploitation, tile managment etc) that'll leave you content to play by either broad strokes or narcissistic micromanagement.

												The magic of Civ happens somewhere between the discovery of the wheel, and the discovery of gunpowder. It’s there where you have to start figuring out your path to victory. Where are the AI. Where are the borders? What’s your preferred victory condition. How many continents are there? Do you have allies? Do you have cavalry? What resources do you have to hand. Can you trade for more? Can you fight for more? All these questions set off a cascade of decisions.And then it’s 3am, and Ghandi is acting like a child over Uranium.			"

												I highly recommend Civ 4 for one of the best mods I played. Fall from Heaven 2. A mod that adds so much to the game that the vanilla game is like a mud hut next to Taj Mahal.The mod is set in a dark fantasy world, recently waken up from a long period of winter due to the god of winter reigned unopposed until a hero emerged and slew him. This new world has decimated the old civilizations and sent them into a tribal life, struggling to survive. And here you come in. In short order, the mod adds a bunch of new civilizations, very different from each others. Orcs sucks at science, but can produce 2 units at the same time. The Khazad (dwarfs) rely on their stockpile of gold for prosperity, the elven civs can build improvements on forest tiles, etc. Religions added. Civilization alignment from good to evil. An armageddon count which turns the world into fiery hell terrain as it climbs closer to doom. Lairs and dungeons to explore. A ton of story, more or less every unit and hero (did I mention heroes?) have a backstory. Magic. So much magic. It fixed a bunch of issues with the older Civ games, like when the computer civs just zergs down everything, in FfH2, you can combat that, you have mages that can aoe blast a pile, cast fear and break up the stack, use Blind and lock them up, and if you are the one attacking a strong base which contains those mages, you could use assassins which has the promotion that enables them to start attacking the weakest unit in the stack.And if you get tired of this, there is modmods and modmodmods with a dedicated community who worked to keep enhancing and expanding the game.

												I am nominating this game for Steam's ""The Test of Time"" Award because of its virtually endless enjoyability. Even compared to its successors 5-10 years later, this game can hold its own any day. I was first introduced to this game when it was still new (I couldn't have been more than 11 years old at the time), and I was very intrigued by it. The person who let me play showed me it when their civilization had reached at least the Modern Era, as his SAM Infrantry defended against a helicopter attack. He was playing as America, so when he handed off control to me, I felt a sense of duty to carry my country to victory. Besides the fact that I had next to no idea of how to even play the game, let alone  win , Civ IV managed to invest me in the game from the very beginning. This is something it still never fails to do. I highly recommend this game, and I hope one day you'll be able to appreciate the sense of duty in the words,  ""Can your civilization stand the test of time?""  "

												This game is wonderful! I have spent many fun hours playing Civ, both by myself and with friends. I always play the BtS expansion and not this base game though. But it still is fun, and would be worth $50! Buy it if you want a fun strategy game in which you can take your time. The game is turn based, not time based, so waiting a while on one turn to make a decision doesn't harm anyone. Buy this game!			"

												One of the most addicting games I've ever played!  No wonder the joke is ""One more turn""...You'll start out nice and slow, skipping about 20 turns start to finish the first available research.  It's then that the game tempo picks up steam and gets you trapped and the rest, as they say, is history.  Seconds, minutes, and hours will be eaten away with this RTS.			"

												It's a fair Civlization building game. I mean, to be fair, it's the main name in the genre. And it's good, don't get me wrong, but I enjoyed the Civilization games largely when I passed the current era and began moving into future eras with realistic possibilities. Lately Civilization seems to focus more on the past, which is kind of dissappointing.To date, my favorite Civlizatoin game is Civilization: Call to Power, and this one doesn't quite rate up with that one. Still good though.			"

I had a lot of fun playing Civ 3 Complete.

CIV 4 Complete made my brain explode! Fortunately, my life has been unaffected (obviously, my brain was much larger and far superior to that of you common Earthlings. I mean 'humans'... er, people).It much pertier now (was superior).The smooth integration of the IN-GAME editor (press CTRL+W) allows me to create more land, cities, friends, enemies and ridiculously large armies - on the fly! It also means that I begin each game with 2 Billion gold for bribing or, preferrably, enslaving the world.You know? This game reminds me of our strategic training simulatorsback home  on PLUTO.  It's a FOCKING planet!  "

												Still my favorite Civ game. Admittedly, I have never actually played Civ 5 or 6, but I have read about and watched them, and am quite happy with this one (although tastes do differ).Unquestionably a direct upgrade from Civ 3. Corruption is gone! Research and production have overflow now! You can tell how much techs cost!  Culture makes sense! Diplomacy makes sense! There are now anti-StackOfDoom units!If you're new to the Civ series - well, this is the cheapest entry except 3, and there's enough options and difficulty levels that pretty much anybody can find something that works for them. You can pretty much ignore many of the aspects of the game if you want to.Did I mention that this game has Leonard Nimoy? This game has Leonard Nimoy.Of all the games in my Steam Library, this one has given me the most hours of fun compared to the cost (except TF2 - can't really beat infinity).My advice: get the Complete Edition during a sale. A real steal at six bucks.			"

Much more in-depth diplomacy wise than Civ V, a micro managers dream, if you don't buy this then you miss out on one of the most unqiue and amazing experiences in gaming history. Grab the DLC, especially Beyond the Sword, if you want to make the gameplay even better than it already was. A great buy, especially if you wait until it's on sale, where the base game and DLC usually drops to $7.50 from $30.			"

												I realise that it says I have played only 0.2 hours but I assure you that it is lying and in fact I have played closer to 40 hours in the expansions.Rather than write a story about my gaming experience I'm just going to say that after looking through the other positive and negative reviews I have noticed that neither truly bring to light all aspects of this game.This game is simultaneously great and awful. A turn based strategically good time marred by a horrendously stupid AI that coninually demands advanced technologies in exchange for rudimentary research. Don't buy this is you want a complex diplomatic experience as the AI will only leave you disappointed.Edit: I am surprised people disagree with my review. This game has some of the worst diplomacy in any game I have ever encountered, so bad that is truly does remove enjoyment from what would otherwise be a good expanding, researching and auto-resolved battling game.

												This game does not work and it is impossible to contact steam as they are happy to take your money for items which are not supported but fail to allow the purchaser to contact them with a complaint. The same problem occurs with Civ 111 both show an 'out of range ' symbol. I am 73 years of age - when I make a purchase I expect it to work if it doesn't then I expect to be able to contact the provider for a full refund and if that doesn't apply then  'Contract Law' is being abused. Wake up steam not all of us are kids who are prepared to go to great lengths to make a product work.			"

												Downvotes are coming, I know. But I didn't really enjoy this game. I haven't played any of the Civilization games before but I was pretty excited to play this one as I'd heard so many good things over the years.It turns out, the game just wasn't my thing. I thought it was much too slow... Granted, the game has so many features to it and it is decently complex. It is a well-made game, don't get me wrong. It just wasn't for me.			"

												One thing this has that the previous version did not that I am a fan of is the way they show wonders get built in front of you after they're finished. The look and feel of the game is completely different and the controls have also been changed around A LOT. It has some of the same concepts from the last game but you basically have to relearn almost the entire thing. The terrain looks completely different (which is just ok) and the cities are set up in a different grid format that i'm really not a fan of, The city display screen has a better way of controlling what the city focuses on such as production, food, or commerce but the way you control what is being built is terrible compared to the old simple list format. Units are controlled with the right click of the mouse severely limiting your access to the civilipedia on certain objects. Units also don't have an attack and defense rating but just a strength level. Although I like how certain units are useful against other certain types there are way too many types of units. Civilization III was way better in almost every aspect of the game.			"

												He jugado a todos los Civ. Y en mi opinión este es el que menos me gustó. Quizá no le di las suficientes ganas de jugar. Pero su sistema en modo económico empeoró en contraste a Civ3. Una cosa que me gustó fue que cambiaron mucho el sitema de combate en comparación con el tercero, que fue el peor sistema de combate. Lo recomiendo para los que son fans de la saga, ya que vale la pena jugarlo deperdido una vez.No lo recomiendo a la gente nueva, ya que se llevará una mal impresión de esta grandísima saga.			"

												Got sick and tired after the AI got predictably ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly. Some random empire decides to declare war for no reason, from across other nations. Just pure self-destructive armageddon. They aren't even doing to win any land, just slash and burn. Civ II was the best they ever made. These cheap ripoffs don't come close to it. At least Civ II had the spirit of the original Civilization, which was best when played on the Amiga 500. Civ V looks like the same dumb junk, and I doubt Civ VI is going to be any better.Plus, unstable as hell.			"

												To be honest, I'm glad I got this in a bundle. I would be raging like hell if I didn't.It's not a strategic game.It's more like Monopoly against AI: there is a set pattern to go, exploitation and, in end, a pinch of luck required. Don't look to game hours since I've played it offline ('cause Big Picture is a wonderful mode and doesn't crash every 20 minutes with a controller attached, not at all) and it didn't record almost 20 hours. So I've clocked 30 hours into this and... it sucks.Not like a very bad game, or literally, but compared to the other Civs... it just sucks. The AI wants to hinder you, the logic behind them is just pre-setted and poorly programmed: you invade in an early part of the game? They all swap to Slavery, basically ♥♥♥♥ themselves and then, in a point of history or another, gang up and declare war on you - clearly ahead of them in every term possible - from a turn to another, sometimes even with a relationship of -2. You try to buy some allies, to fight them... and your allies usually end up going either to waste or with a peace treaty/peace in a matter of 10-20 days. Also, prepare to give away free techs if you don't want them to dogpile on you.Also, prepare to slow down construction and research a lot, 'cause you're going to fortify your cities like hell. Even so, the AI can expand, build new cities, ramp up military and constructions without a trouble. It's not cheating, they just optimize the written path you all have to follow.You know what, probably I was too used to how strategic Europa Universalis is.Too bad.Glad I got it in a bundle.EDIT: gotta love the fanboys downvoting on this. Looks like you can handle only the ""IMSOFUNNY"" 8/8 comments and those reviews long half a sentence, definitely short-term focus. That would explain why you consider this a strategic game, after all.			"

												A couple hours into the game and the incredabley slow pace of it reminds me of playing monopoly all night, at some point you just want to get to the point of saying I'm done you can just win already. The balance of the units is so off that advanced units are capable of being distroyed by lower teir; for instance muskets carrying soldiers can kill your commando squad; there are also times when your units simply stand there as they get hit with bullets, swords or elephants, the speratic dice rolling of the combat gets tiresome; expecalliy when it can take you all game just to get a decent sized army.          The food and disease levels on here also ruin it for me, no real way to fight the disease and trying to combat the hunger just slows the game down, at the end it can take up to a dozen or more turns just to research a new technology but at that point the computer is already 5 or six levels ahead of you, I played Rise of Nations and thought it would be something very similar but this is a very slow punch to the face, I really wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless you like taking all night just to build a couple towns and research some technology, the rts part of this game only makes up a certain 8-10%.

												What a joke, 2k Games at it again, where they completely change the values in the game, where the opponents can one shot any unit, any city without a fight. Word to the wise, you may think this is the classic you played before, its not. Its been heavily tampered with, where you, as the player, can be killed in the first 10 turns just because the AI decides to declare war on you. And you could even possibly make it to turn 60, where every town has a decent number of units to protect it, walls, whatever, the AI can take the city with a brand new warrior who has never earned a single point of experience, bypassing all defenses.

												Civilization is a game about building a Civilization from 4000 B.C.E. to 2000 A.D.  you can choose from 18 different civilizations to play as.  Within each Civilization you choose a leader and start the game.  You start the game off with a settler to build a town and one warrior.  From there you claim rescources and build a civilization.  You can build farms for food, Cottages for money, mines for material production ect.  You also have to research technologies, these technologies allow you to build more structures within your cities which help them grow faster and build other units.  You also have to take in account other civilizations which you can befriend or turn into an enemy.  I could touch on more but steam Caps the amount of Characters that I can use.  Basically, buy it.

												The greatest part of this title is being able to become Julius Caesar without the threat of Marcus Brutus and the conspirators. There is nothing more excellent than the feeling of celebrating the Lupercalia without fear of omens from a Soothsayer on your impending demise. The sparing of Mark Antony's lachrymation also contributes to this triumph, and Sid Meier is indeed an honourable man. Always keep in mind that the evil you do will for sure live after you, yet the good will be interred with your bones.			"

												Out of a classic franchise spanning many games, this iteration is perhaps the most worthy of praise. It combines the simple elegance of the first game with increased depth, usability improvements, and great modding support. Like all Civ games, it improved markedly with expansions, and I would consider Beyond the Sword to be a must buy. I urge you to try the Fall from Heaven 2 total conversion, a mod so engrossing I still dream of it a decade later.			"

												The ultimate in 4X games, the civilization series is a staple to all players of this genre. Compared to Civilization V, this games is closest to the original Civ I and II before the move to only one unit in one square as per Civilization V. With many mods and varients, this stands out in the series and was the technical high point. Later games started to change the nature of the game from the original feel. There is rich DLC and many community mods. There are some bugs in the community mods but they are diverse and flavourful. The game is readily modable by an enthusiast and small tweaks can be made by the amature. In short, for the price and the play you should have this in your library. 10/10.Just one more turn...			"

												I'm a great fan of all Civs games (Sid Meier is one of my computer game creator heroes).I have played Civ1, Civ2, Alpha Centauri, (some clones not to be named), Civ3, Civ4, Civ5.I still play Civ4 because it is still playable on older/weaker computers and it is  better than the ancestors. Well, some of the (some clones not to be named)  were quite nice and Alpha Centauri is in its own league .Since it has all it 'needs' for what its takes to be a good Civ and you don't have to have the newest/funky equipment, it is the perfect game for the Civ experience.

They do the culture, religion, and combat right, which seems to miss the mark on the rest of the games, the only thing that could make it better is upgraded graphics :)			"

												I played one game as Spain, which gets the conquistador as their special unit. Ended up sailing west where I discovered a new continent with a barbarian city...used my conquistadors to kill them all and take their land. It's just like actual history. But afterward, I invaded Russia cuz they were creepin' on my territory. Ended the game as a cultural powerhouse (so much so that many of America's cities asked to join my nation), had drones circling the globe, ICBMs in every city, and I won with a space victory.If that sounds fun, get this game.

It was kind of hard to fall into, because it is so vastly different from how previous (and future) verions of Civ have worked. It was fun for a playthrough or two before I put it down and went back to V, but I recommend a playthrough if you are lucky enough to find it on sale.			"

												I am playing civ 4 with no expansions and am loving it! It was a great deal and has a lot going for it. I played civ 3 previuosly and most of my likes involve improvements from that and most of my dislikes involve frsutrations from switching to this one. Prosmore map and leader optionsgreat graphics and detailsvery complex to maintain good relations with other leaders, but not impossible. consI don't fully understand how to set up a map/game as im used to the civ 3 methodthe civelopedia seems incomplete as far as helping with playing the game and learning to adjust from the chages from 3-4I cant find a way to prebuild a custom mapworldbuilder after game starts make cheating too easy and temptingOverall I am very happy with it, and mostly my complaints are about adjusting from civ 3. I see no reason in buying the expansions unless you particularly want what they give you.  "

												This is one great game! I love the Game because it shows people how to run something. This could help someone how to run a business or even something in the army. The Civilization choices are a little limited though. I get this is an older game that isnt as advanced as Civ V and the up and coming Civ VI. But i would have liked to see more civilization choices, or at least more leaders in some of them. This game is also good for another reason. The Multiplayer challanges you to do something new in the game. You can play with your friends against each other alot. Which is something i plan on doing soon. I would recommend this game!

TURN!Build a civilization, wage war against others, and become the dominant nation on the planet with a deceptively simple interface and easy to learn mechanics.Choose your nationality and start from meager tribal beginnings to become an empire to be reckoned with as you build city improvements and recruit armies to defend your people and subjugate others. All the while researching new technological advancements and managing your people's happiness and growth.It's insanely addictive, you need to play this if you enjoyed any of the previous games.			"

												1st hour-      Create the Doland Trumpians and quickly rise to the top. Create tons of farms. Find Mudda Russia and befriend them. Find the Brits and befriend them. Russia starts getting needy. I expand my military and claim most of the continent. Suddnely,Russia starts setting up cities all over my borders. I have no choice to attack them since they could become too strong. I send cannons with special abilities to Moscow. Their archers destroy three of my cannons. I chuck my headset out the door.....2nd hour      Russia is furious with me. The war is getting hard because those archers are overpowered. Finally, I defeat them and then the spearmen destroy my catapults.  ITS A FREAKING CATAPULT!!!!!!!! Later,I pillage all of the farms and workshops until there is nothing left. Then the russians build another city right next to me. Luckily I had some grenadiers that were strong enough to destroy their pikemen.3rd hour      Russia's cities are destroyed.....and then i find a whole other part of their land.  (facepalm) I send some ships and cannons down there and find......THE AZTECS! But they are not friendly at all! They threatened to attack me if I didnt shut down trade with the brits. I kept refusing until they got angry and annoyed. 4th hour      Russia will fall!.....then they destroy me last cannons. GREAT! Now I have to send more all the way across the world! (facepalm again)    Ugh.....suddenly,barbarians attack my explorer! But the explorer somehow kills a whole group. AYY LMAO! Then I spend half an hour bringing units back to Russia.Meanwhile,I am spreading Christian and Jewish beliefs across the world. I cant keep track of all the missionaries...5th hour....       I have been playing for so long! ugh,cant stop! Russia is almost finished! One more city,I think...  I take a look back at my colonies in the north and find the brits EVERYWHERE!!!!! Then, Victoria starts trading a ton. Atleast I got some gold from her. I feel like the Aztecs and Russians are planning against me....oh wait..THEY ARE!!!! The Axtecs start getting angry and declare war! Not another war!6th hour!!!!!      The Aztecs are very strong but have little land. If I can get all my cities producing units and bring them to the Aztecs territory,I can defeat them! Then I look at the clock....its 7 PM.........I forgot to eat,too. Dang,Im really hungry now that I think about it.  I guess I should stop playing for a while....			"

												In a nutshell, sid meiers masterpeice. Big fan of the Civ titles, some more than others. Played Civ III for the majority of my childhood on a regular basis, Great game, crazy learning curveThen, picked up Civ V on a wim and was actually rather disapointed. not a BAD game, but not on par with the early'r instalments. To simple, by comparison. (Dumbed down for the casual gamer I guess?)When i stumbled on civ IV on sale I desided to take a risk on it. Best choice of my adult life. Though I haven't had the time to really sink my teeth into it hours wise. the gameplay is so solid I knew I had been shorting my self for all these years. Has much of the complexity of the third title but slightly less intimedating, plus, losts of features that should have been in the games from the get go, such as a state religion. 10/10 for turn based perfectionSpoiler alert.
