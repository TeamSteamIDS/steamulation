												Well this is a game that took me completely by surprise and turned into a game that i have grown to really,really like.Bought it for my daughter and i think i have played it more than she has.I started to play and was like ""OK ITS QUITE ALLRIGHT"" and then i just found the hours passing by and i noticed that i had been playing it for quite some time.I started to wonder why and then it dawned on me i love to complete challenges and on your first play through thats what you get on each level (some are easy and some are frustratingly HARD) and thats what it was,then i started to think OMG i actually like the style of this game and i am having fun (not something you get much these days even when playing triple AAA releases).I think i am actually turning into someone that wants more from my games than huge set peices and big guns and i actually want my games to be fun again (like when i was a child and found playing games fun not a chore),which is exactally what this game is.The graphics are like a cartoon (thats what this game sort of is) but the music can get a bit frustrating at times (same tune),i think apart from that the biggest drawback will be replayability as once you have done the levels and the challenges you cant do them again (unless they have changed this since last i played) and you then get to play a point based version of the game and compete against other players from around the world,and this might appeal to somepeople but i had more fun doing the challenges and getting upgrades to my available abilities (GOLDEN POOH HOW CHILDISH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LOVED THAT ONE) than i did playing the game in this way.

												Poof was pretty fun to play and can get very challenging. You play as a dog protecting a cat from enemies that come through doors and move around the stage towards the cat you have tied up. The stage layout is the same but you can unlock different skins for it. You defeat the enemies by jumping on them or collecting power ups scattered around the stage. Many of these will also need to be unlocked through completing challenges. Every 3 challenges you complete you get one unlock point. You can get a flaming knife that will fly in a straight line killing any enemy it hits. An electrical tower you can place that will shock your enemy when it gets close by. A few other items will help you too like ice to freeze or hearts for health and they can also be turned into poop to slow the enemy.Challenges do become pretty tough and the bad thing is you only get 3 at a time and need to do all three before getting new ones. So progress can become slow on unlocking everything in the game. There is no story just a short quick game you can pop on and play for five minutes or 5 hours if you like. It is fun to play and for the low price it's at you'll definitely get your money from it.Bear Pros:Fun and cute platforming RTSLots of unlockablesChallenging missionsBear Cons:May be to challenging early on for someOnly one map to play onNo new challenges until all three are complete			"

												Poof truly surprised me when I started it up just to collect the cards. I ended up playing for hours, and having a blast. Poof really is a game that I believe needs more attention. In Poof you play as a heroic little dog who's duty is to protect the cat from enemies that spawn out of doors on the side of the level. The fast paced gameplay is where I believe this game shines. It plays similar to Mario Bros the arcade game from 1983, but it also stirs things up by adding tower defense elements. Jumping on baddies heads will kill them, but there is also a variety of power ups to make things more interesting. Every round you have three challenges to complete and once you complete them you earn a unlock point which you can use to unlock a new power up or perk. You have to beat all three challenges to do this (no skipping challenges) and you have to unlock each power up/perk one after another. Some may dislike this as it takes some freedom away from the player, but personally I found that it kept me trying to complete the challenge.   Each level is the exact same layout (well you eventually can expand it a bit) which is another thing that will be mildly disappointing and repetitive to some. That being said, from each match you gain exp towards unlocking new level skins, costumes, and music, a feature that I really enjoyed. The artwork has a very cartoony cute feel to it, although I wish there was a bigger variety of enemies. I played with a Pc Xbox controller, not sure how controls feel otherwise. Poof is not a mind blowing game, but definitely a game that needs some more credit than what it gets.(Keep in mind, this review was written when I was 4.7 hours into the game. I may change my opinions later.)Pros:+ Enjoyable platforming+ Full controller support+ Cute character design and art+ Golden poo+ Variety of unlockables (powerups, skins, costumes, music..etc)Cons:- Would gain from having more level layouts- Sometimes some of the challenges are too hard- Larger amount of enemies would be nice- Floaty controls take some getting use too			"

												Poof is one of those rare near perfect arcade games.  It's just really fun to play again and again. The premise is very simple; protect your kitty from hoards of enemies. As you complete objectives you unlock skills and pickups that add more depth to the game. It's just really well done, with the tight controls and balanced gameplay I never found myself getting mad about dying or just barely missing an objective - I just wanted to try again. The developers put a lot of love and care into this game - the graphics and characters are cute and cartoony, the pickups are all useful and fun (I like how as you pick up items they chain behind you and you can only use the first in the cue, it adds a lot of strategy), the game rewards you with neat skins for the characters and backgrounds and new music, the towers and golden poohs that slow down enemies keep things interesting, and the enemies are varied and require different strategies - it just shows that focused efforts like this can be so much more fun than big 60$ games that try to stuff in everything and appeal to everyone.

+ The gameplay is surprisingly fun and addicting. Basically you are defending a cat while loads of monsters are swarming in. You jump on their heads, use power ups, and build turrets to defeat them and try to last as long as possible.+ Each round you have 3 objectives to complete, and if you complete them you unlock a new perk / power up which adds a considerably amount of replayability.+ Visually very appealing+ Great soundtrack- Some of the objectives are a bit overly challenging to complete- Very repetitious as you play the same level over and over again .- The concept is a bit strange. You play as a dog who has a cat tied up which lays golden eggs...monsters are trying to get to the cat.			"

												For it being a 7 dollar title, it isn't that bad! It nicely mixes the arcade Super Mario Bros. with elements on tower defense to make a fun and challenging experience. With the progressions system you will be able to keep playing and advance, unlocking new items, moves, and room pieces. Definitely 4 - 6 hours worth of gameplay. There are a lot of issues in general, some odd bugs and the complete lack of customization (no rebindable keys is a pain and so is no resolution options).  There are no extra maps. If you get too bored of the current one then that's too bad. It's a shame because a few extra maps can really make the gameplay and strategy vary in a positive way. With that being said, Poof does what it aims to do, but only that. 3/5			"

												Poof VS The Cursed Kitty is one of those games that start of relatively simple and before you know it you are fighting for your life. The arcade style gameplay shows no mercy and finishing the game is not for the faint of heart. While it requires quick reflexes and lots of luck the addictive gameplay will ensure that you keep coming back for more. Check http://www.gameramble.com/poof-pc-game-review.html for a full review.

												Poof takes a bit of the tower defense titles and mixes it up with Mario Bros. styled gameplay (the first game with all the pipes, not the platformer). You control Poof, a dog that has to protect a cat hanging in the lower center of the level from getting attacked by all sorts of creatures. Kill enough enemies, create combos, and use your other abilities to complete objectives, score points and unlock extras, new weaponry and new abilities. The more you play, the more you'll unlock, like towers that shoot arrows or ice cubes that freeze enemies for a short while, allowing you to create even longer combos. The downside is that there's only one level. You'll unlock different backgrounds, outfits, et cetera later on to keep things a little bit interesting, though. You can even unlock an extra (still small) part of the level making things even more hectic.It's a game that keeps challenging you. Rounds can be short but never frustrating. You'll most likely want to keep trying to beat your old score and unlock new stuff, but after about 3 hours you've probably seen most of it already, even if you haven't unlocked all of it yet. It becomes too repetitive too soon. That doesn't make it a bad game, because there's always stuff to unlock, but it needs more than just one level.[Rating: 70/100]			"

Why you asked? Because no one should touch the kitty beside the dog (selfish dog indeed.)Having that said, I still wonder why animal porn is allowed in Steam?Oh well following the story, it was said that the kitty lays golden eggs.. but nope nope nope.. The real deal is someone/something sent you golden eggs if you keep the kitty aliveThe dog did poop a golden poo and THAT'S AMAZING!! :GoldenPoo:Okay then just go and try this game yourself.NB: I still wish that someday R+18 game will be allowed in Steam			"

												Silly, but very fun game!Fans of Super Crate Box and its ilk will definitely find something to love in the gameplay of Poof.  It's frantic and dynamic, and will have you rushing all over the stage to jump on bad guys, collect items, and place towers.  If you get an item you don't want, you can quickly convert it into a 'golden poo' as well, which will slow down any enemies that walk over it, buying you precious time.There's lots to unlock, but there is sadly only one play area.  It's well designed, and it will be expanded through unlocks as you progress, but some more level selection would be nice.  This is the only real complaint I have with the game though: the visuals, audio, and gameplay are all top-notch.  If you are a fan of skill-based games, or frantic twitch platformers, this is something you definitely want to check out.			"

Posted: January 3, 2014
												I checked this game out after reading that it was a cross between the old Mario Brothers arcade game (pre-Super) and tower defense. That's an accurate comparison. It's primarily a tower defense game, as your principle mission is to protect a cat from being captured by the enemies. You play as a dog and can drop poop (yes, poop) to slow your enemies down. You can build turrets, create an ice storm to freeze enemies, hurl flaming daggers, etc. In a pinch? Slow down time for a bit. There is always plenty going on all over the screen. The enemies come fast and furiously. Some fly. Some drop bombs. Some come in packs. Some move faster than others. The difficulty increases quickly and dramatically. Poof is a very challenging game. You realize that immediately when your mission goals include ""survive for 30 seconds"" or ""survive 10 seconds in warning mode."" What makes Poof so challenging isn't just the lightning speed increase in difficulty, but also accessibility to items. While they are plentiful, they never spawn on the ground. They spawn in the upper tiers. Navigating to these items becomes increasingly difficult as the screen fills with enemies and abandoning the ground floor leaves the cat open to attack. If you love a challenging platform/tower defense game, you're in for a treat with Poof. Personally, the game has a little too much going on everywhere for my tastes. It's overload. But I'm still enjoy trying to clear the level objectives. Each level has three objectives to complete. They range from using a certain attack a certain number of times, constructing a number of turrets, surviving a period of time, etc. Once you clear the three objectives, you clear the level and unlock a new ability. Collecting jewels unlocks collectibles like new backgrounds. I used the XBOX 360 controller for Windows with this game. It works perfectly. I think this game would be difficult to play without a controller.			"

												Po√∂f is basically an action defense platformer. It's also a bit crazy: in it you are, after all, a hat-enthusiast doggy with a magic kitten that poops golden eggs. Monsters want the kitten too. The curse is that you will DIE if they get the kitten so, ironically, you need to defend it with your life.Basic idea is simple. Monsters come through doors that are scattered over the level, and you must kill them before they get to the kitten. You can jump on them like Mario or kill them with special items or defensive structures that can be placed in the assigned places. Being a dog you can also poop - yes, poop - golden poop that slows down anything that passes over or through it.Playing along, you get more items and abilities. There's just this one disappointing thing about the game: there's only one map. Granted, I do not think I spoil too much if I reveal that as you complete missions, you will eventually unlock new areas in the one map. These spawn new, usually more dangerous monster types. Also the style changes: you'll be wearing different hats and outfits, as is the kitty and the level's appearance will change randomly between games as well. It won't fool anyone, but is a nice change for the ever-repeating map.Besides the single map, the game is quite fun for a while, and it's rather cheap. If you really get into it, you can try to work your way up the global leaderboards.One last thing: At the time of the writing, Poof's cards are quite expensive. While the recent sale has lowered their price a bit, you can still get quite a large penny back just by selling the cards. Check the market for the current situation though.(Edit: Changed part that was no longer relevant)			"

												This game annoys me - then why do i play it again and again and again? I guess that's the magic in this title. This game manages to pull of the 'I'll just try one more time before i quit' -trick very well. It also doesn't hurt that the graphics look like they were taken from Castle Crashers. UI and Controls are responsive too.  Gamepad works wonderfully and apparently is a recomended tool. Good game design overall - This title could have been just pure rage quit material because as you progress the difficulty starts to become quite hard and missions become so hard that it is not uncommong to fail a mission 1 second before you complete it or die just when you are about to hit off a very hard mission target.  Kudos to the devs on that. I'll be playing this some more for some quick 15min sessions when i want quick action.  "

												It is strange that I saw no let's plays of this game on YouTube. I can define the genre as arcade platformer/tower defence mash-up. It's a funny little game at least for a couple of hours. Graphics are the most awesome in the cutest way, gameplay is interesting, unlocks and achievements are satisfying, and replayability is very high due to various missions that are given to you. Sound is also pretty decent. Unlockable kitty outfits, character outfits, backgrounds and background music tracks, which are randomly changing each round, add look-and-feel variety, which is also great.Well worth the price. I highly recommend this game. (And the pink kitty is so adorable!)			"

												Poof is a fun addictive Action/Platformer thats puts you in the role of a dungeon hero dog protecting a golden laying kitten that attracts monsters. Weird right? Yep, though besides its weirdness this game fills that empty spot inside you that craves something different from all those other games of the now. You'll go from jumping, dodging, and throwing daggers To bashing heads in while wearing a Link constume. The game also does something else alot of games these days dont, it actually challenges you. You'll die! You'll die alot! This game challnges your speed and gamer reflexes. If you dont act fast then your pretty much dead. Humor is actually hilarious and not overdone while powerups and attacks feel like powerups and attacks. This game is a must have and at the price of only seven dollars. If you have the money and you think your good enough to survive then add this game to your library right now and prepare yourself for one of the most addictive and funnest times of your life. 10/10			"

Posted: July 9, 2016
												This one is...really weird. I'm not entirely sure how much it actually counts as a Tower Defense, but I suppose the general concept is the same. It's certainly a unique game, too, if nothing else.Poof's premise is a bit thin. You are a dog knight who has been tricked by an evil wizard (slash hardcore gamer, apparently) into accepting a cat that lays golden eggs. Just like the hen, though, this is an invitation for all kinds of intruders to come running in and attempt to steal it. You have to stop them. This is done in a multi-tiered arena similar to the levels from the very first Mario Brothers game, except here you can jump on enemies in addition to using various items to combat them.This sounds fun, and it is for a little while, but the game's weird progression killed it for me. Instead of normal levels with a certain amount of waves, it uses a mission structure, where you're given three tasks, such as getting a certain amount of points or surviving for a certain length of time. Complete all of them and you get a token you can cash in for a single upgrade. This turns the game into completing the missions, and then inevitably dying since enemies grow strong pretty quickly. So far I've only unlocked one real tower, and since they spawn in like all the other items you might not be able to get them safely, since the platforming and jumping on enemies isn't the greatest, and enemies can come from a lot of positions, and so much as one touching the cat boots you back to the start.There are locked doors around the first arena, so I assume there's more permanent progression later on, but while this is a personal thing, I dislike games where you need to fail a bunch to get better stuff. Poof feels less like a proper game to me and more something you'd use to kill a bit of time here and there. If you pick it up on a sale it might be some mindless fun for a bit, I suppose, but there's not very much to it.			"

Product received for free
												I consider Poof VS the Cursed Kitty as one of those hidden gems that you actually need to play in order to fully appreciate it. The game is a weird mix of action platforming, tower defense and recourse management! And the end result is great!As far as story goes, from the games description on steam you can get all about it. Simple and short as you do not really want a reason to why you play this game or how your character ended in that position.As mentioned above the 3 main features are action platforming, as you need to kill the enemies on screen and your default way of doing so is by jumping on them, tower defense , there are certain buildable points where you can use collected items to build towers that shoot at your enemies (and you as well), and finally resource management. The latter is really interesting, while you play you will collect various power-ups and you can choose how you will use each one. You either use it for what it is, e.g.: throw knifes, heal 1 heart or build a tower, or consume them to lay for a noticeable duration a temporary ‚Äúgolden poo‚Äù that slows every enemy touching it by a lot! These ‚Äòpoos‚Äô are lifesavers and you will have to notice when they expire or get destroyed by a specific enemy, as well to where you lay them!Even if it does not looks like it, the game can be quite difficult. Every attempt starts slowly, with few enemies coming at you, but racks up quite fast as time progresses! You can easily be overrun if you don‚Äôt pay attention and as you progress the games quests, you will unlock additional adjacent areas that not only add to the number of the enemies but to the variety as well! In the long term Poof is quite the challenge!Visually the game is more than pleasing, as all models and animations are carefully made. Bouncing on an enemy will feel fluid with every frame of each move being there and being lovely to watch! The sound effects and the music are great and complete the scaling intensity of the game!The biggest surprise for me was the replayability this little game has to offer while it does not feature any rogue-like/lite elements! It is an excellent time burner as you can play as little or as much as you like, even if you are doing the same thing over and over again.  Your only objective is to finish your current set of quests in order to gain an upgrade point, once you choose an upgrade you receive 3 new quests to complete. While this cycle repeats you will unlock new power-ups, new towers and mechanics as well as increase the games area. Additionally just by playing and scoring points you will unlock cosmetics such as outfits for poof and the kitty as well as backgrounds.However besides all this glory the game has few but pitch black negatives. First it has fixed controls, you cannot change them and you will have to get used to them. Thankfully they are not complicated. But since you cannot change the controls there is no way to review your abilities and the in game help is quite poor in the info it provides. Lastly but most importantly, there are no options! You cannot change resolution/windowed mode/sound-music volume nothing at all‚Ä¶-------------------------------------------I revied this game for the steamified group.For similar reviews and great giveaways feel free to visit http://www.steamified.com "

												6/10 for Po√∂f, may be 8/10 if you are a dog lover.  Good Idea to create a unique game but their is no story and hardly exciting.You just need to save a cat that can spawn a golden egg-bomb. No thing special more than that. So, 2/10 for the story.There is also no option for the screen, full - windows mode. I have a trick, press Alt+Enter to active the game into windows mode. It made this game feel hard to play with the large screen. 4/10 for this interface.Although the game is difficult and terrible, I enjoy a little bit because I feel that it is not like other games.

												I'm a sucker for cute characters and that was the main reason why I bought this game. I really, REALLY underestimated the greatness of Poof. Once I started playing, I couldn't get enough of it. The game started off very simple but as I spent more time on it it became trickier and the missions became harder to accomplish. Don't let looks fool you. This seemingly adorable game is full of surprises, fast-paced action and is devilishly addictive. I keep coming back for more and it's worth it every time.			"

												Think Dungeon Defenders but in platformer version. It's pretty fun, but I would onlky recommend getting it on sale at least 50% Essentially it's the same level over and over again with different backgrounds and skins. As you progress a little further, you unlock a few more monsters and more weapons to use. You take golden poops with your dog to slow enemies down, and attack them with various towers. Fun quick platformer to play in your spare time. Has a bit of an original Super Mario Bro's feel to it. I enjoyed it, you may too. Check it out, :)			"

												Fun little game.  Graphics are colorful, and fluid, kind of like castle crashers.   Its a 2d wave after wave of monsters.  The layout never changes, but the monster's that come out do.  Its labeled as a tower defense, but to me thats kind of a stretch.  Think the original Mario Bros game, with Nicklelodean style graphics and bathroom humor, toss in survival mode and there it is.  The caveat  though, the level ends once you complete the tasks, so it can be under a minute, or over five+.  Another thing is the way the bonuses work.  They follow you, and you have to tell it when to use it.  You can be down to one heart, have five trailing and still die, or have a different power up emerge just as use the heart and still die.  Other than that, i found myself really enjoying the title.value: 3-5 bucks, get it on sale or in a bundle.  7 is just a tad muchage: 5 and up.  Any younger and it might get frustrating, and the potty humor.playability: after about 1/2 hr, it gets pretty grating, but in small increments its fun7.5/10			"

At least it is not one of those stupid games that forces you a keyboard layout for a 2D Platformer with only WASD, just to confuse the classic PC gamer that playes thos games with the arrow keys!.

												This is a game concept seen in countless flash games.  Simple gamplay centered around an upgrade system and meta-missions (i.e. 'survive for 1:30', 'get a combo of x10', etc).  The only differences are, It's probably the worst execution of the concept I've ever played, and I had to pay eight dollars to play it.  There's no free agency, you can only get the upgrades in a set order, you don't gather any sort of currency, you're just given three missions and when you complete the set you get an upgrade.  The gameplay itself is awful.  Shallow and clunky.  There's no real difficulty, just frustration from hits that shouldn't have happened and crap like that.  Don't get it.  Just go play one of the many, many better ones on Kongregate or something.			"

												Imagine a 2D tower defense platformer with no towers (effectively), an unending supply of enemies, and a cat to protect... who is tied up and can't escape and dies isntantly. Poof, at it's heart, is a strategic platformer, with just the right amount of difficulty to make strategy disappear within seconds and reaction dominate the course of gameplay. This makes what could be a simple game change into an addictive experience. The controls, like any good platformer are simple and manageable, and the objective (keep the cat from getting killed) is easily understood and increasingly hard to do.The Pros: Simple, solid, responsive controls.Progressive challenge system to change your gameplay style with every playTimeless look. Retro graphics can be good, but sometimes the more cartoon-y designs are more enjoyable to see.Visibly distinct enemies, allowing you to easily adapt to their strengths and weaknesses.The Cons:A repetative level design. Perhaps the biggest complaint for Poof is its level design. It is one level. This makes it easy to navigate and try to develope a strategy, but it also means you are always seeing the same ledges to jump on/to which can become old to look at or play on. While I reccomend this game, and emphatically tell friends to have this as a quick game to play, I recommend looking at this game more like a casual game. I play poof for a few rounds at a time. Each of the quests has three challenges to it which you can complete individually. This, coupled with the very quick nature of how often you will be overrun, make the game feel better if you are trying to beat a challenge or two at a time, playing for only a half hour or so, and then leave to do other things. The repetative nature of the game means it plays best in short measures, like a game to play while waiting for something to finish processing or to waste a few minutes of time. Play Poof for what it is: a fun, quick platformer that is a nice, casual time-waster. Don't play it hoping to find some epic story. Poof is meant to be for fun, and accessible to everyone.			"

												It's an ok game, but it stopped working on windows 8.1, it crashes on first splash screen and the devs are no where to be seen nor even care. So... save your money.			"

												This game was amazing. 10/10You should buy this game. It's so worth the $7, but if you're unsure wait for a sale then pick it up - you won't regret it.When you start it seems quite easy, but before you know it you're running everywhere for items to save your life. I loaded the game for the first time and once I started I could not stop. It's quick to learn, colourful and runs really well. While it didn't take too long to finish the game, once you've finished you can post scores against other players to try and be best.			"

												This game is IMMENSLY fun, reminds me a lot of Mario for the basic reason that you jump on your enemies and it has powerups. I love how the game is set up and I love the endless carnage of all the golden poos and tesla tower combos!I totally recommend this game to anyone who likes an easy game with plenty of timewasting qualities.

												It is fun, it is simple, it is elegant and has a weird sense of humor regarding things cats and dogs secrete, but, eventually, you‚Äôll get to love both Poof and the poor kitty cat hanging above the well waiting to be protected from the forces of evil.

												Grossly overpriced for what little content there is. Although the game itself is fine, with only 1 stage and no altered gameplay options, it gets stale really fast. PROS:-Cute graphics-Clean controls-Simple ""action tower defense"" mechanicCONS:-VERY little content (2 stages, one of which only unlocks after you've unlocked all the other items)-No alternate modes or altered gameplay options-Grossly overpriced for what little it offers (should be $3 at MOST).
