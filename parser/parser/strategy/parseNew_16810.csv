												Firaxis does something very interesting with their games... They release the game core source code, so abnegated fans can make the ultimate adjustment in the game . Although an ok to bad game in the release, the mod TAC (""The Authentic Colonization"") make this game very close to the classic Colonization game, and it seems I simply can't stop playing it...			"

												Sid Meiers Civilization 4: Colonization is an interesting beast to review, it's a remake of the 1994 ""sister game"" to Civilization using the legendary Civilization 4 engine, but remains different enough from Civilization 4 to feel like a overpriced expansion. I should probably mention that I pretty much only play the fantastic mod ""The Authentic Colonization"" which fixes a lot of issues with the base game and makes it more challenging, but I'll try to keep the review on the actual base game (but the modding community is amazing).+Great graphics, way more detailed than Civ 4 and even Civ 5..which is kind of odd.+Good soundtrack, not quite as great as the original (♫ Jine the calvary♫) or as good as Civ 4 (Baba yetu~)+The early game is way more active than Civ 4, you have to sail around the new worldlooking for good land, the Natives will be angry if you settle to close to them and you can't settle near Europeans at all, this adds a great deal of planning and strategy.+The new leaderheads for the Europeans/Native Americans are fantastic, very well animated and full of personality and character, I personally think Cunhambebe has the best animations out of them all. +Getting soldiers/scouts/pioneers (workers) is way more realistic, instead of training a unit, you actually have to equip a civilian with tools/horses/guns, and newly equipped soldiers will be weaker than battle hardened ones, it's a great system that really makes every military unit matter. +Native variety is good, it features the Iroquois, Cherokee, Apache, Sioux, Aztecs, Mayans, Arawak, Incas and the Tupi, it could use more Amazonian tribes but other then that it's pretty good, some mods add way more such as the Inuits, Shuar, Comanche, Blackfoot, Shoshone etc.+Awesome mods, my favorites are ""The Authentic Colonization"", ""Colonization 2071"" and ""The age of Discovery II"".+/- The amount of Colonies is pretty small, just the English, French, Dutch and Spanish, all have two leaders but are pretty well balanced. Mods add a lot more leaders, such as Russians, Chinese, Danes, Portuguese etc. +/- The game gets a little boring once you find great land and found a few cities and start to get a decent economy, but gets going again in the ""mid-game"" when Natives start to get ticked off at other colonies and start New World War 1. -The warfare system stinks, it's like Civ 4 but with way less actual unit variety and can be very easy to sack enemy cities in the first few turns.-All natives have the same unit type called ""Braves"" and use the same model, yes the Incas, Aztecs, Cherokee and ARAWAK look the same and the model they use is very generic looking, luckily most mods fix that and give really cool custom models for each Native. -Game feels a bit rushed, especially is the ""final battle"" against your home country, just basically boils down to the king bum rushing your cities and you just kill a few of his soldiers and you win.

												A remake of a classic, Civ IV: Colonization could be considered Civ 'Light´. It´s also really worth giving a shot.The game has you colonizing the New World by founding settlements. These settlements are more than just dots to cover the maps with. Rather, each individual settlement is important and needs careful resource and population management. As you expand, you will have to deal with the natives and, more importantly, the royals back home. Although it´s one route you can take, you can do much more with the natives than just smash their heads in - in fact, choosing for cooperation probably provides you with a more worthwhile experience, as these are anything but Civ´s standard barbarians. As for your royals, their demands increasingly test your economy and your colonists' patience over time. This mechanic has been done so well that you really feel you have a good reason to fight when the war for independence finally rolls around -- and winning this war feels all the more rewarding for it. It also means that the pacing of the game is done really well: each stage feels meaningful, not too easy or hard and never a grind.The game tends to be shorter than your average Civ game and can often be finished within a few hours. That makes it an ideal game for a quiet evening or a rainy afternoon. The game has also been around for quite a few years, but still looks just fine.Highly recommended.			"

												This game is fantastic! It has been made with the engine of Civilization 4. I like it way better than civ4. The game tells the story of the colonization of the new world: America! You can randomize the continent as much as you want to make each game very different! The game can be challenging if you want and for those who remember the old colonization game, you will like it alot because its basically the same, but much improved in every way. The strategy is pretty deep and its of course like civilization, a civ buidling game!There is also a fantastic mod out there that adds a crapload of new civilizations (like the russians! hahaha in america!) and a lots of twiddling with the game features to make it even more fun than the basic game already is! This game is a 2 thumbs up!			"

												Truly does and doesn't felt like Civ IV. A worth of your money if you willing to mod it (its so easy though)+ Heavily modified Civ IV and doesn't need base game to run (standalone)+ High amount of strategy for resource and market+ Great Colonization immersion+ Great concept and basic gameplay+ Using Mods make the game almost perfect- Very poor implementation- Lots of micromanaging- Poor Auto AI- Difilcuty is gameplay fairness based and not getting smarter AI based(Note: Using mods might fix most of this problem)Verdict: Other than mod fixable issue i said this is a great game for strategy and historian lover. If you want combination of Paradox ""Victoria II"" and Civ. This game is a must try.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the original Colonization that came out in the early 90s, so my opinion is highly biased.  This game follows through with so many of the things that made the original great.  Choose your own European country to start from.  Find a place to create a new town in the New World and survive surrounded by natives, hostile European competitors and hopefully a Revolution against your home country.  This game is very difficult, if you plan to beat it that is.  The trading system is great, the strategical choices make the game vastly different and overall it mostly copies a winning formula from the original game.  Add to that a great graphical upgrade and an even better musical score, and you can't disappoint the old timers or the newcomers to the game.  Also, you definitely can't complain about the removal of Gamespy and the addition of Steam multiplayer.  This simplifies everything and it works smoothly.  Thumbs up to Firaxis for upgrading all their old games, including Civilization 3 to continue being played.There are, however, some issues.  A few bugs here and there, though not game breaking, and I just found that natives really lacking in this game compared to the original game.  They are there, but they are just too friendly and too easy going.  The European AI does not know where to build cities, nor do they really know how to place their individual population into jobs that produce money and supplies.  It just seems that the AI didn't get a revamp, nor a carbon copy from the original.All in all though, a great classic made even more classic with this latest revision.  Don't miss it!			"

												Very different from Civ IV, just a fair warning that even though it is done in the same engine, it is a very different game. The mechanics for movement and combat are the same, but barring that, things change quite a bit; more micro, less macro. Your units are taken straight from the population of cities, and while in cities they work either tiles or production buildings -- taking raw materials and refining them into finished products. All of your citizens also have a profession attached to them, this affects their yields or combat modifiers; of course in addition to the promotions that they can earn through combat. Money management and trade routes to deliver the raw materials and finished products are a huge part of the game, and constructing buildings are based off of having a supply of wood, with citizens working the lumber mills.I really enjoyed the way that the micro managing was handled, and I wish that a Civ V variant -- mainly for the hex and single unit tile occupation mechanics -- would be made.

												This game is basically a glorified mod of Civ IV and feels like it should have just been another DLC, but since the base game is so solid, so is this game. A lot of the elements common to all Civ games are here; city placement, resource and commerce management and, of course, war and combat. The addition of 'Founding Fathers' adds a new element. 'Founding Fathers' are individuals that join your colony throughout the game and give colony wide bonuses. They replace the 'Wonders' mechanic found in the base game. Some 'Founding Fathers' are clearly better than others and obtaining or failing to obtain certain key 'Founding Fathers' can make or break your game. Victory conditions are narrower here than in most Civ games. Military victory is the only way to win. Due to the limited victory conditions, some leaders are objectively better than others (one of the Dutch colonial leaders has a 25% bonus to production that puts him above all the other leaders no matter what strategy you are using.)This is a fun and challenging game, but lacks the replayability of the base game due to fewer victory conditions, less leaders to choose from and almost no single player content. Pick it up if it's on sale.			"

It's very rate to just press the ""next turn"" button more than two times in a row.The game has a single victory condition so replay value is low compared to other civ games.It will provide 15-20 hours of really fun, well paced gameplay with a tense ending.

												This is an interesting take on civilization.  It's simplified yet harder at the same time.  You must settle in a new land and trade with europe and the local natives which will randomly give you a bonus for delivering a certain type of good.  Towns generate goods based on what tiles you have assigned a worker to.  You have a limited amount of turns to build a sturdy trade network before you must declare independance and defend yourself from europes revenge.  Oh, and don't♥♥♥♥♥♥off the natives.			"

In Colonization you are trying to build the strongest colony by optimizing the skills and functions of your colonists.  I enjoy building an optimized colony more than anything else.  I am actually a bit disappointed when it comes time to declare and then fight for your independance. To me the build up is the funnest part of the game.			"

												The game really is Civ IV: Colonization, in other words, it is neither of both. The gameplay is different than both Colonization and Civilization, and not in a good way. Combat and military units especially are different than Colonization (they operate like Civ IV units) while the economy preserves most of the original elements.The game is like a bad mod for Civ IV; it doesn't capture the charm of either game. The only redeeming quality of this game is the graphics.Bottom line: it's worse than the DOS game and than FreeCol, and if you want Civ IV just play Civ IV. Save your money.			"

You start with one boat, one pioneer, ad one soldier, and from that humble starting point you build a nation. Every citizen has a job, needs to be fed, and many need equipment that you build from raw materials or import from Europe. You have to deal with your King, with rival European colonies, and with the natives.This game is definitely worth at least trying, given its low price. I dare say again, I prefer it to Civ 5.			"

												After playing a lot of the main Civilization IV, I started sampling the different variations that I had received in the same bundle. While my initial impression of the others was ""this seems just like Civ IV,"" Colonization is definitely a different experience. In a sense, your primary enemy is your own motherland rather than competing empires and your mission is to develop your colony quickly and strongly enough to achieve your independence.What makes it interesting is that the focus on trade and infrastructure, rather than conquest, creates a more nuanced relationship between the different factions (which include the motherland, other colonies, and native tribes). It takes a little while to get used to since approaching the game in a Civ IV mindset doesn't lead you down the right path. Once you're used to the concepts, though, the inherent limitations of a new colony and competing resource priorities makes for a lot of challenging, compelling decisions that keep the game interestin			"

												I am only writing this and recommending Colonization because the original one from 1995 was so much better. For starters the Navy in the original actually meant something. Having privateers was actually useful. your opponents were much more aggresive and had way more ships. The new COL barely utilizes it's navy.The MOST important thing about the navy were the battles. In the originaol you capture loot which made the navy battles so much fun and having a privateer was actually useful! Not to mention your opponents would have privateers attacking your ships as well so having a few frigates for defense was actually needed!Next come the Indians.Indians would constantly attack you, and that was a lot of fun. When the attacked settlements they actually stole cargo from you and could steal horses or even guns. This would mean that they could get an easy upgrade if they got lucky. Again, this brought a lot of unpredictability to the game. Indians were able to steel your settlement goods when they raided. Nothing like that in the new COL.The scoring system is very bland and boring in the new COL. All you see is a replay and a score card that doesn't mean anything. The original COL from  1995 showed your score based on how many Indians you killed, the amount of gold you had at the end of the game, colonists etc..(founding fathers)The founding fathers system is a bit boring. The random founding father from the original was more interesting, but it's not that big of a deal.However, whatever happened to the 'Fountain of Youth'? That was a big part of the original and COL.Overall, the new COL is 6/10.I recommend this game only because I recommend the original from 1995. It has a lot of replay value even in 2017. I haven't played it in a long time because I managed to get the highest rating possible on Viceroy. GG, good times.Also, one more thing... the original also had a lot of charm. The new one lacks a lot of the colonial role play.And..... one more thing.... in the original you could have the kind of another nation come in and grant you an elite expiditonary force for a very hefty price when you declare indepence. Mine was from the King of France when I was playing the Netherlands. The package contained Man-O-Wars and lots of cavelry, soldiers, and cannons.			"

												Disregard Civilization, aquire Colonization.Seriously, it's a standalone expansion pack, so unless you have an extra 10 bucks and want to give vanila Civ4 a shot I'd just go strait to this one.---If you're familiar with Total War you will NOT be familiar with this. Rather than focusing on your army and it's compossition, placement and what not, Colonization puts in the role of governer, not general. Micromanaging a number of towns and exploiting the new world's natural resources and dealing with those bloody natives, either peacefully or by blowing their brains out with your supior technology. The overarching goal is to declare independance from Europe, but if you fail to complete the goal in time you still get a score victory for your efforts.As for combat, you have an overly simplified % chance of victory. Though you can't actually take an entire town in a single turn like you can in Total War. Conflict lasts over several years. But unlike vanila Civ4 (And here comes one of the biggest preferences to Col over Civ) unit production is quite involved, so you wont end up having a single conflict over a single city last over a few decades or even centuries.So in a nutshell: War game meets Colony Simulator :p			"

Freecol is also free ftw. I was expecting more out of sid meijers with this but was greatly disspointed.			"

												As much as I loved civ IV, this colonialization remake using the civIV engine really sucks. This is not because of any changes they introduced. There are some good ideas and improvements (such as the system for getting founding fathers), It is even quite fun at the beginning, but the gameplay gets simply dull and boring very fast. Maps are small,enemies are predictable and after a short while there is nothing to do but endlessly repeat the same actions over and over again until you win an the game is finally over (yay!). You can still continue playing after winning the colonial war and try out the new rules that come with your individual constitution (another basically quite nice idea), but i challenge anyone to actually suffer through more than a few extra rounds of that same monotoneous boring gameplay.NOT for original colonialization fans! (those should rather stick to ""freecol"" if they can tolerate bad graphics and the odd bug or two)EDIT: As YUsoMad says in the comment below: Try the TAC(The Authentic Colonialization)-Mod. It actually makes this game playable and enjoyable. TAC definitively deserves a thumbs up.			"

												Civilization 4: Colonization with the amazing Revolution and Religion mod is among the very best strategy games I ever have played (and I have played pretty much all of the best strategy games from the 1980'ies until now). The 1994 Colonization was a classic and one of my all-time favourites, and this version with the RaR mod installed is a vastly improvement over that. This game offers you gameplay that feel quite unique and fresh even when compared to Civilization 4 and 5. The resource gathering and crafting elements of the game are very important, entertaining and at a moderate level of trickiness that keep you engaged and interested, while not overwhelming you. Exploration is fun with the tribes you meet, and backtracking to keep the treasures you discover safe on the return trip to the colonies with docks. The immigration mechanics are very cool, and the trade system is deep and rewarding. Combat is maybe the most civlizationesque part of the game, while the above mentioned elements are very different from the traditional Civ gameplay, but that is not a problem since it is solid and engaging as it is. Diplomacy is also quite ordinary Civ. Conclusion: Definitely recommend this game (with the RaR mod installed), it is absolutely brilliant. Man, I love this game.

												I really enjoy this game even though I've literally never won a match of it. It's just fun playing out that fantasy of setting out into the 'new world' and founding those original settlements and watching them grow. Combat doesn't have a huge role here aside from the end-game requiring you to fight off European forces - probably 80% of the game is to do with economic micro-management. Reminds me of old-school The Settlers in that sense. It's not a perfect game, and I wish they would update it with Steam Achievements and Trading Cards, but I have a lot of fun with it.			"

												What a disappointment! The AI is so bad its laughable. It cheats like no other. Yes, that not the worst thing I’ve seen in gaming, but let me put it to you this way… you have to declare independence from Europe to win. As you increase the demand for liberty and thus independence in your colonies’ cities, your home nation basically shuts down your trade with them, crippling your economy. Not the end of the world, as there are still Native Americans to trade with and other European colonist. But guess what, they don’t get this penalty. Have fun beating the game with that. PS as you need to gear up to fight the large military power of your mother country, you focus shifts from trade to solider training and weapon-smithing. This gets tricky when you have to have you entire colonies’ population at enough liberty sentiment to rebel, which by-the-way is only produced with units taking up food or other valuable space in your cities. Why Sid why did you make this game so bad?! 35% in my book "

												Horriably Made.  An Interesting attempt that is stifled by it's own broken system.  Essentailly it's fun building the economy, but acutally achieving independance doesn't make sense.  Despite having all of the cities at 100% with a vast miltary empire behind you, it will never allow you to seperate. Addtionally you can glitch this game in so many ways which breaks the system.  Don't play this game unless they fix it. Which considering the fact Civ 5 is out, NEVER.			"

												At the initial release, Civ IV: Colonization was not well received.But I think it's aged pretty well. I mean, it's still the only civilization PC game in recent history (+10 years) that has a rather different set-up. Yes, you still work tiles for yields, and yes, you still build units and buildings. But citizens are soldiers, and soldiers citizens. Unlike other civilization games, the population is not just a bunch of numbers you push around to make yields and tiles, but rather are physical units you can move from one city to another, and they become soldiers, workers (pioneers in this game), etc. It's a fun formula, for the most part. You can really specialize cities, with one city doing nothing but gaining food to grow a new citizen that you can then remove and put in another city that does nothing but harvest wood and work a lumber mill to produce boats. And you can manually use wagon trains and boats to carry food, lumber, etc. all over the map.---------------But it's not a perfect formula. For one, while you do this your king will begin raising taxes on you, meaning that what you ship back to Europe to sell will start making less and less money. Hence, this is one of the few civilization games (probably the only one) where as your economy gets rolling, it suddenly becomes weaker at seemingly random moments. And if you don't accept the raise in taxes, then one of your precious exports is no longer able to be sold to Europe (it at least tells you which one will be the victim). Secondly, because of this system, a rather tedious micro-management system begins wherein you build wagon trains like crazy and put valuables in them to avoid them being targetted for the victim-export should you say no to a tax increase.  It is not at all hyperbole to say that I often spend probably 15 minutes over the course of a whole game in which I am just shuffling wagon-trains, loading them up, and parking them (or leaving them parked in the city that originally built them in order to send out elsewhere at when need). Of all the civilization games, this one has the most micro-management of all, even more than Civ V which requires individual units to be moved (as there are no more stacks in that game).Lastly, the war-aspect of the game is pretty weak. The other three colonies (there are only three other colonies no matter map size, though native settlements do exist and sometimes attack you) are often not interested in attacking at all unless you settle right next to them. And the end-game, when you revolt against your king, is basically a tower-defense phase where units sail from Europe and attack the nearest city no matter how unrealistic their odds are of taking it. -------------------I really enjoy this game these days. I was not a fan when it first came out, and it has some issues with excessive micro-management of rather mundane stuff, but it's a good amount of fun. My suggestion is to play Marathon games with this one. I never play Marathon on the other civ games, but here it's practically required in order to have a well-rounded experience. When you play on Marathon, it just qualitatively feels like you get longer before tax increases become excessive and play havok with what you carefully built up. Again, not a perfect game, but if you own Civilization IV and skipped this when it first came out thanks to backlash, then I'd say to pick it up. It's really cheap now, which helps, and is just a great change of pace. I enjoy it more than Civ:BE at the moment, and have played it more and more while waiting for Civ:BE to get its vital first expansion.Overall, I'd give this a 7/10. Certainly not the most epic Civ game ever, but it's fun to play for a Marathon game every so often, and is a nice change-of-pace from the relatively old formula, now, of the others in the series.

												This is a lovingly accurate recreation of the original Colonization in the Civ IV engine.  It's hard to fit a Rizla paper between the two.  That's a bad thing.  What was state-of-the-art gaming 20 years ago has aged terribly.  The ""just in time"" nature of the processing and transport of goods makes for nightmarish micromanagement if you want to be efficient and the dreaded ""smallpox"" exploit from the early Civ games just exacerbates it.  Civ IV is the best of the series - but this is terrible.			"

												Not at all a fan of this game in particular... however, I highly recommend Civilization IV (otherwise). In other words, I do not recommend buying this game for $20... instead, I recommend paying $30 for this along with the other Civilization IV games/expansions, to get the full experience of Civ IV.I can tell what this game has to offer, and it's not for me. Beyond that, it just doesn't seem very well made.			"

												Great game. Until you get to the late game and realize that if you have statesmen in every city and set an auto clicker to fast forward 200 years and you still can not start the revolution. Im sure theres some mechanic at play that I missed but after spending 8 hours building up for an epic battle to find that its just never going to happen really ruined my experiance. Im sure you can have fun with this game but if you choose to play it do some kind of research on the liberty mechanic first. Otherwise you will just end up writing a bad review and feeling cheated.

It's because of the UI. The UI is useless! It is so difficult to use, it's impossible to tell what unit is what or what I'm telling it to do. If they had kept the controls and UI the same, it could have been something great. But it's not.			"

												Ah, good old Colonization, or at least the remake of it. I never got the hang of the original colonization, but this has become one of my all time favorite games. The game has two phases. First you build your economy, then you declare indepencence which really pisses of the mother country, as they would want to squeeze even the drop of sweat from the new world colonists. Then comes the great fight for indepence! ""Give me liberty, or give me death"", as the great orator Patrick Henry said.As I'm not american, prior to this game I didn't know much about american history. But from playing the game I learned so much. The civilopedia has a bunch of historical information about the building, the units and the great historical persons involved in the gameplay. You get to ""hire"" historical persons like Ben Franklin, Pocahontas, Lewis and Clark, John Harvard, Alexander Hamilton, Peter Minuit (who purchased Manhattan for 24$), William Penn (founder of PENNsylvania) just to mention a few.And lastly, a great quote by John Adams mentioned in the opening cinematic:""If we do not lay ourselves in the service of mankind, whom should we serve""			"

												Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good actually, i didn't expect that.The game is very unlike the Civ4, it's different in many ways, not only graphical, but gameplay wise too.  Game starts in 1500-s i think and goes till 1800s, you are doing pretty much the same things as in the previous games of the series, but your goal is not to kick everyone's♥♥♥♥♥ but to gain indipendence from your metropoly. Which is pretty stupid, i think. Whats if i want to stay with my country, like Canada did and get an indipendence later on? This makes game kinda repetative i would say. I still haven't finished a single campaign but when i will, i don't think that i will ever want to play this game again. But the game is still better than Civ4.Graphics:8.5/10 for the time when the game came out 9/10 Sound: 6/10. Wish they had more music and the actors had an actual dialogues. Gameplay: 8/10 nice and interesting but too repetativeSkipping the story, because this is a strategy with no any scenario gamesGame overall:8/10 i gueess. Could be much better if they added more countries and gameplay features, really the game is fun in the start, but later it just gets boring.But i won't lie, i actually enjoyed the game, had some fun playing it, i just don't think that i will want to come back to itShould you buy it?

												As a huge fan of the original Colonization, I have found Civ IV's take on it to be very enjoyable. A worthwhile spiritual successor, IMO. If ever you were a fan of the original, try this version; I don't think you'll be disappointed. And if you never were a fan, this version is still a worthwhile buy. Just prepare for frustration like you wouldn't believe!			"

												Ah, good old Colonization, or at least the remake of it. I never got the hang of the original colonization, but this has become one of my all time favorite games. The game has two phases. First you build your economy, then you declare indepencence which really pisses of the mother country, as they would want to squeeze even the drop of sweat from the new world colonists. Then comes the great fight for indepence! ""Give me liberty, or give me death"", as the great orator Patrick Henry said.As I'm not american, prior to this game I didn't know much about american history. But from playing the game I learned so much. The civilopedia has a bunch of historical information about the building, the units and the great historical persons involved in the gameplay. You get to ""hire"" historical persons like Ben Franklin, Pocahontas, Lewis and Clark, John Harvard, Alexander Hamilton, Peter Minuit (who purchased Manhattan for 24$), William Penn (founder of PENNsylvania) just to mention a few.And lastly, a great quote by John Adams mentioned in the opening cinematic:""If we do not lay ourselves in the service of mankind, whom should we serve""			"

												Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good actually, i didn't expect that.The game is very unlike the Civ4, it's different in many ways, not only graphical, but gameplay wise too.  Game starts in 1500-s i think and goes till 1800s, you are doing pretty much the same things as in the previous games of the series, but your goal is not to kick everyone's♥♥♥♥♥ but to gain indipendence from your metropoly. Which is pretty stupid, i think. Whats if i want to stay with my country, like Canada did and get an indipendence later on? This makes game kinda repetative i would say. I still haven't finished a single campaign but when i will, i don't think that i will ever want to play this game again. But the game is still better than Civ4.Graphics:8.5/10 for the time when the game came out 9/10 Sound: 6/10. Wish they had more music and the actors had an actual dialogues. Gameplay: 8/10 nice and interesting but too repetativeSkipping the story, because this is a strategy with no any scenario gamesGame overall:8/10 i gueess. Could be much better if they added more countries and gameplay features, really the game is fun in the start, but later it just gets boring.But i won't lie, i actually enjoyed the game, had some fun playing it, i just don't think that i will want to come back to itShould you buy it?

												Very fun game! Civ 4 Col is a remake of the original Colonization. In this game, you play as the English/Dutch/Spain/French. Immedietly, it's alarming to me. No portugese, despite the fact they colonized all of SA? These limitations will become more and more obvious as it goes on.As you build your colonies, micromanaging the cities as they grow, you need to get Food (for growth outside of immigration), and several resources. Some are useful to build with (ore, lumber), others can be compared to Civ luxuries to sell and barter with. The economy is very detailed, with resources going up and down in price back in Europe. As you countinue building, you have to fight or buy space from natives, contend with your european colonization rivals, and the Royalty overseas. They will raise taxes, demand large sums of money, and they also serve to help you out when you make bad settlement choices. (It does get annoying once you know what you're doing and the king pops up to tell you you're not settling on the coast, or in a food poor location.)Remember what I said about limitations? Well, there is only one victory condition, which can be jarring to those who come from Civ. You need to win a war of independence. By building bells (i.e culture, which does help borders pop but cities can only use the first 6 tiles around them anyways), you get rebel sentiment. When it gets high enough, and you have enough foudning fathers, you delcare independence and fight off your respective king's forces.All in all, a fun game, however a few things damper it. It's a short game, although with a lot of replayablily. The AI is horrible, unless you install mods. Mods act just like they do in Civ IV, and mods save the game. I reccomend TAC or AODII, which can be found at Civfanatics.			"

https://gamejudges.wordpress.com/2016/10/17/sid-meiers-civilization-iv-colonization/Sid Meier’s Civilization IV Colonization is essentially a cross between Colonization and Sid Meier’s Civilization IV. You collect Funding Fathers instead of researching, have a 3×3 grid around your colony for exploitation, but a 2×2 field once you get enough liberty bells (used to get FF). You have 300 instead of 100 storage per slot, but production values remain virtually the same, at 3 for non-specialist villagers. Trade with Indians is less lucrative than the original and prices in Europe is 3x for ships and artillery. Furthermore, you need a rancher and stables to breed horses and you get no free liberty bells. Units can enter tiles occupied by Indians or villages. This means that trade is simplified and downplayed in this remake.Combat is improved to the point you don’t need to load/save all the time. Converts reduce the number of units in villages and might be demolished with no combat necessary. Units gain experience and have hitpoints similar to Civilization and ships are all different than Col in such a way that they’re all useful. The game is a lot easier and faster to play than the original. The map isn’t even big so you’ll end up with fewer and easier to manage colonies. I like placing colonies where the city function as a canal. This is much easier since you can use a village to move through that is located next to your city. You could potentially make it 3 or more in length if you don’t care about making crippled/small colonies.Verdict:The game is easy and not frustrating. You don’t need to cheat with save/load like you do in the original. It’s fun, but doesn’t capture the spirit of the original. I actually prefer Freecol (free) since it’s closer to the original. But I like this game as a casual game since it doesn’t force you to cheat all the time and has way better graphics and sound.			"

While a bit lacking in content by default, I thoroughly reccomend Civ IV: Colonization given you have one of the overhaul mods installed.			"

												I have loved the other Civ 4 games, (Vanilla, Warlords and Beyond the Sword). This is completely different from the other games and expansion packs. It is pretty difficult compared to the other civ expansion packs, and is focused more on trade and independence, which is the main goal, to get independence from your mother country, (England, France, Spain or The Netherlands/Holland), This game is very long and boring at some points, making it seem longer. The game itself has alot better graphics than the other expansion packs. This is mainly because they took 2 years, rather than about 9 months they took to publish Beyond the Sword and Warlords. The Game does run on the Civ 4 Engine, so it will not run if Civ 4 is not running for some reason. The main goal, indpendence, takes at least 100 turns, if you dont cheat or start making statesmen at the beginning of the game. I do recommend this game if you have played any of the other civilization 4 games, and are pretty good at regular civilization. Thanks for reading, and keep on playing!			"

												Others here have said that the Mod TAC makes the game great - So I started of playing the mod for my first game. Then I noticed it was more than a little flakey, automated trades routes just stopped working, my settlements weren't producing anything, everyone I spoke to said something about ""don't invite me late for dinner"". I took a guess that this was the mod so I started again without it - its like a breath of fresh air!I'm not saying the mod isn't good (I've not played long enough) - and I've already noticed a few things it adds to the game, but at this point while learning how to play I would definatally say its not helpful - theres so many tutorial tips that have helped in the first 30 minutes of play that the mod removed.Overall good game, and a welcome return to Colonization.

												I really love this game. It's a simple version of the exploration and early development of the New World by European nations. A player interacts with natives and other Europeans and decides how they wish to interact, whether with hostility and agression or as peacably as possible. After a colony is set up, it will need to expand it's infrastructure so more land can be acquired nearby. The game is very much simplified, but it is one that I come back to after years of playing when I want to experience colonizing the New World.			"
