												Click here for the video.Grey Goo is a new RTS from Petroglyph Games that removes unnecessary micro and brings back the classic gameplay you may remember from Command & Conquer's glory days.ProsInteresting and varied, asymmetrical factions. There truly is something for every play style here.The tech system limits the player in a good way, giving weight to your choice of tech upgrades without shutting you off from other options permanently.Presentation: Animations, sound FX, voice acting and cutscenes are all superbly polished. While it's not the most high-fidelity game ever made it does look very nice as a whole. Even on the lowest graphical settings the game doesn't look muddy or outdated.The map editor ships with the game at launch, opening up a potentially infinite amount of map variation for the future.The eight maps that ship with the game are, for the most part, asymmetrical, well designed and feel balanced. It feels great playing on non-mirrored maps for once.The campaign and story are above average for an RTS game. The story is supremely compelling with fantastically animated cutscenes (the best I've ever seen) and the campaign offers subtle, interesting variations on the skirmish gameplay through fifteen lengthy missions. It will likely take you a couple of days to complete the campaign and some of the later mission are quite challenging indeed.ConsPerformance: The frame-rate drops with large amounts of units and structures on screen and towards the end of longer matches. Adjusting the graphics options does very little to alleviate this.Only eight maps are available at launch, five 1v1 and three 2v2. I imagine they'll be adding more in the future, but I can't be sure of that at this point.What you need to knowThe game doesn't ship with replay or observer mode features, but they have been confirmed for a post-launch update.Grey Goo doesn't play like StarCraft and thus you shouldn't play it as such. Understand and accept this and you'll be happier for it.If you enjoyed Command & Conquer 3 you'll likely find something to enjoy in Grey Goo.The game supports competitive play with ranked 1v1 and 2v2 matches along with a leaderboard for each.Custom 1v3, 1v1v2 and Free For All games are also supported. The max number of players on a map is currently four.ConclusionGrey Goo is a solid old school style RTS. It has some interesting new ideas and brings back much missed old ones too. It seems that Petroglyph Games has tried to cater to the single and multiplayer communities with Grey Goo; this perhaps coupled with a shorter development time has led the game to feel as if it lacks content in certain areas. That being said, the game doesn't feel unfinished by any stretch of the imagination, though it could use an expansion or a few updates here and there to fatten it up a bit (this is almost guaranteed considering the cliffhanger at the end of the campaign). Grey Goo is a solid and polished foundation for a potentially great RTS.For more Grey Goo and other exciting content check out my YouTube channel, The Roleplay Gamer. "

												TL;DR: It's an RTS with walls. In a gaming world where walls are apparently considered ""so last century"".10/10 walls are love, walls are life. In this game, literally.A spectacular macro-management, not micro-management, RTS based on skill rather than actions per minute, much like petroglyph's older Command & Conquer series when they were Westwood...an exception to this skill-over-APM thing perhaps being the namesake ""Grey Goo"" faction, which is spectacularly original and...strange to play. I won't spoil. It's a fascinating experience to have.Also, uncanny-valley quality (really damn good) cutscenes for the campaign.Outside of that, you have 2 classic RTS styled factions, the humans and the beta. Beta are the easiest to get into and as a result the first ones you play as in the campaign whether you like it or not, as they control much like every other conventional RTS - get resources, build and expand base and outposts, train troops, and fight.The humans, on the other hand, have a big central HQ building and can only sprawl from that using flimsy little connecting wire-like ""conduits"". Hence, they're generally constricted to their main spawning area, leaving harvesters vulnerable when resources have to be gathered from afar. Everything they build MUST be on these conduits, even turrets, so stuff gets cramped fast.Gameplay-wise, this game lies somewhere between C&C and starcraft. It's not as APM or micromanagement happy as starcraft, but also not quite as rock-paper-scissors as C&C was, as all units can, to an extent, engage all others somewhat effectively. Some just do it better than others. There is also a population cap, but that population cap is, well, 200 units in size, so you'll have a difficult time reaching it, if at all. You will also notice a lack of unit abilities, as they...have none. Again, no micromanagement here. There are, however, technologies you can research, with 3 choices for 5 seperate catagories totalling 15 research options - but you can only choose 1 per catagory, so what you pick is how you play. Literally.What also makes this game good is simply the number of options of play style you can have. A lot of games these days encourage you to get out on the field and wreck♥♥♥♥♥♥to get ahead, and while this DOES have advantages to doing that, this is one of the few newer RTS games where you can throw up a wall, plant some turrets, and just build a big army in safety to later watch as the enemy gets steamrolled under the boot of your troops.Maps are expertly designed to be balanced yet asymmetrical, which became very obvious upon downloading some custom workshop maps and seeing the vast difference in quality. I'm not saying workshop maps are bad, and having WS support is a VERY good thing, but the devs know how to map and my god it shows.The soundtrack is composed by Frank Klepacki....you don't need to know anything more.If you don't get anything else, get the soundtrack.Long story short, this is a game where you build a base and send out harvesters from refineries to get a mysterious resources that gives you credits. You use credits to build more buildings and begin training various units. You defend your base with turrets and then proceed with hangars to house your aircraft so you can harass the enemy from afar. Finally, you send your massive army of units to crush the enemy.Sounds familiar, eh?(Unless you're the goo. Then, everything changes...)This is a damn good RTS and you should put it high on your list of games to buy.High recommendation from me.			"

												You mean that I can actually build bases? You mean that you actually need a refinery and silos for your weird alien resource thing? Where is all the ""new and innovative"" complete lack of basebuilding and resource gathering? Why am I not restricted to the ""rapid-pace action"" of a 50 population cap?This game clearly has no idea how to appeal to the action-craving youth of today, it totally lacks innovation and insight into what the gamers WANT! EA would never make anything so disconnected like this..... AND THAT IS WHY IT IS ABSOLUTELY ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING.Please, thank you, yes. I am so sick of idiots trying to ""fix"" the core components of RTSes that make them fun in the first place and producing horrid games like CC4. Grey Goo intelligently keeps all the core elements of a truly fun RTS experience but still expands on them in completely unique ways such as with the Goo faction and the mechanics of the Beta and human basebuilding systems. Basically, I've been a hardcore CC fan all my life until EA gutted it and murdered my dreams. Luckily, Grey Goo has stepped up to fill that void.			"

												While reviews for the game are mixed, likely due to the fairly weak launch it had - I've been enjoying it.It seems like there have been a lot of solid updates to what felt slightly unwieldly on launch and while I'll never play RTS games competitively, it is a lot of fun to hop in and out of.The soundtrack is great too, but then Frank hasn't really had a dull track in any of the RTS games he's ever composed.If you enjoyed RA1 or 2, Dawn of War Soulstorm or even RA3 to a degree, I think this game's a pretty good throwback to the sort of fun you could have in those games.For me at least, this game's really quite optimized now and runs great which is always a pleasant thing given the scale of some of the battles you have in an RTS game.Like most things, I'd check it out on youtube and at least give it an honest look. It's a shame it's still at £29.99, I would honestly gauge a price drop to £15-20 would do this game a favour on the barrier of entry.			"

												If RTS games were cans of beans, Grey Goo would be a generic store brand can of beans.If you tend to like canned beans in general, there is a decent statistical likelihood that you will probably like this particular can about as much as usual.If you don't care for canned beans or already have a favorite brand, the likelihood of you being impressed by this particular can are shall we say low.Personally I'm not a huge fan of canned beans. But every now and then they can be ok. This can was ok too.			"

												+ Balance seems to be solid, nice and asymetric with each race bringing a new perspective to the table at every stage of the game. + Tons of little tid bits and helpful micro/macro controls that really help manage your armies and your base.+ Polished design with no units or technology being truly useless (and all being flexible to some degree) whereas some older CnC games would often have units that never saw real use.+ Fantastic map editor and custom map support.+ AI is so smart it's probably self aware.+ In game encyclopedia offers all the information you'd ever want and then some allowing for quick immersion into the game.+ Simple and nostalgia ridden return to old RTS, this is a good thing.+ Solid voices and cinematic work throughout.+ Great OST with 1 hour and 45 minutes of music, Klepacki makes it.+/- Campaign is 15 missions and devs opted for a more cinematic route of race-to-race mission flow rather than race by race selection and does a great job of getting you into the mindset of each race making transition into multiplayer smooth.+/- Map pool is small for now (8 maps), but growing.+/- Only 4 players supported for now, which may change.- Not optimized for some machines, higher level graphics requirements, development is aware and attempting to address it. *- Sometimes persistent alt tabs out of full screen can crash.- Region locks, can be partially fixed with steam client adjustment but this can cause absurd lag for some people depending on geography. **- No observer or replay function, though as of 1-27-2015 they are hard at work at implimenting it.- PC release only* - They are aware of the optimization issues and attempting to fix** - They are aware of the region restrictions and matchmaking bugs and are attempting to remedy them as wellFinal Rating: 8/10I would recomend buying this game especially if you were a fan of older CnC games, it has alot of potential for growth and is a good experience overall with the gameplay being more than enough if you can make it past some technical problems. The price can be a bit steep for some however so I also recomend waiting for sale just as long as you get this game.			"

												What a game! It's apparent the developers have spent a lot of time polishing Grey Goo, it feels polished and robust and very pretty to look at! The optimization is fairly okay-ish, I've encountered a few FPS hitches and notable slow down when reaching the unit cap in skirmish but it doesn't hinder play at all. I use a half decent PC so I can imagine it being a monster on a lesser machine. As for the gameplay, to me it feels like a twist of starcraft and C&C, but more so C&C with a similar awesome soundtrack. Many have said that the unit roster and buildings are fairly shallow but it feels just right in my opinion. You have tech upgrades of which there is 3 in each category with the ability to switch them out on the fly at a price giving one an edge in a certain area when one needs it. It feels like CoH/CoH2's in game level-up-n-choose-a perk feature but useful. I have already found myself needing to use it. The cinematics are very well done, really good to watch and follow the story, even if it is very Starcraft inspired. The balance between the Beta and the Humans feel pretty spot on, can't say anything for the Goo yet as I have yet to tinker with them.I'm a few missions in, playing on hard, it feels about as hard as it should be. I had to replay a mission or two to figure out the correct build order and way to get stuff done. It's a lot of fun. The tutorial is excellent, teaching the player how to use stuff as you play the game and describing most things with detail. Not so many maps for skirmish/MP but the devs have said to be supporting the title for a while to come so will have to wait and see, in the mean time there is a map editor and steam workshop support to get on with. Definitely the finest and most well built RTS we've had for years!			"

												Haivng been a classic Command and Conquer fan, I'm glad the old westwood guys are trying their best on finding a new RTS series to hopefully continue on from. Grey Goo is a strange title to start, gameplay is decent and overall performance on my end is fine (running at max settings and haven't had any issues or bugs). The breakdown----------------Performance - Good - Again on my rig, had no issues and was playing on max settings. The only issue I did have was a bit of frame drop during the animated cutscenes but it's nothing game breaking and can be fixed with a few updates. The maps look impressive with nice visual effects here and there but nothing mind blowing new. Gameplay - There is 3 factions, Humans which have their bases connected through a powerline system, Beta who are your alien/human type race which their bases are connected through hubs (think of Starcraft terran but with all their buildings stuck to command centers) and then there is the goo....the goo is the one faction that stands out as there isn't any faction like it from any RTS that I can think of. The goo operates as a living base, it starts off as a big blob and from there collects resources as it moves around, once it has enough resources you can divide the goo into units or another big blob. The cool thing is the goo can climb over mountains and also attacks by grabbing and eating the enemy forces (really neat watching infranty get sucked in), it's really good for players that aren't big on base building and are pure offensive types as this moving,  defensive organism is the best for those player types. The combat is very basic, units are nothing mind blowing and most seem familiar, however the epic units which each faction has is awesome, think Supreme Commander 2 super units. Controls are nicely done and easy to use, however there isn't much micro managing when it comes down to forces, they have no special abilities only upgrades made at main base and that is it. Overall the gameplay is your standard RTS, however there is a 200 unit cap...which is kind of sad coming from the Westwood guys (come on you guys are the ones who started the no unit cap...massive army RTS games...bring back that feel..I love having massive airforces and infantry against another player going all out in the middle of the map and once the battle is over...looking at the wreckage , holes and fires from our epic massive assault)Music - AWESOME , I love the music as it's from the original Command and Conquer Artist. Some songs are kind of strange but overall they give you that nice tone to listen to...also you can pick your song track which I miss...like come on RTS games this feature was made back in 1998 why is there no option to pick your track during missions.Story/Missions- the story is interesting at the moment (currently at level 3), I will update this when I finish all faction stories. However the missions are straight forward, protect this , kill that and do optional objectives. Issues - So far only a few frame issues during cutscenes but other then that had no issue with missions/optional objectives , graphics and combat. Everything checks out. I haven't tried online but did play a bit of skirmish with no issues and the A.I seems to be working properly with default settings. Should you buy this?: the answer is rather difficult as there isn't anything really fresh and new that hasn't been done before besides the one new faction goo. The price is fair (if your complaining about $50 or $60... then wait for a sale.. you can't have everygame $10 or .99, what is even fun is these same individuals don't have issues buying $5 to $10 dlc weapons or map packs for PayDay 2 or COD) for what it is. If your a command and conquer fan , Empire at war or Universe at War then you will feel comfortable with this. I played all 3 games/series and this one is another one I'm enjoying and glad to add to the collection. If your a starcraft player, you might feel upset over the lack of micro-management and special abilities. The game seems more designed for basic RTS players of throwing your force against the enemy lines in hopes to break through. And if your unsure either way or feel scared over the $50 or $60 price tag, wait for a sale. I do recommend giving it a try one way or another.Also...for your classic Command and Conquer fans....this game allows you to build walls!!!! Its about time :D			"

												It's good, not sure it's full price good, but it's good. Price point should have been closer to 39.00. Solid C&C style RTS. I like that the units don't have special powers that have to be kept up with. (why I suck so bad at SC2)That being said, it's still pretty challenging in it's own right, just more straight forward, which I like. "

												Besides the low multiplayer population, this game is excellent!  The artistic design is done by Weta, the same studio that did prop design for the Lord of the Rings movies.  The music is by Frank Klepacki, the same guy who made the music for the Command and Conquer series.  Petroglyph, the company that produced the game, is also made up of a lot of ex-Westwood employees who formed Petroglyph after EA dissolved Westwood.  Tbh, I prefer the storyline and gameplay to Starcraft 2's.This game is definitely worth buying if it's on sale; even if it isn't on sale, it's still good.			"

												Never written a review for steam before, but wanted to express how much I have enjoyed this game so for. Grew up playing the old school RTS, Warcraft, Warcraft2, Starcraft, Age of Empire's 1 & 2 and everything in between. As time has progressed I have always felt that the RTS genre was dying with the exception of Starcraft 2. Love the game, a solid testiment to the older RTS style. Players that grew up with Starcraft 2 maybe be frustrated at the slower pace, but anyone that grew up in the hay day of RTS will love it.			"

Let's start with bad and work our way up to the good, shall we?What does Grey Goo do wrong? Not much, to be frank but there are a few things that could've been made better. First off the differences between the two humanoid factions are mostly cosmetic even though there are subtle differences in how units work, unit stats and general playstyle. Particularly base building is vastly different. I just feel they could've been diversified a little bit more.No replay. EDIT: Replay is now in the game (2016-02-15 edit)The lack of a proper replay function hurts ranked play and stymies people who want to improve by watching their games from an outside perspective. This is one thing I believe should be prioritized.Performance.The game runs like crap on a lot of people's hardware. There's been a lot of performance patches lately that have dealt with most of those cases. I personally still have a wildly fluctuating framerate in menues and videos, but gameplay is mostly buttery smooth.Lack of content.While I liked the shorter campaign (16-ish missions) some people don't and the lack of multiplayer maps is also somewhat hurting the game, even though I personally find them to be enough. Learning a few maps and finding ways to use the maps to your advantage is a lot more fun than having yet another bloody map every time you play. But it's a con, so I'll list it. Also see map editor.Not intuitive balance.While this is hardly unique for Grey Goo, it's still a thing that drives people up the wall. At first glance, Goo's artillery can seem overpowered as hell with their HUGE range and potential healing. In addition Goo's splash-tank upgrade turns enemy armies into paste (no pun intended) against an unprepared opponent. Human's artillery also works as mines? OP! Etc etc. Grey Goo is fairly balanced, but it takes a lot of playing before you actually realize this. Early on it just seems broken.Difficulty.I dunno why I'm listing this as I've beaten the campaign on hard on the first try. But I've seen billions of threads about this. Grey Goo is apparently hard.AI.The AI is, for the most part, good and will put up a decent fight against a middling level player. It has some issues though and can sometimes break down completely and just ""sit there"".Price.Grey Goo is overpriced in todays market. It's quite worth the price, but it's not going to sell well with such a high price tag.Okay, now for the good stuff:SoundtrackThe soundtrack is really, really good. Even I, who normally shun everything remotely dubstep-y, can appreciate the Goo soundtrack even though the Humans have the soundtrack that I personally like the most. It's also written and performed by legendary Frank Klepacki of the C&C games.Graphics.Grey Goo looks gorgeous, not just in gameplay but in the cutscenes and menues. Top notch quality all around.Gameplay.I personally love the anti-micro pro-macro style of RTS that Grey Goo is. I detest micro-heavy RTSs with a passion and am so sick of Starcraft Clone #451 coming out. Grey Goo makes a return to the strategic part of RTS. Army composition, economy and positioning plays a big role here and you'll rarely be ""caught out"" by lacking twitch skills.Online capability.The maps are great to play on, the factions seem fairly balanced (although I'd argue that Goo can be somewhat underpowered) and the connectivity is rock solid. I've never had a single disconnect or even lag in a single match so far which is impressive seeing as I play almost exclusively with people ""across the pond"".Goo.The faction as a whole. It's unique, yet recognizable. Anyone who has played Zerg or Tyranids will recognize the frantic ""zerging"" style of gameplay, but at the same time the lack of bases, or rather mobile bases make the Goo a very unique faction.Story.Some may call the story basic, but I personally enjoyed the story and how it was told very much. A lot of likable characters as well so this gets my thumbs up.AI.I list this in pros as well, because the times when the AI does play well, it plays really well. It's solid enough to give me a bit of a challenge on Hard, but it's of course nothing compared to a human player.Support.The developers have been releasing regular performance patches, and as of time for this review to be posted, they're also working on their first big balance patch. The ongoing support means this game has a lot of lifetime ahead of itself.So do I recommend Grey Goo?Hell yes, I do. Grey Goo is the best RTS to be released in recent years. That doesn't mean that Grey Goo is the next coming of Messiah in RTS gaming. No. It's a pretty iterative continuation of the C&C style of games. But it does it well and it's a solid enough game for me to recommend it. I still have tons of fun playing it and I expect you will too. If you are hesitant, wait for a sale. It's a pretty hefty price tag after all.			"

												A must have for any fans of RTS. A modern spin of of the classic C&C franchise, this game brings RTS back to its base building roots with an easy to comprehend UI. The helpful UI and gameplay design, reduces the micro intensive gameplay found in modern RTS such as starcraft 2. This leaves a focus for strategy without babysitting your base or units, however, a certain degree of speed is required to excel this game. That being said, it is a simple game but hard to master. (edited) The game's AI on hard (even on normal) provide certain degree of challenge in the campaign, while it suffer in skirmish.The 3 factions are uniquely different, this gives an asymmetery to the game. I would not provide a detail description about the factions, but rest assured, they are fun to play and all have a unique twist to them (for example, humans are the most technological advanced race with teleportation and drones to do their fighting for them).The campaign and skirmish maps are well crafted. (edited) Although the map pool for skirmishes are small, a map editor was included to allow the community to develop more exciting maps, the devs themselves mentioned they will include community crafted maps in the future (if they are good). The graphics are well up to standard for modern times, even the cutscenes inbetween missions have almost realistic CG potrayal of the main cast of the game. The soundtrack of this game deserved to be mentioned, it is fantastic as it is written by composer Frank Klepacki (his original work contribute to the soundtrack of command & conquer and even the infamous Blade runner). With that being said, the scores found in this game are well-crafted, and you can even customise what soundtrack to play during your skirmishes with the in-game jukebox. In summary, this is a game worth getting for the price. I only hope that this game doesn't underperform in terms of sales as it wasn't being advertised well. This is because we deserve more well-made RTS in the market with a return to games which focus on base building and strategy.			"

												Grey Goo is a game that brings us back to the classical RTS playstyle with slower gameplay and base building orientation. This game is basically a mix between C&C games, Universe At War: Earth Assault and Earth 2160. If you come at this game with an open mind you will enjoy it imensily. If you expect everything to be exactly as in C&C then you will be heavily dissapointed.This is a real throwback to what RTS games once were about and I hope that will be again. The UI in this game is one of the most non intrusive I have seen in any RTS game to date. The campaign is challenging on hard but passable. The missions are designed very good and provide a very long singleplayer experience. I would say that you can get easily 15-20 hours out of it. Skirmish offers quite a good AI that really knows how to counter players moves. The ressource in this game the so called Catalyst is mined on Catalyst/Veins fields by Extractors which are replenishible like Tiberium fields in C&C games. The three faction are really distinctive. The Humans although a full turtling faction are capable of carrying out early rushes to disturb enemy eco production. What you need to realise is that base buildings in this game are hard to destroy so you have ample time to rebuild some of your forces that get destroyed. This game is not like SC2 just about how you Micro. Its about how secure your supply lines are and how secure your production is. So it does not matter if you loose your army since you can field another one in do time. Basically its a macro game. Humans are very adaptible when it comes to base defenses since they can teleport any building to any place on the conduit lines.Betas as a faction are quite adaptive and offer a nice mix between a turtling and offense faction. They may look similar in playstle to Humans but they do offer faster counterattack options. And the Hand of Ruk rocks. Goos really are a faction that is made for the fans of Micro management. It is important to note that Goos need some time before they can produce enough force but when they do then you will surely get a nice fight.Also just to point out that the Map Editor is already included in the game since some people think that its not there. Its in the games Steam folder (PgPublicTerrainEditor).Anyway I recommend the game to any UaW, C&C and Earth series fans but as said this is a new game that includes a lot of different concepts so you need to be open minded to it.

												This game is a well developed asymmetric RTS game, featuring 3 vastly different factions.The humans are network based, all the constructs are linked and the game-play is heavily advantagous for those who prefer the turtle approach thanks to the turrets and the compact design their playstyle promotes. They are also the only faction capable of teleporting 6 units at once to any spot on the map where you have visibility allowing you to quickly reinforce troops if needed. Their elite unit sends a laser beem straight forward in a line, damaging any enemy ground unit (imho. this is the weakest elite unit, but they have air-superiority anyways thanks to their airplanes and how small their storages for the airplanes are).On the completely opposite side this this is the Goo, the playstyle of the goo focuses on aggressive hit-and-run tactics, their elite unit can cause serious havoc and is also able to climb any obstacle and destroy enemy buildings and units by simply being around them. They are very strong if coming in a pack and when lacking form they can devour an entire base by simply being there. That said, their forms (units) do have a lot of advantages such as range, ability to target airplanes and pure damage.The goo has no structures, they are a fluid faction in every meaning of the word.The Beta are most normal of the factions, specifically said by the Devs to be intentionally so for new players to get used to the game, but they are still very strong and definitively a force to be reckoned with. Their elite unit is a walking production facility that sends out miniature nuclear bombs and is able to attack any close-range enemies by having units mounted ontop of it. This is one of the big strengths of the Beta, some of your units can mount walls and the elite unit, allowing you to create a strong permimiter that is very hard to break through.If you then decide to go on the offensive, the elite unit will help you take down most resistance, having what is probably the strongest of the elite units in the game.As for the campaign, it is very well made, although, it is a bit short, allowing you to get used to each of the factions while also deliviring a great story that they have confirmed will be expanded.Note: It will come through DLC.Now, on a more negative note, while humans are strong, they often feel unflexible as you might not be able to expand anywhere due to it not always going so well building uphil and some areas are just blocked off for building. For the Beta, that just means you place it somewhere else, for humans, it means stop.Also, the game, at least so far, allows for only up to 4 players, meaning you can't even have a 3v3 with one of each faction on each side.

												It's been a long time since we've had a good old school sci-fi RTS, wasn't it?Well, if you are even a tiny bit into RTS genre - Grey Goo is definitely worth checking out.It feels and plays like C&C in its best days. It looks gorgeous. It runs relatively well (aside from that weird framerate I have in menus and occasional drops when there are too many units, but devs are already aware of the problem).Pick one of three factions and destroy your enemy. Each of the factions has almost completely different playstyle.Humans (or Alpha) are tied to their base. They have to build conduits that carry power to their buildings. But conduits are pretty fragile. That forces you to be very careful about extending your base - you'll need to guard every building and conduit you have. To do that, you can use a variety of turrets that work from conduit (that's a unique Human feature).Beta (aliens) are slightly more mobile than humans. They construct all the buildings as attachments to either the HQ or hubs. The hubs can be built pretty much anywhere in the world, thus making it pretty easy to expand your influence. You still have to guard your satellite hubs, but it's pretty easy to do with units mounted on walls (that's a unique Beta feature).And then there Goo. It does not have bases, it's not tied to anything. It's just a Mother Goo and her children. You only way to survive is to replicate and capture each and every resource pool on the map. And then replicate again, morph into an army and kill everyone.Oh, and every faction has it's own unique Epic Unit, which is, well, pretty epic, but slow.It's a bit sad that Humans and Beta have such a little number of differences. But they are different enough to keep the gameplay fun and varied.There are as well a lot of modern age takes and improvements in the game.There's quite much less micro than say in Starcraft 2 - the games wants to do a lot of things for you (of course, you can pick to do most of them yourself, but it's not necessary, AI does a pretty good job at it).For example, there are no workers - buildings are constructed by either spaceships or they just warp in.The harvesters are as well managed automatically by the refinery, you don't have to worry about building optimal number of them - just about defending them from enemy.And QWERT-shortcuts that was most likely inspired by DOTA-like games allow you to quickly build new units or building even when you are away from you base. It's quite much easier than microing in SC2.The AI in game is pretty good (or maybe it's me who's terrible) - I was able to play against it without terribly losing only on easy. So, if you are skirmisher - you will probably love to play against it.Netcode seems to be working OK too - tried a couple of MP games (but lost terribly, once again :D).And, really, aside from that framerate bug that my machine experiences for some reason, I don't really have anything else to complain about. Game is rock solid RTS.Watch the detailed overview in the video below:

												EDIT 16/3/2016Regional locks have been lifted and the game now has an option for ""worldwide matches"". While ping may be a concern, most games I have played online have not plagued me with packet loss or lagspikes. Game has been optimized for slower PCs and newer machines alike. Gameplay balance is constantly being fixed.Listen up, other game developers. This is how GreyBox and Petrogylph does things: exactly what the fans want. Thumbs up to the folks over at GreyBox and Retroglyph for the continuous updates and connections to the fans. Thank you so very much.EDIT: Issues regarding region lock, game optimization and gameplay balance are being fixed as I type. This is the prime time to purchase this classical RTS and get to commanding![Original Post]This is my first time writing a review on Steam but hell, this game deserves it.Grey Goo is astonishingly fun to play, has decent AI, and good game mechanics. It is a good game overall, sadly I am speaking at launch, and there are loads of issues waiting to be fixed.First off, the game is currently not fully optimized, and it lags the hell out of slower and even newer pcs.Secondly, the game is region locked, so you can't play online if you're stuck somewhere outside of players who have this game.Lastly, Menu screen are extremely laggy in-matches, which is probably due to optimization errors.Would I recommend this game? Absolutely.Would I recommend you buy it now? The answer is No. wait till the issues are fixed and you'll get one hell of an RTS.			"

												A solid attempt at the old school RTS genre long thought lost, it gives me hope of future titles of this calibre in the future.  An interesting story, excellent soundtrack, beautiful cinematics and fluid gameplay keeps you interested although i personally didnt feel as invested in the charactered as i'd hoped.  Having played the campaign and dabbled in some 1vs1 online matchs i was pretty happy with what i experienced SP and online.  Matchs online are not as manic as perhaps games like Starcraft 2 were every second is precious which allows for more casual longer matchs like the RTS times of old.  In conclusion every old school rts fan who enjoyed Command and Conquer and its clones should definately invest in this title.  The older generation who where around for the orginal C&Cs will be almost sent back in time, remmebering the excitement and feels of the experience. Get it.			"

 Grey Goo Definitive Edition Genre: Real-time StrategyDeveloper: Petroglyph GamesPublisher: Grey Box Introduction Grey Goo is a new Real-time Strategy (RTS) game by Westwood Studios veterans Petroglyph Games. Those familiar with Westwood would be aware of their impressive track record.  As you may have already read, Grey Goo feels like an early RTS, however it introduces many new ideas differentiating itself from its predecessors. There are three distinct factions to play as (the standard number for RTS titles today), the versatile Beta, the defensive Humans and the aggressive Goo. I'll take you through my rundown of the game assuming you're an RTS fan; I'll be making a few comparisons throughout. Features What's that? You're not familiar with RTS games? Don't worry, Grey Goo more than explains itself with many tutorial videos before jumping into one of the game's two main modes, Campaign and Skirmish. Campaign is the single player narrative featuring multiple customised scenarios whilst Skirmish allows you to play against either human or AI opponents in free-for-all or team battles. Replay and Observer modes were added several months after the game's launch, a staple for the competitive multiplayer types. It's good to see the developers were not too preoccupied with competitive multiplayer, offering a lot of single player content. Plot-wise, Grey Goo does not follow standard sci-fi stereotypes creating an identity of its own (for example: the Humans are the most technologically advanced faction). The campaign is set on a tropical planet known as Ecosystem 9 and its compelling, 15 missions long and legitimately challenging (not merely an elaborate tutorial). Be prepared to click the restart mission button a few times. Whilst the campaign is challenging, not too many missions overstay their welcome, they'll hold your interest. The campaign takes you through each faction, the Beta (the most conventional one for RTS veterans), Humans (defensive) and Goo (aggressive). There have been suggestions that the Beta and Humans are too alike. They are somewhat similar, but have enough differences to distinguish themselves. For instance, the Beta have more offensive options and are far more mobile than the Humans whom must use power conduits to power their structures and stationary defenses as well as expand. The Goo is the stand out faction solely for its originality. Instead of constructing a base; resource gathering and unit construction are left to the Mother, a large Goo that essentially acts as a mobile all-in-one base that consumes everything in its path (including enemy structures). Each unit has a purpose and remains useful throughout the whole game, even early game ones. The factions each have their own equivalent of the scout, tank and artillery. Other more exotic units include the Goo's Bastion (a moving wall) and Dweller (a subterranean unit that explodes when enemies are nearby).There are no super weapons such as Nukes or Ion Cannons here, instead replaced with ""Epic Units"" similar to those in Command and Conquer 3 encouraging the construction of large armies to back them up. The horizontal user interface is well designed, taking cues from more recent RTS/MOBA titles including hotkey layout. Another idea borrowed from MOBAs is the ability for units to hide in brush. Units may also be auto-queued in order to keep battles big and interesting. Resource collection, construction and unit creation have been beautifully streamlined. Resource collection in particular has gone from babysitting harvesters with iffy path finding to a ""set and forget"" sort of thing. The developers also opted to go with Supreme Commander's income system which translates well into this title. There are numerous technological upgrades each faction may choose from, they are divided into different categories, however you may only select one in each which gives more weight and responsibility for your choices allowing for some army tweaking depending on which strategy you wish to employ. Grey Goo may not be as fast-paced as Starcraft 2 but is still fast enough to keep players on their toes. Combat isn't too deep, more so emphasising unit composition over micromanaging a handful of units like in more recent RTS games. Another trend in recent RTS titles was their encouragement of aggressive tactics and punished anyone who did not expand quickly enough. Defensive strategies are, at the very least, viable in Grey Goo. Presentation The visuals are impressive, you may max the game out even on a modest PC. There are notifications and detailed tooltip text boxes for everything keeping you in the loop throughout the battle. Each faction is well designed, from the Beta's mechanical, animalistic walkers to the Humans hovering, highly advanced drone arsenal. The campaign cinematics look great too, so great that Petroglyph may have even outdone Blizzard in that regard. Sound Design Everything either has a sound cue or announcement. There are no issues with the announcer or units trying to talk over each other (the announcer usually takes precedence) although you may hear them repeat themselves over and over (""Wall under attack...""). Units become irritated when constantly selected (a throwback to Starcraft) and let you know when they're in combat or have defeated an enemy. It's small details like these that demonstrate how much the developers cared for their product. The game's score was composed by Frank Klepacki (Command and Conquer/Dune). It's great. Longtime RTS fans may hear echoes of his past work in this game, in particular Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun and Universe at War: Earth Assault. Each faction has a unique, dynamic soundtrack that changes depending on what's happening on screen. Issues Before describing the existing issues Grey Goo has, I should note that Petroglyph have since addressed a couple of problems it had upon it's release. Multiplayer disconnections are now, at the very least, less frequent and additional graphics options have been added. The game has also been properly optimised meaning the title screen no longer stutters and the game simply runs smoother in general, even on a PC that does not quite meet the recommended system specifications. True to their word, Petroglyph also added more units, multiplayer maps and another faction in subsequent updates. On to the issues...Currently, there is no option to play an eight player skirmish match. Multiplayer is region locked, meaning you may only play with others within your part of the world. In order to play with other countries, you must change your download region in Steam, however this may result in a lot of lag depending on where you live. Unit pathfinding is wonky (particularly epic units), each one requires a bit of micromanagement to do what you actually want it to. Satisfying audio feedback from past RTS games, such as Command and Conquer, are not present here (no big chunky explosions when laying waste to an enemy army or base). Unit selection quotes are forgettable, nor do said units gain any visual indicators of particular upgrades unlike other games in the genre. I was also hoping to play with some campaign specific units only to be left wanting (there is one campaign specific unit in the Emergence Campaign downloadable content). Summary Usually, I would have waited for a sale before picking this up (this is Steam after all). But I've been waiting for a real RTS on PC for a long time. I couldn't wait, I wanted in from the ground up and wasn't disappointed. In my opinion, Grey Goo delivered. It's a creative, polished and genuine RTS title that fans of the genre will enjoy. Another reviewer noted most of Grey Goo's negative reviews were linked to it's weak launch. Petroglyph have since proven their dedication to their product by giving it the support it needed. Now it just needs more players...			"

												WOW. Just like... wow!!This game really snuck up on me. I hadn't even heard of it until I saw it in the ""New Releases"" in the strategy section here on Steam. At first I thought it was an Indie game, but its not. Its a monumental game, with a long rich single player campaign.This game harkens back to the glory days of RTS, when every other PC game was RTS, and before cross-platform console games became the fad... and virtually spelled the end of the RTS genre. You see: its very hard to play RTS with one of those archaic gamepads, but rather than establish better peripherals for console (like mouse and keyboard), game companies simply dropped titles that didn't play well on console, so that they could release on Xbox and Playstation and PC with one giant game and get the largest userbase. Greed trumped making good and interesting games, and so everybody started making FPS.I've gone off on a tangent, and I apologize... but there is a reason. Before the consoles became a serious gaming platform, RTS got a AAA+ treatment from publishers and development studios. They were graphically amazing, with fully rendered cutscenes, long rich campaigns around interesting stories, great dialog presented by great voice actors, well-balanced but with challenging AI (etc). And then it all went away (except for Starcraft 2 and some Space RTS's), leaving the RTS genre primarily being advanced by nostalgic Indie developers.... at least: until now. This game is amazing. Its basically the game that I would expect to see from all major publishers if the Console fad hadn't taken off. Here's a more detailed breakdown:---- THE GOOD ----* GRAPHICS : Beautiful game. Awesome scenery filled with lush alien forests and swamps interspersed with strange alien machinery. The architecture of the buildings is imaginative and interesting, including the base buildings. Unit design is also interesting, with the human drones looking more like works of art than military machines. And of course there's the goo creatures: which are amazing to look at and scary. Explosions and laser bolts are quite beautiful too.* FULLY RENDERED CUTSCENES AND BRIEFINGS : I feel like I'm playing Starcraft! Only... Starcraft had mostly in-engine cutscenes, not full renders. So Grey-Goo takes it one step further! After each mission the player is rewarded with a 30-second (or so) cutscene made with love. Its film-quality (no exaggeration). Then the next level briefing is also fully rendered. It all looks like full-performance capture (with very good actors). The detail is such that you can see the pores in the alien's skin. The races have distinct looks and styles of dress, and even change their clothes from mission to mission. Really big kudos. It helps draw the player in big-time.* AI : The AI is challenging. Some levels can be very difficult, but usually this means you're missing some trick to circumvent a defense. While the AI is not quite human-quality, that is mitigated by the AI starting the level with established bases. So its not really a factor. Additonally, a difficulty setting allows you, if you do get stuck, to drop down to an easier level AI and not punish you too much.* ASYMMETRICAL STRATEGY : Especially around base-building, each race has a different build style and strategy, which adds variety between the races and gives some insight into their culture.* STORY : The story is really great so-far (I haven't completed the game), with interesting sci-fi concepts that are very believable (in fact: based on real theories). The dialog is great, and the voice acting delivering that dialog is great. Its all very immersive. Such that I played 11 hours straight today.* EPIC UNITS : Epic units are always fun. Its hard to get them (as it should be), but once you have them, they're very impressive and fun, soaking a lot of damage while independently targeting numerous enemies and blasting them away. In one mission you get to have 2 at once... twice the slaughter... twice the fun!* OPTIONAL OBJECTIVES : It adds a lot of replayability, especially for us full-completionists.* THE HUMANS ARE SUPER-ADVANCED : This is more of my personal preference, but the humans in this game are a bit like the Protoss in Starcraft. Lots of super-clean lines, strange alien architecture and glowy bits... and I like that. Its a nice departure from the old trope of ""OMG advanced aliens coming to kick our butts"". But also, for the humans to have a bit of an alien feel as we become super-advanced... is really quite an interesting idea.---- THE BAD ----* No VETERANCY SYSTEM : While I am sure the developers intended this as a throwback to old RTS, veterancy was eventually added to most games in that genre, and for good reason: otherwise the strategy tends to be to make waves of units and send them on suicide missions. Because there is no veterancy in this game, that tactic has been reborn (with some variation). It would be nice if there were a reason to keep your units alive, and perhaps make healing them easier.* THE CONTROLS : The controls are generally pretty good, but there are some weirdnesses like... if you select a unit and then the repair wrench, the unit is still selected. So you think you're controlling the unit but you aren't. Also like... the aliens have these great big battleships that you can assign soldiers to hop into and man gun-turrets... which is awesome! The problem is: there are 6 turrets, so they mostly cover the entirety of the top of the ship. But clicking on them selects the _unit_, not the _ship_ that they are riding in. This makes selecting the ship frustrating because you need to make sure you're clicking the back of it, or else it will select one of your gunners. Generally I learned just to assign the dreadnaught ship to a hotkey. But it was a minor annoyance.* THE SOUND : While the sound is really good, including the music, it fluctuates wildly. If I have the cutscenes at normal volume, ingame is very loud.* NO ""DO YOU WANT TO EXIT"" : Minor annoyance, but in a level with optional objectives, if you complete the primary objective, uncompleted optional objectives come up as _failed_. I'd prefer that the game tell me something like ""Primary objective complete: are you ready to exit?"" Or at least a ""Complete primary objective? (Some optional objectives are still active!)""* UNITS AREN'T SUPER-INTERESTING : While this contradicts what I said above a bit, I do have one qualm... there's not a lot of variance in the units. There are quite a few that, at first glance, I can't really tell apart. Also there are LOT of hovertanks. I think they should have considered a little more variety.* UNITS ARE FAIRLY SYMMETRICAL : What I mean by this is... the aliens have regular soldiers, artillery, anti-vehicle, anti-infantry, bombers, fighters (etc), and so do the humans. The unit types between human and alien are virtually identical. While their base-building strategies are quite different, after the base is up, they're almost the same... with some variation for unique units and epic units. Its not like Starcraft where one species has great guns, the other has great armor and spells, and the other has enormous numbers. I do understand somewhat, why they cose not to do this though; because balancing asymmetrical RTS units is hard, and prone to exploitable failure. So its a minor disappointment, but an understandable one.---- IN CLOSING ----All of the plusses are big plusses for me, and all the minuses are minor. I highly recommend this game 9/10 , and I hope they DLC and sequel the hell out of it. Its very interesting, and I want more!  :)EDIT: Just finished the single player campaign (with all optional objectives) and its GREAT right up through the end. I did notice a few bugs towards the end... got 1 crash, Goo units tend to get stuck, and 1 trigger on final map wouldn't activate. Had to move over it like 20 times)			"

												First off, this is a quality game.  It is well made, great cinematics, high quality graphics (although the scenes a bit on the dark side) - yes worth the $49 release price IMO.I have now spent about 9 hrs playing and still working things out.  It is not complicated,  just an initiial learning curve of where and how to build structures, do upgrades, keep resources flowing etc.  There is ingame help but I found it to be  hints rather than a hand holding guide which I needed when i started playing.   There are 3 factions to learn to play- each quite different,  Like other RTS games the idea is to build up a base/bases and pump out fighting units and destroy the enemy.You only need to collect one type of resource.   You can have up to 200 units.Technically the game plays very smooth and well on the main, i have had the game crash once when I was right clicking madly.Is it fun?  Well yes,  I am enjoying the campaign I have played so far.   The campaign consists of 15 missions-5 for each of the 3 factions so plenty of opportunnity to learn all aspects of the game.The skirmish mode seems a bit limited as there are only 8 options of maps which include number of players each map.I have not played the MulitPlayyer as yet, due to none of my friends having this game, so cannot comment there.Nothing can beat my AoM/AoE games but  I did enjoy the slightly different style of game here and glad I bought it.If you enjoy space RTS games this is a nice one.  8/10 "

												Grey Goo is great concept, but suffers from bugs, crashes and lack of content.The best way to describe this game is ""incomplete"".There are only five missions per race in the single player campaign. The story is disjointed and not very well presented, despite beautiful cutscenes and decent mission briefings. At the end of the campaign, you find out this game, which is billed as a full game, is only a precursor to an actual storyline. The Emergence mini-campaign only adds three more missions (total; not per race) which take place during the regular game's campaign from a different perspective, giving no additional story. Unit types are mostly what you'd expect (light units, scouts, medium units, artillery, air and anti-air). Note the distinct lack of heavy units. Instead, you get epic units, which are extremely overpowered monstrosities. Putting aside the controversial epic units, the basic units are limited and poorly balanced. Artillery and aircraft, for instance, do very little damage. Artillery can hardly even dent walls and structures; medium units do a much better job. Medium units, while doing decent damage, can't take much, and so are easily destroyed by static defenses. Despite all this, the game manages to be pretty fun for a limited time. Until the bugs and crashes strike. For instance, on the final campaign mission, if you save at all during the mission, the win conditions are negated. No matter what you do, you can't win. The bug was acknowledged and had a supposed fix in a patch, but the latest patch still contains the bug. And while I had no crashes during the campaign, nearly half of the skirmish matches I have played have experienced game crashes. As for multiplayer, there are so few official maps available and the unofficial maps are mostly unbalanced, with none of them offering much more variety than amount and placement of resources, that it's really not worth playing for more than a few rounds. Overall, the incompleteness of the game makes it a disapointment.			"

												Grey Goo is the new Command & Conquer. Command & Conquer 5: Rise of the RTS.After Westwood Studios has been killed by ♥♥♥♥tard EA Games thing, C&C and RTS was dead too. In new RTS games that people played, they weren't fun at all. It was only competitive, made people want just to win (Excluding Starcraft).Now, If we talk about EA Games, well, ♥♥♥♥ EA Games. It doesn't even worth talking. I hate EA. It killed ALMOST ALL THE GOOD GAMES (Spore, Sims, SimCity...) and GOOD COMPANIES (Maxis, Westwood Studios, Popcap...). I always have heart attack when I think about it.Now lets get into the real review.First of all, this game is seriously unique with its gameplay and building system. I've never seen these kind of building construction style in other games. In a faction, buildings are connected to each other with some kind of cable thing. In another, buildings are pinched into hubs. Thats one of the unique things.Hud is awesome. It doesn't distract you or it doesn't makes the screen smaller like its in Dota 2.If we talk about missions... They are not that much new. If you've played old C&C games, don't expect that much. But still, it is fun. Building an army without needing Macro/Micro skills, having epic wars with your enemy, killing Goo. It will not make you bored.AI is also one of the good things. If you play with Easy AI, it is easy. Thats good for beginners. Also, hard is... hard! Graphics doesn't have much to say. Pretty suitable for this era of gaming.Music... Frank Klepacki... Please marry me.Well thanks for reading!NOW GO AND BUY THIS AWSOMENESS! "

												Grey Goo is a RTS throback to the good old days of Command and Conquer, before the Starcraft 2 juggernaut made RTS games APM twitchfests with only THE PRO WAY to play the game!!!!!!Petroglyph games, made up of former Westwood developers, has managed to find a way to make old fashioned RTS games fun again, along with attempting to shake up the standard RTS forumla along the way. First, this game's campaing is quite good for an RTS. 3 campaigns, each with five mission, lasting about 7.5 hours total make this game fun to play by yourself. The story is intersting to see unfold, and the cutscenese and voice acting are superb. The soundtrack is done by Frank Klepacki, who did the soundtrack for C&C games and Universe at War, another Petroglyph game. The three factions are the Beta, a race of 4 armed humanoids with walking tanks and conventional weapons, the Human, whose units are dominated by hovering drones with plasma guns, and the Goo, a ""race"" of Von Neuman machines who don't build bases, as thier ""base"" is a giant goo blob called a Mother Goo than can spawn factories on resource nodeds and can split once it harvests enough resources. Each faction plays differently than the others. The Beta can build base nodes anywhere, but base expansion is limited by the size of the node. Humans are locked to one base, but the base is expandable by power conduits, and the Goo simply use mobile Mother Goos as HQs.Second, this game comes equipped with an offline skirmish mode where you can practice against the AI.Third, Grey Goo's PvP online allows you to go 1v1 or 2v2, and allows for AI vs. Human matches.Ranked matches are matched via skill, whichhelps to avoid newbies getting constantly annahilated by more experinced players. No Replay mode ATM, but it is on the way.This game comes with a map editor, so the 8 maps that are included in the game are not the end.Overall, Grey Goo is well worth the asking price if you are any kind of RTS fan. If you are unsure, check out some Youtube videos and Steam reviews, as no demo is currently out.			"

												Wow, I think the metacritic reviews of this title were unduly harsh. This game deserves much higher than a 77. High 80s is more reasonable.Things to note:+The game is gorgeous. That's pretty damn rare in the RTS market.+Grey Goo implemented a race that turns traditional base-building strategy on its head and didn't break game balance.+It plays and feels like an old RTS, but updated and streamlined for the modern era of competitive gaming.+The multiplayer is freaking fun. Like seriously fun.+Grey Goo has added the ability to control every aspect of building/unit production via the Q,W,E,R keys. Making a Refinery is as easy as QQ and click where you want it. This frees you up for even more micro.-The campaign isn't very good. Petroglyph relied too heavily on artificial difficulty (poof! The enemy player suddenly has two epic units just because you broke down a certain section of wall!). They delighted in taking the glaring weakness of whatever race you are playing and make you do that thing over and over again. The turtle race doesn't get a level where they get to turtle. The ""I have no turrets"" race has to defend against endless tiny raids. Etc. And it's short with like 5-6 missions per faction.-Either this attracted some really skilled people, or all of the players have no life outside of Grey Goo. Seriously, I haven't won a matchmaking game yet.			"

												One of the best RTS in recent years. Each faction has its unique features and can provide unique experience. Combats are slower than SC2 and a good strategy is much more important than micromanagement. The optimization should be improved when there are a lot of units in the screen. Highly recommend to all RTS fans!PS: Teleporting buildings is awesome!			"

												It's refreshing to see an RTS that finally goes back to the genre's roots as well as adding interesting mechanics that feel right. The base building mechanics, units, and technologies for each race are completely unique but gameplay still feels balanced. As a huge fan of the classic C&C's, it's awesome that the soundtrack is composed by the man himself Frank Klepacki. Not only that but having former talent from Westwood working on this game, you really can't go wrong.			"

												I'm going to leave the recommendation at no for now, since it is difficult to come to a yes/no conclusion. If you can suffer through reading my review, the game has pros and cons that can be interpreted differently by different players.>Played during development stages, got to top 30 in 1v1 by playing goo.>Felt bad for playing an overpowered race (2 minute rage quit wins, or massive map expansion)>Took a break to see if they would adjust the races.>A big patch finally nerfs goo early game, commandos, and gladiuses (gladi?)>Goo is still OP (imho), can still end the game in very early stages, but beta have a chance at stopping them (not sure on humans b/c I don't play them much)The biggest problem I have- The resource areas deplete after a while (usually a long time at least), forcing expansion, but also expansion is very helpful in the game overall. Humans have never discovered how to counter the enigma of the sloped plane, so if there is a hill they can't expand out of their initial area. Beta have easy expansion, but they are vulnerable during it. These are well-balanced. However, the goo can expand easily without being vulnerable early game, and they can dominate the map. Unless the goo player has poor micro skills, it is rare that they lose.Overall, I'd recommend people to give the game a try while it is on sale, NOT for full price. The campaign is fun, and sometimes challenging. I'd also recommend to play with friends, rather than getting frustrated in ranked against different exploits.Pros:-great campaign, great cutscenes (haven't bought the dlc)-cool units, well designed, good graphics-units effectively counter each other (ex: AP versus tanks, tanks versus infantry)-satisfying wins (competitive)-high skill cap (heavy micro management)-A LOT like Universe at War (one of their older games, played it when I was younger)-good servers as far as I've seen-development team that tries to balance the game, listens to the community-despite my hate on goo, it does require some degree of micro skill-spamming one unit doesn't (usually) win the gameCons:-obnoxious exploits-goo is still a bit off-balance-somewhat repetitive-lacks any kind of memorable ""punch"" (does it's job but does not excel in it's genre)-very small active community-restricting unit cap (maybe just to me b/c I love massive battles) (200, epic units count as 60 if I remember correctly)-people like me who write massive reviews			"

												Overall it feels like a classic RTS from the 90's, early 2000's (C&C / RA / Dune). There are no special unit abilities which in my opinion adds more to the charm, each unit is strong and weak against another. The units themselve are very interesting in both design and how they move and for once we get to see the Humans as the more tech savvy fellows. The tech tree is simplistic, you get to choose 1 out of 3 upgrades for each type of unit (light, heavy, air, economy) and each upgrade caters to your overall playstyle. Base building and management is interesting and not hard to understand if you have played RTS games before (this apply's to the Human and Beta faction only). The campaign is lengthy, fully voiced and interesting to boot. The missions for each faction can be easy or hard, some are quite challenging taking up to 1 or 2 hours to beat and even some restarts. Some of them are trial and error and that's the charm of them. I was never angry with loosing a mission and having to restart again, I learned the AI's tactics each time I restarted and adapted. And of course, the soundtrack is amazing. But what else could you expect from Frank Klepacki. However, for those that love to play multiplayer in RTS, the game currently has a max of 4 players on maps (ie 4 FFA or 2v2). Some consider this a negative point for the game, some do not.Also, for those wondering about the name (why the game is called like this): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo "

												Grey Goo is the RTS I have been waiting for.

												This is a tricky game to review because, personally, I came to Grey Goo with high hopes but willing to forgive a lot just to have a new fun entry in my favourite genre that isn't Starcraft. I love RTS games and want to see more of them, so take that into account while reading this review.First, some technical problems. I'm running on a PC that was mid-ranged in 2012, and while the game itself mostly performs fine, the menu system has horrifically bad performance, stuttering at almost every opportunity. The in-game HUD is pretty large, and it's not always easy to tell what's going on at a glance since there's a lot of swapping similar panels out for one another. Unit pathfinding can get pretty bad, units push each other around (including into enemy fire!) and sometimes units seem downright unresponsive.The three different factions are quite interesting. I like the mobile, sneaky approach to the Goo's design, which goes against the swarms-of-units that you expect given the marketing; actual unit production with the Goo (you produce  sneaky, weak units that turn into more specialized units) is really innovative, but it's also tedious and difficult to manage, and easy to lose track of a Protean here or there. Playing against the Goo can become painful, though, because it's so hard to track down their ever-moving Mother Goos. The other two factions are fairly standard in RTS terms, though the Humans have a more lone-fortress approach to base building while the Beta are more about sprawling and forward expansions.In terms of moment-to-moment gameplay, I'd say that it's overall good solid fun, with a nice feel of ebb-and-flow once things really get going. A few caveats: units die extremely quickly and are completely disposable; area-of-effect attacks are, given how fragile units are, ludicrously effective; and the ""epic"" units are too slow and, yes, fragile to feel truly epic (though they do have massive AOE attacks that can wipe out dozens of units at a time, especially the insane Hand of Ruk). On the other hand, the brush cover mechanic that lets you hide units in forests is brilliant, and the developers aren't stingy with that cover either. Combine that with the Goo's mobility and the way that terrain height affects visibility, and you get an RTS where terrain actually matters significantly in combat, which is great.As for the campaign, I've just played through the entire thing, and it's a mixed bag. The developers saw fit to make the AI in the campaign extremely aggressive, even on ""normal""; by the third mission in, the AI was rushing my base with a dozen or more units 90 seconds into the game (a point at which it's almost impossible to have built more than a handful of units). In many cases it pays to avoid and skirt around mission objectives until you can amass a large force, since progresssing through objectives usually triggers even more aggressive AI behavior. There are other missions, though, where it's fairly easy to smash some key bases and wait around to build epics that will destroy everything else. Overall, the difficulty varies wildly, though at least the challenge gives you a sense of accomplishment.In terms of the story components, the cutscenes are gorgeous (best CGI faces I think I've ever seen in a video game), and the narrative itself is original and interesting, with some pertinent themes about science, exploration, and responsibility towards life. Unfortunately, the game itself doesn't let the story shine through; there are story elements mentioned in marketing materials or on official websites (or even on the Steam trading cards!) that never actually get dealt with in-game, which seems silly. Much of the narrative feels rushed, like they had more they wanted to say and do than they actually had the money/time to implement. The narrative has a solid core, but it needs some fleshing out to be truly great.Overall, I would say that Grey Goo is a promising, if flawed, RTS; a pretty good game, but not a great one. It's good enough that I hope they get to make a sequel, and that they get the opportunity to iron out the kinks from this initial offering. With a lot more attention to user-friendliness across the board, and a more fleshed-out and confident approach to the narrative, this game could really be something special.Ugh, given how rare new RTS games are as of 2015, I feel like I just said ""Pandas are pretty good mammals, but they're not great."" Seriously, folks, save the pandas.			"

												Grey Goo is, first and foremost, not Starcraft. If you like the modern Starcraft-esque RTS that's fast paced, micro intensive, and largely based on twitch skill and on-the-fly adaptation mixed with scouting and mastery of build order, this may not be the game for you. Grey Goo is slow, deliberate, and methodical. The organization of your forces going into an engagement is going to be much more important than what you do in the middle of the fight, and for most of the factions, all of your production is going to be very, very centralized, leading to longer games that focus on large-scale battles. Grey Goo as an RTS is far more focused on the large-scale strategy to the small-scale tactics, and it can be jarring for a lot of people if they're familiar with more micro-intensive games.The Good:- Large faction diversity. Basic units are present in each faction, but infrastructure needs vary drastically and while the same general roles are filled by each class and their units (Light tank, light damage, heavy tank, heavy damage, artillery, seige, scout, air, etc.), how each race goes about those basic goals has enough variety to make playing each faction quite different, especially the unorthodox Goo of the title.- Streamlined economy and tech management. Only the one resource to worry about, and tech, despite generally requiring certain buildings be built, isn't linked to them intrisically.- Excellent UI and menu design. Once you get used to it, the hotkeys for building are incredibly intuitive, allowing for easier base management without having to set your infrastructure to 4-5 hotkeys just by themselves.The Bad:- A very slow game. The standard win-condition requires you destroy the enemy core, all of their factories, and all of their refineries. Even if they literally could not possibly recover, you've gotta whittle away their buildings if they don't feel like surrendering. Which the AI doesn't so practicing against the AI is going to be a bit of a long process.- Buildings are very tanky and supply lines are difficult to disrupt early game, which makes harassment a non-viable option. Early-game can feel very same-y as you scout out the enemy and try and build your forces to counter theirs. The exception to this is the Goo, which...- The Goo, despite being really cool and unique, are incredibly weak one-on-one. They're the only faction vulnerable to harassment because their health is their resource, and because they gain resources so slow early on, it's very, very easy for them to fall into a death spiral, especially on small maps.Great Graphics, Great cutscenes, Fun Gameplay, Unique Factions. This game breathes new life into the RTS genre, introducing unique mechanics and strategies. That along with the pretyt solid story make me have no qualms recommending this to lovers of the genre.

												Real time strategy is my favorite genre, and I've played most of them over the past 25 years. While Grey Goo isn't going to make the top-10 of all-time, it is a wonderfully solid and smart game, and a very welcome addition to the greatest genre in gaming.What Grey Goo does better than most, from my perspective, is variation in faction/race type. One of them, anyway. There are three races, the Beta, the Humans, and the Goo. While the Humans and Beta are rather similar -- nicely done but somewhat generic military sci-fi type units -- the Goo are downright freaky! There are giant grey goobly globs called Mother Goo that slither and slime around the map like year old Jell-o, and from their (yuck) loins spring forth all manner of other oddball units, from thick-legged spiders with headlights, to giant, tank-like creatures that look like a cross between a sting ray and a rhino. Just weird, and thrilling. One of the most intriguing and original faction designs I can think of.The single player campaign consists of fifteen missions ranging from 45 minutes to an hour and a half a piece. And that's not counting retries, as this game is hard. Once you get the hang of a certain level you'll see a clear but challenging path to the end (hint: that clear path often involves building epic units), but until then, certain levels will leave you frustrated to tears as you throw all manner of units and strategies up against the proverbial wall and wonder what you're doing wrong.When I finished the game and finally overcame the the epic length and difficulty of the story campaign, it really did feel like an accomplishment. You know that feeling when you plug away at a tough game for a while, curses screamed and pets scared, and you feel wired up and full of energy? I was bouncing around my house for a good 10 minutes after finishing the last level; smiling, laughing, pumping my fist. That's the sign of a great game.			"

												EDIT: PLEASE NOTE: This review was an accurate reflection of the game experience when I wrote it - I do not plan to update the review since I wrote it regarding a game release for AAA pricing that failed on a number of levels. Many patches do exist, and technical and performance issues may have been resolved. I hope those were successful, but the integral weaknesses of the game's design cause it to be unsuccessful in providing a truly AAA RTS experience. The hotkey system is still brilliant however.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Grey Goo is an RTS offering from a studio many would consider one of the masters of the craft - Petroglyph. Responsible for the origins of franchises such as Command and Conquer (as well as a personal favourite of mine, Star Wars: Empire at War - though the quality of this particular entry could certainly be debated). Grey goo wanders in to the Sci-Fi realm of the asymmetrical RTS, making it directly comparable to the likes of Starcraft 2. A comparison which it would rather avoid given how poorly it ends up matching up. You can certainly make the argument that two races are indeed asymmetrical (the namesake grey goo offer a significantly different play style), the differentiation between the two humanoid species is - dubious at best. The superficial construction mechanics offer a little variety but the underlying units and strategies are not nearly as diverse as one might hope. The game does do a few things excellently however. The hotkey system is one that should be ripped off by any future RTS game developer. The design is elegant in its simplicity and intuitive in a way I would not have necessarily believed had I not experienced it myself. The game is slower paced than contemporary RTS - Starcraft 2 - requiring less micro control from the gamer and a more efficient and considered macro game. You learn quickly that economy is king, and you will - even when facing easier AI competition - find yourself overwhelmed if you don't nail down some early game builds. This leads to some concern over the balance of different strategies in the multiplayer version of the game. The campaign is perfectly serviceable if unspectacular. The missions are diverse, and the game itself looks quite beautiful - but that beauty comes at a cost. The performance issues of this game are the major hampering factor to truly enjoying the experience. This machine is no slouch and the ""real time"" rendering is pretty atrociously laggy. The game also slows, stutters and downright chokes once a certain number of units are on the field. It's worth noting that I did not see any of that in the mission maps, only multiplayer. The menus cruise along at an impressive *cough* 12-15 FPS. The system shows no sign of strain (GPU temps remain a cool 48 degrees for example). So, all this said, is this a recommend or not? Sadly, for the cost, it's hard to justify the expense. I suspect the player base will make multiplayer a relatively modest affair, but once the cost gets low enough, it's certainly a very enjoyable campaign and the grey goo are a joy to play with should you desire to skirmish a little. So, it is with sadness that I do NOT recommend this game outside of a nice aggressively priced sale. I was hoping to find a new RTS in to which I could sink dozens if not hundreds of hours. This game ended up falling short - but in the long run, I don't believe I will regret having it in my library, only that I paid so much to get it there.			"

												Got this game from: https://www.bundlestars.com/en/bundle/indie-legends-5-bundle And yes it's a definitive copy, so you'll get all perks for mere few bucks. It has extra campaign, and of course the great soundtracks. At this rate, it's a steal.When I fired up the game for the first time, it instantly reminded me of Starcraft 2 and even more with GG's futuristic template, let alone same genre.Graphically it's neat, have many in-game options for like Shader, Geometry and the regular Vsync. CG is nice, only one notch less than Blizzard's in my eyes. And I can play with 60 fps flat on my mediocre laptop. The problem is the Multiplayer. The game, despite it's a decent MP game, community's dead. You may need to arrange match with other people before you jump into MP. But no worry, the single player aspect is already more than enough content. I'm enjoying playing the campaigns so far.Recommended.			"

												I've never heard of this game before and what actually sold the game to me is the epic trailer and the game coverage done by TotalBiscuit.I loved the old C&C games and this game just makes me feel right at home with the classic RTS genre. But the game offers more than that.EPIC dynamic music just makes the battles that much epic.Interesting and epic storyline and races.Slightly interesting units, most of em are just generic units that serves different purposes.Currently theres only 4 player skirmish and multiplayer, probably due to the game currently is in their Gold release. There are also performances issues that happens after a while of playing, especially if theres a lot of units on your screen. Also there are some graphic options missing like turning off the shadows and AA (I'm pretty sure it's turned on by default) and that slows down the game for many players that are using a mid-powered system to run it on. Here's to hoping that the game would be patched soon!Classic RTS lovers, this one is a sure buy.			"

												(Review update) - Almost a year after this game has been released the balance of the game is still in a bad shape, maps for competitive 1vs1 arent balanced at all, and the factions are as unbalanced as they were in release date, it almost made me update this review and not recommend the game but i still think it can get better.If this game had faster updates and better developer communication with the community it could have been one of the best RTS`s out there.Multiplayer: After playing 334 hours and ranking high on the 1v1 leaderboard im totally jaded with this game. Its not a game you should buy hoping for a lasting multiplayer experience, at least not with what the game offers currently.Single player: The campaign itself is decent with cool cutscenes and a nice lore surrounding the factions, however i wouldnt recommend you buying this game solely on the single player experience, as the campaign itself is not long enough or that interesting compared to the price your paying.Final opinion; So why do i recommend this game, its a decent game with a cool art and functional gameplay that has the potencial to get better if the developers put their dedication back into the game. But as things stands the game is sort of in limbo waiting for the developers get their act together. I will still recommend it because it has potential that`s the main thing to look for in this game.So buy it if you wanna support the developers or just want to play a short singleplayer campaign if you are bored.Dont buy it if you want a solid and competitive multiplayer experience.

Posted: February 5, 2015
												Grey Goo is a new offering from Petroglyph, a company with an impressive RTS pedigree (its members were involved with classics such as Dune II, Command & Conquer, Universe at War and others). Its premise is a return to the traditional RTS design philosophy, discarding new trends (many of them result of the search for e-sport status) such as weak defenses, ultra-fast pace, death-balls, and micro-intensiveness, trends that reward fast twitch reflexes and perfect build orders instead of strategic acumen.I believe they have succeeded: if you are tired of these trends (and you can bet I am - Starcraft II was a huge disappointment for me) and fondly recall old RTS games with epic, long yet relaxed matches over LAN, you'll probably find something to love in Grey Goo. As it somehow always happens to me with Westwood Games, it took me a bit of time to get used to the game flow and interface (boy I sucked at the beginning), but once I did I had a blast.Furthermore, Grey Goo offers an appealing setting, supported by rock-solid audiovisual design (Weta Workshop had part in conceptual design, for starters). For me, this is one of its greatest strengths. The game offers a more proper ""science fiction"" background than your typical PC-game fare (more given to the ""science fantasy"" genre), with a nice touch of wackiness. I enjoyed it for its interesting concepts (microscopic wormhole travel via nanotech, Von Neumann probes gone awry, an original but not quite apocalyptic ""grey goo"" scenario, humans that are more technologically advanced, aloof and ""alien"" than the aliens proper, etc.), for its general ""vibe"" (an grounded yet optimistic outlook reminiscent of 70s space fantasy, instead of the typical cynical and nihilistic take of most games), and for its honest story (featuring relatable characters that don't randomly act like psychopaths for artificial dramatic effect).The other key strength of the game is the ""Goo"" faction itself. While Humans and Beta (the other playable factions) have different mechanics as typical in modern RTS, this creepy faction offers a truly unique experience. For starters, they have no buildings - as Goo, you have mother masses of formless goo moving around the map eating resources, and growing to perform mitosis. The formless goo masses that result can be used as units in their own right, or morph into specific forms that fulfill a more specialized role. It sounds very strange, but once experienced it becomes second nature and a nice respite from the usual RTS gameflow.Those were the highlights for me - but for an important general outlook of the game, I'll use a pros vs. cons list:Pros:- Three different and interesting factions, including the titular, creepy and original Grey Goo.- Rock-solid gameplay with traditional design of the Westwood school. - Excellent graphics and visual design.- Excellent sound design (background sounds, voice acting, unit sounds and ambiance are all very well done).- Superb soundtrack courtesy of Frank Klepacki himself (author of dozens of classic game soundtracks - maybe you know him from Red Alert, Emperor: Battle for Dune, Universe at War or others - if not, you should!).- An interesting science fiction setting that makes you like the factions.- A solid campaign with good difficulty, an interesting story, and a lot of well directed, top-notch cutscenes (from now on I'll keep track of their maker, Axis Animation).- A terrain editor ships with the game.Cons:- The campaign, while satisfying, is a bit short and its mission design could have been more varied (for me Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, an otherwise forgettable game, is the gold-standard in this regard).- The Skirmish and Multiplayer modes are fun but bare bones - it would be nice to have more options, game types and maps to play around.- Some users report lower FPS than expected. I cannot verify nor comment since my 8 year old, technically unsupported PC logically struggles with the game but still manages to have a pretty  playable experience (which I'm pretty happy about).To close, I loved the game as it hit a lot of right stylistic and game design notes for me, so I admit I'm an enthusiastic and biased (who isn't) reviewer. Nevertheless, I would sincerely recommend it for any RTS fans that enjoy the aforementioned design philosophy or had their interest piqued by the setting.			"

												AN INSTANT CLASSIC!Grey Goo draws much inspiration from the classics of the genre, such as C&C and Age of Empire, but still manages to feel fresh and current. The environment is extremely beautiful, complex and detailed (think Avatar crossed with Crysis 2), whilst the mechanics are smooth and simple. The developers have avoided the all to common urge of completely over-complicating the interface, tech-tree and economy and have chosen to focus on enjoyment, playability and tactical battles. After only an hour of play I am hooked. ""The king of RTS is dead... Long live the King!"" "

												Terrific return to the classic RTS formula prevalent before the age of SC2.  + Engaging and challenging campaign with 15 missions that lets you play through all 3 races.+ Amazing cinematics on-par with the best from Blizzard+ Ranked 2v2 / 1v1 multiplayer ladder+ LAN support+ Terrific music, seriously well done+ 3 Unique factions with benefits and drawbacks+ Focused on macro gameplay instead of having each unit with some activatable ability+ Map builder support (and developer support of the fan made maps!)- Glitchy.  Frame drops and disconnects are a little too common.  Developers are aware and patching.- Balance:  Between the map pool and a couple overpowered combinations the game does have balancing issues.  Teleport is way too powerful and some maps make playing the goo nearly an auto win.Overall, I really enjoy playing the game and look forward to future patches & expansions!  Worth the money			"

												Made by the developers of the original Command & Conquer (ex-Westwood Studios employees) which was the first game that introduced me to the PC Master Race. Combined with another amazing Soundtrack to boot thanks to the man himself Frank Klepacki and gameplay feel like classic Command & Conquer (build and attack) with less babysitting (ie. micromanage). For a RTS deprived fan that just want to throw my troops and not worry about special abilities to maintain in the field and $20 on summer sale this is a no brainer.Also for people confuse why they titled it Grey Goo. here's to enlighten some of you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo hope i didn't spoil anything ;)			"

												Grey Goo is a real-time strategy set in an allien world where 4 different races fight in fierce battles against each other over energy source called Catalyst. This may seem to you as a classic RTS style, but don't get too overwhelmed even though the game is pretty enjoyable at least it has its moments there are many new features influencing the game in both good and bad directions. I have summarized the key points of the game below.Pros+ 4 entirely different unique races+ Great and interesting main story+ High quality graphics and astonishing cutscenes+ More difficulties and playstyles of AI+ Easy to learn, hard to masterCons- Unbalanced - Main story is way too short- Population cap locked on 200- Max skirmish/mp players set on 4- Speed is locked and sometimes it feels to be dragging- Epic units are overpowered (beyond acceptable level)The game as a whole feels too incomplete notwithstanding the game is titled as ""Definitive Edition"". I loved all C&C and this reminds me of it a lot, but I see skirmish as a main feature of all RTS and that is where Grey goo disappointed. Still there is enough to make the game catchy and entertraining for a while. 6.5 /10 "

												This is by far one of the best RTS games I've played since SC2 released. The developer brought back a lot of the finesse and strategy that the old C&C games had, and brought that into the modern day with a lot of cool QoL changes, and gameplay features. I have memorable moments just by going against the AI that I simply couldn't have in other games. Not to mention, the soundtrack in this game is phenomenal.Pros:-Graphics; a solid 9/10-Audio; from unit sounds to soundtrack the audio is amazing.-Controls; similar to League, but the default hotkeys make things super quick and simple to build from afar.-Presentation; the SP is well presented, the story interesting, and pacing is well done. Not to mention BEAUTIFUL CGI.-Ships with a map editor!Cons:-Slight balance issues.-Needs more tutorials in my opinion.-FPS issues on 2v2 maps occasionally.-No replays, or commentator functions in multiplayer.

												This is an amazing game. One of the best new RTS games to come out since the Dawn of War series. Incredibly well made; the production values are top-notch. The voice acting, the graphics, the models, and the sound are all incredibly well done. The writing is very solid - telling a familiar sci-fi cautionary tale with an excellent twist.The gameplay is smooth and well thought out. The only complaint I can recall is that the mini-map isn't as full-featured as I expect from a modern RTS. You can't seem to (or at least, I never could) click on the mimi-map to instantly move your camera to that location. But these misses were minor, few, and far between.By far my favorite part of the game was the titular faction. The Grey Goo is the most innovative RTS concept I've ever seen. I dare say that they perform the ""Zerg motif"" better than the Zerg do - and before you declare me a blasphemer, let me explain. Part of the Zerg flavor was always that they arrive at a planet. murder a bunch of living things, and then use that biomass to increase their own numbers. Sort of like a sci-fi version of a necromancer: your fallen enemies increase your strength.And that was awesome. But that flavor rarely found its way into the mechanics, really. Sure, you could infest a Terran HQ to produce an infested marine. But that was it. For the vast majority of the time, you harvested crystals and vespene, just like everyone else. And you spawned units out of buildings (albeit gooey buildings) just like everyone else. Not a lot of the ""murdering for biomass"" flavor in there.But the Grey Goo take that concept to its logical conclusion in the mechanics. You have only one production ""building"" - the mother goo. It can roam around looking for suitable mass to absorb, but it is also a dangerous unit in its own right. It can traverse any terrain, and it can occupy the same space as enemy units and buildings, damaging them and healing itself while it does so. And its health is the only resource the goo needs. It spends goo (its health) to spawn specialized constructions. Mechanisms made from goo that perform specialized tasks (like murdering things from far away). Then, once the murdering is done, the enemy becomes goo and heals the mother goo. It's a perfect implementation of the ""murdering for mass"" flavor that the Zerg made us fall in love with.But the Grey Goo is just one part of this game that makes it so excellent.All in all, a highly recommended game.

												10/10 This game is by far THE most immersive game that I own, or am ever likely to own, on Steam. The graphics are absolutely beautiful and cinematic cut-scenes between each mission tell a rich and inspiring story.  The soundtrack behind it all is immense and powerful, although don't be tempted to buy it seperately as additional content because apparently you don't get all the tracks which are in the game - of which there are many, believe me!In terms of replayability, I have played the campaign about 5 times over now, and multiplayer can give you endless amount of time to practice and hone your skills. I would imagine that the game could be somewhat limited in multiplayer though, as is the case when you play any RTS into the ground. If you like strategy games and really want a game with content for a change, then buy this game in the next sale. It's simply incredible and the community is also really fun to be a part of :D			"

												Grey Goo:~~~~~~~~  On board the LSV Darwin, which is on an orbital trajectory around the planet Ecosystem 9, Lucy Tak is eagerly waiting for the analysis on specimens taken on the surface of the planet. The specialist who took the specimens was attacked by a strange life form and all contact was lost. After talking to Singleton, a human android who is on the surface of the planet, she decides to recall all the remaining surface teams to the LSV Darwin. Mum, the on board main computer (does that sound familiar to all of us) informs Lucy that the specimens reveal two forms of life on the planet, when suddenly MUM suffered a malfunction (what bliss)! Something shook the spaceship and Lucy has only one option…. to enforce a general evacuation and launch all pods toward the planet. At the same time down below, a civilization under the name of Beta is having an un-expected issue with the keyhole due to a minor data burst. At the same time pods coming down through the keyhole! Is it the silent one coming at them? Is it the time to form an alliance between two species? Goo will tell!!Grey Goo is a real time strategy game set on a planet called Ecosystem 9. You will be playing the BETA faction first then the Human on the campaign mode. This is a fabulous game made by the original author (developers) of Command and Conquer which is the game that got me hooked on this genre!Whatever factions you are playing, you will have to generate energy by building refineries on catalyst sites. As you collect energy, you will be able to build structures, the likes of factories, silos and factory attachments (artillery, tank, stealth).  Upon this you will be able to build different types of units as well as defences to beat each level. What makes Grey Goo such a special game is the combination of gameplay, graphics and splendid audio passing with absolutely stunning cut scenes.I rest my case.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Great graphics & audio-	Stunning cut scenes-	Entertaining story-	3 factions to play with-	Single and multiplayer modes-	Trading cards-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~  -	Umm…NONE!If you are a real RTS fan, you must have this game in your game library!10/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Rating 8.5/10Overview: Real Time StrategyThe Good:+4 very different factions, 3 for single player and an extra faction for multiplayer. Each faction presents its own unique units, structures, build order, perks.  + Lots of graphical options+The AI is very competent, with different difficulty options to adjust the behavior.  +The game strikes a great balance between macro and micro management. For those looking to get into a RTS game this is a good place to start. Unlike other RTS games of this nature the focus is more about building the right type of units as opposed to managing your economy/units. If you ever played StarCraft or Warcraft you may find this game a bit easier as you don’t have to micro manage too much. +Single player campaign has a variety of different mission with some unique ideas. Not every mission is about destroying the enemy bases. +Skirmish mode allows you play against AI’s in a variety of different maps. The Average:The story and characters is where the game is a lacking. Despite the great CGI scenes, the characters are not really interesting and the story doesn’t provide any new ideas. Despite this, the story does maintain a cohesion throughout the game. The Bad:- Takes a long time to save and load- Grey Goo…really…. that’s the best name you came up with for a game? Nobody in the company said this sound terrible? - Multiplayer is dead which is really sad because this is a really great RTS game. Conclusion: Probably the closest thing to StarCraft you are going to see on Steam. It has a ton of interesting ideas, combines different RTS elements in one package and feels very polished. RTS genre fans should be playing this game.  "

												Grey Goo is a well rounded old style RTS with a macro focus, not as macro focused as Supreme Commander but something more alike to Westwood's original RTS concepts with Dune and C&C. It's only logical since Petroglyph is a studio formed from what was left of Westwood after the EA debacle years ago. The game's reasonably well balanced with no major complaints or at least an equal amount of complaints about every faction being op and there's an active online community right now. The micromanagement heavy style that you see in high level SC2 games doesn't seem possible since units have no active abilities, the game is also a tad slower than most modern RTS players(if there's any left) would be used to. It makes up for that with great faction design, it reminds me a bit of Universe at War in that field since they all play pretty differently. Humans and Beta are a bit more alike with relatively standard base building that differs greatly in execution and building but the Goo is as different as the Hierarchy was in UaW. The Goo has mobile bases that replicate themselves into other ""bases"" or smaller clumps of goo that turn into units and it's surely one of the more interesting factions in RTS in a long time, also the owner of the silliest name.Overall I recommend this game very much so, it's like the return of Westwood, hopefully it'll do well enough that they can keep doing their thing in the years to come. As an addendum there's the AWESOME soundtrack by Frank Klepacki himself, the man still makes incredible music and it shall not disappoint both fans and new listeners.			"

Initial impressions (1/23/15)The game is fantastic, once you get settled in, figure out the controls (Hits close to C&C) you will enjoy the game. The tech/build structure is great, seems/feels like almost everything is physical, from tank building capabilities to air supplements. However since this is a new game, it doesn't come with a few bugs and quirks, but it's not bothersome. If you like RTS with from what I assume is a great story, then this game definitely delivers.In-depth analysisComing soonConclusionComing soonPoints and features The game layout is very independent, it does not rely on a single upgrade that will unlock every feature in every structure. The graphics are superb, however this being a new game, I believe that the performance can be improved. The game is definitely worth the money. If you're a huge C&C fan you should definitely at least try this game. Has a compelling plot. Tutorial is a bit steep, however if you're a former RTS player of Starcraft or C&C then you should be familiar with the key layouts. Price seems fair. Soundtrack is great.Tl;dr this game is great			"

Luckily the game is quite playable, especially the singleplayer.Many features are missing due to the developers running out of time, but are confirmed, such as replay/observer support, so don't fret if they aren't in right now!The gameplay is a throwback to CnC; plays very much like Red Alert but keeps the formula fresh and has reinvented the concepts of base building and map control to something completely original!The game seems pretty decently balanced for a first attempt.

												Overall: This is a solid RTS.  If they keep releasing content, it'll be an instant classic.Mechanics:Walls have made a return and with them come units that receive defensive bonuses for mounting them. The cutscenes and music are great. The unit trees are great and the tech attachments include upgrades for units you might not expect. Resources are acquired via refineries, extractors (1:1) and pools. There's an optimal spot to place the extractors on the pools where you get +25% minerals per second, but if there's no other pools close by you may want to forego that bonus in favor of building two refineries and offsetting two extractors on a single pool.Difficulty: I've had to walk away from some missions on the campaign and reapproach with a different strategy with the difficulty just set to 'Normal'. To echo what another reviewer said, it seems the AI will scout you and if you don't have at least two factories cranking out units from the time you establish your first refinery, they're going to hit you with everything they've got.Video:What you see is what you get. It's a great looking game.Audio:I don't keep up with who composed which game, etc. I'm usually the guy who gets annoyed by the background music and turns it off so I can hear other things while I'm playing the game. Not so with Grey Goo. Really well done.			"

												If you enjoy SC2 ladder play, and are looking for something new, I highly recommend this game. Given the small developer, it's amazingly close to Starcraft2 level quality. Visuals are awesome once you get contrast/gamma tuned up. Multiplayer ladder is very engaging. Cheese exists, as do cheese counters. As a novice, gameplay seems a bit slower and more positionally strategic compared to SC2, though there is certainly room for micro APM to make a huge difference. There are a few ""first release"" bugs, but pretty minimal and as-expected. Windowed-Fullscreen works well. Steam shift-Tab chat stuff is a little clunky compared to SC2/battle.net, but that's half because of steam.			"

In short this game is well polished and a more slow paced RTS like those seen in the 90's.  Petroglpyh have once again delivered a stunning RTS during a time where MOBA's have taken over.  I'm happy to finally see a game which hasn't been dumbed down to secure a console release and it is a true PC game through and through.			"

												Grey Goo is a blander, kind of budget Starcraft. It has innovative base building and unit mechanics between it's three (initial) very diverse factions and much of the polish, too, with great CGI cinematics and a a raft of relatively 'hard' (i.e. plausible) sci-fi pretensions. But gameplay just lacks excitement somehow.It has novelty, but in the context of obvious derivative echos: the aliens are junky, lower tech (like the Terrans), with South African sounding accents and are more sympathetic that the human faction, with a colder, clinical aesthetic, touting smoothly curved hovering units (echoing the Protos). Their structures need unbroken adjacent conduit connection to the core base building to operate, which is interestingly different.The titular Goo would be the obvious Zerg swarm stand in. They're unique in having no base structures to build, all splitting off bigger mother blobs that harvest resources directly.But as a core concept they're emblematic of the game's lack of pizazz. Fundamentally problematic to work with artistically: typically, the 'grey goo' concept involves out-of-control nano-bots that consume all matter around them, reducing entire planets to a mush of their replicas. Nightmarish and unstoppable. But of course, to fit the RTS genre there needs to be units of some kind to click on and control. So the game goes half way and has undulating grey pancake things and specialised bug-eyed offspring for most offense unit that look kind of arbitrary and ridiculous. It all feels a little too naff, that they can't munch on trees and scenery, or even enemy units all the much, since the game has to be somewhat balanced and playable.The story ark was ok, but predictable and uninspiring for me as a hard sci-fi aficionado. They make use of a fair bit of real world terminology (e.g. Von Neumann probes, etc), as well as genre tropes, which is cool to get it out there, but kind of trite.I can't comment on multi-player, which I didn't really try, with no friends owning the game to play with and little enthusiasm after the single player.By the time I'd completed the main campaign and Emergence DLC I was just glad I'd made it to the end! I struggled a lot with the final missions, not really in a fun way. Although they were presumably meant to crescendo, I had to check out multiple YouTube videos, use save games prodigiously and really take a lot of time sitting around to make sure my Goo forces were built up to max strength before attacking, etc.Overall, if you're an RTS fan then you could do worst than grabbing this while it's on sale. Far more artistic value than Ashes of the Singularity, for example, and slightly better money's worth, with an extra DLC mission and forth faction added on for free earlier this year. So, check it out, why not. :-)			"

												It's about time another good RTS came out.  Obviously, there will be endless comparisons with other big franchises such as Starcraft and Command and Conquer.  While it does share some qualities with the previously mentioned games, Grey Goo successfully presents its own fresh take on the genre while still staying close to the roots of classic RTS games.  The Goo faction is what probably catches most people's eyes.  They are a unique faction which relies on taking over the map with self replicating nanobots.  They are unique in that they technically don't have base, and all of the units are produced by breaking off ""Proteans"" from the ""Mother Goo.""  These Proteans can be morphed instantly into whatever unit you feel is suited for a given moment.  The Goo faction plays very reactionary, and requires a lot of multi-tasking during the late game.  The other two factions are slightly more traditional.  They are the Humans and the Betas.  The Humans are very good at playing defensively.  Often, it is very difficult to break into their main base due to the wide array of defenses and powerful units they have.  Betas, on the other hand, have weaker yet more mobile units which encourages aggressive play that rewards good micro skills.This game is slower paced than a game such as Starcraft, but that does not take away from the skill required to play the game.  Micromanaging your forces is important as fights generally last longer than they would, again, in Starcraft.  Having a high APM (Actions Per Minute) is useful, but does not present as many benefits as it would in other games.Mechanics aside, the game also features modest-sized campaign.  There are five missions for each faction (15 total).  The campaign is garnished with very impressive cutscenes, and a killer soundtrack.  The story is alright, but the gameplay was fun enough to supplement the mulitplayer.  I would not recommend the game if you were just going to play the campaign and then drop it.Overall, the game is very fun.  In an industry dominated by MOBAs and FPS, Grey Goo has satisfied an itch which has been long overdue.  I highly recommend this game if you are into competitive matchmaking, and hope the game grows to have a modest playerbase.  Pros:+Stylish graphics+Great Soundtrack+Decent campaign+Fun, unique factions+Competitive multiplayerCons:-Lack of replays (Devs say it will come shortly after launch)-Menu lag-Somewhat lack of diversity in distinguishing Goo units-AI could be better-Maps could be bigger and allow for more than 4 players at once			"

												TLDR: It's a generic RTS, kinda shallow and overly complicated where it shouldn't be but can be enjoyable. If it's cheap, you can have some fun with it. If it's not on sale, I do not advise spending that much on it.On to the detailed part...Graphics, design:The engine is decent, the visuals are nothing astonishingly beautiful but the are fine.The world itself is pretty washed out, for me, every map felt the same and that gets old, pretty damn fast.The units and buildings were... I don't remember. They are damn forgettable. There are some weird design choices that just end up being ugly (like human giant robot that looks like it's about to topple over all the time).Audio:Good music. End of this part.Seriously speaking, voice lines and sound effects are so generic that you wouldn't even notice if they weren't there. They did a rather good job with lipsyncing and facial gestures during cinematics, it feels wasted.Gameplay - combat, units:I personally like RTS games, especially the CnC series. Sadly EA went overboard with the unit abilities and counters (guess they tried to ride the MOBA wave, but didn't expect that things that worked there might not work in an RTS) so I really looked forward to this game. Thankfully the unit abilities and counters are not really a problem here. On the other hand, unit management and combat feels a damn lot like Planetary Annihilation, Supreme Commander, Total Annihilation etc. just on a much smaller scale. Basically units are soulless little models walking up and down on the screen by the dozens. Nothing like the trigger happy NOD rocket soldiers, or the bushido-style Protoss zealots etc. You see tons of them during a match but barely ever stop to think something so basic as ""ah, that unit is an XYZ"" as you just don't really care. You just make green dots and send them to combat the red dots on the radar. Gameplay - economy, building:This is the part they tried to be original in and made base building unique for the faction, but overall they ended up botching it, possibly damning the whole game in the meantime. This part really does feel complex but feels complex for the sake of being complex. Meaning there is no reason for it, especially considering how shallow the combat is. Everything requires something first. To build a single flying combat unit (that can attack) for the BETA faction, you need a hub or a headquarters to build onto (buildings are powered by these), a hangar, an air-tech building and a factory. Yippie. In CnC you needed an airfield and I guess a reactor building to power it.What I want to convey is that instead of being deep, it's overcomplicated, instead of providing decisions it kills most tactics outright, turning the pace into a crawl sometimes. Make no mistake, I don't like the current trend of rush tactics at the first 2 minutes of a PvP match but this really does feel like they just wanted to slow stuff down without any real reason beyond that.

												Solid RTS title.Gameplay is reminiscent of old-styled games in the genre in a very good way. Faction balance is good in general, and their gameplay is asymmetric. Macroing tends to be the main focus; you set many factories to build on repeat. Single main resource. Base-building style varies between the factions.Single-player campaign (with bundled DLC campaign) took me around 16 hours while completing secondaries. A few missions were frustratingly hard (on hard difficulty), but by no means unbeatable after a restart or two after I knew what to expect. It's worth it, especially if it goes on sale. Great cinematics and soundtrack, story is alright with a few missteps in pacing.Multiplayer lacks the community to keep it afloat, sadly, so I would recommend you base your purchase on the single-player aspect.

												The Shroud, when domination is on your mind. I love this game. The CGI in the campaign is literally un-matched and has a fantastic short story. A very entertaining RTS that gives you 4 unique factions that play quite differently from one another. I am glad to see the developers are active and keeping the user experience at the highest level.[CAMPAIGN]The story is golden and gives you adequate information on each faction -Shroud, To provide you with confidence when playing the factions in skirmish. Unfortunately the campaign is not very long and leaves me wanting more! This is not exactly bad news simply because it is amazing, just that it leaves you with a desire for more. I recommend everyone that owns this game play the entire Campaign.[SKIRMISH]//Beta -  Ironically, The Beta are a Human-like alien race with lesser technology and primitive weapons when compared to the other factions. (ie. [Ballistics; missiles, rockets, bullets, cannons]  Heavy armor, rugged metal designs, simple looking structures.) Nonetheless an extremely fun faction to play as. The Epic is a great utility on the battlefield and can easily sway the odds in your favor. Simple expansion, good variety of units with good stats. Beta IMO are the easiest to play as with their layout of bases, which can be placed anywhere you have vision and space to do so. Overall Beta provides you with a great variety of units and structures to give you a high winning % with a low learning curve!//Humans - Sci Fi-like units and tech, Drones are the primary make-up of vehicles. Teleportation gives you the ability to teleport units to a certain ""visible"" location. Also, teleporting structures across the conduits gives flexibility and many strategic options. Units deal decent damage and the Epic is all-around quite powerful and can quickly shut down the opposition when played correctly. HQ is the central point of your expansion in which you can only extend so far with, sadly. Great defensive capabilities but expanding is rather difficult. Overall Humans give you a slightly harder yet satisfying experience. The diversity of the Humans makes them deadly when you learn the curve.//Goo -  A complex algorithm which evolved into a deadly consolidation of nanites that are extremely adaptive. Unlike the other 3 factions the Goo do not have a set HQ, instead an exceptionally mobile ""Mother Goo"" in which can split itself (Meiosis) into smaller proteins in which form units. The Mother Goo is also able to countlessly split and form into additional Mother Goo's that give you easy expansion over the entire map. The Goo are easy to play but hard to master. Goo are primarily illusive and are extremely hard to pin down which give them versatility. The unit make-up is interesting and can leave you favoring only a few for mulit role functions. No air units! Damage and health are not quite as good as the Human and Beta faction, Instead utilize quantity of quality. Having only the need for ""Spigots"" (appear as steam from resource pools) the Goo can indefinately produce units and over time wean down the other factions when they become resource drained. The Goo are dangerous when using ""Zerg-like"" tactics to overwhelm the enemy. The Epic can be had quickly and is deadly in more than one way, able to heal Mother Goo and consume targets (not for health) as well as pulverize from a distance. Overall The Goo are IMO the most fun yet challenging of the 4 factions which require a decent amount of awareness.//Shroud ""Silent Ones"" - Ancient race that coincidentally resemble the Protoss from Starcraft and are equally as powerful! The Shroud is the newest playable faction and shake up the roster a great deal. Able to evolve, overcharge, mimic etc.. The Shroud can easily overcome an opposition's tactics. Unique characteristics for their units which can give them high damage and armor if upgraded properly. The base units can seem a bit underpowered early game. The Shroud has amplifiers which obviously amplify and can evolve into spikes which give you great adaptivity. Unfortunately you can not go back once evolving amplifiers. While not able to set base anywhere from the start like the Beta, The Shroud can however expand when placing structures and exctractors down to provide a larger radius in which to place structures. The Shroud has the most devastating air units IMO and can easily change the tides of a battle especially against the Goo. The Epic is by far the strongest of the 4 factions and as a result needs to be evolved to stage 3 which can take a great deal of time after building. Overall The Shroud are not easy to learn but once understood IMO are the strongest of the 4. (My favorite race) I know it was not a long review but it is worth describing how great of a game Grey Goo is. I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys RTS of any form. The gameplay is entertaining, the graphics are tasty, the audio is crisp, and the CGI is un-matched.P.S. The Shroud aka Silent One's Epic, The Dirge at Stage 3 drops black holes.Would Black Hole an entire race into extinction again 10/ Divide by 0			"

												I'd call this game a ""quick"" RTS - one where the matches are over pretty quickly and instead of spending a lot of time on base building, expansion, and resource gathering prior to all out war, it's one where you're generally going to build up and engage pretty quickly with the intent of obliterating your opponent.  In this regard, it's on par with other similar games like Planetary Annihilation.  What sets this game apart, and makes it superior, is the goo itself as a faction.  It has a delightfully simple but well-designed, well-balanced, and just fun to play mechanic.  The Humans and Beta are your typical Quick style RTS fare, and play about the same as most other RTS games you've played.  The Shroud has its own set of interesting, fun mechanics as well, but imho, the goo is just awesome and fun.   "

												It feels good. Very slow-paced, in a good way, with a focus on managing your economy in order to be as efficient as possible. The end-game has a tendency to be a bit deathball-y, but that's fine, because that's what you want in this sort of game. Visuals are very nice, the cutscenes in particular. The three factions all have a distinct personality, and the different take on Aliens/Humans in a sci-fi setting is refreshing. Audio production is top-notch, with great voice acting and sound effects, with a particular shout-out to Klepacki's music. This game sounds GREAT.Overall, it's a tonne of fun from what I've played so far. Absolutely recommended to fans of Command and Conquer, or RTS in general during its peak of popularity.			"

												A must have for anyone that fell in love with RTSs through the C&C and RA, and can be well enjoyed by fans of the AoE series. This game brings back the fast paced base building and army building, all while avoiding the need for extensive micro. Victory rest on staying on top of your economy's development and maintaining a well balanced army that makes extensive use of complementary units types, since success revolves around making full use of unit hard counters. If you think you can get away with simply using a massive army of cheap units of the same type agaisnt Hard AI or decent human players, then you're sadly mistaken. "

												I bought the game because reviewers said it reminded them of old-school RTS games, such as Warcraft II and Command & Conquer (games I grew up with and adore). However, I was extremely disappointed with the poor level design in the game's campaign mode.The most fun levels aren't interesting or innovative - they merely allow you to explore your units' and structures' various abilities and tactics. Half of the levels have a time limit of some type for some objective that you have to find and protect (rule of thumb for almost any game in any genre - protection missions SUCK by default and need some serious effort put into them to make them fun for players). For me, half the fun of a campaign level in an RTS is getting access to new units to control and to revise your tactics to incorporate them against an enemy (which might also get new units that you need to counter).Also, every single unit in the game feels like cannon fodder, except for the epic units and structures. Every faction feels like the Zerg in this regard, except with much less interesting units. I can see some semblance of a rock-paper-scissors type balance between units, but they all die so quickly that it seems to have a negligible effect on gameplay.TL;DR: Poor level design, boring units, nostalgia-boner status = killed. I regret buying this game.			"

												Petroglyph delivers yet again.  A game as fun as universe at war yet not as buggy.The three race dynamic is one that has been in use since Starcraft put it on the map and this game does it justice.  Each of the factions has a unique infrastructure and units that make for wildly different strategies when played.  There is a single player campaign that involves cut scenes and voice acting which has a high production quality.  SP and MP will give plenty of value out of this game.At times there seems to be a balance issue but that may be just my perception with only 10+ hours into the game thus far.The interface could use some improvement in some places, but overall you feel in complete control of your forces and are not limited by interface restraints as you are in some of the other RTSes that I have played lately.Keep it coming Petro.UPDATE #1: Petro, why only 4 players?  We need bigger maps and bigger battles.			"

												A game that both old and new fans of RTS can get into and enjoy equally. The campaign alone is quality and is well worth checking out. An epic military science-fiction setting and story with well made CGI cutscenes and briefing sections from characters inbetween the actual missions to flash out the story more. Besides the campaign, the game offers a Skirmish, LAN and online multiplayer modes with about about a dozen (I forgot how many maps were there exactly at the time I was typing this review) or so maps although the developers have confirmed that there will be more to come in the future, but fret not as this is covered by the awesome and competent custom map editor which, I hope, to see it grow with innovation from the community! The game is as traditional RTS as it gets but there is definitely a significant and unique take on its gameplay. There are three factions in the game and each faction is unique in its base building, unit variation, aesthetic, design, lore and its playstyle. As the name of the game suggests, the Goo faction is the main highlight as it's significantly different over the other two factions in the game (the Human & the Beta) but this does not mean that the other factions don't have any awesome tricks up their sleeves. All 3 factions are nicely balanced and worth trying out, which one is the best is entirely up to you, and that's the beauty of it. On the technical side of things, the performances does need a tiny bit more optimization as frame rates on a few occasions can plunge down by good bit when many units are battling it out on screen but for the most part the game runs smoothly and it isn't that demanding of your hardware to enjoy the sheer beauty of Grey Goo's battles and the lush world of Ecosystem 9. Overall, Grey Goo is a greatly polished and epic science-fiction RTS game well worth its selling price as it offers a good and quality campaign, a competent online multiplayer and a nice offline skirmish mode with a smart AI that can satisfy both casual and hardcore RTS fans. Petroglyh understands what made RTS games so fun and why it was superbly popular back then, but they also don't fear from bringing out something new! A familiar but unique RTS game that can be enjoyed by fans yet also pushes forward and oozes with innovation... ALL THIS plus Frank Klepacki's awesome, AWESOME music. I am looking forward to seeing Petroglyph expand on its new IP with new and gripping campaigns which will flash out the story and lore  evenmore in the future, I hope for the community and mulitplayer to grow and signifies its success as a really good RTS. My final score for Grey Goo is a superb 9/10 from me. One of the funnest and best RTS games that I've played in years! :)			"

												This review is only about my singleplayer experience. I didn't play multiplayer and reading other reviews it's said to be dead anyway.The good:The first impression is quite good, elaborate menu animation, a lot of high quality render cutscenes, ingame graphics are nothing to worry about, the general quality is high level. The different factions differ in base building, units can be enhanced with upgrades.The bad: setting and story is very basic, nothing getting me attached or thrilled Unit visuals just don't tell what their combat purpose is, you have to play and learn what unit shape is good against what. The unit information tells you one unit per faction that it is good against and weak against. This is hard to use and would have needed a better rock-papers-scissors system to work with. But even then, most units look way too similar in the beginning to differentiate them and in the end I just continued building those units that survived a battle from an originally mixed army. The levels in campaign neither have good design nor good visuals, it's always the same alien jungle theme, there are pathes leading to the enemy, that's it. Gather a strong army and go mowing the map. The advantage of being unseen on higher ground or standing in thickets to fire without enemy counter fire was never necessary nor that advantageous to use. The game start is way too slow, as you have to build your base with too few resources. It comes to boring waiting time until the base is built and you can start building an army. There is not much for the late game to do in your base, almost all units are available within your first 6 buildings. Especially the goo without typical base building is only hide and wait for growth in the beginning. Ultimate units are ridiculously ultimate. The long waiting time (again waiting) to build them does not excuse that they wipe out entire armies with just one shot. It's some fun to play if it is you going to♥♥♥♥♥♥the whole map with just one unit but it's not fun when playing against it - there are weakpoints like they cannot fire to close points.. but your damn slow units never reach that point etc AI: Well units fire back when they are in range of an enemy unit, but that's it. The player AI often bugged and stopped doing anything, ultimate units and armies just stood around somewhere on the map while I destroyed their main base.In total, the game looks like it wanted too much for too few people to achieve. The cutscenes look amazingly expensive, so it's sad to see that gameplay would have needed more money to be spent on it. I appreciate the try for a new rts but this is not recommendable for full price, buy it when in sale.			"

												I'm about four hours in and so far I've been enjoying it! I'm a big fan of Red Alert 2, Universe at War and many other Westwood and Petroglyph games and this definitely has the same impact and satisfying gamplay.Nice graphics, good music, good sound effects and it just generally feels good to play. I found myself cranking up the music volume which is always a good sign in a Westwood/Petroglyph title! Thanks, Frank Klepacki!Missions feel good so far and I tried some skirmishes too which were fun (even if I'm not very good yet!!).Unit voices are present and correct and sound good.So far my only real complaint is that the base-building with the Human and particularly Beta faction feels very clunky and strange. Structures have to be attached to each other in a kind of grid pattern and it feels odd and cluttered to me. I'd prefer just a normal Red Alert 2 -style building method, that's my favourite. Construction units can be OK too.I believe the Shroud faction has a normal building system though and the Goo has a far more novel system than the others.That aside though it's a fun title and my impression so far is around an 8/10 :)			"

												excellent game,RTS experienced players: good macro game, some matchups require nice micro but its a good balance between the two. long times between patches but thats usually fine. Small community, everybody knows everybody. and most ppl arent mean :P que times are always short, always somebody online.unexperienced players: This game is has a small community, resulting in ""mis-matches"". This means that new players often play against higher ranked people because the higher ranked people go into the que to find an opponent more often than a low ranked player. Although the matchmaking system does work, if you or another high ranked player are in que for 5+ minutes it puts you up against eachother.I'm rank 8 atm in this game, if you want to know more about the game - even if you don't know if you want to buy it add me and I can tell you more			"

												Great game idea! It's been a while since anyone came up with a new technology for a faction and the Goo definitely delivers! The three factions are asymmetrical and not without some small balance tweaks needed but it isn't as bad as some other games have been, needing big fixes right out of release. This game is very pleasing visually and smooth running . There are some disconnect issues in multiplayer and many including me are wanting support for more players per map and more official maps for us to use. It is very polished for what it is and has, and I look forward to the addition of more features that I miss from other RTSs such as;Engineer type units for capturing structuresBridges on the mapsAnd the one thing I miss more than anything; unit veterancy. Currently units do not get better with experience.Overall though, a great experience and worth the money, it can only get better!			"

												Grey Goo is a very traditional RTS. No hero units or unit leveling of any kind, minimal unit micro-management, a reasonably high unit cap and proper base building. It is also rather slow paced compared to the likes of Starcraft II.The production values are suprisingly high. Music and audio are great and campaign cutscenes are very impressive. Maps themselves are quite beautiful as well, even if most of the units and buildings look rather bland.Gameplay itself is very traditional. There's nothing wrong with this really, not every game needs to be super innovative. Especially in a genre which is pretty much dead these days. The game copies the classic Command & Conquer gameplay formula more or less intact.The game has four playable factions, the Humans, the Beta, the Goo and the Shroud. Humans and beta are very traditional RTS races that play very similarly to each other. The titular Goo, however, are something much more unique.The Goo don't have a traditional base at all and instead of collecting resources, mother goo units regenerate health while on a resource node. The mother goo can then sacrifice some of its health to create new units. This is certainly the most innovative aspect of the game. Unfortunately this also leads to some tedious micro-management and I wasn't personally a big fan of the playstyle.The shroud were not part of the original game and were added in a later patch. They only appear as an enemy in a bonus campaign mission and are also available for skirmish and multiplayer games. I didn't end up seeing enough of them to get a good feel of how they play.For the most part the unit design is quite boring for all factions, both visually and ability-wise. The ultimate Epic units are a lot more exciting, but they take a long time and lot of resources to build and you generally use only one per map.The user interface is for the most part quite decent and pretty much what you would except in an RTS. All the usual hotkeys are there and the controls work the way you expect them to. It's missing a few of the more advanced features, but overall the UI is decent enough.The campaign itself is passable but again nothing spectacular. The story is quite forgettable. Surely the titular grey goo (aka runaway self-replicating nanobots) could have been used to tell a more interesting story. Missions themselves are pretty standard fare for the most part, even if some of the missions spice up things a little bit. Personally I found the campaign difficulty surprisingly high. Usually I play single-player RTS games on hard, but after the first few missions I decided to switch to normal. Part of this difficulty does come from bad mission design, however, as a lot of missions have enemy units spawning from thin air.Personally I find Grey Goo rather hard to recommend unless you are a big RTS fan looking for a new game to play. There's nothing really wrong with the game but despite the high production values it suffers from some bland design and doesn't bring anything new to the genre. Best to wait for a sale or a bundle with this one.I played through the main campaign on normal and also finished the Emergence DLC mini-campaign. I also played a couple skirmish games against the AI. I don't normally play multiplayer with strangers, so I skipped that part of the game.The good:- Solid old-school RTS gameplay- Beautiful cut-scenes- Great music by Frank Klepacki (of C&C fame)The bad:- Visual design of the units and buildings is rather bland- Some issues with unit balance- Some annoying campaign missions- Forgettable story- Goo faction is interesting but ultimately not that fun to play- Map visuals can be somewhat confusing at times and it's hard to tell what's passable terrain and what's not- Very strict line of sight rules are too easy to exploitThe ugly:- Performance could be better- Saving and especially loading take a very long time			"

												What can i say, it's a huge disappointment. After Universe at War you would think Petroglyph would learn from their mistakes and actually improve. They did not. Grey Goo is a very generic RTS, to the point where, halfway through the campaign, you are just gathering all units and then just ctrl+a clicking on the other end of the map.Graphic wise Grey Goo looks decent, at least for me. Runs smoothly 60 frames, although there are hiccups every now and then, especially with more than 100 units on the screen, which do not happen too often. Audio is a strong aspect of the game, good old orchestral score intertwined with some rock riff and veeeery cheesy dubstep/techno fragments.The campaign was also the strong aspect of every RTS game. GG campaign had a lot of potential, but it felt either unfinished, or only a part of some bigger story. Cinematics are well made, transitions between missions and debriefings smoothly continues the story. However, the campaign also unravels the game biggest weakness. The resources it possess, buildings and units, are very limited, which in many cases reduces the strategy to simply pumping up main battle/tank units and just unleashing them on the other side of the map, without the need for artillery or siege/support units. Just focus on MBU and crank that♥♥♥♥♥♥up to eleven, occasionally add a couple of AA and that's it, the whole strategy.You can play skirmish, but, as I said earlier, you will get bored pretty fast. The DLC faction, the Shroud, actually adds a new and interesting mechanics, based upon the interaction between the low and high tier units and reintroduces the need for support units. The rest is a standard RTS mechanics: refinery with extractors, mineral/catalyst fields, structures operated upon modular interactions, rock/paper/scissor units weaknesses. The titular Goo is a copy of Morphids from Earth 2016, with certain exceptions, like lack of aircraft and fairly weak units, which leaves you to operate on masses of units that need quite a lot of time to produce.Multiplayer is mostly empty, you can find an opponent every now and then, for some 1v1. Kinda hard to actually attract people with such premises with so many better alternatives out there on the market.In my opinion, it is not worth the price, i'v grabbed it in E3 bundle for 4 Euros, so i can't complain, but its standard price, generic mechanics and bland gameplay successfully discourages people from buying it.

												This is what I have been waiting for. A actual RTS with base building and large armies. If your like me who have grown tired of the trend that Base Building is seen as a con in strategy games.Im not giving a full a review because I havent played the other factions. But their is a warning i must give to those who like replays. As far as I know there arent any options to watch  replays of previous matches for both skirmish and multiplayer. So thats my only gripe.my fav faction so far is the Beta.			"

												I have been waiting for Grey Goo to come out for a while now and glad that it has.  While I have had some issues with the gamma (screen a bit dark for my liking) the game has so far ran smooth and I have only ran into one bug that was not game breaking.The game follows the tried and true formula of 3 factions.  The Beta here play like Humans do in most other games. Then you have the humans which play with a bit more advanced looking technology than the Beta and finally you have the truely alien race that plays by overwhelming your forces the Grey Goo.  Think Zerg if the Zerg were a machine like fluid race.The game itself plays a lot like the classical Command and Conquer series than Starcraft though.  Personally I like it's slower pace.  Well at least when playing Beta against Human.  The Goo is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥personally.  Between it being overwhelming and having bases that can move around the map, sometimes they will have you yelling at your screen as you try to track down that last bit of Goo.  All in all though I have at the time of this posting just under seven and a half hours play time with Grey Goo and they have been very fun.  I highly recommend the game.			"

												Its a really good RTS and runs so freakin smooth and what's this you can build a base and use it WHAAAAT?!?! I had a few issues with it running on WIN10 but it was able to fix it by not launching the game from Steam. I do think the factions are a little unbalanced but I didn't buy it to play MP with random people. So can't comment to much on that side of things sorry.- Great GFX- Great SFX- Good Story line - Hard mode can actually be tough at times and the AI (least what I can tell) doesn't seem to cheat to make it ""Tough"".Very much worth getting this game now while its on sale!!

												Grey Goo is an interesting game.The design is centered around keeping things simple: there are few units and they have no abilities and not much in the way of upgrades.  The interface is one of the best I've ever seen for an RTS.  And while after playing about 50 online PvP matches I still am not 100% decided on how much meat there is on the bone.  I don't think this is a game of endless strategic discovery.  That might no be a bad thing, it depends on your preference in this regard.As of now I am still having fun, after all the game looks fantastic and it plays smoothly and is responsive.My biggest concern is the design of the factions.  You have to play each faction differently and because of that there are built-in advantages given to each faction and to be successful you must explore those, and in the end it can feel a bit like ""I was forced to play this way"" - because, to be honest playing another way just won't work.Take the Humans for example, you simply have no option to expand.  You have to turtle up in your base.The Beta have to expand, but are much weaker in unit power and compositionthe Goo has to be constantly on the move and making short term, quick decisions since they spawn units right on the battlefield.  You must have a pretty healthy apm to play them well.If you don't mind that sort of paint by number approach to your options then you may end up enjoying this game greatly.After about 30 hours of play time in I do recommend this game for people who are looking for a responsive, fun, old-school RTS game but don't necessarily need a ton of new discovery to be baked in to their game play.single player is fairly short with some cool missions, overall it was fun to romp through themskirmish is there and it's goodbiggest complaint is that multiplayer is limited to 4 players max.  That seems like a big mistake and step backwards in the genre.  This fact alone will assuredly hurt sales and RTS + MOBA games have baked in play groups already established and playing with 3 other friends in a game makes it easier to expand sales and entice new players and expand the community size, which right now seems small.

												I do not advise any RTS lover to take up with this game, at all.  Multiplayer is reportedly dead, which is understandable given that it's not exactly new at this point.  Worse yet though, single player is crippled by the lack of stable servers.  Really?!  Single-player?  And why is that???  Because you cannot save your game without a good connection to their server.  The supposed Steam cloud support for this game doesn't appear to use the Valve servers; instead using their own.  It would be bad enough if the save just failed ... no it does that, takes a long time to do it, and then if if it fails it actually KICKS YOU OUT OF THE GAME.  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻    Nice eh?Now before anyone asks, no I am NOT using wireless.  I routinely play Starcraft 2 and Rocket League which require live real-time connections at all times, and I NEVER lose a game or am otherwise thrown out of my game because of connection issues.  Searching through the forums on this issue, I see the developers coyly asking 'well, are you using wireless?' as if that excuses this P.O.S. design!!!Beyond that most irritating issue, the gameplay itself is sub-par.  I like the abilities of the buildings to build in parallel, how resources gaps can pause build queues, and the ability to specific perpetual build queues but then they have crippled the pace of the game by not allowing the player to start with or build a reasonable number of resources at a fast enough pace in the beginning of the game.  The result is that the first part of any match, even in single-player, is a slog towards actual gameplay.  Strategy does enter into the early game in the form of building configurations, pace of resource consumption, types of units that can be built at one time, etc. but it's very difficult to try out the various options without risking complete disaster because of the above save issue.  You may just have to start over and over again just to figure it out.Which brings me to my next point, there is very little explanation of unit capabilities offered to the user.  The various buildings mostly enable various types of units, and you'll be able to make many units at once if you configure your base properly, but you'll mostly be forced to just amass units and zerg rush opponents because you have very little information about what units can do.  Again, see above the for the save issue that prevents meaningful trial and error.All in all, I wanted to love this game.  It's a pretty game in action, and it presented enough new gameplay ideas to be interesting, but it's far too irritating to continue with it in this state.AVOID!			"

Decent. The CGI scenes? Excellent. The missions themselves? Challenging. The rest of the game? Underwhelming. Low amount of content for a game claiming to be AAA. Universe at War and Empire at War has way more content than GG. Even the graphics settings are underwhelming, like there is no settings for AA, shadows, etc. There very few maps and the game can only go up to 4 players. The lack of map scrolling by holding down one of the mouse buttons is disappointing.There is a population cap which is a no for me. The upgrades are quite bland, doesn't really change the units. The railgun upgrade for the mammoth tanks in Tiberium Wars, now that's an upgrade. As for the units, they're just units. They don't have the same amount of character as the units in C&C. Crazy Ivan anyone?The soundtrack is pretty nice but the sound quality is kind of crap. The sound quality for the songs I have is way better than the games soundtrack. Don't buy the DLC soundtrack because it only has 10 out of the 31 tracks. Do not be fooled by those who said this game is like C&C, it's not. If you're going to get this game, wait until the price drops. >>>I'll only recommend this game if you're in it for the story and the soundtrack. But I will be looking forward to the continuation of the story.<<<Best RTS game? Not even close. Starcraft, Supreme Commander (not including the second one), and Command & Conquer (from Tiberian Dawn to Red Alert 3 Uprising) will remain at the top. Honorable mentions: Warhammer, Universe at War, Empire at War, and Sins of a Solar Empire. Westwood =/= PetroglyphWestwood is not back nor will they ever. When will you silly Westwood fanboys realize that? Such a shame that Petroglyph abandoned End of Nations, it had potential before the dreadful change. Stop getting honey dicked by things like this from Petroglyph. http://i.imgur.com/yiwoQEp.pngTLDR: 6.9/10 Overpriced and underwhelming for a AAA game.5/10 FOR POOR POST LAUNCH SUPPORT			"

												This game belongs right next to my top RTS games.Haven't played multiplayer but as far as the singleplayer and campaign goes this game is a gem among the rubble.The story is great! Something I don't expect from RTS games these days. I'd go as far to say the storyline is just as great as the one from Starcraft2. (Not entirely but a great start to say the least.)The game itself has 3 very interresting factions although the humans play kinda... mhe, they could use an overhaul to make em usefull... anyway that's my opinion Also is this a bit slower pased RTS more like the ones from the golden days, it stands next to Red Alert2 & C&C Generals.Also I can't say it enough but this is a fully polished game. Every aspect has been thought about. Not to forget some damn good voice acting and cutscenes.If you are a fan the old play style of RTS games and surely like a good campaign/storyline/SP then this is a must have for you!

A Sci-Fi Real Time Strategy Game

+ Similar to games like Command and Conquer and Starcraft (yet not nearly as fast paced). I absolutely loved the pacing of the game. If you enjoyed C&C 3 Tiberium Wars or Kane's Wrath, you will likely find yourself at home with this game.+ Amazing soundtrack with some truly epic songs+ Very unique story setup / campaign. You actually start off playing as the alien ""Beta"" race who is seemingly being invaded by humans and ""The Goo"". You then play as the humans and find out the humans accidentally created the goo and team up with the Betas to defeat the Goo. Then you get to play as the Goo.+ Visually the game looks excellent, rivaling other RTS games and often exceeding my expectations.+ Great level design that are often very colorful and pleasent to gaze at while encourage exploring.+ The 3 races you get to play as are all very unique with a variety of different units, and unique building mechanics that you will need to learn to excel in the game.+ Every mission is story based and have unique objectives which keeps the campaign from getting repetitive. + Super Units, although costly you can make truly grand scale units like a flying fortress that shoots nukes, has turrets, and can manufacture units. The Beta's have an enourmous sentinel that fires a highly destructive laser. + Quite a lot of content. I believe there's 16 full missions + 3 DLC missions which will take around 10hours+ to finish- The difficulty in this game is a bit too high. I found that even playing on Easy was a challenge at times, especially when trying to learn which units I needed to build as each mission is dramatically different.- The story itself and character development is lacking in some areas. I often found myself being a bit confused on what was happening. - The name of the game... ""Grey Goo"" is just silly to me, and likely caused this game to fall into obscurity far too quickly. Even in game hearing lines like ""We must warn them about the Goo!!"" is just laughable. I really wish they would have chosen a better name. Perhaps something like ""Molecular Nanobots"" would have been more fitting. - The ending story-wise was pretty poorly scripted and a bit odd to be honest. Basically every race ends up pointing fingers at one another. The Goo basically stops at nothing to get the catalyst they need to defend against ""The Silent Ones"" who are planet destroying aliens you face at the end of the game. The Betas (Alien Race) are just trying to survive, and were unfairly attacked by the humans and the goo, and blame the Humans for creating the Goo. The Humans are caught in the middle trying to destroy the Goo even though the Goo are trying to ultimately defend the Humans from the Silent Ones.  (Confusing? Yeah.... )- The DLC campaign in my opinion should have been part of the main campaign. It's sort of like they just removed a chunk of the campaign and put it as DLC, and it contains some pretty important story elements concerning Singelton which was never explained in the main campaign.~ The multiplayer is fun, but the community is largely dead so I would not suggest buying this for multiplayer.In my eyes, this game is a hidden gem. If you like RTS games you should pick this up on sale sometime. :)			"

												As I read through some of the reviews. I had to make my own. Which I never do unless a game is HORRIBLE or awesome. So here we go and you may not like my opinions but again....its my opinion. I also typed fast so my spelling sucks. GG is an amazing game for any long time RTS fan's or just starting out. The cut scenes and CGI are phenomenal and stunning. The music is some of the best since Total Annihilation... Alot of games these days feel like theres no COMPELLING story anymore, But the story for GG is very well done and at the end of the game you just want more. When it was first released it was very buggy but the developers really listened to the fans which you don't get often. Even though there isn't alot of levels prepare yourself....they can last an hour without you even knowing, The skirmish levels are just as good with the AI. There not just getting resources and rarely attacks you. They bring EVERYTHING at you. Which is fun and hectic. I grew up playing Total Annihilation,Command and Conquer, Starcraft (part 1 only,sorry part 2 was A$$). So I know RTS games. My only complaint was the price and they shouldve added water/navy units! Bottomline is I havent played a decent RTS game since.......I don't even know haha.			"

												Grey Goo is a simply excellent modern Real Time Strategy.Perhaps the simplest way to describe this game is ""Not-Starcraft"". Whilst your units have many unique and interesting abilities, they are all passive, and so you won't be needing any hotkey mastery to use them. That's not to say managing your army is easy; keeping tabs on some of the more unique factions such as the beautifully fresh Goo can be exhilirating. But overall, this is a simpler RTS, a throwback to a simpler time.The story mode is a lot better than I was expecting, with some lovely CG cutscenes backed up by 10/10 music by Frank Klepacki. This game is worth it for the soundtrack alone, with different themes for each of the 4 factions. Each faction has a different feel, in gameplay, design, and music, which makes them all feel exciting to play.Cannot reccomend this highly enough to any RTS fan.			"

												I need to see the lore expanded. Grey Goo: The Novels. Grey Goo: The Movie. Grey Goo: The Saturday Morning Cartoon. Grey Goo: The Lunchbox. Grey Goo: The Flamethrower. Expansions are acceptable, too, but please, more than just three missions and a tiny missing piece of story!Make it happen.Edit: And lo, they have added a new faction /as an update/. Took me a minute to wrap my head around the fact I didn't need to buy an expansion, DLC, or season pass, they just sort of... added it in. Granted, it came with only one campaign mission, which may not be enough to introduce the faction as well as the other three, but it's a step in the right direction. I can already taste Grey Goo: The Energy Drink.			"

												Perhaps one of the best games for easing people into the RTS genre due to its hotkey system.  And hopefully with it being $4 on humble bundle at the moment, hopefully the influx of new players will breathe life back into the dying multiplayer that is earning it so many negative reviews.Still don't know why they added a fourth race though.

												An old school RTS that includes a fine campaign covering all 3 sides, each with a distinctive playstyle. Slower play speed than most modern games, and the resource nodes can be harvested faster than they recharge so it can take a bit to get used to.Overall having fun with it and one of the most polished RTS I have played since Starcraft 2/Dawn of War.

												""In the end, ""Grey Goo"" is indeed a welcome throwback to the classics I've grown up with and is worth plenty of repeat visits.  It does everything it can to make your life easier (what with the QWERT keybind controls and auto-harvesters for the Humans and Beta) but falls short on the skirmish/multiplayer side of things.  It really would have been awesome to have the ability to set up and see a ""4 vs 4"" or ""2 vs 3"" or something along those lines.  I also found the AI to be a bit too aggressive and difficult, even on ""easy"".  I lost many matches against the ""easy"" AI and I consider myself to be a moderately experienced RTS player (though I admittedly love to turtle, which this game seems to discourage).  This ruthlessness will most certainly frustrate newcomers to no end and at times, I honestly wished that I could tell the AI to tone it down a bit and expand more slowly.  With the above issues in mind, those short on money may want to wait for a price drop (like I would have done had I not received a press key).""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/grey-goo/

A Paladin’s Review: Grey Goo. I Review, So That Others May Play Good Games.Genre: Sci-Fi Real Time Strategy Title With Singleplayer & Multiplayer.Developed & Published by: Petroglyph & Grey Box.Platform: Windows only.Business Model: Base Game + DLC.Copy Gifted by a Friend Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]PreambleFor Steam readers I would recommend ignoring my rating for this review. I have to give the game something and I'm not willing to vote it down but neither am I comfortable with the vote up. Steam really needs to add a middle ground option.Overall Gameplay ThoughtsGrey Goo is a Command & Conquer styled real-time-strategy game centered around three races with their own unique playstyles. The game comes packed with features including Steam workshop support, single & multiplayer modes, ranked/unranked matchmaking, custom game support and player profiles. Grey Goo’s main campaign features high quality cutscenes and a reasonable story arc for each race. So, there’s the Beta who are considered the “balanced” race in terms of offense and defense with their bullet and missile weapons. Their unique features include being able to deploy buildings anywhere on the map without directly tied to the main mother base and walls that can be manned by units. The Humans are the technologically advanced race and are generally more defense oriented. Everything about them is tied into one core base, with any of their buildings requiring power coming directly from said base. Finally, there’s the Goo, the most unique race both in presentation and playstyle. This race of nanorobots is a collective intelligence that use large formless units that can split off to create other types of units. They generally tend to be more aggressive than the other two races as their formless units can do significant damage to enemy units if in close proximity. Some of their strengths are offset but their complete lack of air units. All three have their own unique attributes while sticking largely to the core of Grey Goo’s mechanics.Strategy Mechanics ConversationThe Beta and Human races play out very similarly to each other. Both have a single base they are tied to, build generally the same buildings and have the same type of units. Each builds resource collectors that have harvesters transport resources from the collector back to the harvester. Both races then use these resources to carefully build more resource harvesters, tech buildings or factories. Technology buildings grant access to more advanced units and tech upgrades that can further enhance certain units. However, these tech upgrades are restricted to one change per type of unit. They tend to be helpful in certain situations but are otherwise not going to massively change how you play. When a player has lost all of their production buildings and main base, it’s game over. The Goo race on the other hand is unique though they ultimately have the same types of units and win/loss conditions as well. Instead of constructing buildings, they use Mother Goos to build up their forces. These giant formless masses can attack units, go to resource points and split off other Mother Goos or Proteans. They must stay on resource points as long as possible in order to build up mass which leaves them vulnerable to harassment. Proteans are smaller formless units that have a higher speed than Mothers, enabling them to attack or create light/heavy units depending on which protean they are. which can then be transformed to light or heavy units depending on the player. Once all Mother Goos are destroyed, they lose. PC Settings, Performance Problems & Audio/VideoPerformance in Grey Goo is disastrous despite months of patching and promises from the developers that it would be fixed. The entire main menu has severe lag, only managing to get somewhere in the realm of 20-40FPS. Why it’s so poor is unclear but it seems to be an engine issue. Cutscenes also have the same framerate problems and it’s really too bad because they are quite well done. It’s quite irritating to see this too when my CPU is only 45-50% consumed when Grey Goo is running. My GTX 970 should be able to easily handle this title but the framerate counter seems to indicate otherwise. The in-game situation isn’t much better as the framerate will go from a solid 60 to a mere 30-45 when a base is under construction. Turning every graphics option down to minimum helps things but it doesn’t fix the menu framerate lag and games can still bring the framerate down. It’s unclear why Grey Goo continues to suffer performance problems despite months of work but it’s definitely a problem worth considering if you’re interested in the title. It’s certainly frustrating enough for me to now want to play it. I could be much more understanding if the CPU/GPU was near max while playing Grey Goo. But it’s not. I did consult with their tech support over the course of several weeks in order to identify the issue but they didn’t have any suggestions on fixing it. Instead, they insisted that that my computer wasn’t up to the task. A computer that meets or exceeds the minimum required specs stated on the Steam store page. Narrative DiscussionDuring the campaign, you’ll be able to experience the three races in the following order. Beta, Human and last but not least, Goo. Each race is given five missions each for a total of 15. All three races have the same gameplay arc. You’re first given a very small army and no access to the race’s tech tree. The next three missions gradually unlock units and upgrades as you go along. The missions getting gradually more difficult as well. The fifth mission is the big event of the campaign, allowing the player to use the race’s Epic unit and all technology available. Overall, the campaign feels short even though it’s about 10 hours long. I’ll admit, I didn’t particularly enjoy the campaign either. Mostly because I did the same things to win mission after mission and the three race buildup starts creating a very samey feeling. It also doesn’t help that it feels like content has been cut from the game.Final ThoughtsI think Grey Goo is a reasonable modern take on the C&C formula established so long ago. There’s a decent amount of strategy involved and each race feels uniquely its own and fairly well balanced. Unfortunately, the multiplayer has been falling apart since release and doesn’t seem to be showing signs of returning any time soon. The 20min+ long queues at this point make it even more of an anti-recommendation at this point. The story narrative also has multiple problems and I don’t really think the game is worth getting for it alone. At the very least, it’s questionable value for money, especially the DLC. Credit to the devs though, they have supported Grey Goo pretty well over the past year with multiple balance updates, new features and minor content additions. I think they’re pinning a little too much hope on it becoming a e-sport though. It’s just a pity that the engine problems and the expensive price haven’t been shored up during the course of this year, as I have no doubt that’s what has kept the multiplayer community from growing. Ultimately, while Grey Goo as an RTS is possible to enjoy at times, I have trouble recommending it due to the performance problems, shrinking multiplayer community and multiple story issues.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												Grey goo is a fantasticly fun game with an entirely unqiue ""Goo"" faction. If you miss the days of Tiberium Sun and the good old Red Alert series then you'll love this game as much as I do. The campaign is a bit on the short side, but the story and the multiplayer is great!			"

												I unreservedly recommend this game to RTS fans everywhere. Grey Goo is a completely new RTS universe with a distinctly Command and Conquer vibe.I consider myself a long time fan of Petroglyph games. I put possibly upwards of 100 hours into Universe at War, and was perhaps one of the only people who signed up for Games for Windows Live solely to play ranked multiplayer in the game. I was in the beta for aborted games Mytheon and End of Nations and was in fact one of the most outspoken proponents of this latter game. But the bitter taste left in my mouth by End of Nations’ demise left me jaded at best when it comes to supporting games and, sadly, especially those by Petroglyph.GRAPHICSI always like to start with the low hanging fruit: typically, the graphics. The game is pretty good looking for what it is, though certainly not in the way that Company of Heroes is. Units and structures in Grey Goo are detailed, but look almost intentionally modeled after plastic or pewter game pieces – Human units in particular evoke the minimalism of white plastic chessmen. In contrast, the scenery is verdant and wild, with industrialized set pieces in particular looking pretty darn nifty. The game’s color palette, especially that of the terrain, tends to be a little muddy, with most guides out there recommending that Gamma be set to 125% to get better visualization, particularly on twilight maps where the sunsets oranges and purples serve to further muddy things up visually. Visually, my only real complaint is the look of large outcroppings of rock or catalyst veins. The jungle scenery and mechanized terrain doodads are quite well done, but large aggregations of rock or ‘hardened Goo’ textures just don’t do it for me in this game. Easily my favorite visuals in Grey Goo are the Goo factions “formless” units – that is, Mother Goos and Proteans, and the Human Core. The Core pulses, throws out holograms, and has awesome little shimmery lines all throughout. To me, it’s one of the most visually striking command centers in a game, and feels very much like the beating heart of the Human faction. Proteans contain some neat fluid dynamics and despite their near featurelessness are pretty iconic in their own right. I do wish, however, that there was some additional distinction between Small, Large and Mother proteans. Mama Goos have a little glowing cluster crowning their blob to set themselves apart, but Large Proteans in particular seem to lack a defining characteristic.CAMPAIGNThis article is already tediously long, but single player is very important to many RTS gamers so I feel I cannot again leave this out. I can unreservedly recommend Grey Goo to RTS gamers who are looking for a decent story. Grey Goo’s story is not a hackneyed yarn about contesting some magical resource – catalyst is just a thing. It’s important, but not Spice Melange or Tiberium important. It’s not a space opera, comic bookish yarn about prophecies or magical space crystals – it’s much more Asimov than Lucas in its presentation. It’s a story of confusion and loss, of protecting populaces and understanding foes. It’s incredibly well presented in terms of production and actually fairly challenging – I had to change the game difficulty after the 4th campaign mission. Like the rest of the game, Grey Goo’s campaign isn’t pretentious or over the top, just well crafted and remarkably solid. I say bravo here...C&CGrey Goo is assuredly a game in the lineage of Command and Conquer. Many of the design choices have taken nods from the classic Westwood experience – the semi-automated nature of resource harvesting, the renewable (and single) resource, the necessity of player to watch their expenditures so as to not stall out their production, the soul of this game is the soul of Command and Conquer games in many ways. But its heart is its own. Those who are nostalgic about Command and Conquer are more likely to enjoy it than others, but the combat model is not what they’d expect from C&C games. StarCraft gamers may find the game shallow or slow, though perhaps they might find the pace refreshing and the combat interesting, as I do. Those interested in single player are likely to be satisfied with the well composed story and interesting faction variation. There’s a lot here to love, if what was left out of the game (relative to whatever you’re comparing it with) isn’t a deal-breaker for you.			"

												Great game and and a nice modern make of the old school rts. yes i agree that there are some small problem but updates are coming and the game has already had some updates and alot of them have been adressed already. This game has some cool factions and some sweet graphics. and for the people giving bad reviews alot of them have had like 10 hours max on the game. yea the interface is new but once you get use to it its very good. i think the guys have done a great job with this game. And people giving bad reviews good chance got there a** handed to them rather than take the time to learn the game. as for the price yes i would say it is a bit too high and thats one thing lower the price please i have so many friends intrested in the game but they are asking a bit much. i have alredy bought myself and a friend a copy but i hope that money goes towards the development of the game . they are a small company give it some time it took sc1 & 2 a good year to get to where it is at now . so if you like the look of the game its only money and you will get your moneys worth . peace "

												Great game with a decent campaign.. The game is cool if you don't mind references from other games including SC..  The Beta and Human are fun to play and  look awesome with some very original ideas.. The epics are great. The Goo is what kills the fun of the game.. The Goo is an over powered faction that is impossible to play against.. They have no flying units so to compensate they have endless supply units that can climb mountains, attack from out of range that can only be destroyed by flying units from other factions that have to go back to base to restock ammo.. The Goo's multiple bases are mobile and climb mountains which is horrible in the campaign and in mp/skirmishBecause of the Goo faction the game feels half done.. It's a great game but its not worth the cost of admittance.. If the other Mother Goo's had a time limit or flying units had endless ammo.. then maybe it would be worth while..  Wait for a sale..			"

												Grey Goo is a Real-Time Strategy game made by veterans of Westwood, the studio responsible for Command and Conquer (before EA bought them and hollowed them out).  Featuring three interesting, asymmetrical factions, the goal of the game is to harvest Catalyst, the one resource in the game, and use it to create units to beat up bad guys.Pros:+Namesake Goo faction is a unique faction that does not construct buildings, opting to instead produce its units from Mother Goos+Unusual movement options combine with a large scale to create a game with an epic scale as well as interesting micro options+Interesting takes on various units; no unit is a direct comparison to the similar-niche unit from another side.  For example: Beta artillery leaves behind mines, Human artillery can fire on the move, Goo artillery leaves a pool of corrosive acid that heals units+Good graficks+Awesome cutscenes and story delivery, nice fluffy universe that makes you want moreCons:-no extremely interesting units aside from the epic units; mostly standard fare for an RTS-short campaign (15 missions, 5 with each side)-Other reviews report poor multiplayer balance-only 4 players on a map "

												This is a great RTS game. It's mostly an old-school type RTS. By that I mean it's based on strategy not how fast you can click. And with really unique factions. The story is very well done and very well told. New things are being added to the game at a moderate pace, so it's good to have this in your library. (Like a whole new race for free, totally worth reinstalling.) I enjoy this much more than starcraft 2, because there hasn't been a single time I've lost because I didn't click around fast enough, it's always been I was genuinily outdone strategically.My only dislike is the community, everyone is very nice and friendly.  THEY'RE ALL JUST SO GOOD AT THIS.3/29/16 EditI'm now plat league after getting throughly spanked for a while. But now, with my behind well toned from the spanking, I am doing some spanking of my own! And you can too!			"

												Honestly Grey Goo feels like an RTS from a much older era... and I mean that in a good way!I can't remember the last time there was a good RTS.  For example:Dawn of War II killed the feel of Warhammer, with only a handful of units and a SINGLE building.Command and Conquer 4 ended up being a very expensive game of rock-paper-scissors, again with a SINGLE building.Company of Heroes II shrunk the battlefield so much that you could pretty much throw rocks at the enemy just as easily as hit them with a tank shell.Grey Goo is an RTS from back when RTS's hadn't been MOBA'd to death.  And that's saying something.Plus... free content and DLC?  That's pretty unusual nowadays!			"

												After a year and a free expansion I think I can safely say this was worth the purchase. Here is the rundown.Pros:- Not two, not three, but FOUR asymmetrical factions! Each with their own base building, units and epic unit.- A very traditional RTS with a healthy balance between micro and macro. You will need strategy and tactics to be the best.- Amazing detail to individual units, both in animation and sound design.- A competent single player campaign with pretty CGI cutscenes.- An AI that, after lots of tweaking, is fun in Skirmish with lots of dynamic responses.- Astounding soundtrack by Frank Klepacki with an in-game jukebox! (The OST DLC now includes all songs as well)- THEY JUST RELEASED A FREE EXPANSION-UPDATE! The publisher Greybox have been nothing but amazing with supporting the customers with patches and content.Cons:- A somewhat unoptimised engine can tax systems on ultra settings.- Aforementioned engine means that 4 players is the max limit. Personally I like a minimum of 6 players in my RTS games.- Not many people playing anymore so don't expect an active multiplayer community. Grab a friend or three for PVE and PVP.- Balance for PVP is an issue. Though they are still patching.If you like Command & Conquer, Starcraft, and even lesser known games like Perimeter then you'll have fun with Grey Goo!			"

												Overall the game is good. Quality is good. There are some small kinks and issues, like region lock (there's a workaround), missing replay functionality (developer confirmed that it will be released later) and some bugs (the game was just released and it's not worse than my previous experience with any fresh release), but nothing that would stop me from playing.Single player campaign starts off slow, but gets better as it goes on. Towards the last part of the campaign there's much revealed about the story and it gets good. Campaign is of good quality although a bit short. In the end, it's worth the price of the game and I will not hesitate to buy the game again.As an old cnc/ra fan I definitely recommend Grey Goo if you enjoyed those old rts games "

												I usually dont bother to rate stuff on the internet but I think Grey Goo deserves a better rating than it currently has.I played a lot of Starcraft 2 (and many other RTS)  but it was too much clicking so it was always hard to follow a specific strategy. In Grey Goo much stuff is semi-automated (ressource collection/unit production) though there are differences between races, this gives more time to watch over your units, scouts and what not, plus it plays a little bit slower and the camera is further up. I really like how the game plays and you can still get some serious skills in it (just check the grey goo youtube channel for pro games). The Campaign is allright and I managed to finish all except the last mission on hard and I'm not really a good player, took me around 20 hours. Story is also ok, not a blast but ok. Haven't played multiplayer yet but I shouldn't expect too many opponents from what I've heard, but maybe the community will grow ;). About the three... ahem, four races I can say the same as everyone, Goo is unique(only time I saw something similiar was in ""Earth 2150 or 2160""), Human and Beta aren't too different but its ok imo and then there's the Shroud, needs some more testing but definetly feels different from the other races. All in all a very solid game with nice developers (just got a new race yesterday for free!). And then there is the price drop, I think the ""high"" price of ~45€ was a reason for many people not to buy. 28€ is absolutely fair and you'll definetly get a game worth the money (if not worth more).

												Single player campaign is linear and boring. Game is not optimized and has huge frame drops. You start with 120+ FPS and drop down to <25FPS in mid game, and below 20FPS in the late game. I have a more then decent machine that easily plays FarCry 4 and other similar games on Ultra. Therefore it is easy to conclude it is not my machine but a poor optimized game that ruins the game experience.Multiplayer is terrible. Very little players play online. Only very few maps and tons of them are not designed for competitive matches. Next to that, they are copy/pasted from the Single Player campaign. Unit design is flat and boring. There are no cool moves you can do. Epic units look and sound cool, but are a total MP killer. Simply no fun in operating them and/or killing them.After 3 months the game still does not have replays, observer mode or a ladder you can view in your browser. On top of that, disconnecting happens all the time and gives the DCing player no loss or ban. You simply get away with it and they dev's do absolutely nothing about it. Worst part is the developers though. They hate to communicate clearly and all the say is 'we are working on it'. They don't listen to the community and blatant balance issues lingered around for months and flaws in map design haven't even been touched yet. Each patch brakes another thing and they fail to acknowledge or fix it. Last patch fixed nothing the community wanted. On top of that the game lags even more due to their 'fixes'. The developers act like they know what they do, but they clearly have no clue.A quote from the Grey Goo game designer on Twitter:""I'm done with this game""- the rallying cry of a forum poster that if was truly done would have just quit quietly without a 1000 word essay. - Jeffrey GamskySays enough about the developers doesn't it?I honestly wanted this game to be a success. Yet the clear lack of honest communication and 'we know it way better then the community' attitude killed this game beyond repair. The game itself is mediocre currently. Might turn decent if they manage to fix the fps/lag issues. I do not recommend you to buy this this game. The developers simply do not deserve it and you can get way better games for your hard earned money.			"

												This game is made by the developers of Westwood Studios who had enough of Electronic Sharts crap to leave and develop Petroglyph Studios.. Now that I have your attention. Let me start off by saying this game has a very good Command and Conquer feel, while also having a Starcraft 2 Rock, Paper, Scissors triangle of units to counter what with what. The graphics are amazing and the workshop for making maps is alive and well.The 3 unique factions are the Humans, Beta and the Goo, The humans are trying to find places to colonize. The Beta (pronounced Bee-ta) are trying to escape from something, The Goo are trying to absorb everything om nom nom. If you loved all the C&C titles (Except C&C4 we don't talk about that aborted fetus) Give this a shot. Its definitely worth the full price.			"

												I've played quite alot of RTS in my time from the good old command and conquer series to starcraft then warcraft, and few others great RTS Classics.  I have to say Greygoo is a great addition to the RTS genre's I mean I haven't seen a good RTS since Dawn of War back in 2008. Once I heard about Grey Goo I though what the hell is this! Then after watching videos and actually getting to play the game I loved it. I mean music in the game is made by Frank Klepacki and if you enjoyed all the classic command and conquer music and  red alert 1&2 my god he does some good stuff. I do recommend this game to anyone who likes the old feel of an RTS building, expanding and waging war upon your enemies. The GreyGoo may be a very odd name for an RTS, but actually it fits quite perfectly for the Race the Grey Goo and what I mean by this is the race is very unique from any RTS I've seen the way you can form your units and gathering resources  it different, then your Goo can run over everything and when I mean everything I mean EVERYTHING!!!! it insane.

												Enojyed this game very much. Yeah, maybe it can be seen as ""similar"" to Starcraft, but I enjoyed the slower gameplay and the different storyline. Some parts, mainly when I was playing the Goo, were difficult and challenging for me to play.But the real impact was in the ever present spreading ""Silence"" that slithered throughout the whole storyline worse than the Goo weasling it's way into my base. I love it that the Silence was never defined in this, the mystery made it more impactful, more of a deadly and malicious enemy. My two favorite scenes was when Singleton gets to see the spreading Silence from the Goo's view, and also the ending credits with that dark curtian creeping closer and closer to Eco system #9? Wow, devs, very nicely done! Looking forward to the continuation of the story.Recommend if you enjoy story line along with some action stragety. Not Recommended if you're looking for another Starcraft with complex units and tech trees.			"

												One of the games that was at PAX South 2015 that I was really excited to know more about was Grey Goo. Unlike with other RTS games where strategy is a one size fits all, Grey Goo gives you the freedom to play the game the way you want to play it. You have to spend time with it to learn what works for you and what doesn’t.30 Second Review+ Real Time Strategy (RTS) that is a Macro vs Micro experience+ 3 unique factions that are extremely diverse from one to the next+ Story driven CGI cutscenes that deliver– Default key bindings are poor but can be changed– Learning from trial and error can be frustratingClick the link to read the full review:http://everydaygamers.com/2015/02/23/review-grey-goo/ "

												A decent game, but the lack of anything higher than 2v2 (such as 3v3 or 4v4) hinders the experience and makes it quite hardcore (whitch is fine but I believe this emphasis on intensity over fun had most of the players leaving) in fact I was playing on easy and despite my rts experience couldnt beat the 3rd level in single player. So single player is tough, multiplayer most ppl have jumped ship already. Only buy if you know those two factors to be fact and you don't care.			"

												The game does indeed give the early c&c vibe. It looks and plays rather smoothly, except the occasional random framedrop, usually when there are many units on the screen moving/fighting or many buildings explode at the same time (surrendering)It feels like there are some optimisation issues at the moment, but I dont think its anything that cant be patched. (EDIT: Tried many combinations of settings, from lowest to highest, it all laggs under the same circumstances, to the same degree regardless of graphics detail. At least, I couldnt spot any difference)It is really refreshing to see a well made RTS in this day and age, that plays so well, however I agree to the critics assessment of the units being a bit bland, and there not (yet?) being enough of them. I'd also add more choices for upgrades.Even as it is, I'll probably have close to as much fun with this gem as I had with the Red Alert series, especially if they add more content, extend the map editors capabilities (which is promised), and fix the few optimisation problems.I cannot comment on the campaign, because I hardly ever  play those, but I have watched the cutscenes while my friend played the campaign, and they are superb quality.TLDR: Well made classic style, fresh RTS with minor optimisation problems as of now. Big potential for updates/more content. It is lacking a bit of variety of units/upgrades atm. A+ quality cutscenes.			"

												FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Grey Goo is a triumphant return to the classic RTS format. If you enjoyed Command and Conquer back in the day or are looking for a slower paced RTS then you will find plenty to enjoy here. It is not perfect by any means, but hopefully Grey Goo will give the genre a much needed kick up the♥♥♥♥♥♥and we can get some more juicy RTS goodness in the near future.Grey Goo features: Three playable races, each with their own playstyle and strengths.An excellent keyboard shortcut system that makes building and recruitment a breeze A kick♥♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack and beautifully animated cinematics.Some people have been experiencing a few performance issues on heavily populated maps, and I have experienced severe frame rate drops in the ingame menus and mission briefings. I recommend checking the Steam forums for news on patches and hotfixes if this is a concern. But for the most part, a recent NVIDIA patch has solved most of the problems that I have been experiencing.More detail in the video below:

												Grey Goo is a fantastic RTS set in the far future and populated with a diverse set of characters and factions.  It also features  an incredibly interesting take on faction infrastructure and upgrading technology. To start, as of now there are four factions, the Beta, Humans, Goo, and Shroud.  The Beta use 'hubs' to create structures anywhere that they have vision, and can set up forward bases pretty much anywhere with relative ease.  Their units can also mount on wall pillars providing an additional defensive bonus.  The Humans on the other hand have a single massive base built using 'conduits' (think of roads) and can teleport any structure along the conduits for easier defence and more efficient use of the space that they have.  The Goo dont have any structures at all! Instead they have 'goo mothers' that roam around the map and use health as a means of production, splitting off pieces of themselves to create units.  The Shroud are relatively new to the game, and use amplifiers to increase the effectiveness of their buildings.  They also can 'evolve' their buildings for different purposes as the situation dictates.The story of GG is pretty well done and has an interesting twist at the end.  Mission Types are pretty diverse and let you understand the fundamentals of the major races before you set fourth in the multiplayer.  Also, the cinematics are GORGEOUS, honestly they beat out blizzard's own department in realism and quality.   Additionally, there is the 'emergence' mini-campeign that tells the story of one of the more significant characters after a certain event had happened.  The way technology works in GG is actually very novel.  Whenever you meet the requirements for an upgrade you can pick only one tech out of three.  Each upgrade is unique and you never really feel like you are losing when you do an upgrade, which in my mind is a pretty good achievement considering you are spurning other possibilities for the match.Despite the factional diversity each faction is pretty well balanced, and the team does a good job of putting out balance changes on the regular whenever an issue pops up.  The game had kind of a rocky release as well, but since that point and through the effort of Petroglyph the game keeps getting better and better with each content release and balance update.  The last update featured an ENTIRE FACTION FOR FREE.  That NEVER HAPPENS (at least what I've played) in RTS.  I have nothing but praise for Petroglyph.Honestly, if you like the ""90's style"" of RTS then you are doing yourself a disservice by not getting this game.  Personally its one of the best games I've played in a long time, and even with the release of XCOM 2 I can't seem to get away from this game.  It just has a special charm that will keep pulling you back in if you give it a try.TL:DR, If you like RTS in the ""90's style"", balanced gameplay (with diverse factions), great cinematics and rediculously committed developers, then buy this game.

												Very simplistic in many ways (low unit variation, few units) with a HORRIBLE Ai in singleplayer...seriously the Friendly Ai wont attack to help you and the enemies tend to stand 5 meters away with units peacefully while i reduce their base to ashes...I thought it would be a nice single player experience...its not. Nice upside are the short cutscences...thats it pretty much.Not to mention the oh so friggin tedious SLOOOOOW movment of units and gameplay...i mean im not a StarCraft pro or even newbie, but this slowpoke kind of management bored me to death inbetween engagements.Dont recommend it for the single player (not going to play multiplayer).

												As a huge fan of Age of Empires I had great expectations of this game, and they were met over and over again! This is a great RTS game and an amazing story line in the campaign! I cant get enough of the campagins story and they just added DLC expansion of the campaign which I am enjoying very much! Such a great game I am very happy with my purchase totally worth the price paid! If you like age of empires and are looking for a new twist on the same type of game you will enjoy this game. The multiplayer had a ruff start but they have since fixed this by having exclusive servers now and making an observer mode as well as replay ability. So I give the game 10 outta 10!			"

												Very much a high quality old-fashioned RTS with a blissfully modern interface and a really rare dedication to worldbuilding. The campaign reflects the basic gameplay properly and provides a genuine challenge and the cutscenes and voice acting are exotically good for an RTS game. The campaign does have a couple of strange difficulty spikes and a few things that could've been used more but I've enjoyed it more than pretty much any of the gimmick-laden stuff that has predominated in RTS campaigns since probably Age of Empires 3.  I've been dipping my toes in the multiplayer and think the blend of a more Total Annihilation production-style economy with the conventional RTS resource pools makes for some very interesting options and the way the factions balance against each other is quite interesting. Looking forwards to playing more.			"

												THE BOTTOM LINELets be straightforward, this is a good RTS game, it has great balance and lots of unique units. Each faction is signifigantly different, not just from the units and the type of gameplay. The soundtrack is fantastic, and the campaign is very nice how it tells out the story. This game feels a little like the first starcraft, because it feels special enough that I think this is a game that belongs in everyone's library. WHAT SHOULD BE IMPROVEDNow that is said, this game still needs improvement, it is a lot of fun, but the game feels like it is still missing something, there are just not enough units and buildings and feels like it is lacking depth. There are a very limited number of upgrades as well, which also adds to the feeling that the game is lacking in a little bit. That can be improved, and I really hope they keep releasing new content or even an expansion to the game, it could make it fantastic			"

												Bought Grey Goo because of word of mouth and screenshots. So an ""impulse buy"". So far, the story is great and I've had zero issues with multiplayer. The AI is pretty much a zerg rusher. While some people hate that, like myself, it also forces me to stop using typical tactics and adjust my tactics to counter. I have to plan a bit ahead and watch my resources and the map. You can't just turtle behind walls and wait. It is a bit refreshing and aggrivating. Beta - My favorite race. Fun to play, easy to expand bases(not as easy as the goo) and good units.Human - My least favorite race. I do not like their style at all. Some base expansions are almost impossible to do with this race(or I haven't figured out how to do an expansion without the conduit).Goo - Forget walls if you are playing against these guys. They go up and over anything(the goo form does, the unit form does not.) Do not let them get control of too many resources nodes or you will be dying fast.It's great that all three races are so different and require differing tactics. The campaign is a bit brutal, even on easy. So if you are looking for a piece of cake game then don't bother here. Three stories in one game. Maybe Blizzard should take notice with their Starcraft II story junk.			"

												This is the only RTS released in the past 1 year ? First one after Starcraft 2 DLC....Hard to compare it with anything as long as there is nothing else similar.The game is quite decent overall. Would play it again.Pro :- finally an RTS game ! ( steam says bejeweled is an RTS game .. )- factions are different and you will probably use different aproach to win- graphics are nice. Cinematics are well rendered..polished- has that awsome feeling that unless you manage to exploit the enemy AI you will probably restart the map. You need a good defense with a good trade ratio than an offense- units have positioning advantages : bush, siege, wall....- playing with Goo and having 10 mother goo is just funny to cap out unit count within seconds. Than the whole map moves...Neg :- collision box of units is quite large- when you order units to move, they push other units aside that will not move back to their place. Annoying as you want siege units to stay in the back at specific positions- enemy AI will wear you down unless you have a clear win strategy- at maxed out unit cap, my pc lags a bit			"

												The last Petroglyph RTS I played was Empire at War... or I should say, I STILL play it. It's an incredible game, and so I was glad to be able to try out their latest offering in the genre. Grey Goo is graphically impressive and intensive, and has some interesting features including 3 (4 with DLCs) very distinct factions. They have very independent play styles and technologies, e.g. the Goo are very offensively geared and need to secure a ton of resource points to build their army whereas the Beta are strongly defensively oriented with fortifiable walls. Humans and Beta can operate with relatively few resource points and protect them a lot better, plus have air units. However, literally every single Goo unit can be used in combat, including their 'bases' which are mobile. The graphics and sound (especially music) are very well done, though on older systems expect a bit of lag and long load times even on low quality. Aside from the 3 factions, you have a pretty typical RTS setup. There is one resource- catalyst- which is harvested from vents in the ground. There is research and upgrades. All sides have cheap infantry units, tanks, anti-air, and a 'super' unit that is ridiculously expensive, slow to build, and devastatingly powerful. The general rock-paper-scissors concept does apply. The main draw of Gray Goo is a pretty well-done campaign and the very different way the factions play. They are distinctive enough and interesting enough that it's fun trying them all out and getting good with them.			"

												This game is completely underrated. Unfortunately there are rarely if ever any custom steam matches to play on MP. But have a friend buy it also and you can have loads of fun together. The campaign is very solid also with the expansion. The audio and visual aspects of the game are equally stunning. For all the negative reviewers, all I can say is what were you expecting? Its very similar to C&C games on purpose. It's sort of a mix between C&C and Starcraft. There are four races, and each one is entirely unique in the way that units and structures are built, upgraded, etc. Similar to Starcraft in that sense but even moreso in my opinion. The only real complaint I have about this game is that there is basically no tutorial whatsoever, LOL. You have to learn by playing. I did notice under the Extras section of the menu it does have an encyclopedia which probably gives you more of an idea how to play with each race. A little too late now, but oh well. If you are not sure about this game but are an RTS and/or sci-fi fan, be it Starcraft, C&C, whatever, buy it. You wont regret it. I bought it for $9 on a Steam sale and it was WELL worth the money. I was really surprised to see the original price was only $39.99. The game is very well made and superbly polished. There are a good bit of cutom maps on the workshop too which adds to replayability. Also the AI is really good in my opinion. And the difficulty levels are ""Insane""!			"

												While SC and its ilk continue to dominate the RTS genre, there's space for CnC style games which emphasise strategy over clicks per minute. It's a very well produced game, and while 2 of the factions are a little similar the third adds a good deal of spice and gameplay dynamics we've not seen in RTS before. While Universe At War (Petroglyph's last RTS) was innovative and interesting, it suffered from GFWL and the baggage of a controller-based setup scheme (someone somehwere thought peasants should have an RTS). This isn't burdened by any such limitations, and is very obviously a PC game from the ground up. So - this is more macro strategy than micro management, and I think it's better for it. Don't for a minute assume there's no build orders, counters or clever tactics to be had here - there are plenty - you just don't need to (in fact, you can't) micromanage your resource collectors etc. for a 5% advantage over the other player. 8/10, 9/10 with rice.

			I check out Grey Goo from Petroglyph and Greybox! This awesome RTS game is veru similar to classic games and I'm enjoying every second of it even if I'm dreadful!		

When I first heard about Grey Goo I have to admit I was pretty hyped but was also a bit concerned as most RTS feel a bit lacking. I'm by no means a good RTS player but I do enjoy them and Grey Goo has seriously captured my love at the moment. I have not been able to put as much time into this game as I'd like but the time I've been able to spend with it so far has been a pleasure. The campaign is great with beautiful cutscenes and animated briefing before each mission really sell the world and fight to you. The gameplay and design is simply perfect to me. Easy to understand but difficult to truly master I've found. A great pick up for any RTS fan or someone looking to get into RTS games.			"

												An impeccably produced RTS that harks back to simpler days, there is a lot to like here for fans of RTS - but there is also a lot not to like.There are a number of issues with this game that whilst on their own wouldn't amount to much, taken together they really spoil what could otherwise have been a great game.Problems include -Sloppy click registration. At times the game will blissfully ignore a click or two at a critical juncture - whether this is because its cycling through a unit animation and can you please just wait a minute for me to finish, or whether at other times its just a fug of having to click something twice, overall the control can at times feel a little sloppy and sluggish. For an RTS that wants to turn the clock back this is something of a killer problem - good control feedback is a must for this kind of game.Frustrating / Unimaginative campaign play. Endless hordes of hordes. Again. And Again. And Again. Whilst the campaign cut scenes are absolutely top notch and the story is interesting, the actual level design is abysmal with the same idea spammed out endlessly. Not to mention a difficulty level that staggers wildly from tricky to insane, and some questionable tactical choices can make some levels a real turn off.Dodgy unit capabilities. The Flying hand of Ruk. Which has to navigate through doors. Because it can't fly over a wall. Or cliff. Or anything. On its own this is a trivial point. But when added to the sloppy control and poor level design just ends up making you want to repeatedly smash your head into a wall.And don't get me started on the tactical genius of the forest cover which hides units within. This is a great idea in theory. In practice against a spamming level design its a chore fest of sniffing units out, wiping them out, only 5 seconds later to have your scouts wiped out and the enemy grief sniping you all over again. Wise tactical decision ? Yes. Enjoyable gameplay ? Hell no.All of these problems pretty much sum up the game - love and effort has obviously gone into crafting this, but along the way they have made mistakes, cut a few clunky corners or made some just plain bad decisions which turns the final result into something of a flawed experience.If you can see past the flaws then this is a solid old school RTS game.If you can't then this game is a frustrating piece of meh - albeit with lovely production values.

												Interesting premise is ruined by pretty dull gameplay, where one and same tactic works in every level.Grey Goo as a term is an interesting end-of-the-world scenario, and lore in this game is interesting. Cutscenes are really well done. Campaign is divided into three different factions: Beta (an alien race, pretty similar to humans in technology and in appearance), humans, and the famous Grey Goo + one with the dlc that i haven't tried yet (read on to find out why).The last RTS that i've played was Age of Empires 2 HD, where every unit countered another. So when starting this, i somehow presumed this was pretty balanced as well. I lost many matches, always trying to improve my tactics, build more diverse army and position them correctly. In the end, you can win every level with the same unit type, and starting your economy the correct way. For example: I play the game on hard, finished the last mission of the human campaign in about 35 minutes (on the first try!), and few minutes of that was waiting my epic unit going to do the bonus objectives in the level, because he's so slow to move around :DAnother example: On a level where i had to evacuate civilians. I had a limit of 40 civilians that could die before i lose. 4 died in the entire level, and that was because i was too bored to build efficiently. This was also a first try of the level.If it wasn't for the lore/cutscenes, i wuold most likely stopped playing this game after a few levels. I haven't encountered any bugs, graphics are fine, the game runs stable 60fps. It's just that the gameplay itself is boring. No matter what's thrown at you, building the specific way (and you can build that way on every level) you will survive without much fight.I haven't played the multiplayer much at all. So i don't know how much there's people still playing this. If you get this as a part of a bundle, or in huge sale it's an ok game to play once for the cutscenes and lore.There's gameplay videos on my youtube channel if you wish to see. Some of them clearly show that i'm getting a bit bored :D

												I for one do not understand all of these bad reviews people. This is a GREAT GAME! The interaction with the environment is AMAZING! If you are in a forest no one can see you unless they are two. This is a great way to make a good and well based strategy. This is that same with the moutains no one can see what is on top of the moutains unless they have a plane above to show them what to shot at. These are just two things that are GREAT about this game. There is so much more and is a AMAZING and EXCELLENT RTS and strategy game! Worth the money!			"

												While this genre is now often called the grandpappy of MOBAs and Tower Defense games in this day and age, I'm still an avid fan of RTSs and Grey Goo does not disappoint! It takes many of the best elements from the C&C series and incorporates some progressive new ideas of it's own! - Single player is incredibly well polished, with great cutscenes, although the story itself leaves something to be desired. - The QWERTY hotkey-bar setup takes a little while to get used to but is generally much more user friendly than other RTS hotkey configurations like SC and AoE. - The foliage cover mechanic is a fun twist to traditional cloaking. - So far balancing between the three factions looks solid, but I haven't played that many multiplayer games yet so we'll have to wait and see if it still feels right after that. - I enjoy having the resource rate meter on the top right, like Supereme Commander and other games in that vein vs. just a straight up resource count. - The multiplayer games I've played with my friends so far have been action packed from the get-go. Even with 2 factions having walls, turtling doesn't seem to work as a valid strategy for too long. - The unit upgrades in the game are more strategic than, ""This just makes my units beefier,"" like SC2 where you pretty much have to get some upgrades without thinking too hard about them. - The Goo is probably the most unique faction I have EVER played in any RTS game. It will be a lot of fun to master! My only major gripe with this game is that the multiplayer scene looks a little scant so far. More people who love RTSs (of which there may not be many) please buy this game so I can play with yo'll!!! :D			"

												Many people expect C&C because the developers. but it is not.Grey goo much more like Total Annihilation than other RTSs.many TA-like style RTSs are sarcastic to ""Real-time Dotegy"".because the descendants of TA are puresured to be massive wargame. So, there was no options to control your armies. in result, the units are being little 'Dot'. Supreme Commander was it and Planetary Annihilation was it.Compare to the descendants of TA, Grey goo much more like original TA.  there is no extreme zooming but you will meet TA-like play style. massive production line, realtime resource absorbtion, macro management, auto harvesting resource, ETC...but that isn't mean Grey Goo has no Micro Management factor. it has. your fighters must be controlled by your hand to avoid AA-lines, track and destroy primal targets. Convering fire makes your army can defeat enemy forces in disadvantage. your slow bastion unit must be positioned in front of attack force, and more and more things to do.this game excellently combined Macro-Micro Managements. and it doesn't make your units to tiny point thing. this game is full filled by notable things.if you know how to play this game(and specific faction), it would assure a lot of fun. learn it!P.Sthere is Huge different between Feel and Knowledge. Before complain about balance, look and see replays(especially ranker's). this game provide replay download feature. you can download it from multiplayer menu.of course there is no perfect balace. but some people are complaining about balance without comprehension.

												Great game, which i only have on issue with. It's way too difficult on normal. as some others have said, you can barely get a base up before you're already overwhelmed, and it takes ages to get the base up to a standard where you can start producing enough units to fight with a chance. Besides that though, good graphics, great CGI, story okayish. Recommend buying in a sale for sure.			"

												Game reminds me more of Starcraft than Red Alert series.But hey, I don't mind, Grey Goo I would say is one of the best RTS games released in the past decade.If there were more RTS games that were coming out which weren't absolutely a complete waste of time, then I should think Grey Goo might still be up there on my top five list. Because it's really sublime. Good soundtrack, good gameplay, all the modern conveniences of a modern RTS (which I appreciate).Ordering your units around just feels smooth. Unlike some other games, Grey Goo just feels uncluttered and simplistic. I love it. The shortcut keys to quick select units and buildings makes one feel like a pianist, and I love that too. I also like that, it seems to me, the tips on the loading screens are actually useful for once. And that's awesome.The Grey Goo faction is also pretty neat.Also, I can't stop saying Grey Goo for some reason. It's a name that really rolls off the tongue. Bonus points for that.In short, it's an RTS. You like RTS? Get this game. If not? Don't bother. I mean, obviously don't bother, you'll never have fun if it's not your thing. But yeah. Game is good.

												This is a VERY well-polished RTS!  If you bought it for $60, you did not waste your money.  Grey Goo is on par with StarCraft.  Its races are well-balanced, the gameplay is smooth, the AI can be challenging (if you want it to be, if not the lower difficulty leves are very forgiving), the tech trees are well thought out, and the single player story is decent for a RTS game.  The races manage to be similar to each other, yet different enough that you will be using different strategies with each.  The most wildly different race being the game's namesake, the Grey Goo itself.  This alien sludge is as wierd and innovative an RTS faction as they get.  You don't build any buildings, you just roll a blob over enemies and resources, get massive, and spawn stuff.  It's like The Blob from the old scifi horror movie, only it can turn itself into alien machines.  It's the sort of thing you'd expect to see on an episode of Stargate SG1.If you're an RTS buff, I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Grey Goo is, first and foremost, not Starcraft. If you like the modern Starcraft-esque RTS that's fast paced, micro intensive, and largely based on twitch skill and on-the-fly adaptation mixed with scouting and mastery of build order, this may not be the game for you. Grey Goo is slow, deliberate, and methodical. The organization of your forces going into an engagement is going to be much more important than what you do in the middle of the fight, and for most of the factions, all of your production is going to be very, very centralized, leading to longer games that focus on large-scale battles. Grey Goo as an RTS is far more focused on the large-scale strategy to the small-scale tactics, and it can be jarring for a lot of people if they're familiar with more micro-intensive games.The Good:- Large faction diversity. Basic units are present in each faction, but infrastructure needs vary drastically and while the same general roles are filled by each class and their units (Light tank, light damage, heavy tank, heavy damage, artillery, seige, scout, air, etc.), how each race goes about those basic goals has enough variety to make playing each faction quite different, especially the unorthodox Goo of the title.- Streamlined economy and tech management. Only the one resource to worry about, and tech, despite generally requiring certain buildings be built, isn't linked to them intrisically.- Excellent UI and menu design. Once you get used to it, the hotkeys for building are incredibly intuitive, allowing for easier base management without having to set your infrastructure to 4-5 hotkeys just by themselves.The Bad:- A very slow game. The standard win-condition requires you destroy the enemy core, all of their factories, and all of their refineries. Even if they literally could not possibly recover, you've gotta whittle away their buildings if they don't feel like surrendering. Which the AI doesn't so practicing against the AI is going to be a bit of a long process.- Buildings are very tanky and supply lines are difficult to disrupt early game, which makes harassment a non-viable option. Early-game can feel very same-y as you scout out the enemy and try and build your forces to counter theirs. The exception to this is the Goo, which...- The Goo, despite being really cool and unique, are incredibly weak one-on-one. They're the only faction vulnerable to harassment because their health is their resource, and because they gain resources so slow early on, it's very, very easy for them to fall into a death spiral, especially on small maps.

												An Exellent RTS game that take's many of the features of older strategy games, and gives to them fresh graphics and an interesting storyline.With four unique faction, each with an interesting playstyle this game has plenty of gameplay that relies a lot on unit placement and range's for your tactics, forgoing activated unit abilities and support powers that many other strategy games have.With a large and intriguing campaign that has missions for three of the factions (the fourth was put into the game later) you will learn how to control each faction as well as learn about the history of the Grey Goo and how it relates to the other factions.Though each of the factions is fun to play they all have only a limited number of units, thus limiting the potential tactics useable. With unlimited resourses on the ground you can take your time and push forword at your own pace to victory.One slight negitive is that each faction has an epic unit, which while fun to use the only real way to kill one is with another epic. This means that all of your other units will do you no real good against one thus further limiting your tactics.All in all Grey Goo is a fun Rts that will make you loos track of time with its awesome campaign and great factions for your tactical enjoyment.

												Worst title ever?  I honestly avoided the game for a long time because the name is so inane, I wonder how many others have as well.That said, the game is remarkable in some ways.  You can see the visuals are quite good, and you can read the reviews about the balanced gameplay... I'm only playing single at this point (rarely have time for multi), but there's an aspect people aren't mentioning, or are disparaging: the story.The story is NOT presented well.  It's weird and seems quite common, and throws you into a campaign of being this weird alien race with S. African accents - is this District Nine??  But it gets better - much better.  Once you get around to the human campaign, you start to get more of a feel for context and some kind of linear story, but it's not until you get to the ""goo"" campaign that you get real depth and some immersion at last.  The story is really quite good, but the telling of it falters quite a bit, letting itself down.  The voice acting and animation are all great, so I think if you stick with it you'll be happy by the end - but if you're like me, you might not make it past the opening missions that just throw you into the fray with no context.

That day is here in the form of Grey Goo. Grey Goo is a real-time strategy (RTS) game that combines classic strategy mechanics and a balanced combat system with an emphasis on large-scale decision-making. It puts you at the center of a tactical struggle for survival—and ultimately, control of Ecosystem 9.  Command one of three unique factions: the Humans, masters of defensive architecture; the Beta, a proud, versatile alien race; or the Goo, an enigmatic, highly mobile life form. Fight from behind massive walls, attack from strategic outposts, or swallow your enemies whole. Just remember, the choices you make on the battlefield will mean the difference between glorious victory and agonizing defeat. - Very Highly Recommended! "

												Alright, so Greygoo is an RTS game that takes place on a distant world where three races duke it out in all the sci-fi glory you could want. First, there are the humans who have an interesting way of base building where you are tied into building power grids to extend your base. It's an interesting take on base building while the other base building race, the Beta are set up like Halo Wars take on base building, you only have four points to build on from your HQ. After that you have to call in extra hubs to start new bases. There walls can also be mounted by various units for added defense! Next comes the 'revolutionary' Goo race that has no base building to speak of at all. As mentioned the Goo have no buildings at all, instead they have Goo Mothers which are essentially mobile HQ units that spit out goo units while they also have the ability to consume any hapless enemy units that get to close! Got the basics of what's going on here? Good.Now this game is supposed to lure you in with the tantalizing idea of facing this Goo enemy that eats units and can cross over any terrain for the most part. Sounds exciting right? Well, not quite. I'll get to that later, first the good!Pros-High level of detail in maps-Professional looking cinematics-Good Voice acting (Always adds a nice touch in any game! Mostly. Eh)-Sharp looking units-Soundtrack (Very inspiring)-The goo! Cons-Bad AI pathing-Bad campaign AI-Invisible walls-The goo!(Who would of thought?)-Campaign leaves you on a cliffhanger(Alright so its not a real con, *shrug*)The campaing is something to be lauded, at first anyhow. The campaign consists of 15 missions in all, and interestingly enough you get to play as every race during the campaign! The first five missions you play as the Beta, the mid part of the game finds you playing as the Humans, and for the final five missions you are the insidious, ravenous Goo!(Ahhhhhhh!).The Beta missions are fun and are a nice introduction to the game mechanics, the game shines in these early missions as you plod through lush rainforests in defense of your home planet from these mysterious invaders in shiny vehicles. (Hint: They are not the Goo). The game runs fine until you run into Goo, the goo do change the gameplay and that's interesting. Truly it is. But it turned out to be a bit of a let down in all honesty. (Heres looking at you 'The Trench' and 'Crash site') I expected the goo to come in waves, to come tearing into my base and just start munching everything. It didn't to my dissapointment. As it turns out the Goo is very much like the other races in terms of units. One thing I noticed, especially on the Crash Site is how annoying it is to hunt down the Goo for good cause you always seem to miss one of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Goo mothers somehow, and then you have to chase that one across the map, it's not really a challenge, it's a test of patience really. I had some fear for the rest of the campaign missions that this would be a recurring theme. Mission: Crash site tips!-If you initial base is shot to hell, rush to build a repair pad, when you get the second Hand of Ruk bring it to your base and begin a fun process. Have one of your hands of ruk hunting goo mothers whilet the other gaurds your base and heals from the repair pad. RInse and repeat.-Drop refineries on any resource veins you uncover! You can actually wall off half the map and man the walls, thus funneling the goo out into the open where it is easily defeated. Unorthodox? Maybe, but it works!From the Beta campaign the game throws you into the Human side of the conflict where you and your robot allies seek to protect yourselves on two front's as the war heats up. The human's way of base building where you are tied into this sort of expanding grid system is a bit weird. Worse, if the grid is destroyed any buildings tied into it at that particular spot and beyond it go dead. I enjoy how you can spam artillery and turrets and basically turn the game into a tower defense game in most missions. The human missions are also where you run into some annoying and or game breaking moments. Theres a campaign mission called 'The Observatory' that finds you facing down three Beta commanders at once in what promises to be an epic battle where you face overwhelming odds to save one of your only other human friends who survived the crash. I discovered something that kinda made the whole mission a cake walk.......Mission: The Observatory tips!-Build your defenses up at the elft entrance to your base, put up walls, spam turrets and artillery. -Rush for invisibility tech for 'Dagger' units. -Spam Dagger units while building up right side of base with plenty of artillery and anti air.-Send Daggers to every enemy base.-WIn.-(Sigh in dissapointment of how easy it was)Theres a theme here with invisible units, I promise. For some reason the AI cannot or refuses to build detector units in this mission. I won by blasting each base to bits with twenty something invisible daggers as the AI units stood there and let themselves get shot up. I Blew up the air base the same way. I then rushed the last base and blew it up too....using invisible Daggers. Note: This was on hard difficulty too.The next mission that manages to be a bother is 'The Terminal'. You and an AI commander from the Beta team up to take down the Goo! Yeah! Kick♥♥♥♥♥ It actually turns into a pseudo tower defense game sprinkled with 'Defend your useless Ally as the Goo munches everything'. True story ahead here folks, my Ally in this mission came under attack by the Goo and even though I helped them fend off the Goo attack my Ally AI never built another unit for the rest of the game. Even though they still had refineries and factories......The goo in this particular mission sends out it's epic unit, 'The purger' or as I like to call the 'deer in headlights'. The Goos purger ended up finding my allies base and started attacking it, I thought the mission was over since the Purger could wipe out his base as the hapless units he did have showed no sign of moving to engage this new threat. Luckily for us both the Purger stayed right beneath his base beside the cliff top and only attacked his outlying buildings. The purger actually destroyed his outlier buildings and then instead of pushing fowards it stayed right where it was and didn't move. Taking advantage of this stupified Purger, I preceded to bomb it to smitherenes with impunity. The purger never moved a muscle as I bombed it to death. ...On the flipside you do get to build the Human's epic unit! It is as glorious as it is shown in the cinematic trailer if your wondering. Another interesting thing that happened is that the Goo's units got stuck in corners and on cliffs and even units out in the open suddenly stopped moving and stayed still for the rest of the game. Perhaps they knew I was coming for them eh? A scared Goo enemy is a dead Goo enemy, or a sign of something wrong with the AI.... For the rest of that mission I preceded to chase goo around the map and eventually ended up hitting my unit cap as I patrolled every resource point and cornered the Goo. After bombing it to death the day was one! But was I having fun? Eh.... GreyGoo promised epic battles with this new mysterous race called the GreyGoo, it was going to be terrifying, insidious, and oddly enough not very grey,(More blackish??? Further data needed.) But instead I found myself dissapointed by the Goo and only kept playing the Campaign to see how the epic struggle between the three races would end. I'm not going to talk about the Goo campaing much because that's where the game falls apart. Two words: Invisible walls. Take a look at my pics of the game if you don't believe me folks. You can beat all the hard missions with invisible walls of Radiants. You can beat the last mission by rushing from the start... GreyGoo, a revolution unrealized.  :(			"

												Pros: Fun, if very short campaign, very visually pleasing. Awesome soundtrack.Cons: Holy balance batman! Limited amount of players in general, you tend to queue against the top 40 players int he world any day of the week. The maps are very awkward, as some are very imbalanced toward a certain race or another due to catalyst placement(basic resource). Strategy is lost when each races tier 1 units are basically the best unit due to the ability to mass them in small tight knit groups that have one or two counters that are lackluster when you cant get in range.IE: Drovers usually deal with Stalkers well, but if you have 40 stalkers, the drovers cant even get into range to start aoeing down the striders, basically body blocking. Pathing is wierd, hitboxes are weird when trying to move units around, they just slide about like they are all in a hockey rink.Basic armor needs to be looked at.  Walls from both beta and human need to be looked at, as 1000 hp is really silly considering the low cost and its no-effort utility.There is a very limited variety of units on each race, and even less upgrades, you basically get 5 total for your entire race. And once you upgrade one you cannot upgrade two others. At all.Goo is very strong at early harassment as long as they are not harassed themselves.Pro games where the goo player gets found before the minute mark almost always end in the goo players defeat, since they rely so much on their production/main unit the Mother Goo. She clocks in at an amazing 6 feet/hour.Humans are locked into this ugly power conduit design that honestly is just terrible. I'm not sure how much cocaine was consumed during the development to think that anyone would enjoy never expanding and dealing with insanely small amounts of space to even build in. This is even WORSE on certain maps that have very tiny starting placements.Basically the only race that feels even close to fun to play is Beta, at least they can expand and actually maintain map control rather than watching your units slowly travel across the entire map because thats where your factories are stuck.This will never grow, and probably never see any esport coverage. Funny enough since there is a tiny little playerbase, I was able to play most of the top 10 players(and getting owned by them) from the day I got the game. I enjoyed it while it lasted, but seeing no new players and the complete silence from the devs make this game a dead end. I shouldn't of listened to the circlejerk and passed this one by. Sadly, since I gave it a chance I'm out of the time period for a refund.  6/10.			"

On max setting I had no slowdown effect even with max unit battles going on. But I exceed the Recomended setup by a fair bit. (Skylake i7 6700k, 16gb RAM, 4gb GeForce GTX 970).This game has resurrected the RTS Genre which died in the last decade.Cant wait for the sequel.			"

												Riddled with problems, not the best RTS around. Other reviews have already covered the main ones - similar factions, lack of unit abilities, odd and univesting story, balance issues here and there. With the price drop, however and with the deal you get out of the Definitive Edition, it is actually quite worth it. It is far from bad, but it was nowhere near the price asked - the drop was already enough to justify a recommendation.However, another bit of good news to consider is the Shroud, the fourth faction. In short, they are an example of Petroglyph finally realizing the issues their game has. Having a fourth faction already fixes a significant amount of issues with the game, having two rather similar non-Goo factions for one. However, they are also clearly different without being... weird like the Goo. They are, gasp, a decent RTS faction, which it seemed Petroglyph had forgotten how to make. That you get them with the Definitive Edition is already good, but another point in Petro's favor is that previous owner get it for free. For a game that underperformed as this one did, it's reassuring to see bold decisions such as this massive price drop and non-half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥DLC. Sure, it's because they're desperate, but they didn't give up, and they went on to make it far more consumer-friendly.As for the other elements of the DE - Emergence is not an improvement on the shrug-inducing original campaign, actually, it's worse. The OST is now fully worth it (Frank Klepacki, if not at his most metal)  because they fixed it because they somehow broke the OST for close to a year. The Shroud is the best thing to happen with the game so far, it really elevated my own opinion on the game. You do as you will, but the new price makes it worth it for any RTS enthusiast.			"

												Would I recommend this? Yes. On one condition: when it is on sale.Why the condition? Well I'll get to that...The good:- The title faction, the Grey Goo, is the most interesting faction I've played for years in an RTS. The unit designs are simple but appealing and the faction's overall design philosophy is as far as I know unique. It has several units that are truly distinct, there are no counterparts in the other faction's armies.- The presentation in this game is lovely. The Goo, as mentioned above, are stellar standouts but the rest is still very competant.- The cutscenes are beautiful. I really wasn't expecting them. Iirc there is a cutscene in between every mission, all of them quality CG (as opposed to in-engine) ((Not that there is anything wrong with in-engine, but this is damn good CG work))- Music is pretty competant, I believe Frank Klepacki (of C&C fame, among others) is involved. Nothing as stand out as Hell March but there are a few tracks that caught in my mind.The grey:- The game does not have a long campaign. There are 3 factions, 15 missions overall meaning 5 missions apiece. You'll play your first 5 missions as the Beta, an unremarkable faction whose only saving grace is awesome accents. The second 5 as the Humans who use drones built by Apple. The third 5 as the Goo, who are awesome. Your mileage may vary depending on your buying price, interest and patience. I'll get back to this one...- Most units from all factions fall into specific roles with little deviation. For the most part each faction will have 3 light units and 3 heavy units. 2 factions also have 3 aircraft, scouts, fighters and bombers. The Goo outshines the other factions here because of it's different approach but still has the light/heavy formula weighing it down somewhat.- Some of the unit designs are so generic as to be boring to look at and boring to use.- I'm not particularly versed in balancing, I don't know all of what goes into balancing decisions. Bearing that in mind, I found one or two of the Goo's units underpowered. Actually all of their heavy units, as cool as they are, seemed to be flawed. The heavy tank seemed fragile and the artillery seemed weak even in massed groups. The bad:- The Goo has a unique unit with no attack whose sole purposes are to block line of sight and taunt enemies. It's a great concept. The trouble is they are slow and when moving a mass of units they are not always in the front line when needed and unit pathing/collision would not allow them to move. Good, predictive micro helps this somewhat.- Let me phrase that last point another way, units of the faction whose army is made up of puddles of nanobots grouped in certain formations cannot move past each other. Conceptually they should be able to flow around each other. Gameplay wise, there is an upgrade to let the above unit start a rampage when critically damaged. A far better upgrade would be to have them charge enemy units. A missed opportunity.- The AI is not the best. This works both for and against you. Enemy units will sometimes not retaliate to your attacks. Your units will not retaliate while a nearby enemy attacks them. This is unrelated to the gameplay of stealth units and units in bushes.- Unique to the Goo, every once in a while you will find your Mother Goos (the mobile HQ/factory/so much more of the faction) randomly moving. You will not have told them to do so, will not have had them even selected. But they will move. And you will curse.Now the crux of the matter, why the condition? If you've looked this far, you know why you want to play 'Grey Goo'. You want to play the Grey Goo. The other factions aren't anything remarkable. You've seen the Goo and thought you'd like to get your hands on them. You're also probably not new to RTS games, you know that you only get the good stuff, the 'cool faction' at the end. You're right: the Goo is the third campaign. You're going to have to sit through 2/3rds of the game to get to the part you actually want to play. The positive is that each faction has only 5 missions so it won't take that long to reach the 'Good' bit. The conditional 'Yes' recommendation hinges on the fact that on sale, this isn't too big of a pill to swallow. But at full price? You're paying £30 or the equivalent in the knowledge that £20 is a chore you have to get over to get to the fun.Now this is all subjective, my opinion only. I didn't even mind playing as the Humans as much as I thought I would. The Beta are terrible in their blandness though. But I can only think back to my thought process as I played through: 'Get this first bit over and done with and then the fun starts'.			"

												I haven't got words for this game. It is good, but yet still bad at the same time. It's an okay game, i enjoy playing it. But I feel as if there's something missing or unfinished about it. Maybe its the limited units or there's no powers, etc. like other RTS games, such as Command and Conquer. The cinematics of this game was very beautiful though and what made me play the campaign. It can get boring playing only skirmish, but i can see having friends that own this too, it would be good for something like a LAN. With the right updates or DLC this could be my new RTS to play.Pro's:- Great soundtrack and cinematics- Pretty decent balanced on each faction- Map and sizes aren't too small or too big- Each factions has an Epic unit (similar to C&C3: Kane's Wrath)Con's:- Feels limited on units and upgrades- No factions powersIf you enjoy RTS games, this is a definite buy for your library!

												Grey Goo developed by Petroglyph and released to the PC on Jan 23 2015. On Metacritic (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/grey-goo) it has:A score of 77 with an average user score of 7.6#99 Best PC Game of 2015 #48 Most Discussed PC Game of 2015 If you have ever heard of Westwood studios (makers of C&C and Red Alert) you'd probably played their games before. Ahh, so many sweet memories with the games made by Westwood studious notably Red Alert. My first PC game. My first love. Until EA ruined it. Lol. Can you expect the same game experience in Grey Goo? Probably and I'd dare say this for the record. This is definitely the right step going forward and there is a huge potential for this product/the universe which Petroglyph has created. Not many RTS games can match up with Blizzard's Warcraft/Starcraft standard(s). With Grey Goo, as weird as the name sounds, it's actually pretty good (with some issues).The StoryGrey Goo (GG) is set in the distant future where 3 factions are at war; The humans, The Beta, The Goo and the final battle leading up to another faction? Supposingly to be the greater evil which the Goo is trying to protect everyone from? Sounds confused? Yup. It's a sticky situation. VisualsThe visuals are good. It's hard to explain how good something looks like lol but it's really good. Think of something like Starcraft 2. Each faction unit and base has been designed distinctly. Each faction has a different “ultimate” unit. Each video briefing presented before a mission is beautiful to look at. The characters, their clothing, the background. Job well done there.I have no complaints on how good the visuals are in fact, I was actually surprised that the devs decided to go with this beautiful game engine. Red Alert and C&C wasn't about graphics, it was about game play experience so kudos to the entire team for giving us this visual appealing product. ( and Audio dept team too =p )The ControlsControls are very important when it comes to RTS game as you will be constantly joggling tasks and observing different areas at different times. Dota style. Micro management. It's a good thing the controls are not broken in GG however they are very different. It's hard to use the key binding but maybe thats just me.This is related to the base building design/system. In starcraft, things are straight forward and you know what you want. In GG, a building has “attachment” which enables you to build other buildings to it. And depending on the building you build, you also have a skill menu that you can research or cancel it to pick another research. It takes a while to get a hang on the base building controls and it takes even more time to get a hang on the goo faction because there is no base mgt at all. My personal thoughts:GG has left a very strong impression on me. The campaign was good and challenging. The in-game bonus objectives can either enhance your game play experience or ruin it completely as some of these can be tricky to get. The Units were designed very uniquely across all factions and players can research skills that “alters” the units purpose in game. I like this system but it can be very overwhelming when in massive fights. Micro management gone haywire. It would be great if the UI can be improved to show unit building and skill menu separately. Yes, I want more. Missions should be expanded to troop level just like in Red Alert where we have infiltration levels; spy, submarine, or breaking into a base to save your comrade – anything aside from blowing up your enemies to kingdom kong.  I am expecting the Story/Writing to be more interesting for future titles. War/StarCraft has always been very interesting because of it's story. You fight for survival and then each faction has its drama..and then theres Jim Raynor with Sarah kerringan and the zerg..yeah I think GG lacks drama. I want some drama. Lol. It's the “drama” that pushes us on – to find out what actually happens.That push was not here for me. Bla bla bla. Kill this. Boom. Done. Kill that. Done. Kill everything. Done. Whats next? Killl the..-Stop. Ok. I get it. Just kill.-Just having a video to “usher” your audience to the next level is one thing. Having your audience to fight for a reason/fight for certain characters in game which they like/favor is another thing. That's something I hope to see. There's a glaring issue especially when it comes to base expansion. Unless you are a Beta/Goo, the humans will have a nightmare time when expanding their base from one end of the map to the other. I hope the devs can introduce new unit that helps with base expansion. Pity the humans (Lucy) =p My Summary:Overall, GG feels really good. It is very different. It is unlike any traditional RTS due to the unit & base design. Short on the story side but not bad. Missions could use some some variations. Combat is fun. *drums roll* So, on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Grey Goo is a of 7/10. ps: If saruk, Lucy and Simpleton can sit on the hand of ruk, i'd give it an 8! xD			"

												For all the players who want to taste an old school RTS like Emperor Battle for Dune or Command and Conquer, Grey Goo is a must. The game is not so long in history mode but with the bonus goals and the hard difficulty level then I assure you that you will spent some good hours playing. The last time I played a RTS in multiplayer mode was Starcraft 1 a lot of years ago and I started again with this game.

It simplifies a few annoying things about Starcraft without taking away any control. I like how you can rebuild extractors very quickly so it isn't too devastating to destroy them. You actually have to control ground on the map instead of just running around the map doing hit and runs on buildings.I really hope the community grows so that the queue times are faster for 2v2 ranked.

It has been far too long since the last RTS hit the shelves. now there are a few things i really enjoyed about it, The Campaign was fun every mission started and ended with a sweet CGI Scene. i like the factions in general that all have a fairly different playstyle and feel to em, the Maps all looked alien and intresting, with a silly alien Moose standing attop some cliffs moosing it up, The AI felt Fairly Challenging,and there are EPIC units as the game calls it they added allot to the game itself albeit abit overpowered every faction has one and it is fun to see two epic Units Duke it out whilst that Alien Moose is Moosing it up.Also on a SideNote The Ui is wonderfull.it felt very polished and its a good title in general it felt like a fun C&C experience. Just forget that last C&C but we dont even count that one do we now.9/10 Boosh.			"

												It's very fun.  All 3 races core base mechanics are more unique than any game I've seen (even more than Starcraft, but it's close).  At the same time, it seems like the humans base is at a distinct dissadvantage without being able to expand and having power deficiency weeknesses.  However, they do have ways around this (such as steath miners and ability to mine any distance from their base).  I think they need a more durrable power grid (called conduit crosses), and the ability to expand, even if the expansions can't be as complete.  You can mitigate this shortcoming with redundancy in your grid lines, which I feel is great... but they just seem a little vulnerable still.  This is without enough play for you to put too much stock in, but it's my first impressions.  A lot of the unblalanced things in the game that feel to weak initially, are actually stronger than they seem once you figure out how they really work.  The single player campaign is short, sweet, and too the point, teaching you the game in the perfect number of missions quickly, but not overwhelmingly.  I really hope they keep expanding on this series with finer polish (and a little lighter on the system requirements).  But if you give it a try, beware that your initial impressions may betray you because of the unconventional mechanics which are rewarding with a small invenstment (of just about 3-4 games) in learning them.

Each of the three races feel very unique.

												I've been a longtime Starcraft fan so I was a little suspicious of this game when I first got it. I'd tried a few other sci-fi RTS games in the past and none of them held my attention for long... boy was I in for a surprise!Grey Goo is one of the most creative and beautifully animated games I've played in a long time! The cutscenes and pre-mission briefings almost look real when I'm watching them, the audio is damn near perfect, and the gameplay is fast enough to keep up a good pace, but also encourages thoughtful preparation and decision making.So, lets go down the list of races first, as is always important with an RTS game:The Beta: A race of four armed humanoid aliens who have been on the run from something they refer to as ""The Silent Ones"" for generations. They're a sort of warrior race by necessity, having to constantly worry about their adversaries catching up to them as they're the last of their species. All three races get an 'Epic' unit, one that can be built by combining several buildings and spending a lot of resources. Their epic unit is the Hand of Aruk, a mobile weapons platform with a cannon that launches missles for massive explosive damage. Its slow and the cannon takes a while to recharge, but all around the cannon are little slots where you can have your other units ride ontop of the platform to add firepower to it. Outfit it with a few tanks and you've got a holy terror for your enemies to deal with.The Humans: Oddly enough WE'RE the super-advanced race this time around! Humanity went the Star Trek route in Grey Goo, becoming a spacefaring colonization race. As war has been rendered unnecessary for centuries all the human units are rather weak drone-robots that were mostly used to deal with aggressive wildlife on various planets. Infact, the leader of this expedition is one of the only two actual humans in the game! The other two units are a humanoid robot and a relic from the last war humanity ever had and MUM, their main computer. The Human's epic unit is Alpha and, well, this is also probably a relic from said war. Lemme put it this way: remember Power Rangers? Well you get your own space-age megazord!The Goo: This is the game's namesake and while it sounds silly its actually one of the most creative things I've seen in a while. The goo is a giant amoeba-like mass of nanomachines that can split itself off into smaller units which then morph into the more traditional units. While in amoeba form it can climb up walls and literally EAT buildings and enemy units, consuming them to heal itself and give you resources to make more units! At time of writing I haven't gotten to their epic unit yet, but I'm definitely intrigued to see how this all ends.There's one more species, but it's in the DLC expansion and I haven't played it yet. Its called the Shroud and is apparently the ""Silent Ones"" that were hunting the Beta.As for the game overall:What I liked:- Some of the most creative species concepts I've seen since I first played the original Starcraft.- Gorgeous animation, I can't believe this is an indie game!- Gameplay that encourages a thoughtful approach to enemies rather than the ol' standby of the 'zerg rush'.What I'm meh about:- The controls can be a bit awkward at first since all the units that you can build are tied to the keyboard in the menu, making it easy to select something by mistake.What I didn't like:- A couple of the missions can be pretty frustrating. I had to repeat one of the human ones several times when you're trying to find a downed spaceship and if the opponent finds it first it gets blown to bits within a few seconds, causing the mission to fail.Overall: With Blizz winding down Starcraft this is a definite way to scratch the RTS itch. I wholeheartedly recommend buying this game!			"

												Grey Goo is basically an older style macro-focused RTS. If you're used to playing APM-fests like starcraft 2, this will feel slow to you.Grey Goo is pretty nice though. I have played and enjoyed many different types of RTS games, but I always wanted to see a newer game in the vein of Tiberian Sun, and this game reminds me a lot of Tiberian Sun. The graphics are really nice, in-game the 3 different faction units all are tied together thematically. Humans having a smooth plastic-like design with lasers and energy weapons, the Beta more industrial and metallic with cannons and machine guns. The goo is pretty much what you would expect, all their units resemble different shapes of shimmering metallic liquid.The human and beta races play fairly similarly, the goo however plays entirely different as there are no goo buildings, everything the goo can make is a movable unit.There are essentially no mico-abilities on units, so the micro in this game is limited to positioning and targeting. I would say this game is very close to being a perfect successor to the westwood RTS games, if anything the game feels like a cross between tiberian sun and starcraft. Base building isn't as good as it was in tiberian sun, but it's far more interesting than in starcraft 2.Grey Goo also happens to be on a short list of RTS games that have had a really cool single player story. The animated cutscenes in this game are top notch. As much as I like Grey Goo, it really doesn't add anything new to the RTS genre other than a cool concept and story. In terms of gameplay it's less demanding than starcraft 2, but not as full of content as tiberian sun. As well made as it is, it will likely not blow you away, but it is certainly a fun game.			"

												I recommend trying the game out if you enjoy old RTS games like Command and Conquer. Pros:+fun campaign (although would have liked a longer campaign, only 5 missions for each of the three sides)+cut sceneslook great+good music+goo race is uniqueCons:-bugs, had a couple missions/skirmishes where AI did nothing-doesn't seem to be many still playing multiplayer (wasn't able to find a match)If you're looking for a quick fun RTS then this is worth a try.

												It's very fun.  All 3 races core base mechanics are more unique than any game I've seen (even more than Starcraft, but it's close).  At the same time, it seems like the humans base is at a distinct dissadvantage without being able to expand and having power deficiency weeknesses.  However, they do have ways around this (such as steath miners and ability to mine any distance from their base).  I think they need a more durrable power grid (called conduit crosses), and the ability to expand, even if the expansions can't be as complete.  You can mitigate this shortcoming with redundancy in your grid lines, which I feel is great... but they just seem a little vulnerable still.  This is without enough play for you to put too much stock in, but it's my first impressions.  A lot of the unblalanced things in the game that feel to weak initially, are actually stronger than they seem once you figure out how they really work.  The single player campaign is short, sweet, and too the point, teaching you the game in the perfect number of missions quickly, but not overwhelmingly.  I really hope they keep expanding on this series with finer polish (and a little lighter on the system requirements).  But if you give it a try, beware that your initial impressions may betray you because of the unconventional mechanics which are rewarding with a small invenstment (of just about 3-4 games) in learning them.

												A throw back to old school RTS it is a well polished game that combines spirits from command & conquer and starcraft. Like most RTS the game offers three races to control and achieve victory with domination from one. The game is quite easy to learn but hard to master. Macro elements present in starcraft have very little meaning in GreyGoo which forces the user to rely more on strategy and resource management.Overall this is a game really worth having. It deserves big praise for not only making RTS approachable for new players, the game mechanics for a new playable race ""Goo"" is truely worth looking into.85/100			"

												I won't focus too much on the raw gameplay mechanics other than that I find them quite nice and while the amount of units is quite small (I'm not certain if they're considering on developing this aspect of the game further of it the game is ""complete"") I enjoyed Grey Goo as a very polished RTS experience. The base-building and unit-building might have been a bit more expansive with more units and buildings to select from, but otherwise I liked what the game had on offer gameplay-wise. Apart from the raw gameplay, I think the reason why I'm writing this at all is because I love the game's story, atmosphere, graphics and soundtrack so much. I admit, I'm not the most competitive RTS fan, but I can't get enough of listening to Frank Klepacki's (He's a big name when it comes to game composers, I believe) soundtrack for this game and contemplating the game's different factions and characters.I have probably spent 3-4x more time in listening to the soundtrack and thinking of the game world than I have playing the actual game. The humans in Grey Goo are so interesting with how, in Ecosystem 09 at least, the humans are small in numbers and one single human settlement is both managed and developed by a single human scientist. The graphics in Grey Goo are spectacular and head over heels above the graphics of the other RTS games I've played. In all honesty I'd like the idea of having the creative design in Grey Goo combined with a more ""sandboxable"" experience such as a city builder or a turn-based tactics game. The sci-fi lore, art design and soundtrack are just to good!  "

												Ok, Bear with me.ive played a lot of RTS video games. Command and conquer, all of them. warcraft, all of them. starcraft, all of them. ive played rts games left and right, basically any i can get my hands on. while some people might argue that this game in particular is too easy or too hard. too simple or much too complex...here is my understanding, after playing the first mission of the campaign on a two day free pass...this game, makes every other game, look like a fish with no scales no fins and no gills. yeah sure you can throw a game like halo wars or c&cgenerals out into the public, but it will eventually drown in its own failure.Grey goo is easily the most beautiful game i have ever seen, and im not talking about just graphics... aliens, with their own species, very rich background with three full races. amazing music, incredibly simple economic system, tutorial built into the campaign, not to mention the music or actual graphics...and i was on graphics setting 1 of like, 5.Im not too good at reviewing games, ive never made a game, i dont know the hundreds of hours poured into games, the grueling decisions of what to cut out and what to strive for. but in my experiance thus far, i can say this:1 this game rocks, ill be buying it for me and my brother.2 this game rocks, you should buy it too.3 if you dont buy it, i feel very bad for you, your making a party foul.i know a good game when i see it, and this game is like...the holy grail of games.99/1001 point lost because, nothings perfect, ill eventually find a flaw, and the name glorifies one of the teams. doesnt take away from the game though 10/10.also its the first game where theres no diffinitive bad guy, all three races are just trying to survive and grow. i cant wait for part 2!!

												The 3rd RTS to be released by Petroglyph, Grey Goo is honestly a weird title all matters considered. On one hand, this is the most traditional RTS Petroglyph has released to date. This definitely makes it seem like Grey Goo has fewer defining qualities than its predecessors: Empire at War and Universe at War. At their repsective glances, Empire at War had its Galactic Conquest structure, and Universe at War had a focus on Faction differentation arguably exceeding the likes of Starcraft (Whether it did so successfully is highly up to debate). Grey Goo has neither of these defining traits- its structure is completely traditional in both its campaign and skirmish gameplay (It doesn't even have a light version of Galactic Conquest like Universe at War tried to), and its factions are nowhere near as differentiated as Universe at War's were.Now this level of traditionalism is indeed a selling point for many, since outside of Grey Goo (and a few other isolated games like Starcraft 2, arguably Homeworld Remastered, and some indie titles here and there) there aren't really many RTSes coming out that do this structure anymore. So in theory some people will appreciate Grey Goo for that alone. But in brutal honesty, considering just the purely traditional RTS stuffings within Grey Goo- there are plenty of older RTS titles that fare better. Its not that Grey Goo does anything horribly, its traditional elements are solid overall. But everything it does traditionally has been done better and made more interesting by other RTS titles. Whether it be better optimization, better balance, more interesting traditional faction AI, more varied units, or more interesting campaigns, you're definitely better off with older RTS titles in that regard.But this isn't really fair to Grey Goo- because that's not considering the few truly unique things it does actually do underneath its traditional surface.And its all because of how much focus Petroglyph clearly put into the Goo's skirmish AI. Being a completely mobile faction, the Goo are able to use elevation to hide their unit-producing mother goos. The Goo AI knows how to do this. and is NOT predictable when doing it, It won't just leave the Mother Goo on the hill for a random amount of time- it will ACTIVELY wait if you have it surrounded. Or the AI will figure out where the gap in your LOS is and try to use it. Or if you get too close to its hill trying to surround it, the AI might just come down and absorb those units. The Goo's AI feels like some of the most dynamic AI we've gotten in an RTS for quite some time. Its certainly not perfect as it will make questionable movement and attack decisions in plenty of situations- but it remains a joy to play against.Its just a pity that most everything around the Goo AI is lackluster in comparison. Unlike the Goo's AI, the AI for the Beta and Human factions is a complete bore. They don't do anything you haven't seen done better by other traditional RTS AIs.It might not be much of a definiing trait to clasp onto- but overall the Goo Skirmish AI alone is arguably worth the price of admission to what would have otherwise been a competent, but rather stale RTS.

												""Grey Goo"" is beautifully produced, but ultimately disappointing.Let's start with the positives.This game has a grand setting and top-shelf art. The cinematics, though not having as much action as a Blizzard production, absolutely CAN compete with Blizzard in terms of character design and visual quality. My jaw also dropped for the Beta and Human mission briefings, as those often featured cinematically rendered and composited characters that were big and lifelike.And, of course, the realtime graphics look as good as you would expect.As a piece of art, this title stands up to the heavy hitters. I actually wish Grey Box would make a movie of this universe, because it seems like they have most of the necessary assets on hand, along with the general knowhow required. (Plus a story worth telling, naturally.)Another aspect that earns a hat-tip is how the different factions actually have separate identities. The Humans and Betas are ""external hardware"" cultures that aren't completely estranged, yet the Betas have a freeform ability to plonk down structures almost anywhere. Humans, on the other hand, require a connection to their central power grid, and this has real implications for how you relate to resourcing operations and general expansion. The Goo manages to feel very alien by having a completely different take on everything. For Goo, your HQ is your resource operation, and your factory, and also a weapon. Even in ""Starcraft,"" the Zerg distinctives don't go quite as far. This game does a great job at actually presenting the internal experience of a race that reproduces by fission, which is a feat that I will definitely applaud.Where ""Grey Goo"" doesn't manage to truly compete is technical execution. Mostly, it comes down to lots of little things that aren't quite up to scratch.To start with, the interface tries to ""up the game"" by being less ""contextually bound"" than what you would get in something like ""Starcraft."" Unit build information is almost always available, and that's nice, but the way you get around in the various panels isn't quite as smooth as you might like. I also found it strange that certain structure build commands aren't ""sticky."" That is, once you've built a structure, you drop out of the structure build command and go back to ""click to select."" On the one hand, this makes sense, because Grey Goo isn't really about building a giant swarm of buildings - but there are some times when it's clunky. For instance, a human player might want to build multiple sentinels (weapon towers) at a time, but there's no apparent way to do so. You either have to call up the right panel over and over, or hit the hotkey combo multiple times.As it turns out, having an interface rearrange itself based on your selection context (and what makes sense in that context) is a better choice.Another design choice that didn't quite pan out for me was how the ""tech-tree"" requirements are presented. If you can't build something yet, the prerequisites are mostly displayed as icons. This seems like a good idea in theory, but in practice, plenty of things (especially in the realm of building attachments) look pretty similar. What happens is that you end up getting a little confused, and clicking around to get another look at what that thing you need is supposed to look like.In the same sort of track, you'll sometimes run into situations where pulling off build requirements is fiddly, or even obstructed by the natural way that a faction's builds work. Specifically, humans build on their power grid, which has an alarming tendency to block off tech-attachment slots. This causes trouble for building the ""Alpha"" epic unit, because various build scenarios end up preventing your large factory from attaching everything necessary. Yes, you can rotate buildings before they're constructed, but doing so never became immediately intuitive for me. Also, once you do figure that out, there's a very real tendency that the structure won't want to attach to the grid at the point you need.I had to pause the game and go look up how to situate a factory to build the Alpha. Come on, guys...A different problem area was the fog of war on the main map. In this game, the difference between areas that have been explored, but are not currently visible is not defined well enough. This can lead to all manner of possible confusion. A bit more contrast between those two display states would make a world of difference. As it stands, there were multiple occurrences of me having to look VERY carefully at the screen to figure out what my units could and could not observe....and I was pretty shocked at how underpowered the aircraft are, with limited, ""plinky"" munitions that have to be refilled at a landing pad every 10 seconds. (Of course, aircraft can be killer when the CPU sends them against you, but you already knew that.)""Goo"" can also suffer from some rather disappointing technical problems. As far as I can tell, the game uses a client/ server architecture for even the single player campaign. This would be fine, but my game somehow managed to lose the connection to itself(!) on a regular basis. This lead to long freezes, sound problems, and even the occasional hard crash. The final insult was during the Goo campaign, when my savegames from a long and hard-fought skirmish suddenly refused to load without crashing the client.That's when I gave up.I do still recommend this title, because I think its worth experiencing. Like I said, the artwork factor is really very good - but there are lots of functional things that don't seem to have worked out. I don't want to be unnecessarily hard on the Grey Box team, but dang it, they could have hit a home run if ""Goo"" had actually worked out as a complete package.			"

												I can't reccomend this game.The single player campaigns are well done and serves well the purpose of telling the Sci Fi story of the GOO universe. That being said, the Devs really dropped the ball when it comes to skirmish games vs the AI. Small maps with confining placement options for initial bases, makes this game underwhelming for playing anything beyond the campaigns.It's obvious the development money for this game went into visual UI design, CG cut scenes and pretty landsacapes. Because  the core basebuilding mechanics, map variety and units in skirmish seem an afterthought to the CG story.Given that, I cant reccomend this game for purchase. After the single player campaigns, there is nothing more to offer from this game. And that's a huge dissapointment for RTS fans such as myself and anyone whom enjoys waging SCI-FI war, at any scale, (and not just very small venues within very pretty maps) on a supposedly large fictional planet. And just for the sake of the sheer digital fun of playing a RTS game.Skirmish simply just fails to deliver, in terms of map size, unit and structure variety, and outside of playing the goo, placement options for structures.Not worth the purchase price untill the price plummets significantly, thus justifying a game of very limited (or non existant) replayability. And for an RTS that has nothing beyond it's campaign, thats your call.That being said, at or about $12 USD is about right. But when you consider a DVD cost of 3 or more titles for the same price and hours of enjoyment....well once again. Your call, as those definately go back on a library shelf but CAN be enjoyed again at a later time. As the OS that drives a DVD player, doesn't render ones old DVD's obsolete and unusable for enjoyment.			"

												Basic game factsGrey Goo is an old-school RTS of the most direct descendant of Westwood Studios, the creators of Command and Conquer. That heritage shows clearly in the game. Since the last years only brought us MOBAs and Starcraft-type clicking frenzy games, Grey Goo returns to the roots: No unit skills, no tedious micro-tasks and a focus on strategy.Playable FactionsThe HumansWith technology evolved to an almost magic-like level, the Neo-Humans have created a society without war or woe by delegating most tasks to AI entities. After abandoning their quest to find other intelligent life, they are called to Ecosystem 09 by a mysterious signal to find themselves confronted with the need to wage war against two unexpected opponents.Playing the Humans gives the player one central powersource, to which each building has to be connected and the ability to build strong defenses and harvest resources from every point of the battlefield.The BetaAfter barely escaping extinction by a force they call ""the silent ones"", the remaining members of the Morra (called Beta by the Neo-Humans) find refuge on the Planet of Ecosystem 09. Within a generation they colonize the planet and harness it´s rich resources to prepare thier way back to the stars. Using kinetic and explosive weaponry, they find themselves attacked by unknown hostiles, which are diffrent from those they fled from.Playing the Beta one builds hubs anywhere on the map to power buildings and share technology among them. So, the Beta can build outposts everywhere and fortify every chosen position to harvest it´s resources.The GooOriginally created by the Humans to cartograph the galaxy using the so-called ""keyholes"", the Von-Neumann-Probes were abandoned by their creators, when they canceled their efforts to find intelligent life. Made to adapt to changing circumstances, these nanomachines evolved into the Goo, an all-devouring army traveling via the keyholes from world to world, devouring everything on the way back to earth.Truly innovative for the genre, the Goo has no base but formless nano-blobs that move over terrain and produce new units by consuming resources, growing and splitting off smaller parts, which are turned into combat units. The formless Goo can traverse mountains and most impassible terrain and consumes enemy ground units and structures it comes in contact with.GameplaySingleplayerThe singleplayer campaign is compelling and offers the player a well-made narrative told in high quality cutscenes and missions with changing types of objectives. From the classical ""annihilate the enemy"" to ""escort the civilians to safety"" the classics are covered. There are six missions for each faction. Every mission has bonus objectives of varying type of difficulty. The character design is nuanced and interesting, since the Beta have much more in common with the ancient humans (us) than the Neo-Humans do.MultiplayerThe Multiplayer-part is one strong side of the game. It has dedicated servers and is comparably well balanced, especially considering the existence of the Goo as playable faction. I found the macro-focused gameplay of GreyGoo the very anti-thesis to the current and announced Starcraft II. APM is not as important as having a good strategy and reacting well to your opponents decisions.GraphicsNice, polished models and effects and design by WETA. Really pretty for an RTS. The big explosion effects are missing, except for the game-ending epic units, which are, following their nametag really really epic.PerformanceWorks fine with my machine. Heard of people with older rigs having slight problems.Notable special featuresLanguagePetroglyph Games hired the very person that created the language of the Na´vi from the movie Avatar to create a language for the Morra (Beta)! It is used and subtitled in the campaign cutscenes and maybe there will be the possibility to actually learn to speak it.MusicMade by Frank Klepacki, the lead composer of the great Soundtracks of Command and Conquer, Dune and many more has created three soundtracks: Clean synthesizer music for the Humans, heavy Industrial for the Beta and classical music mixed with dubstep for the Goo!Motion CaptureThe facial animations of the characters in the cutscenes have an unusual high quality as seen in barely any game before.EditorThey included the very Editor they used for the campaign design into the game! It´s industry-level, has lots of features and is getting patched and expanded.Advanced AIThe AI of the game does not cheat. It scouts you, adapts to your strategies and has no economic advantage. AI personalities and AI difficulty can be randomized.ProblemsSmall playerbaseThe playerbase is relatively small because the marketing left to be desired. One can basically always find someone to play against, since there is a steamgroup for Grey Goo, but the long lists of custom games one would wish for are not reality.2-4 playersThe game only supports up to 4 players in multiplayer at the moment.Only 9 mapsThe map pool is tiny in comparison. Map contests and upgrades will likely follow.Balance issuesThere are some imbalances, that need work. If and how the devs will react to those, is yet to be seen, since the game has just been released recently.No destructible environmentIt´s not important but I´d like to see the Goo eat trees it moves through! It´s kinda strange to see military structures crumble and get consumed while the fauna gets spared. There is also wildlife missing and structure and unit models do not show sustained damage properly.No observer or replay functionThese are not ingame. The developer announced to be working on them since some time and promised to add them soon.AI issuesNonresponsive units just standing around somewhere or abusable pathing flaws plague the AI. Additionally, RTS-experienced players will have no problem defeating it.SummaryThis is the very game, Command and Conquer fans have been waiting for over the last years! I am confident that they will work on the small flaws of this well polished product and that more is to come!9,5/10			"

												This game is easily the greatest RTS game I've ever played, and I'm extrememly unlikely to forget it.  I have absolutely adored this game since I first tried a test build at PAX South, and the final version is a masterpiece for those that can appreciate it.  The campaign is brutally challenging and fairly engaging, but the real meat and potatoes of the game is in the multiplayer, which is just fantastic.The game operates at a speed somehwere between command and conquer and starcraft 2, little slower than starcraft, but not by much.  Because of this, unit positioning is of extreme importance.  The bulk of the game rests in microing armies of slow-moving artillery pieces, to barrage your opponent's armies, and countering for their unit-splitting measures, line of sight, and elevation.  It's really intrieguing stuff that you're sure to enjoy if you were into command and conquer in the past, but couldn't get into the imbalanced and chaotic multiplayer of the older titles.  It's CnC through the lens of starcraft, borrowing mechanics from other games all the while.If you're at all interested, it gets featured in bundles, and goes on sale frequently.  I cannot reccomend this game more highly at all.  I fell in love with this game, and I hope you will as well.			"

												Game is really good overall. The classes do feel really balanced and I find all three classes pretty fun. What this game doesn't do unlike other rts games such as starcraft is each unit having their own counters based on different races. All units do have counters but it's more each unit has an objective such as seiging instead of army combat etc. The game is really well optimised and I have not had any frame rate drops with all four players on max size armies. The graphics are also quite pretty, especially for an rts game. You can feel the command and conquer influence when playing it but that's to be expected due to the developers and it's also a damn good thing anyway. Overall, I would say it's worth picking up at the full price and I believe this has potential to become a big game with a good following.			"

ProsThree very asymmetrical and balanced factions. For a game that's been out less than two weeks, there is no single dominant strategy or faction in multiplayer.Simplified and streamlined base-building and unit production (macro) allows for more focus on the fun parts of RTS, namely, strategy and tactics (micro).Slow movement speed and extremely powerful artillery heavily discourages deathballs, and encourages you to spread your forces around the map. I personally maintain three armies of mixed unit types on the map at any given time.Short but challenging singleplayer campaign (5 missions per faction for a total of 15 missions). You gain access to your entire arsenal very quickly, and the difficulty ramps up so quickly that many players have been stuck even on Easy Mode.Visually spectacular and well-acted CGI cutscenes between missions.Map editor with Steam Workshop integration.LAN multiplayer and offline play. None of this always online nonsense with other modern games.ConsErratic optimization issues. The game runs sluggishly on some systems way over the recommended system requirements, but runs well on some older systems. Devs are working on this issue.Unintentional region locking. Devs have confirmed that Steam accidentally region locked the game, and they're working on a fix.Aircraft AI is terrible. First, they deal massive overkill when on attack-move command, and they automatically return to the battlefield if they're order to attack or attack-move. This is contrary to established C&C aircraft behavior, and makes it difficult to keep track of them and to keep them alive. A lesser issue is that aircraft don't have a separate rally point or head to the nearest airpad when they're built, increasing the difficulty in keeping track of them.It's expensive! $50 (USD) is a lot to ask for, and will greatly limit this game's playerbase until this game goes on sale or the price is permanently lowered. I'd like to say that it's worth the price, but I actually got this from a key reseller for only $35 (USD).No replays and no observer mode. This means that it's near impossible to analyze and share strategies, and it's pretty much impossible to determine game balance issues (be they actual gameplay balance or map balance). The devs are working on implementing these two features, though. "

Product received for free
Grey Goo PC Review Grey Goo?     The title Grey Goo makes all of us curious and wonder in amazement and perplextion. Are there blobs of goo we will have to defend against as in a literal term of the word? Is it rather a metaphor that means that things are black-and-gray or gray-and-white? Rather, does the title emphasize some motif within the game's storyline or is it rather a reference to some enemy that we cannot find out until we get very far in the game's progression? The publisher Grey Box fails to clue us in individually. When I first heard of this game, the title immediately appealed to me. It drove me back into time when I played De Blob 2 by THQ which was rather a game about restoring color to cities and environments taken over by these so-called ' inklings.'  Grey Goo rather seems to be an implication of a whole alien race in this real-time strategy game with Multiplayer Online Battle Arena ( MOBA) elements inspired throughout, heavily. Quick-View Substantiation/ Summation Grey Goo derived its roots from Command and Conquer 3 and went back to the earliest elements of the MOBA genre before it became popularized in recent years by Dota 2. The gameplay mechanics are outdated by modern standards because they are relatively simplistic in design. You have a central hub of different sizes, small, medium and large. All immovable units, as a result, must be connected to this hub. All hubs have at the minimum, one refinery, and one extraction. The refinery is used up in the production of resources, while the extraction is to extract the building materials and components to form the full byproducts of all of our structures. In real-life economics, you need one primary source in which you can produce your resources. Then, you have to feed those resources through a production line to generate materials at a constant rate without any intermission throughout the whole process.  Grey Goo is easy on the eyes for most gamers, while lighter shades of colors were used in the environment and background. The presentation is quite similar to a crossover between Starcraft II and the Command and Conquer series. The presentation of the gameplay is exactly like Command and Conquer while it incorporates MOBA gameplay for portable units, which are capable of destroying towers and occupying the enemy's territory to advance farther alone. The ultimate goal at the end of each mission, similarly, is to destroy the opposing faction's core which is protected by heavily fortified units. Keep in mind that only mobile units ( i.e. predator which is a robot-type Velociraptor and then mechs that remind me of the walkers in Star Wars games and movies) can attack towers and fully destroy cores. Separate from your mobile units; the stationary units are placed on the entire map to protect enemies from destroying our base. Presentation - 10/10 - Lovely presentation. Starcraft II-esque graphics for the storyline with excellent cutscenes, alright voice acting, and a beautiful array of colors that suit the classic real-time strategy environment well.Graphics - 7/10 - Graphics are ok for its time but are outdated by modern standards of what MOBA's and real-time strategy games are capable of today.Gameplay - 6/10 - Gameplay is ok but nothing special because it follows the same formula that other games similar to this have followed for too long without offering anything particularly new to gamer's plates.Controls - 10/10 - Controls are great, responsive. The main menu gives you the option to rebind any key bindings and even allows the denotation of hotkeys which is a must in a game of this caliber.Entertainment Value - 6/10 - Decent. It is clear that there is a particular niche audience for Grey Goo. Some will find the game very entertaining, while people like me that expected so much from this game will see the entertainment value as low, but the retention value as high.Overall Score - 8/10 MOBA Combat     The MOBA aspects of Grey Goo is its primary strength, while its weakest aspect is using the same boring and repetitive formula of tower defense based real-time strategy with setting up units, waiting until those are built, then overtaking other areas that are compatible to have resources placed on the map. Then, rinse and repeat. I see how this can get very repetitive as time goes on mission to mission. The MOBA combat adds an action portion to Grey Goo, thankfully, because most of the rest of the game without the MOBA elements are static throughout the whole game despite new structures added in. You have to build robot type animals and mechs to advance which you control by clicking in the direction you want to move ( i.e. Starcraft II, Pillars of Eternity). Cutscenes     The cutscenes are a hallmark within Grey Goo; they are of movie quality of Star Trek, Star Wars, even of Starcraft II. The storyline occurs after missions have been completed and during the progression of new enemies arising. The story is the most interesting aspect by far because it shows the alien race and all the factions we will have battled by the end of the game. The story connects the purpose of our missions towards the reason we are placing structures and fulfilling specific objectives with minimum, sufficient and necessary requirements. The story and cutscenes are a welcomed addition and will be the main selling point of the game for many years to come.   The MOBA Mechanics Dota 2 and League of Legends both have a health bar to represent the health you have left when attacking enemy mobs. Grey Goo used this concept as well as voice notifications every time new structures you have placed are built when you perform certain actions or even need to repair your defenses. The voiced announcements and MOBA movement are the second strongest selling factor in the game and align perfectly within the context of the cutscenes as well as being the respiratory system of the action used to propel the game and keep gamers interested, intrigued before and after every mission.Gamephasis Disclaimer     Gamephasis www.gamephasis.com is a new gaming website featuring a talented team of game writers from around the world.

												A fairly fun game with some amazing visual wonks and good hotkey system. However the campaign missions so far have been a practice in annoyance. I will recommend this on the skirmish mode alone, but the computer AI needs some tweeks to make the missions less...frustrating. I bought the game on TB's comment that it is a base defender type game and great for gamers that are not click ninjas or over caffienated teenagers. The game seems to switch between micromanagement armageddon (third campaign mission, with added shaking screen and repair mini game!) and slow buildup of forces only to have them wiped out by one unit. It is very rock paper scissors. The humans are also incredibly gimped by their need to connect each building to the main hub with ""conduits"" that have the armor and health of a child in cardboard armor. I will come back to it after its had more time in the oven ;)			"

												Goo buy it! Grey Goo is an awesome RTS!!!There is something about great RTS battles that you take with you for life, and GreyGoo is a new proving ground for those experiences to flourish. It offers both a rich cinematic-laden experience for the single player campaign, as well as a challenging and competitive multi-player experience (check out the GreyGoo Twitch streams).Ever since I first played the original Warcraft I have been an RTS fan. I'll never forget being at my friend's house for a sleepover where we linked two computers with a serial cable and played a Humans vs. Orks deathmatch. We'd let our peons and peasants hack at trees all night and wake up to spend all our vast resources of gold and lumber for an epic battle. Fast forward to now and we have GreyGoo, a fresh RTS experience that brings back to the forefront all the things I remember loving about RTS games in the past, while also distinguishing itself in a modern way amidst the other giants in the genre.In short, GreyGoo has a great story, AWESOME cinematics/graphics, unique races, and gameplay. It's definitely worth it for any RTS fan, and the money you pay is saving you the torture of the Free-To-Play ad ridden, pay-to-win, pay-to-not-loose-years-of-your-life model of games!So whether you are a long time fan of the genre, or are new to it, goo get this for your RTS collection!

												It's a ton of fun, the graphics are nice, and the storyline is compelling. The epic units are unbalanced and the Goo epic unit seems very overpowered compared to the other two factions.The universe they've crafted has a ton of room to grow, and I hope the developers will continue to add new content. I didn't find much replay value in the game - but I also play RTS games mostly for the campaigns, not the multiplayer, so my opinion doesn't represent the typical player.Overall, it's definitely a good RTS. The three factions work very differently, and learning to work with each system as you go along is a nice exercise.If there is more campaign DLC down the road, I'll definitely buy it.			"

												Honestly, it's a really fun game that's receiving a hell of a lot of support from the developers. You have so many AAA titles come out from EA, Ubisoft, ect that get little to no support. They ship out a broken game, ask for money for a bunch of content that should have already been in the game, and then leave you with a broken product you had a lot of hope for that crashed and burned after a few months. Grey Goo had a rough release, but the developers have been continuing to create an awesome gaming experience. They promote tournaments, regularly communicate with the community and keep us in the know of future development. Thanks for the hard work and keep it up guys!			"

If those problems are fixed, it will become an awesome game. Updated correctly, this game could easily rise to the level of Starcraft and Supreme Commander.

												I like Grey Goo a lot and I don't understand it's mixed rating on Steam.People are saying that the game was not stable. I've started to play on day 1 and performance was pretty stable with nice FPS.People are saying that the game is too difficult. I beat it on hard difficulty with all possible achievments (even saved all humans) and I am not korean. Again, I've satrted to play on day 1 before any patches.People are saying that the game lacks content. I have spend 20 hours to beat the campaign and got more fun than with any of LotV or HotS campaigns.People are saying it's not like SC2/bad clone of SC2. It is game of it's own and there is nothing wrong with that.People are sa... Well, you've got an idea.PROs:- Graphics- Solid campaign, setting and story- Asymmetrical factions, Goo faction is something very unique.- Frank Klepacki OST :)- Micromanagement concept and map design. While many people think that micro means special abilities, this game builds around positioning. You can annihilate an entile army or loose an entire army just becasue of that.- Hotkey concept is awesome and way better than in SC2.CONs:- Unit variety can be better.MIXED:- More hardware demanding than StarCraft 2 but nothing extraudinary.

												All of my units are destroyed except for my proto purger (epic unit) and another one being built, all the while my last mother goo (base) is hiding on a mountain next to about 20 to 30 enemy units. At this point the entire map is nothing but red dots representing the human extractors, earlier I got a look at the the enemy base teeming with refinerys, factories and turrets noticing the fatal flaw in all of it. It was all connected by power cord. I made several attempts to severe this cord effectively powering down all enemy turrets, with no success. But my second proto purger was finally completed  and I moved the to like massive tanks across the land, and climbing over mountains directly in to the enemy base, I then attacked removing several power cords including the one powering it all. I then took my time demolishing each one of the enemy's refinerys, at this point being some where near the 30s and ended it all with the human headquarters being shattered in to nothing by the two epic units. They don't get the label for nothing.			"

												RTS strategy games are not dead, at least not in the case of Grey Goo. The story campaign is not the longest one, but it doesnt lack awesome animations, good story and different mission playstyles. The best thing are different races that you can control, each one has different building strategies and therefore the playthrough is variable.The units are well crafted and especially epic units pack a serious punch that can destroy whole armies. No fan of RTS games should overlook Grey Goo.			"

												 If you like Command and Conquer, you will probably like this. It looks very appealing. The CG during campaign is very well done. Also, the AI won't instantly zerg rush you like some of the modern games available now. That to me is a cheesy way to appeal to ""hardcore"" gamers while making the game inaccessible to casual gamers. It will send armys to keep you on your toes, but in my time with this game it didn't feel cheap (Age of Wonders for reference). I like time to set things up before getting into the fray, so for me this was very pleasing.  The negatives are probably the limited options available. The units feel pretty generic. The tech boosts don't convey a sense of elevated ability. It can take what feels like fifteen minutes to dispatch a enemy base with a full population cap army. This might appeal to some multiplayer gamers. But it just doesn't feel like you are a group of bad dudes roughing up the opponent with your high tech gear. It feels like you are shooting bottle rockets at a brick wall. Also, just for future game companies of the genre who might read this: spice it up. Unit variation is good. Powered up tech is good. Wouldn't it be cool if the enemy base was hiding a nuclear bomb or something and your army was unaware and upon catastrophic fail your attacking army was blown up in a huge explosion? Or how about if damage was registered more realistically, with pieces falling off or parts exploding in a shower of molten metal? That would be so awesome and increase the playability. You see it in other games. Just feels no one really innovates anymore in these games. As a fan, it leads to a stale kind of feeling. Nothing breaks you out of the feeling of gaming more than sitting for 15 minutes while you hear ""pew pew"" and see the same flashes and explosions. This is a good Command and Conquer style game. If you like that, you will probably like this. It is a bit generic, but it is well done generic. I got it on sale for twenty bucks. I would say it is worth that for sure. Just don't expect ground breaking stuff.			"

Build bases, gather resources to expand your base, build units (infantry, tanks, artillary, air to ground, ground to air, spy units), upgrade those units, build walls, mount tanks on those walls! Protect your base and infiltrate the enemy base, find and help fellow units around the maps for side quests. Destroy your enemy!!			"

												It's decent, good take on a strategy game and definitly a good story line. Obvious sequel to the game, going to get it as soon as it comes out. Overall:Good:- Classes are awesome and each has it's own strong qaulities.- Good looking game, graphics was to my liking.- Multiplayer against AI is difficult, this is a good thing.- Story is epic.- Gameplay is fun and didn't feel any issues with the classes. All the classes are awesome to play with.Bad:- The Goo class feels like it's lacking some good units, I wouldn't mind them having flying units.- campaign does feel a bit short, makes up with the multiplayer atleast. There is also the DLC, but they could have just added it (corporate commander crap).- Mission do feel a bit repetative, stuff like the goo being able to cross mountains could have been focused on more. I could easily win a match by just building a large army or an epic unit. There wasn't any challenging (strategic thinking) matches. Except for the first Goo mission thoughOverall a good game, regardless of it's bad points. I Don't regret getting this.			"

												This is an excellent piece of software. The UI is clean and well thought out, the cut scenes exceptional and the story arc intriguingly different to many others in this arena.

												I'm only an hour into this game, and as we all know the RTS community tends to look for games with a lot of staying power. Rather than try and talk through every single bit and piece of the game I'm going to give my first impressions, then later on I'll try and throw something more complete up.First things first: it's gorgeous. The cutscenes, the units, the buildings, everything feels really solid. I will say that my computer chugged a bit on the menu and at the beginning of each cutscene, but my computer (while pretty nice) isn't top of the line. Specs at the bottom if anyone cares. Weirdly enough the actual gameplay doesn't seem to have any slowdowns at all, so I'm wondering if it's just some minor glitch that'll be patched out.Next up: it's fun! Most of the gameplay is pretty intuitive, the units respond in fairly interesting ways, and in general the game feels like a competent studio worked on it. The only real issue I had as the Beta in the campaign was a mild misunderstanding of the hub system, and if I'm being honest that's probably more down to me being oblivious than anything.I haven't tried multiplayer at all as yet (waiting on a couple of friends to pick it up), but the gameplay seems like it would translate really easily and well to multiplayer.The tutorial section of the campaign does a good job of explaining things, and the fact that the tooltips are visible without being overwhelming or intrusive was really nice.Apparently there's a map editor, and I can hardly wait to start tinkering around with that!Apparently a fair number of the people in the developer came out of Westwood, and I can only say hurrah to that! I loved me some Red Alert back before the black hole known as EA destroyed them and it's good to see that they seem to be back in business! One thing I wish they'd bring back is the faction system that existed in Emperor: Battle for Dune. The faction/subfaction choices added a lot of spice to that game, though the overall game sadly doesn't really hold up these days.PC specs:CPU: AMD Phenom II 1100t black x6 (running @ 3.3 Ghz)Memory: 8gb 1600 hz RAMGPU: Nvidia GTX 760 (EVGA card)My hard drive is pretty much garbage, but that just means slightly longer load times.

												I originally couldn't launch this game and just let it set in my library. I gave it another go the other day and found it works now and that it... works impressively well on my potato of a laptop with beautiful graphics and zero frame drops to speak of.The campaign story is a bit lacking from what I've seen but the gameplay itself is interesting to say the least, real strategy is required as it's all too easy to throw isolated groups of units into the enemy's meat grinder and be very wasteful. The tutorial is a voluntary thing as it's a bunch of messages in the corner you can completely ignore if you so desire, very unintrusive.Mind you this is not some genre defining work of art but at the same time there is not anything that comes to mind when I think ""what is wrong with this game"" and I genuinely enjoy the gameplay and visuals.Simply put I cannot think of a reason why you MUST have this game but also have no reason to tell you to avoid it, multiplayer issues can be solved by having a friend who has it and the game runs shockingly well on low end machines.

												Definetly one of the best RTS games out there, graphics are good, campaign is basically a massive multi-faction tutorial and the skirmish mode is equally as satisfying. It's quite simple compared to many others and thats what makes it great. It really is alot like the original starcraft but with a much more interesting campaign and factions that have completely different playstyles. Each faction playes differently than the other, and each faction has many different ways to play within itself, because of having such a vast selection of specialized units available. You can rush with basic infantry all the way to the end of the game if your fast enough, or play the defensive and build mega units that crush everything in their way. The GOO faction really puts a twist on how an RTS can be played and Im glad someone finally changed the genre up.The default Hotkeys are kind of confusing and there's just too many of them, its' a good idea to play the tutorial missions and then go and re-map the hotkeys that you use the most into one spot on the keyboard.

												Since now I have the time, I'm rewriting my review to actually be more descriptive.First of all, let me explain some of the negative reviews you'll find both here and around the Internet. When this game came out, it had several important technical issues, poor marketing and a quite big pricetag, as well as some unbalance. Most of the negative reviews come from those days. Luckly, the devs have been working very hard to fix all of that, and wow they did: technical issues fixed, pricetag reduced to normal levels permanently, free DLCs, and a 4th race also for free. Not to mention the huge dedication the devs are pouring on the community as well, by answering the forums regularly and organizing tournaments.To put it simply: when you check other reviews about Grey Goo, pay attention to the date of those reviews. In its current state, it is more than worth every cent.I prefer to start by the negative points, so let's go for them:- Because of its bad start, it has a limited playerbase. Everyone could guess the current efforts to improve the game are aimed to bring more players to it, and I can understand that, given the huge amount of work dedicated to it. I guess it will need some time to grow a good playerbase, but so far it has been growing. If everything else about this game appeals to you, then by all means buy it, so that the community will grow.- Campaign is short for a classic RTS. It is well done, but players that go after lenghty SP experienced would prefer something more. It is played with the 3 original factions, looking at the conflict from their respective points of view, and aimed to learn to use each faction. That said, the conflict in the story is relatively small-sized, so it kind of makes sense to have a short campaign.Those are the bad points. Now to the good stuff!- It just feels fresh, yet like a good ol' RTS. While some will see some inspiration taken from big hits like Starcraft, the whole story and its factions are very original. The whole makes a very interesting sci-fi universe.- Gameplay feels comfortable and varied. Each faction plays utterly different from the others, especially at the base-building and unit-managing levels. Humans are the high tech ones (for once!) and focus on small, dense bases with powerful defenses and teleportation. Beta feel more traditional, and know how to garrison properly. The Goo is very mobile (they don't even have buildings, only formless masses of nanobots that spawn the actual units), and can adapt very fast. The Shroud is deceptive and its units complement each other well (even their buildings can support each other).In addition, there is a wide variety of units for each faction, divided on ground and air units, each adapted to a role. There also are epic units, which are as devastating and cool as they sound.- Art design is gorgeous, both in visuals and audio, both in quotes, FX and soundtrack (which btw is a free DLC).  One of my biggest dislikes of Starcraft 2 is that its art style looks too cartoonish and limited after all those cool cutscenes. Grey Goo knows how to provide some cool models.- Steam Workshop! Used for designing maps. There has been at least one map contest, with nice prices for the winners.The following points are very nice in my opinion, but I understand other players might not like them, so I have them separated from the previous ones.- Gameplay is not micro-intensive, like SC2. You don't need to have lightning-fast reflexes and muscle memory to use abilities. There are no active abilities in Grey Goo. Units can be upgraded with passive abilities, which alleviates the stress on the player. For example: from the Goo, have your artillery shots heal your nearby troops.About those upgrades: you can't have them all. Each faction has 5 upgrade categories, 3 upgrades on each. You can only have 1 from each category. In my opinion, this is a great way to encourage players to develop their own strategies.- The game is designed with competitive play in mind. There are ranked matches aside from custom ones. By unlocking certain achievements (not the Steam ones), you unlock player avatars from the game's units and places, with a cool lore description for each. To sum up, it's a great RTS game that while it certainly had a bad start, it has improved a lot in all senses, and has a lot to enjoy, If you are looking for a RTS game that is not a copy of SC2 and feels like an oldschool RTS, this game is for you.

												Campaign looks okay to me but the multiplayer sucks. Grey Goo resembles another RTS called Etherium but it's just not as interesting. Some of the ideas, like teleportation, are kind of badly executed in Grey Goo. You can find similar ideas in Starcraft 2 but better executed to suit how the user plays the game.I completed the Beta and Human campaigns but the gameplay just wasn't engaging enough to make me want to play more. I uninstalled just before the Grey Goo campaign.PROS1. Campaign looks GoodI like the single player map, looks really good. Very well designed.2. MarketingI've heard of Grey Goo.3. Tree CoverGood to hide in. Like the way you can attack from cover, this is the part that resembles Etherium.4. Graphics ***Top notch. These are the best that I've seen out of most the RTS games that I have played. E.g. Lucy Tang, the commander of the Human faction just looks so real.CONS1. MultiplayerEvery single race is the same, they just have different skins. Units are basically divided into Light, Heavy, Air, Stealth and Ultimate. 2. Complex Building PuzzlesEvery race has their own jigsaw puzzle to figure out.a. GooYou need Mother Goos to slime their way to the resource pool and grow fat. After growing fat, they split like an amoeba and form Small/Large Proteans, which have to be split into the actual units. This notion is really ridiculous.b. BetaAliens in this game. Absolutely horrible, you have to attach attachments to Factories just to build the required units, wasting a ridiculous amount of timec. HumansJust like the Beta with even more complex building jigsaws as you have to lay power lines that cost resources. In this game, the humans resemble an alien race instead. Their buildings can teleport but it's rubbish since you have to connect them to a power conduit.3. Multiple Annoying StepsYou have to do so many tiny steps to achieve your objective that it's no longer fun. Here are a few examples.a. Building High Tier UnitsFor every factory, you have to add attachments. You have 4 to choose from, Air, Tank, Stealth and Artillery. In order to build certain units, you have to add combinations like Tank and Artillery REPEATEDLY FOR EVERY NEW FACTORY. You can share certain upgrades for the Humans by building an upgrade in between 2 factories but that's only possible if you build a conduit long enough to build them side by side.b. Beta DefensesBeta's have some sort of garrisoning procedure where their units climb onto walls/platforms to shoot from. Instead of building a defense turret, you have to first build a wall, then build a unit, then get him to jump on it. What's worse is that each factory only produces 1 unit and each wall tower only garrisons 1 unit.c. Goo SpawningYou have to keep splitting up the Small/Large Goos or feed them to the Protean Purger. What the hell is this?4. Short Campaign Way to short5. RepairingIt is so annoying to have to click and repair each individual item.6. Air Units Reloading and Landing DeckAmmunition reloading? You also need a landing deck to keep the air units in. This is reminiscent of Command and Conquer's flaws. Also, the air units in this game are horribly underpowered.7. Extractors and VisionIn order to build an Extractor on a Catalyst Pool, you actually need vision of the pool. Somehow, the developers designed the Refinery's vision to be just out of reach of the pool. Thus, forcing one to send 1 unit just to scout.8. Extractor Resource RateDepending on exact location of where you place your Extractor, you will get +8/+10/+13 resource rate and this is all a matter of placing your cursor 1 milimetre to the left or right. This is also linked to point 7.			"

												I have never before been so burned from a game purchase. Between some kind of online system while playing single player which disconects periodicly causeing almost constant lag and unplayably laggy online multiplayer I cannot recomend purchase of Grey Goo. When it does work it's a pretty fun RTS which is a genre that needs more new games. But as of the writeing of this review the game is unplayable. It is worth noteing that I have played throughthe majority of the campain which my time played does not reflect. The single player can be played while offline which I did by disableing my internet connection to get rid of the disconnecton lag. I don't like the gameplay of the goo so it's sections during the campain are very frustrateing.			"

												This is definetly worth buying if you like RTS titles. Its cinematic attributes are pretty stellar, something unseen elsewise outside of C&C full studio acting. (AWESOME)Good RTSs have ben pretty rare for a long time but (in my opinion...) GG does a real good job upsetting said trend.Alot of people bash this as being dull and lacking a unique unit set but I have say that's BS. Rarely does any game have super unique structures between units like C&C, AoE, etc, the base structure in any game is going to be tediously similar but GG still has some good unique attributes between its FOUR races.It does feel kinda like starcraft 2 but that's just a good thing for SC fans. Likewise, this is a Great RTS and worth a play through and some multiplay.			"

												You know, I'm a huge RTS fan. Played every warcraft, red alert c&c you could think of and this is just bleh. It isn't interesting, it isn't difficult, it feels like an introduction to RTS games for children before they play the decade old starcraft. This game is behind SC2 somehow. I cannot believe I allowed good reviews to convince me this was good.			"

												Grey goo honestly has all the hallmarks of a great game. What did it for me in the end was that I found skirmish games too quick. There was little to no way to have a longer game as it'd become evident fairly quickly who the dominant power was in the game. It is unfortunate really as I quite like the different races. Would I still recommend the game? Well the storyline is not too bad, and I like to support developers like these guys, so yes, I'd recommend it in the hopes that by supporting them, they'll release another one which has a bit more depth to it with a scale similar to what you see in the trailers..

Anyways, the game is beautifully rendered, the models used in briefings and cutscenes are incredible, they almost look like people in makeup rather than CGI and the voices are quite good (although the heavy Australian(?) accent for the Beta's was quite a shock to get used to).

												Here's the thing, I like RTs and am a hardcore fan, but I don't like to go pro online, or anything like that as I never like online systems, and the same will be with this game, so I play skrimish, campaign and with friends, but STILL there are major problems I see. Cons-1. The Humans- The humans are more for turtling, but you can't build beyond your starting position most of the time because conduits can't go over any terrain basically. So supply lines get huge and you must divert your forces to protect the miners. The Beta and Goo don't have this problem, and THIS IS MAJOR!!!! because resources run out which pisses me off a little. Just make it either slow regeneration or less income once it reaches the bottom don't remove it all together. 2. Unit Cap- I don't want a game very similar to starcraft. I want a game like CnC with as many units as the computer can take, massive.... MASSIVE battles(also like many huge RTS games) having a unit cap takes away from that. It makes the game more limited. 3. Player Count- 4.....really? Only 4? From what I've seen 4 players is it which at that point I'm like, ""LAME!""4. Campaign gameplay- Well if you've played it, most people will probably be like c'mon wanna play the Goo campaign. Well 15 missions essentially and 90% of them are kill the enemy. there are at most 3 that aren't ""kill the enemy"". It's fine if it's like that but maybe have cool assaults or epic maps, nah. There are never more than 3 more commanders on the field. You only get an ally for one mission(haven't 100% the goo yet as I need a brake from ""KILL THE ENEMY!"") and that mission is kill the enemy. Not hold off and distract long enough to detonate the bomb(sorry spoilers) just kill the enemy. There are probably other problems but before I stop. 5. Player Content- ok love it how they support the community....steam workshop? Um can you mod this for more unit cap or stuff like that?(You can but the config is a .MEG file...REALLY?!) They do support it but they shouldn't rely on people to make cooler maps to add to their collections. There is only like 7 maps...only 7 and most of them are very similar. I REALLY HOPE that the community through mods if they can and maps make this game much better. If they can make unlimited unit cap and balance the races more to cope with that. Make it so that the player count is 8 or above for better play(if they can) etc...Pros...Sorry fror bashing on a game but people need to understand from a casual gamer what it is like playing a game and what you should get, but here are the pros. Camapign Cutscenes- Beautiful and stay with the story. They can immerse you in the universe fairly quickly but sadly what it seems like you're doing from the cutscenes doesn't happen in the gameplay half the time. Factions- Now I know I bashed on the humans but the factions are unique, especially the Goo. If they kill something they use the matter to grow and reporudce more quickly. The regular goo can quickly consume enemies that are alone or in small groups and can flee up terrain once done. owever to limit their OPness on the ground they get no air. Sadly the Goo and Humans are very similar to Earth's 2160 counterparts. Epics- Now the epics are essentially the Titans of Warhammer. They are ultimate units and deserve to be for taking up 70 unit cap. However each is unique to the faction. The humans sport a collosal humanoid robot with a large beam that seeps and kills most units in it's path. The purger for the Goo is the ultimate evolution and can attack from range while also getting close and absorbing the enemies through a potent (I guess melee attack). The Beta get a mobile fortress which can produce units and house them for close range defense. Learning Curve- Factions are easy to learn but definitely hard to master. Now I know it looks like I dislike this game, I don't it's just I expect better now. I mean to put a unit cap and then express how the game would run smoothlymakes me say ""really? maybe the game runs smoothly not because of the servers but the unit cap?"" Also the factions still need work even though polish was done some very clear things should be fixed. like Humans and Beta should be able to build more command centrs(Goo can.....and humans need it to continue to expand). This game is worth the money but not more worth it and that makes me sad. Until player content streams in this game is not that great to me. Any RTS fans wanting something new though go ahead and try it, you'll get your money's worth. Rating: 7/10 (Not bad, but not great either).			"

												Nice game, a refreshing change from SC2 (the most dominant RTS lately).It's kinda simple, with only 1 resource type, no need to build ""house""-like types (like pylons etc, you always start at 200 max) and mostly small maps, the games are short, semi-fast paced which is both positive and negative.Also, you do not need to make typical harvesters, which, along with the reasons mentioned above, make this game kinda casual.Each race can only make about 10 different units + 1 super unit, which is kinda low/average but like any other rts games, the weakest units will not get used.In this game, early game is everything, since in the words of the devs: ""Focuses on large scale decision making"", means that snowballing is more effective, micro is less required and the person who gets the better headstart through better build order, unit splitting and tactical decision making will likely win.The biggest upside to this game is the Goo race, which is the most unique form of RTS playstyle i have ever seen.You do not have a typical base, instead you have a Mother Goo which can split into units or other Mother Goo, allowing for exponantial growth (until you hit the cap) allowing you to quickly take over defensive opponents.The biggest need for change is the upgrade system. About 50% of the upgrades are typically worthless because of how specific they are. the other 50% are only sometimes taken, depending on the situation.Overall I'd give this game a 7.5/10 hoping it will grow to have more features, more maps, more units etc etc.			"

												If you enjoy a slightly slower paced RTS where you don't need god like reflexes to be number one and actually planning and macro mean a lot more this is the game for you. This game deserves far more attention then its getting and if i hadn't looked at the developer i would have mistaken it for a AAA company for sure. As the others have mentioned the downsides are they low number of maps and small campaign but with the map editor at least one of those should be a non issue relatively soon. If your looking for a super amazing story you won't find it here. That's not to say its not good but it certainly lacks the universe a game like SC has to draw from. Give this game a shot you definetly will not regret it.			"

Also the factions still need work even though polish was done some very clear things should be fixed. like Humans and Beta should be able to build more command centrs(Goo can.....and humans need it to continue to expand). This game is worth the money but not more worth it and that makes me sad. Until player content streams in this game is not that great to me. Any RTS fans wanting something new though go ahead and try it, you'll get your money's worth. Rating: 7/10 (Not bad, but not great either).			"

												Nice game, a refreshing change from SC2 (the most dominant RTS lately).It's kinda simple, with only 1 resource type, no need to build ""house""-like types (like pylons etc, you always start at 200 max) and mostly small maps, the games are short, semi-fast paced which is both positive and negative.Also, you do not need to make typical harvesters, which, along with the reasons mentioned above, make this game kinda casual.Each race can only make about 10 different units + 1 super unit, which is kinda low/average but like any other rts games, the weakest units will not get used.In this game, early game is everything, since in the words of the devs: ""Focuses on large scale decision making"", means that snowballing is more effective, micro is less required and the person who gets the better headstart through better build order, unit splitting and tactical decision making will likely win.The biggest upside to this game is the Goo race, which is the most unique form of RTS playstyle i have ever seen.You do not have a typical base, instead you have a Mother Goo which can split into units or other Mother Goo, allowing for exponantial growth (until you hit the cap) allowing you to quickly take over defensive opponents.The biggest need for change is the upgrade system. About 50% of the upgrades are typically worthless because of how specific they are. the other 50% are only sometimes taken, depending on the situation.Overall I'd give this game a 7.5/10 hoping it will grow to have more features, more maps, more units etc etc.			"

												If you enjoy a slightly slower paced RTS where you don't need god like reflexes to be number one and actually planning and macro mean a lot more this is the game for you. This game deserves far more attention then its getting and if i hadn't looked at the developer i would have mistaken it for a AAA company for sure. As the others have mentioned the downsides are they low number of maps and small campaign but with the map editor at least one of those should be a non issue relatively soon. If your looking for a super amazing story you won't find it here. That's not to say its not good but it certainly lacks the universe a game like SC has to draw from. Give this game a shot you definetly will not regret it.			"

												Awesome single player, with perhaps the most unforgiving AI i've seen yet in comparison to other games. Cool factions that feel different, and fun to be playing a RTS that doesn't feel like you must know the build order or be doomed. The units are fun and you don't need to worry about a hundred minor abilities that each unit has. I also like that it builds the gatherers for you. I just wish  the multiplayer was a bit more active, i don't think too many poeple are aware of this game yet, so it can be a bit of wait to find match. Its nice to be able to say that i think this game is under hyped, which is a bit of a  novelty in itself these days			"

												i got this as part of a bundle cheap, it was worth the price of the bundle just for this game which i had wanted for a while.it seems a bit short, (especially getting a new race but no campaign for them is odd) but it was fun and pretty interesting factions.if you don't like RTS games this one will not change your mind. but it is nice to see a new and good quality RTS game again and with interesting factionsthough the replay value is not there as much for me, as it is with some other RTS games in skermish, since the starting points on the map are fixed and the smaps are smaller in general, but after a while i may play through the story agin, or vs if i ever find someone else that playsit's worth getting for sure, the DLC a bit less so though			"

												Fun RTS with fun and unique factions. The Goo faction is by far my favourite and is actually what I've always dreamed Starcraft's Zerg would be. The campaign is quite short and I'm still not sure if the ending actually is the ending, but in my opinion it's more fun than C&C has been in years.			"

												This RTS reminds me of starcraft, it's fast, good UI and clearly optimized for APM. But it also takes alot from Universe at War.The Goo, which names the game, plays very differently from other factions, without buildings and having a ""moving base"". But every faction has its inovations and is well thought. Beta relies on bullet weapons and are my favorite; Humans are very advanced and mostly control robots and energy.It has very nice graphics and gameplay and captivating videos between missions in campaign mode. Skirmish matches against AI are fun and there's still ranked MP, in my opinion easily deserves a buy either in sale or not.			"

												Changed my review from a ""would not recommend"" to a ""would recommend.""I (among other people) originally had an issue with running the game, which it appears has been addressed! The issue was that my game simply would not load upon startup, only a boot a small process that did nothing.  After many hours of tinkering and checking forums to look for a fix, nothing worked.  Happy to say that I booted the game after not touching it for the weekend, and it works!Game plays great. I love the focus on macro production and the slower pace. Definitely brings me back to older RTS games that I loved growing up.  I hate to say that I'm awful at it, but I'm sure that'll change.Voice acting is startlingly good, as well as the cutscenes.  Each class seems unique and interesting to play. Definitely worth picking up if you love the RTS genre, and definitely if it's on sale if you're on the fence.			"

												Do you like real time strategy games? Remember when they were made by people who actually gave a crap about making all the parts of the game awesome?Grey Goo is a lovingly crafted RTS with a stellar soundtrack, good story, and very solid presentation.Imagine Command and Conquer of old, mixed with the asymetric feeling of the races from Starcraft, and instead of FMV's with cheesy acting, awesome CGI movies with good voice acting.The interface takes a little getting used to, and the campaign is a bit shorter than I would have liked, but overall, I'd call this the best RTS I've played in years. It's certainly on par with Blizzard's offerings, possibly even better in the Campaign area.My only real complaint is that there aren't more missions to play (except a small DLC), because the story leaves you wanting to know more about this universe where humans are the aggressors and the words ""the goo is everywhere"" are uttered with complete seriousness and can be taken at face value.

												I pay attention to all RTS that comes out and Grey Goo got published an article about the new concepts you could find in-game and the concern to make all races unique. Before playing the game most of Screenshots were focused in the Human Race and besides being extremely well thought and well done, I disliked the style. Due to the article though, I followed the development distantly.Now the game is out, I bought it and recommend to any RTS player.In my case, I'm a casual player that likes the classic RTS management, so I liked the BETAs more than anything. The GOOs are interesting and the HUMANs didn't get much better from my earlier preconceived perception. But I still see them (G+H) as NPC (non-playable character). Besides that, they are formidable opponents in Skirmishes and Single Player. If you tend to be a RTS player, be thorough with the critics you read, mainly those that complains too much using the usual arguments (price, unfinished game, etc). This is a new game universe, not an expansion, made by enthusiasts and experienced RTS players/developers.			"

It does have a slight C&C feel to it (not generals, but C&C, Red Alert type feel).  It plays like those old RTS with some of the annoying features of the old RTS games out of the picture.  (No camp in your base for your super weapon)Like many said it is not a Starcraft so if you expect it to play like that you will be disappointed - there is not as much micro as you would have in SC and the pace is slower.  It feels very well polished, so far the single player campaign in the best I've played in an RTS in years.  It is a bit short, but the cutscenes are plentiful and the story is great.  The three factions are very different as well.  There may be a lot of similar units between them in some regards, but the base strategies differ vastly.If you like RTS games and you liked the old ones back in the late 90's early 2k's pick this game up.

												Status: Campaign as good as finished on Normal, multiple Skirmish (Up to Hard) and one random online match.I enjoy the game for its classic simplicity with modern takes and improvements on the Command and Conquer Formula. I recommend the game to any RTS-Lover and those who want to love the genre. Building a base is easy, understandable and allows for advanced tactics as soon as you get the basics. Units may appear as basic role fulfiller, but I am happy with the choice you have. It appears though as the Goo allows for for crazy tactics than the other factions in terms of units, while the Humanoid races have to rely more on proper base building and expanding. The landscape is beautiful but could use more variation in the future.I approve the full prize and I am thankful for the slight reduction in the Euro price, it shows that some publisher actually care for the conversion rates. Everyone who thinks it is outrageous to demand a full prize for a full game, but still pays 100$ for an incomplete and buggy game (cough AC cough FC cough), is an idiot. Everyone else who thinks it is too expensive still demands that good developer who worked hard have to dine on instant noodles and cannot afford a basic life standard. While I am happy with the content as it is, I still miss a few things. For future updates and expansions, I'd like to see the following:- A proper Stealth mission! Also, more dedicated no-base missions. Maybe as side-missions for the campaign?- An actual in-structure mission! I can still remember the silo mission in Red Alert where you launch a devastating dog avalanche against Tanja.- As stated already a more diverse landscape. I know the classics had two at most, but as of today a bit more variety is welcome.- Maybe the reintroduction of a ranking system for units? I grew quite fond of the little rank markers on units and was always sad when an Elite-gunner died...- A little less durability for Beta walls.tldr:Good game, gonna wreck PvP soonTM.			"

												I'll get my only con out of the way first.  The name Grey Goo actually had me question paying 50 dollars for a new game.  I know what the name refers to, but I really feel that with all the other spectacular work put toward the game, a better name could have been agreed upon.  Onto why I feel like writing a review.  This game is gorgeous.  Even the character designs during the cutscenes look great.  The world you play in looks alive.  And a cool cover system is in place by having overhead forest canopy that blocks you from enemy sight so you can spring an ambush. Playstyle is very similar to Command & Conquer and Warcraft 3.  Easy to learn but difficult to master.  At least from my experience.  Other more proficient RTS gamers may find the game too easy.  But I do recommend this game to all levels of players.  If you have the money to spend on a new title, it would be well spent on this game.  I wish the name was different, in fact I passed over the game at first based on the name alone.  I'm happy that I gave it a second look.			"

												First off this game is AMAZINGLY polished. You won't get any of this unfinished/beta/alpha crap. The graphics are very good. Gameplay is smooth for me even in high unit battles.This game is a throwback to the Command & Conquer days with its own twist. People who don't enjoy the fast paced nature of Starcraft 1/2 and like to spend more time strategically planing instead clicking all over the place then this game may be up your ally.This game is by no means easy just because it is a more laid back RTS. Several missions I struggled with on even Normal difficulty, and I like playing Starcraft 2 campaigns on Hard and above.You don't need to fill up your refineries with worker units. They auto produce resource haulers as necessary. This makes defending what you own much more critical. Unit production buildings can have more than one unit set on repeat so it cycles building to what you define making setting up army compositions very simple.The Tech perks you select really define how you choose to play each game. For example. A Lancer(Humans) fires a channeling beam that does more damage the longer it fires without stoping. Sound Familiar? Well you can select an upgrade that transforms its weapon into a railgun that travels a set distance and pierces targets damaging every unit in its path. So you need to decide if you want a building killing mega beam, or a light unit shreading Rail-of-a-Good time.The exception to many of the things I have listed is the Goo faction. They have a much diferent playstyle that involves no permanant buildings. instead you have a Mother Goo(Mobile home base of sorts) that grows in size as it absorbs resources and units. You then split the Goo up into smaller sizes and morph them smaller ones into units and such.All in all each race feels likes its own. Some of the early units feel generic, but that changes when upgrades and more advanced units come into play.There are a few things I would like to see implimented. When you fail a mission they should prompt you to restart without making you load back through 2 other screens and have to reskip the cutscenes(which are awsome btw). There are a few other things I had on my brain but I lost them. Nothing that really detracts from the games enjoyment for me.I'm hoping to see expanded campaign content in the future.-Gui			"

												is this good? no... I would say good... This is one of the best rts' i have ever played a starcraft like game with massive variations between the forces. Goo are the most offensive early game with the mother goo being an amazing first assault unit winning games almost instantly. The beta are the humans of this game (they are the least tech impressive race) relying on a very powerful epic called the hand of ruk to destroy large forces very quickly. And we have the humans who, ironically for a sci-fi game, Are absolutely amazing. They can teleport forces, build the strongest defences and ,more amazingly, Build a mech with a deathray. Humans<goo<beta<humans is how my games usually result as.			"

												Who would rate this bad???The good:1. The factions are wildly different in game style (don't see that often in RTS).2. Campaigns are very interesting and tell a decent story.3. Trees can cover your units (this is really fun to ambush an enemy).4. LAN mode play and INTERNET play or very good single player. 5. Never a boring monment, units are nice, its not the easiest game.6. You can build your entire base and units.The bad.1. Maps don't support large players.2. Larger maps would be my must have for a Grey Goo 2 or beyond.3. Team play is wierd, just let people team or not, not sure why this is a sepearte game type, but not a horrible option.I don't understand any negative reviews, I'm not sure why it would get anyting but positives. It has a few bad things but its good outweighs every single bad part.  If you liek Red Alert and games where you have control and don't wanna micromanage everything, this is a FANTASTIC game.  "

												The pro's of this game:-Great faction design each race is unique to the genre and offer interesting game play.-It is extremely well balanced.\-terrain design in the maps and how tree's can work to set up ambushes are also really well thought out.- The developers show a lot of love for the game. For example they released what was essentially an entire expansion (update included a new race and new units for each faction) for free.The con's:Game play is really slow. Honestly just increasing the game speed just a little bit would help a lot to make this game more exciting.The resource system is extremely dated and unoriginal. We've seen similar if not identical systems in other RTS games, and honestly I think it is the one thing holding this game back.Regardless this game and the company behind it are worth a look.

												I heard some stuff that didn't sound too great when it came out, so I held off on getting it.Beat the campaign recently and am delighted to say that some of the criticism was unfounded(Particularly that about uninspired unit design).I must say, this seems to be Frank Klepacki's best sound track yet. Although the Goo's orchestral dubstep mostly lacks the things I consider the best of both worlds. The Beta and Human tracks, however are by far my favorites yet.This certainly feels like a slower more deliberate game than your starcrafts or C&C titles, and I like that about it. There's still that feeling that certain situations are ""supposed"" to be solved with particular rock-paper-scissors combos, but this game has a nice way of mixing it up with the tech system, allowing some wiggleroom for your favorite units.The Goo as a faction are unlike anything I've ever played in an RTS before, the closest facsimile I can equate are the Heirarchy from Petroglyph's innovative yet ill-fated Universe at War: Earth Assault, but even that doesn't describe it adequately. They aren't such heavy hitters, and rely heavily on hit-and-run tactics to attack effectively.Overall, if you're aching for a new RTS, pick it up, I wouldn't recommend it if you have a personal favorite right now you couldn't go without.

												Great story, fun campaign, love the factions, but the multiplayer is dead. And when this corpse occasionaly rises, it has the face of Goo. You literally cannot beat the Goo faction in multiplayer. By the time you might have just gotten a base up and running with either of the other two factions, the Goo has already spread to the rest of the map and has an army at your door. If it were just the human and beta factions or those and a third similar faction, the multiplayer would be awsome. But like it's namesake, the multiplayer of this game is entirely dominated by the Grey Goo.			"

												As everyone is saying a great throwback to the old C&C style RTS games.The UI is very well thought out and then done very well too. Almost everything of importance you need is under a few QWERT clicks if you need to build anything, might get a bit getting used to but once you got the hang of it, it's very fluid and feels very natural. I find it fun t see the Humans be the most advanced race for a change. You don't see that often in sci-fi and was fun to see something out of the norm on that. Most of their units are AI drones.The Beta are an alien race less advanced, and you start the campaign with them. Both them and the Humans play rather similar even if the Beta are less exposed to AOE attacks, which the various epic units, especially the Goo's and Beta's are good at.the Goo really do play differently, they are like nanomachines. Sort of like the zerg from Starcraft but then self replicating nano machines. They are grey and form large blobs from which they build their units. Hence the name of the game. They are the Grey Goo.The Single player campaign is engaging and has a good story. And the vids that tell the story are extremely well done, with great voice acting too.However. It is a rather short campaign. All told, about 15 hours long. Took me a bit less.The AI can put up a fight, depending on how you like to play yourself. Myself being more a defensively minded person, it can be a bit tricky at times as the general rule of thumb seems to be to take the offensive early on and get as many resource hubs as you can as quick as you can.I like how you have to make certain choices in what tech skills you're gonna go with. But... Having said that... Some of the tech skills just seem to be alot better then the other potentials in the group. Basically. All 3 races have 5 grups of tech skills and every group has 3 choices in them. But you can only ever choose one in each group.But some of the choices jjust seem so much better then others. For instance. All 3 races have an anti-air land unit. But all races have a skill to make it so that that unit can also attack ground forces, making that unit immediately much more viable and important. Especially as it's usually a rather strong unit too.But this is more a balancing issue they should be able to patch out in the future. It is not a big thing and doesnot detract from the game.Where the game does lack is in the Skirmish and Multiplayer mode. Note that as I write this, I have not yet had time to try out multiplayer. But seeing problems that I do feel should be mentioned for people that want to do multiplayer. For now too few maps, but that will get better in time, so not a long term issue. But needs to be mentioned that they could've added a few more with a bit more variety in them nonetheless.The AI oppononent can make it tough on you. But depends on how you yourself play. My advice against the comp is to be agressive. Just keep pumping out units and take as many resource nodes as you can. Especially with the humans this is no problem, as the harvester building is safe in your camp and the extractor is free of charge with that so you can rebuild it whenever you loose a node.In multiplayer... The humans have a huge weakness that will be exploited. All their buildings need to be connected to powerlines. Which can be destroyed too easily. Don't get me wrong. You'll loose quite a few troops to this, and you can make make tech upgrades to mitigate this. But when the Epic units start hitting the field. This will be a huge problem to Human players.The betas are much less vulnerable to this as their bases are much more spread out. Having said that. the Humans defensive structures probably still are the strongest in the game. For the rest these two play very tradionally.The goo don't have buildings and are far more mobile. And their goos from which they build their units can all traverse mountains that other normal Beta and Human forces can't cross. As I said above the best analogy I can think up of as I type this is that they are like the Zerg. Even if zerging might not be the best tactic from the start. All of their units I think are less powerfull then the others units. So you need numbers with them to win. Still... Harassing attacks will do wonders with them. As I said. The Umans might have a large weakness. I'm not sure how it plays out in Multiplayer. But I hope it won't be too bad and if it is... Then I hope that the devs can do something to balance that issue better.			"

												This game is great. I have just finished the campaign and yet to play multiplayer.With that in mind, I really enjoyed it. The story is thought-provoking. You think one thing, and then it changes. The universe they have created is very alluring, however they leave a lot of gaps that I want to know which will probably be answered in future games or DLC.[Spoilers]Where did the Beta come from?Are the Beta the only ones with the ability to send ships through the keyhole?When the humans came through the keyhole, was this their first time going through one? The story says they could only look through them. When they traversed the stars, how did they do it? Did it just take them thousands of years?The Goo probe they sent, was that through the keyholes or did they travel at light speed around the galaxy?How did the Goo evolve?Who are the silent ones? Was the Goo the enemy the Beta have been fighting for generations? The end makes that unlikely.Was the Beta humanity's first encounter with intelligent life?How did the Goo get to Ecosystem 9? The campaign was very disjointed. Beta first opened a keyhole and humans came through. They fought them until something came burned up in the sky and crashed. When that hit the planet, Goo came into the picture. However, later in the campaign, it was revealed that it was the Human's main ship that crashed as a result of a Goo attack. They said the goo came from a sample on the planet from one of 2 lifeforms they were fighting. But, the Goo were not encountered until the ship had crashed. Something is missing here.How did Singleton survive and is he now part of the Goo, or was he working with it from the beginning?I am okay been left in the dark about the silent ones, but it would have been nice if they explained and filled in the gaps in the story. Lastly, how long do we have to wait for a new game? I need more.[End Spoilers]I do not undersand why the game does not perform that well. If you max out your unit cap and put them all on screen, it begins to lag. Even with and R9 290 and a Core i7. Graphics are not that great. It looks good, but not amazing. Commando's hands for instance are just these low polygon blocks. Many of the units are very simply shaped. The goo is the only ones with complex geometry. Something needs to be fixed as I hate the small unit cap and the limited players per map.			"

												A throw-back RTS with some really nice factions that bring new ideas and play into the genre. The goo is very unique faction, and the beta and humans are both fun. While relatively simple, it has enough layers to keep gameplay enjoyable. With a little balance (Artillery seems a bit strong right now), it could really shine. Give it a chance, and you might be impressed if an old school RTS is what you want.			"

												There are a number of things that I liked about Grey Goo. Amongst them are the variety of buildings and units between the factions, cover terrain, and over all graphics. The story line, plotting, and back drop are also unique. Yet, even with seven hours into playing I still can't say that this is a game that I could love. Compared to Starcraft it sems rather small in scale. It's challenging, yes, but the campaigns are short; the majority of the replay value is in the multiplayer, a function that I'm not particularly interested in. There's no reason that I can not recommend this game, but it's not something that I will spend dozens of hours on.			"

												Grey Goo is an unusal RTS gem from the studio Petroglyph, makers of Star Wars Empire at War. Playing much more like a C&C game of ages past than the usual starcraft clone, GG has 3 factions that are centered less around micromanaging and more around tactics and war. Wether you want to LITERALLY eat your enemies as the Goo, turtle as the betas, or play as the enigmatic humans, this is the game for you.			"

												Simply PutGrey Goo is a crowning achievement to the RTS genre, and a must-have for fans of strategy games. The narrative is excellent with stunning cinematics, and the gameplay either online or offline is certainly worth your time. This is a wonderful step back into the glory days of RTS games for myself, and for those wanting to try it for the first time, it will not disappoint.			"

												This title is a throw back the the classic RTS genre define by the original Westwood team. A classic RTS with amazing cutscenes and units with plenty of character. Each race plays differently enough to give you a slightly different experiance. If you're a fan of the RTS genre and looking scratch that old school itch, buy it. If you're a fan of RTS but aren't sure about this title, wait for a sale.			"

												Ok first of all let me say that this game is awesome I love the gameplay, The cutscenes are beautifully rendered and intresting, and all 3 factions have different playstyles. This is games mechanics are a great return for those who played the old classics like C&C and Dune.Pros-WALLS!...but seriously walls that actually do something like keeping the enemy at bay and not crumble in like 2 seconds-3 unique factions that play completely different-You have the freedom to play this game however you like at your own pace.-UI is well done and easy to understand-Economy is simple so you can get straight to the fighting.-Graphics are beautiful for an RTS-An RTS game not made by EA or Sega lol -in game encyclopedia for learning all aspects of the gameCons-framerate seems to be a bit wonky at times. Running this game with a GTX 760 oc but framerates drop at the lowest to 30 fps after playing a long time...-only comes with about 8 maps at launch-those looking to play with 8 players at a time will be disappointed since max is 4 playersWith that said the game is awesome and well worth your time and hard earn cash.

												The game has very nice cinematic scenes and good music, but the mechanism is really unpleasant. Control is quite messy and overly simplified, and lots of very basic control keys cannot be adjusted by default or simply just doesn't exist. These include:1. Reverse move2. Select all same kind of units in sight/across the map 3. Select all units across the map; in game you can only ctrl+A units in sight 4. Formation move↑ which are all very important and oftentimes considered basic keys in RTS games. Without them it just became lot more troublesome to handle. When you find your units scattered everywhere on the map, the only way to rally them is to circle them one by one and direct them to a certain location...and without formation moves, your units, having difference in speed, would rush into places in a line of mess. Reverse move is also important to avoid losses and unnecessary sacrifises which I don't understand why didn't developers add it.The grouping of this game is also a mess. You can actually group same units into different groups, which bring lot of trouble when dispatching them to different locations. With the absense of selecting same kind unit hotkey at the same time, grouping unit and attack has become a terrible experience. At the meantime, you found the game actually does have rules of paper scissor hand, seeing some units are more effective against some else. But without even a key to group same unit, this mechanism itself is totally useless.The game's pace is rather slow...I don't feel it bad but honestly it is slow enough to make you feel angry. Building a least tech intensive Beta infantry requires 15s, a predator tank 45s, an artillery unit 1min+, and a tech upgrade takes 3min, epic units take 5min...All units run slow too, which largely obliterates the fun of having them hovering over the field.    The tutorial is also quite disaappointing. It didn't tell much about which button to hit, how to build anything, what is the limitations to build something. You just have to watch videos online or figure out yourself.The campaign is relatively rushy works. Campaigns should be designed for players to get familiar with the game's basic mechanisms. This game doesn't feature many units already, but you would be asked to learn how to use nearly all units within a handful missions. In the first mission you only have tier 1 units to build, but in second mission you just suddenly get all tier 2 and 3 ground units unlocked including tank, siege vehicle and artillery. In third campaign you would unlock ALL air units, which all have different combat roles. In fourth campaign you would start building epic unit...But how could it be useful? The missions are not even long enough for you to fully explore each unit's potential. Comparing to RA2, RA3 and CNC3, those classical RTS games feature way lot more units, but you are getting no more than 2 to 3 new units in each new mission, which is highly helpful for you to gradually adapt to the game's play style. DLC worth that cheap expenses. The three campaigns are really great and features really classic feelings. But developers probably forgot to put the play soundtrack button in the control interface. To listen OST you have to open music files in folder or open via steam, but you can't open it in game, which doesn't make sense.The voice cast of units is rather disappointing too. The Beta units' voices sound so stupid that you can hardly imagine they are quite advanced alien species, with that foolish accent. Meanwhile, the Goo...that was purely noise. I really hope the developers of this game make some aggresive adjustments on its currently unfriendly mechanisms to attract more players. At least add some basic hotkeys.			"

												Grey Goo is the closest thing to StarCraft II without actually being StarCraft II. The best part of it is playing as the Goo faction, because they have no ""buildings"" -- all their stuff moves. This makes even a moderately skilled Goo player nearly impossible to kill. Which means that the Goo faction is not fun to play against for the very same reason. Tracking down every last goo after having broken any serious resistance can make games drag on, and somewhat harms the pacing of the single player campaign, until you get to play as the Goo faction and then it's awesome.The games feel a little slow compared to StarCraft, but the units are clearly distinguishable visually so you will be able to get a pretty clear idea of what's happening, which makes Grey Goo far above most other StarCraft clones out there. (I'm looking at you, Achron!!)The developers of Grey Goo are real good guys and deserve your support. They added an entire fourth faction to the game long after release FOR FREE! That shows some real Blizzard level dedication to post-release support, and ultimately that's what Grey Goo seems to be at it's core: a well-executed Blizzard fan game.So my conclusion is: Get StarCraft II. Play all the campaigns of StarCraft II. And if you are still wanting more StarCraft II after exhausting all the StarCraft II content, then Grey Goo is totally your jam, son.			"

												Grey Goo Is a good game but there is nothing which makes it shine above the rest.Overview The playable races have already been done with Earth 2160 so there's nothing new here.Unit training I found to be rarther slow in comparrison to damage output of units, so if people are attacking your base with a lot of troops and you don't have many to defend, then you're pretty much done for.The Epic units are units which pack a punch and make enemy units go bang via 1 hit kill. The Epic units take up 70 units of your population cap which is around 40% and I found the population cap of 200 quite low.PerformanceFor the most part the game performance was flawless with only one issue.I suffered from some serious FPS Drop only when hovering over units pop up descriptions which reduced the frame rate to less than 5, which soon shot up to normal (60+) once deselecting the unit.SummaryDespite its little flaws, the game is enjoyable and is by no means a bad game.However Don't expect epic scale battles on huge maps as the population cap and small map sizes really hinder the game.

												Grey Goo has an interesting story line and stunning visuals. gameplay takes a midrange learning curve. The campaign  is entertaining but I would say it has low replayability. This is on the same level as Starcraft except the goo is relatively weak - overall I would wait for this game to go on special before buying. I was disappointed overall - would have liked to see a more intense storyline.			"

												This is without a second thought, the most unique Real-Time-Stratergy game I've played since Starcraft 2 and its awsome expansions (Heart of the Swarm & Legacy of the Void). Although this game will never be as perfectly designed as what Blizzard has created, this game is epic and one of my all time favourites! The Pros:Four unique races that (In my opinion) are well balanced. The Humans force consisting of solely AI units. The Beta are more 'Human' like in regards to current day civilisation, with mechanised vehicles, ground soldiers with a great construction coverage of the visible map. The Goo consist of nanobots that can replicate fast and formulate into uniquely designed units. Once having established a foothold on a harder difficulty, they a near-impossible to eradicate as their expansion rate is rapid. Last but not least, the Shroud. They are a mysterious race that are hellbent on eradicating all life in the universe, as if they are trophy hunters, (In some regards, I think they are exactly that). Awsome to play as and verus.The Cons:Multiplayer is at times, quiet and dead, but there are thousands of active players playing by themselves. The Frame-Per-Second can drop considerably for a short duration whilst there is large AI/User activity on curring during matches. Conclusion: This is an epic RTS that needs to be avalible in hardcopy for purchase to help boost the playerbase. Rating: 8.5/10			"

												Great start to possibly revive the RTS genre and for this company, Good to see a decent RTS coming out again after EA somehow found a was to mess up C&C.. Theres a lot to improve on before this game can rival C&C and the name reaally needs to be changed before a sequeal is made, I really dont mean to be mean about it at all cause the game is great and being a C&C veteran, This game is exciting and is making me relearn how to play this RTS, But I cant just go tell my friends hey you want to go buy and play this game called ""Grey Goo"" with me? Otherwise great game so far and given it can get more support from the community I believe it can become a huge game but the new games that come out for it should be revamped with more features, better graphics, etc, the normal stuff of course for games, And if the name was changed and maybe the tedious in game Gui changed up a bit, Then thatd help a ton in my opinion. Id recommend buying the game, Not sure if its worth 30$ yet but I digress, I cant wait to see what is going to be done with the game later!			"

												Recommend with a caveat.TL;DR: I recommend buying this game on sale if you have other friends who want to play it.  $50 is steep and a tough time finding online players are the main negatives.  Also, disconnects happen too frequently, but that can be fixed if the devs get their butts in gear.This is a decent RTS.  However, it is hampered by two things. 1) Too many disconnects which haven'tbeen fixed yet. 2) Lack of online players.The game play is definitely economy bound.  You have to watch your economics closely in order to build the right units at the right time.  Good micro helps in a pinch, but the macro is what will make or break you.  So if you like RTSes where micro is the definining factor, you may not like it.The ""Goo"" class is a nice innovation.  The other classes have to hunt and destroy because Goo has no HQ in one place.  This makes for some tough tactical decisions, including for those playing Goo.The AI is hard in campaign mode, but the campaign isn't really compelling.  The fun is in multiplayer mode.The connection issues can be fixed if the devs put their mind to it, so it wouldn't stop me from buying the game.  What might stop me is the lack of online players available.  The initial price was that of a AAA game which limited the number of people who got it right at the beginning.  This limited the number of available players, so it made it hard to get a match going.  Which in turn caused others to stop playing.  So, the pool is kind of limited right now.  If you have other friends who play, though, or join a group where you can set up matches, it's fine.  But if you expect to join the server and get a match going in a few minutes, it will be frustrating.			"

												I would NOT recomend to buy this game. Here is why:LACK of 3vs3 Matches. It's bad, really bad.Maybe you got 2 friend and want to play with them all togheter in a team, and you just can't.There is nothing to say about it, the developers, if they really care about their game should engage to make 3v3 available.Other games has it, and if Grey Goo want to be competitive should add this feature very soon.Second point, the balance.Everyone you find in multiplayer are almost BETA or Goo, let's ask oursef why? Well;Another point Developers should see, is that the Human Lancer is pretty weak. It's point is to be the Human heavy units (as the avalance from Beta) and it only deal 20 damage, then 20, then (after 4 secs) 70. The avalance from BETA has 250 damage (300 is the damage of an epic units and avalance is not an epic unit, I would make notice it to people), almost same penetration (10). It just ONESHOT every enemy unit, the only things that try to limitate it's firepower are the range and the fire-rate, both useless, because you can just shut down the enemy at 1° shot. If you accompany them with anti-air and light is just the perfect army in mid game. The cost are almost the same, avalance cost 600, Lancer cost 560. What I'm sayng is not just my opinion, if you check on multiplayer, there are few people playng humans, and they all rush, and even if they rush NOBODY even makes a Lancer. 20 starting damage is just RIDICULOUS. Even with higher fire rate. A good deal would be if Lancer would get 80 starting damage, reaching 130 over time. If this will not be done, Lancer will never be take seriously, you're better to directly remove the unit from the game. Another thing I would point is that the aoe damage of the alpha should destroy all light units entirely, that's why I would sudgest to increase aoe damage to 125 from 100. Anyway, this is not even needed because nobody uses Epic units in multiplayer. The REAL problem is the Lancer, actually.I would be glad to edit or even delete this bad review, but I will only if the games really change. Unless, it's almost a waste of money for the actual condition.			"

												I've only played single player. That said, I loved the story (nothing really mind-blowing, but efficient), and the gameplay (the difficulty is challenging) is quite compelling. Hope to see more of this, because this universe seems to be so rich that this game feels just like a teaser. Don't get me wrong, although not as extensive as other RTS games, this is a complete experience, it' leaves you with the need for more, in the best way possible.			"

												Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game. I even got it on sale for $20 and I feel a tad cheated. The story mode is extremely short, which wouldn't be so bad but they basically leave you in the middle of the story. It just screams ""Oh well, better get some DLC in the future, right? Wink Wink. Huh? Don't you want to know what happens, come on, give us more money."" I buy DLC to expand on a game, not to get to see the actual ending.Also, the units are all extremely boring. They are the same units and buildings down to the HP, just reskinned with a different name. And none of the units really stood out for me. Beta were interesting at first, but the human forces were uninteresting for the most part, and the goo were just annoying to play by the end. Overall I feel like this game just lacks something major and while I don't regret buying it, I wouldn't recommend it.However on the positive I will say that I haven't ever seen a game with such good visuals. The units and maps come alive and you can see some pretty small details from time to time. And the cut scenes are hands down the best I have ever seen.			"

Classic Westwood style, without the heavy APM requirements to compete in SCII. The Goo is the real game changer here, perfoming in a way I've not known any other faction to play in any RTS I've owned. I'm legit hooked.Casual/Competative RTS players, this game is well worth it and will only get better once all the e-sports add ons come in to effect (game records, spectator mode, more maps etc)			"

												Grey Goo is a game where you shoot at goo because goo is evil and want to take over the universe and turn it into goo. So a bunch of highly advanced humanoids came from ""Earth"" to a planet called ""Ecosystem 9"" or something like that, to stop the gooey menace of society. But to their surprise they found a bunch of crazy alien dudes that were mumbling something about the ""silence"" and attack anyone that looks more advanced than them. So the Goo, Humans and Beta(aliens) decided to settle this conflict as any rational person would, with guns and lasers, marching their armies to their imminent demise because the war must be nourished with mindless violence! Anyway what was I talking about? Oh yeah, Grey Goo, it's a game, an RTS (real time strategy) game, shares gameplay similarity with the Command and Conquer series and Starcraft 2. Is it perfect? I would say no, but is it fun? Oh yes, definitely! It has interesting game mechanics and tends to be more easy with the micro-managment. My score would be 8/10 needs more goo.			"

												A very solid RTS game, the single player could use a better storyline and more cinematics but overall it was a fun experience. Each factions offer a unique enough experience to warrant a deep and engaging gameplay. Though the game isn't without flaws, it's a bit tedious to make different units because sometimes you are forced to build 2 factories to accomodate all the unit types. Units walk a bit slow, which I find unnecessary. Anyway, the game is cheap enough, so if you're a fan of the RTS genre. Don't forget to grab a copy of this game, you won't regret it(maybe).

The wait for a new old-school RTS is finally overDon't be fooled by the name, Grey Goo may be the old-school RTS you've been waiting for. At its heart it's a bit of a mix of Starcraft and C&C3, with enough differences to have easily fought for a place in the crowded RTS market of a few years ago. The question is how much its novelty in 2015 is part of the reasons it's getting some very good reviews?I don't think it's unfair to say that Grey Goo is a bit rough around the edges. The graphics aren't going to push a mid-range PC much, and I did find some bugs with loading and menu screens, however the cut sequences are impressive for a team on a smaller budget and the overall style is classic RTS (in a good way). The three factions comprise humans, the humanoid Beta, and the eponymous Goo. Other reviewers have commented that the former two are quite similar and the latter not great fun to play, but I'm quite liking all three and the more you play the more the subtlties are starting to come out. Also, the Goo is about as different a race as you're likely to see in an RTS and could lead to some interesting tactics in a three-way scrap. The team deserve some real credit here and I'm looking forward to seeing how the factions will develop, but I'd also like a few more skirmish maps to play about with (presumably we'll see both in DLC).    So, to answer my question, only a bit. Novelty value aside this is a fully-fledged RTS with a decent campaign and enough skirmish options to keep single players happy, at least whilst more maps come out, and the asymmetrical set up is going to be great fun for multiplayers. If you're looking for a new RTS and you pick up Grey Goo - and I certainly recommend you do - you won't be be disappointed.  "

												I have played for a couple hours and this is more of my first impressions.I never played earlyier c&c but will probably buy them next time htey are on sale.THe campaign seems solid on the 2nd level i wasnt prepared and was building my units slow nad not expanding i laated about 5 minutes since the enemy constantly was sending troops my way. The 2nd time i learnt from my mistakes and won. I so far enjoy the game but the 50$ doesnt seem fair and was not sure weather or not to buy but so far i havent crashed or had any bugs and the ciniamtics are great! If your considering buying this game i say watch some videos/streams first to see if you like the concept.			"

												A fantastic game. Much of it is reminiscent of games like starcraft and supreme commander. Compared to these games however the three races feel and play entirely different. Each feels truly unique, yet everything feels very balanced.Good campaign and multilayer, the AI is good and has a variety of preset behaviors. There are a couple of issues. The units path-finding can get tricky, as units going opposite ways will try to walk through each other rather than walking around, and there is a rather small pool of multilayer maps (though there is a button for custom maps, so maybe a future workshop expansion).All in all, an excellent, beautiful rts. Well recommended.			"

												Great visuals and attention on details (e.g. when you produce a commando unit in the factory, you see him actually trainning xD). I'm about 3 or 4 missions in the campaign and for now they are pretty diverse in objectives and such. Story wise it is pretty compelling , the cinematics are GORGEOUS and the voice-acting is okay. Gameplay: the hotkey system by default makes it very easy to macro (produce units, construct additionnal buildings, research tech, etc) using Q W E R T to access every menus and sub-menus.

												Great game for classic RTS fans.  Interesting game mechanics.  Story is short, but serves its purpose - to be a tutorial for new players to learn how to get a base up and running as well as how the units work.  Some might be put off by the $50 price tag, but kickstarter-free game development is expensive, and they paid for it out of pocket.  This is one of the best RTS games to show up since Starcraft 2.

												This game is refreshing. Not only does it have a greaa soundtrack and absolutley stunning cutscenes, but you  get to choose what songs you want to play with the Jukebox feature. But onto the meat of the game. Of the three factions, the Beta are fairly typical for RTS games. They are well balanced and spread their bases around the map. This in contrast to the other base building faction, the Humans, who unlike the Beta, build one expanisve well-defended base. Their strategy is typically to turtle and send out waves to wear down enemies and pick off enemy instalments. Now, on to the real pull of this game; the Goo. The Goo are a completely new type of faction that has never been done before in this type of game. Instead of building a base, you start off with one Mother Goo, who, depending on hoe much resources it has absorbed, can spilt into smaller blobs called Proteans. There are 2 types of Proteans, Large ones, which are about as slow as the Mother Goo, and split into heavier unit types, such as tanks. The other type, is the zippy small Protean, which  spawns light infantry. On top of this, Mother Goo and Protean blobs can traverse any terrain, and absorb building and units, making them something akin to melee-range siege weapons. Despite all this innovation, the game has a few setbacks. Despite the campaign telling a good story and having constant and wonderful cutscenes, some of the levels are absolute hell, like the 5th and last Beta level, where after holding out for 15 minutes, you spend an hour running around the map chasing down the last goo blobs. The interface also is very clunky and unresponsive, though a lot of that can be changed by toying with your hotkeys. All in all, this game is just the breath of fresh air the genre needed, from all the Total Wars and Starcraft. 8.5/10			"

The wait for a new old-school RTS is finally overDon't be fooled by the name, Grey Goo may be the old-school RTS you've been waiting for. At its heart it's a bit of a mix of Starcraft and C&C3, with enough differences to have easily fought for a place in the crowded RTS market of a few years ago. The question is how much its novelty in 2015 is part of the reasons it's getting some very good reviews?I don't think it's unfair to say that Grey Goo is a bit rough around the edges. The graphics aren't going to push a mid-range PC much, and I did find some bugs with loading and menu screens, however the cut sequences are impressive for a team on a smaller budget and the overall style is classic RTS (in a good way). The three factions comprise humans, the humanoid Beta, and the eponymous Goo. Other reviewers have commented that the former two are quite similar and the latter not great fun to play, but I'm quite liking all three and the more you play the more the subtlties are starting to come out. Also, the Goo is about as different a race as you're likely to see in an RTS and could lead to some interesting tactics in a three-way scrap. The team deserve some real credit here and I'm looking forward to seeing how the factions will develop, but I'd also like a few more skirmish maps to play about with (presumably we'll see both in DLC).    So, to answer my question, only a bit. Novelty value aside this is a fully-fledged RTS with a decent campaign and enough skirmish options to keep single players happy, at least whilst more maps come out, and the asymmetrical set up is going to be great fun for multiplayers. If you're looking for a new RTS and you pick up Grey Goo - and I certainly recommend you do - you won't be be disappointed.  "

												I bought this game before having a gaming pc delivered. I can confirm that it seems to work fine on a Surface Pro 1 with an intel HD 4000/i5 at 1280x720. Despite everything on low the framerate remains playable and it looks pretty good too. So far I have only played the skirmishes. The game itself is just what I was hoping - a lovechild of CnC, Supreme Commander and Starcraft 2. I found this much more accessible than Starcraft so far and the factions seem fresh and new.The production values are excellent and the interface is fairly easy to get to grips with. I have not read any tutorials, tried the single player or looked online....just jumped right in and it seems easy to learn and fun to play.Is it a better game than starcraft? So far it is more to my tastes and I remain hopeful. If you like RTS games and want something fresh yet nostalgic, I cannot recommend this enough. My initial rating for this game is 9 out of 10.Happy to pay the full asking price and I am most likely going to buy this for my brother so we can relive our childhood.A very happy customer - let the battles begin!!!

												Grey Goo is a game where you shoot at goo because goo is evil and want to take over the universe and turn it into goo. So a bunch of highly advanced humanoids came from ""Earth"" to a planet called ""Ecosystem 9"" or something like that, to stop the gooey menace of society. But to their surprise they found a bunch of crazy alien dudes that were mumbling something about the ""silence"" and attack anyone that looks more advanced than them. So the Goo, Humans and Beta(aliens) decided to settle this conflict as any rational person would, with guns and lasers, marching their armies to their imminent demise because the war must be nourished with mindless violence! Anyway what was I talking about? Oh yeah, Grey Goo, it's a game, an RTS (real time strategy) game, shares gameplay similarity with the Command and Conquer series and Starcraft 2. Is it perfect? I would say no, but is it fun? Oh yes, definitely! It has interesting game mechanics and tends to be more easy with the micro-managment. My score would be 8/10 needs more goo.			"

Its also a laggy pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The devs who made this game seem to have gotten about 80% of the way through making the game genuinely fun, then decided to do something to the game that broke it. What it is, i dont know, but i can guess that it may be trying to connect me online even during single player. I guess this only because i ""lost connection"" to a single player mission thus crashing and losing my progress. This is startling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and when paired with the often unplayable amounts of lag, the game becomes cancer.So despite how much i want to really recommend this fun rts to others, i cant. In fact i suggest you stay as far away from this broken pile of goo as you can. Its an unplayable mess that has given me new appreciation for the concept of a stable single player framerate. I cannot advise you enough, stay away, no matter how good a sale it gets, it will never be worth it, which really sucks because theres a fun game somewhere in there.Also, if you do decide to play it, the human race is trash. play one of the other fun races instead.

 Grey Goo  is a real time strategy game developed by  Petroglyph , a break-off of  EA  that contains many prominent members of  Westwood . Namely for me, Frank Klepacki. Sound 5/5 The music in this game is truly amazing. Klepacki took a risk trying the orchestral music type, and it paid off. He has made other music like this in previous games, like  In the Line of Fire  from  Tiberium Dawn , but that was mere dabbling. The entirety of  Grey Goo's  is in this orchestral style, and it is perfect. The individual tracks really make the game come alive, and they all sound unique.  Grey Goo  reintroduces a mechanic from other games that I love, the jukebox. Letting me listen to the best tracks in whatever order. The soundtrack is amazing, and I listen to it on its own. Design 5/5 The hotkey system in  Grey Goo  is one for the ages. I almost can't play other RTSs anymore because I've become dependent on it. Its fast and sleek. The alien race, the Beta, are so real. They have a distinct culture, and even a language made for them. The cutscenes look so real, its unbelievable. There is much to say about the design in this game, but mostly its just flawless. Gameplay 3/5 There have been a lot of complaints about the gameplay, and I can see why. There are very few unit types, and there is no distinction between infantry and heavy units. Its rather linear to say the least, in a genre that should be more wide. Everything takes so long to make. The game struggles very hard to just stay alive when the unit cap is reached. However, the armour and damage mechanics are quite unique, and the Goo, despite being labeled as an overpowered Zerg ripoff, are very balanced and fun to use. Epic units are plain, unadulterated fun to use. The simplicity of the game, despite being quite the flaw, is kind of refreshing. Story 2/5 Bloody hell, its not a ripoff of  Starcraft , alright? I'm not going to describe the entire story because its quite intricate, and this is a review, not a synopsis. At first glance, it seems rather analagous to  Starcraft , (the Beta are the Terrans, Humans are Protos, etc.) and it does borrow elements from  Starcraft , but it still remains its own. Unfortunately, the story is tattered, and fifteen campaign missions is simply not enough to craft a believable world from. It could be so much more, but its too short. TL; DR Grey Goo is a unique, and refreshing take on the dying RTS genre. It falls a touch short in some areas, but compensates, making a well-rounded game, definitely worth your time. Conclusion Price Worth: 100%Rating:         8/10			"

												NOTE: This game requires a good graphics card and CPU.I played this on a intel i7 with 16 gigs ram and a GTX 1070Personally I had a ton of fun with the single player on thsi game. I had trouble finding multiplayer matches but the singleplayer was tons of fun.The grey goo campaign was one of the most fun RTS that I've had in years. The human units are fun and it's kind of like playing tower defense.But the goo units are really interesting. I love the idea that the goo use health as a resource. Yes, the campaign is ""short"" when compared to other RTS games. So just get it when it's on sale. Or maybe there will be new campaigns in the future. I hope so.			"

												I want to like this game, i really do. Theres some fun mechanics and the single player feels suitably fun* when i play it. Now theres a * and its a doozy. Its also a laggy pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The devs who made this game seem to have gotten about 80% of the way through making the game genuinely fun, then decided to do something to the game that broke it. What it is, i dont know, but i can guess that it may be trying to connect me online even during single player. I guess this only because i ""lost connection"" to a single player mission thus crashing and losing my progress. This is startling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and when paired with the often unplayable amounts of lag, the game becomes cancer.So despite how much i want to really recommend this fun rts to others, i cant. In fact i suggest you stay as far away from this broken pile of goo as you can. Its an unplayable mess that has given me new appreciation for the concept of a stable single player framerate. I cannot advise you enough, stay away, no matter how good a sale it gets, it will never be worth it, which really sucks because theres a fun game somewhere in there.Also, if you do decide to play it, the human race is trash. play one of the other fun races instead.

												Petroglyph made a classic-style RTS and they made it well.I have only experienced a sliver of what this game has to offer, but I am blown away.Pros:- Immersive universe and truly captivating atmosphere- Wonderfully diverse units- Three asymmetrical factions- Old school RTS with some new touches here and there (esp. the Goo)- Fun to playCons:- Low and inconsistent frame rate in the main menu?- Possible framedrops in-game when reaching high population counts (although I have not experienced this first-hand)Verdict:Absolute recommendation if you grew up playing RTS games, despite the (current) technical inconsistencies.

 Grey Goo  is a real time strategy game developed by  Petroglyph , a break-off of  EA  that contains many prominent members of  Westwood . Namely for me, Frank Klepacki. Sound 5/5 The music in this game is truly amazing. Klepacki took a risk trying the orchestral music type, and it paid off. He has made other music like this in previous games, like  In the Line of Fire  from  Tiberium Dawn , but that was mere dabbling. The entirety of  Grey Goo's  is in this orchestral style, and it is perfect. The individual tracks really make the game come alive, and they all sound unique.  Grey Goo  reintroduces a mechanic from other games that I love, the jukebox. Letting me listen to the best tracks in whatever order. The soundtrack is amazing, and I listen to it on its own. Design 5/5 The hotkey system in  Grey Goo  is one for the ages. I almost can't play other RTSs anymore because I've become dependent on it. Its fast and sleek. The alien race, the Beta, are so real. They have a distinct culture, and even a language made for them. The cutscenes look so real, its unbelievable. There is much to say about the design in this game, but mostly its just flawless. Gameplay 3/5 There have been a lot of complaints about the gameplay, and I can see why. There are very few unit types, and there is no distinction between infantry and heavy units. Its rather linear to say the least, in a genre that should be more wide. Everything takes so long to make. The game struggles very hard to just stay alive when the unit cap is reached. However, the armour and damage mechanics are quite unique, and the Goo, despite being labeled as an overpowered Zerg ripoff, are very balanced and fun to use. Epic units are plain, unadulterated fun to use. The simplicity of the game, despite being quite the flaw, is kind of refreshing. Story 2/5 Bloody hell, its not a ripoff of  Starcraft , alright? I'm not going to describe the entire story because its quite intricate, and this is a review, not a synopsis. At first glance, it seems rather analagous to  Starcraft , (the Beta are the Terrans, Humans are Protos, etc.) and it does borrow elements from  Starcraft , but it still remains its own. Unfortunately, the story is tattered, and fifteen campaign missions is simply not enough to craft a believable world from. It could be so much more, but its too short. TL; DR Grey Goo is a unique, and refreshing take on the dying RTS genre. It falls a touch short in some areas, but compensates, making a well-rounded game, definitely worth your time. Conclusion Price Worth: 100%Rating:         8/10			"

Last couple of missions on DLC were more annoying than enjoyable (most of the Goo missions were), but overall really liked this game. It is a great game for a RTS fan,  had all the things that you are looking for and a bit extra with the epic units ;)			"

Posted: January 22
												Before I start let me say that I personally bought the game when it was on sale and the review reflects the price i paid rather than the full price of the game.  I mention this now becasue had i paid full price for this game I could not recommend it and would not be a happy shopper.Grey Goo brings some interesting differences to the table with regards to the factions.  Each faction is well balanced and plays in a different way.  The Beta for example are capable of building anywhere on the map but are the 'least' technologically advanced race.  The Humans (unusally the most avanced tech race) Can build only one base and all the builings have to be connected by conduits leading to some interesting base design.  The Titualar Gray Goo (or Goo) are one of the more unique races i have seen in any RTS they don't have 'bases' as such, however everything is created from 'Mother Goos'.   This brings a lot of variation to the table with regards to  playstyle and you will probably develop you own personal favorite.   Overall i was impressed with the differences in the factions, however, this leads me to the negative about the game. Although the factions feel and play in a unique way there is just not enough variety with regards to unit types.  Every faction basically has 4 light, 4 heavy and 4 air, and a smattering of defensive and one 'ultimate' that's it.   This in itself would be fine If you had a real chance to use them.  What i mean by this is that the single player campaign is just too short for each faction (5 missions for each).  By the time you have access to the complete tech tree the factions story is over.  Now in an rts like Supreme commander where each 'mission' has multiple sub missions a small number of missions is fine.  With Gray Goo however each mission can be completed in under 10mins if you are a skilled player.   If there was a large mutliplayer community this would again be fine, however, it is dead.Overall though I would recommend this game if you can get it like i did for around £7 on sale as the game is certainly worth that money if you are an RTS fan like myself.  If however you are considering buying it at it's full price then i would advise saving your money or waiting until it is on offer again at under the £10 price point.  There simply is not enough to the game to justify the 'full' price or frankly even half the price even if you consider the 'DLC' campaign and fairly unispired soundtrack. To state it again I recommend this game ONLY if you can purchase it at the Sub £ 10 price point. "

												A very solid RTS game, the single player could use a better storyline and more cinematics but overall it was a fun experience. Each factions offer a unique enough experience to warrant a deep and engaging gameplay. Though the game isn't without flaws, it's a bit tedious to make different units because sometimes you are forced to build 2 factories to accomodate all the unit types. Units walk a bit slow, which I find unnecessary. Anyway, the game is cheap enough, so if you're a fan of the RTS genre. Don't forget to grab a copy of this game, you won't regret it(maybe). Sequel when?			"

												A generally good game, however, the skirmish AI difficulty settings seem meaningless. Hard AI's routinely get wiped out by Easy AI's, while occasionally a medium AI will just sit there and do nothing. While the settings for defensive, offensive, etc seem to have some bearing, an AI set to ""balanced"" will assault you with relentless waves of enemies such that they are indistinguishable from an AI set to ""offensive."" In team skirmish mode, your ally AI will rarely if ever assist or cooperate with you, while the team enemy AI's will coordinate exceptionally well, even when set to ""Easy."" I lost my first dozen or so matches against an ""easy"" AI because it was so brutally aggressive.			"

												Summary: Grey Goo has a lot of potential, and its a solid game right now. However, it lacks intensity and likewise replayability. It all comes down to game speed.I've been playing RTS's for a long time all the way back to the first C&C's. It's by far my favorite genre of games. While i respect the choice of slower gamespeed for style of play, GG is a bit too slow. The ability to be quick on your feet with high APM, quick thinking and fast micro is pretty much obsolete in this game. This type of intensity is a huge part of competive RTS gameplay.The units and game mechanics are pretty awesome and well done. Honestly, if everything were the exact same and the game speed sped up to double (yes double) what it is now, it would probably be pretty fantastic. Until then i probably won't be playing too much.There have been network issues and i've been getting dropped from about 1/4 of my games. But the game just released so i'm not considering that as part of my review.Anyway there you have it. The speed does not do it justice, which is a shame because the game is very well made.			"

With 3 factions you basicly make one big campaign split into 3 parts First beta then human and finally the goo.Each mission was challenging, Ones for beta vs the goo.Now for the factions.Im not sure which I like more really The beta are a soild faction with good units and upgradesHumans are quite in the middle, units again being a good mix, but there base building mechnic is alittle broken (take out one power cable shut down buildings)Goo are the most fun and can be overpowered when played right.I wont spoil the ending, But i was alittle disapointed with the ending, but Am looking forward to greygoo 2 with how good this was!Overall i give a soild 9/10			"

Which is very strange as I love playing RTS games on multiplayer.But I do not wish to do so on this one.I will buy this game when my funding improves.

												Yes. Yes! I just took a punt on this because it was a FTP weekend, and I love it. It is essentially supreme commander but with a 200 unit cap and walls. Which is exactly what I wanted. A classic RTS with base building, resource harvesting (and the economy management as a side effect, and defending your resource ), ground and flying units etc. I like that the higher tier stuff unlocks as a match progresses, so you can't just rush a heavy unit at the start. You have to build a unit factory, and a silo, and research a piece of tech before you can build a large unit factory for instance. So the game ramps up nicely into a large scale war without the worry of rubbish rush wins. You still need to be careful though! All in all, I've been looking for a classic RTS like this for a while. If you liked SupCom, you'll like this. It may lack the massive scale of supcom, but it makes up for it beautifully and I never felt that I was limited by the unit cap.			"

												This is not old school RTF! this is more like more Rush game with horrible units (StarCraft clone) and low Frame Rate. $20 dls for this game I think is not worth, for that you can get Command and Conquer collection with 17 games on retail store or $9 dls on EA.com. Old RTF games still better.			"

												A pretty good RTS with a return to form of the older RTS games.Hamstrung by unoptimization and apparently always on DRM.I hear you can turn the DRM off and I highly recommend you do because you can be disconnected from offline single player  and you can suffer lag spikes...In your offline single player game. GREAT!If we look past these flaws then Grey Goo despite its bland name is a return to the days of RTS where you could build a base and turtle up until your ultimate weapon is finished. Unless you play as the goo in which case you seem to lack walls and turrets of any kind but their ultimate weapon in my opinion more than makes up for it. Beta are your C&C style army and humans...Don't play as humans.I would love to tell you more about the game in detail but the constant pausing...Well, it isn't a pause, you see the game still goes but you just can't do anything so often you watch and wait as your units are wiped out and then the game will decide you can play again.Maybe the free weekend overloaded the servers but I expect this from ubisofts uplay not from...Whoever it was that made this game.I guess they are former ubisoft employees?If you can pull out all your internet cables and boot steam in offline mode to bypass the stupid DRM then maybe there is a great game to be played but for the rest of us, its just a major headache that ironically pushes us towards the very thing it was supposed to prevent.Online matches are not worth the offline headache this game makes you endure.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. The game doesn't know if it wants to be CC, startcraft, or it's own game.  Everyone is always going to look at CC because the RTS formula is basically simple and it doesn't really change from game to game, with the expection of company of heroes.I heard this game be desribed as a base builder like CC but the combat seemed rushed like starcraft. I think the main fail of this game is simply the soilders/vehicles. I think there is actually only one soilder in the game, the rest our machine based. They don't have any special fuctions even your artillery can't be force to fire even if you know the other team is there and they are firing at you.SImply put, it's basically horde attacking. You can try to take out anti tank guns with long distance weapons. Whoever has the biggest horde wins. The only semi interesting thing is that if your army gets destroyed more than likely you are finished because units take a long time to make. I feel like this game could have been so good, but it's just not. "

												Heres where I stand, I am presently broke and cannot support this game in my purchase So I will do so with my review.The game is beautiful it has fantastic, unique art work that looks beautiful. The soundtrack suits the game brilliantly, while also remind us of classic westwood and frank klepacki works.I have been enjoying the campagin, It is very well done and quite challeneging at times even on norrmal difficulty.The only major issues I have with this game is I do not feel compelled to try multiplayer infact I fear it... Which is very strange as I love playing RTS games on multiplayer.But I do not wish to do so on this one.I will buy this game when my funding improves. But until then hopefully this will persuade people.I wish the developers petroglyph, the best of luck 1 of the few RTS developers left.			"

												Yes. Yes! I just took a punt on this because it was a FTP weekend, and I love it. It is essentially supreme commander but with a 200 unit cap and walls. Which is exactly what I wanted. A classic RTS with base building, resource harvesting (and the economy management as a side effect, and defending your resource ), ground and flying units etc. I like that the higher tier stuff unlocks as a match progresses, so you can't just rush a heavy unit at the start. You have to build a unit factory, and a silo, and research a piece of tech before you can build a large unit factory for instance. So the game ramps up nicely into a large scale war without the worry of rubbish rush wins. You still need to be careful though! All in all, I've been looking for a classic RTS like this for a while. If you liked SupCom, you'll like this. It may lack the massive scale of supcom, but it makes up for it beautifully and I never felt that I was limited by the unit cap.			"

												I only played the free weekend trial, and I love this game.The cutscenes are amazing, the gameplay is is easy, and fun, and each faction has their own unique way of playing that makes a universal strategy meaningless. If you think you can win as one person, and then succeed as the other? You're wrong. The humans have to be connected, the Beta have limited connections, but can make hubs, and the goo... is the goo.Overall, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

I hadn't played any thing like this since Starcraft, which to be honest got kind of overwhemling with all the available customizations and associated strategies that I finally just hung it up. Grey Goo left me wanting more. Its challenging, even on easy. Some levels you sale through and others mess you up over and over until you finally scrape through it.  The base building system is simple and varies between the 3 factions, Unlike C&C where the opposing forces were mirror images of each other.  I managed to get through the Beta and all but the final level of Human but didnt get to play the Goo. As soon as I get paid I think I will be adding it to my cart!			"

There's only 1 resource in the game, and the amount of units, buildings and upgrades to choose from are too few and don't generate much depth in decision-making. Battle effects feel quite underwhelming as well.(Played during free weekend period, 15-17 October 2015).			"

												Grey Goo is EXACTLY what the RTS genre needs. It brings back the great components of the genre like LAN play, base building, a polished campaign, and heavy macro, while slyly adding amazing ideas like brush cover, MOBA QWER Hotkeys, FOV, and the all-new GOO faction. This game is not a joke - it's an incredibly polished and (most importantly) fun game that you must try. What's incredibly fascinating about this game is that it has the power to appeal to both old RTS fans and younger gamers who have never played this genre. While most RTS games take an eternity to get started with, this game has simple rules. The complexity of Grey Goo truly lies in strategy and tactics, and not in its GUI or micro options. In the interest of comparison, this game took the asymmetry from StarCraft, solid macro gameplay from C&C, some extra components from Supreme Commander, and made it all better.Honestly, comparing this game to the above RTSs isn't even fair. Give it a shot and you'll see for yourself.			"

												Summary: Grey Goo has a lot of potential, and its a solid game right now. However, it lacks intensity and likewise replayability. It all comes down to game speed.I've been playing RTS's for a long time all the way back to the first C&C's. It's by far my favorite genre of games. While i respect the choice of slower gamespeed for style of play, GG is a bit too slow. The ability to be quick on your feet with high APM, quick thinking and fast micro is pretty much obsolete in this game. This type of intensity is a huge part of competive RTS gameplay.The units and game mechanics are pretty awesome and well done. Honestly, if everything were the exact same and the game speed sped up to double (yes double) what it is now, it would probably be pretty fantastic. Until then i probably won't be playing too much.There have been network issues and i've been getting dropped from about 1/4 of my games. But the game just released so i'm not considering that as part of my review.Anyway there you have it. The speed does not do it justice, which is a shame because the game is very well made.			"

With 3 factions you basicly make one big campaign split into 3 parts First beta then human and finally the goo.Each mission was challenging, Ones for beta vs the goo.Now for the factions.Im not sure which I like more really The beta are a soild faction with good units and upgradesHumans are quite in the middle, units again being a good mix, but there base building mechnic is alittle broken (take out one power cable shut down buildings)Goo are the most fun and can be overpowered when played right.I wont spoil the ending, But i was alittle disapointed with the ending, but Am looking forward to greygoo 2 with how good this was!Overall i give a soild 9/10			"

												Finally a really awesome RTS on steam! StarCraft can be so stressful, but this game is just freakishly fun! It's not twitchy like StarCraft.I love the defensive strategies and the fact that the races play so differently than eachother. Also, the concept behind the races I found to be intriguing and the playstyle appropriate for their respective dynamics.One thing I wish was that there were more skirmish maps... I'd like to see more maps that allow the humans more freedom to expand their conduit lines. It'd be really cool to be able to conduit directly into an allies base to build defense structures for them you know?			"

												This is a game that had been on my wishlist for quite a while and I never broke-over and purchased it.  Picked it as part of a bundle deal and I was pretty pleased.  Definite RTS realness with a hint of Starcraft. . . If you like RTS titles, you'll like this one.  I don't see the game as groundbreaking, but there are some nice things about this game that made me really enjoy playing it.  I like the races in the game, I like the universe it's set in, and I do like it does have a semi-decent storyline to go along with it.  If you enjoy Starcraft, Warhammer 40K Dawn Of War 2, Planetary Annilhilation:  TITANS, etc. then you're going to like this one.			"

												I waited until I could pick it up for about £15 because I have been so disappointed with the quality of games last year. Howver Grey Goo is not one of those games. Its a nice modern-day version of all those games you used to love, Total Annihilation, Command and Conquer etc but I think I would compare it most to Supreme Commander.I am about 5-6 missions into the campaign and I feel like I have got my moneys worth. The storyline is so far so good and the FMV's inbetween missions are short enough to keep me intersted and there is enough quality not to disappoint.All in all, so far so good, this game is worth your time!

												It's a nice average RTS. The Goo is a quite new faction in RTS universe, but overall it's still a very classical game : build base, save ressource, go and destroy the enemy. I think the game is lacking charisma. Also not a lot of units per factions, and the AI is quite dumb.Solo campaign is good, graphics and sounds also, but the game is not very deep on the long run.In a period where RTS is a rare genre, Grey Goo is not a bad game.

												As one of the lovers of original command and conquere series I anticipated this game for some time. I got it on second day of release; and just had sometime to finish the game.The plot is a nice modern sci-fi; although they kind of rush through the story so relating to the charachters becomes a bit hard as you do not have enough time to get to know them well.  the goo faction is innovative and interesting to play.The art work is fairly nice but not as detailed as I had hope. But the game developers miserably fail to not make the same mistakes of the current owner of C&C frenchies. The game play in the campain is very random and you hardly know the objectives of several levels. Also the enemy units just get randomly teleported in the game from nowhere in some levels including the very last one!  This is very obvious and annoying as you do not know where to put your defenses or what to expect; I basically saved the game, saw where they got TPed from thin air and loaded back to put up my defenses. These kind of ""little tricks"" by developers make me believe they have done a weak job on designing gameplay. Then they had to compensate by give AI side a boost by having random reinforcements! If there is a battlefield and I have cleared it from all the enemy units by the rules of the game; there should be no enemy popping in my face out of no where afterwards at totally random places.Also original C&Cs were very detail oriented for their time. For instance when it came to battlefield; the traces of war would stay till the end on the field which I loved about them (Man, ""Tiberian Sun"" took this aspect to a whole new level back then). In all recent C&C games and also this one; the battlefield is basically a white board. Yes!  These little details do make a difference in my opinion by making the game more realistic.In short the game is not a horrible one but is the same as one of the recent ruined C&Cs; it falls short of deliverying the original game play feeling. I would wait until it becomes far cheaper before I buy it.Thanks for reading!			"

												While all the media stresses an emphasis on story, decision making and tactics, the campaign is thin and linear. As for the tactics, each faction is little more than a graphical mod of a very simple core design with one or two unique units. The unit cap and cost of units combine to very much *discourage*  building a diverse force with specialized units working to support each other in varied roles and you end up simply building the current faction's unique unit until you hit the unit cap and wiping the map with it. And there is a very clear emphasis on rushing to the exclusion of any other playstyle.			"

												Grey Goo is a horrible excuse for an RTS. The units are remarkably basic. There are no abilities and no interesting concepts. The game is simply build 3 different unit production, and then build a range of units with varying simple stats.. Units are designed to be just hard counters to eachother. Its a game of rock, paper, scissors instead of being a game of interesting mechanics. While playing the game I could not identify a single true redeeming quality. I'm a huge fan of the RTS genre, but this RTS is simply not fun.			"

Posted: February 5, 2015
												Besides graphics and cinematics and sounds, which i leave behind unrated, cause these are no important variables for gameplay to me, I can confirm the designers did a great job creating those three races and their mechanics. As one of them completely differs from the other two in mechanic, there is an interesting balance of gameplay design, still an unbalance in multiplayer gameplay to me. I will let the singleplayer- experience unrated due to lack of playtime in singleplayer.So the multiplayer is what i was after, despitely I was dissapointed fast. The game can simply not compete with genre-siblings like Starcraft, and here are the reasons why I do think so:Ladder: it's just to simple, no different leagues, enormous waiting times (in my experience), high loading time and just 'why'- disconnects from a server are no exception.Sluggishness in control and movespeed: In general, to me, units are just too slow to react with them quickly on an enemies action, or get quickly an advantage in terrain. There is a high imbalance in movementspeed which is completly senseless, cause once engaged, there is no way of rescue any of your units. That genre-important mechanic takes it's killing blow in a, kind of, delayed unit's action. They are too sluggish in turning and firing and moving that you will have no chance to influence combat with micro skills, which is the next point->->Micro-Skill: As a result of the point mentioned above, micro-skill just doesn't exist in a considerable way, that it would alter the result of a combat and thus takes no effect on game. For a RTS the possibility of benefits from microskill is obligatory to me. Thus the gameplay leak options in combat, that doesn't allow to just not watch your army die in a face to face battle. Due to a leak of 'active' or, well, at least 'inactive' skills of your units you get in sum around zero options to affect micro-gameplay. There are no 'active abilities' or 'skills' and that is not the point. That isn't the bad thing about it. It just doesn't support micro-acting, you understand.->Makro-Skill: The overview of buildings, units and techs is very simple and get's you into the materia quick- which is a pro. Developers made a good job here. But... the diversity of options in builds and strategies and chances of reactions on enemies acting absolutely suffers from it. Having no options or alternatives left rather than just waiting for units to finally finish (they are structured for hours...) or believing in hope that everything will be fine when both armies engage like monkeys throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥at each other.So: very restricted variety of options in general. Commonly, and thats even worse, your are forced to 'push-through' a build without reacting on the enemies acting, cause you just haven't the chance to. Due to lack of fast scouting-methods and thus no awareness of what's your enemy is planning you will have no else chance. At the point you can find out your enemies strategy it's far too late to react appropriate on it. All in all it's just a count of army-size controlling early-, mid- and lategame.Economy: no way to get an influence here beyond making the decission when to come up with more refineries/mothers. It's just auto-collecting. KKND2 had a 'more complex' economy mechanic.Maps/Terrain: The maps are well designed, that is out of question, but they do not provide many possibilities of tactical maneuvers, except for Goo, which can climp hills and ledges without penalties, making the map itself a factor for unbalance. Another interessting mechanic are treepatches (or however i shall call them), which I personally think it's a great idea- in theory! In practise the idea isn't well reflected as I noticed fast. Units in there are invisible to enemies outside, making it impossible for you to get close to it, if you don't want your army seeing crushed without chance of counteracting. In add it's very difficult to get these postions spotted. Definition of imbalance.All in all, the worst thing about Grey Goo after the first look is the leak of options you have in multiplayer, making it a 'low-click' experience which will get boring quickly. There is potential in the game, but who knows if rerolling mechanics will bring desired results. Therefore i don't recommend Grey Goo in connection with it's insane price of 46€ for far too less content.Edit: There are several must-have mechanics missing in multiplayer:-3vs3/4vs4-observermode-replays (very important imo)-gamepause-rejoin function			"

However, many of my favorite things about RA2 are absent here.  The creativity of the units, the ability of units to rank up, the humor suffused throughout the whole experience.  I played until the Goo campaign to finally make a judgment since that race seemed to be the most interesting of the three, but playing this was just a tedious and boring time.			"

												It was a close call as to whether suggest this game or not, and to be honest still on the fence about that. Here's why, for the price of 32.99 CAD you get a VERY short campaign spread through three races. For another 8.79 CAD you get a whopping three more missions. . . . Wait wtf? only three missions for what is often the price of full games from indie studios? That said I'm going to compare this to Starcraft 2. While some may say that is unfair, Starcraft 2 is one of, if not thee, king of current RTS's. So this should be compared to a leader in it's field. Unit selection per race is a little limited, but decently balanced. Though with keeping to the united limit of 200 that Starcraft uses and has used since the first starcraft in this game it really limits you as these units tend to take up more space with their ultimate units for each race taking up a whopping 70 slots. . . Compared to Starcraft where the Thor, arguably the Terrans ultimate, costs 6 and you find yourself deciding on a large army or one major unit and ten ok units. . . The species of the goo, which is a nanite species similiar to replicators in Stargate, was a neat idea, even if resembling the grey creep that zerg build everything on. And having similarites to the zerg in that they are the weaker faction but make up for this with regeneration and fast numbers. I feel like it was a near miss for this species though as what you would imagine from seeing in many sci-fi movies and shows doesn't always fit. Almost like they had more than one person Leading development for this race. While some do a damage that break down enemies on a microscopic level others do not. Also when they break down an enemy it leaves a goo puddle behind which is really cool and uselfull, if you have a mother goo closest to it out of all the formless goo. I say mother goo because any of the formless will attract the goo puddle after testing: The Purger will take endless amounts of puddle but will not heal or gain any benefit. . . Well yay that is a waste. The small and large proteans heal a micro-fraction of their health that you may as well not bother seeing as these two units are always weaker then the units they can make that it's pointless and has no benefit to keeping them as proteans. I think it should have worked more along the lines of small proteans if they gather enough puddles become a large protean and large if they gather enough become a fully charged mother (the latter option being harder to do as their is a slot limit to how many mothers you can have, which I understand since they don't take up unit slots and can be used to attack.) I also think that all units of the goo should break down enemies. Seeing as no matter what they are firing it is still made up of nanites which would get to working breaking down an enemy. then as the puddle slides towards a mother goo (only a mother goo) any unit it touches that requires healing it heals slowly diminishing itself along the way, but only if the unit needs healing. Easy way to impliment would be a puddle has a set ""health"", say 400. As it touches things subtract the amount healed from it's health then if any is left by the time it hits the mother bam add the remaining. To help balance make the goo have less total health or do less damage and add a dot to all (though make sure the dots stack otherwise multiple units are pointless) or even both. If you want me to go further into details I can edit this and push on, just this is long as it is, and afraid I'll get a lot of TLDR as it is.			"

												Its a pretty average rtsGameplay 5/10Its got the core mechanics down, building is a little awkward for humans when trying to get all the attachments for big factories. Epic units are game changing as they should be, skill cap for each race is different as well. Overall nothing great about this game just average.Campagin 6/10The story was pretty good, it was interesting, the lvl designs are a bit unbalanced and the triggers for events are exploring so you basically turtle till you hit pop cap.DLC 2/10For 8 dollars (almost 1/3 the price the entire game) for 3 maps that provided little story we could just figure out and not very well designed lvls. It was a huge let down for me.Overall 4/10Due to price, dlc and nothing in particular tha really shined, most of the game was average or slightly above. For RTS outdated games such as C&C zero hour, Frozen throne or sins of a solar empire personally are much better. C&C generals with limitless variety if you use the shockwave mod (basically doubles the content). Frozen throne for extensively in depth story, custom games and gameplay. Sins of a solar empire for gameplay and the many ways you can achieve victory.End of the day its a medicore game that shows promise but feels like it was lacking some budget to push it from average to something worth noting. I was actually hyped to play this game but it did not turn out as well as I had hoped.			"

												Sigh... I just return to good old CNC then. Liked the epic unit idea, some details when moving units as group (second type of units saying something like ""assisting"" or ""additional firepower ready"") and aircraft combat is actually effective - specially Human faction. Everything else failed. Since I really tried to like this game and played it over 20 hours I going to write a more about it:Multiplayer is basically spam of Tier 1 units. Most campaign missions can be completed by finding AI exploit (normal difficulty) and it's not hard at all. Also this game must have the worst implementation of dynamic music at all. Example: Calm music is played during expansion base time and suddenly get stopped and nothing is played.  Then one small scout unit approach wall surrounded base and get shredded by 3 commandos - 180 APM music is played like it's some sort of battle of two epic army and 5 second after calm quiet time with no music return. Cringe worthy missions post screen.Bought it at low price, haven't big expectations and I am still disappointed. This game makes me appreciate more THE COMMAND AND CONQUER ULTIMATE EDITION on Origin. Crate power up's on skirmishes with various effects and buildings capable to counter early attacks like NOD triple Shredder Turrets and automatic vehicle repair near factories in CNC 3 or any stuff in CNC 2 - both fractions have EMP cannon, GDI has grenadiers, NOD has cyborgs and in expansion - the reapers. Hell in CNC 3 simple infantry could build bunker by its own.Small note: About campaign stupid AI  - similar issues I've seen in demo (prologue only) version of SC2 Legacy of the Void. ""Oh seems invisible unit like Dark Templars are attacking my outpost? I just accept my fate and let them die."" (Normal difficulty too) "

												SHORT VERSION:  Game's dead, guys...Move on and get something else, Dont buy.LONG VERSION: A pretty good RTS from some of the veterans of the genre. The campaign is well done with some really nice CGI scenes and a good all-round story, nice visuals and game mechanics overall. However, we play Real Time Strategy games nowadays for the multiplayer, which Grey Goo has of course.A shame then, that the multiplayer portion of Grey Goo is now essentially dead. It started out with a player-base of about 2750 people worldwide on launch. The current average player-base at peak times is now around 70.. 'worldwide'.That combined with some MAJOR issues, like the dev's inability to fix multiplayer lag ( which is probably one of the reasons all of the players left ), The crazy price tag ( I mean, I've got 70 hours on record, and I still think it cost too much ) Like, the only other RTS at that price is Starcraft 2.... obviously not going to get grey goo over a storied well looked after series like starcraft for obvious consumer reasons.Other things like lack of maps ( More are comming aparently ), No replays ( which is being added, aparently ), bad unit balance (as in with one Race, you can win by just spamming the same 2 Tier 1 units, since AOE just cant handle them anymore after the latest ""balance update"" ) bad tech balance, for example free repairing of expensive aircraft, or extra harvestor armour, or extractor armour... the armour thing should be combined, with one choice being something completely different from the armour and aircraft repair, its an obvious choice every time.I want to love this game so much, but because of the non-existant player-base and some of the more aformentioned issues, I just cant. I mean, the game is a good as dead, the dev's might as well stop updating and make Grey Goo 2 or something.A sad ""Unable to Recommend"" from me.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really really did, As a huge fan of Petroglyphs work in the past, from Empire At War to their work at Westwood. I gave the single player a shot, and I found myself intrigued by the story, but frustrated with the mechanics and design at every turn. I was going to play it and debate picking it up on this free weekend for 20$, but I came away very underwhelmed. Everybody says this game is more micro than macro, but even the macro is sort of broken. The units are slow, the pathing is terrible, the campaign/single player AI is terrible and units will stray from their posts and get their asses killed (randomly it seems). The build progression is a little broken and unintuitive in various ways and is far too base building and wall building centric for my taste also.Going to wait for this to drop below 5$, because despite all this, I would like some more time with it, I just don't feel like its worth more than that.

It took me longer to save my game at the end of the first level than it did to play the first level.  Then it disconnected from the server during the second level and I was unable to continue... IN SINGLE PLAYER!			"

												Well its was difficult to here, how to evaluate this game.By start the servers did permanent crush and did loose connection.Well after some month they got fixed. So it works properly now.The AI is not even average, just really bad and too easy to defeat.I like this game anyway, you have nice story campaign and its fun to play online the different factions here.I like to play the Goo, this mobile faction and the Beta who can really good build a base.I like to build as beta a fortress with walls and doors, You can place on towers units and its pretty fun defense mechanism.The Epic of the Goo faction is really fun to use. For the first Petroglyph Games = former Westwood Studios managed to make a game with different factions and a balanced gameplay. Its really fun to play it online.Yes it had problems at start, but now works fine.Its really well music here and some new, good and interesting gameplay ideas.They did now really good Improve the AI / Bots. Now the game is a true AAA RTS game.			"

												This game if freaking bullshuvik. The matchmaking is atrocious. I get matched on a first come first served basis. This means I regularly have to play against top 10 players. 90% of the time or greater I'm playing against top 30. How is it any fun when you know you're going to lose before you start a game? Then there are the wait times. Queue times are usually longer then 2 minutes, often between 4:00-7:00 minutes, and occasionally over 10 minutes. The factions are very unbalanaced, with the goo faction being more powerful than the other two. Missing some standard things, such as being able to set troops to attack move when leaving a production facility on the way to a rally point. This means all your troops die without ever firing a shot if someone sets up somewhere along that path (good luck if you get distracted by a big battle). The human faction is almost allways limited to a very small section of the map and can't expand their base beyond that predfined area. I could go on, but I digress. Mostly for me it is the online play. I'm uninstalling it after today and I won't be looking back. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!			"

												Worst game EVER, when it comes to RTS type games!  Even on easy, the game is impossible.  I understand that a game needs to be challenging to keep the gamer coming back for more, but frustration usually ends in broken controllers/keyboards and bad reviews.  Any game that is going to have an AI, should not have stealth technology as an available tech.  Seriously, do you really think the computer ""Doesn't know"" where you pieces are when in stealth mode?  When it's the computer controlling the moves you give to your troops, how is the computer supposed to not see the stealth troops/pieces?  It’s a point and click interface…you select the troops/pieces you want to move/give orders to, select the desired outcome, and the computer carries out your command.  Of course, the player can't see the computer's stealth pieces...  Any way, if you are looking for a game that is just like all other RTS games, this is the one for you.  If you are looking for a game that breaks the mold, look elsewhere.  Glad I got this puppy while on sale…but I don’t recommend this game unless you can get it for $2 (including all DLC).			"

												Personally, I think this is an awesome game. While I wouldn't say it's the best RTS I've ever played, it's definitely up towards the top of the list. The different factions have different playstyles. What works for one, won't necessarily work for the others. And, while I wish the campaign were longer, I very much enjoyed the storyline and concept, as well as the gameplay. 8/10, 4/5, 16/20, 2/2.5, 2384/2980. Would recommend to play.			"

												Definitely give this game a go, simply yet additive. Depending what race you pick sets the tone of the battle field. Try being the humans for a turtle style game play, by building an awe inpsiring base with turrents and force fields. Then plowing down your enemies. Try out the Goo for an agressive guerilla play style by lurking in the shadows till you just overwhelm the enemie with non stop waves of units.I had a few issues with game crashing quite frequenlty and the support team emailed me quickly.In short I should of muddle with it myself before giving it a bad review.  Sorry for that. The game seems to run fine on my SSD not my hardrive.  I dont know why.			"

												This game is borderline unplayable. 95% of the match the game sticks below 15fps, while remaining 5% it does completely fluid 60fps, meaning something in 3D engine/processing is completely broken. Id ignore quick and rare dips to 20 fps, but i cant ignore quick and rare improvement to normal frame rate.  Sc2 and ashes of singularity on max detail work way more fluidly on my machine!

												AI is capable of rushing even on easy and the maps are quite confining. On top of that, research locks itself in (pick one for each category, that's it), and even the construction is restricted to your original area, at least as Humans. The map editor is very limited in function, as well. I wouldn't recommend this, especially not for the required $30.			"

Posted: June 27, 2016
												Do you like classic RTS like Command & Conquer? Then you will most likely also like Grey Goo.Grey Goo is a pretty standard base building RTS, and I don't mean that in a derogatory sense.You have three factions to choose from:- The ""Humans"" construct their base outwards from a core. They can only expand their buildings by building conductors which transfer the energy. Buildings separated from such a conductor cease functioning, so expanding across the map is extremely difficult for the Humans...also you can't build conductors over elevation, which further limits your expansion plans. You can, however, rearrange your base via teleporter. Costs a small amount of resources and time.Units wise the Humans field drones in all variety. They have small attack craft, bigger tanks, even bigger beam or rail gun tanks (upgraded), artillery and pretty good air units, which can be more easily built up than with the Beta faction. Getting started with the Humans is easy pie.- The ""Beta"" are a humanoid alien race, which look kinda funny, to be honest. They build their base by placing ""hubs"" in various sizes, which can support a number of buildings. Expanding with the Beta is easy, you just need to have vision of an area and you can place your hub and expand. They can also place turrets pretty much everywhere. However, these must be manned by units to actually do something. Units are more or less similar to the Humans. They're different of course, but they serve the same functions mostly. They also field artillery and air units. Funnily enough, the aliens in this game are NOT the most evolved life form, heh.- The ""Goo"" are a symbiotic mass of nano machines, endlessly replecating. The Goo do not build bases or defenses. The Goo just use their ""Motherships"" to claim resources, construct units and kill enemies. Expanding with the Goo is at once easy, since you can do so whenever you wish, but also comes with a risk, since you are actually risking your ""base"" while expanding.The Goo also field kind of similar units, but do have a few diversifying stuff like non-attacking taunt units, aoe healers and not a SINGLE air unit, which makes scouting the map a bit more difficult.The game only has 1 resource, the catalyst, which pays for everything. Just like in C&C for example you do not spend your cash at once, but by resources/second. And just like with C&C you have harvesters collecting these resources and delivering them to your base in chunks. They do need a base station, though (think RA 3). And that's really it.The campaign takes you through 15 missions (5 for each faction), 1 bonus mission (Goo) as part of a free update and a 3 mission mini campaign with one of the main characters of the story. The Story...well, it's not terrible, but it's not standing out, either. You won't find too much enjoyment here, I guess. The motivations are sketchy, the cutscenes are very well done, but lack impact. Character animation, however, is superb. Unfortunately, most missions revolve around killing x or y . The bonus objectives could make things more interesting, if they had a bigger impact on the overall campaign (think SC 2, where you have to complete these objectives in order to gather the maximum amount of research credits, etc.).This is not SC 2, this is not C&C. It's its own game. It's good. It could be better. But it's worth giving it a shot.Graphics and sound are pretty good. Sound track is subject to personal taste, but I liked it. Voice is also good. Animation is ok. Performance seemed to suffer a bit from large amounts of units, but nothing severe.All in all, perhaps a 7-/10.			"

I am not fighting against a large group of AI but the game lags so much at solo campaign. I didn't wait to find out if it lags in multiplayer mode. "

Wasted an hour on this mission because I wanted to complete it and move on and it's impossible to complete. The game gets pacing wrong, difficulty wrong, and doesn't respect the players time.

												Great Command And Conquer-inspired RTS fun with a modern touch and 3 very unique factions. Definitely recommended, especially in a time where good RTS games are so rare.+ Great art style and cinematics+ Different playstyle for each faction+ Nice graphics / effects (particularly in death animations)+ Very good UI+ Good voice acting+ Varying upgrades allow for tactical versatility.+ Fast-paced gameplay+ The Goo are awesome and unlike any other faction you've ever played+ Epic units are truly epic+ Good tutorials+ Not too complicated to get into+ Lucy is sexyNeutral = It's difficult to find out what the 'right' strategy or use of units is, but this allows for a lot of experimentation= Story is intriguing, but short. Information is sufficient but limited, it (probably intentionally) keeps you guessing.- Campaign is rather short (only 5 missions per faction)- Combat may feel like 'send your ball of death to wipe out everything' / 'create your epic unit and roflstomp everything', (naturally there's more need for actual tactics on harder difficulties or in multiplayer)- Group movement could be more fluent, some tools to form up your troops more fluently would be nice- Aircraft feels comparatively weak and easy to counter compared to ground forces- Telling certain buildings / units apart can sometimes be tricky			"

												""Grey goo (also spelled gray goo) is a hypothetical end-of-the-world scenario involving molecular nanotechnology in which out-of-control self-replicating robots consume all matter on Earth while building more of themselves, a scenario that has been called ecophagy (""eating the environment""). The original idea assumed machines were designed to have this capability, while popularizations have assumed that machines might somehow gain this capability by accident.""-Grey Goo Wikipedia Page[en.wikipedia.org]That's a pretty good explanation for what this game is, except it's perhaps at a bit later a stage than simply Earth.The story behind the game is that a vast alien technology known as Grey Goo has invaded space and begun uncontrolably replicating itself, creating a vast horde of hostile robotic war machines that ruthlessly attack and consume all other species, both technology, buildings, and the species themselves.Gameplay:The gameplay is a birds eye view strategy style game, a la Warcraft III, Age of Empires, Starcraft II etc. The game features a unique means to creating units, rather than building a 'city', it is profound that you build an outpost, meant entirely for military expansion. As either Goo, Beta, or Human, your job is not to make a safe haven for your populace to live in, but a sturdy, powerful fortress from which to complete your objectives.Graphics:Graphics are, bar none, amazing. Definitely some of the better graphics, and more immersive atmosphere of any strategy game which I am currently aware of.Storyline/Lore:The story is well literated, properly structured, and intriguing. Though there are a few holes as to how and where the goo was made, what the 'Beta' are, exactly, and how the humans got involved in all this, but despite the unanswered questions, the story still has a satisfying amount of content to make for an experience that you wish to see to the end.Pros and Cons:Pros:-The game's graphics are AAA level amazing. This is my opinion while playing on Low settings. I can't even begin to comprehend how good the graphics are on high/ultra!-The gameplay is new, while retaining some of the classic, proven-to-work strategy game UI.-Fun story with lots of Sci Fi to even satisfy the biggest future-buff.-Potential for game expansions and future added content.Cons:-Only 3 races to choose from.-Micro management doesn't exist.-Linear gameplay. Build, attack/defend, win/lose. Repeat.-Demanding graphics. Lower end computers will not run this well.-The price is pretty steep for a Starcraft II clone.Verdict:Despite there being a couple more cons than pros than I can think of, the pros are still bigger, and generally more weighty, than the cons, at least to me.I personally think the game is great, and worth picking up if you got $60 to spend on a strategy game. Although it is 'VERY' similar to Starcraft II, I believe it might end up surpassing it.Personally, I own, and play, both SC2 and GG. And my verdict is that Grey Goo is honestly better than SC2. That's just my opinion. In the end, it's your job to decide for yourself. But if you ask me? Grey Goo is worth giving a shot. "

												First things first: I'm here for the shroud and the goo and I'm a single-player player, so I didn't even touch the multiplayer part.Well, I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed with what I got for the money.Even though the campaign in and on it's own is nice, it's still very short and... let's call it 'on the point'. Nothing special here.I like the ideas behind the factions and to an accepable amout also their execution.On the other hand it's hard to find out the real differences, reasons, pros and cons of the units and how to utilize them correct. Also there are too few missions to learn the units right and at the point where you start to get somewhat familiar with a few uints, you get thrown on the next faction and start over again. In the end I myself just went with what felt the most efficient, like an army of cloaked Daggers in the human campaign.At the start of the game the tutorial at least sort of tryed to help the player understand the mechanics, but that got weaker with the humans, was mostly nonexistent with the goo, and the shroud isn't even playable in the campaign as well as not explained.Another weakpoint is that if you for example want to play, and therefore learn to play, the goo, you have to play through all of the campaign first and can't decide which faction you want to learn specific.And if you want to learn the shroud faction you have only one chance, namely a skirmish match against an AI-idle enemy and crawl through the encyclopedia.Sadly if playing skirmish matches with AI, especially as the shroud, you get immense FPS drops when having the unit/build UI open and moreso when hovering your cursor over the units/tooltips up to the point where the game just crashes.Such technical problems with the game itself are known for long on the forums and no sollutions or patches given officially.The only answers from the staff in the forums to any problems is the explicit demand to fill out a ticket and providing them with your personal data (or data-mining for short).In conclusion, personally I think the game was very promissing but poorly executed and I myself regret spending the ~30€ for the game.If it's on sale fore like 5~7€ feel free to give it a try (if you don't plan on playing shroud) but for the price it's listed at, don't even think about spending.So, I won't recommend it.

												As someone who plays RTS games mostly in a casual way, caring far more about the campaign, the aesthetics, etc. than about competitive multiplayer, I really enjoy this game. So if you're like that aswell, I very much recommend giving it a try. Be warned though that a lot of people seem to have technical problems. I personally didn't discover any though. My only gripe with the game is that saving takes ages for some reason.			"

												Grey Goo looks beautiful and oozes polish in its cutscense and voice acting, but it falls flat with its slow pacing, boring mission design, and restrictive base-building mechanics (for the Humans and Betas; the Goo cannot build structures). The Goo are particularly frustrating to play against, as most battles seem to end in me chasing the last 'mother goo' around the map for 20+ minutes. The units also feel very generic and, since they lack any abilities, Ctrl+A attack moves tend to be the players only interaction in fights.			"

												A nice reminder why the genre is dead, mostly defined by having to babysit a bunch of braindead units:- Artillery shells with blast radius punish tightly packed groups of units. The pathfinder loves to tightly pack your groups of units.- There are natural shelters, hiding your troups from the enemy. Your units are real men and don't do hiding, so you better manually show each unit where to go, lest half of your group remains outside.- You have the option between your units either a) not moving a step, happily watching how your harvesters are blown apart a few meters away, OR b) your units happily approaching single infantry soldiers without giving a damn about entering the firing range of any enemy artillery.- WHY YES I WANT THAT SINGLE UNIT TO TAKE A COMPLETLY DIFFERENT ROUTE THAN THE REST OF THE GROUP.Production values themselves are pretty high, though. Runs well, looks nice enough, voice acting is ok.			"

												A well written Campaign from what I have yet seen in just getting started enough to realize building sequencing counts.  Jumping into games with variations against the AI working on improving my timing verse resources and I found an AI brutal at any level setting but Idle.  As well in single player against the AI there is only build and kill where the first shot counts as well in combat.  One on one as BETA I have not found a way to stand a chance alone.  Humans are easy to get started as they provide near immediate single stage defenses.  GOO has the greatest advantages all the way around in its ability to slip in and off the map at will as a blob.  The rest I will let you figure out!Downside?  The maps are too small and simplistic with extraordinary means needed to bottleneck in the choke points.  Humans are restricted to start location with no way to startup a power grid elsewhere.  The GOO advantage when it is perfectly machined timed. "

												It's a good game in general, with beautiful cinematics and a somewhat engaging, if underdeveloped, storyline. All three factions have unique playstyles, and both the Beta and the Humans are very fun to play as.I cannot recommend the game, sadly. The later missions where you play as the third faction, the Goo, are absolutely abysmal. The game pits you (as the Goo), against massively fortified Beta positions that periodically send attack forces against you. In any other RTS, or even just playing as the Humans in this one, that could be a pretty fun challenge!Unfortunately, it's incredibly frustrating as the Goo. Due to their extremely non-traditional economy (resource gathering is done in bursts, there is no base-building or fortification whatsoever, and all units are spawned in small groups by sacrificing ""mother"" units) and the overall fragility of their units, it becomes less of a fun battle to press through enemy bases and more a tedious slog of setback after setback. It takes a huge amount of time to build an army of any meaningful size with the Goo, and it's all but guaranteed that army will be wiped out within one or two battles. "

												Grey Goo is advertised as a classic RTS in the style of Command & Conquer, but unfortunately it isn't so. I have found the gameplay rather shallow and the in-game graphics is not really remarkable at all (a honor mention though goes to the mission introduction cutscenes which are absolutely top-notch). Music is made by the legendary Frank Klepacki and that is definitely another point in favor of this game.Grey Goo isn't a bad game per se but due to its shallowness I cannot recommend it to anyone looking for a classic RTS experience.My vote: 5.5/10			"

												Nearly 30 hours into the multiplayer so far. Grey Goo is an incredible addition to modern RTS, the kind of sloppy a-click gameplay that other RTS games fall victim to is heavily punished by any competent player. Even in casual matches I find tons of new strategies and the game deepens with every match I play. The only downside is the performance and lack of replays, which are huge drawbacks, but if you lower your settings and suck it up you will find much to enjoy - and hopefully with time those issues with dwindle.

												What can I say, within the first 10 seconds you know two things: It is an RTSIt is petroglyph (westwood blood)The RTS games from westwood where togehter with games like tribes (and tribes 2) the games I grew up with. I love these classic simple RTS games that don't try to be more than what they are and just realize how good the core mechanics of an RTS are without all the stuff added on top. Also unlike Starcraft which I would call more RTT than RTS this game doesn't ask you to monitor each unit with near perfecion to be effective. It hence truly is an RTS that is an RTS and nothing more when you look at the mechanics at the core of the game.But there are these subtile things, the Goo ofcourse being stand out playing unlike anything else and yet they don't deviate to much from the core meaning that they are fun to play, a bit different and bringing in an other dynamic to the game. Looking at the Humans their need for a clever base design and keeping it compact while needing static defence for the base as their mobile units need to defect extractors or be on the asault most of the time. The beta are perhaps the most classic of all the ability to just clunk down a base anywhere gives them great flexibility, but at the same time makes them vuranble to multi front attacks as their static defense relies on units of which you can only have so many. The single player campaing is nice and plays well, though some missions need some tweaking specially one of the later beta missions presses you with attacks right away without you getting a chance to even build some basic force. Sure they can be overcome, but could have been done a bit better I say. The cutscenes and stuff are world class without question the animation and art is just stunning and the humans really edge on uncanny vally almost. Such work really adds vallue to the signle player campain. Overal I would really recomend this game to anyone who likes RTS and specially the ones of yesterday and who think like me that many RTS games from recent times are either to Large and complex or to micro and should be named RTT instead.

												Let's keep it short.Great gameplay, astoundingly good graphics, cool soundtrack, good macro-controlled gameplay. However Some performance issues, not too bad though. Not really that addictive in my opinion. Is it good?  Absolutely! Is it fun?  Totally! Graphically superior to other RTS?  In every way it seems! Is it worth the $50 price tag?  Absolutely not. It's fun, and I would be pretty comfortable paying 20-30 dollars for a game like this. But 50? No.If I were you, I would wait for the price drop that's bound to happen soon. But as soon as that price drop does happen, or if you are really,  really  into games such as C&C, definitely give this game a shot!			"

												I really love petroglyph.  They had a game awhile ago back called World At War I believe.  It was new, innovative, and ultimatly a love letter to any RTS player.That game is dead now, but we hav e Goo.  Its really, really a SOLD♥♥♥♥♥RTS!  The factions are different, the graphics are great, the hotkeys are easy to learn.  Its also a little slowed down, I'm sure APM helps but its not the end all.  You have to think about What your going to build more than How your going to use it.  Which for me, is exactly what i want. ( a la total annihlation) I <3 you petroglyph.  You do rts so good.  II know everyone is thinking but what about starcraft?  I like SC2, its a fine game.  But is SC2. the same damn thing.   This game is not SC2.  Its better.  Its better if you love RTS, base building, resource mgmt, STRATEGY.   If you love true RTS (Command and Conq, Total Anhil, Supreme comander, AOE, etc you owe it to yourself to add this fantistic gamne to your collection.Oh and the campain is stellar too.

The Beta's walls were a huge draw for me since I love defensive style and miss the walls of Age of Empires. The Beta and Humans are fairly typical races and not much different from what you'd see in Starcraft. The Goo are unique in their mobility.*Tip* There are only 16 levels in the main campaign.

Yet Another RTS, the graphics are crappy all the units are exxatrated and and oversized even small groups of units are mush of the the screen. Even the humanoid soldiers are size of house. they are 2/3 of the height of the ""tower"" ans same height as the wall. The perspective in done wrong. Really hard to distiquich the height differences and landscape. Everyting is so oversized the is obsructs the view and selection. The terrain really limiting and everything feels so clumsy. Game feels like you tryitng to build Lego death star with oven mittens on and using Dublo blocks.On up note the goo is a good and innovative idea as opponent. Playing the campaing I have yout to see its implamentation and do it actually add anything to this worn out genre. When you compare this to Supreme Comander - which is the benchmark of this genre, this game falls short in every area, except for cut scenes, it seem most of the gmes budget was used making the videos.

You may think, ""ohh but there is this and that and the Goo"", but none of this matters because there is simply no personality, its simply not fun. It's sad to say this, I always root for these devs, but I regret this purchase.			"

												As much as I love what this game stands for, it's wasted potential. I still find fun playing it, but I doubt I'll even finish the campaign. I truly miss the old Westwood days where the games took years to finish, but provided years or replayability.Do I recommend this game: meh**Meh: If you got it on sale or in a bundle, play it with friends, otherwise rather buy the good old First Decade Westwood pack of games.

												A really decent RTS with an old-school feel.Pros:- Really great contrast between the three different factions, particularly with respect to how their infrastructure and economy work- A reasonable single player campaign, if a little short- Actually made you care about / feel concerned for the welfare of an entity whose only real goal in life is to wipe out all other life (this is actually a pretty difficult feat to achive; it's kinda like making someone feel emotionally connected with the Tyranids or Zerg)- Slick pre-rendered cut scenesCons:- Units for each of the three factions feel fairly similar to one another, sans their skins (though to be honest, I kind of appreciated the similarity as I already had enough to worry about trying to get each race's economy to work for me)			"

												Am I playing a different game than the top reviews? Human structures have to be linked to the main base via power lines, which cannot go up or down hills. Apparently humanity can travel to distant stars, but haven't mastered a small incline.Mission says to defend my AI Ally. My ally manages to build 4-5 units and half a dozen buildings in 20 minutes, and doesn't even move the units when its structures are attacked.Clicks on the minimap don't register properly, and you can't jump to a specific location easily.The AI, when attacking, will often blindly attack a refinery while all its units get murdered by my defending units.Playing vs Goo? Enjoy wasting half an hour (or more) hunting down Mother Goos as they roam around the map!I bought this for the single player and I'm severely disappointed.			"

												A fast-paced RTS that reminds me of Starcraft 2. This one however is on Steam! There is a debate whether it's fair to compare those two games, so don't take my word for it. You may perhaps compare it to Command and Conquer as well. But not to Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander or Warzone 2100, to mention some favourite RTS from the past. I hope you get the picture.The campaign mode is engaging enough. After almost completing it I went on to play skirmish. It's in this mode (and multiplayer) the game really shines. I recommend new players to take the time to learn the units, watch replays, read tips and watch videos. Like Starcraft 2, you must be quite aggressive from the beginning and attack with low level units while you at the same time build, expand and upgrade your base so you gradually can attack with more advanced units.I think the graphics and the soundtrack is quite awesome. This is professional work all the way.			"

												It has been too long since we've seen a good triple A RTS, I had hopes that this would be one. Unfortunately it is in every way an inferior Starcraft clone. Simplistic resource system, poor map design, no strategic zoom, simplistic unit design, poor map clearity, unable to make build ques, experimental units unkillable by normal units.I just can't say anything good about this game, our wait for the successor to Supreme Commander continues.

												The primary reason for my negative review is that the UI is infuriatingly annoying to look at in 1440p. It takes up >50% of my 27"" monitor and is very ugly to boot! There is no way to fix this and the developers seem to not want to even try!On top of that, the gameplay itself is very boring and unoriginal. Red Alert 2 has much better RTS mechanics and it is over a decade old.			"

												The Goo faction isn't as entertaining as I had hoped it would be and other than that I feel that the same type and style of RTS has been done before and better in Supreme Commander 2 (and likely other RTS games I have not played).  Grey Goo certainly isn't a bad game, it's a good game and I'd give it a seven out of ten, but at $50, or even at any price, it can't stand up to some of the competition.  +Great music+Good graphics+Enjoyable story+Great user interface-Bland skill tree-Poor unit and building quantity-Playing against the Goo is bothersome and tiring-Average to poor performanceI'm still going to recommend the game, because I think it would be unfair to not recommend something that is overall a pretty good game, but I'd further recommend you to wait for a price cut or sale, or to look at some of the competition.  I feel that even Universe at War (Same dev) is a better game even without taking account the vast difference in price.			"

												Was loving this game until it came time to control the goo. The last mission is a horrible joke. The ai cheats, it is scripted to hell, and some missing UI features make it a nightmare. I've spent 10-12 hours on the last mission alone (#15, Aperture Device) and I don't know how it's possible with the AI having an instant counter for everything you do and 1-3 shotting everything you have all while attacking everything you have simultaneously. There is no game speed control, there is no map pinging when you get attacked. The space bar will go to the last notice, but only the last one, not letting you scroll though things that happen quickly together.The story is great, the qwerty style controls work well, and overall I still love the game, but I hate the goo in Grey Goo.Update.Finished the game + dlc. Made myself do it. Overall I am happy with the experience, but there are some extremely frustrating missions with some ridiculous AI.Also some seemingly obvious behaviors are missing. If an anti-air unit that cannot attack ground gets attacked it just stands there. In Warcraft 3 / Starcraft I was used to not getting attack warning when my screen is already over the fight. This means that in this game you get used to the attack warning going off all the time on something you are intentionally doing. The problem is the cheap AI will do so many attacks at once that once you get involved in an offensive the attack warning means nothing and half of your♥♥♥♥♥♥elsewhere is dead almost immediately. This is compounded by the fact that with the attack warning, the game does not ping the map. You literally have to spend half or more time playing staring at the map.Small FYI, the DLC missions should be played between missions The Terminal and Cauldron.			"

												This game is set in a unique universe in the distant future with distinctly different races, not just factions. (spoiler alert) The Beta resembling a mashup between humans (humanoid) and a T-rex with the vestigial arms. The Goo, a sentient AI / nanite swarm capable of forming various entities resembling lower life forms but yielding destructive combat abilities, and of course the Shroud which you can discover on your own. As you play through each race's campaign you unravel part of the mystery of the Shroud. The complex gameplay, balanced units, and extremely high quality cinematics and voice acting make for a spectacular experience. The gameplay is above par. There are only a couple of units which aren't -quite- balanced and still need a tad of fine tuning, but nonetheless enjoyable. The game has robust visuals, cinematics, dialogue, and back story. The campaign takes on a unique premise (not spoiling this part) and involves some tense realism that will draw you in. Each race has its challenges to overcome, and its strengths which will help propel you toward victory. This game isn't easy. I won't say easy, it has its challenges. The learning curve is not hard to master though. For those who have enjoyed games like Command & Conquer (any of them but especially 3), Red Alert 2/3, and even StarCraft, you will love this game. A unique universe with familiar gameplay style, unique tactics but familiar unit interactions. This game will rekindle your love for RTS. You can fight in a skirmish, play the campaign, or go online against other players. I highly recommend playing through the campaign before trying multiplayer. There are some higher skilled players that will utterly decimate you in short order. I would recommend this game for anyone who can handle a keyboard and mouse, age 8 - 80, there's something for everyone; everyone who loves RTS that is.			"

												Good game.  Easy to pick up. Grey Goo is a game that deserves a good hard look from anyone that enjoys RTS gameplay.  It's not as in depth as say Supreme Commander or Planetary Annalhation, but there is plenty of good things here to keep RTS players interested.  Each race has it's own feel to it and will be played diffrently.  While each race may have units that share roles like light fighters,  artillery,  etc.  They have diffrent methods of play and diffrent upgrades that make them behave diffrently.  They also have at a diffrent Epic unit that has it's own strengths and querks without either one being totally over powered compared to the other. There is only one resource; catalyst.  This is placed on key locations on the map and is sure to be a point of conflict for players. The Beta bring firepower and typical gun units to pumel their threats into submission.The Humans are arguably (one of) the most advanced race in the game, which is a diffrent take compared to most RTS games.  They are heavly dependant on resources, but have some advanced features like teleporting and walls that will let allies fire through them while keeping out the bad guys.The game's namesake, the Grey Goo, is a very interesting group that most RTS players should give a shot at playing if only to get a feel for a new way of playing RTS.  All Goo units are made up of the Goo and so you must decide if you want to strengthen your primary ""building"", build a massive light army, build a smaller army of stronger units, and / or use the mass you gain from Catalyst to focuse on creating more Mother Goo for massive expansion.  A good player will do a mix of all.  I dont recall any RTS game that I've played that is quite like this race, but I hope to see more traits of the Goo implemented.       While I have not played as the ______ I will leave a mystery until someone interested in the game has a chance to play them.   I was not aware of this 4th faction until I had almost beaten the game and the surprise was a great treat.   The fact that this faction was added as a bonus as free DLC to all players later on along with a new mission raises my already good opinion of the devs.  In addition to gameplay this game has a very interesting storyline, good graphics, and fantastic voice acting.   There are plenty of plot twists that happen in the game.  Some of them are expected some not so much.   All the while presented in a nice pretty format to keep you interested.			"

												Edit : I'm changing this (and rewriting most parts) to ""Not recommended except if it goes on at least a 50% sale"" because the value of this game is rapidly deteriorating and it doesn't look like it's going to go up soon.TL;DR 4/10 if I had to give a rating, bumped to 5.5/10 because there's no real concurrence these days and we don't have enough good sci-fi RTS games, so this can pass as acceptable in these circumstances.A mediocre game that could have been good or even great.It begins really nicely with an extremely well-done and impressive intro cinematic, and in fact ""cinematic"" really describes the single-player campaign as a whole. A huge effort has been made here to create a compelling story, with every mission ending with a cut-scene and some of them beginning with one as well. Voice acting during said cutscenes is excellent, and unit voice acting is also pretty decent - you don't hear the same lines every two seconds when giving orders, so that's nice -. On the topic of voices, they actually hired someone to invent a new language for the Beta aliens, and they use it! I can appreciate a company going the extra mile for this kind of thing, even if said aliens switch to English when you're playing them. I'd honestly have liked it more if their whole campaign was subtitled instead, but that's my personal opinion. Soundtrack is also pretty nice and varied.Now, I have two main issues with the single-player campaign. The first one is that it's pretty short : 3*5 missions isn't much, even if some are challenging enough even on Normal difficulty. The first two missions of a faction are usually some kind of tutorial, so really you get three full-length missions per faction. But when you see the amount of extra work they did for every one of said missions, it' can almost be acceptable. However, they're also quite badly designed as far as actual gameplay is concerned, and that's more problematic. Almost every single mission follows the exact same pattern of : start with very few units and buildings while enemy is already fully developped, rush some early units for defense to repel the constant assaults, then start building a huge army and crush your enemy without encountering much resistance. Objectives aren't particularly varied, they're of the ""Destroy every enemy"" variety almost all the time with generally one different mission per faction (i.e. the Beta campaign has the only actual siege defense mission). The designers also seem to really like the concept of magically spawning enemy units, which I've always found terrible in RTS games and a proof of designers being unable to create actual difficulty. It's frustrating to face, but it also limits player creativity because you cannot try a bold assault to try and destroy some of the enemy facilities to relieve your main base from the constant assaults for instance. Even worse, sometimes the ""magical unit"" is an epic unit, which is extremely powerful and is supposed to take 5 whole minutes and a lot of ressources to build. Sometimes the epic enemy unit will spawn even if you've already beaten the player it supposedly belongs to, which is completely stupid.This is sad, because obviously the developer put a lot of work into this campaign... so I have to wonder why they didn't spend a little more resource on the actual design of the missions. It's all in the ""exterior"" of the campaign, but the meat of it is actually pretty bland and not that interesting once you get to it.More on the gameplay : the factions have a very distinct look&feel especially as bases are concerned (or lack of base, for the Goo) so that's very good. However, a LOT of units are extremely similar in every faction, especially ground units (the Goo does not have aerial units, so there's more diversity there). Light tanks are very similar, artillery that fires from long range, etc. Obviously there's going to be some staples, but since units do NOT have any special ability whatsoever (except passive ones, like ""attack applies a debuff"") armies tend to follow a similar composition all the time. Compare to a game like Earth 2160 (which I'm going to use as example because it's similar on several points, including the aliens with a very distinct playstyle.) where the LC clearly has more manoeuverable units and some very unique weapons (like the electric cannon), but paper-thin units.As far as multiplayer is concerned, the first thing you'll notice is that it's dead, with players sometimes waiting up to 20 minutes for a game that has a high chance of being over after your opponent used a cheese strategy. Most people have already abandoned the game at this point due to a combination of imbalance, lags and disconnects (including people abusing disconnects to avoid a loss, and somehow this still isn't patched as of 7th March) as well as performance issues for many people. Also there's neither replay nor observer mode, shocking for a game that pretends to cater to the e-sport crowd. The new balance patch is also terrible with devs using a sledgehammer to destroy half the units instead of trying to carefully balance the game, nerfs everywhere that will make some units and buildings close to unusable (i.e. teleporter). The rarely-used Humans somehow took most of the nerfs for some weird reason.Skirmishes are terrible and their main ""redeeming"" quality is that unlike in many other games, the AI does not cheat by getting free resources or building its units twice as fast. That's good because it means less frustration/unfairness, but on the other hand it also means that skirmishes are ridiculously easy even on Hard, especially in a 1v1 setting. We're very far from C&C 3's Brutal AI for instance, that took me many tries to beat. The only other correct point is that ""Free for all"" is actually implemented correctly, so AIs will not implicitly team up against the player.  All of this is just negated by the fact that the skirmish AI sucks terribly and does not pose any challenge whatsoever, no matter the ""personality"" that you choose for it. In fact, that's why the AI gets tons of free units in the campaigns : because the AI is way too bad to be a threat if it doesn't start with a full base and 10 extractors. This means that there's really no point in playing the skirmish, not as a ""preparation"" for the multiplayer (which will probably be completely dead soon anyway) and not as a fun game itself. Compare to Stronghold Crusader that also had AIs with different ""personalities"", but they were actually a challenge. And this game was released more than ten years ago, and was also arguably more complex. There's no reason for such a simple RTS (compared to most of its concurrents) to have such a terrible AI.In fact, the skirmish mode is so boring and uninteresting that the achievement page lists literally 0% of people as having the ""Win 100 skirmishes"" achievement. No.One. I'm pretty sure back in the days I won way more than 100 skirmishes in C&C Generals for instance, but this game also had better AI, more unit diversity and also much more map diversity.Overall it's still a somewhat enjoyable game but waaaaaaay overpriced for what it is. If you really like RTSes like I do and are starved for a new game it can be sort of worth buying, but it's still not worth its price and even at 50% the content is light compared to many other games. However it's admittedly a relatively well-polished title : I haven't found a single bug and the game runs fluidly on max settings. (I do have a brand new computer though, and quite a lot of people have had performance issues)This game is not worth its price, the single-player content is weaker than in a lot of games (which are usually much cheaper), lack of replays, observer modes and bad balance means that multiplayer is also going down the drain so if that's your main reason to buy a RTS, you're out of luck with this title.

												If anyone is thinking about picking up Grey Goo, do it! It has many of the great aspects of RTS's past and present. Currently besides Blizzard games, Grey Goo represent the best this genre has to offer. A compelling story line, Interesting and varied characters, and get this...A Language barrier within the game. Ever wonder why all aliens always speak English in games today? Not in Grey Goo. Small features such as the language barrier really make the game stand apart of other titles. This game does not require excess competitiveness from the player, nor micro second reaction times. Just a keen interest in Science Fiction, and a yearning for great game. All three races distinctly stand apart from each other, from resource management, base construction and even units. While there are some very minor issues with balance, they are sure to be fixed and patched. Grey Goo is a game meant to be enjoyed and savored, not a mad rush to the end to win. A little about me in terms of previous games I've played to make the above statements validated.Starcraft SeriesWarcraft SeriesAge of Empires SeriesRise of NationsStronghold SeriesSins of a Solar Empire SeriesBlack and White SeriesDungeon Keeper SeriesCommand and Conquer SeriesSupreme Commander SeriesBattle RealmsDuneThe Settlers SeriesMajesty SeriesEmpire Earth Age of MythologyEvil Genius Warhammer 40k Dawn of War SeriesAnno 2070Planetary Annihilation			"

												Lacking in most aspects, unfortunatly.Was really excited to get this game, more so when i saw petroglype as the devs for this game.But i was disappointed after investing several hours.Its hard to explain if your not an RTS player, but its missing something, a touch, that special mojo a good RTS has.It feels dull, the units, feel boring and uninspiring, not interesting to play with, most of them aren't that different from their counterpart in the opposite faction (humans and beta), most of the time you need to play with 2-3 type of units throughout a match.I probably wont get any different feeling if i get to play with the game units or just with square pixels that shoot data at each other.Im fine with the design of the Beta and Humans, but the Goo faction...for me this was one of the biggest cons, even more when it came to multiplayer.I dont like their design, the way the faction play to gain map control and the cat and mouse chase you need to play against it, i played as humans mostly and always felt a hassle, frustration and a chore when dealing with that faction.Its way too asymetrical to enjoy playing it or against it (more of the latter).As a former SC2 diamond player, grey goo does offer a slower pace gameplay.its good on paper, but bad idea in practice.While i dont have much to complain with slower pace, this whole structure leads the game to a big macro battles in multiplayer, and in some cases turtle wars... which drag games and gets boring very fast.While the cutscenes in the game are top notch, the characters in them were all dull and boring.I didn't feel immersed at all with them or the story, which had so many plot gaps and uninspiring writting.Missions were pretty much destroy X enemies, even more annoying when trying to destroy all the goo units...Multiplayer was fun for a few games, until u get to play vs the goo,getting cheesed by the goo due to some map imbalance, getting into turtle macro wars or generally waiting 15 min for matchmaking to find a game.could have been so much more..6.5/10  "

												The classic 3 faction RTS standerd afair, walls is your friend, and some half bake mechanics are what Grey Goo is all about. The half bake are pages taken from many other games; one example are units hidden in forest are invisble until one of your own units goes into the forest to expose them other wise you can't shoot at them. Its kinda hard to really hide a heavy unit under tree covers this is not LoL hidden in the bushes you know. And the Goo faction have element copy from the alien from Earth series. The UI always been hard to perfection so therefore, Grey Goo UI have some miner design flaws as well.Story in a RTS o.O oh my, well Grey Goo did above the average RTS story at least its interesting imo. But as it is I cant say Grey Goo was any better in term of game play when compare to other RTS. If I may suggest it would been more fun to see battle last a lot longer, I mean units die in 5-10 sec is not exactly a long battle or much to see. The fact units cant change there main weapon or lact of mode/secondary/option have made it a one shot pony like too many RTS unit design.The game dont have much to offers in term new innovation, while the BETA race design should been the human while the human faction looks a bit more on the alien side, and would have fit the BETA more imo. However, the maps, graphics, 3D models, and story elements are all up to date for year 2014 RTS standerd. I rate Grey Goo a good RTS game and can stand on its own with Standerd RTS CORE gameplay. IMO Grey Goo the name is bad and so the bottom line it just ANOTHER RTS with above average Story IMO but still good game. I can't recommend with my PLAY TIME nor I personally will pay more then $5 for it so get the game when its on sale other wise spend in moderation.			"

												tldr. slow gameplay (think age of empires), only diversity this game has is for being a little different than the other rts'.  huge lack of diversity in units. comes in 3s.  3 light 3 flyer, 3 medium\heavy 1 big boss.  but it is a beautiful game.  very weird clunky main menu and options though. (on my native 1600x1050 or whatever view)very slow unless you like the slow pace of this game, like age of empires slow or so. but at least that game has 100 times more diversity of units. usual hording zerging mobbing massing RTS game with the semi standard 200 pop cap. (with no unit cap buildings, so instant 200 cap from the start)the two base factions are very similar.  units aren't very diversified, one anti air, one artillery, one siege breaker, one tank, two scouts, two fliers (except for goo) very slow gameplay. its a different rts game for sure, but not in a good different. i would in no manner ever spend the near $40 full price, maybe if i had a job again the $20 sale price.  you're better off with command and conquer (mods?) and starcraft 2, age of empires, etc.you can't force fire attack on the ground with artillery sometimes (hand of ruk) and other artillery units.  perhaps i was trying to have them fire too close to themselves, but with a lack of 'attack range' other than the useless 'fire range of 400' description, and nothing in the options that i could see (ground control 2 thank you!) enables unit sight lines \ attack lines etc.  i could barely do a thing with the artillery. most useless units in the game unless firing upon static \ idle units.any unit should be able to force fire, hence the reason why force fire was ever created i'd imagine.upgrades. oh gods.  this game has 4 upgrades. only 4.   actually its 4 selections of 3 upgrades. for a total of 12. but you can only select 4.  so its still 4 to me.  a nice way of making actual tactical decisions. if they mattered much really.  here's the best part! if you research one upgrade, and decide to choose one of the other 2. you remove that upgrade, to purchase the other upgrade.  but your original upgrade? you'd have to research it ALL OVER AGAIN AND PURCHASE IT if you didn't like the new upgrade.gameplay. all macro and .1% micro.underbrush \ cover is semi useful. if you could tell where it begins and ends.  sometimes i would put units in a forested area thinking 'oh they're under the cover' whereas in reality they're probably on the border between entering cover and exiting it. thus being fired upon with no enemies under the trees too.very hard to tell with the patrol system, it looks like your standard multiple waypoint system, with no way of telling until you actual view the entire patrol path, that yes.   unit does go point A-B-C...Z-A all over again.  it is not shown this way in game.  so example.  make a unit patrol in a triangle.  you would make the patrol waypoints look like /\   <- see how the bottom part of the triangle is missing?  the unit automatically fills that point out as the unit goes from the last point of 'this triangle' across the missing part, back to the beginning.would've saved me a lot of time if i could just beta test like i do other games. at least then this review and complaints may be taken into consideration.i'm just trying to save you $49.99 <- gods is a game never worth this nowadays that i can think of.

												Technical problems bring this game down to a ""Not Recommended"" zone. Grey Goo's gameplay makes for a fun, if not outstanding RTS game. However, even after a hardware upgrade and exceeding the recommend specs, the game just tanks in FPS.First off, my specs:Windows 8.1 64-bitIntel i5-4590 Quad CoreGeforce GTX 760 (driver version 362.00)Samsun SSD 850 PRO 512GB (primary drive)WDC WD5000 (secondary drive)I run this game on medium-low settings.So, the big problem I have with this game involves major FPS loss when a significant amount of units are onscreen. I believe this is due to how the more units are onscreen, the model models need to be rendered and shaders (special effects essentially) have to be calculated. I'm guessing the models lack optimization, especially when FPS starts to dip into low 20's. I am unsure if the maps in the game are unoptimized as well, but I think the units are the major problem.The gameplay was enjoyable, if a bit slow paced. I very much appreciate the modular building style of the Beta and Human factions, as well as being able to quickly select units to build/ buildings to make/techs to reserach with a MOBA-style QWER hotkey system. I haven't run into many balance issues, but that could be from inexperience. The campaign boasts nicely rendered cutscenes and some actually challenging missions, even if the story is forgettable. Overall, even with the generally decent gameplay, my technical issues stopped me from enjoying this game. I imagine if I had a 970 or a 980 (or their AMD equivalent), my game would run a lot better. If you didn't purchase a new CPU and/or GPU in the last 3 years, it's likely you will struggle with FPS like I did. "

That's pretty much some of the latter missions, with everything you learnt in the previous missions being useless.A challenge is one thing, but a full week of frustrations on a single mission?Do not recommend.

(with no unit cap buildings, so instant 200 cap from the start)the two base factions are very similar.  units aren't very diversified, one anti air, one artillery, one siege breaker, one tank, two scouts, two fliers (except for goo) very slow gameplay. its a different rts game for sure, but not in a good different. i would in no manner ever spend the near $40 full price, maybe if i had a job again the $20 sale price.  you're better off with command and conquer (mods?) and starcraft 2, age of empires, etc.you can't force fire attack on the ground with artillery sometimes (hand of ruk) and other artillery units.  perhaps i was trying to have them fire too close to themselves, but with a lack of 'attack range' other than the useless 'fire range of 400' description, and nothing in the options that i could see (ground control 2 thank you!) enables unit sight lines \ attack lines etc.  i could barely do a thing with the artillery. most useless units in the game unless firing upon static \ idle units.any unit should be able to force fire, hence the reason why force fire was ever created i'd imagine.upgrades. oh gods.  this game has 4 upgrades. only 4.   actually its 4 selections of 3 upgrades. for a total of 12. but you can only select 4.  so its still 4 to me.  a nice way of making actual tactical decisions. if they mattered much really.  here's the best part! if you research one upgrade, and decide to choose one of the other 2. you remove that upgrade, to purchase the other upgrade.  but your original upgrade? you'd have to research it ALL OVER AGAIN AND PURCHASE IT if you didn't like the new upgrade.gameplay. all macro and .1% micro.underbrush \ cover is semi useful. if you could tell where it begins and ends.  sometimes i would put units in a forested area thinking 'oh they're under the cover' whereas in reality they're probably on the border between entering cover and exiting it. thus being fired upon with no enemies under the trees too.very hard to tell with the patrol system, it looks like your standard multiple waypoint system, with no way of telling until you actual view the entire patrol path, that yes.   unit does go point A-B-C...Z-A all over again.  it is not shown this way in game.  so example.  make a unit patrol in a triangle.  you would make the patrol waypoints look like /\   <- see how the bottom part of the triangle is missing?  the unit automatically fills that point out as the unit goes from the last point of 'this triangle' across the missing part, back to the beginning.would've saved me a lot of time if i could just beta test like i do other games. at least then this review and complaints may be taken into consideration.i'm just trying to save you $49.99 <- gods is a game never worth this nowadays that i can think of.

												The developers have put a lot of work into the campaign and the graphics, voice actors, and concept is really interesting. That being said, the mechanics are what you'd expect from a 90's RTS.  I always enjoyed playing Red Alert and Warcraft so I thought it would be great change of pace from some of the faster paced modern ones, turns out not really. I tried to like the game, played a couple campaign missions and a skirmish. Within the two hours I had it, it really felt like I understood all that the game had to offer.			"

												Played the free weekend and suffered mild enjoyment. Good eye candy in the cut scenes and the game itself. Visually and audibly a polished performance. The game premise is good and I looked for a C&C experience which it just falls short of providing - make enough units of the same kind (the tank model in all 3 races) and the AI can be steam-rollered. At first I was pleased that the three races  seemed to differ in approach to base building more than most games of this nature, that impression vanishes as you realise how linear it is and that the units are just the same thing reskinned for each faction.If you like the resource gather, build base, overwhelm enemy genre then this is ok - but not at the full price. It's probably just about worth the 60% off that was given during the demo weekend so well done if you took advantage.			"

												Ehhh.... I get it that the main selling point is the goo faction, but in itself it's so boring.Yeah, you split your mother goo through mitosis after you've gained enough size, yeah, you split pieces and make units out of that, yeah it goes though cliffs in a fluid way.But it's just so damn underwhelming in the end.I keep circling around the same description... ""It's like command and conquer crashed into total annihilation""The freaking campaign... Freakin' a'. Tutorial mission, 3 missions and swap faction. I'm seriously hope there's a twist at the end of the goo campaign where we go to a different planet or something, 'cause if I'm 2 missions away from the end of the game, then this ride has simply not been worth release price.Predicrable, too... Tutorial, intro to heavy units, intro to specialized units, intro to ultimate units.I'm sorry, but I've played indie games that were leaps more interesting than this and costed about half. Not worth the full price.Final counterpoint.It bugs me how much the Beta remind me of Na'Vi. Just dropping that in there.Now, the one thing I liked is that it's easy to produce buildings and units. Using QWERT to navigate through the construction menus.			"

												The lack of depth really kills this game for me. At first I was surprised by how different the factions' tech trees were. The base building system is something new  - every faction has different ways to build their bases and I love it. BUT units are boring. all races (well, except the goo) have pretty much the same units and only 2 structures for unit training. Mix that with lack of unit abilities (like grenades or barages) and you have a repetetive experience. This is a decent RTS, but it's far from excellent one.			"

												Good gameplay, great music, bad campaign, inconsistent and pretty random story, mediocre performance, looks amazing. But I have to think before recommending. It's easy to get lost in a ""oh god no slow RTS of this kind Red Alert 3"" mindset, but that immediatly sprawls doubt into my mind - while it's immediatly visible that this was made by people who worked on great games before, why did they have so much trouble with making unit control good? I mean... it's hard to explain.For example, in C&C3 and RA3, I could send 16 bombers on 16 different targets in 20 seconds. Here, it's nigh impossible to micro like that. All units of one type are bunched up in the selection box, and even the control is pretty basic. Attack move, hold ground, guard, that's it. There are no abilities. The strategy is limited to ""bunch up 200/200 units and A-move"" or ""get artillery and slowpush every single inch"". Even economy was automated almost to the point of not existing, and micro is... almost discouraged.Even the units don't do many different things. Just build 1 type from each category + some artillery and you're golden, maybe some AA but only after they've revealed they have aircraft. Anti-armour from light units, tank from heavy units, and a fighter from flying. Epics are more interesting, but... they're tad too powerful. Place an Alpha in a chokepoint, nothing will ever get through. Two Hand of Ruks are capable of killing a stream of thousands of Goo. Etc. It's really hard to kill an epic unit once it's out. No amount of strategy available will save you if they have support. Hand of Ruk can easly decimate 200/200 of units. And in the campaign, oh god, when you face epic units of Humans and Beta, it's always on a map with many, many chokepoints and narrow fields. It's impossible to position against AoEThe build menu is good. It's basicly what was in C&C3, but with less hotkeys. The idea of the tech tree is pretty interesting. You get to pick 1 out of 3 upgrades, however some are just straight up better than others. That effectively limits the tech tree significantly, as usually most people will always pick the same upgrades.I can't get my thoughts straight. So I'll tl;dr - it's the same type of a game as C&C3, but inferior in gameplay mechanics and campaign. Doesn't mean it's bad. It's a good. But not good enough. It's clusmy. It's basic. It performs badly. Edit: upgraded my PC to the best I could. Second most powerful 980GTX and a new CPU. Game still runs like crap.			"

												I picked this up during the summer steam sale and while it does have some nice qualities, overall I feel it is lacking in depth, expected RTS features, and overall seems a bit risk averse to give it staying power. I did have some fun going through some matches, but ultimately don't anticipate this will remain in my library for long. Specifics thoughts:-Nice keyboard shortcut scheme. You select the building or unit type with QWER+ and then it brings up a new set of choices, again QWER+ and then a final menu. So, if you need a certain unit you very quickly realize you can do EQQ or whatever... but, the game does lack some expected commands. Can't pause at any point or change the game speed, no select all units, couldn't figure out how to bring up FPS, etc. -Has a neat cover system where you can hide in a forest and fire from it w/o being targeted... but, there's few areas on the maps and they are too large. They should've been more liberal with the placement of cover and included some smaller one-unit areas. Some other games I can recall have done this maybe a bit better. -The two human/alien races are a bit too similar. Props to them for making the Goo race work very differently, though. I feel they put all their risk in this one race and played the rest of the game too conservatively. -The units within those races are a bit too similar. For example, it's very obvious in a game like StarCraft how a marine, siege tank, and hellion are different. No questions about strengths and even confusing unit types. In this game, the units tend to run together once in a category. There are a few exceptions, air units and artillery are definitely different, but I found the units overall a bit bland. -The tech is pretty cool. You have 4 tech choices each with 3 options. Once you commit to an option within those choices (eg, Tech granting Anti-Air unit ground attacks as well) you can't pick the other 2. Was easy enough to manage from the interface and understand what each bonus was. I tended to pick the same bonuses game to game, unsure if that was play style or simply balance problems but would have to play more to know for sure. -Framerate / slowdowns - Toward the end of a longer game, the game 'stutters' while trying to compensate for what I think is low framerates (can't pull it up to determine, though). Could be network? Hard to say what it was, but I've got a solid connection and a solid i7 w/ GTX 960 and graphics actually mostly turned down. -Building placement all have to be part of your initial set of root structures (either your HQ or hubs if you're playing Beta). They went for a smaller singular base as a game decision, okay that works. However, it is not elegantly done. Some of the ways attachments work early on (you have to attach a Tank module to a factory to allow you to build tanks) make it easy for new players to make mistakes and build useless modules. In addition, it was a bit buggy when selling structures, I'd sometimes cut power off to half my base. Okay, that's a feature, let me rebuild it to connect power again. Nope. Guess it is a bug, but ran into a few times where visually I should have power but half my buildings wouldn't. All in all, for a 60% off steam sale this reminded me of the heyday of RTS fifteen years ago where I'd pick up a new game in the summer and nine out of ten times would see it fall flat, just as this one has.

												Free weekend reflections; somewhat standard RTS with a very much improved/industry leading interface.   Units / tech don't feel like they have a lot of individuality (other than maybe goo). Three races have moderately different features, but this isn't AOE2 or WC3.   Overall, very solid game. Ideally they'll support more than 4 players in a game and add a few more units/individualizations (no unit has abilities, for instance) ... biggest differentiator is the incredibly clean/simple interface. Really, really nice interface.			"

I decided to go in and play a 2v2 skirmish match (me + 1 a.i. vs. 2 a.i.) and my game got to a point where it was unplayable. The game would constantly lag for 10 seconds at a time every 5 seconds so I was sitting there watching my units stand idly more than I was actually playing. It wasn't a framerate issue as all the units were still doing their idle animations. My computer can run any game currently in the market at the highest quality without any issues yet this game starts to lag with a simple 2v2.			"

												I enjoy the game.  Despite what others say, it is fairly balanced and concentrates on strategy more than micro like most newer RTS' to date.  I see people complaining about the unit structure, but I dare say, these people obviously never played the original C&C.  The units and gameplay are loosely based on the classic old RTS that we know and love.  Back when you only had... 2 factions to pick from.The only con I have with this game, is in fact the Goo.  I don't like their faction, and all the skirmishes I play with friends, the Goo are not used.  I find the game to be entirely more enjoyable with out the goo faction in a match.8/10 would play without Goo again.			"

												Some first impressions:Campain:- The story and characters of the game are soooooo lame- It is so boring, nothing more to say. But personally I dont care about single player.Controlls:+ Hotkeys are customizable. just some minor limitations and bugs, that i assume will be fixed some time. + Camera location hotkeys exist- Some controlls are not thought though, For instance, the attack move mode disappears after shift clicking it. That makes it cumbersome to queue them. On the other hand, patrolling and repairing modes stay activated until a right click. It should be the same logic as for the attack move: click once -- > attack move mode gone, shift-click --> stay in that mode.- Cycle throug subgroup key exists, but is not bindableGame concept:- Terrans and beta have very similar tech trees - why?- For terrans every building must be connected to the main base - you cannot have a 2nd base from where you can start to connect stuff. That means ...       - it is harder to expand       - there are little possibilities for being cheesy (no hidden stuff ...)       - its not fun at allOther:+ Maps look really fancy+ The goo faction is really innovative and cool- Kind of stupid to call the game after one of three factions- Terran units all look very similarConclusion:I am not sure if I would recommend this game. In the current state no. But some improvements regarding controlls and entirely changing the terran faction might make the game a lot more fun. In the end I have to say: I am disappointed - mostly because it is so close to be a good game.I was looking for a casual alternative for SC2, something I can play when dont feel like hacking more than 150 APM. Lets assume it is not about APM and we are able to execute every strategy we want. Than there are a lot of valid strategies and cheese for every faction in SC2, but I do not see that in Grey Goo. Maybe because I am a noob, but Terran in Grey Goo definately do not offer possibilities for creative stuff.			"

												I initially installed, played this, got bored and then uninstalled it.  For some reason I then decided to try again.  Wow, am I glad I did.  I don't know what I missed the first time but this time I was addicted.  It's a great game that harks back to the classic C&C games.  It lacks some of the more recent RTS aspects, such as unit levelling, but if you long for a classic experience then this is certainly worth your time and money.			"

												Solid RTS harking back to the classic days of the genre, but with enough originality to give it some legs in the modern world. I loved the cut-scene driven story, even if it wasn't live-action (I miss Westwood Studios). It's a shame it was never more popular than what it was.			"

												A pretty nice traditional RTS, feels like a mix of C&C and starcraft. Each race plays in it's own way and has it's own strategies but in the end it just boils down to numbers. The Campaign is fun to play through and not too hard on normal (despite what people say), there are 15 missions. 5 for each faction namely the Beta, Human and Goo. Mission 15 however totally ruined it for me, if you think mission 5 is hard then 15 will feel impossible. Especially because after learning what to do with mission 3 I felt like breezing through the game, only mission 7 (wtf is up with that one...) giving me some trouble and obviously more than 15+ (or double) tries on the last one. The spike in difficulty in the end is just to great of a contrast compared to the rest being fairly easy. Besides singleplayer the game has skirmish but I feel like it had very little maps, and also very little variation ie no snowy or industrial maps like starcraft has for example. Production feels top notch, cutscenes look great and graphics look great too. At a pricepoint of 50 (I bought it at 25 in sale back a while but couldn't play during to a crash) i wouldn't recommend it but as it stands now I would.			"

												I am playing the campaign right now and I love this game. I know it came out sometime ago but still the game is great and the story is interesting. Great cutscenes in the game aswell.Gameplay is good but could be better. Sometimes I play the campaign and it feels like getting resources to build up your base can be a pain when the enemy got alot of units but that is why there is a difficulty curve for you. I am doing mission on the NORMAL difficulty.Petroglyph though propably makes the best RTS around now still if you do not count StarCraft 2 and Total Annihilation: Titans.But I love these old school RTS games. Truly an era that is almost lost in time and needs to be revived!			"

												Surprisingly refreshing - think a modern version of C&C with a pretty good story (and suprisingly good voice acting) so far.There are a few lumps in the interface, but overall, it's a good C&C throwback with interesting mechanics and quite good graphics.  Runs very smoothly maxed out at 4K on a Maxwell Titan X.			"

												I'd never heard of this game until I saw it promoted in a Humble Bundle. It looked promising, and was pretty fun to play. The most entertaining feature for me was the battles between large groups of small units with different unit compositions. The ability to micro in this game does feel rather stifled, so overall who has better macro and understanding of the game will come out ahead over who has higher mechanical skill.			"

												The game felt a bit rushed. Seemed like there wasn't a great intro to each race and a full yet gradual understanding of thier abilities. This would be a harder RTS to get into than many others if you didn't have previous RTS experience. Really seemed like each race needed their own full story. I loved the little unexpected part to the story but I think the campaign needed to be about 3 times the size to get a good feel and connect with each race.  Seemed like all 3 races were smashed into a campaign designed for one.Still, really enjoyed the concept, enjoyed the somewhat unique play style of the goo.			"

Posted: March 7, 2015
 Grey Goo is an Impressive, Dissappointing AchievementGrey Goo is the latest RTS offering from Petroglyph and the first effort of new developer Gray Box studios. It comes with a full featured 15 mission campaign consisting of 5 missions for each of the three factions to tell a story in the style of StarCraft or WarCraft, eight multiplayer maps that can be played 2v2 or 1v1, and a strong skirmish AI for those players who either don't feel the need to play online, or cannot for whatever reason (more on that later). Taking place on a lush habitable world called Ecosystem-9, Grey Goo is an impressive achievement and a sign of great things to come from developer Grey Box. It also kind of sucks, and that is a real shame, because there is no reason for it.First, the good. Grey Goo's three races are all extremely interesting and just bursting with flavor. The humans on Ecosystem 9 are members of an expeditionary fleet who have arrived to survey and colonize the planet. Their units are all drones (save their awesomely cool epic unit, the Alpha, a kilometer tall exoskeleton that fires a sweeping laser blast) to emphasize the lack of available human personell, their bases consist of linked nodes and rely on impressive turrets powered by artificial intelligence to defend themselves. The beta are a more traditional RTS race, relying on robotic fighting vehicles and infantry; they build their bases off of many smaller hubs that can be placed anywhere in your vision range. Perhaps most interesting are the titular Goo, a mobile race that builds no structures, but who employ many mobile masses of goo that serve as your resource collectors and factories. Taken together, the races feel very fleshed out and interesting, and I was impressed by the imagination that went in to them.The developers also succeeded immensely at their goal of streamlining the game. Units themselves have no individual abilities, so the player can focus on production and positioning; every single structure and upgrade can be conveniently built directly in the UI with the Q, W, E, and R keys; along with a seldom-relevant population cap, there is only a single resource to manage. Grey Goo also looks gorgeous on low to medium settings and still runs well on my relatively old machine.Finally, Grey Goo's campaign is also a really impressive technical feat. The developers wisely avoid giving you too much up front, and during the course of your 15 mission campaign they reveal a complete and interesting universe that, frankly, I am very excited about. Each mission is bookended by some impressive CGI, and while you get fewer action oriented cutscenes relative to other games, it still feels like you're playing a game made by professional people.  Of course, if you have the misfortune to be actually playing the campaign, that feeling will quickly erode. This is one of the worst, most poorly designed RTS campaigns I've ever seen. I don't want to give the impression that I am saying that lightly either. Grey Goo's missions are chockablock full of moments that will make you throw up your hands in genuine rage and exasperation, or cause you to bellow ""WHAT?!""In one mission you are tasked with building the Beta's epic unit and then crossing the map with it. Literally seconds in to the game you will face a complete attack wave, and the only way you can prevail is by exploiting the incompetent AI and maneuvring your single unit (you will not have had time to build even one at this point) and picking off their army one by one while they attack your buildings. In another mission, you are required to find an escape pod for one of your AI crew members, activate it, and then return it to your base. When I found him, the activation simply failed to trigger, and even after I had completely wiped out the enemy forces, I was unable to complete the mission. In general, the map design consists of narrow corridors that make necessary micromanagement of your units an incredible chore.Even when the game is functioning as intended, it is outrageously difficult for no good reason that I can see. I was at one time a Master league StarCraft player, and breezed through the StarCraft 2 campaign on Hard. I found Grey Goo a test of my skill, and unfortunately a test of my patience. I was pushed to my utter limit while attempting the campaign on hard difficulty, and I eventually swapped to normal and still found that punitive, so I dropped it down to Easy to cruise through the final three missions. It was still a long slog each time on that difficulty (made more painful by the fact that the developers went trigger happy with spawning enemy epic units in the final stages of the game), and I averaged around 40 minutes per mission, most of which is comprised of a slow battle of attrition through carefully arranged enemy defensive structures that have far too much health. A patch has since toned down the Normal and Easy difficulties, but they are still a complete chore to play, and in no way enjoyable except as a crucible to test yourself.The campaigns fail completely as a teaching tool as well. Early in the Goo campaign you are told that your mobile factory and harvester, the Mother Goo, can collect resource spigots by moving over them. They do not mention that these spigots regenerate even if your Mother Goo just sits on the resource point, and that in 100% of occasions your mother goo should sit stationary, collecting resources. In fact, almost none of the units get a proper introduction the way they would in other RTS games, and I am still confused as to why you would ever build the Beta's siege unit when it is so squishy and expensive, and fails to outrange towers.Fortunately, the multiplayer components of the game are good, if in need of some balance fine tuning. Unfortunately, barely a month after launch, it is nearly impossible to find someone online to play with. It isn't clear if this is because the game has been largely abandoned, or because something went badly wrong on the developer end, and the multiplayer is apparently region locked for reasons no one can understand. The VerdictGrey Goo oozes promise. I have every expectation that when we get the enticing sequel that the campaign promises. it will be a home run. But this first effort falls far short of the mark, and you should only play it if you are absolutely dead set on doing so. I went in determined to like it, and Grey Goo's remarkably bad campaign and nonfunctional multiplayer beat the appreciation out of me in no time.			"

												Normal defensive AI is more aggressive than normal normal AI (why?), you unlock a campaign after completing another one instead of being able to access them all at the beginning (why??), and the main menu screen lags out immensely for no reason (why???)Credit where it's due, the graphics are pretty good, but it plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥and I would much prefer other RTS games like Dawn of War and Supreme Commander, which were far more enjoyable than this and far better balanced as well. They may not look as good, but in my opinion, it's more about how well the game PLAYS, rather than how good it looks.			"

												A game for those who love Red Alert. That is to say, for those who enjoyed rifles & tanks with a range of 12 units, and ""artillery"" with a range of 13. Absurd in a post Company Of Heroes, Jeff Wayne`s War Of The Worlds, and especially Supreme Commander 1 era. Tactical unit A.I. is predictably minimal... that is to say units do pretty much nothing unless you tell them to. Every little triviality requires your absolute personal attention. So very tired of this style of rts play.Great graphics, excellent lore, and Australian accent (?) aliens. But nothing more than a twitchfestival at its gameplay core.			"

												I like the game a lot, it's simple it has promise and it's semi-well built.however I have a few gripes.Campaign is rediculously short, underwhelming and sequel baiting (I seriously consider this game nothing more than a long and uneccessary prelude) the characters are underdeveloped but they act dry and make pathetic attempts at eliciting emotions from us. it acts bigger than it really is and just doesn't offer any kind of commitment.This could be fixed if it had some form of codex or written backstory for all the factions, but I found it to be wanting and yearning to be more. the story is so short that it'd be the freaking condensed prelude at the start of a book, no more than two pages long. There's no Lore no real level of emotion, it's as if this was written by a cookie cutter form and filled in with bold letters.The Game has bugs, I encountered over thirty eight bugs in the first mission alone. Granted I and several other people did real QA kind of work. We went through every mission sixteen times and found weird bugs and simple scripting errors. My favorite was the bug which allowed us to just park invisible units at one spot, save the game and load it up, the enemy would spawn in the same exact spot every time, never fire a shot and die. we did this to the last level ""Apature"" where we had to defend the conduits, we went down the entire 5 minutes without loosing a single unit, we even moved a mother goo away from one of the conduits to eliminate the countdown and let it run for an hour, one conduit had a purger doing nothing just 3ft away from some spawned in enemies, the middle conduit was clear of any enemies and the right conduit was just stocked with twenty radiants blowing away idle enemies.The MP is barren, that's never a good sign. wether by bad balance, bugs or just lack of player base. loosing MP so close to the launch is a horrible sign.I want this game to be sucessful, it shows promise. but at the rate this is going, and the lack of advertisment. the game is already ground to a hault. truth is....it's nothing new, the same old thing just in a different skin. if it had some kind of new mechanic or something along the lines of EaW Galaxy map then it'd be exceedingly enduring in the replayability. right now all it's got is a cheap half ♥♥♥♥♥ campaign and skirmish mode.....thats it. hell UAW was more unique than this game, and I seriously want a sequel to that game than have this.but the game is worth getting, there's no doubt about that, it's a solid RTS with good balance and unique gameplay styles for each faction.

												It's a decent RTS game and it felt actually good, after playing all the ""Company of Heroes"" games and clones. This one feels like a good old RTS, where you can actually build structures and manage resourses. Though the units of all factions are well balanced, they feels kind of the same with no regard of the actual faction. A thing or 2 change from faction to faction and grey goo itself is fun to play with too, but it gets boring after a bit.			"

												A beautiful and well balanced game in my opinion. I have played the single player for 10hours and the campaign is very nice! You end up playing the 3 races and you learn how to do their respective units and buildings. The videos ARE ONE OF THE BEST i've seen, i'm talking Blizzard style (for those who played blizzard games). Gameplay is fun but not addictive. I do not like competitive multiplayer so i cannot comment on that but the menus and layout (gui) are well made. All in all it is not a masterpiece but it is a game worth what is paid (25$).8/10Edit : Just finished the campaign and I LOVED IT! I sincerely hope there's a next instalment to this, the end was very nice and i ended up asking myself more questions.			"

												CAMPAIGNWhile the campaign is not much more than proving ground for your up and coming battles onine  it still has it merits. Lush, diverse environments, very well thought out maps, a short story but the landscape tells enough to strech it out, no sloppy excuses to wage war here.BASE BUILDINGEach race has it's own unique building format allowing for a completely dfferent play style in base building, be it dispersed, centralised or deadly mobile baby belching carnage.UNITSThe one down fall this game may have is it's units diversity. Each race can build a max of 200 and although each unit may look different each approach is very similar, you have several sets of upgradable abilities that are revesable / interchangable. In this game no unit has it's own micromanagement bar the epic, it comes down to your ability to control the sway of war not how quick you can bash a spell button.MAP EDITORThe map editor is second to none, this is where the game really shines. Build the ultimate skirmish map or even deisgn your own campaign with almost no limits. Such a varied and vibrant world, you can even import your own prefabs and textures and dish out a decent set of instructions to your AI factions. though the editor does not come without a few minor bugs., well... just. SAVE OFTEN..lolMULTIPLAYERAs yet i have not dealt with the multiplayer side of things bar the map making. I have heard it was randomly crashing though from what i read grey goo has been fixing/fixed the issue, they run tournaments for cash say $75000 to win? so issues can't be to prolific. The fan base is growing so you should expect more and more to log in for war, at present the online number can be a little low from what i hear.This game has come from a few of the ppl from Westwood before EA fked it, so it will have some old school feel n appeal for some.Enjoy!( i got it on sale via the free weekend )			"

												Great to see classic RTS made in such great quality! All what we love in RTS from the past is here: base building, troops training without any cap, resource collecting - all that is so refreshing now, compared to ""new innovative casual RTS"". It's been so long, since we all could play a PROPER RTS game!!!What impressed me most - is how it is friendly to newcomers to both RTS genre as a whole and to standard RTS we played in the past:- great single player campaign with very very nice quality CGI cut-scenes lets you get used to all mechanics gradually- don't want to wait and learn by practice? GREATEST way to handle complete newcomers: very detailed encyclopedia: will teach you how to play RTS as a whole (have 8 minutes video lesson with lots of useful hints), if it is your firts game of this genre. - veteran of RTS? Only interested in multiplayer? But need to know what units are about? Complete tech tree with all units, structures and upgrades, with stats, decruptions and balance. Spend some time reading and here you go - jump into multiplayer- tools for creating your own maps and campaigns. Want to surprise the world with your story and missions? Create and share them. Play in maps other players create.So the way how game handles both veterans and complete newcomers is amazing. That for me is some kind of standard now, how it should be done in any other next strategy game. The factions are nice, Goo faction is very interesting to explore and see how it plays. So if you want the classic experience from Command and Conquer original games, with some new gameplay mechanics, you definetely will found yourself spent into the game lots of hours :) I'm sure this game has great potential and future ahead.And once again thanks a lot to Steam for having such free weekends when we can find and try such interesting games!

												I've been playing this during the free preview and was most definitely impressed. Doesn't deserve the ""mixed"" rating. Great for casual RTS fans. Really clean looking/running and not overly complicated like StarCraft. The story seems great, and the animation good quality as well. Kind of remidns me of old FMV games the way they narrate between missions, but done correctly.I don't have the $20 to buy this during the sale, wich I regret but I'll definitely be picking this up when I have more disposable cash. It's well worth even the full asking price.			"

												I definetly recommend it to people who love strategy and like to be challenged. I'll go into detail on what I like and what I think could be improved upon.What do I enjoy?-Graphics -Gameplay-Campaign (Very interesting story plus it is a lot of fun)-Epic Units (Each faction gets an ""Epic Unit"" which can be used to wreck havoc amongst your enemies in a, well, epic way!)-Balanced Factions (The factions, Beta, Human, and Goo, are pretty balanced with each having flaws and strengths.)-Music (I know this isn't that major but I have to put it in because the music for Grey Goo is simply amazing)What do I dislike?-Lack of maps (While this game has downloadable maps and the maps that it comes with are very fun, there needs to be more. I would love to have more maps that come with the game.)-Longer Campaign (There isn't any other way of putting this than simply saying that the campaign is semi-long but it would be awesome for it to be longer)-New Factions? (It would be cool to have some new factions but the current factions are amazing.)Overall I would greatly recommend the game because you will greatly enjoy it. Plus, if you want, we can do a skirmish and I can teach you some things ;).			"

												So when I first bought this game, I was expecting to find a generic RTS, set in a future time. After much fumbling around as the game was 'out of range' for my monitor and contacting customer support (which is great by the way), I was able to play the game. Unsurprisingly, what I wanted was what I got. I've put about ~16 hours into the game so far, and have enjoyed the vast majority of the campaigns so far. The final mission in the Beta campaign is a real ♥♥♥♥♥ to complete, but is possible. Aside from this, I have been doing a lot of silly stuff in the skirmish mode, for example using mother goo to consume entire enemy bases, but yet again, have had a lot of fun doing so. I have not encountered any bugs or problems so far, although the game occasionally crashes (on average one every six hours, so not too bad). However, the campaign does get a little bit 'samey' as most of it is 'Destroy all the enemies', although this is to be expected.Finally, I really enjoy the cutscenes, as they are top quality, and are basically the line between CGI and greenscreened cutscenes, as they are really that good.In conclusion, I find this game very enjoyable so far, and reccomend it to anyone who wants a slower paced RTS with an excellent storyline and top notch cutscenes. I say this game is very goo'd and give it a 8 / 10 For asymmetry, interesting story and brilliant customer service.			"

I found all 3 races to be well balanced and played very well.The movie segments of the game are awesome and left me wanting more, i often stayed up late just to play one more mission. This is something alot of games these days don't make me want to to do. I am left hanging for a sequal now after finishing the game. I have not checked out out the MP so can't make comment.			"

												When the game works, it works well.  However, a lot of the time you will find your units shooting a stray wall post instead of attacking the enemy pelting them two feet behind them.  For a game who's goal was to not be the ""twitch APM"" style of game that StarCraft is, your army often requires a LOT of babysitting to be effective. While it is true you don't have to micromanage your base much, I feel like there are a few inherently broken things.  When attacking, especially if there are walls, your units like to clump up to shoot the wall post they could just walk past and become perfect artillery bait...  And even a single artillery unit can annihalate your light troops.  It doesn't help that the AI -always- has artillery pre-placed in perfect ""gotcha"" positions.  Brush also seems to be a problem.  The AI seems to have issues when being shot at by something.  In most RTS games, if a unit gets shot at from something outside its range it will still attempt to engage so it doesn't just die in vain.  In Grey Goo they just... stand there.  Same for things attacking them from inside brush.  The game notifies you they're under attack.  But they just stand there dumbfounded as lasers rip them apart from inside the woods because they can't see the unit inside unless they move into the brush as well, or have a detector with them.I have found that playing through the campaign requires several restarts until you find the ""perfect"" build order.  Mistakes are punished hard as the AI with all of their already completed and entrenched positions vs you starting with literally nothing means you have no breathing room what so ever.  The maps, however, are small for the most part so restarting usually isn't that bad unless you fail right at the end.  Also many of them are snaked with frustrating impassible terrain that can make fighting the grey goo a frustrating lesson in chase the mothers around the map since they can freely cross terrain that is impassible to the other races and are constantly spawning more mothers.Those issues aside though, I still mostly have fun with it.  I'm not even sure why.  I'm definitly not a pro RTS player and I've even had to just stop playing several times after having to restart the same mission three or four times in a row because I'm not playing the game at the pace the AI wants me to play so I wind up with auto-loss when it assaults required mission objectives before I'm anywhere near ready to defend them.  Maybe it's just because I don't want to lose and keep coming back just to beat it...  I think maybe if I can break out of the Supreme Commander mindset and learn that the campaign triggers aren't going to wait for me like Supreme Commander's do and I'll do better.  Or maybe I'm just easily amused by the pretty particle effects and animations, but despite all of the game's weaknesses I don't hate it.			"

												When the selection for good RTS games are very limited Grey Goo comes out, and it's not bad at all. In this day when there are not to many great ""fictional"" RTS games out there a game like Grey Goo is very refreshing. The AI is formidable though in the campaing on normal level there are some missions where the difficulty jumps way up into the hard category. The interface is pretty easy to use and there are a good variety of units with upgrades that help increase the overall variety. I personally think the amount of units each faction has is perfect. This game may deserve a spot up there with the greats like C&C Geneerals and Starcraft 2, though I will reserve that spot until I see what expansions they bring to the game. I just hope they come out with loads of skirmish maps that are adaptable to both single and multiplayer. "

												This game needs a lot of tweaking and improvements to cater for RTS players. I came in with a ready mind (comming from a broodwar background) for a new RTS  to sink my time into.As an example the tech is limited to only allowing you to defend or attack not both. The tech tree is very basic which only adds to the dissatisfaction of the hour put into the battle only to have to quit. This game deserves tweaking and improvements which I hope this original game gets; as it has a lot of potential.			"

												Grey Goo is one of those games where a few things are really well-developed, and then other things make you go ""Really?  C'mon....""  The graphics are pretty good, and the CGI is eye-popping since WETA Workshop was in charge.  Even so, there were a few times I ran into graphical bugs.  One of them was rather severe, as parts of my goo-soldiers reached up into the ""sky"" where my face was to obscure my vision.  This vibe of ""quality, but....""  is pretty pervasive throughout the game.  The story isn't particularly special, but perfectly serviceable for a game like this.  The few characters are two-dimensional.  My problem was its sloppy deliverance.  You feel as though you arrive 20% of the way into the story, and the back-lore presented later is surprisingly barren.  Given the basically non-existent ending, I get the feeling they're hoping to flesh a lot of things out in future installments.  There are three races to play.  Architecture is modular for the Humans and the Beta.  Although the Humans can teleport their buildings to elsewhere on their grid network, and in spite of the wonderful visual differences between the two styles, they are nonetheless painfully similar to each other.  The Goo is a marked difference, with no buildings whatsoever.  It simply partitions itself when it's gathered enough resources.  The UI is kind of terrible.  While it's been simplified for the purpose of building structures and units, there is a bewildering number of hotkeys in the game because the developers just couldn't be bothered.  Every unit has basic functions like patrolling or attacking the ground, but they don't exist on the UI.  If you don't remember the hotkeys, you have to go into the ESC menu.  The building rotation feature is absolutely terrible.  Beta structures have individual power hubs that you place and build off of, and while the feature of ""a blocked building"" is appreciated, once you let go of the rotation key it places the building.  A lot of times there are simply bad spots no matter what way you rotate, and you are forced to place the design and then delete it, rather than simply taking your hand off the key.  Also, I have to complain about the Human's Large Factory.  In order to build their epic unit (or simply attach all four of the tech hubs), in theory you just need to lead a power conduit to the rear of the structure.  This doesn't happen though, because the Human snap-to grid is awful, and automatically attaches the structure by its SIDE to the conduit, obscuring one of the tech hub slots.  Rotation of the building does NOT FIX THIS.  What this means is you have to build a grid, place the building, build more grid around the back, and then DELETE other parts of the conduit.  That's about as inefficient as it could possibly be.  The game also didn't really try with tutorials (or they simply didn't hold your hand).  Normally I'd be fine with that, and anyone with RTS experience will figure most of it out anyway, but an option to review tips would have been nice.  Once, I clicked a tutorial of the Epic unit I had to build for the Beta, but had other concerns at the time (the game has NO PAUSE BUTTON), so I had to click it away.  It then disappeared.  Permanently.  I had to look up on the internet exactly how the structure was built, because the game's ""Encyclopedia"" didn't want to tell me.  There are no hero units.  Units themselves are varied and have particular traits, but these are limited mostly to ranges and ground and/or air capabilities.  They have no abilities, however, and this severely limits the depth of the game.  Whoever has the most guys wins.  For the tech trees, you get to pick 4 of 12 upgrades.  That's it.  And you can't pick two in the same category.  At least some of these techs are shared between the races.  You do get the ability to unlearn a tech and learn another one in its category, but really?  FOUR TECHS?  The environmental details bring a little more strategy to the game.  Elevation matters in terms of visibility.  There are small forests of cover for units to hide in, though I imagine that against a human player, those are going to be the first places checked.  You can build actual WALLS in the game instead of just turrets.  The Goo can scale impossible cliffs in their gelatinous form, and for any race, tapping into another resource pool does not require a ""Town Hall"" type of structure.  The AI is a little shoddy.  I've had enemy units wander pretty close to my own and go by unassailed, and my units have done the same.  I never used the patrol function, so maybe that has something to do with it. Basically all campaign missions feel heavily scripted rather than intelligent.  In any case, the AI is exploitable, but really, how intelligent did it have to be when the game is about throwing endless units at a problem?  Oh, I almost forgot --- lots of people complain the game is difficult.  I have concluded these are probably teenagers or young twenty-somethings who never played any of the old RTS games.  By no stretch of the imagination is the game hard on the middle setting, though there are a few missions which are trial and error.  Those particular missions should have had better coordination and presentation of information, but by no means is the game ""hard"".  Overall, the game is a solid quick-fix for RTS fans, with really nice production value, even if the mechanics should have been so much more than they were.  Specifically hard stopping the story so they could lead it into a sequel was not appreciated.  The game itself is about 16 hours or so, and that's with several restarts of certain missions.  Overall it's fun, but it won't inspire you to dump tons of hours into it.			"

												CAMPAIGNWhile the campaign is not much more than proving ground for your up and coming battles onine  it still has it merits. Lush, diverse environments, very well thought out maps, a short story but the landscape tells enough to strech it out, no sloppy excuses to wage war here.BASE BUILDINGEach race has it's own unique building format allowing for a completely dfferent play style in base building, be it dispersed, centralised or deadly mobile baby belching carnage.UNITSThe one down fall this game may have is it's units diversity. Each race can build a max of 200 and although each unit may look different each approach is very similar, you have several sets of upgradable abilities that are revesable / interchangable.

												The factions are cool and each feel different to play. I really like that you can actually defend (except for the Goo). The campaign isn't that long and there's a low multiplayer population. If you like RTS but not StarCraft, then you'll probably like this. Get it on a sale.			"

												A beautiful and well balanced game in my opinion. I have played the single player for 10hours and the campaign is very nice! You end up playing the 3 races and you learn how to do their respective units and buildings. The videos ARE ONE OF THE BEST i've seen, i'm talking Blizzard style (for those who played blizzard games). Gameplay is fun but not addictive. I do not like competitive multiplayer so i cannot comment on that but the menus and layout (gui) are well made. All in all it is not a masterpiece but it is a game worth what is paid (25$).8/10Edit : Just finished the campaign and I LOVED IT! I sincerely hope there's a next instalment to this, the end was very nice and i ended up asking myself more questions.			"

												Great to see classic RTS made in such great quality! All what we love in RTS from the past is here: base building, troops training without any cap, resource collecting - all that is so refreshing now, compared to ""new innovative casual RTS"". It's been so long, since we all could play a PROPER RTS game!!!What impressed me most - is how it is friendly to newcomers to both RTS genre as a whole and to standard RTS we played in the past:- great single player campaign with very very nice quality CGI cut-scenes lets you get used to all mechanics gradually- don't want to wait and learn by practice? GREATEST way to handle complete newcomers: very detailed encyclopedia: will teach you how to play RTS as a whole (have 8 minutes video lesson with lots of useful hints), if it is your firts game of this genre. - veteran of RTS? Only interested in multiplayer? But need to know what units are about? Complete tech tree with all units, structures and upgrades, with stats, decruptions and balance. Spend some time reading and here you go - jump into multiplayer- tools for creating your own maps and campaigns. Want to surprise the world with your story and missions? Create and share them. Play in maps other players create.So the way how game handles both veterans and complete newcomers is amazing. That for me is some kind of standard now, how it should be done in any other next strategy game. The factions are nice, Goo faction is very interesting to explore and see how it plays. So if you want the classic experience from Command and Conquer original games, with some new gameplay mechanics, you definetely will found yourself spent into the game lots of hours :) I'm sure this game has great potential and future ahead.And once again thanks a lot to Steam for having such free weekends when we can find and try such interesting games!

												CAMPAIGNWhile the campaign is not much more than proving ground for your up and coming battles onine  it still has it merits. Lush, diverse environments, very well thought out maps, a short story but the landscape tells enough to strech it out, no sloppy excuses to wage war here.BASE BUILDINGEach race has it's own unique building format allowing for a completely dfferent play style in base building, be it dispersed, centralised or deadly mobile baby belching carnage.UNITSThe one down fall this game may have is it's units diversity. Each race can build a max of 200 and although each unit may look different each approach is very similar, you have several sets of upgradable abilities that are revesable / interchangable.

Really clean looking/running and not overly complicated like StarCraft. The story seems great, and the animation good quality as well. Kind of remidns me of old FMV games the way they narrate between missions, but done correctly.I don't have the $20 to buy this during the sale, wich I regret but I'll definitely be picking this up when I have more disposable cash. It's well worth even the full asking price.			"

												This game is an RTS that is beautifully animated. If you like the old Warcraft III, The Frozen Throne, Star Craft and Civilization, You're gonna love this game. The plot is quite intresting with diffrent short cinematic scenes appearing as you progress through a level and it is fully voice acted as well. It has very intresting game mechanics similar to Dota 2 and Leugue of Legends where the player can spot enemy forces on elevated ground and can set up an ambush by hiding in certain forests. Although it is a good game it still has some flaws. It is not very polished and can cause random crashes if you Alt+Tab too much. The balancing of the races is too much in favour of the Beta and the Goo. The humans are just really weak. Finaly, the game takes a long, long time to load. it differs from pc to pc but in my experience with all graohics settings on lowest, it takes about 7 minutes to load.....Thats a long time....I really reccomend you go check it out anyways. It is a good, solid game and I hope the will patch up and polish out their flaws in later updates and patches.			"

												Awesome RTS game.  Maybe not as good and Total Annihilation/Supreme Commander but still very enjoyable.  Maps max out at 4 players which is ok at first but quickly find myself wanting larger maps for 6-8 players.  Hopefully I can find some custom maps that wil fill this void.  Also this game is expensive at $50 and would be a much better buy at $30 or 4 copies for $100.  Regardless of those negatives I'm still very pleased with the purchase and would buy again.			"

												The game is fun but a longer and more conclusive storyline would have been more fitting for such a high price tag. The game mechanics are reasonably simple however this also contributes to the games major short coming that the units have no depth. Ultimately it boils down to who has the larger shinier death ball.I would recommend this game loosely. If you are able to pick it up on sale then by all means you'll have a great time for the price you paid.			"

												Have been replaying a lot of my old RTS's like Command and Conquer Generals, for awhile now just wishing that something new would soon pop up and that's when I first saw Grey Goo.I just new that it would be a great game so when it lunched i didn't hesitate for one sec to buy it.And how was it ?It was booth better and in some caces worse then i Thought. I really love how the three factions play and how all of the have thire own style in both building strategys and unit combat strategys But it is kind of sad that if a Goo player rushes you in the begining, as a Human it is verry, and I mean verry hard to handel it just because of the Big destruction a Mother goo does to the power conduits which makes it imposible to continue anything as nothing have power.I'm also do not like how weak the AI is on Hard setting. even with different AI personalities they still usually play out the whole game with one rush in the beginning and then a big atack at the middel and then nothing. But as the game is still verry fun and that i'v been playing alot with one of my friends it's just a minor problem for me.Campaing/Story.As I have not played verry much on the story mode I can't really say anymore than it feels quite basic as an RTS Campaign with good and clear mishon setup and Nice cutscens here and there.Overall I'm tottaly glad I bought the game and I hope the makers and community			"

												IT'S C&C IN SPACE!----------------------------------------Pros:+ Real-time strategy.+ More focused on macro than on micro.+ Great soundtrack. Seriously great.+ 3 races with different play styles.+ Refreshing interface approach, I like it.Cons:- Campaign missions are frustrating too often (worst offender so far: 5th Beta mission. wtf!?)- Units feel too similar (per race) and too replaceable. There is no unit that I'd call my favorite.----------------------------------------Not an outstanding game, but still a good game.

												Fantastic game. Everyone is saying if you enjoy old school RTS like c&c then you will like this and for the most part that is true. There are some minor issues that might need overlooking however:1. A tad to expensive, (maybe $10/15 cheaper would feel about right)2. Few crashes here and there, (did not really happen that much to me, a few times)3. A few small ballance issues, such as a really hard level on easy, which is crazy hard on medium...4. For some reason multiplayer does not seem to work for me, cant find any matches at all??Otherwise this is a great game that I am enjoying the new IP. Great graphics - great sound design - great level design - decent story so far....In a world lacking in new RTS games I am just happy to have something new to play!			"

												Mixed Review,I have spent a little time in the game now both multi-player, coop, and single player. There are some definite pros and cons to this game.I know it is still early in its development so I will be gentle. I will admit that I have not researched this game a whole lot but I have always been a fan of RTS games and purchase them all of the time. As far as RTS games are concerned this one is a pretty game. The movies/cut screens are pretty solid. Game loading time is okay. It runs pretty smooth in the beginning but can get a little laggy towards the end.Overall the biggest issues I have are the current price of $50. In its current state this is far from a $50 game for what you get in return. Personally I like the human faction and to only get 10 units to pick from and only be able to build almost as many structures is a little boring to say the least. Sure I have tinkered with the other 2 factions but I am sticking to humans as that is my game style. When running the campaign it would be nice to be able to select which faction you would like to play for. It starts you off with the Beta faction. I am not sure what happens past that as I have not gotten that far yet.Over all, it is safe to say that this is a good game but it is definitely lacking in some areas and it is not a $50 game. I am hoping that the money that we spend on it will be used to add new content as time goes on and if we are charged for that content it will be extremely disappointing.			"

												I definetly recommend it to people who love strategy and like to be challenged. I'll go into detail on what I like and what I think could be improved upon.What do I enjoy?-Graphics -Gameplay-Campaign (Very interesting story plus it is a lot of fun)-Epic Units (Each faction gets an ""Epic Unit"" which can be used to wreck havoc amongst your enemies in a, well, epic way!)-Balanced Factions (The factions, Beta, Human, and Goo, are pretty balanced with each having flaws and strengths.)-Music (I know this isn't that major but I have to put it in because the music for Grey Goo is simply amazing)What do I dislike?-Lack of maps (While this game has downloadable maps and the maps that it comes with are very fun, there needs to be more. I would love to have more maps that come with the game.)-Longer Campaign (There isn't any other way of putting this than simply saying that the campaign is semi-long but it would be awesome for it to be longer)-New Factions? (It would be cool to have some new factions but the current factions are amazing.)Overall I would greatly recommend the game because you will greatly enjoy it.

												So when I first bought this game, I was expecting to find a generic RTS, set in a future time. After much fumbling around as the game was 'out of range' for my monitor and contacting customer support (which is great by the way), I was able to play the game. Unsurprisingly, what I wanted was what I got. I've put about ~16 hours into the game so far, and have enjoyed the vast majority of the campaigns so far. The final mission in the Beta campaign is a real ♥♥♥♥♥ to complete, but is possible. Aside from this, I have been doing a lot of silly stuff in the skirmish mode, for example using mother goo to consume entire enemy bases, but yet again, have had a lot of fun doing so. I have not encountered any bugs or problems so far, although the game occasionally crashes (on average one every six hours, so not too bad). However, the campaign does get a little bit 'samey' as most of it is 'Destroy all the enemies', although this is to be expected.Finally, I really enjoy the cutscenes, as they are top quality, and are basically the line between CGI and greenscreened cutscenes, as they are really that good.In conclusion, I find this game very enjoyable so far, and reccomend it to anyone who wants a slower paced RTS with an excellent storyline and top notch cutscenes. I say this game is very goo'd and give it a 8 / 10 For asymmetry, interesting story and brilliant customer service.			"

												Firstly, I love this game. The game is well made with a great story. I found all 3 races to be well balanced and played very well.The movie segments of the game are awesome and left me wanting more, i often stayed up late just to play one more mission. This is something alot of games these days don't make me want to to do. I am left hanging for a sequal now after finishing the game. I have not checked out out the MP so can't make comment.			"

												When the game works, it works well.  However, a lot of the time you will find your units shooting a stray wall post instead of attacking the enemy pelting them two feet behind them.  For a game who's goal was to not be the ""twitch APM"" style of game that StarCraft is, your army often requires a LOT of babysitting to be effective. While it is true you don't have to micromanage your base much, I feel like there are a few inherently broken things.  When attacking, especially if there are walls, your units like to clump up to shoot the wall post they could just walk past and become perfect artillery bait...  And even a single artillery unit can annihalate your light troops.  It doesn't help that the AI -always- has artillery pre-placed in perfect ""gotcha"" positions.  Brush also seems to be a problem.  The AI seems to have issues when being shot at by something.  In most RTS games, if a unit gets shot at from something outside its range it will still attempt to engage so it doesn't just die in vain.  In Grey Goo they just... stand there.  Same for things attacking them from inside brush.  The game notifies you they're under attack.  But they just stand there dumbfounded as lasers rip them apart from inside the woods because they can't see the unit inside unless they move into the brush as well, or have a detector with them.I have found that playing through the campaign requires several restarts until you find the ""perfect"" build order.  Mistakes are punished hard as the AI with all of their already completed and entrenched positions vs you starting with literally nothing means you have no breathing room what so ever.  The maps, however, are small for the most part so restarting usually isn't that bad unless you fail right at the end.  Also many of them are snaked with frustrating impassible terrain that can make fighting the grey goo a frustrating lesson in chase the mothers around the map since they can freely cross terrain that is impassible to the other races and are constantly spawning more mothers.Those issues aside though, I still mostly have fun with it.  I'm not even sure why.  I'm definitly not a pro RTS player and I've even had to just stop playing several times after having to restart the same mission three or four times in a row because I'm not playing the game at the pace the AI wants me to play so I wind up with auto-loss when it assaults required mission objectives before I'm anywhere near ready to defend them.  Maybe it's just because I don't want to lose and keep coming back just to beat it...  I think maybe if I can break out of the Supreme Commander mindset and learn that the campaign triggers aren't going to wait for me like Supreme Commander's do and I'll do better.  Or maybe I'm just easily amused by the pretty particle effects and animations, but despite all of the game's weaknesses I don't hate it.			"

												Surprisingly good (macro-focussed) RTS. If StarCraft and Command & Conquer had a love-child, this would be it. Incredibly polished cinematics and art with extremely good voice acting. The storyline keeps you engaged and keeps you wanting more, each time you complete a mission. The singleplayer campaign, however, is somewhat short; 15 missions. But, play it on Normal or Hard and you'll have many hours of fun. This is a MUST-BUY for those who play RTS for the singleplayer/story campaigns; the universe/characters Grey Goo creates are on par with some of the biggest names in the business. For a long weekend, this was the perfect game to have. I believe they came out with a DLC that adds 3 (yes, just three) missions to the campaign. While I'm itching to find out what happens next in the story, I don't think I'm quite ready to shell out another $8 to find out. Try it; you won't be disappointed.			"

												This is a great throwback to original RTS while being current. The storyline is great and the different factions can suit almost any type of game style ( agressive, passive, turtle, etc.,)  Units are good, gameplay is amazing (IMO), graphics are great. It's an overall 10/10. I had issues starting the game, but after a while it loaded fine. Not sure if it was a glitch or not, but it seems to be fixed.The fact that they are working on this game, releasing patches to make game better, making it interactive with the online community, and such is a great way to get involve with the community and get the community involved.

												This game is an RTS that is beautifully animated. If you like the old Warcraft III, The Frozen Throne, Star Craft and Civilization, You're gonna love this game. The plot is quite intresting with diffrent short cinematic scenes appearing as you progress through a level and it is fully voice acted as well. It has very intresting game mechanics similar to Dota 2 and Leugue of Legends where the player can spot enemy forces on elevated ground and can set up an ambush by hiding in certain forests. Although it is a good game it still has some flaws. It is not very polished and can cause random crashes if you Alt+Tab too much. The balancing of the races is too much in favour of the Beta and the Goo. The humans are just really weak. Finaly, the game takes a long, long time to load. it differs from pc to pc but in my experience with all graohics settings on lowest, it takes about 7 minutes to load.....Thats a long time....I really reccomend you go check it out anyways. It is a good, solid game and I hope the will patch up and polish out their flaws in later updates and patches.			"

												Awesome RTS game.  Maybe not as good and Total Annihilation/Supreme Commander but still very enjoyable.  Maps max out at 4 players which is ok at first but quickly find myself wanting larger maps for 6-8 players.  Hopefully I can find some custom maps that wil fill this void.  Also this game is expensive at $50 and would be a much better buy at $30 or 4 copies for $100.  Regardless of those negatives I'm still very pleased with the purchase and would buy again.			"

												Played this for one of the play for free weekends and just finished. I like the story quite a bit, and I think it is one reason why you should play the game. However I don't see how you could sink hundreds of hours into it. Looking at the price regular it is steep. I'd say no less then $20 for the game which is what is on sale at the moment. Good game though, diverse races, each having their strengths. Also each one has their own UI's which is a nice touch. Personally I like the Beta due to being able to drop down anywhere on the map.

												Played on the free weekend,  Thanks Petroglyph, Greybox and Steam.  Shiny shiny graphics, and the cutscenes are top notch with great voice acting, linking the missions in the SP in a meaningful way with an interesting story.  The 'tips as you go method' of tutorial is nice and user friendly without forcing you to go through the usual step by step 'now press C to crouch' a lot of games resort to when theres lots to tell, instead we get a bit more show, which helps you remain interested.Level maps are full of moving scenery and wildlife fly through the map as you battle it out, giving the landscape a more realistic feel than the old C&C games ever managed.  Now that I mention C&C though, we come to the negative.  Grey Goo feels exactly like Tiberium wars or Generals albeit with lovely graphics and modern unit design.  I found myself playing the game exactly as if I was playing one of those games.  It's encouraging when the worst thing I have to complain about is that Grey Goo is similar to some classic RTS games which I know and love, but there you are, it didnt feel different enough to establish its own vibe despite everyones best efforts with the exciting music, and did I mention how nice the graphics are?Only other minor quibble, having upgraded a base to the point you acquire a major technology, you cannot then build that major tech in a new facility unless it is similarly upgraded.  Example : I decided I would build bombers, so you need a hub large enough to accommodate an aircraft hanger, a factory, an air upgrade and an artillery upgrade.  Want any more than four bombers at a time, you gotta build all that again, just building a hub and hanger wont do.  I'm prepared to do that, but it slows things down if you need to build that much infrastructure to advance a strategy when you could just build a small hub, and a large factory and mass produce cheaper faster land units, and repeat, and repeat.So my free weekend experience, while I liked the game, I only played three levels and feel I have seen enough. I didnt want to stick round to see the titans or try multiplayer or finish the story, ultimately I wasnt that excited and unfortunately I'm taking Grey Goo off my wishlist and calling it a day.However.  I do give a thumbs up, I do recommend the game, theres no real downside to it and if you pick it up at a good price I'm sure lots of people will have lots of fun, it just wasnt for me.			"

												It's a nice classic RTS with a nice sory. Nothing special in regards to either gameplay or story. Classic Sci-Fi in every regards. But that's not a bad thing. It's great game if it can be bought for half price but at full price it's a little basic.Positiv:- Challenging AI on medium and higher difficulty- Clean graphics- Great music- Nice storyNegativ:- Only 2v2 in skrimish or multiplayer (Limited replay value)- Skirmish and multiplayer maps all pretty much 100% symmetrical and therefor don't feel ""organic""- Unit design a bit on the boring side (humans especially)- Sound effects somewhat ""retro"" (COH2 for example sounds much better in respect to gunfire and explosions etc.)All in all a nice RTS but not a game that will remain in your memory or on your harddrive once the story is completed. In regards to skirmish and multiplayer there is much better.			"

												Wow.  The campaign story was great!  Interesting twist on the Fermi Paradox, and the Grey Goo scenario, and solid gameplay.  The number of sciency references is great, though I think a lot of people will miss those.I've gotta say that even normal mode on the campaign is HARD until you figure out how to play each race.  Haven't tried any PvP, but very interesting gameplay with respect to building.I think it would be extremely easy to underrate this title.  It's a good game from a small company. "

												Grey goo is a standard strategy game  3 factions Beta, Humans and Goo . Single player campaign is short and sweet the main characters  that introduce each  mission are beautifully rendered the Human character looks almost real.I am still working through it as the  missions as quite well put together and do pull you back to play a harder setting.I have 2 gripes so far the UI is not very good it has 3 sections for heavy light and air unit but each section has all the units,  all it does is highlight the units , seem like a waste of space. Also especially in the Human campaign I found the buildings a little confusing as they look quite simular several times I have placed a tank factory instead of a turret , they are not very good a destroying the enemy.Finally I think the tutorial leave big gaps which can leave you scratch your head as to why that has not worked eg tank factories need to be next the main factory which is clear in the Beta campaign as the are self contained units but the human campaign the factories are linked by conduits so logically you can put them anywhere .Anyway it is still an enjoyable game just don't pay full price  and wash your hands after playing as the Goo gets everywhere.

												Being a fan of warcraft back in the day and strategy games in general, I had high hopes for grey goo, and it certainly delivered.  However, it may not be the best game for you.Pros:-Graphics-Stock maps are good-Campaign is comprehensive tutorial wise (since that's really all it is)-Hard difficulty campaign is still a challenge however-Balance is pretty good-Relatively new, updates are quite likelyCons:-Relatively new and non-mainstream-As such, playerbase isn't all that huge-Some tech choices are objectively better or worse-Low map variety-AI is predictable and very bad at mid-late gameAnd now, there are a couple of key traits to this game that you might see as pros or cons, depending on how you like your RTS's.-Emphasis on map control and positioning over build path and micromanagement-Units are fairly parralell between races-Resource collection is automatic once you have the building done-Expanding is key to passing early game eco, and takes a lot of skill to do well-Units are fairly weak on their own-Buildings hold up well against early game rushes-Brush mechanicsTL;DR:Less micromanagement, more map control awareness.  It's lacking in maps, though it's very new and we can likely expect more.  8.75/10 from me, but it may or may not be your cup of tea personally.$50 is steep, check out some people playing the game to make sure or wait until it goes on sale.Also the humans are fantastically british.

												Oh how badly I want to give this game a good review...It looks so nice and was such a good throwback it had sooo much potential! The Good:Excellent feel, placing and controlling units is organic.HUD is insanely niceUnits are well balanced (we'll touch on this more later)Online community is friendlyTHE BAD:The meta is so hardcore it hurts""Legendary"" units are so broken that most players turtle until they can spam them. Then it's just you and them trading blows and it becomes a 1-2 hour♥♥♥♥♥♥fest of who can stockpile resources better and throw hunks of metal and the other person. 1/2 of that time is watchign your damn units move.The Goo faction HQ can be so hard to purge sometimes that you will spending 45 minutes looking for that last freaking mother goo when the game is over and you can't kill it. Campaign is shorter than Danny Devito in a water ditchBuild times are SOOOOOOOOOOO LONG I will constantly set my build order up and go make toast while they complete. The unit cheese is the only legit strategy. If you don't max out your population cap ASAP you lose.Final take: 7/10I like the feel of this game, and with the new option to turn off legendary units the game became IMMENSELY better. But the unit-unit counter system is a tad off. It would be better if they labeled them better and made it more orvious. Yes they are labeled but would it be easier to put AT not ""Strong against armoured units"". like rock paper scissors:Infantry>ATTank> infantryAT>TankEverything should be easy to counter, but the tanks are the most powerful unit by far. And the so called ""AT"" classes can barely fight against tanks. This game does not have a very good ""Oh he's building air well then I'll build AA and Tank"" or ""He's building tank infantry? Well then I'll build AT and Tank"" and this game desperatly needs it. "

												This game is quite same as starcraft, but I think that grey goo lacks something, you will feel that there is something missing.+balanced+asymetrical races, goo is quite original race+cinematics are really nice- When I tried load my campaign game and when everything loaded, I clicked on start and nothing happed I was still facing loading screen, but game was going on, I couldn´t see anything, I couldn´t do anything and I lost. I tried it multipletimes, but saving your game is quite waste of time.- when you end campaign as beta, you will be like ""That´s it? Where was epic last mission?""- building wires as human is pretty annoying when you consider fact, that you can build it only to + not to x- stupid goo hunting lasts more time then it should- you can´t set priorities to construct buildings as human, basicaly you have to wait after your mining facilities are build and after that you can make factory, it is really stupid.overall I would recommend it but, you have to prepare for some rages after you will be hunting one stupid goo for an hour etc.7/10			"

												Have been replaying a lot of my old RTS's like Command and Conquer Generals, for awhile now just wishing that something new would soon pop up and that's when I first saw Grey Goo.I just new that it would be a great game so when it lunched i didn't hesitate for one sec to buy it.And how was it ?It was booth better and in some caces worse then i Thought. I really love how the three factions play and how all of the have thire own style in both building strategys and unit combat strategys But it is kind of sad that if a Goo player rushes you in the begining, as a Human it is verry, and I mean verry hard to handel it just because of the Big destruction a Mother goo does to the power conduits which makes it imposible to continue anything as nothing have power.I'm also do not like how weak the AI is on Hard setting. even with different AI personalities they still usually play out the whole game with one rush in the beginning and then a big atack at the middel and then nothing. But as the game is still verry fun and that i'v been playing alot with one of my friends it's just a minor problem for me.Campaing/Story.As I have not played verry much on the story mode I can't really say anymore than it feels quite basic as an RTS Campaign with good and clear mishon setup and Nice cutscens here and there.Overall I'm tottaly glad I bought the game and I hope the makers and community			"

												IT'S C&C IN SPACE!----------------------------------------Pros:+ Real-time strategy.+ More focused on macro than on micro.+ Great soundtrack. Seriously great.+ 3 races with different play styles.+ Refreshing interface approach, I like it.Cons:- Campaign missions are frustrating too often (worst offender so far: 5th Beta mission. wtf!?)- Units feel too similar (per race) and too replaceable. There is no unit that I'd call my favorite.----------------------------------------Not an outstanding game, but still a good game. Also, we can't really be picky when it comes to RTS. ;)If you enjoyed C&C back in the old days, you will like this game!			"

												Fantastic game. Everyone is saying if you enjoy old school RTS like c&c then you will like this and for the most part that is true. There are some minor issues that might need overlooking however:1. A tad to expensive, (maybe $10/15 cheaper would feel about right)2. Few crashes here and there, (did not really happen that much to me, a few times)3. A few small ballance issues, such as a really hard level on easy, which is crazy hard on medium...4. For some reason multiplayer does not seem to work for me, cant find any matches at all??Otherwise this is a great game that I am enjoying the new IP. Great graphics - great sound design - great level design - decent story so far....In a world lacking in new RTS games I am just happy to have something new to play!			"

												Mixed Review,I have spent a little time in the game now both multi-player, coop, and single player. There are some definite pros and cons to this game.I know it is still early in its development so I will be gentle. I will admit that I have not researched this game a whole lot but I have always been a fan of RTS games and purchase them all of the time. As far as RTS games are concerned this one is a pretty game. The movies/cut screens are pretty solid. Game loading time is okay. It runs pretty smooth in the beginning but can get a little laggy towards the end.Overall the biggest issues I have are the current price of $50. In its current state this is far from a $50 game for what you get in return. Personally I like the human faction and to only get 10 units to pick from and only be able to build almost as many structures is a little boring to say the least. Sure I have tinkered with the other 2 factions but I am sticking to humans as that is my game style. When running the campaign it would be nice to be able to select which faction you would like to play for. It starts you off with the Beta faction. I am not sure what happens past that as I have not gotten that far yet.Over all, it is safe to say that this is a good game but it is definitely lacking in some areas and it is not a $50 game. I am hoping that the money that we spend on it will be used to add new content as time goes on and if we are charged for that content it will be extremely disappointing.			"

												Here's the deal... I really like this game. It's rare for a developer to not only make an RTS, but also a good story with it. Full of likeable characters, a great soundtrack and fun gameplay.Some possible spoilers below.Pros:1.) Solid, varied gameplay. All 3 sides are very different. Humanity, The Beta, and the Goo.2.) The Story is well thought out, with bits of backstory that really add to the experience. It leave me wanting more. I really hope there will be a sequel.3.) Mutliplayer is fun and fast paced. Not for people who want to turtle or play defensive games however. Expect most matches to end within 30-45 minutes, or possibly faster.4.) It's an RTS in an era that has forgotten this once great genre. I love supporting anyone willing to make a AAA RTS.It's not without it's issues however. The Multiplayer is very limited, just 1v1 or 2v2. The reason for this given by the developer is performance, which I can believe. However, I'd rather the developer just leave multiplayer open for the future, when more players have hardware capable of running the game well. I believe this is the chief reason for the game not being more successful than it is.Cons: 1.) Only 1v1 or 2v2. This limits the appeal of the multiplayer greatly. I really hope the dev opens up 3v3 and 4v4.2.) Micromanagement can be excessive. This is really a problem with most RTS games however.3.) Late game is dominated by high end units, like Epic units and heavy tank units. This tends to also be a weakness in RTS games. I would like to see tech 1 units stay useful in late game.4.) Story ends on a cliffhanger... I'm afraid that I won't get the whole story if we don't get a sequel.Overall, I really like this game and want more. It's easily accessible to Starcraft 2 and Command and Conquer fans, and has as enjoyable a story as SC2.8.5/10. 9/10 if you don't care about 3v3 and 4v4 multiplayer.			"

												Good looking and fun game.(I've had the game since day 1 and have played through the patches)In campaign remember that some catalyst (beta and human) you can build two extractors for 1 catalyst gyser if u build them on the edges of the catalyst gysers (or w/e they were called again).Pros:-fun and easy econ, easy controls, easy to pick up, no hidden damage types (basically damage + pen - armor = damage taken).-nice polish (graphics, UI wise) I never experienced any slowdown or random fps drops, 60 fps all day @ max 1080p small/no aa, no vsync-nerfed the op artillery-developer supported competitive play atm-minor micro skills can make you a better player, kiting, artillery ground bombardment, movng back damged units, etc...Cons:-A little too slow paced, some units could move faster, or if everybody starts with an extracter it could speed up gameplay (played all CNC games always hated that you start with no income generator). even with this implementation you could still go eco or army, just lower the starting money by like half an extractor or a full extractor.-small map pool-the praised AI is pretty weak actually, for me anyways.-so simplified i feel this might be a console port experiment, such as max of 4 players on maps. qwerty controls = axby, (nothing wrong with grids) but grid building layouts. etc...Long story short a solid RTS. If you like to play SC2, COH, CNC, SC-FA, then this is a game worth adding to your collection.			"

												Grey Goo is a real-time strategy game that allows newcomers to the RTS game and veterans to get a different perspective on the balance of each Civilization. The introduction of a completely mobile Civilization is odd but extremely welcoming. Everyone reaches to be the ultimate Goober. Spongebob would be proud. Grey Goo possesses the potential for an amazing story if it would expand it more. The universe painted is one of ambiguity and deception. It leaves a lot to want after defeating the campaign with only 5 missions for each faction. Desire it would seem is going to be the greatest tool the developers are going to use to make a sequel...or expansions. The Dark Ones are growing the Silence and all the factions are still at a loss for what to do in regards to teaming up or going at it separate ways. I give my tip of the hat to this game as an extreme advocate for games like AOE, Stronghold, EU, and everything in between. I love it and will be a Goofy Goober for times to come.			"

It looks and feels like a mashup between Command & Conquer 3, StarCraft 1, and other genre classics.The graphics and story are pretty decent, and the writing is overall good. It's got some fairly interesting bits to it. It is definitely a slower paced game than, say, StarCraft or DOTA, more in line with Age of Empires II.You really have to want to play games that feel like they took design decisions from 2003. Not saying that it's bad, just expect that slower pace is all.It's good.			"

												When the selection for good RTS games are very limited Grey Goo comes out, and it's not bad at all. In this day when there are not to many great ""fictional"" RTS games out there a game like Grey Goo is very refreshing. The AI is formidable though in the campaing on normal level there are some missions where the difficulty jumps way up into the hard category. The interface is pretty easy to use and there are a good variety of units with upgrades that help increase the overall variety. I personally think the amount of units each faction has is perfect. This game may deserve a spot up there with the greats like C&C Geneerals and Starcraft 2, though I will reserve that spot until I see what expansions they bring to the game. I just hope they come out with loads of skirmish maps that are adaptable to both single and multiplayer. "

												This game needs a lot of tweaking and improvements to cater for RTS players. I came in with a ready mind (comming from a broodwar background) for a new RTS  to sink my time into.As an example the tech is limited to only allowing you to defend or attack not both. The tech tree is very basic which only adds to the dissatisfaction of the hour put into the battle only to have to quit. This game deserves tweaking and improvements which I hope this original game gets; as it has a lot of potential.			"

												I had such high hopes for this game but they were dashed by the poorly designed and quite frankly stupid limitations to the factions. Take the Humans, they are limited to building on attached conduits for power, fair enough, but no, wait, this conduit only runs on 90 degree angles. Let's not mention that on most maps this a serious problem as you are placed on a diagnonal to the field of play. Meaning you have to zig-zag around just to build things. Another problem is the A.I., seriously moronic in game play but grossly overpowered in opening stages, forcing a defensive posture by the player, mearly to stay alive. Havesting resources require the use of ploding unarmed ""haresters"" yet the humans can teleport structures and with a teleporter units on the map.  Go figure? Clearly, humanity has lost all it's IQ points in the future for common sense.While the campaign missions are well thought out, goals are well defined and attainable, the skirmish aspect of the game is weakly developed and lacks an A.I. that is consisitent with the actual design of it's tactics. Put simply, the defensive A.I. attacks as frequently and with almost as much ferocity as the offensive version. This makes it difficult to enjoy the and learn the game due to all of the micromanagement one must do. The reason one would select a defensive A.I. initial is to learn how to build a base and a sizeable army, and only then, once you have the skills, do you step up to the more offensive A.I. I suppose you could select the idle A.I. but where's the fun in that?This game has a tremendous story to tell and could be a real winner but in it's current state I can hardly reccomend it. It has serious potential though and yet it is still early to give the final yea or nea. I'll withhold my final opinion to see how this game develops.			"

												I was planning to do a few positive reviews next so I didn't look like a complete cynical bitter old man... full of nothing but hatred for modern games and nostalgia for better days of a forgotten era... but then I played Grey Goo. It's the newest RTS from Petroglyph, and I can't believe all the high praise it's gotten. But I guess if CoD can get drooling fanboys... so can RTS games. If you don't know who these people are though, they're the people that made Universe At War... one of the most broken and miserable shovelwared games I've ever played. Do people even remember that game? It came from Petroglyph. So how can one hold much faith for their next project? For the record, I love the original CnC titles, and I loved Westwood. Those games are my favorite RTS games to this day, along with others(MECHCOMMANDER). But I'm not a fanboy of anything, so... this'll be what it'll be.Well, honestly and surprisingly, Grey Goo is no where near as much of a disaster as Universe At War. It actually works, has a somewhat convenient interface(leagues better than Universe At War), and amazing cutscenes. These cutscenes are some of the best I've seen in the industry, although I do not play EA or Activision titles(If you're going to mention a CoD, don't even bother). It almost makes me wish they would have made a movie instead... mainly because the game is still a bust. I would have loved a movie out of this. Also, the music is good. The composer they are still recycling from the CnC days(Frank Klepacki) still produces good work. Some tracks are still obvious remixes CnC1 tracks... which were also used in Universe At War... same music again and again more or less, but I can't complain about it. This game has a great soundtrack, plenty of new music, not too many remixes I'd say. But like Universe at War, I'll add the soundtrack in my collection, and abandon the game. I like the graphics, I like the music... I don't like much else.My positives basically end there for this game. What you'll notice right away is the lack of ANY originality in these races, which strikes the game right away. The Beta(military alien race) are ripped right off of Starcraft 2. They are literally a clone of the Terran marines. The guns, walkers, metal and paint styles, it's almost copy and paste. The Goo are basically Scrin from Tiberian Wars, but with a few puddles added. I bet most people didn't realize this since they probably didn't even play Tiberian Wars. But almost everything is a walker unit that looks ripped right out of Tiberian Wars. The Human faction uses a dual ripoff mixture. They have the building styles of the Scrin(again from Tiberian Wars) but the unit styles of the Novus(Universe At War). Look, this isn't baby's first video game for me. I know where you're ripping all of this stuff. I can tell when you made no attempt to do anything new at all, although I guess I could credit you for the faces and mini arms for the Beta(which are mainly in cutscenes, not the gameplay itself)The game controls like a typical RTS, at least with your Humans and Beta factions. But what kills it for me is how all of the units in the game are basically zerglings. No unit except the 1 limit epics have any kind of weight to them. It's like everything is wearing tissue paper and dies in 1-2 seconds each, no matter how big or small, and you just mass clown car out replacements rather than care about losses. Oh I lost 20 tanks in a <10 second long fight, whatever, just clown car out some more. People call this a ""return to classic RTS"" or such. Uh... why? In my old RTS games, it took you all day to build an army, but they had a weight to them, and you cared about losses. Units didn't drop like flies in combat, and you'd send them back to base to repair to preserve your limited resources. Fights lasted longer than a few seconds each. You made actual decisions with risks and consequences. There's none of that here. A) mass up a zerg, B) attack move it to the enemy base. Basically, it's SC 2, a fast paced action RTS that's more about button mashing/mass unit spam than anything else. I fail to find hardly any ""strategy"" even in it, even less than SC 2. Infested Planet, a game I love, is full of strategy, and so much more fun than this. Btw, half of the units feel like they serve no real purpose except to pad out the menus. The game was average to play... /yawn.Moving on to the story... it's totally nonsensical. My curiosity for it just feels like a waste of time now. The Beta and Humans fight for a while... for some reason. Don't expect them to tell you why. They don't even attempt diplomacy or negotiation until almost fully exterminating each other. Long after you've given up expecting any kind of peace due to all the killing, they suddenly truce out of the blue. The dumbchick Lucy(Human leader) pulls a 180 and suddenly wants to befriend the Beta after previously heartlessly murdering as many as possible without a second thought. I kid you not, in a previous mission, she downright refused trying to talk to them, literally saying ""NO"" to diplomacy, wanting you to just kill them all, then immediately afterwards, after killing everyone, says let's talk to them and try to help them. I mean, WTF? She is LITERALLY directly responsible for the next dire situation they're in, which SHE caused, then wants to help them with it so they'll trust her. I'm not making this up. This happens in the game. At first, for most of the game, I thought they didn't understand each other's language as well, then they suddenly do? So do you, or do you not? Make up your mind game. But they apparently already had the ability to translate the Beta language... they just decided not to do it for the longest time(FOR SOME REASON). So eventually the factions ally against the Goo, exactly as predicted, but only after murdering each other to the point of extinction first for no logical reason, then apparently viewing all their lost people or units as water under the bridge I guess... great characters. And these people are supposed to be your sympathic characters?So we get on to the Goo... at first I expect a Zerg plot. And that's what it is. But it's far more stupid. By the end of it, I was actually looking back on Blizzard's Xelnaga crackpot as a favorable memory. You see the Goo basically rip all of this off. At first you expect them to be the bad guys like the Zerg... and that would have made me happy... but suddenly they're not, because apparently there's an even bigger enemy out there that's the real one we should all be fighting. It's literally a bait and switch Xelnaga plot, just like Starcraft 2. This whole game ends on a cliffhanger BTW, as does the DLC, which only adds 3 whole maps, and doesn't continue or resolve ANYTHING from the main story, just like Kane's Wrath for Tiberian Wars. Btw, you get all this for 58$, which is only 18 levels in total.Exactly as predicted, this game didn't have a long life. It's already been forgotten by most people(even those that acted as if it was the next big thing at launch) and the multiplayer is drying up quickly. But why would you multiplayer this instead of SC2 anyway? This game is trying to Esport with ladder play, and that's just sad. Bunch of fools. I feel sorry for what Westwood has become. Instead of making classic RTS games again or trying anything new and original; they just want to copy Blizzard.In conclusion, I would not say Grey Goo is a terrible game. It's just an incredibly average or mediocre one, certainly not worth the 58$ they're asking for. If you really enjoy modern RTS games(MAINLY SC2), I'm sure you'll enjoy this, but I strongly recommend you get it discounted. But if you don't like SC2, stay far away from this. It's not a return to the RTS games of old as falsely touted by idiots all over Youtube or review sites; not even close. You could have spent 15$ on Infested Planet, which is incredible, or hell, 40$ day 1 for Legacy of the Void...			"

												Very prettty, extremely so in cut scenes. But your Unit AI is terrible, some will simply stop where they are, go a different direction to be slaughtered. There are no pings on the mini map so when you hear ""You're under attack"" you have to cycle through everything you own to find out where you're under attack. Stealth and artillery are great when you have enough time to coordinate everything, but only the comp AI can control 4 units at once. Random slow downs spoil the flow (I have an extremely fast gaming PC and it still slows down). No speed controls or issuing orders when paused. Unit selection can be tricky (esp on Epic units like Hand of Ruk). Very limited selection of units (which even so are ""Melee"", ""Seige"", ""Stealth"", ""Scout"" and ""Bomber""). Tech tree is none existant. Units are way too flimsy and there is no way of making them tougher (Which when you're units will change directions when blocked by their fellows, means moving large groups extremely frustrating - especially when you managed to do it you're usually decimated because of incredibly strong static defences). This game is currently in the state of ""Beta"" as far as all of these lacking features and bugs are concerned. Check back in several months and see if the comments have been improved before waisting your money on a game which is extremely frustrating.			"

												I wanted to like this game, and I do to a point love this game. The graphics are great and the factions are fun. The idea of a limited tech tree, where choices are locked in and you can't develop every option, is an aditional layer to the game. It is also where the game fails in my view. There is little in game to say: develop these techs for that unit. I'm sure it is in there some where, but I didn't find it. The other issue I had is in the skirmish games. My machine is really good, it is the best computer I have ever owned, but.... When I get too many units going in a skirmish game it crashes out.I played this game over a ""free weekend"" and was happy that I did, it saved me the money I was tempted to spend on it. Some one pointed out the ""hotkey"" system and loved it. I didn't use it so much but can see how it would be an easy factor to love.If I had to give it an out of 10 rating? A solid 5.Lots to love, but just as much to get frustrated with.			"

												This game has some of the best CG/Mocap facial animations out there.  Sadly, they spent 90% of their budget on this and the actual game is very lacking.The UI is bulky, takes up way too much room on screen, and often gets in the way of gameplay.  Then there are the dumb things like ALL factories have to be on repeat or none.  So if you wanted a land factory on repeat but not your air, then you're out of luck.  They allow you to single click a unit to disable repeat, but again, extra clicks and bad UI design. The units are kind of boring are don't seem balanced.  The 15 total missions are nothing special.  Total game time is around 10 hours to beat campaign.  The goo faction is not fun to play as you always have divide something to get units.  There is no repeat thus requires too much micro management.Again, the cut scenes are 10/10 awesome... the ending was a joke and huge disappointment after all the previous work.  But if you just want good CGI, watch a movie. :)			"

												I regret buying this game.There are three races, with very different building systemsHowever the units built by them are all the same, so gameplay is largely the same.I mean exactly the same, a light unit, an anti armour unit, a tank, an artililary, an anti air and a couple of aircraft.Combat is dull, there are no melee units, no fast units. Air get destroyed by anti air, to the point where they are unusable.The game is slow, units take forever to build and forever to move. Feels like you wait alot.There is little micro, the simplicity of the units seems to be designed to remove the micro from the game.Building is clunky (appart from the goo), for some reason things keep needing to be attached to other things.For example, humans have one core base, then every other builing needs to be connected by a pipe to the main base building. The pipe is weak and fustrating to place and should there ever be a gap in the pipe everything downstream stop s working. (you can't place buildings out of LOS).(Note humans can't build a second main base, so good luck building over to the next resource patch, ""enjoy"" that frustration)This is nothing like starcraft, i would say it is closer to total ana. Just slower, with no depth and no fun. "

												Decided to play this since it was free for 2 days... was sorely dissapointed.Since the majority of players that play multiplayer at any time are the ones who know what they were doing i was crushed instantly, but that i can understand. The 1st issue is the issue of AI. The Enemy AI is god awful sending forth 1 or 2 units seperatley in a sort of conga line towards your wall of turrets. that is untill the devs decide the best way to make it challenging is give the enemy 400 of the cheapest unit and send them at you straight away while you are still trying to place down your first god damn building. The Allied AI is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and at the very last level i found myself without an HQ swarmed by 300 units while my AI ally was sitting in a corner with an army to rival the total manpower of the third reich in 1940 while sending little 5 man scout parties and hurling them into the nearest blob of goo. Game concepts and multiplayer is average but the AI needs improvement.

												This game looks great, plays ok, and is generally bad. While the cutscenes and graphics are stellar looking, the general writing of the story and dialogue makes you want to cringe on every line. The gameplay gets very dull very fast, with some campaign games taking upwards of 40 mins to complete with no real variety or fun in them. Also, some of the campaign missions themselves are incredibly difficult while others are a cakewalk, so that can get annoying. Overall, its good to see a new RTS game hit the market, but they could have done a lot better in many categories.			"

												I played this on a free trial, and finished a couple of the campaigns. Though the game seemed fresh and new at first, as I played through the three races I saw the striking similarities in units. What really made me sad was that the units seemed to take a rather long time to construct, died easily (even the epic units) and there was little that made them unique. its a very beautiful game and the cut seems and voice acting as well as the AI is all well done. The Goo race plays very differently from the other two, but it is a little over powered. This game is not bad, it’s just hard to justify buying this when there are so many other good RTS’s out there.  "

												I've been playing this game for a few weeks.  Initially I was hesitant but I came to enjoy some of the unique aspects of the factions.  Once you play it for a while; however, you realize that the GOO faction seems really overpowering compared to the other Human and Beta races.  I play Beta a lot and to me, it's hard to overcome good GOO faction players.  The ability of the goo to adapt rapidly on the fly, with no time/resource penalty is kind of unbalanced.  Additionally, they have a few units that can climb on top of hills and pummel you.  To counter that, you have to start building one of two counter units, which takes time and resources that can't compete.  To me, the longer I play, the less fun it becomes.  I think the name says it all, Grey Goo.  The Goo faction is what the game is about.  So the hefty price of a premium game, where 1/3rd of the content is Goo and a preferred faction, is not worth the money.			"

												Man, finally beat the canpain, get it can PAIN, what a chore...Pretty generic rts, nothing new added to the genere, the factions aren't anything unique, and the units are all kind of sameish, there are epics, but like everything else in this game they take forever to build and then take even longer to get any where on a map, and i think that's my main gripe with this game, it is very slow paced for an rts.  Also the brush mechanic is super dumb.And then there is the story, the meta plot is ok, but the rising actions don't make any scene, mainly why did the humans just start killing betas?  I mean the humans literately started pouring through the keyhole seconds after the beta's opened it with guns blazzing.  Any rational person would have asked ""why are we attacking these aliens we just meet"", and then there is that one cut scene where one guy says ""hey it looks like the beta's can communicate"", but then the stupid ship computer is like ""probability of diplomacy 0%""  and then the other human is like well the ship must never be wrong lets kill the mother f...Also the voice acting/motion capture/facial animations for the character lucy just rubbed me the wrong way, could you be any more of an boring ""protagonist"" (that commits genocide against newly discovered aliens)...

												Post-release, the developers completely changed the scope and nature of the game, turning it into an expensive Starcraft clone, after it was advertised to fans as a faithful Westwood-type RTS, with the name of that now defunct studio routinely bandied about. The game released without either observer or replay mode, an incomplete campaign, and just a handful of multiplayer maps; all we were given was developer promises to deliver on these inadequacies. Now, that promised content is only available via DLC. If it at least had a healthy population, there might be a reason to tell you to get it, but everything about this game says “stay away.” If you already own Starcraft, you've already experienced the gameplay, anyway.

No hero units. no special abilities or powers. just who can pump out the most units the fastest and win. you do have free roam of where to place some of your buildings but there is only one resource type to go after. multiplayer missions last around 10 minutes. again build an appropriate order and rush your opponent and hope they have been sleeping.there is no real strategy for the maps and they are rather dull. however there is line of sight, elevation, stealth, but this has been around for sometime, nothing new.

												Really Reminds me of the Glory days of C&C when it started. That is a good thing but also a bad thing as I feel they took it back to far. It feels like i'm playing a game that came before C&C Red Alert. It has the base core down but is missing alot of the small parts that made RA fun to play. Making the entire scheme flow as easy as C&C is a great move but when you don't add different kinds of defenses and make it so that you are restriced in base placement really hampers the overall game play. There isn't a race I feel I can hunker down in and weather an onslaught and half the time all your buildings are kinda just where they can fit and rarely where you want them. Seems like there is one way to play it.....pump out units without a real care to your base. This ruins the game for me. It isalways fun to conquer but it is also fun to have an enemy attack and be repeled through sheer building and defense tactics.			"

												For the amount of time I got to play it was an okay experience the campaign was cool the muliplayer was idk I only got to play like 2 losing matches and one game where I spammmed one unit to win it was yea something haha my overall on if you should get this sure its got decent units decent campaign the multiplayer is ify but besides that its a pretty good title might be bias considering I love rts but you know I've played worse than this if it can be considered all that bad to startUseless ally ai and grey goo ai they can't seem to figure out they need to pump units by making more mother goo and the battles usually play out in favour of beta and human from what I've gathered I would like to say its a one sided battle if you got no clue what you're doing when you play the goo but easy win for beta mass one unit and crush everything basically the shroud is pretty useless if you don't want o get rekt in the first few minutes try to rush a double extract and pump those suckers out or you are gonna struggle for the hoomans I recomend heavy turtle with some massed units to go and crush and the final thing would I recommend this game? No not really but imma thumbs up for the effort in the campaign loved that.			"

												While indeed impressive in many aspects, from my simple play time I have already uncovered most of the core gameplay already.  It is overly complex for being far too shallow.  It's a real shame as they obviously put a lot of effort into the visuals.  But, the core design of this game does it no favors.  There is very little unit variety for starters.  Upgrades are few and simple, locking you into one per four categories in a rather lame attempt to have divergence.  The variety and depth just isn't there.  The AI is incompetent; my ally outright got slaughtered because while their base was being destroyed, their army sat on the other side of it playing poker or something.  The performance begins to suffer pretty quickly, and I've got an i7 pakcing a GTX970M.  Being forced to build connections to do anything is a pain.  The game is obviously geared toward offense, with defense being the lame duck option.  After three matches, it feels like I've seen everything in the game.  Oh, and all the units look same-ish, making them kind of boring. They took far too much inspiration (copying) from standard RTS formulas to create a visually attractive, shallow game that simply cannot demand much of my time.  I bought this on sale and I still feel rather upset with my purchase... just, the designers needed to really leverage their brains to make something that matched the love and devotion the visuals got.  And yet... the designers took one too many coffee breaks instead of doing their job.Overall, not recommended.  There are just too many alternative RTS options that offer an amazing experience.  Unlike this  one.			"

												I was really anticipating to play this game. And it's actually a pretty solid game, similar to classic RTS that I used to love. The fundamental issue here, is balance. Yes, all 3 factions play in a unique way, and that's a really positive thing. But there's huge defense and offense flaws in the factions. And without a properly balanced♥♥♥♥♥for-tat dynamic (found in most RTS games), what you end up with are easy wins or instalose depending on who you picked.The key is to have weaknesses to overcome, and strengths to apply. that puts the S in RTSAlso, what this classic RTS game is missing, is the ability to hunker down in one area and really build a solid base up. Being able to withstand a huge onslaught, because you built a solid base, was extremely satisfying..... you won't find that here. Especially if you play as the goo.This isn't a bad game. The issues aren't so terrible that I even feel negativity towards this game. and the issues present are nothing that a few balance patches can't fix! right now, I don't feel it's worth the price tag. A lack of fair & strategic play in a RTS means there actually is no game to play. There's not enough substance here... yet.On a more critical and less subjective note, none of the races are terribly interesting. It's hard for me to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about them, and they all look so cookie-cutter. They had an opportunity to bring some fresh aesthetics and design here (they clearly had the resources to do it, judging by the cutscenes). But what we have is nothing we haven't seen before. What's the point building a universve from the ground up, if you're going to make it bland? Yes, even if ""grey"" is in the title.positives:-excellent streamlined controls, especially for players who never use hotkeys in RTS-really nice, visually-very high quality cutscenesIf they fix this game, I'll absolutely try again and hopefully my opinion will change. Right now..... there's not enough here. Maybe pick it up if it's on sale if you REALLY love the RTS genre.			"

												I bought this game because it was recommended by a lot of people on launch. They said it was a slower SC2, similar to Command&Conquer and overall a great game.I agree with the slower part. This game has to be one of the slowest RTS in years. But that's not a good thing. I often find myself just waiting for my units to arrive. This can also be annoying while you ""base trade"" - if your units are in the middle of the map or even completely out of reach you will not get them back in time to defend your base. The best way to play this game is just defend your base until you have a huge amount of units and then kill everything that's in your way. Boring.Aside from that it misses a certain ""something"". AgeOfEmpires, Starcraft, Command&Conquer - all of these games have a different style, interesting units, interesting races. GreyGoo however has 3 boring factions, a handful of boring units and (that's the worst part) a low player base.Buy this game when it is on sale for ~10€. But don't waste 40€ like I did.			"

												Hype is over. Multiplayer is pretty much dead. There was one game which was hosted a 2on2 and I left after 30 minutes because we couldnt find a 4th guy. The search needs long for 1on1 too. The graphic looks behind for its time in which it was created, BFME looks better as a 2006 game... Game is to simple - every race is just unique with building but their units are to similar to get a tactic taste. The campaign is to sterotype like, to short and to be honest I don't really care for the characters because 5 missions is just not enough to get a feeling for them - on the other hand there is not much communication or sideevents in the campaign, so don't await to much. TLDR: Don't buy this game because it is not played often. Campaign is not really bad but bad, if you know what i mean... I have played multiplayer about 30 games and it gets boring because the tactics are very limited, allthough had fun at start but not it is just repeating everygame feels the same. A hope to revive realtime-strategy genre has died.			"

												I'm a big fan of Command & Conquer, and this looked to be a great spiritual successor. I loved the C&C campaings and with Grey Goo, everything seemed in order.However, after playing it for sometime, I realized it is not. The single player campaign just drops you in the story with some aliens and many terms (that are not explained), with hardly any backstory. In the second mission, it already gives you access to most structures and units, which I had no idea how they work. Lots of text tutorials. This seems a bit sloppy to me and makes it too convoluted. C&C slowly rolled out the units in missions specifically designed to teach you how to use them. And in normal difficulty, the enemy just steam rolls over my units, so I have to build and build units quickly. No time to think.I don't recommend it, unfortunately.			"

The story of this game is never properly explained, you are just thrust into the middle of it with hopes you will understand it.

												The worst AI I have never experienced.Graphic is really cool. design, and concepts are amazing. but there are terrible points you must not buy this. 1. AI. even u r attacked, units are doing nothing. AI level is terrible. when u attack area, unit doesnt have any priorty to attack. so when ur other unit is attacked, it just attack buildings, walls, etc. when even they r nothing to attack, they dont react when ur other unit is destroyed.  Moving AI is also terrible too.2. Story . it looked very cool at first time. but it was 90% same with starcraft  plot. I lost words. 3. Contents . whole unit count of each race is less than ur finger. and whole missions are only 15. each race has 5 missions. can not believe it. and DLC story must be included at first time. that was not special. Totally, It was the worst RTS game I have played. (I dont wanna tell C&C4 is RTS game)			"

												Got this at 50% off which should be the original price, the campaign is short, the game mechanics are clunky as if they this game came out 20 years ago, the game is also really really slowwwww, and considering there are 0 special abilities to use thats just stupid so you basically just A-Click your stuff and watch, you'll spend 10 minutes every game just getting resources to get a decent production going, the units are completely uninspired and there are very few of them, and the ultimate units are way too powerful, and the campaign is insanely short, like 4 missions per faction which goes in a chain starting with the Beta (humanoid aliens), then the humans, then the Goo.  The Goo are also the worst RTS faction i have ever played, they're supposed to be mobile and massing, except imagine having all of your production facilities spread all over the map with no way to rally troops forcing you to click each individual mother goo (production unit) to spawn a small or large blob which then can be transformed into your units, small blob for basic, big blob for more advanced units, and they have 0 aircraft units and every unit is slow as balls.Beta and Humans are pretty basic designs, Beta have outposts that range from small to large and buildings have to be placed next to them to gain power and function with their main defense being emplacing troops on walls, humans build powerlines allowing them to extend their infrastructure to their boundries to build turrets, units are your standard stuff infantry then up to tanks then aircraft and your Ultimate units, both play roughly the same.The only thing that really stands out in this game are the cutscenes, where they clearly spent the vast majority of their funds, each mission before and after has a cutscene which are top notch, sadly the story on the whole is kinda bad or rather its not horrible but its left terribly incomplete and considering they're releasing DLC, which i'm not paying for 3 missions i can only imagine they'll want to milk people for more money to get the rest, not sure why anyone in their right mind would do that though.TLDR- The game is slow and clunky, the Goo is the worst faction i've played, the Campaign is insanely short 7.8 hours for me to finish, the Units are uninspired, and the only good thing about it is the cutscenes and story which is left completely unfinished.  Should be a 20 dollar title.			"

												I would describe this game as a simplified Starcraft - less unit micromanagement, only one resource, simplified technology tree - with some elements from C&C series. It has decent graphics good optimisation and is generally quite fun to play. I can't speak about multiplayer cause I am not into RTS online experience but I found campaign to be quite pleasing. It took me around 20 hours to complete the story with bonus content on normal mode I find this to be ok. The biggest highlight for me is that all available races are completely different in terms of development philosophy, this is a little bit contrasted by the fact that essentially all the units are mirrored between them, but it is still something I found to be cool.I would not recommend this game to hardcore StarCreaft-er, or people who love to micromanage. Other than that it's a nice entry into RTS genre.			"

												Glad I bought this when it was 50% off regular price. Disappointing. Was looking forward to a 21st century take on classic RTS games. Very small unit choice. Some flexibility with unit roles when techs are researched, but just not enough. Single player campaign is good but skirmish mode is not worth bothering with. The AI has you at a disadvantage econimcally even when you play against Easy:Defensive. They will base-rush with overwhelming force before you've had a chance to put in place decent defenses, so unless you base-rush first and wipe them out early you're going to lose. What is the point of playing if the game isn't going to last more than 15 minutes, if it forces you to take them out so early in the game?Just not taactical enough for me.			"

												Grey Goo is an interesting game, I actually thought it was a 4x space game and bought it thinking that I will have some galactic fun (yes I confused it with endless series) when I started playing the game though, I got my old flashbacks the thoughts of warcraft, starcraft, CnC and Dune rushed back, and I finished the game quite quickly and felt humans to be veery slow and goo to be enjoyable.So after rambling this much, is it a good game? as some one lastly played red alert 3(which I did not enjoyed - well, enjoyed it a little maybe) as a rts, yes it is. but it is an abandoned game,  it is an underrated game, it is a game that has so many flaws that you will want to pull your hair out, but you might want to play again and again in the end if you find this game in sale buy it, it's a good game to play and a good game to spend time.

												My review handles the single player only - I'm not much of a MP RTS player. I completed the main campaign and also the DLC. I really liked the game and hate seeing so mixed review score the game has on Steam. Although the game is referred as an oldschool RTS, it has also got a lot of its own ideas through the race differences and units, how they control, build and function.The overall setting and story are compelling. Visual style is great. The races are varied and interesting. I had my doubts about the Goo but it ended up being my favourite faction. The single stand-out element of the game IMO is the sound and music. Very cool music throughout and superb sound effects. The voice-acting is also very professionally made and a pleasure to listen.If you like RTS and playing single player campaigns I highly recommend to try out Grey Goo.			"

												I didn't put much time into the game but here are my current thoughts. I have been playing Rise of Legends since it came out in 2006 and now I'm looking for a game to scratch the itch but I never found an RTS that I liked as much. Grey Goo seems like it's going in the right direction but not far enough. It's like a very good template but not enough content. The new faction was a great step in the right direction. What I think this game needs is more variety inside each faction. The unit and building variety is way too low. In Rise of Legends, a game from 2006 just 1 faction has more variety then all factions combined in this game. I recommend the devs maybe check the game out becouse it's the same god damn case like this game. Just flew under the radar. Except Rise of Legends is a much greater game. Maybe the devs can draw inspiration from it. It seem they still care about it and it could make a comeback. I still recommend the game to RTS players. Also I think the game lacks a bit of personality. The music, unit design and overall look of the factions are good/ok. While Rise of Legends has the most amazing soundtrack, map design, unit design and overall faction design I have ever seen. Also the soundtrack in that game plays in context of what's happening. I know I'm comparing the games alot but that's becouse they seem a bit similar to me and they are both underappreciated. I hope the devs see this review and atleast think about it.			"

												Grey Goo is an interesting game, I actually thought it was a 4x space game and bought it thinking that I will have some galactic fun (yes I confused it with endless series) when I started playing the game though, I got my old flashbacks the thoughts of warcraft, starcraft, CnC and Dune rushed back, and I finished the game quite quickly and felt humans to be veery slow and goo to be enjoyable.So after rambling this much, is it a good game? as some one lastly played red alert 3(which I did not enjoyed - well, enjoyed it a little maybe) as a rts, yes it is. but it is an abandoned game,  it is an underrated game, it is a game that has so many flaws that you will want to pull your hair out, but you might want to play again and again in the end if you find this game in sale buy it, it's a good game to play and a good game to spend time.

												My review handles the single player only - I'm not much of a MP RTS player. I completed the main campaign and also the DLC. I really liked the game and hate seeing so mixed review score the game has on Steam. Although the game is referred as an oldschool RTS, it has also got a lot of its own ideas through the race differences and units, how they control, build and function.The overall setting and story are compelling. Visual style is great. The races are varied and interesting. I had my doubts about the Goo but it ended up being my favourite faction. The single stand-out element of the game IMO is the sound and music. Very cool music throughout and superb sound effects. The voice-acting is also very professionally made and a pleasure to listen.If you like RTS and playing single player campaigns I highly recommend to try out Grey Goo.			"

It's made by the same guys who created the RTS genre way back in the 90's with Dune 2, and Command and Conquer (before EA ruined the franchise.)I really want to elaborate on this review - and I will... but for the time being, I'm having way too much fun playing the game to take the time to write a proper review!great controlsbeatiful cut scenes3 very unique races "

Still, i came into this game expecting a competitive, balanced multiplayer experience.It didnt deliver.Though the devs keep working on it very slowly, i can only say that if you want a better balanced multiplayer RTS there are others out there.Like SC2.

												After being super hyped for End of Nations, and then it getting cancelled, it's so nice to finally have another game from these guys. I couldn't have asked for more. Being a long time RTS fan, I felt right at home the moment I started playing this. And yet, it still manages to be unique. Base building for each of the three factions feels completely different to any RTS I've played in the past, and they're different to each other as well. An excellent example of staying traditional while moving forward. Highly recommended for any traditional RTS fan.			"

												Lets start ofI love RTS games with base building in general. Grey Goo doesn't have the base building of Command and Conquer 3 or Generals but it still allows a base with walls and refineries and unit depots. Only bad thing is the base building isn't as free your lock to a HQ and smaller outposts that can be deployed. Game looks great graphically and plays really well, nice mechanics such as hiding and ambush and attaching certain upgrade buildings to get other units. Research isn't that good, limited to one per each time(land,air,stealth,arty) I would prefer a research tree and a grid lock free base building. Overhaul 8/10, would recommend it if you like RTS with a sense of base building. I can bare with the base building and research but the unit cap isn't good (200 around) but fits the way the game works, each unit takes a certain amount of space.  "

If your like me and just like large scale RTS games in general, then I personally recomend you avoid this one, however if your not a big fan of RTS games or hate micromanagement then you could easily find this to be a worthwhile perchace.Quick rundown of what makes this diferent (for better or worse).Simple. Not many units, not many buildings, not much veriation on anything really.No early game. Like really, you can skip the first 10 mins of the game and half the time you can come back and still be good to go.Small scale, even relaxing. If you desire big battles, play SupCom:FA, if you want something to waste half an hour on every once and a while, buy this.			"

												Grey Goo is by no means a bad or a terrible game. It's core concepts, from everything to it's delicate unit models, to it's gorgeous cutscenes, and it's amazing soundtrack make it a 'good' game. The unit models are unique and creative, every aesthetic of Grey Goo from it's units to it's structures and walls, make me want to play this game. However, the only thing that is great about this game is it's aesthetic and soundtrack. Grey Goo has beautiful music, and a fantastic Sci-Fi setting, with cutscenes that allow us to get into it's wonderful world. But the aesthetic is all this game is, and it's gameplay gets old very fast. Everything that involves gameplay is somewhat lacking, greatly.Performance has improved since then, but the abundant players that once played are now nearly gone. The Singleplayer is one hell of a ride, the Beta missions were done absolutely perfectly although it had a few flaws. The Human and Goo missions soured the singleplayer for me, as I was treated with an escort mission and stealth missions. While stealth missions aren't too bad, the reason why it's so bad is because of the lack of unit variety. I wouldn't complain if we had some stealth units, but we don't, and we're forced to watch the A.I. do some patrol paths for several minutes.  It's also incredibly frustrating because the devs have ripped the 'micro potential' in this game. A RTS game, where army control 'should' be crucial, but having very VERY limited units in a stealth mission in a game where micro potential is thrown out the window? Yeah, that doesn't mesh well. The human escort mission wouldn't be too bad if the Goo weren't able to traverse and hide everywhere, or if their anti-air units weren't so powerful. That being said, the Beta Missions are the only great part of the campaign.The hotkey system is absolutely terrible for an RTS. While critics like Total Biscuit claimed that it was innovative, hotkeys begin to feel less like shortcuts and more like a mess. I don't play Dota2, or League of Legends, I don't play Mobas, I play RTS games, so of course I'm going to end up fighting against this game's hotkey system. It's a bit hard to get used to the first time, and I didn't care to learn it. It would have been 'innovative' if these hotkeys were customizable, right? But they aren't, you're forced to learn this terrible hotkey system, and if you play RTS games, that is something you can't get used to. I would love it if it were a customizable hotkey system, so that I could use my 'own' shortcuts.The unit variety is incredibly lacking and the only difference between units is their stats, really. They all play the same and it gets boring, fast. The only time units have variety and identity is in the early game with the commando/sentinel/drover units. The three unit concepts are great, and they all feel different and act differently, but when you realize that t1 is easily outclassed by t2 tank spam and/or artillery, you stop seeing this kind of variety. Every t2-t3 unit acts almost exactly the same! The three races don't have their own unique equivalents to tanks or artillery, and most of the time they just play the same. All tanks and siege units pretty much fight the same way, they are all slow, can't traverse terrain, etc. We don't get speedy, fast ground units, like in sc2 or CnC, that could deal damage and harass effectively. We don't have stealthed units or sabeoteur types, infantry is nearly nonexistent, and there are no activated unit abilities. Every unit in the game has this very slow turn radius, and act at very VERY slow speeds. Because of this, you're more inclined to clump armies, rather than to spread them out if you're under attack from artillery/air, or you need a surround. Also, there are no support units with special abilities, like the ability to repair or heal friendly units. There are no abilities that can turn the tides of a match or make anything interesting. All units will also focus-fire targets instead of picking their own, which makes micro frustrating. Units that are told to attack move somehow gain 10x the mass they had before, and push each other into enemy fire, instead of attacking the closest unit. Not only that units will always target the one with the lowest health, and will follow that unit until it finishes the job or it's dead. So if you just attack move, and the guy moves that low hp unit out of the way, YOUR ENTIRE ARMY WILL CHASE IT.The units being able to hide in forests/trees/shrubs is the only thing that's innovative about this game. Most of it's concepts are 'dumbed' down from the RTS genres. Rushing has been pretty much nerfed, there are no support units, casters, healing units, or even stealthed units. It's upgrade system is incredibly lacking in terms of an RTS, they give 'passive' abilities, which barely makes up for the game's lack in unit variety. What's even worse is that each upgrade takes almost forever to get out, I believe one upgrade was 2minutes long. This makes timing pushes kind of pointless, and the builds in this game really boil down to who gets the most refineries up first.For $50 this game is seriously not worth the price. There is so much lacking in unit variety, that it's laughable. Units are what you get to sell players your game, and we all get 10 units that play and act the same. There's no support units, casters, or stealth units, the Singleplayer is about 15 missions, unit upgrades are lackluster and just lazy. The hotkey system is something that RTS gamers will have extensive trouble learning, and even with Epic Units (the game's selling point) they are completely boring compared to CnC Kane's Wrath's Marv, Hexapod, and Redeemer. Many players have stayed away simply because of this game's high price tag, and you know what? Stay away. I feel like I was ripped off.			"

												This game definitely has potentional, it has a good story, decent factions with a great variety of gamplay between them.I think there's a quite a bit of work still before this becomes a ""good game"".Grey Goo is hands down the easiest to expand and pressure with.  They're easy to play, highly adaptive and flexible to any challenges.  SUre they are balanced by being weaker and what not.The humands, are stuck to bloody ""telephone lines"", embedded into the ground, and just for fun, they can't pass over passable land where you cannot build, such as under tree cover or on ramps.You more often then not find yourself not albe to expand in any direction and choke out on resources as the other two factions, almost effortless, spread out to all the richesBeta, the easiest faction by far to play, is a rapid xpanding, mobile defense only faction with underwhelming units and an emphatic dependence on walls.I'd like to see Grey Goo a bit more imobile, particularly the bigger ones, and should be much slower to move around.Humans should be able to guild on any passable terrain, that's just redonk.  and the powerlines need to not be stuck to the same angle; It's like laying dominos to get around corners, and just hope your base isnt surround by cover (can't expand through them)and Betas are probably the most balance of them all.

												I found it boring. Units died really fast so the combat wasn't too spectacular to watch, forests were untouchable deathtraps and the Goo faction felt overpowered and simple. All the game ending 'super' units were basically just large artillery units. It did feel really polished and the designs of the units and factions were cool. Unfortunately I didn't think there were enough units, there basically just seemed to be one for every essential role (Anti-infantry, anti-armor, anti-air, artillery and air). The Beta characters in the campaign were really well designed and had personality. I honestly really wanted to  like it but the gameplay just seems very basic to me. Maybe its just not my kind of game but I recommend that if you decide to buy it, remember to give it a thorough once over before your refund timer runs out.			"

												(Alpha review) Multiplayer is just about dead, there's very few people online (under 100 people a day online according to steam) and if you happen to connect to one you will experience severe stuttering and lag issues making it unplayable until the point you disconnect. Additionally both singleplayer and multiplayer have stuttering (units freezing/catchup) when my systems fps is over 60 and cpu isn't hitting max (perhaps a code issue).It's an alpha game while the gameplay is fun it's overally not worth $50 at this point; the multiplayer is unplayable I personally would only spend $15-20.

The UI feels weak, the information is bland, the units do not look interesting even being unique. It is very hard to trully feel what each units does and what you composition will result in, to the point that the only thing that matters is to deathball your oponent.Air combat and artillary are lackluster, the animations are so bland they don´t make you feel you are having an epic combat at all.

												The campaign for this game is really well done. The hotkey system is nice. The biggest fault of this game is the poor matchmaking due to a small population.I love playing multiplayer when I get an even matchup, but most of the time that is not the case. Constantly getting matched with top 25 players when I am around 200 level is very frustrating. This alone will turn away a lot of new players, further hurting the population. I wish there was a way to restrict matches to within 50 places on the ladder. I bought the game over the weekend when it was 60% off, which I do recommend, but don't pay full price unless you are exceptionally good at RTS games.			"

												This is an extremely well polished game that is definately remeniscent of the old Command and Conquer series. Read the other reviews if you would like to see how great this game is. That said however, this game is great, but I never play it. Why is that you ask? well after doing skirmishes for all the races, they all had one thing in common. They were boring as hell. No special abilites, no alternate attacks, they just shoot stuff and they die slowly. There is absolutely nothing to bring you into (or back) to this world.Now that wasn't the only reason for my lack of renewed interest in this game, the second (and most fatal) reason is that (at least on the west coast of the united states) there are maybe one or two online matches total. And 50% of the time both of them are locked. The AI (like most C&C games) are very predictable and not very much fun. Maybe this lack of community problem will change, but for now, I wish I did not sink $50 into this game no one else plays			"

YouTube™ Video: Should You Buy Grey Goo?  A 3 Minute RTS Review 

			Views: 353		

			Grey Goo was released in late January and many expected it to be the second coming of Command and Conquer. Instead what they got was a pile of goo, grey goo.		

On day one release I went into multiplayer and to my surprise, no one was playing multiplayer, at all.  I went to the forums to find out the game is Region Locked and the only region that has a real population is the California, Chicago, New York City, and London.  So I could choose to trade my speedy download speed on Steam to temporarily be able to play multiplayer.  It's one of those bone head launches.  Why would anyone think launching a region locked multiplayer game was a great idea?So after changing my region to the US I found that if I waited for 25-30 minutes I could find a game.  Not optimal, but it's there.  Unfortunately it seems that the population has basically abandoned the game already and finding a game and you'll spend more time finding a game than you will playing the game since everyone uses some form of range cheese to win.  All the units of the game are hard counters to some other unit so if you guess wrong as to what unit to build, you lose.  The scouting unit of the game is air tech meaning if you unlock the ability to scout, you will lose to an artillery rush.So if you're buying the game, it will just be for the campaign.  Some people will say the campaign takes 15 hours.  That's hobblegosh.  If you are STRUGGLING on the campaign it will take 15 hours.  But a solid hard difficulty plathrough of the game will take no more than 9 hours total.  It is a 15-mission campaign.There are three factions.  The Alpha are sort of like the Protoss (except the alpha are humans).  The Beta are kind of like the Terrans (except they're aliens).  And then you have the Goo which are a unique faction that will multiply in a rather unusual manner.  Add in a bit of C&C charm and you have a solid RTS game.The game has a lot of really minor problems that are easy enough to fix, but shouldn't have been there are launch.  Pathfinding is really weird.  If you click a flying unit to a location it won't go the fastest path.  Instead it'll just to loop around the map to that location.  No unit chooses the shortest path.  It's all very weird.  AA and artillery units will always run ahead of your army.  This can be compared to something like Starcraft 2 where speed primarily decides what is in front.  But the ""move at lowest speed setting"" always does a weird shuffle on the units.Also get used to hearing about your buildings be under attack... over and over and over and over.  Every single time anything hits one of your buildings instead of pinging the damage on the map (like every other RTS) it will tell you in a clear voice what's being attacked.  So if you are being attacked at five sites on different targets then you'll get overlapping voice messages that will drive you insane.  Certain campaign missions are especially terrible for this as it is a constant stream of Goo forces attacking you.But it's a solid RTS game with no population.  The campaign is a short experience in which the story telling elements are exceptionally short.  On top of that some of the maps are poorly optimized.  Maps featuring high numbers of units will feature gameplay lag that will not be fixed from lowering your settings.It's rather unfortunate that this game had such a poor launch otherwise it could have become the next Company of Heroes or Men of War.  But, like most scifi RTS games, the population fizzled out very quickly.			"

Seriously?- Most mechanics are very basic and underdeveloped- differences between factions are much smaller than in Earth, especially when it comes to unitsI would recommend it for more casual players who are looking for easy to learn, fast-paced RTS gameplay, but for everyone else...

												Well, this game seemed pretty good.  Then I played it for a while.  The balance of the game is awful.  As soon as I started building walls, the enemy AI had units that outranged all of my guys.  So if my walls don't do anything, what's the point of having them?  Also the micro and and the interface are clunky.  So it was frustrating trying to do things with the game.  Not nearly as intuitive as CnC or Starcraft.  Constant harrassment from the AI in every larger groups without any change to do anything or explore makes the same a constant pain to play.Kind of want a refund.			"

												Spent a very limited time with the game, but that's just because the combat was so lackluster. All units are tediously slow and the sound effects bland. I couldn't bring myself to play further than the second mission.The cutscenes were excellent (bar some of the voice acting), and there seems to be a decent plot behind it all, so initially the singleplayer was very promising. I enjoyed the modular base-building as well once I got used to it. However, when the combat proper started in the second mission I got bored very quickly. I was counting on the later units introducing more variety to the combat, but it all looks very basic and all the weaponry sounds the same. All the drama and action brought in by the cutscenes just evaporates (much like my war parties at the enemy base's gates).Thanks for the free weekend, but no thanks.			"

												RTS and civ building games are my favorite type of games, so I was rather excited to try a new RTS game. My friend and I have been playing Command & Conquer together for nearly ten years, and we've been looking for a new RTS to try, so I thought I'd give Grey Goo a chance.The Ffactions are unique enough from one another, they build completely different, distinct looks, etc. and the game is quite beautiful graphically. Sadly that's the only good thing I have to say, since the game seems to push you to be a fast and aggressive player which I generally tend to play as a turtle. There's basically no base expansion aside from resource gathering and finding a big enough space so you can build your war factory and attached all the neccesary bits to it so you can produce everything. Resources are slow and limited, which adds to not being able to expand much. To me it seems this game was designed around the idea of quick, simple RTS games with others in online multiplayer, and to that effect a lot of the driving content, such as diverse units, structures and the ability to not only push your army forward but your base forward as well, is not present.You got the butter without the bread.

												War might be evolving (as the game's tagline says), but some game developers are clearly not.It's 2015 and the game doesn't let you click on the the terrain and drag to pan the view (you have to move the cursor to the edges of the screen). Also, can't tilt the camera, can't pause the game while panning the view or trying to select individual units, etc.. Overall, the UI seems designed by people who haven't played any game or used any 3D application or mapping software made in this century.Buy only if you enjoy fighting against the UI instead of fighting the enemy units.Also, it has the worst performance (lowest frame rate / highest GPU utilization) of any RTS I've ever played. The graphics don't look bad, and the game is still playable (well, if you can put up with the prehistoric UI), but plenty of other games look better and have better performance.			"

												Disclaimer: I didn't like it. The races are dull in my opinion, with Beta being outright annoying, the story has many plot holes, with questionable logic moving the main characters. Biggest idiocy: The humans attack the Beta because they try to make contact? While conducting an exploratory mission? The humans take the rogue nano on their main ship, and it just destroys it? Who commands this mission? Captain Dumb and Three Stoges?Units are very meh. Almost nothing that makes you feel powerful. Everything feels pretty... noncosequential, even explosions are mediocre and without spice. Ok - one unit is awesome. The Hand of Rukh. The rest are variations of the same, really. The titular Goo is not as much interesting as I expected it to be.I'm sorry. I really dislike some aspects of this game. Especially the ugly, bucktoothed aliens who say ""wow is under attack"".			"

												Grey Goo seems okay, and it can be fun, but the campaign is awful and their storytelling is pretty bad*THINGS* are happening all the time and there are characters who look like they are doing something, but it gives me no idea who these people are and why I should even care. The pacing is constantly set on BALLS-TO-THE-WALLS mode and doesn't give you any breathing room at all. This is echoed by the campaign's level design as well with enemies constantly attacking you from every angle, every mission, and basically requires you to have quick reflexes non-stop. I've played through the first 5 missions and so far there have been very little variety --Each mission played just like the last.It's a shame because they clearly spent a lot of time on the fully rendered cutscenes between each mission but they add absolutely nothing to the game at all. Every one of them left me confused and thinking ""That's it? Why even bother?"". It's such a tremendous waste of time and effort.The last straw was the game crashing when I tried to save. I couldn't muster up the motivation to continue playing since.			"

												I'm currently in the process of trying to get a refund for this game, and here's a list of why.-THE MAIN MENU LAGS-The campaign lags (cutscenes too)-Skirmish lags-Online Lags at like 50/200 unit cap, and don't forget those fun random disconnections, if you can get a game that is.-EVERYTHING LAGS-The campaign, to me, is stupidly hard and unenjoyable.-The Skirmish AI, even on hard, might as well be a monkey randomly pressing keys. Seriously, the skirmish AI is just stupid.-There are maps in the RANKED 1v1 ladder that are blantantly broken, and to top it off, there are only about 8 to begin with.-Currently only 2v2 is avaliable.I just can't recommend this game in it's current state, especially for 50$. Wait for a patch or price drop. DO NOT buy this game right now, it's just not worth it.			"

												Although this game is very reminicent of C&C and I do find myself enjoying it about 4 hours into the game I have to say I would not reccomend it at this point.  The reason being:It Crashes Constantly!!!And to boot the crash report upload process can take anywhere from 5-20 minutes, at which point you're unable to re-load the game until it finishes uploading!Grey Goo if you're gonna release with so many crash issues you should have an auto-save option to at least soften the blow everytime the client crashes.  At least then I wouldn't have to replay the same mission over and over again from the start!  I'm only on the 3rd mission and I've probably gone through 5 or 6 game client crashes.  I have the latest video drivers, the latest window updates, and I'm not running a POS system...This game shows promise but I'd wait a month or two before buying it after the bugs have been worked out and the price comes down.

												I really really want to like this game....I just can't. I came from a very strong background of playing Age of Empires 2 and C&C Generals at a highly ranked level. I love the RTS Genre. This game.....it's just not that good. Had such high hopes for this game and Tryst, and both have disappointed me to the point of not wanting to try to play anymore RTS games. I have not sunk massive amounts of time into this game, however I should want to play a game that when I purchased it cost $50. I just can not. I have no strive to play this game. Nothing about it is unique or interesting. Honestly if I had to mostly compare it to a game, it would be Dune The Battle of Arrakis for Sega Genesis (which is a game that I loved as a kid). However this game really fails to improve on anything. There is nothing that sets it apart from every other RTS out there. I just simply can not support this game as much as I really really want to.			"

The sad thing is the game limits you to 200 units and you can only play up to 2 v 2.  So if you like to play the campaigns against a computer then this is for you but otherwise stay away.  Also the game will crash on a 2 v 2 game so I am not sure if it can really handle it.			"

												I don't usually reveiw games, but I felt obligated to to protect RTS fans from dropping $50 on the boring that is Grey Goo.  My problem with this game, in a nutshell. is the blandness.  For example, there aren't particularly few units; it's just that the units the game has all feel very generic and similar.  The beta all have walkers with guns.  The goo have spiders or blobs that fire blobs.  The humans have hover drones with guns (a couple lasers).  And the units feel very similar not jsut in appearance, but in gameplay.  It doesn't seem to make much of a difference whether I build a few tanks or mroe smaller units; they all move slowly and kill the enemy slowly.  Also, the AI is terrible.  On the hardest difficult, it's almost no challenge at all with even teams, and even with uneven teams it's not too difficult.  The campaign is bland and uninteresting, much like the units and the world.  The game has nice graphics, runs smoothly, and has polish.  But it has no character.  It's supposed to harken back to the golden age of RTS, but it's just so bland.  Command & Conquer (in its various incarnations) always had flaws, but it had plenty of character.  There were flamethrowers, machineguns, shotguns, lasers, cannons, artillery, missiles, superweapons, and unique factions.  Every unit felt cool, and varied greatly in appearance, function, speed, damage, damage type, armor, etc.  Every unit looked was unique.  Grey Goo is jsut a pile of similar units doing similar things, and if you have more units, you win.  There's only one resource that has basically no explanation or interest.  There's really no reason to come back and paly thsi game more than a few times, because every match feels exactly the same.  Not recommended.			"

Of course the progress was not saved (what are those 'save campaign' slots for ?).It's too bad this game is not stable, and it's worse that it's not even fault-tolerant, even the worst games from Origin are resilient about this.Even if the game plays smoothly, it doesn't cover the frustration of trading 30mn of progress upon a hard disk fill.

												Sorry to have to down rate this game due to fact that production of everything is so slow, if the game was more fast paced it would be more enjoyable in my opinion. Also that I find annoying is that to build defense turrets you have to build a combination of buildings together to produce them which makes it hard to properly defend your base in the beginning of given map. Other than that, the game looks really nice; alot of time went in to make it look good. I just wish they spent more time on the mechanics.			"

												Sorry to have to down rate this game due to fact that production of everything is so slow, if the game was more fast paced it would be more enjoyable in my opinion. Also that I find annoying is that to build defense turrets you have to build a combination of buildings together to produce them which makes it hard to properly defend your base in the beginning of given map. Other than that, the game looks really nice; alot of time went in to make it look good. I just wish they spent more time on the mechanics.			"

												Simply put it's just boring. The three races don't stand out from each other. I didn't play long, but long enough to see it was a waste of money, even though I got it on a big sale.The races are extremely boring, the units are boring. They didn't appear much different from each other, it feels like clones of the same unit, just with a different model and different firing rate. Sound effects are bad. Story put me to sleep. It was nice to see another RTS come out, but wow. Go back to something like Dawn of War or Command and Conquer			"

												I jsut dont get all the great positive reviews.  I love RTS games but this one.....wow even for the 20 bucks i paid for it i feel ripped off. I cant imagine what people that paid 50 bucks feel like.You ever buy a game play it like 1 time and your jsut like... ""Ehhh whatever""  and you never load it up agian beacause its just not fun?  well thats this game in a nutshell, its so bland, plain and un inspired. After a few good hours of play you will  learn all 3 races have pretty much the same units just with diff game art and bulding methods.  Do you want to try and build unit A faster than your opponent? Do you want do the same exact thing in eveyr match as far as build order?  Do you want an RTS where there is no Backdooring, no rushing, no tech rushing, no strategy of any kind other than who can click the factories and make orders faster than the other guy? then this game is for you.In short the game blows for the price even at 20 bucks just pass over this game and buy something else I beg you.The online community is dead all you can get is 1on1 matches there is no one for 2v2 matches and that is the max you can do.  What a waste of cash im gunna load this game onto a burnable CD jsut so i can♥♥♥♥♥♥on it.			"

												My lack of reccomendation exists on the premise that you already own StarCraft II. If you don't, please ignore that and consider picking up this title.I bought this game looking for a fun and visually-vibrant twist on StarCraft II, a game I've probably put over 100 hours into (a casual glance, I know). What I found instead was literally StarCraft II. Most everything is visually indistinguishable from a very slightly modded SCII UI, and that really dissappointed me. The voice overs, from the way communiqués appear in portraits to the voiceovers for the unit reactions, the resource harvesting system, it all just felt so boring to me after already having played SCII as much as I wanted; I didn't want to spend $50 to play it again.If you love the SCII gameplay and want more of the same with a less rich story that has a lot less history and depth to it but with some very nice CGI, grab this on a sale, otherwise, avoid.

The units in the game are of poor design, poor animations, and poor feeling to them.There are no physics in the game, and dead untis not even stay on the battlefield, they just dissapier in a puff.2. The devs charge you for obvious updates, they call it a DLC, when its obviously was part of the original design,and unless you buy it, your game experience will suffer			"

												I read that Grey Goo would bring back the emotion and feeling of older rts games. As i'm a big fan of C&C I waited till it was on sale and bought it. Firts off: For the graphics options I chose, the graphics I saw and the pc I own the FPS were far too low. But who cares, I thought...the game itself is quite fun, I think, somehow. However it takes decades to load a campaign mission and after the game tried to screw with me by telling me to ""click here to start"" and then not doing anything I decided this is going back to were it belongs. tl;dr: Nice game if you have 2 much moneyz, otherwise go play C&C			"

												Tell you what - I second-chanced it. Soon as I posted my review, and I mean within seconds, I got either two developer accounts or two fanboy accounts thumbs-downing it.First, let's take a look at Petroglyph games I've purchased in the past:SW: Empire at WarUAW: Earth AssaultAnd, I purchased most of the C&C series every time they came out with a new one, with the exception of Generals. I prefer non-symmetrical race/faction selection and long tactical battles to twitchy mass-and-slaughter games.When much of the early C&C series became available as a Steam download, I jumped on it - it was cheap and brought back some good memories of early pay-by-the-hour LAN houses.When I looked at the reviews for GG, I thought, ""Kind of a silly name for a game, but hey - it's got a lot that I like in it"". Got it on sale, downloaded, installed, played a bit of the campaign to get a feel, jumped into Skirmish. Beyond the crashing, over-bloated filesize (and unnecessary cinematics), here's what you can expect:VisualsGraphically speaking, it's reminicsent of the art styling used in RA/CC - that is, isometric terrains with very little detail on the small units. I wouldn't be surprised if the game was structured into ""doodads"" and ""statics"". While this helps performance, especially when dealing with large groups, it feels largely unoptimized. Lighting and shadows seem about 10 years old.But hey, it runs smoothly enough.GameplayNow, this is the point where I really didn't like the game. I liked the return to the traditional RTS, but everything was stripped of depth. Tech trees that result in 4 technologies that are pretty underpowered? How about two of the playable races being PRETTY MUCH THE SAME in terms of building, with one being able to spread out a little more using conduits, the other being little blob bases with satellite areas? 1 basic infantry, 1 light tank, 1 heavy tank, 1 artillery, 1 stealth, 1 scout air, 1 bomber, 1 general purpose air. Turrets and flak. Walls. That's the game in a nutshell. There's no real unit variety, no real differences between the units beyond their animations and textures. ZERO depth. Because of this, gameplay becomes the same as playing GDI in the RA series. Seriously, I played both of the non-goo races and wiped the Goo off the skirmish map using a handful of air units while turtling in a base with a couple turrets placed strategically.  The AI (on normal) has a REALLY bad habit of trying the same entry points with the same units over and over and over again, only changing the numbers it sends. Take out resource production and you're good to go. There's nothing new here.MultiplayerTo be honest, I didn't even try MP. I won't even give it a shot - this game is flat and dull.ConclusionSave your money and move on. If you want good old-school RTS, get the old games. You won't find much MP, but at least you won't get a shoddy copy of gameplay from ages gone past. Looking for strategy? Look elsewhere. Looking for pretty? Not here. Looking for depth? Don't make me laugh. The problems with this game go far beyond crashes and optimization. I appreciate Developer response, but it won't be necessary.			"

												This game is amazing! One of my favorite RTS game, the grey goo is very intresting while the Beta and Humans look boring they are both very fun to use. (I had no technical issues and I have my graphics on max but I use a semi beefy laptop, my theory is that people forgot to turn off antialiasing as it is on to start with)This list below is for the game in general.Pros:Very funGood multiplayerThe Goo can eat people.Two Goos can team upVery intresting story, the campaign has me hooked!The gameplay mechanics and upgrades are very in depth.The Goo isnt as simple as it looks which makes me very happy (all be it I suck at Grey Goo)Cons:The Goo doesnt look and act like snot...The hud is very big but I did manage to deal with it and you get used to it.GOO RUSH!!!!The pro/con list below is for the Beta race.Pros:In my opinion this is the starting race for newer players.I like the story line of the Beta BEST QOUTE EVER (if im not getting confused with my qoutes) ""Today we dont run from our enimies, they run from us.""Can put defenses anywhere.Cons: None really as they are the middle grounds when it comes to racesI reccomend starting with Beta.The pro/con list below is for Humans.Pros:'MURICAVery technolgically advancedVery cool troops Just cool in generalM.U.MCons:Not very offensiveThe pro/con list below is for Grey Goo.Pros:A twist to the gameWhat the game is based aroundOffensiveVery mobileAnd can ""adapt"" according to the websiteCons:No defensive formsTakes some time to get resourcesTo get alot of resources you have to spread all across the mapDLC:(Note I have not played the campaign yet and will simply be reviewing the race in general I will not be reviewing gameplay but I may edit my review later on)Pros: FREAKING AWESOME!The noises the troops make remind me alot of a Predator from the movie of the same name (I highly suggest you watch the movie)The troops remind me of Protoss from SC2The troops can take a some hits.Very unique buildings.Do alot of damage and can take alot.Cons:No wallsBuild timesThat concludes my very in depth review of Grey Goo I would buy this if you love the Real Time Strategy games genre.

												A truly excellent game, solid all around. The balance is excellent, constantly making you reconsider what the 'best' faction/tactic is, keeping the gameplay fluid and intense.The story is interesting and very cool, as are the very well made cutscenes.The entire game feels well polished and filled with effort, shown in the developers care in the story and campaign.Challenging in places but easy to learn over time, once you get the hang of the slow but important early game and expansion.Great fun and sadly underated.

""Forest"" mechanics that suppose to give you or your enemy an advantage goes to nothing since after one of the units enters it is over.-------So.... I suggest that if you are interested in this game's plot - just wait for another free weekend and enjoy.Not really worth the money if you up to for some multiplayer - you will get bored very soon.

												If you're looking for a complicated game with lots of choices to make, avoid this game. Every unit is, essentially, identical. Only 2-3 have any real ""special"" uses or ""abilities"". The bland differences between races makes the game seem very homogenized and combined with the terrible sound effects, made it hard to play.The graphics are pretty good, and while the campaign is short, there are some pretty awesome cenematics!If you have money to waste, and are looking for a solid game to sink a few hours into, go for it. Otherwise, avoid this title and wait for the RTS genre to find its footing again. The boring gameplay and macro combat made this game a real snooze-fest.			"

												I believe there is a huge following to RTS games. I have played almost every rts game to date. This game slightly fills the huge gap of non existing new rts games. The game plays well singleplayer and with decent graphics. However, multiplayer is another story, games tend to disconnect. Multiplayer is segregated by region, so good luck finding games. The factions are extremely unbalanced, good luck defeating the ""goo"" no matter which strategy you take. For example, ""goo"" artillery and Anti Air can climb walls and mountains. The other factions can SEE ONLY with expensive AIRCRAFT that wouldent be able to damage a cute rabbit let alone units designated to anti-air.  There is no such thing as rushing unless you are ""goo"". Multiplayer can be slow at times and it is difficult to adapt to changes in strategy, unless you are the ""goo"".  if you prepare for a rush and arent rushed you will be screwed in the long run no matter what. Have fun finding a balance of multiplayer play in this game, for its impossible. My verdict, this game is more luck then strategy. You will fight blindly, stick to your set strategy from the start and try to follow through and hopefully it will counter your enemys strategy. Roll the dice.			"

												The game has great cutscene graphics and overall the gameplay is fun to play.But i cant recommend this game because it lacks a lot of thing one should espect from a strategy title, like well defined and unique units, maybe some kind of rockpaperscissor unit types or race special powers. They try to do some of those stuff but dont deliver. In other aspects the music is plain and boring the sounds arent so good and the history didnt catch me.Maybe the worst comparisson this game can take is Red Alert 3, that game is like 7 years old and deliver everything this one lacks.Before buying this one try the C&C series, Starcraft, company of heroes, warhammer 4000 dawn of war, age of empire/mythologies, rise of nations/legends, supreme commander, impossible creatures, paraworld, ground control 2, direct action :act of war, LOTR:battle for middle earth, battle realms, universe at war:earth assault, z steel soldiers or even emperor battle for dune are better			"

												To me after having played the campaign, which was really short, this felt like another generic 3 faction RTS, with a bunch of gimmicks to make it want to be interesting, but fail at it. Nevertheless, it was fun while it lasted.And I'm saying: generic 3 faction RTS, because I will admit I have been spoiled with stuff like Red Alert 2's countries unique units and Generals ZH's Generals unique armies. I was hoping that Grey Goo could bring some of that.Basically this game was like the old school RTS: Build 1 blob of the same unit and attack move.Human faction, aren't human at all. The only human driver is the Alpha pilot, the rest is AI, plus it felt too limited in building space and thus ability. but perhaps there's just something I missed.The Goo, while an interesting concept, fell short in implementation. I've already posted my thoughts on what the Goo was lacking on the forums, but I came to that conclusion after only 2 missions of me playing as the Goo. There is just so much more that could've been done with the Goo.The Beta was the most fun for me to play as, since I personally like map-control. Be everywhere at once. And with their Hub system, I could really do what I wanted.As for the multiplayer: When I talked to Ted at Gamescom 2014 I expressed how important it is for and RTS t o have Replay and Observer mode in at launch, especially if the developpers want to work with the modding community and really push the PvP forward.At launch, there was neither. We had to wait a few months, but by then, I completely lost interest in this game. Otherwise I would've probably be streaming some PvP as observer.I am not going to recommend this game, because I personally feel it missed so many opportunities,  For me it fell off the radar as quickly as it came onto the radar.

												So...i played this for less than an hour and i saw enough of this game to make me not want to play it anymore.I am a long standing fan of RTS games having cut my teeth on Red Alert 2 and remained a fan of Command and Conquer until it was ruined by 4. When i saw the vids of this game i was enthralled by the goo and the visuals that reminded me of red alert 3. Unfortunatly the very first mission turned me off this game so hard. Where do i start on the issues...1) The units feel like they are made of paper. 2) The Units feel like they are armed with pea shooters. Seriously, basic base structures should not take this long to destroy with a mass of units.3) The game feels so slow and sluggish. Even basic units take ages to build.4) Restrictions on unit numbers and on how you build your base. This isnt halo wars...5) Poorly explained mechanics? The tutorial mission helpfully left out the part about exploding structures damaging your own units...6) The map design was very boring, even for a tutorial. In all the game badly wants to be red alert but fails. Red Alert is charming, quick and fun...this is anything but. If you a RTS fan, stick to the command and conquer franchise or Red Alert one. This game, for its few interesting game mechanics (goo and using trees as cover) is not worth the money.			"

												Not a huge fan.  While I see what the game was going for, I'm just not enjoying the campaign, the story, or the gameplay.Playing against Humans (AI) Hasn't been incredibly challenging provided I can use arty or bombers to destroy power lines.  Against the goo, the AI is fiendishly difficult since the 'mother goo's' are all perfectly synchranized as they move from resource to resource.  That aside, my undectible scouts are found 9/10 times while moving forward of my advancing army to flush out arty.  If you don't use scouts then the enemy artillary will crush them.  If you're using artillary, the result is so so (generally enemies are moving too fast to have much effect).I've been a fan of RTS games for years (cut my teeth on warcraft).  While there's some interesting game play here, I found that I basicly don't have enough time to micro-manage my armies, resources, and claim the objective.  Generally this isn't a problem, but I find without constantly repairing turrets/walls - Either my defense or offense crumbles.Without repair units, medics, or any ability to automate - I've found the game to be just a chore of clicking the repair button (annoyingly close to the sell button FYI), and dodging artillary.5/10.  I was quasi entertained for a while but neither the mechanics, units, story, or gameplay is compelling enough for me to keep this game going.  Should have waited for the summer sale. "

												as of 2/13/2015 i would not recommend buying this game at least not if you planned on playing it for the multiplayer...campaign 7.5/10gamplay 7/10music 8/10 although the soundtrack does get a little repetative after a whileand now the reason i am not recommending the purchase of this game9/10 multiplayer matchmaking games end with one person losing connection to the game its not only disheartening but infuriating as well waiting 3 - 5 minutes for a game during peak gaming hours only to be able to play 15 minutes into the match and then have someone disconnect almost every time is unbelievable. I'm not sure how this game a rts game (a genre with multiplayer as a primary draw) gets released onto the market with multiplayer so broken that its mostly unplayable.I really hope that they fix the multiplayer and i'll keep watching but if you wanted a rts and planned on playing mp don't buy this game.

												Ive been playing lots of RTS games from Warcraft 2 to Command and Conquer and maybe more since. But this game is as generic of a game I have ever played.The game has really ridiculously tidious restrictions on players for example you need to build a small hub to later build a large hub. So if you have no use for a small hub it is a waste of time/resources.. The UI has its moments with things having hot keys but its all in a small stripe on the bottom of your screen.Added to that the glitches and bugs Ive encountered it doesnt really make you too excited about this game. But most of all its just not fun to me. I love the type of game but I just dont find the races appealing, They try to be different and interesting but theres no fun and interactive differences in the ways of playing them. I mean sure the alien race plays differently but its just a reheating of the alien race of Earth 2160 which was better executed in my opinion.Your opinion may vary but I simply didnt enjoy playing this game.

												As a great fan of past C&C titles going all the way back to Dune II, I had high hopes for this game. Unfortunately, I simply cannot recommend it. It's not that there is something terribly wrong with it, per se; it's more about what isn't there. And what it lacks is soul. We're talking generic units and generic gameplay forming a generic by-the-numbers RTS with no flavor or personality. Add the fact that it consistently crashed for me on the second campaign mission, and it didn't take me long to request a refund. I'm still waiting and holding out hope for another great RTS to come along, but unfortunately this wasn't it.			"

												tl;dr: If you came for single player and the story - AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!-------------This high-priced game was bought for its unique story, told in beautiful graphics and masterful dialogues.And, well, it has both, but not much else. The story inside the game is virtually nonexistent - you're just thrown into the battle with not explaination provided as to why, who and against whom. The campaign mode is extremely short and seems like an overgrown tutorial, a precursor for... multiplayer, I guess. Which I personally don't play, so no comments there.The game does not give you a cohesive storyline, it provides no explaination of its events or faction motivations, and generally lacks in information, even in background one (C&C3 in-game library, anyone?).Apart from that, it's a back-to-roots game of build a base, spam units and shoot everyone who looks at you funny. It boasts an emphasis on large-scale decision-making, but is actually completely linear and never ever deviates from a singular ""spawn tanks, shoot guys"" decision.Add horrible screen tearing during pre-rendered custscenes (WTH? 0_o), and you get a game which is kind of OK... for half of its sale price.Yes, it is better than C&C4, but that's setting the bar too low.

												Well what i can say...Good thing is that cinematics are made good in graphic and it feels a bit red alert franchise with some starcraft 2 elements...Bad things...1.Single player campaign is realy stupid... One part is where humans destroying all Betas and than shows cinematic where Betas is more like friends... Kill 1000+ Betas population and lets be friends... Second part is where that drone guy sacrifice him self to save all... And that retard crying scene... Ok humans actualy have two peoples in all game, but Betas have its ppl in all units... So why not sacrifice any Betas unit...? Short version... Story is stupid and its more like parody of alien wars than real battle for planet...2.Multyplayer is dead...3.Graphics are actualy bad, but to run need good pc...4.All units are very simular and same mechanism just added few race changes... But still its simular and boring...ill give it 3/10...			"

												I was wondering where all the RTS games where, starting to get depressed because maybe nobody will even try making one ever again in this mess of cruddy, half made sack of empty promises of early access games on here, but then, this game popped up! and I was like 'oh god finally someone made a RTS game that looks decent!'. I waited for a sale, got the game and ended up with a... very shallow and dull RTS game sadly. I wish I could say this game is RTS of the year but it really can't be, there are so many other RTS games that do the genre so much better, this game wears itself thin extreamly fast and offers nothing new to have fun with, its a pretty, bog standard, run of the mill, every day pair of socks RTS game. =/ And yes it's pretty, it has a great graphics style going for it and good visuals but that's sadly the only thing I can say it does well and everyone that plays games knows the game mechanics and gameplay are always more important, that's where the soul and fun of the game is.Was I expecting something original in an RTS game? I guess not, but since ive already done the RTS grind a million times in other games, build orders, favourite units, favourite play styles to finish the enemy base off, favourite faction ect this just sadly feels like the same old RTS grind, but not in a fun way. Why tho? I believe it's becuase of variety and depth. The fact of the matter is there hardly is any, you end up using some units to your play style and not using any of the others generally cas they just plain suck, are too micro intensive, or don't fit your playstyle so what you end up with is 3 or 4 units you actually like to attack with and that... really is not that interesting is it? Sure there are technologies that add some additional cool things to your units as well, that adds depth right? No not really, most of the techs for all factions are very situational or are for very specific playstyles, it takes alot of trial and error to find ones that don't actually suck... oh and yea the tech limit only allowing you to take one out of each of the five slots, that's just annoying! if I could take all the upgrades even if it was one at a time my units might actually feel like they are getting strong enough to do something. Also their is one resource in this game that you have to manage, yes, just one, and generally it's automated once you get the harvester down leaving the player to sit back and do nothing but watch until they get enough income to actually do anything with... so engaging! yay.Generally the stragety of this game is, build big base -> build lots of units -> attack -> lose them all to defenses -> attack with more units - > if they die just spam more units -> win. Yea it's litterly that simple that a brain dead monkey could do it, every time, that's how I won, ultimatly the only way to win is just spam units at the enemy, the good ones that is, not the weak crappy ones that would take years to kill anything. =/ And thats for -every- faction, you can be sneaky and go around to the back of the base and case chaos sure, but generally that fails or takes forever. You can try spam artillery at the base sure, that sometimes work, oh how about spamming some stealth units at the base and sneak in and take out their economy!. How about spam some air units at them that should do some damage! nope not really, air units take forever to do anything having to come all the way back to base to reload and are shot down super easily, you see where im going with this? There are ultimate end game units tho yea! you could just charge one at the enemy base and assume it will go great and you will win yay, that works too but it takes years to build one of those so you may as well just spam combat units anyway, plus it's... not even slightly fun, does it sound like fun? Just sitting there right clicking buildings again and again to make it bomb them... They dont even feel that tough and powerful, kinda just like a giant dinky unit that slowly trudges along and does stuff and they all pretty much function in the same way for all factions so don't hope for variety with the ultimates either cas their really isen't any.Just like almost every RTS game ever starting the base up and getting the economy takes awhile too, but in this game it seems to take forever! It took me a good 10-20 minutes or more especially with the Goo faction to get things going and it just feels like the game drags on forever... probably becuase there is just so little fun to find here. Man I wished this game was more fun... but it's really not, please take my word on it or at least be aware of unfortunate downsides I took the time to point out before buying or playing this game. =( If you get immediatly bored of this game in the first 2 hours then just get a refund, it's an extreamly expensive game for how little content it has so your only doing yourself a favor. I wish the devs the best and hope they are able to make better games from this and grow but this was just so dissapointing and boring for me. I don't really think there is any way they can make this game feel like a fun, deep RTS now that it seems fully built but maybe they can if they added a butt load more mechanics, units and maybe a couple more factions, 3 factions is... again, very poor variety if you compared it to Supreme commander: Forged Alliance which is basically the ultimate RTS on steam still with how much depth it has and unit variety.Once I finished single player I realized this game is just a really not fun waste of time, the game speed/pace is super slow by default and there is horrifyingly no way to speed up game time, why?! Every good RTS game lets you speed up time so the game goes at a pace that fits how intense you want it, the pacing could have been easily fixed with a speed setting so it's just a shame there isen't one to be found. And for all these reasons I can't possible recommend this game for the price it's at, for as how well made and pretty it may be its a generic RTS borefest and I would highly recommend getting it at about 10-15 dollars at most or playing another RTS with more depth, they are out there just look. I rarely had any fun throughout the singleplayer campain and there is no way im going to touch mutliplayer since I hardly believe it will offer anything differant so it's already time to let this game sit in my steam libary and grow dust, such a shame. =/ Sadly is a 4.5/10 for me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------More basic outline of the pros and cons of the game for people looking for a review in a hurry.Pros:+ Great visual style and graphics+ Almost no bugs at all+ Game runs pretty well most of the time, I never dipped below 60-50 fps (GTX 680, i5 overclocked, 16 gig RAM)+ Amazing voice acting and character animation in cut scenes, the debrief screens almost make the characters look real with how good the facial animations are!+ Well designed single player missions, hardly got stuck at all except the last mission+ Original and refreshing storyline+ Good music and audio, could use more variety thoCons:- Very few graphics and gameplay options- Very slow game speed and pacing to the game, no speed setting (if there even is one). As such the game feels like it drags on alot of the time especially at the start.- Very sparse unit variety- Very basic economy management- Small building variety- Small Technology variety, only allows you to upgrade very few units at once- Small faction variety- Very little tactical choices that work- Ultimates unit's don't feel powerful, generally end up slowing down the pace of the game- Single player transitions between the factions weirdly, would have made so much more sense to make the faction missions seperate or just tell the player what faction they are going to have to play to progress.- Most units feel weak and do little damage			"

												I'm playing RTS genre since DUNE so i think i can say i saw/played hundreds of titles. Some of them were simple some complex and i understand that not every single game need to be the same. That's why whe ni saw Grey Goo i decided to buy it to get classic RTS like Command & Conquer series and that's what i'v got! Most of negative reviews dont understand that not every RTS must be Total War etc. There is place for games where you just build/train/destroy without xx upgrades and asian micro (Starcraft way). Not everyone want to play pressing 10 buttons same time and keep everything in control for every second of game just because if not then you lose.So keeping that in mind Grey Goo is superb RTS with nice graphic and sound (first game where i didnt turned off music) where you can just fight with enemy without thinking how many units every type you must have or you lose (in Starcraft every single unit count - here not)But there are some problems so far - mostly with multiplayer because they have region lock and it's hard to find anyone to play with.+Game style+Graphic+Music+Races playing different ways+Campaign hard and with proper plot-At this point multiplayer with lack of players (region lock) and maps/modesI would be glad to get some DLC with more few more units (might be crazy things like Tanya in RA ;) )			"

												While the graphics are beautiful and the game itself is really nice to play, the biggest problem and quite laughably is the load time between missions and mission restarts. I have a high end gaming rig and a 2 minute+ load screen is bizarre, a couple of times i thought my PC had frozen but, no, it was still loading. This really is the off putting reason not to buy this game. Luckily i bought it in the 60% discount sale and didnt waste too much money on it.  I reached mission 3 and i believe it will remain there till i forget how long the load times are and dive back in, to then jump back out. I am shocked that a game has been placed on sale with this load lag problem.			"

												Plagued with the same glaring issues that most every RTS has. -Your units are stupid and won't do anything effectively without micromanaging the hell out of them using macros and bidning them and babysitting them constantly. You can select a group of units and tell them to walk in a direction. The fast ones won't slow down for the slower ones and end up trickeling into their own demise. They will also walk past enemies that are firing on them and ignore them as they die. If you use attack move, they will stop and fire at any stupid 10billion health wall and never get to their destination. You have to micro manager them like crazy to get anything done. Its just a huge wall of unnessiary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to have to learn to get into the genre, and I hate it. There should be many variations of attack move, and ways to command your units to do things more intelligently rather than babysitting them when you want to focus on something else. The mark of a good RTS player is that they can not only do this, but do it in many places at once while still focusing on the big picture (macro) which brings me to my next huge complaint.The macro is the same old same old remember an exact set of openings and folling them to a T as fast as you possible can. It pisses me off that a game with STRATEGY in the name of the genre is more about memorizing optimal patterns, repeating them hundreds of times so you can do them faster than the next guy, and honing your ability to click hundreds of times and minute (most of which are just directing your braindead units to doing the most simplest of takss). I was drawn to this game because it was hyped to fix the issues with the direction RTS games have taken. It was said to put the strategy back in to RTS and take it away from being what the genre really should be named... CPM (Clicks per minute) because that is all this genre is.			"

The game: Grey Goo is a real time strategy (RTS) game with a very atmospheric introduction to the game via a campaign that features “life-like” looking aliens in video sequences. It features aspects and mechanics that make it a really good RTS game after the first look:	The controlling of the units and buildings is easy to pickup. The camera controls work fine.	It is possible to make building queues and set rally points, group your units and give them numbers.	There is one kind of resource in the game that can be extracted automatically after you        construct a specific building.	The game has a nice, fast pace to it, but not crazy fast like others in the genre.	A nice addition to the usual aspects of the genre was the way to get to higher tier technology in Grey Goo. In similar games we generally have to build a special structure and sometimes have to upgrade certain technologies there to be able to construct or recruit certain unit types. In  Grey Goo you have to build a more generalized production building and then can decide via adding different attachments which unit types you want to be able to build in that specific factory. This makes it possible to change relatively fast into producing a flying unit instead of an artillery or a stealth tank instead.At the beginning of the campaign we find ourselves in the middle of a crisis on an alien planet that has some trouble with aggressors. You take control of a commander of that alien race and have to complete different objectives. You are eased into the game in the first mission. And the second mission is already pretty demanding, I would recommend to start out on easy difficulty if you don´t play RTS games on a regular basis.The game gives you all the information you need to manage your command with the help of a mini-map (featuring different filters), audio responsive units, a zoomable, turnable point of view, a resource intake/output estimation and mission objectives shown on the mini-map. The variety in units seems to be quite large for the starting faction. As I haven´t played other factions yet, I cannot say more. It seemed quite balanced in terms of being able to counter enemy forces with the right kind of units. But that is tough to say after one session only. See other reviews for more information on that topic.Look and feel and sound: The game looks spectacular, especially in the videosequences. The music during the missions and especially in combat is really well done and one of the reasons I am reminded of older games in the RTS genre. The pacing of the game, the placing of buildings and the grouping and ordering of units reminded me very much of Command & Conquer (Red Alert), Star Craft 1, Warcraft 2 and a little of Dune 2(000) without the concrete.Captains Orders:If you like RTS games and want to try a game that is not Starcraft, go for Grey Goo! If you are tired of fantasy based strategy games in general, try Grey Goo. If you enjoy having nice music and visuals in a game that is nothing completely new but rather well done and 100% completed, give it a try! I definitely recommend having this game in your library!Verdict: Grey Goo is a real treasure and will be featured in the “Land Ho! with CaptN3mo” series.

												Maybe Im missing something but this game seems very BLAN and not exciting. The units all fire the same type of projectile either multipule times or single shot for all races (with exception of the Super Units). All the units look ridiculous, including the human race which i was hoping for a breath of familiarity with all the alien vehicles but was met with even odder designs. Maybe I need to commit more to this, but from what I have seen so far I would like my money back.			"

												I'm trying to like it, but I can't.  Steep learning curve is a massive understatement.  Maybe I'm just not liking the starting race in the campaign, but the tech progression is a bit wonky and the tutorial is clear as mud.  Seems like the only way to get anywhere is by tank rushing over and over and over and over while the enemy tank rushes you over and over and over and over.  Your troops move with all the intelligence they did in Warcraft I.  I guess the focus is on macro instead of micro management, but I just can't click with it.  I'm sad, because the cutscenes are a great throwback to RTS games of old.  I'll keep trying.			"

												While I was excited after reading several of the reviews, this game falls very flat for me.  Price point is definitely much too high for what you are getting in the game.+Graphics are very beautiful+Interface is simple and straightforward-Units are all the same across factions just with a different skin it seems-The tank rush is as always the only viable tactic in the game-The Single Player Campaign does not make a lot of sense; the story is not that engrossing.-Single Player AI does one thing, builds a lot of units (30+) and rushes your base-AI seems very simple when it comes to behavior-The tech upgrade tree isn't really an upgrade tree, it’s just which of these three abilities would like you like game.  You cannot unlock them all, only one for each tech upgrade type.-Game will crash when uses Epic units depending on what is around them. "

Story in grey goo is told as if you have already heard all the detail and its an over view of major events. You don't care about any of the charaters and feel no real engadment during game play because every mission is the same the races are one note strategy. This game could have been something special poor writting and poor misson planning make it a bad RTS.			"

												A swarming race, a strange alien race, and a human race in an RTS game based in space. Never done before, totally original idea.That was sarcasm. For this price, go buy Starcraft 2, exact same game, except Starcraft 2 has a lot more unit diversity, vastly superior artwork, longer single player campaigns, a better storyline, a vast multiplayer player base, a lot more strategies to pick from, better game customization, better controls, more frequent game updates... ect. ect.If you are going to make something that is blatantly a redo (or more approprietly a ripoff) to a popular (and still active) game, at least do a few things better, and if you can't do that, don't try to ask for the same AAA price.

												Good cutscenes in single player campaign, that's about it though. I admit that I didn't give it enough of a chance but that is only because the game itself is bland and places unnecessary restrictions (structure building is hampered by hub structures). Graphics are pretty average too. Skirmish feels very rushy, when I select ""Easy, Defensive"" as my opponent I expect an opponent that turtles up for at least 10 to 15 minutes before making an attack, instead I get 6 units arriving at my base within 2 minutes of the game starting.

I beat the campaign on the hardest difficulty in probably 4 or 5 hours, then started playing the multiplayer to discover that it's more boring than the campaign in refference to replayability.But that wasn't the nail in the coffin, i didn't mind that it was boring; unacknowledged ignorance and presumptive understanding will cause that. I continued playing. I don't know what rank i started at, but within 3 days i was rank 50 and beating people who had utterly crushed me days before. Then i learned the most crippling thing about the game.The engine, i guess what it's called, the micro mechanic for goo, is the worst♥♥♥♥♥♥in the world; stay with me. This alone isn't why it's a♥♥♥♥♥♥game, a single thing which is innefficient doesn't matter, it's RTS, it's expected.

												I really tried to like this game. It's just too simple for me. I can see how this can become complex, but I really want a wider range of units, buildings and upgrades. I feel like there really can only be a few strategies. I can seige with one of 2 seige units, but the unit AI isn't really that great so I do have to macro a bit to make up for it. I can try to overwhelm my enemy with mass and try not to let my unit ball get hurt by air or seige, or I can simply keep walling and pushing my enemy into a corner, and try to out last his resources. I'm not a fan of the way the buildings work either, notes, and stuff that connects to nodes. It's cool, but I'd like a little bit for freedom.That being said, the campaign was done VERY well. The artwork is fantastic, there is a big audiance of people that game will work well for, but just not me. I think they should have some type of demo setup, I dropped 49.99 on it, and It's just not for me, and now I own it. Maybe when my kids are old enough, I'll just let them play on my account.

												I was really looking forward to this game but as with a good 95% of strategy games nowerdays it was below par.  The interface is clunky and the game doesn't run smoothly.  My system is beyond the recommended requirements and all the graphics settings are turned to minimum; which with how clunky it is was a challenge setting.  The game feels like it needs to go though about 30 optermisation and ballance patches, you can tell there was never a proper beta.There is also barely any strategy, its just a spamfest with whoever has the most units wins.

												Repetitive gameplay with all races being pretty much the same (just cosmetic changes). Missions are unbalanced where some are laughably easy and others depend on pure luck. Once you unlock all upgrades in tech tree it's the end of campaign so you can't even have fun with it. Unit limit seems artificial and you feel like it prevents you to have fun. Unit movement is slow so quite often you just sit and wait for your units to move.TL;DR play Earth 2160 instead			"

												I went into Grey Goo wanting to like it, the steam reviews seemed so bright with promise of maybe someone had revived my old favorite Command and Conquer. I have to say it is true in a way it stongly resembles Command and Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight otherwise known as the game that sunk the C&C franchise. You get one base and everything branches off that soo no building satalite bases to control resources or block check points. Your units all behave the same its just re-skins, the ai spawns units onto the battlefield where they need to be nothing is build at their base unless you are in the base attacking it.The Goo from the title can spawn from any resource node when the computer plays them, sad you never get that power. You get 4 paths to upgrade on which you can pick one option each. The Super units range from usefull(human), mobile factory(beta), to waste of resources(goo), the one shining light in this swamp of cookie cutter bland game play and cheating ai is the story. Very well written chars come across as people with goals and personality. What ultimately killed it for me was the endless crashing. When Grey Goo crashes it does not do so tidily sooo much forum diving later it was found out the only way to get it back after crash is to delete game+steam instalalation then re-install both. In summery not worth it now maybe in a year they will fix the bugs.			"

												A little dissapoing expected something diffrent i suppose. Over all quality of the game isn't bad just a little boring to be honest its nice to get away from all the micro managaing but the gameplay over all is pretty slow. At first glance it seems like there's a lot of buildings/units but they all kinda look/feel the same so it feels kinda like you got screwed on diversty. But they do make up for it with the race's each one is very much there own which is very nice to. Some other postives would be the the cut scenes beautifuly done. Feels a bit skimpy on the single player missions as well only 15 total missions 5 for each race. Seems like they were leaning more towards a multi player based game and if that's the case i ceartinly wouldn't buy for 50 bucks.7/10 good game but needs more diversty over all. Units look to much a like hard to tell apart lack of tech upgrades and short campaing.If you're not a die hard RTS fan wait till its on sale for 20-30 dollars.			"

There's basically no strategy beyond ""build a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of units, spam until nothing is left.""It's like C&C and Starcraft had a child, and that child was never quite sure what it wanted to be. The goo are hilariously overpowered, and the Beta units feel soft and worthless. Never got around to playing as the humans, after a single match you'll be so tired of spamming ""repair"" on the buildings hit by AOE you'll never want to hear the AI announcer saying ""wall under attack wall under attack wall under attack wall under attack wall under attack wall under attack wall under attack  base under attack units under attack"". They feel the need to announce every single individual unit being attacked.Do I recommend this game? I guess if you loved Starcraft's spammy ""build a thousand units and right click attack move"", I certainly regret spending $50 on it.			"

												I've played just about every decent title of RTS games since the late 90's. This game falls under the category of OKAY. With that being said, I can not recommend the game at it's current price of $50. There are 3 factions, each very unique. There is a decent amount of units, and the game feels fairly balanced. The main con to me is that its just not very exciting. I'm not one to normally gripe about graphics, but the battle animations are boring. Theres no cool explosions, no cool unit movements, etc. I have not played enough of the game to make the following assumption, but I have a feeling that the only thing it takes to win a battle of Grey Goo is having a higher number of units, and not necessarily a batter strategy. For that reason, and for the $50 price tag, I do not recommend the game. Wait for the price to go down. Check out Supreme Commander 1, Supreme Commander 2 as other options for now.			"

												Whatever happened to the RTS that was like the first of it's kind - Dune?I don't play games to be frustrated at every turn.  I don't play games that tell you you have to build a massive base with nothing in order to get any units to defend it with.  I don't play games that tell you that if you don't get it done yesterday you lose, especially when those same games tell you you're supposed to swarm the map with ... what?  Your good looks!?Sure, people will say I just don't get this game.  But those self-same people will say I don't get games like Civilization, which was always notorius for swamping you with battleships and cannons when you're just figuring out agriculture!  Worse still, Civilazation cheats like a mofo!Was Dune the only game that didn't cheat like a mofo?  What happened to fair games?Keep in mind, I've been playing on ""easy"" to learn how to play!  And since I am referencing ""Dune"" it should be obvious that I'm not new to the genre!  And yet, somehow, even on ""easy,"" I'm still losing again and again and again!It was a total waste of money.  I would have been better off spending that money on something else.  Like groceries.  Or four or five cheaper games that would be easier to play.""Good game play.""  ""Balanced mechanics.""  B-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-gus!If you really like challenges, then this game for you.But if you really like challenges, then you won't mind giving up all your money, throwing away all your stuff, giving your landlord the finger, and finding a place to sleep on the street, either.  And if you like challenges, you won't mind living on the street while trying to find a place to go potty, find a way to keep what little of your stuff you were able to keep dry, and just plain keep what little of your stuff you were able to keep.Nothing like trying to keep warm in the weather when there's frost on the ground.  Or trying to find a safe place to sleep that isn't directly on the ground somewhere.Of course, if you've never had such a challenge, I'm sure this game will be very exciting for you.  But if you like challenges, that's the challenge of a lifetime!  And after you've done that, you'll wonder why you bothered giving yourself the headaches games like this incur.""Well balanced"" my♥♥♥♥♥♥""Five Man Civil War"" would be an easier game.  You and your five buddies decide to revolt against the government using nothing but plastic silverware!  Certainly an easier game than this one is!			"

												A.I pathfinding is shonky, most units tend to be incredibally weak, Beta towers take forever to destroy, units get stuck trying to manuever around one another, some campaign missions are near impossible to beat e.g the final mission requires you to defend 3 seperate points while trying to hold them from enemies that just keep coming. it's hard to defend something like that with such small and easily destroyed numbers.The main title screen is laggy as hell. Tried 3 mintutes to start a game.And throughout the campaign, you end up loading 2 times to start one mission. It gets old... fast.The Beta race is ok but their commando units become obselete once larger untis beome avaliable.The humans have strong armored tanks, which leaves their smaller units with no damage output and no health to do anything with.The Goo are all around weak and extremely hard to micro manage with constant reinforcing because their units no matter what it is are so weak in comaprison to the enemies they're up agains't. I've spent 4 hours trying to not get nuked or wiped out by small squads of Beta's or human drones as the goo. The campaign missions as the beta are good, but as soon as the goo comes to play, that's where it gets irritating. You end up spending hours trying to not get swarmed at first, then more hours trying to track all those slippery mother goos.And all this was on the easy setting. the A.I is too damn hard and your units are too damn weak in comparison.Though the game has potential. It does have a great story to it. Unique and beautiful landscapes and unit design is good too.Have yet to try multiplayer though. but I'd rate this a 6/10 game.			"

												This game took about 5 minutes to start each time. This is an ongoing bug that the developers have yet to fix and hide all posts in a subsection on the forum. Once the game actually does start, there are random crashes. The developers seem to be doing nothing about either of these issues. For the time that I did spend in the game, it was pretty mediocre. The gameplay was typical of any RTS with nothing really new to be had. I returned it for a full refund. Unless they can fix the extra long startup bug and crashing, I cannot recommend the game. Even then, I would be on the edge about it for the short duration that I played. Of course, I played less than 2 hours, so that should be taken into consideration. I hope they fix the issues, as I would probably rebuy and update my review.			"

												If you're reading this, no, this game is not what you think it is, and no, it's not Westwood's comeback.In its current state, it's a messy game in which I keep forgetting it's not in the Alpha stage. This is a full release. Lot's of mistakes made, too many to list here. Biggest complaint overall is there's no sense of 'choice' when you play. The units are so categorized it's either you build them or you lose. The strategy is written for you. It's a matter of how competent you are of the rules and if the clunkiness of the units pathfinding and fighting goes in your favor.			"

												I purchased this game with the hope that it would hold up as a continuation of the gameplay I loved in the early Command and Conquer games. Though reminicint of these games it does not carry the torch as brightly as I had hoped. Grey Goo plays much more like the Starcraft series.  The campaign features live action and beautifully rendered cutscenes and cinematics. The story is decent so far, and progression through the campign is steady, unlocking deeper units and structures as you play. I have not had a chance to play multiplayer, but instead spent some time seeing how a full skirmish match would go. This is where I noticed some problems, which make me regret purchasing this game. First, the population cap really puts a damper on gameplay, and resources feel too limited when trying to stretch out a game. One match was a 2v2 which we could not complete because resources had been completed depleted. This amounted to a stalemate, which actually ended in a crash from the game itself. Some thoughts, experiences and suggestions:- Players should have the ability to set the population cap higher.- Make resources non-depletable, or recover quicker. (See not below*)- Offer deeper customization for skirmish and online matches.- Units often get stuck while moving around other units or structures- My installation has crashed numerous times.I give this game a thumbs down, not because it is a bad game, but because I do not recommend. Grey Goo doesn't stand out as any different or better than games that already exist. Sure, it looks pretty, and sounds good, but the mechanics of the game are old, stale, and a leave me with an itch for something more. Level Editor:I played around with the editor for a little while. It crashed a couple of times when trying to open preferences and options menus from the toolbar. I have little experience with these kinds of tools, but it seemed simple for those who do. I did not see any settings for adjust variables such as population caps, or anything to do with game options.*Note* : Attempting any sort of longer game in skirmish mode turns into a resource capturing game, once all the resources run out the game effectively becomes a stalemate. This, for me at least, really feels limiting, and gives me less incentive to play defensively or approach any more nuanced strategies. Instead, a typical game turns into a constant barrage of micro-managing the sporadic (and somewhat janky) movement of troops and the perpetual rebuilding of said troops.			"

												Worst Strategy game I’ve ever played (If I try very hard not to remember SupCom2). Everything about this game, missions, units, ""game play mechanics"" is bland and boring, except for the story in an all too short campaign. Sadly I didn’t really understand how awful it was till I could no longer get a refund.			"

												Luckily my only performance issues have been very low framerate on the menu only, so Ive been able to play a little without being distracted by poor performance.My first impression was that it seemed pretty cool and I was excited to get into a new game. However it quickly became apparent that the only strategy is build as many units as possible, mass them together and zerg. Maybe there is more, that was just my disappointing impression after the ooh and ahh wore off. I was further disappointed when I realized how few units there were, and how few tech upgrades were available. It took me about 5 minutes to read the game encyclopedia info for all units and tech for each race. What struck me even worse was realizing that each race basically has the same units, they just look different. Everyone has the same units basically, even the goo which just appears wildly different at first. I spent maybe an hour max on the game and lost interest. I got way more out of Puzzle Quest for $2.99.  This is not worth $50 period. Its not bad, just very shallow and generic once you look beneath the surface.Dont buy, there are much better options out there.			"

												Sadly, while I love Petroglyph and I love Frank Klepacki. This game has an interesting set of races and mechanics, lore, amazing music and visuals.I have yet to play any of it. The game simply will not launch. This isn't a computer related error either. As you can see for yourself on the forums there is some error built into the game that no one seems to have publicaly announced a solution too that just prevents the game from launching. It will sit there and hang or stop responding. I have not found any work arounds to this issue and it greatly killed my mood to play this game after I was so eager to try a new RTS game.The games low population, and seemingly abundance of issues doesn't make this game very wanted. I wish I could recommend this game but I simply can't.Maybe next game.			"

But I can't recommend something which has such an error.  Hopefully it is wide spread enough that the devs will look into it and fix it.

												This is solely based on singleplayer Campaign Experience yet:I'm not sure about it, it's good but it's not great. For a reduced price i could recommend it, but not for 40 Euros. The gameplay is cool with the 3 races but at some point it becomes a very nasty grind especially with the goo as you struggle controlling them as all units in the game feel very fragile, and you DO actually need to do quite some micromanaging at least with control groups and keeping your AA units and the likes separate otherwise they happily sacrifice themselves by running into the front of everything. (This problem is relevant for the Goo's mostly)I can't agree on the campaign being great, it deteriorated especially in the last missions into a tower defense game with a race that doesn't suit a ""hold point A,B and C"" gameplay, very frustrating and not really engaging as you're constantly going back and forth. I didnt fail because it was to difficult, it felt chaotic and i got bored.  The units on the Beta and Human side seem very interchangable and loose their appeal very quick unfortunately. If you have bland units then at least give them names that reveal what they do (see Supreme Commander as a good example). I played the whole campaign and still couldn't name the majority of the units and what they do, you have to constantly look up in the build menues what they do.You can see what the developers tried with the income counter like in Supreme Commander, but in the game itself you will hardly have a look there, it just doesnt matter in the end ironically. And thats what i felt about the game overall, cool ideas, execution ok, didn't come together, what a shame, you see that the dev's really put alot of thought into this. But the good reviews are just not doing other games justice i'm sorry.I cannot comment on the multiplayer value, but the price is to steep for what it is if you look at what's available today otherwise (CoH, Wargame, Starcraft etc.).7.5 / 10 if it wasn't about price. 6.5 / 10 overall			"

												While Beta and Humans have good range of attack and many units shoot when move, for Goo it shows all the fail of game. Unit movement AI is very poor. Notifications that units under attack not shown on map. Micromanagement amount for goo is overhelming (while for Beta and Humans u can hide under defences and build your force).So from some fun and great visuals (on easy difficulty) it turned to mind blowing burden of constant management if everything.And goo tecj upgrades are so minor and uselsssss...

												I really want to like this game, but I just can't. I have a computer that's well beyond the recommended specs, and even on low settings the game is constantly choppy. I have even taken precaution to close everything before I start this game, but to no avail. It spikes and constantly goes down to a 10-15 fps drop even when nothing is happening. It will periodically do this, and then lose the commands you sent your units.Speaking of units, let me get into the actual review. The little time I was actually able to play this game through the choppy lag it wasn't fun at all. The movement commands are rough, and the pathing in this game absolutely blows chunks. You tell your units to attack move to a location and they go running off towards it, but fail to actually engage any enemy units. This is especially true for air units, their pathing and ability to attack enemy units is absolutely awful. You have to constantly be issuing commands to them. Want to queue your bombers to drop payload and return back to the hangar? Too bad, they will run up to the enemy, whirl around them once or twice, drop a bomb, whirl around them again, and then just hang out above the enemy. Several times I was issuing patrol commands to my air units to only have them stop in a random spot in the map. Oh and by the way the units in this game are severly unbalanced. I would post more review, however this is all the time I'm willing to commit to the game. Don't waste your 50$, its not worth it. Just spend 5-10$ to get C&C packages and you'll be a lot happier if you just play those. This game tries so hard to be appealing to all the different RTS crowds but just fails.  "

												When i bought this game i thought to myself "" Hey.. this game must be really good... its made by the guys who brought us games like Red Alert and Command And Conquer... Surely it must be a great game"". Boy was i wrong.I cant call this game a disaster, because there are many games that go in that catagory.This game is beyond disaster.The units are no-where close to original and are a few in number. You could, if you wanted to, use only 2-3 units at most to play this game. Building revolves around placing hubs and building on those hubs.. which is very restrictive and pointless.The Characters are a absolute bore and annoying. Just hearing the ""Beta"" Faction talk in that Hilly Billy Australian / South African accent, makes me want to mute the sound while i find a hammer or rock to break the speakers ( and Im Australian ). The campaign will put you to sleep if you make it far enough. And this game is on no level close to the Command and conquer series... not even the last few titles made by E.A.I dont see how reviews are cliaming its any good and comparing it to Command and conquer, and makes me wonder if they have played those games at all.Watch video reviews before you buy this dud.

												My short time with the game was nothing more than pure frustration mostly due to the restrictions for building a base. To keep the review short, I hate the attachment requirement for buildings and hangers. I mean who's idea was it to restrict the productions and units to certain hanger attachments? You want to make a air unit? well you need certain building attached with another certain building in a hub or whatever its called. This game totally takes the freedom of building bases away from you due to this one stupid idea, Otherwise it would have been an excellent RTS. Message to the devs:Any game that restricts the players on how they wanna play the game needs to be buried and forgotten. If you think that you are a developer with some bright idea that limits the game play then you shouldn't be making games. I was a huge C&C fan and still play those games on my Origin account. There were all excellent because of the freedom it gave the players. I could build my base the way I wanted and not by trying to attach this building to another so I can make a unit. You guys as developers could have build an excellent RTS but instead you went a ruined it. End of story			"

												A lot of people, including me, are having major performance issues on fantastic hardware. The $50 price point was already a little steep, so don't even thinking about spending it until these issues are fixed.EDIT: Let me reiterate to the downvoters and to the person in the comments already accusing me of not knowing how system specs work. This game is getting sub 20-fps on rigs running the best possible single GPU hardware available, while others running on almost identical hardware get 60fps. Something is wrong with the game. My specs are 8GB RAM, Phenom II X6 1055t, GTX 970, but, again, people with comparable or better specs are getting the same results across all GPU and CPU manufacturers.EDIT 2: Unfortunately, the problems have still not been fixed, and the multiplayer of the game is dead at this point. To compound this, balance issues are becoming apparent after these several weeks, and likely won't be addressed for longer. This review will likely stay permanently negative.			"

												Great cinematics and strong story but gameplay is a grind. Structures are too strong and your units are too weak and dumb. You can spend 10 minutes building a force and see it wiped in 20 seconds. Given how long the build times are the units should be stronger. Towers are way too strong. Basically the game needs a few patches and tweaks to really compete with C&C and Starcraft.			"

												EDIT 11/4/15:TL;DR: The game at its core is very good. Excellent gameplay, music, design and the single player campaign is sick a f. Multiplayer is no longer lacking in features, but still lacks population (to my extreme disappointment). Yet even after the release of free extra content, the game may still feel lithe to some, considering the cost. Rest assured however, that if you're partial to RTSes, you'll find plenty of value in Grey Goo. The reasons for which i originally gave this game a negative review have largely been fixed. After many patches of reworking faction's units, gameplay tweaks, bug fixes and extra content, the game is currently in stable and balanced form.My number one issue with the game when i first reviewed it was the player base, or lackthereof, and its still my biggest complaint. However, according to Steam stats, there were as many people (90) playing Grey Goo in the past half hour as there were playing in a given 24 hour period back when my review originally went up. So there has been steady progress on that front as more people pick up this title.I think if you like RTSes then Grey Goo is something you would enjoy. Pick it up.			"

												This is a great real-time strategy game, developed by some of the original team behind the Command & Conquer games, and it shows. Grey Goo features a similar resource system as the C&C games (a flow economy), but does away with the need to build power plants to generate energy. The latter move has been called into question in some corners and it does remove some of the nuance in the base-building aspect, but the game works fine without it. Grey Goo is named after the eponymous Goo faction, which consist of nano machines. They are a roving faction that don't need structures to create new units. Instead, park your main unit -- the Mother Goo -- on top of a catalyst (i.e. main resource) vent and, once the Mother Goo has grown to a sufficient size, split it in two to generate another Mother Goo or a prothean (which can be split into actual units). The Goo are one of the most interesting factions to come along in an RTS game in a long while and offer a different kind of challenge regardless of whether you're controlling them or fighting against them. The other two factions are also interesting. The humans are the most technologically advanced faction in the game, which makes for quite a nice change from most other games where humans are presented as the underdog. They field hover tanks and build bases using a system of conduits. They are ideals for those players who wish to turtle up. They can teleport structures and units around, which gives them a flexability that offsets the rigidity that building a human base initially seems to bring with it. The last faction are the Beta (the name that the humans have given them, actually). These are aliens and perhaps the most traditional of the factions in the game. You build hubs of various sizes and attach other modules to them, such as factories. They are the only faction in the game to field any type of infantry. Most of their units consist of vaguely dinosaur-shaped mechs, which give them a character all of their own. Like the humans, they are able to erect walls. This means that they can turtle up like the humans, but are also more flexible thanks to using hubs as the centre of their bases. Each of the factions also fields a single ""epic"" unit: the magnificent and deadly purger for the Goo, the Alpha for the humans (essentially a giant, floating robot with a human inside), and the Hand of Ruk (a flying fortress) for the Beta. Each faction also has five tech slots: you have to pick from three techs for every slot and they essentially serve as bonuses. The system is simple, but it works great. One of the things that the developers specifically set out to do is create an accessible RTS that emphasizes strategy over tactics. As a result, all units do one thing and one thing only. They don't have any special abilities that you need to worry about. Just create groups and focus on the bigger picture. Units move more slowly than, for example, in Command & Conquer and they are also a bit more durable (the structures seem a lot more durable), with the epic units offering a way to avoid a late game stalemate. Terrain is also important. The game features layered terrain with ramps in a manner similar to Starcraft and lots of other RTS games. It also includes ""brush"": vegetation that units can hide in and look out of. Enemy units cannot see these units unless they enter the brush, which means that the vegetation offers a place to hide from enemy aircraft or to lay an ambush. I haven't seen something like this since Praetorians, a much older RTS set in Roman times where you could hide your troops in forests. It's a great feature that more games should use. The game includes a fifteen-mission campaign, in which you control each of the three factions in turn (Beta, humans, and finally the Goo). There's also DLC available that adds three more missions that fleshes out the story a bit more. Weta Workshop was involved in the design of the game and created the full motion videos -- the look of the game is wonderful and the cinematics are excellent. The tone of the game is great, too; serious, but not grim or dire, and with a certain joy in its execution that makes the game a delight to play. If you get bored with the campaign or want to hone your skills, the game naturally offers a skirmish mode. If you feel inclined to compete against other humans, multiplayer is also available. All in all, Grey Goo offers a complete package and is the best ""traditional"" real-time strategy game to have appeared in a long while (not that it has a lot of competition!), and arguably ranks up there with the best RTS games to have ever appeared. Heartily recommended.			"

												I'll keep it short:Great game! It's like Starcraft(SC) in a new dress, units seems well balanced, campain got some fun elements, abit too short, like 16-18 missions with all 3 races incl. But they seem well balanced and keeps you want to go o the next mission. :^)Graphic is kinda old school, would have been nice if it was better. But still it will do.Love the ""goo"" its a fun idea, kinda like zergs from SC with a new element of blurp in it. :^PThe game is WAY to easy, play it on hard is still not enough to get a real challenge. And the AI is kinda...stupid, like my units will just stand still and take artillery poundings untill they die, they keep pushing each others out of covers and wont always fire at enemy building even when standing right next to the with the elite units...but beside this...its still cool. :^)One of the best alternatives to SC.Multiplayer is where the game is getting strong, if only the community was there! :^)			"

												I don't generally review game, but I have to say because this game is being critiqued unfairly by a fair number of people. This is a ♥♥♥♥ing good game, not great but good. Ok so what I think of the game is clear so lets talk about the bad parts of the game: The campaign is quite short, i beat it in a ten hour strech, and the plot is a bit meh, and the ending was not great. The two ""normal"" races are similar, atlease when compaired to the goo. The music is ok, and gets repetitive quick. The AI can need babysiting, when there are lots of troops and targets most troops don't attack the thing you want them to and get triped up on each other.Now the good, this is one of if not the only old school rts that has been released in years, and I'm not talking about your new school star craft 2, or what ever this is old school. Maps take time and thought to complet and it does not take the reflexes of a cat or the mind of a shut in to play and be good. So if you want not only a rts but a really good one that does look pretty then this is the game for you.			"

												Errmerrgerrd! Old-school RTerrS! Mah Favrit!But seriously. Where has this game been hiding? I thought RTS had died when I saw what EA was doing to the C&C series.  This game says .I.. to that noise.  Classic base-building, ""economy"" management, unit-spamming goodness for your consumption.  Not unlike what you'd expect to see if C&C (1995) and Supreme Commander had a baby.Okay, genre fangasms aside, this game looks solid. I just started and have only done the first campaign mission.  It is exactly what you think it is: tutorials. However, the tutorials are non-invasive (just a pop-up icon you can click to get details about game mechanics), and the pacing goes as fast as you want it to. Generally speaking, the game suffers a few minor nig.gles, mostly UI related, that some people will notice and others likely won't. Example, the camera movements feel a *little* jerky/unsmooth, but not too bad. Also, I want to zoom out moar! View ALL THE THINGS at once! Personal preference though.One thing I was not expecting: the first-class cinematics and the animated character faces in briefings before the missions.  They may not be quite up to the legend of Blizzard cinematic quality, but they do the job *quite* nicely, thank you.  Story is looking interesting as well.I got this game at 60% off, at which it is an amazing value.  If you are a fan of classic RTS, get it even at 50$.  Casual RTS fan? Maybe wait for another sale. Maybe.  If you get your game budget from your mom (I do realize FO4 is coming out soon).			"

It's amazing, really, I didn't even realise how different they all are, and yet, how similar they all are.This game really is amazing.My only qualms are the fact there are only a few skirmish maps and they are not huge-huge maps, but given the type of game, I'm not surprised, it would be too mcuh I think.There is a 200 unit limit, but you'll find this isn't that big of an issue later.I can't find a speed-up limit so farThe campaign is awesome and introduces you to the beta/humans race, I don't know if it lets you play the Goo yet. I suspect it does. It shows you how to build everything without directly telling you; playing it old school.This game was reviewed by Total Biscuit and made me buy this game. No regrets. 9/10			"

												5 hours in;  good time to start a review?  Well I'm hooked;  this RTS has every aspect of C&C plus the new base development system.  It makes the joy of building a base round the original spawning point (taking into account the near-by resource areas, whilst keeping an eye on the open doors (can be secured by towers) to your new home) even more of a joy than it was before.  The engine behaves as you would expect it too with basically the same controls as (the aformentioned) C&C.  But the cut sequences, oh the cut sequences, they are a of a different class. *at the time of writing, the story is also getting quite gripping.  Can't wait to see what's next...			"

												In this time of complete absence of traditional, well-polished RTS titles on the market, Grey Goo feels like a breath of fresh air. Following the classic C&C formula, it offers a welcome distraction from the more fast-paced, micromanagement-oriented games like COH and StarCraft. The campaign is actually pretty good, the story has a feel of a literary sci-fi novel to it. I like the interesting twist in faction design, with the humans being more high-tech and alien than the aliens themselves. The third faction, the Goo, is unlike any faction I've seen in any other RTS, and plays very differently compared to the other two. And of course, it wouldn't be a worthy successor to the C&C franchise if the soundtrack wasn't composed by Frank Klepacki. I definitely recommend this game to any C&C fan out there!			"

												This game is fantastic. Everyone keeps saying it but this is really what RTS is about. The westwood guys have done it again. This is one of the first RTS games that I have truly enjoyed the campaign. Everything in this game feels fresh yet similar in gameplay. Not much else to say. If you like RTS, you will like this.			"

												Great RTS game.You need to play all sides in order to understand that Grey Goo is stronger than other titles.Campaign is weak at the beginning but the last missions are a must. I really like the final cinematic.All units seem not be very different but after some hours of play you know exactly what to use and when. A good point for the game which has it own gameplay.Sadly humans are too weak at expand. I really hope this point will be correct because it stopped me to play the game.I hope that there will be an addon to complete the story or open on a new full game with new factions.			"

Its 15 levels long and u get to play all of the 3 factions if you want a challenge i would play on hard but even on medium some levels will be a challenge.   I Miss these sorts of games its about time someone got a good one out with a good singleplayer mode and not all about mulitplayer and this game does just that but if you like mulitplayer its very good also.

												Grey Goo is an RTS that takes players back to the early days of Command & Conquer.The gameplay is really solid and is sure to b e a challenge. The story is also interesting enough to keep players interested for the length of it. Skirmish is where the game really shines and players have three unique races to play as. If I had to complain about any of the races, it would be the Goo. There's just so much downtime while playing as them that it can get really tedious.Fans of the early C&C games (Red Alert 1&2) should really check this game out.Also, don't let my playtime fool you. I played this a lot when I couldn't connect to Steam. "

												Enjoying it so far. This is the first game and the devs have done a great job . I am a command and conquer and star craft person with a preference for c&c . And I think grey goo is just awesome , the base building is fresh but familiar and there is a nice tech tree, you can build walls .... yaaaaay ... also the super units are pretty cool too. The cut scenes are what I would expect from a first generation RTS and are pretty decent but not quite AAA. I am 3 or 4 missions into the campaign mission and I dont really enjoy multiplayer vs humans so this has been great for me. I will check out the multiplayer and update this if it all starts to go bad but I can't see that happening, hopefully there is a 2 v2 human vs ai as i like to co-op with starcraft against the AI and would really like to do that with grey good after I finish the campaign.  This is a great RTS and if you like C&C then I reckon you will  definitely enjoy this. BUY !			"

												This game was recommended to me by a friend at release and I support the recommendation. I enjoyed the learning curve which was not bad in terms of units but took me some time adjusting to the economy and pace. Pros+Pace is neither long winded nor over before you know it. The game regulates this with simple unit cap and depleting resources. Tech progress is more about choosing a strategy than waiting to get up to it.+Graphics are appropriately pretty without bogging me down.+ Factions are distinct and balanced well enough from my non-competitive viewpoint.+Controls are intuitive and the game is generally not super micromanage heavy.+ Premade maps are diverse and well made for their purposes. +Building a counter force is doableCons-Build order. You must have the basics taking up extremely limited space at all times because replacing them with upgraded versions will prevent all construction. I just want to ditch my little factory for a big one when the map won't let me put down a hub since there are mountains in the way. But if I do that I need to find someplace to stick a little factory otherwise I am not allowed to build anything at all.-Economy is feast or famine. Early game is just waiting for the first gatherer to finish then wait for the little drones to bring it back. It's a very boring two minutes that can only go two ways. More early variety would be nice. Then if you have enough resources it doesn't really matter since the cap prevents using them. Only one resource is also a bit boring imo. -Upgrades are available to choose from pretty early on. You only need to pick the one that corresponds to the unit or two you are using. That's it. Nothing really to work up to, If you want to play with tanks then you build a tank attachemnt and select tank upgrade. End of story no progresssion arc.-Epic units are not diverse. Each faction gets one and it's not that powerful. -AI could use some tweaks, they tend to not use the map to its advantage. All in all I think it's a good game that is catered towards shorter matches whereas I want a war not a skirmish.			"

												Interesting concepts that I have never before seen in an RTS. I have played a lot of them. Very enjoyable. The tech tree is especially interesting. Since picking a tech denies two others. So you have to plan ahead when picking your technology, using it to counter your opponent. The tech may be re-specced during the game, but takes three minutes to do. Play it your way.			"

												The Game doesn't try to be a C&C Clone or to be as deep in strategy as Earth 2160.Basicly there are 3 different Factions with, a round 12 different Units on each side, some Buildings and thats it.Some Units of the BETA can mount a wall, to make a relativ strong defense, The Humans can teleport buildings and Units and the Goo... well they play very different and remind me really to the aliens of Earth 2160, from a certain point of view.Waht I want to say is, that  exept the described abilities, there are no special abilities wich you can activate, like in C&C ior Earth 2160, which makes one thinking the game would missing content, and somehow I think that too, but for example chess has also just a few different units, movement rules but no special abilities, but no one would say it would lack in content or its strategies are easy.I like  Grey Goo, and think with what we have here, it is still possible to have a certain depth in strategy and tactic.But a lot more Content and maybe even game mechenics, would't be bad.SOMETHING which I realy miss is a levelsystem, which would make the Game so or so better and would give some Units more Value.One Game which I like also is Mashines at War 3, which also has a nice simple levelsystem or Earth 2160Pros:- Good Graphic and Ingame Videos- Rock,cissor, paper principe and Line of sight, Hights advantage- Sound is good- Factions are different which means at least 3 Strategic aproaches- Nice Campaign- Relative Balanced- Super UnitsCons:- No Unit Levels ( like in C&C etc.)- Not so much Content ( Its my personel meaning) I would buy it on discounts, like I did a few weeks ago, during wintersale.I hope I could help some people to consider a purchase.

												This is a great real-time strategy game, developed by some of the original team behind the Command & Conquer games, and it shows. Grey Goo features a similar resource system as the C&C games (a flow economy), but does away with the need to build power plants to generate energy. The latter move has been called into question in some corners and it does remove some of the nuance in the base-building aspect, but the game works fine without it. Grey Goo is named after the eponymous Goo faction, which consist of nano machines. They are a roving faction that don't need structures to create new units. Instead, park your main unit -- the Mother Goo -- on top of a catalyst (i.e. main resource) vent and, once the Mother Goo has grown to a sufficient size, split it in two to generate another Mother Goo or a prothean (which can be split into actual units). The Goo are one of the most interesting factions to come along in an RTS game in a long while and offer a different kind of challenge regardless of whether you're controlling them or fighting against them. The other two factions are also interesting. The humans are the most technologically advanced faction in the game, which makes for quite a nice change from most other games where humans are presented as the underdog. They field hover tanks and build bases using a system of conduits. They are ideals for those players who wish to turtle up. They can teleport structures and units around, which gives them a flexability that offsets the rigidity that building a human base initially seems to bring with it. The last faction are the Beta (the name that the humans have given them, actually). These are aliens and perhaps the most traditional of the factions in the game. You build hubs of various sizes and attach other modules to them, such as factories. They are the only faction in the game to field any type of infantry. Most of their units consist of vaguely dinosaur-shaped mechs, which give them a character all of their own. Like the humans, they are able to erect walls. This means that they can turtle up like the humans, but are also more flexible thanks to using hubs as the centre of their bases. Each of the factions also fields a single ""epic"" unit: the magnificent and deadly purger for the Goo, the Alpha for the humans (essentially a giant, floating robot with a human inside), and the Hand of Ruk (a flying fortress) for the Beta. Each faction also has five tech slots: you have to pick from three techs for every slot and they essentially serve as bonuses. The system is simple, but it works great. One of the things that the developers specifically set out to do is create an accessible RTS that emphasizes strategy over tactics. As a result, all units do one thing and one thing only. They don't have any special abilities that you need to worry about. Just create groups and focus on the bigger picture. Units move more slowly than, for example, in Command & Conquer and they are also a bit more durable (the structures seem a lot more durable), with the epic units offering a way to avoid a late game stalemate. Terrain is also important. The game features layered terrain with ramps in a manner similar to Starcraft and lots of other RTS games. It also includes ""brush"": vegetation that units can hide in and look out of. Enemy units cannot see these units unless they enter the brush, which means that the vegetation offers a place to hide from enemy aircraft or to lay an ambush. I haven't seen something like this since Praetorians, a much older RTS set in Roman times where you could hide your troops in forests. It's a great feature that more games should use. The game includes a fifteen-mission campaign, in which you control each of the three factions in turn (Beta, humans, and finally the Goo). There's also DLC available that adds three more missions that fleshes out the story a bit more. Weta Workshop was involved in the design of the game and created the full motion videos -- the look of the game is wonderful and the cinematics are excellent. The tone of the game is great, too; serious, but not grim or dire, and with a certain joy in its execution that makes the game a delight to play. If you get bored with the campaign or want to hone your skills, the game naturally offers a skirmish mode. If you feel inclined to compete against other humans, multiplayer is also available. All in all, Grey Goo offers a complete package and is the best ""traditional"" real-time strategy game to have appeared in a long while (not that it has a lot of competition!), and arguably ranks up there with the best RTS games to have ever appeared. Heartily recommended.			"

												A game that reminds me an awful lot like C&C. There are 3 seperate factions with completely different play styles. Humans play a more defence play, Beta play an offensive play and the Goo are very different in respect to anything I have played before. This game is all about that early game and knowing what your enemy is doing. Building a billion of one unit doesn't work like it did in C&C and so you must build counters. Overall I really enjoy this game and I would reccomend andyone to pick this game up on sale.			"
