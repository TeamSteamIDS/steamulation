												Now here is a MOBA game that never got the credit it deserved. Demigod popped on my radar a few years back but when it launched there were several server issues that hindered the initial launch. I still praise this game because when the dust settled and the mud slinging stopped it turned out to be a pretty little gem. Demigod borrows interesting ideas from RTS games and implements that into MOBA gameplay. Capturing points, upgrading troops, towers and buildings are just a few of these mechanics and I welcome them as a different way of looking at how  MOBA games could add layers of gameplay. Unfortunately there was nothing else added to the game with the exception of two extra demigods. Each demigod is unique and you still level up, gain gold, upgrade skills and buy items.I've had some incredible matches on Demigod when the community remained active and it is something I always go back to with a few friends for bot matches. The AI matches can get incredibly hectic on the higher difficulties with Demigod offering a variety of maps. You can pick up Demigod now for $10 but I've seen it for around $5 on the sales.  "

												Best MOBA I've seen so far. It's got everything and actually requires you to think your next move and also empowers you as player to contribute to victory other than ""win teamfight -> game over"" base destroyed before enemy respawns back. Some players in your team can push lanes, others can capture towers, others can upgrade your own towers or units or citadel or even spawn multiple types of minions/archers/balistas/angels/giants etc. You could go capture some mines or that all round wanted +20% Experience Flag or the infamous +15% HP and EVEN upgrade yourself with multiple spawn-able units that you directly control yourself and that can be purchased from the shop. There's a lot of diversity in maps as there are many of them and unlike other mobas this one actually has mods! You know things that upgrade your UI, bot AI, Extra items etc.I'm having a blast playing this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes MOBA games because it is unique in this genre.			"

												This game is really well designed and has very high production values. All around a well polished game with great graphics and soundtrack. For instance, the opening movie sequence was voiced by the actor, Christopher Lee, known for his roles as Dracula and the evil wizard, Sauron, in Lord of the Rings.The initial learning curve is a little steep without strong tutorial missions, but persistent players will be rewarded with hours of fun. I recommend playing against the computer bots on easy mode, and if possible, get a friend to play co-op with you against the bots. You won't be disappointed.Demigod is something of a sleeper hit that may have been overshadowed by the likes of League of Legends (LOL) and Defense of the Ancients (DOTA 1 and DOTA 2). However, this game is just so cool when you have a friend to play with.Keg gives Demigod four thumbs up!			"

												This game is like League of Legends, DOTA 2, Heroes of the Storm and nothing like them. It has a slow, deliberate gameplay where you always have the option of running away, but seldom do. This often gives the feeling of tactics more than a click-fest. You could have given up the defense and backed off, but you took a stand and won (or died heroically).There are only 10 heroes, but it is impossible to buy all abilities of a demigod during one match. The item list is a bit short, split between equipment (~6x6 low to medium-powered  items) and artifacts (~12 late-stage heavy hitters). The heroes are all rendered as high-quality models, and the maps are plentiful. Add in the 4 different victory conditions and matches can be very different.I like the feeling of control and the well thought-out hero concepts. I mean, one of the demigods is a giant walking fortress that shoots arrows, catapults and magic tower blasts, slotting into the defense grid :).			"

												Demigod is one of those games which surprised the hell out of me in many ways. From the overall presentation, the graphics and audio and the very fun and addictive gameplay, Demigod is one of the best mixed genre games and a shining example of how great game developers can continue to evolve old ideas into bigger and better games. For players looking for some challenging strategy with an RPG skill system that allows the player to tailor the game to their play style, will find a fun and affordable game with Demigod.Demigod is one of those games which are focused for a restricted community. The game is strategy, but it’s also a role-playing and an action game, and every genre it tries its well executed, offering a deep and engaging on-line gameplay. Not traditional at all, and surprisingly intense.Just make sure you understand what kind of game you are buying and you won't be disappointed.			"

												I tried LOL at one point and I'm in the Heroes of the Storm Alpha but I just wasn't very good or had any idea what I was doing with these MOBA style games. Then my friend introduced me to this one and it was awesome. After the first battle I had a great grasp on what I was doing and pretty much stomped face for our remaining games. The graphics are nice, the characters are diverse and each one plays differently.My favorite thing are the levels.They are all very different. Instead of the same map with the same things just moved around in different spots, each arena is a new setting, the layout is different along with the placement of the various buildings, flags, and portals, and the ambient surroundings are somethign as well. It's a nice change. It forces you to rethink your path, strategy somewhat for each arena you play on.If you like League and Dota and other MOBA games, definitely get this one... and then play it with me!			"

												I love this game. I eternally love, love.. LOVE this game.I can replay it over and over and over again, as if I'm searching for something new but never find it.  Which brings me to why I hate this game. I hate this game so much for making me want more of this game.Fantastic artwork, a storyline that you can pretty much sense just through some of the battle dialogue, the ability to constantly adjust the camera angles because I forget what game I'm playing and think that I'm strafing- instead, I disorient myself and forget where I am. I know that there are newer, updated games out there, and I know it had a rough start, but it's one of those simple games you can keep going back to with your friends or do some tournaments on your own and pretend that you have friends. (Clearly, I choose to do the latter.).. I really need friends. So I can buy them the 4-pack and make them pretend to be my pixelated friends.(I love this game.)			"

												A game that was so far ahead of its time that others are still trying to catch up. Beautiful graphics that still surpass any other MOBA out. Nice sound track and great sound effects. With a surround system the battles pound.(When Rook starts swinging his hammer, you feel it.) Not to mention, Christopher Lee as the narrator!There is a small (and seemingly growing} group of players on this one. Join the community forums to find players that really enjoy it. Also there is a mod pack that absolutely crucial for this game, again see the steam community forums for details of where to get it. (http://forums.demigodthegame.com/412017)I have had this one for a while and I love that it came out in 2009 and I am still having so much fun with it. With the mod pack(which fixes some AI issues) the game provides an amazing single player experience and with a full roster in multiplayer the game owns. Inspite of Dota's massively superior numbers and the full weight of Valve's marketing, Demigod eats Dota's lunch. (Also, please note that I bought the Box version on release- then got the Steam version when it became available.  Only mention it because the Steam hours played listed are not accurate of my play time with this one.)Be advised though, you should consider this as a ""Single Player"" purchase. Do that and you will enjoy the ride.			"

												Short version: If you have ANY desire to play a MOBA that was ahead of its time. Get this.Long-ish textwally version: This game was the BEST way back in the day when there was a somewhat lively community, it's died down quite a lot since, but still decent. The gameplay was, and to me, still is, slightly is ahead of the MOBA curve in it's own way, such as being able to upgrade your main citadel to buff your creep waves and the like.  Now due to it's age, theres many a bug, my personal favorite being random times where your character won't bloody move when told, but that's pretty minor and rare. Another thing I love is the fact that, while certain God's are more suited to certain roles, there is no ""Best"" build for every situation for a given character. Speaking of God's, quite a bit of diversity, you've got anywhere from the fragile archer angel, Regulus, to the literal walking castle Rook. The gods are split into two types: Assassins and General's, Assassins just worry about themselves, whereas General are capable of summoning various creatures, either through abilities or items.While there are admittedly only 10 gods, and all there ever will be as far as we can tell, well, outside of mods of course, but they all have a huge amount of thought and love put into their designs and back story. There are about 8 maps, and 4 modes, so it may repeat a bit... In hindsight I realize this was just me gushing over the game, but still, if that doesn't make you interested, dunno what will, 9.5/10			"

												Demigod is a DOTA-like game that while providing a generally pleasing take on the genre fails to provide a complete experience and a number of game breaking issues means that most players will never truly enjoy it.Demigod is a mix of strategy and role playing action, you pick from a list of demigods, either strong damage dealing assassins or minion summoning generals each with a unique set of skills and then do battle on a large arena as a team against another team of either human or AI controlled deities. As you kill enemies and do battle you earn currency and experience allowing you to level your demigod up through a branching skill-tree as well as purchase a variety of upgrades at your homebase, anything from stat boosting wearables to potions and massive faction boosts are available. At the end of a match all is reset and you get to do it all over again against a new foe or controlling a new hero.Demigod makes a number of rookie mistakes however. The lack of any sort of tutorial makes the game difficult to learn and the single-player matches against the AI does in no way prepare you for the multi-player. As a heavily team dependent game it is quite possible for a single inexperienced player to lose the match regardless of his teammates leading to a generally hostile community.The greatest mistake Demigod makes however, is in the multi-player. Connection issues plague every matchup and it requires an enormous amount of patience to play a full game. For a game that is so heavily multi-player based this should be a complete deal breaker for any potential buyers.The game is fairly good looking and the sound and music is pleasant enough creating an enjoyable atmosphere.All in all Demigod is a decent MOBA that provides you with a unique set of Generals and Assassins to control and has all the makings of an enjoyable game. The lack of single-player components and the massive connection issues makes me unable to recommend this to anyone however as even the most avid MOBA aficionado will be hard pressed to enjoy a game he cannot play.

												For being marketed as ""the first commercial MOBA"" it's not half bad for being as half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as it is. You're right, it is pretty dynamic, not as challenging to pick up as Dota, and gives you some basic flexibility with your auto-throwaway units, which you can upgrade (along with towers) at your citadel. Despite there being only ten heroes, there's more gameplay options with the ""generals"" (spawn your own minions) or ""assassin"" (nuker) hero class categories.*sighs*That said, the game received no patches or additional content post-release. Even at release, there were very, very few maps with no tutorial or story campaign. So, basically, you jump right in with NPC fights or buggy, laggy online games (which, as you might imagine, do not exist) with the same limited map pool. While the game had the capacity for mod content, it's not like the Steak Workshop or Creator Kit was around when this came out, so there is no amateur content either to be found either unless you want some very basic UI tweaks.I think, probably, the most aggravating part of this game is that what few maps there are don't really allow for progress like Dota does with one map. It's like Unreal Tournament (2004), if you create a game with just AI players, you can stay at your base for five hours if you wanted to, come back, everything is exactly how it was when you left it. Heroes do not have as significant presence/impact without reaching the maximum level. The gameplay is just...bland. There's no hiding, very limited potential for ganking, no terrain advantages/disadvantages, hidden items...No meaningful progress happens on the map without steamrolling with sheer numbers and, even then, that progress is easily reversed back to a stalemate automatically by creeps in no time flat. Die, kill me, anything. Games HAVE to end at some point.Whereas some really good older titles were given new patches and content by their publishers  to bring them back to being contenders with Steam re-releases, this was an already mediocre game that did not get that attention.This is just the absolute embodiment of lost potential.

												I've had this game in my library for some months now... But just recently started playing it. I did not expect this game to be that good! This is like a slower, but more strategy demanding game than more modern MOBA titles. You basically have to maintain control over certain points of interest to win the game. Haven't played singleplayer modes. POSITIVE:- Beautiful Design of characters and maps. - Versatile gameplay styles depending on the map and Demigod you have chosen to play. - Its a ton of fun for playing between friends. NEGATIVE: - Lack of online community. - No tutorial. - The Game crashed the first time I ran it on W10. But after a simple restart, the game functioned normally. I would expect more of these errors occur, but nothing too serious. Note: Multiplayer skirmish games can last over an hour. I recommend buying this game with a bunch of friends.			"

												This game is highly under rated. They should have kept updating it with new characters. I know it would be a popular game today if they did. I was big into Dota 2 when i got this but i was always going back to it. Or Dota might have just been taking off. I got this on release and lost it with Stardock teaming up with Gamestop or something. I couldnt get my game or login anywhere to get it. I just bought this again off Steam. Guess what happened when i tried to install it. Stardock magicly found my old game and account and i couldnt make a new one for the new game. So i bought it for nothing. Something would be at least one person playing online. I rarely got anyone online even on release. Pantheon the best mode i never got anyone ever. This game is different enough to other mobas that it can be played along side them. Best zoom camera around. Plenty of atmosphere. I just wish the pvp was more popular. I also expected tons of great mods for this game when i got it on release but as far as i know there's none or very few. Its like a large scale moba with no always online and bots if you have no friends or cant find anyone online. Everone who likes mobas should have this.			"

												I REALLY wish i could tell you that Demigod is a great game, but the game was doomed since it's launch.To explain things, Demigod has some unique characters that are fun to play, and the game offers some strategy mechanics to players who are more comfortable with RTS games than MOBAs, i could easily tell you that this is the easiest moba out here, and that Demigod is a curious blend of all these mechanics in an epic warhammer-esque way.THIS IS WHERE THE♥♥♥♥♥♥HITS THE FANThe game has got NO UPDATES SINCE RELEASE, meaning it's incredibly buggy and unbalanced at some point (assasin demigods are WAY more powerful than their general counterpart). Also a few years back (around it's release) pirates hacked the server service for the game, stardock, said pirates had acess to all the user's information, some of which includes credit card data.  Gas powered and Stardock didn't do♥♥♥♥♥♥about it and decided to abandon the game.  In other words: no online multiplayer unless you use third party software, and usually people who use these on demigod are hacking.This game would've got an easy 8/10 if it wasn't for the developpers losing interest in the game, this could've been a competitor to league of legends, but then again they used an extremely old internet service for their game (stardock was already known to suck, the reason why they were chosen is because of budgetary reasons).And no, the single player mode doesn't save this game: no campaign, no backstory, nada.  Single player is basically a ""play against AI"" mode, in which the AI is absolutely horrible and will get easily destroyed by anyone who auto-attacks them.this gets a 3/10 for me, i really hate to say this, but you ♥♥♥♥ed up Gas Powered.

												First off, let me state that when Demigod was released, it's multiplayer was pretty much broken due to the publisher insisting on doing the netcode and sucking at it hardcore. This issue has since been resolved, and is no longer an issue; the multiplayer works just fine now, no real problems.Now, from there, let's get into a few aspects of the game itself:Demigod is a MOBA style game, where you play as a single hero/champion/demigod/whatever style character who starts off kinda flimsy, and gradually levels up, fighting large armies of enemy units with the goal of defeating the enemy team. Thing LoL, HoN, DotA, Smite, Dawngate and so on.Where Demigod leaves the rest of the pack, is that it focuses very heavily upon a small number of highly customizable and remarkably in depth characters, rather than a large number of half-done characters which is par for the course for the rest of the genre. Yes, everyone loves pudge and mundo, but they really simply aren't on par with pretty much anything in Demigod, and the Rook is just kind of a game ender in that contest =PThe next part where Demigod leaves traditional MOBA-style gameplay behind, is it focuses very heavily upon strategic assets and tactical control; holding onto flags is a game-changer, and you can upgrade or add to your army, with a remarkably large wealth of global upgrades for your whole team and even your minions.You heard me right; other mobas rely on the concept of both sides having equal minions for the most part, a perpetual stalemate where the players are the only force that changes the tide of war, and minions are simply an exp/gold payday. In Demigod, however, you can capture the portals from an enemy that spawns their minions, upgrade your own minions, or even purchase new minions to be added to waves, such as healers or catapultasauri (yes, catapult dinosaurs, epix win, I know).Another major part about Demigod is that the only gold comes from passive gold gain, and from killing Demigods/towers. How does this work? Well, mines are strategically set up around the map, and these can be captured to steal the gold away from the enemy team. Think Dawngate, but significantly more potent to hold onto more mines and territory, but harder to keep the strategic parts long term.Yet another neat feature are items which can be purchased from points earned in any game, wherein these points last perpetually between games. Once you buy one of these special items, you can dump it onto your demigod at the start of a new round for free... but you only get one out of a list of about 20. It's an interesting feature, to say the least.Again, we have another major feature that changes Demigod from all of it's competitors... virtually every single other MOBA out there has your character max all their skills out at maximum level. In Demigod, you instead get a much larger skill-tree (think closer to diablo-2), and will have to pick and choose which abilities to level over time. In this manner, the same character can play very differently from one match to the next... in one match, Sedna may be a general carrying around an army of minions and aura items, spamming heals out; in the next match, she might be a remarkably high-speed assassin with strong burst and self healing/regeneration. As such, your character choice has a significant impact upon the game, but you have a lot more leeway after character select than in most other MOBAs which can often be decided simply based on team composition.The last major part about Demigod which sets it apart from the crowd, is it actually has a wealth of options for adjusting the game's difficulty and gameplay for each game played, and a remarkably robust AI. Co-op in Demigod is still farther along than even League of Legends, and most other MOBAs don't even have a co-op mode at all.End verdict:Demigod fails in a few minor ways, but not by a lot. Some of it's strengths make it a good game, but not a good MOBA for serious pro-level PvP. It's well worth the money for what it is, however, and it's probably the single best MOBA-style option out there for people who want to play co-op with their friends rather than PvP. Is it the best MOBA out there? No, but it's definitely one of the better ones and well worth looking into. Just keep in mind that the multiplayer community is kind of dead these days, so bring your own friends.Overall, it deserves a good 75-85%, with variation for personal taste and whether you have friends to play with or not.

												I regret the times, when I couldn't play this game in it's prime, when tournaments were alive. But I don't regret buying  digital copy now.Back in 2008, when I read about the game, DotA Allstars was already a thing you need to be aware of if you play games. And I was indeed aware. I tried the thing and got bored pretty quickly. Something was amiss. Something didn't want me to enjoy the game, and I felt out of place, when I heard praise about this new exciting genre like MOBA.When I read about Demigod I got a little flame of hope lit up in me. Everything from background of characters to the name of the game and a little story behind already was to my liking. But would the gameplay keep up with that? I wasn't sure.Back in a day, when that game came out I hadn't good internet connection, but I could play via LAN, so we had the game on our rigs. And we had a blast of it.You know the feeling, when you play a game, that let's you dissolve into the process, to feel zen. That's one of that kind of games for me. What DotA couldn't possibly achieve (cause of this is unknown) Demigod did for me.My friends are trying to convey through words why they like it more than other MOBAs, but I think it's not possible. For me there's no actual reason (or list of them) I can name to describe why I'm never bored or never annoyed by Demigod.Some say that the thing is in variation, or quality, or balance, or in quantity of content. I'd say none of it matters, yet everything in this mosaic of attributes just needs to be alligned with your feeling of what's right.If you're ever wondering, whether should you buy it or not - first make sure you have friends to play with. Then consider your wallet. And lastly take a chance if you will. And maybe you will become one of us, the Demigods.			"

												I've been told this is very similar to League of Legends and Dota and various other things, though I haven't played the former. However I can say that I have played Dota 2 and find it incredily difficult to understand what is going on especially with the lack of a half-deent tutorial.Onto Demigod - This game for me is the perfect starting point into this genre, if you find the aformentionned games have too much of a learning curve. I have to say I enjoy this game very much, it's reasonably fast-paced, though you may wish to take a bit of time to get to know your favourite character and the various items/upgrades that are in the game (which are easy to access and understand, unlike dota with it's various item 'trees'. The Environments are beautifully realised in scale and really work well with the 'story' or if you like the 'setting' of the game being that various Demigods are battling it out and the victor will become a God and rule over the others. The way the environments are designed resemble a form of game 'board' like Chess or Labyrinth which just works well especially with symmetry that is involved. Even if you are not a fan of this genre, I would recommend this game based on its reasonable learning curve, visuals and soundtrack along with playability. An all-round great experience.			"

												Not exactly like the mainstream mobas , mainly because of your direct involvement in your tem's victory. I would give this one a 7/10 , mainly because of lack of items. You can make a truly unique hero despite of a small roster , and contribute in your team's victory in various ways. That being said , items sadly lack diversity , and you will find yourself reapeating one and the same build throughout the game. About the actual gameplay , as said before , you contribute to your team's victory in more than one way , capturing checkpoints to spawn additional minions , or instead of investing gold on yourself , you can invest it in upgrades for your own team , from purchasing smaller death penalties to upgrading minions , and a lot more. To summarize , although it is truly fun for a while , it eventualy bores out , since there isnt enough replayable content.			"

												Dont pay any attention to the number of hours I have played it on steam.  I have owned this game from the first time it came out.  And I have hundreds of hours on this game.This is one game that does not get the respect it deserves.  It is a complicated MOBA and it requires you to think on how your strategy is to be played out.  And it is not as fast as games like DOTA2, so it gives you a little time to think (not much though).It is not a MOBA like Dota games.  In this game you do not destroy towers, except for the citadel which will end the game.  In Demigod you control flags and each flag has different buffs and the control of the object they are near.  (I.E. Portals,)  When you control a flag that is next to a portal you team gets that portal and the minions that come out of that portal belong to your team as long as you control the flag.  Plus there are character upgrades and Citadel upgrades and you can buy artifacts from the store or a special store that requires the capture of a flag.  Also there are artifact upgrades that you can purchase with Favor points that stay with you from game to game.  And the characters have a lot of spells that completely identify to their character type.Pretty much everyone agrees that the graphics and animation is stunning, and they are.  And for a 2009 game they hold up to any game.  And the strategy is deep and you will learn to hate your friends all over again.  This game is brutal and non-forgiving.The main complaints from people are1.	No tutorial.  And it doesn’t.  This was a bad mistake by GPG.  The game does have a strong learning curve.  This causes people not to understand the game, and go on to something else.2.	The internet lobby is bad. And it is.  The Internet Lobby is limited.But my friends mostly play among ourselves.  It works over internet and Local LAN Hosting. For me it is good to have a MOBA that is not like DOTA, Not that I have complaints about DOTA and I also play DOTA2,  but there are just so many DOTA like games out there.  And most of them seem to have the same map, and the interfaces seem to close to the same. If not an outright copy.			"

												Even though I have only played this alone, I like this game. I wanted it when it was on the shelves of the big box store and it drew me back into Steam and playing on PC. Even though at times it does not seem to make a difference as to the effort you put into your skill tree or trying to take a strategic point over and over, it does beg the question if the gameplay is different against humans rather than AI (and I'll admit to not reading any documentation if there is any). The premise is simple in that you grab your legion, secure some portals and wipe out the opponents ""base"". And while doing so, set up defensive structures and level up your DemiGod. But still, it is an interesting arena style game, with legions at your bidding and lots of eye candy in the creature models.			"

												Top down tower defense game with unique map layout. Very basic tower defense game (TDG) that has single player ""skirmish"" and multiplayer modes, from 1 vs. 1 to 5 vs. 5 players.It feels like it wasn't meant to be a full online / multiplayer experience like other TD games. Game didn't get popular enough to compete with League of Legends, Heroes of Newearth and other tower defense games. Has unique maps, not your average ""creeps run in line to enemy base"" layout. Limited number of ""Heroes"", your basic melee and ranged types, nukers, tanks and supports.Character design is good with great abilities, animation, model quality and textures. Environment quality is really basic, not a lot of detail, mostly stone, concrete grey surfaces, with magic and arrow towers. Maps are located in ""space"", looks like you're battling in ""divine heights"" after all. There are different places on maps that you can capture, some add gold income, some increase creep health and damage, others boost your health / mana regeneration, etc.You can buy items for head, chest, belt, boots, gloves, accessory slots as well as buy special ""Hero summonable creeps"" - ranged, melee and healer types, that you can control and resummon if killed through the match. Killing creeps, enemy heroes and capturing objectives on map grant you experience, thus you level up. Maximum level is 20, and each time you level you can spend points to upgrade your HERO ""1234 aka QWER"" abilities or upgrade the BASE skills (creep health, add unique creeps to waves, etc.).Game doesn't feel like your typical TDG, and is somewhat unique. Downside is that not many people play multiplayer, and there's not much diversity to keep you going for long time. Game itself is a short and basic TD experience, that I personally enjoyed playing.

												Great game I enjoy the Uniqueness of each Demigod and I really wish people still play it online. I understand when the game was first realeased it was a complete mess and the netcode was messed up so no one could play online. Though I doubt it I really hope people will start to realize this game is alot of fun and will start to atleast get a small fan cult playing it			"

												now one of my favourite RTS. a great classic that keeps you captivated the entire round. the down side is that the online matchmaking is one of the worst. fun to play against the A.I. or possibly friends in a private match. its an extremely underrated game. definatly recomend buying it. hoping for a sequal with bettering online.

												Not as popular as DOTA, HoN, LoL but is better and more immersive than all three of them in terms of the levelling up and skills system. There are only 10 'heroes' to choose from, but each are as different as they can be. Stunning graphics, exciting gameplay and chaotic skirmishes make this game worth it even though sadly, no one really plays it anymore.			"

												A true shame here. I bought this on Stardock's dead Impulse client and they were kind enough to send me steam keys for this and my other games. This game is worthless without an online community, which has been nonexistant for many years. Never a single player online. This is a perfect case of what lack of promotion will lead to. This is one of the best DOTA clones in my opinion. It brought new ideas, is very pretty, sounds fantastic. Great production all around. It deserved better success. But as of now, it should not be purchased. I expect Sins of a Solar Empire will have a similar review from me...			"

												One of the most underrated MOBA, this game is better than any LoL or DotA ripoff. It was actually released before those two and really pushed the MOBA genre. It's sad that it didn't get as many attention as it shoudlve had, leading to the an early abandonment of the game by the devs. I got to say though that even with only 10 heroes, this game feel fresh and very diversed. Needless to say that this is the best looking MOBA, even after all those years. I'd recommend this game to anyone who want to take a little break from the big two (LoL and DotA2). It's worth the money!			"

												It removes one of the worst conventions of MOBAs, last-hitting, but provides such a bare-bones experience that it will only entertain you for a short time before you've seen all there is to see. Worse still, Stardock has labeled the project a failure, and there will be no more work done on the game. If you want to play a MOBA, but you hate last-hitting, try Heroes of the Storm. I hear it is more of a Hero brawler, and less of a MOBA, but it is probably a better use of your money.I'll admit I enjoyed the game, when I still felt motivated to play it, and I got it for a whole $2, so I suppose I got a good value. However, I also got Sacred Gold (on gog.com, mind) for the same price, and will continue to get value out of that that will far exceed this title, just to put things in perspective.			"

												When I was little, this game looked like the♥♥♥♥♥♥and I was so excited to play it, but my parents never let me get it or had a computer that could run it. However, when I grew up and remembered this game, I quickly realized that this game was definitely not the♥♥♥♥♥♥ It just lacks in variety, and the combat feels clunky and slow-paced. It's not a bad game and it's fun to play, but it's not doto or lol. However, I lost a lot of respect for the devs of Demigod when I learned about their attitude in some media they published, idr if it was an interview or what. But basically, the devs were like ""we're going to beat those guys at league of legends, our game is better, it has more potential"", and then when they failed, they blamed it on logistic issues at launch and etc. I mean, cmon, league is huge and very well polished as a game, and Demigod is not much more than an amateur game. Nevertheless, the devs did do a pretty good job with the game as it is, and it is quite fun to play once in a while. P.S. I had a huge crush on queen of thorns when I was going through puberty. After puberty I realized that I was a fool.			"

												Even on sale this game is an unfortunate waste of money. No online community and its a MOBA, so you get single player or you can play with friends. This was true last year as well as today. It is def a fun moba, maybe if they made it free and changed the pay style to match that of DOTA or LOL they could revive it, but that means they would have to support it again and I'm sure the devs have moved on lol.Dont buy this game expecting to play online multiplayer unless you have specific friends who want to play with you.

												My first MOBA that I had ever played and the first and only one I loved until I got my hands on Heroes of the Storm  (HOTS) Closed Beta. Compared to HOTS, Demigod can't really be compared because it plays so differently than HOTS and many other MOBAs. Its characters are so diverse, in my opinion (imo), that character fatigue is highly unlikely. Each chnaracter clearly has different strategies they use and can be modified to fit the players style or the shifting nature of battle.The graphics are still as good as I remember them and the fact that its still really good, IMO, compared to many of the current generation of games really impresses me.The gameplay is very skill based and requires a good amount of play time to really master, which I haven't.The audio is the only part I say is dated but the fact that I still enjoy listening to the hero speak as I battle is really nice and brought back a lot of my past times playing the game.Over all this is a game that I would be more than willing to keep playing even if I have to get my own personally owned server to play it, which most likely won't happen, this is due to the games only true issue, imo, the weak servers for multiplayer.

												I remember this back when it first came out, was supposed to be a ""League of Legends"" killerUnfortunatly they didnt realize how insanly popular LoL would become, thus totally dwarfing this game completly and throwing it into the corner of obscurity.This game was Gifted to me by a friend and I have to say its a fun game for that style of gameplay.   This game however lacks characters... there are only two types... Tank/Healers and Assassin/Carry's.  That is coupled with the fact there are only 8 choosable characters to play (+2 grey'ed out unchoosables... a DLC that didnt happen?)  making gameplay a tad repetitive in the long run.If you decide to pick this game up though be warned, there is no Online community for it anymore... pick it up knowing you will only be playing A.I. Bots solobut for 2.50 (the sale price) its totally worth it as a great casual hour killing game.if you want to play this style of game Seriously though pick up League of Legends or DoTA2 (they are both free) they have huge communities and ""MLG"" tournaments7/10			"

AI is relatively fun to play against though, even if it's just one of those games that defines ""difficulty"" as just ""how much the AI cheats"".Not recommended at full price, but worth considering at 50%+ off.

(played it for 20 mins and I got more than 60k gold. items are relatively expensive too.)- uncomfortable camera POV- heroes take control of minions (which is quite original)- takes time to get familiar with HUD- every interaction I make seem to be delayed for ~0.5 secs, and I was doing single playnot bad. worth giving a try if you're MOBA or AOS enthusiasts, but the whole multiplayer sessions seem to died out.6/10 "

												A damn good MOBA, that it practially doesn't fit the genre. Better and much more balanced than any of those other games in the genre. The only real hurdle you have to jump over, is memorizing all the items available to you in game, as you certainly don't have time to be perusing through the whole selection while the battle is being fought.10 / 12Made by the creators of Dungeon Siege and Supreme Commander. High quality games from great devs!			"

												Once you play this on hard mode it is STUPID ♥♥♥♥ING RIDICULOUSLY HARD. Any other demigod you play against will suddenly magically be invincible. Renders the game beyond irritating.Sedna? For real? Once demigods have their healers it renders the game moot.

												Remember when Chris Taylor's name attached to something was a positive, and not a kiss of death? Well if you played Demigod you got to experience the exact turning point in that relationship with the world.Although maybe Space Siege was worse/first. I always forget that one.Anyway Demigod is what happens if you take a LoMa game and slice off features, polish, roster, and anything even remotely charming from it and then ship it in a Gearbox-like cloud of hype that never materializes or is outright fabrication. Don't buy this, I'm unable to get a single ♥♥♥♥ing game of this going and this genre is on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rise/the game costs $1 right now.			"

												I've played League of Legends, DOTA 2 and Demigod. I didn't realize that demi-god was simliar till these games till I first loaded it up. I thought it was just a unique RTS game.  I wish it would've been. The gameplay is fairly dull with several characters standing out as much more powerful than others.  I used one character to outrange an enemies tower and minions and harass them until I got the gold I needed to just destroy them. There's a good mix of character abilities but they are limited characters and choices because there some abilities that you need in order to really play well. If you are sick of League or DOTA. I suppose you can pick this up but I only put 37 hours into it and I really pushed myself to do that.			"

												I don't have a whole lot to say about Demigod, since its a DotA-like and unfortunately I don't have much interest in this type of game. It seems like its pretty good. Very small selection of characters, but a large selection of skills so you have a bit more flexibility inside a game.I personally give it a pass, but it seems like it would rate up to people who like games such as LoL or DotA2.If you liked this review, please have a look at my other reviews.[/u] "

												very very nice co-op game, with friends, Multi or even single with bot allies. Developer's abandonment of it is a real shame. no cards or real attention given to it. However, there is a wonderful MOD in the forum to add more content, items, and balance (AI is really nice after applying patch), the in-game achievements you can attempt to achieve (ANd they are many and hard) is a great single player incentive or goal, as is the great amount of customization you have in setting up an AI skirrmish which can be as causally easy or as  overhwelmingly stomp your A** hard as you'd like to attempt..lol. The level up system, including some carry over items that become permanate in your God is also very entertaining. If you can find a group to get in multiP it woud be nice and you'll enjoy it. But even alone with just AI allies it is still a very fun and interesting game. well worth the money and to have in your library.			"

												Unfortunatly I was quite dissappointed in this game. It has a really awesome look to it and have some decent opening story, however what has unimpressed me is the actual gameplay is like a single-player Dota2, but with a couple of changed. One being that you can summon your own minions to aid you, you can also upgrade your citadel so that the waves of spawn that attack the enemy's spawn get better armour, weapons and units to help give a tactical edge in a sense of Command and Conquer and researching technology, but spending gold to do that means you won't be able to buy items for yourself to equip at the shop.You have capture points too and as I said this game is fun if you like the Dota2 style and it's got some unique characters and a compelling story, but it's a shame that there is no campaign mode because I would've loved that. The idea that the different worlds would end differently depending on the demigod you chose.This game really isn't for me, I already have Dota2 and I'm not really a fan of that game either so unfortunatly I'm not going to spend anymore time on this game.

												This game, like so many others in the MOBA-""genre"" (and no, I can't say that without being MASSIVELY sarcastic), is utter garbage. Rubbish. Worthless. You have a shïtty ten ""characters"" to pick from, and you'd expect that with a roster that tiny, the few that're available will all feel completely unique and incredibly well-made, polished to a mirror sheen and then some! But guess what? NOPE! The so-called ""characters"" are all bland and uninteresting, and there's absolutely zero balance between them.Hell, there's absolutely zero balance in the game PERIOD! Now, I haven't played it for a while, so I can't know for sure, but last time I DID play it worked like this: earn a focking rëtardedly massive amount of gold, buy All-Father's Ring, win the game. Because buying a singular item REALLY should make so much difference to everything in the game that you LITERALLY become unstoppable, unkillable and automatically win. Honestly, I don't get why they wouldn't just make it so that whichever player gets that focking stupid amount of unspent gold ""earns"" his/her team a victory auto-stupid-matically.The game has so many glitches, balance issues and outrageously rëtarded design errors that it's just plain unplayable. Considering also that DOTA2 is now available, I will personally voodoo-curse anyone BUYING this game instead of playing DOTA2 FOR FREE. 0.7/10			"

The camera is difficult to control (or maybe I'm just an idiot; you never know). I spent a few minutes trying to familiarize myself with it, but gave up after six minutes. In contrast, I managed to learn LoL controls in less than five minutes. I'm very good at learning controls, but this game stumped me. Also, I couldn't even find an online lobby. Doesn't seem like anybody plays this game, which is a real downer. If it was slightly more popular, I'd force myself to learn the controls.			"

												This game, while clunky, may have its upsides but it has some major downsides.Good:1. Varied selection of unique champions.2. Skill trees allow for more than 1 combo of skills which makes each time playing a champion differ from previous times.3. Several unique maps to chose from with each one containing objectives to capture.4. Skilled AI system that allows for the game to be tuned to fight on your level in a player vs AI match.5. The graphics are very good for a MOBA.6. Lots of upgrades and plenty of items to pick.Bad:1. The game feels very slow in pacing which can make very simple decisions fatal. (like accidently stepping into an AoE and taking 5 seconds to get out of it)2. The towers aren't a big deal when you have at least 1 minion around thanks to them usually targeting minions, so tower diving is easy when it shoudn't be.3. Even with movement accelerating gear; getting to lane is an adventure. It takes about 30sec just to travel from the base to your ""lane"" even with a good bit of movement speed gear.4. Some character animation take a while to pull off (Such as regulas gaining his wings) and will end up practically making you stun yourself for a few seconds.5. Towers can be hit from out of their range with certain champions.Ugly:1. The ballence between champions is missing. Almost completely. Take for example Regulas. This champion is supposed to have the best range in the game, yet His snipe ability does a measly 500 at max rank while another champion can (with high range) throw a knife to deal over 900 damage. Regulas' ability require a windup where this knife slinger champion does not.2. The champion ""rook"" can practically stage a 1 man wrecking machine event where he is able to practically run down towers with almost no damage taken thanks to an ability that restores a large sum of hp (800-2000) while dealing the same amount as damage to the targeted tower. This, with his 700-1700 dmg hammer, will almost 2 shot building aside from the citadel.3. Rook also has a very troll ability. He can damage a building while healing himself. This can be used on ANY building in the map including the Citadel. So he can literally end his own team if he so desired.4. Being that this game is so uncommon in the multiplayer servers, nobody will be on to play with for about 99.99% of the time. This pretty much means if you want to play with anything besides an AI, you need to buy another copy for a friend, or just have them buy it. "

												It has been a while since I wanted to play Demigod and I'm happy to say I'm pretty satisfied, despite a few negative reviews I've read about it. In fact, I fully agree that Demigod is a really underrated game, and it's one of the few MOBAs I could relate to Dota in terms of quality. It doesn't have the complexity of the previous one, but it is still quite entertaining even so. It requires thinking and study - although not as much as Dota -, mainly due to it's minions system. Being so, the game doesn't feel boring after a while - even though, I guess an in-game recommended item build would be very helpfull.While it is a bit hard to add inovative elements to the game genre, Demigod succeeds in having it's own traits that defines it's originality. Each hero has a unique story and they all seem to avoid the commonplace; it's quite easy to feel empathy for some characters (such as Rook - literally a moving castle).What may bother some is that the game's active community is actually pretty scarce. The AI is enough to keep the game fun and interesting; but being a MOBA, it is possible to feel the lack of other players after a while.In summary, I do recommend Demigod, it surely is worth it's cost. The game succeds in keeping you entertained, even though you have to rely mainly on playing against the AI.			"

												3.5 Stars.  This was the first arena genre game I played.  I enjoyed the style, the graphics and some of the characters in particular.  The general 'capture the flag' feel of the game means you can play a number of rounds on your own or with friends in an hour. However, the game needs polish.  It lacks a tutorial or really any information on how to play the game. I also found the speed difficult initially and the suggestions online were really helpful in getting more comfortable with the game.  My other issue was that I found after playing for a while that I didn't really have a strong reason to go back to it unless I wanted a quick bash. Even so it was a worthwhile experience and I'd still recommend it despite the steep learning curve.			"

												If you enjoy League of Legends or DotA in any way, this is a good stand-alone game that takes those elements, adds great graphics, more diverse skills and trees for heroes, upgrade system to the Citadel (base), and even has some light RTS elements controlling minions (depending on if you pick an Assassin or General).  It's not 100%, but it's cheap and has great potential!			"

												An amazing game that suffered a poor launch, and could have been as big as League of Legends if it wasn't for stardock messing up their end of the job with the netcode. Demigod was a true victim of Piracy, at launch it had around 18,000 units sold while there were over 100,000 players on the servers. Extremely solid ARTS, all of the characters work well together and are interesting enough.Voice acting is ok.The music is cliche but definitely good enough to get you into those intense moments.Graphics mostly hold up to today's standards even though the game is from 2009.

												This, IMO is the best MOBA created. There may not be many heroes/demigods, but unlike most popular MOBAs, each of those demigods has a skill tree which you can use to build your character in a completely different style each game. Plus, in addition to an item shop yuo can spend your gold on upgrades for your whole team. There are fun different modes and maps, and overall a great experience.The only downside is the online multiplayer is peer-to-peer, which can have some lag issues if you don't have a great connection, and not enough people play it - but that is a problem we can fix by giving it a go!

Balance is horrible.Oh and you have to have one of those stardock #$%# accounts to activate part of the game and they provide one of the most horrible experiences in existance.			"

												Demigods is a MOBA. It has a unique look, and very unique characters. There is a very very small community for this game, your not very likely to find anyone from match making. However playing it with friends is a fun experience. Grab a 4 pack and play it with some mates.			"

												A very underrated MOBA, and the only one I've played where the backstory actually makes sense in the context of the game (as far as MOBAs go anyways). It's worth checking out if you're burned out on LoL or Dota and looking for a different take on the genre. That being said, the online is all but dead, so make sure you've got some friends on board too.			"

												Demigod is one of the first dedicated MOBAs to come out. Way before the LoL or DoTA hype. From Stardock, the company that gave us Sins of a Solar Empire (yeah, I'm confused too) comes an excellent game with one major flaw: Lack of content. Demigod has only a handful of maps and even though they look gorgeous (bear in mind this is an old game so be lenient) there's just too few of them. The same happens with the Heroes. The characters are all detailed and have different playstyle and abilities but there's so few of them that you'll grow tired pretty quickWithout a single player campaign or some kind of story mode, there's really no reason to buy this game over some of the newer (and even free in some cases) MOBA other than curiosity. You won't find many people to play with (community is almost dead for what I've seen) but it could function as a good time sink for you and your friends when you are bored.I'll recommend Demigod, but bear in mind you can probably get something much better for free.

The graphics are above average for it's genre, and the number of units on screen towards the end of a battle can be very impressive!If you'd like to watch my full 1080p review of Demigod, here's the link

												It has been a while since I wanted to play Demigod and I'm happy to say I'm pretty satisfied, despite a few negative reviews I've read about it. In fact, I fully agree that Demigod is a really underrated game, and it's one of the few MOBAs I could relate to Dota in terms of quality. It doesn't have the complexity of the previous one, but it is still quite entertaining even so. It requires thinking and study - although not as much as Dota -, mainly due to it's minions system. Being so, the game doesn't feel boring after a while - even though, I guess an in-game recommended item build would be very helpfull.While it is a bit hard to add inovative elements to the game genre, Demigod succeeds in having it's own traits that defines it's originality. Each hero has a unique story and they all seem to avoid the commonplace; it's quite easy to feel empathy for some characters (such as Rook - literally a moving castle).What may bother some is that the game's active community is actually pretty scarce. The AI is enough to keep the game fun and interesting; but being a MOBA, it is possible to feel the lack of other players after a while.In summary, I do recommend Demigod, it surely is worth it's cost. The game succeds in keeping you entertained, even though you have to rely mainly on playing against the AI.			"

												In desperate need of a single player campain.  Sad, this game could have been pretty good.  The lack of a campain left me wondering what to do, and quickly wondering why I was playing.  A small gripe would be that the fluff desciption of the all father disapearing is wrong, the game into says he was killed.  This proto-moba could have had a lot going for it, and I would be thrilled to see some of the demi-gods show up in Smite, as at least 2 (Sedna and Queen of thorns, aka The Obsidion Butterfly) are real historical dieites.  The Queen may show up, shes Aztac/Mayan, but i doubt they will fit in a lone Inuit diety in the mix.  Still between the two Sedna is the one with a dwarf planet named after her.			"

												Before the DOTA/MOBA games really took off commercially (i.e before HoN, LoL, DotA2, etc) Demigod lept onto the bandwagon and bought with it really nice graphics and fast paced action.Unfortunately the game bombed, it came out too early in the fad when the original DotA had such a strong fan base that people passed by this game. But the thing is that it's a good game, it looks great, the classes are varied (even if there are only about 10 character choices), and it's pretty deep. Unlike other MOBA games Demigod allows you to not only spend money on your hero and his items, but upgrade your towers, nexus/castle, even minion waves. It has a bunch of unique elements but it let down by the fact it never got the promised expanded champion roster, making this a game fun for LANs (until DotA2 released officially) but not for online play. Plus it's cheap!			"

												I played this game for a few hours. Found out that it's pretty fun, 'cause I can just play single player, testing out how different things work.I found out, I love The Rook. He's awesome. Tried him as a physical damage dealer first, found it a little hard, then realized that he's an epic mage. Bringing up towers, that can chain with those of your team? Quite stronk. And a tower on him, working the same way? Up to 8 turrets of that kind you can summon anywhere you want? OP. Set up a base, get ambushed by the whole enemy team, and WIPE THEM THE FAHK OUT. Then you're stronk stronk stronk.This game is a lot of fun, and you don't even need to go competative. There are tournaments, single player, probably multi as well. They're fun as well. Took one, that was two hours of gameplay. Nice way of forcing a little gameplay on yourself if you think you need more. It's ultimately a very strange game, because it seems very deserted. But fun nevertheless! I enjoyed it, a lot. For 10€, it's not bad, since you can play all alone, plus the loading is quick and painless.			"

Demigod has only a handful of maps and even though they look gorgeous (bear in mind this is an old game so be lenient) there's just too few of them. The same happens with the Heroes. The characters are all detailed and have different playstyle and abilities but there's so few of them that you'll grow tired pretty quickWithout a single player campaign or some kind of story mode, there's really no reason to buy this game over some of the newer (and even free in some cases) MOBA other than curiosity. You won't find many people to play with (community is almost dead for what I've seen) but it could function as a good time sink for you and your friends when you are bored.I'll recommend Demigod, but bear in mind you can probably get something much better for free.

												This Honestly might be the most nothing game ever created. Like, people put their heart and soul into this game, writing pages of lore and spending years devloping it. But then you play it, and you right click on some one, and it goes ok, and maybe there is a spell or two and then you die and come back, and you buy items and you arent sure if they did anything and then you win or lose and you hhave NO IDEA if it was because of you. 10/10			"

												I see people comparing this game to Leage of Legends and Dota, but it's really not anything like them. For one, the controls are awful. The camera is difficult to control (or maybe I'm just an idiot; you never know). I spent a few minutes trying to familiarize myself with it, but gave up after six minutes. In contrast, I managed to learn LoL controls in less than five minutes. I'm very good at learning controls, but this game stumped me. Also, I couldn't even find an online lobby. Doesn't seem like anybody plays this game, which is a real downer. If it was slightly more popular, I'd force myself to learn the controls.			"

												Maybe one of the most underrated precursors of all those present-day e-sport games. Basically a tower defense game, where you play one out of ten characters on the battlefield (in RTS view, mouse-click movement). The towers of the very sophisticated maps are pre-build, so you can focus on raising down enemy structures, knock out enemy chars and minions or defend your towers. Still good looking graphix, runs on ancient systems and last but not least a very rejoicing coop Multiplayer (vs AI or human players).7/10 points in my opinion; 9/10 if you play it on LAN; absolutely worth the 10 bucks			"

												tl;dr Do I recommend this game? Hell no. It's the worst the MOBA world has to offer, which is impressive as it doesn't even have a player base and that's usually the biggest problems of MOBAs. This one is shoddily designed from the ground up. It can be fun for your occasional casual romp with friends, but don't expect any deep or balanced gameplay. This game is ALL over the place.Probably the worst MOBA-style game I have ever played in my entire life. But I'll get into details, so bear with me here.Demigod looks absolutely amazing. The graphics are, even to this day, absolutely stunning. The levels, Demigods and even the creeps are amazingly designed with great detail. Sounds are crisp and distinct and you can easily tell what is what and what just happened. So presentation is top notch.AI is completely brain dead and there's basically a coin toss if you'll win a game against hard AI with hard AI on your team, because your team will do some absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crap like trying to push while one of your portals is captured. Yeah. Ok then. Item balance is all over the place. Literally. Some items (Unbreakable Boots, Groffing Warplate etc) are absolute must-haves no matter what demigod you are playing, others are utterly useless yet priced like they're premium items. Mkay then.There's no ability scaling at all, meaning that caster demigods have very sharp power steps throughout the game, and a caster hitting a power step before you can spell utter doom for you if you're on the other side. In-hand Demigods are all over the place. Characters like Unclean Beast are WOEFULLY imabalanced, and a fed UB can singlehandedly win the game against a full team of three demigods without even breaking a sweat, while Demon Assassin is a character I'm scratching my head as to why he's even in the game. Even with his insane burst, he can barely kill anything at all, and once his burst is used he's a free kill. There's some utterly stupid items in this game. Who thought that a relatively cheap consumable that gives you +50% HP was a good idea? EVERYONE uses them, ALL the time, which means that you basically have to kill people twice over, as they suddenly gain a second healthbar mid-battle. Usually they've already started running away then, and just as you're about to finish them off BOOM! They're back to almost full health due to that utterly stupid INSTANT USE item. Why is it instant use? I...I don't even.The Citadel upgrades are a neat addition and is legitimately something I would like to see in other games as well. Because those actually change the dynamics of the game a lot, and while some upgrades are headscratchers (death penalty reduction? WHAT?) most upgrades do have a place on some maps and some are must-haves on every map.There's a good variety of maps. From smaller 2v2 maps to humongous 5v5 maps. Good variety and they look awesome, all of them!Controls are...well. I dunno how to describe it. They only work half the time. You can right click to make your demigod move to a specific spot, only to have him suddenly stop. Unless you are actively paying attention at that very moment, your demigod will stand there getting murdered, while you think he's running for his life. And no, I don't mean when you're hit by stuns, as that does give you a big hint in that all your abilities are redded out while you're stunned. Defstacking is OP. It seems like the best way to win this game is to just stack armor and health. There are no percentage-damage based items to counter big stacks of health, nor are there any penetration items to punish extreme armorstackers. So stack armor and health and just never die unless you do something utterly stupid.Artifacts. I don't even wanna talk about these. Hilariously expensive. Why are these even here? 18k for an item seems like they're NEVER going to get use. I've seen a mage slayer (8k) now and then, but usually only in really long games. And IF someone gets a hand on one of these, the game is over. Plain and simple. Unless that player is mario or demon assassin. Then you can just laugh. If he's unclean beast though, you're done. But you probably lost long before he even got any artifacts.Online is deader than dead. No one plays this game anymore, so if you want to play with anything but brain dead AI-teammates you need to get some friends. Then you'll probably end up hating eachother as this game is an utter mess.			"

												I´d give this game a 6 out of 10, but only because I played it on release back then.I ""recommend"" this game only to ""senior gamers"" and if you get it at a SERIOUS discount.This game is like an old ""DOTA /LOL"". But noone plays it anymore. I bought this 4pack for me and my friends for about 5€ and we had a few rounds of fun with it because it reminded us of the old times when we played it shortly after release. The game still has its charme. The graphics scales nicely and the ""heroes"" are different enough. Its not as fast as lol/dota, so its fine for me.Newer players - stay away from it, theres better out there. Old players - bring your friends.			"

												Cool game. Different. Multiplayer doesn't really work at times. No servers and no support. However, from the overall presentation, the graphics and audio and the very fun and addictive gameplay, Demigod is one of the best PC strategy games. This is a must buy for strategy fans looking for something new. The game was ahead of it's time. DOTA fans should have fun with this game.			"

												Having played DOTA, league of legends and rise of the immortals, I was becoming a bit sceptical of the MOBA style games. Not only do they use the same tired map but the gameplay is soley focused on the hero advancement. Demigod mixes things up with ability to not only upgrade your own hero abilities, but that of your creep/buildings/team via the citidal upgrades. Games can be tailored to your playing style with a nice variety of game options. The heroes are unfortunately unbalanced with some clearly more powerful than others. One area which would have been nice to improve is the AI. The jump from normal AI to hard is clearly a big leap and there is no way to adjust the AI stats to allow you to fine tune them. A simple sliding bar to adjust XP rate , HP , mana etc would have been of great benefit to the title I feel especially as the PvP community is all but dead. Still despite this, the game is worth picking up for under £7.			"

												The game itself is fun - very fun. In fact I might say that in terms of gameplay demigod is my favorite RTS game in the style of mobas. However - the single player is very meh. AI never does anything different and putting 2 ai's together is guaranteed to result in a infinite stalemate. And that's really it for this review. The multiplayer is all but dead - filled with nothing but elitists and impossible for newbies to get a game going. I played this about a year ago, so I can only imagine it is only more dead now. I tried very hard to get a game going - went to the official forums and made a newbie thread and asked for anyone to play with me. Though some said yes, I never heard from them again and they didn't respond when I contacted them. So I went into the online play in-game and joined one of the three games they had going - all were elitist games that didn't want newbies - I tried anyway because I was sick of single player. Told them up-front that I was new. I was kicked and told to go to another game that was in the lobby - so I did. Then they kicked me and told me to go to the one I was just kicked from. Finally I met someone willing to play with me. The most horrible thing happened: The game crashed in the last 3 minutes of the game. It was already a done game - he was attacking my primary base. Somehow the game awarded me the win though - told me that the other guy lost connection. I guess there is some glitch that people can take advantage of and do this - because as soon as I contacted him he called me a cheater and refused to talk to me and swore he was done trying to help ""fake"" newbies. I love the lore and the gameplay but since single player mode is bad, and multiplayer is practically unplayable I cannot recommend this game at all.			"
