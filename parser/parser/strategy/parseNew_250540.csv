Early Access Review
								What the hell happened to this game? When I backed the game on Kickstarter years ago, it actually had some interesting gameplay: tile-based strategy, items, multiple characters... That's all gone now. What's left is... a repetitive, unbalanced, and uninspired button-mashing action game.This is the first game that after years of work has actually gotten much less developed than when it started! It's sad. I don't know where they're going, but it doesn't seem like a good place. Maybe they plan to someday add all the interesting features back into the game, but for the moment stay away.			"

Early Access Review
								Kickstarted that game LONG ago, looked promising with some kind of strategy in real time, involving a hero with support troop battling enemies. What we got is a strange action game where you spam buttons, every enemy move in a chaotic way and you have some bullets, but not much strategy involved... In fact, you empty both your guns, you use your grenades, then usually some enemies are still alive. The key then? Melee them going on their square... They'll catch in fire and you can just spam the attack until they die. You either win in 30 seconds or lose in 10-20 seconds. And every mission look the same.It really feels like a game made by 1 or 2 persons in their house in their spare time. I know it's early access, but with a delivery date that was stated for October 2013, it's nowhere near a good game.If they don't do major fixes, don't buy this game, it's not worth it. I've kickstarted other games that did deliver what they promised in general (Massive Chalice, Darkest Dungeon, Battle World Kronos) in time and I think this game is going nowhere.			"

								I am really torn about this game? And here are the reasons why... I saw it about half a year ago. It was supposed to be a downloadable release on xbox 1 maybe 360... anyway, the sprites and enemies were the same however the background has drastically been changed from a lucius HD platform to a pixelated pile of dog doo doo. I understand that this is a early access game or whatever but I purchased it on sale for half price and it still isnt worth any money. Its an unfinished demo, not even, a taste of what the game might be like if it ever comes full circle. Which it prob. wont. Dont miss understand, I really like where the game is going, and I hope it gets finished, but I cant help but feel that some of these smaller game developers are slowly watching their dream slip between their fingers so they throw whatever they can at the community to scrounge whatever money they can out of the ""burnt-out"" project their shoveling on real fans. Games like Mighty No. 9, CHASM, games I want more then anything to be realized, to become lies and trickery. This game has been around way to long to not be finished by now. God, I hope these ICs prove me wrong, but I'm not gonna hold my breath and you my friend shouldnt waste your money.			"

Early Access Review
								Early backer here. Backed on Kickstarter based on the pitch in the middle of 2013. Played the alphas, liked where it was going. Seriously, look at the difference:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1054244612/c-wars-roguelike-pixel-art-pc-game/descriptionTons of radio silence throughout this, of course. There was limited mention about why things were taking so long, what was going on with the team, etc. Eventually I just forgot about it.Then, suddenly, they went to Early Access. Man, was I excited - I thought the alpha must have progressed enough to warrant releasing it on Steam! But... alas... it wasn't the same game pitched at all. It didn't feel the same, the battlefields weren't structured the same way, my dreams of playing this on a touch interface were basically shattered.What happened? Everyone, including the dev, said to give it time. Fair enough. So, after August 20th, 2015, I waited. I figured, well, if things need to be overhauled, that'll take a few months, right? Three? Why stop there? Let's wait 5, just to give it extra time.Man, what a let down. I know it's early access still, but this game's two years past the original deadline. It feels like a flash game, it runs like a flash game. Activating the ""grid"" to see movement literally puts hex outlines in a checkerboard pattern on a square grid, and the player can only move in the four cardinal directions. The controls for keyboard are rather poor. The best part of the game, the animations, are choppy and have a limited amount of frames each (it's like they were animated on fours rather than twos or ones) and the sprites themselves are low detail. It's hard to get into the game when it's so clunky, but the majority of it seems to be moving from battle to battle with little to do inbetween. The combat itself is tedious to the point that I'd rather just go do chores.I can't recommend this game. I'll probably let it sit in my library until it's out of early access (if that happens), but it's on my ""remove from account without refund because it's that bad"" list.			"

								I usually like to make really long, and very detailed reviews but this one isn't worth the time, I'll make it basic and simple. This game is great, fun, and was going to be a very interesting and enjoyable experience. So why is it bad? The creators havn't made any more development for roughly five months now, have gone completly dark, and no one knows why or for what reason. This is the second time they've promised a fully developed game and have just vanished, letting the game rot and taking all the money supporters gave off and purchasers spent. Find their names and do yourself a favor, if they ever make another game, don't buy it. Inform everyone backing them. Thanks, see yah round.			"

								tl;dr version first: this game is a waste of time.The tutorial is ridiculous and has too much in-universe fluff.  I don't mine Rogue-Likes if there's a point to it.  This game is quite pointless, however, as the difficulty in missions make no sense early on.  There's no real way to earn any progress, the store where you're supposed to upgrade your units is broken, and there are far too many glitches to count.  At one point, my character got stuck in the far-right, bottom of the screen and is completely unable to do anything.  Meanwhile, this zombie with a machine gun, dressed up as a police officer, has decimated my entire team.  But there's nothing that I can do except to go back to the Title.  The lack of in-game manual is substituted by hitting the ""Tab"" key to get some vague explanations about features that you can't even use.			"

								Early days, still plenty of promise. 3 available characters who all have different skills and quests available. Missions basically played like real-time chess, characters move on squares while a bunch of enemies spawn that you take down using abilities, 1-use items and anything else that goes boom. Levels didn't seem to be randomly generated as suggested, not sure if that's a bug or WIP. Gamepad and mouse controls were available but only keyboard worked for me. Asking price is fair given the current content and with everything said, if a fan of tactics, pixel art and anime it's worth at least keeping on your radar.

Early Access Review
								Opening caveat: I am a kickstarter backer of the game, and received this copy as a result of thatA lot of reviews comment on the fact that you're not getting a lot for your money. There's hardly any content, and it's incredibly buggy. These reviews were posted within the first day or two of release, and do not reflect the current stage of the game right now. This is, after all, an early access game. Oni-punks have been releasing near-daily updates, adding content and tweaking bugs since release. Is this a finished product? Not hardly. But what it IS is a taste of what the final game will entail. You have a grid, you move on the grid, you attack your enemies. Conserve your ammo, choose your targets, and time your attacks properly to avoid reprisal. There are three characters, each with unique weapons and abilities. Each has a set of stages through which they must pass, along with optional side missions. Since that first release, bugs have been fixed, the stages have been improved and organized better, and the game in general just feels better as well. As I said, it's still more of a demo than anything, but it's growing steadily.In time, you will have helper characters, along with a wider variety of heroes and weapons from which to choose. Sure, it's been a long time coming, but it's heartening to see these basic building blocks, to know that the game DOES exist. As long as the flow of updates continues to be as rapid as it has been, I, for one, will continue to recommend this game.			"

								I don't like long review, let's make it short: (A) I'm a backer of this game  (B) I like it. Good: * Daily update since the initial earlyaccess release* Gorgeous pixel art* Sci-Fi action game & Tower defense* Looks like Megaman battle network* Gain your XP by eating bread and wormsBad* I could use a jill sandwich but  I don't like bread..To be honest, the current gameplay is straight forward enough: Realtime combat; Tower Defense element; Control your hero and make combo; Try to survive as long as you can in different missions, and, it looks like Megaman battle network, seriously! For a humble price like this, $7, plus at least 2 hours play time and replayability, people are still complaining? With the free backer keys on top of that? Really? Sure there are  stuff need to be added. The game needs a final touch too, but, it could be a great game. Plus, I can see there are more coming, like story, store, item management and stuff. That's why it's still a early access product isn't it?I am a backer of this project myself although I backed it thru paypal not ks but I still love their KS video which is pretty funny. 2 years ago, honestly, I only backed the project because of these fancy animations.Now? It's more like my type of game.That's my 2 cents.			"

								For this cheap of a price, this game is freaking fantastic. I love it!Beautiful pixel anime graphics, great unique real-time action combat in a block-based battlefield system. There's a bunch of characters to choose (3 at the moment), more to come I'd presume, all with their own unique weapons an play style and missions. Same with the enemies, there's a handfull of them with their own unique attacks to tackle.

At first I was confused with the game's combat when I looked at the trailer, was it turn-based combat or real-time? Turns out it was the latter but placed in a block-based battlefield system.You can't say no to this game for that price. Althought it would be great to have mouse controls, please devs? =)Just to counter the cons people are saying about the game:-""certainly nonfunctional""= it's functional and working just fine.-""There are no indications as to what the controls are, or what you are trying to achieve within the game.""= there is indications of what the controls are, and what your objective is in the game.-""There is no explanation of what the game's system actually are.""= Yes there is, which is the controls description			"

								Just like other reviews have stated, this game is nowhere near what was promised when the kickstarter campaign started. I tried to give it the benefit of a doubt, playing the latest updates and going further into the game. But even with that, it lacks any depth and the gameplay is very lackluster. The end result is this mess of ideas that is poorly, POORLY executed. I would not recommend this game to anyone, as even the developers have seem to given up on the game.Note: I am campaign backer, and there was no saving grace I could find in this game.

Early Access Review
								To preface this review, this is based on the Early Access version I was provided from the Kickstarter I had back almost 2 years ago. With that being said, let me be perfectly clear: This is not a game. This is essentially a limited demo with pretty much an hour worth of content. Due to the incredibly unfinished condition of this ""game"", I cannot recommend it to anyone. When it comes the game itself, what it provides it decent enough. Three separate characters, each with their own missions (although they barely vary) and they all control pretty differently. EDIT 8/20/15: They now have a prompt that shows the control scheme, which alleviates some of the issue of not knowing what's going on.That's not nearly enough to understand what's going on with multiple weapon types, ammo counts to manage different ranges for each and much more. You end up fumbling around until you somehow find the magic attack that is strong against the particular enemy type. Gameplay aside, there is practically nothing left. No story, no customization, very limted sound and music. After waiting two years after plunking down cash on this project, I am horrifically disappointed that this is all they've had to show. I pray they are able to crank out updates on a regular basis to flesh out what is essentially 99% of the remaining content. If they can release an actual game soon and not a paid and shallow demo, then you should look into this. As for now though, stay far away.			"

Early Access Review
This early access release is actually worse than the alpha releases that came out before steam availability. What you currently see, the title screen, 3 barely playable heroes in a few stages with only a couple of finished enemy sprites has been in development since early 2013. This is all a full 2 years+ of dev time shows. Add to it the fact that they had spent 3 years prior to work on the engine itself. Speaking of the engine - ""Our self-developed engine ensures better performance. Small reminder: ONI-engine packed 800+ pixel animations into 1Megabyte, about half the size of a photo taken with your phone."" That was scrapped, the entire game is now based in unity. Originally the animation and engine looked great the artists had ton tons of sprites and animation of high quality. Late 2014 Oni dissolved it's team. While the Founding dev nsisted it was due to ""fame and discipline"" the press at chuapp (a Chinese news blog) was able to contact former team members who stated (loosely translated)Originally posted by devteam:""two reasons: Project outlook is bleak and unbearable leader character.""Leaving only it's founding developer to direct, program, (possibly animate as well since the sprites have gotten worse) and market the game. The development remained stagnant for months. Currently the founder has hired a minimal team and had this to say about developmentOriginally posted by founder:""Well we don't have the manpower or time or willing to add anything else into the game which is not related to the game itself."" (Extra content, proper DRM, etc) ""We have barely enough people to finish the game.""AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This game is not worth your money. It is not feature rich, it is hardly playable, and it shows no promise of ever getting better.This game has managed to get worse in gameplay/features and animation since original pre-steam release..

Then, when the beta came out there were changes (of course) but still had this feel. Multiple weapons, massive enemy swarms, summoning aid to cover you.Then this unplayable mess is released and is nothing like what I backed. Suddenly I'm fighting maybe 5 enemies with only 1 reload on my gun. My only attack, once I was out of ammo, was a low damage kick that used stamina. Stamina regens VERY VERY VERY slowly AND only if you are standing still.Maybe that's only a problem with the character I chose (the blue guy, forgot his name), but it was such a bad experience why would I try the others.Honestly, if I could, I would ask for my pledge back at this point.

								Disclaimer: I'm a kickstarter backer so the low play time count on Steam does not reflect  actual game time since I have been playing the alpha builds released prior to Steam. TLDR Game Description: Are you aware of the megaman exe series before? If you are, this plays a lot like it, if you aren't the units here move in real time along a grid, and you move on the grid to dodge enemy attacks and launch your own attacks. The game mechanics are extremely addicting as it is reflex and tactically based, there are lots of times you can die but you will want to retry it. Yeah so, just a background C-Wars was actually a game pitched in kickstarter more than 2 years ago, the dev team underwent severe issues both personally and financially and as a result the game spent time in development hell and entered early access by the skin of its teeth...this is the reason why the game has a lot of negative reviews when it was first launched it was really closer to a tech demo than an actual game. FORTUNATELY, the dev team went into super saiyan mode and started releasing daily updates since then, right now I can say it can be positively compared to other EA games in terms of actual content, and consequently is now worth the EA price. For the price of a cup of coffee you get beautiful pixel art, ok music and fun and frenetic gameplay. I suggest you buy it now because the price will likely increase. I mean at the end of the day the game is receiving daily updates, patches, bug fixes and various quality of life improvements so it will definitely be worth your purchase. Buy it now and encourage them to improve the game even more. Plus, it is highly original this is the first megaman exe style game I've seen anywhere apart from the original megaman exe games themselves.			"

Personally I think this is going to be something great.With the tutorial update, the game is much more clear on controls and gameplay. Also with so much changes for the past months, it just keep becoming more and more awesome.Just watch the gameplay video I made:

I suggest one playthrough with the tutorial before trying out impossible missions.  You'll get hella frustrated otherwise.Also don't keep playing missions that are killing you.  The more times you attempt the less time/more critical the situation with the mutants gets. (100 percent ends the game)Work in progress, for sure, but as it stands is well worth the money and support!			"

								Edit: 6/16/2016Don't buy, I defended this.thought they had a framework and was just going to add content over time andI must say by adding content for a while, it was items in game, there wasn't enough content to justify the price, oh yes today we got a cake, tomorrow we got eggrolls, Fantastic content, while there was a few characters added, it seems like alot was taken away from their orginal Concept while I thought it was the upgrade from flash to unity that changed this, Apparently it wasn'tSo they threw out alot of their kickstarter animations , characters, I didn't mind the whole level redesigns, again I thought it was going to be bigger and better, so no updates since march of last year, tottally diffrent from kickstarter, while they didn't tell anyone about the redesigns when it came to EA, to now where they commented on this review ""We'll continue to work hard to fill up the content and be entirely reachable for feedback and suggestions."" can be taken as a falseJust like my hopes for this gameOrignal short review for refrence, I deleted the long ranty reviewC-warsA Tatical Rouge-lite Arpg, that takes place on grid based battles using items and unitswhile controling your hero in real time, dodging and attacking with satasfying pixel animationsTD:LRVery early game devolpment, its framework is already set and content is going to be rolled in constantly , so for seven dollars your getting a promised Random generated Tatical Arpg Rouge lite game that will last you 45 minutes a play through, as its quick , Brutal, and always a new game due to the Rouge-like format of the game, with some amazing pixel animations and music			"

								A kickstarter bait-and-switch. Nothing like what was promised and a poor experience all round. Don't give these people more money to waste. Avoid.			"
