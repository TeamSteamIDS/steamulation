												When I bought Hydrophobia, I was expecting dynamic gameplay revolving around an awesome ability allowing the manipulation of water. Upon playing the game, I realized this is not much more than a repetitive tech demo for water physics. The gameplay is alright, but I found it to be quite boring. When I finally attained the ability to manipulate water, I found it to be lacking in functionality, and discovered that it is only useable on the final boss and in a few rooms before it.I also realized, that in order to attain 100% completion of the game, you need to be able to accomplish a difficult and unclear task on the first attempt. After failing the task once, it can not be attempted again. The only way to get 100% at that point, is to manually delete the save and to restart from the very beginning. This can be tedious to do as the task is found at the end of Act 1 or the beginning of Act 2, so you have to play for quite a while to get back, and you also have to reattain every medal that you might have had at that point, which in my case was all but two or three.The game includes a feedback option that allows you to choose aspects of the game that you did or did not like. Upon researching the company that made the game, I found out that they went bankrupt and that the feedback is now meaningless.Overall I'd say that this game is extremely disappointingly repetitive and lacking in gameplay, but I suppose that it is worth its low price.

												As majority of people say, not even worth the 0.49€ as many (including me) bought it for. Yes, the water physics and look is gorgeous, but that is it. The rest is absolutely awfull. They should never have made it like this, why not just make a physics engine video and spare the money on making this atrocity.1. Cutscenes -> huge ton of them, first you have a cutscene, then walk 2 meters (no joke, 2 meters, or even less), another cutscene, another 2 meters, another cutscene, another 3 meters, yet another cutscene. This game is filled with useless cutscenes that could have been done differently. There are cutscenes hidden as a dialogue, as camera feeds, as danger, they are everywhere to the point where I spent 15 times grabbing and letting go of my mouse every minute.2. Voice acting is just bad, main protagonist is so irritating I wanted to kill her myself, and the male support role jokes in so many stupid ways that I would smack him through the radio. There is difference between being a smartass and being a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you make a completely stupid joke as you're about to die.3. Bugs, oh so many, game is brutally linear and nothing wrong with that, but even being linear and with everything shining at you at where you're supposed to go, I got myself stuck several times to the point I couldn't find a way further. Small room, nowhere to go, nothing to shoot/press/do.1 hour wasted, 0.49€ wasted. Should have bought myself a beer instead, pour it into a glass, marvel at the water physics and then drink it. would be much better experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was originally released in an unfinished state, and consequently received a very bad reputation as result.  However, the developer has gone back and addressed most of the complaints and the result is a fun, technically impressive game that is well worth the money when on-sale. The controls, gameplay, and graphics are all above-average for a budget game and you will see things being done with water physics that you won't see in other games of this type.  If you enjoy third person shooters and/or neat water in games then you really can't go wrong.			",554,121,17,69,29,8,54

												This is a game about water. Oh, all right; the game is actually about shooting people in first person view on a sinking ship, but that's really besides the point. Hydrophobia utilizes a proprietary engine (the ""HydroEngine"") that realistically renders the ebb and flow of liquids, and this feature is the game's main attraction. Watching the waves crash around is fascinating; it really is quite impressive technology.The rest of the game is quite ordinary, however. The PC version is significantly improved over the original released on the XBox,  and features entirely new levels and a story that actually closes satisfactorily. But it is nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before and - once the thrill of watching the water move drains away - there's little reason to come back to the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Positives- Beautifuly done water (first time I have ever wrote that)Inexpensive game, even at full price its not expensive and on sale its cheap as chips.Nice mix of (not too difficult) puzzles, exploration and shootingLess generic protagonistLast act gives your character an interesting abilityNegatives-Very short game, I consider myself a slow player and I finished it in under 5 hoursSome parts are very samey, level design wiseLast (and only) 'boss fight' does not seem to fit the gameSo-so voice actingOverall I do recommend this game especially if its on sale as its an interesting setting and quite enjoyable, I am aware there was another version which was lacking but this version is pretty good. Sort of like a cut down version of Tomb Raider at a cut down price which is not a criticism.			",141,11,2,27,4,1,23

												Hydrophobia is a 3rd person action / shooter based around some great water dynamics. The water will flow from one room to the next, raise, lower, put out fires, and electricity will damage anything near it. Its a lot like being in a Zelda water dungeon. This is a good game with gameplay mechanics that are on par with big budget games like Uncharted and Batman: Arkham Asylum. It has the ledge climbing, destructible environments, swimming, camera hacking, wall cover, sneaking and even a Navi, which is similar to Arkham Asylum's detective mode, which will let you find encryption codes on walls, open doors from a far, hack consoles with a mini game, access cameras.There's a great balance between problem solving, shooting and exploration. There are only a few guns and really you won't need any other gun but the default phaser that you can hold the trigger to charge for bigger damage. There is a cover system, but I rarely used it. The downside for some purists would be the aim seems off since there's a 'target lock' system. What I mean is aim near something you can shoot and it lights red and will still count as a hit. Its not the best, but it stays in the realm of good. Even though the game encourages you to drown foes, electrocute them, blow up barrels and so on, it didn't really seem like I killed anyone in cool ways other than exploding barrels.The controls feel good, aim, shoot, move, move camera, roll (although I never used it once), jump, sneak, weapon wheel, diving, emerging, sticking to cover and so on. The heroine's movement is just a little stiff, but that's one of the only downsides to this game.The story is good for an indie action game, terrorists have taken over your cruise ship and you need to stop them. You've got a helpful voice that chimes in and tells you what to do, but it never feels like too much instruction. There are things left for yourself to figure out. There's even a nice waypoint to guide you in the general direction if you chose to use it to make the game easier for you to stay on task. It will always show you a dot on the screen where you need to go, but getting to that point is on you.The game looks great, with really nice water effects and camera sprays. The voice acting sounds good and there are an over abundance of cut scenes at the start, but they ease up in frequency as the game goes on.I've got the game on PSN and PC. Graphics wise I'd say PC is better, but it seems to be a beast on my PC's processor and not the graphics card. It is a game best played with a controller. The downside with PC is the camera feels chaotic.The game is short and sweet. The whole single player campaign is like 3 - 4 hours (I completed it for PSN) and at less than $5 I'm fine with that. There are challenge rooms to extend the game's length. It doesn't overstay its welcome and its a game that makes me want to play other things that the developers come up with, but alas they're defunct as of 2012.			",1129,324,52,104,96,15,167

												Wow... This game. Despite the very negative reviews for this game I picked it up in a sale for less than £1, I figured it must be worth that....I wish I still had that £1.This game has very little going for it. AWFUL voice acting, a poor story and repetitive gameplay mechanics make this game very difficult to enjoy. There are some nice graphic and physics effects with the water, but that's pretty much it.If you ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE water and are able to look past these major issues, you might get some enjoyment from it. If you're looking for a better alternative, I'd recommend filling a bath of water and holding your head under it for as long as possible, then trying to beat your time on subsequent attempts!

												This is a tricky game to review, and it really makes me wish that Steam had a neutral option. Although the description boasts about allowing you to control water, you don't actually gain this ability until the tail end of the game. This is rather unfortunate, as this power is what makes the game worth playing in the first place. Without this ability this is a mediocre game at best. It is buggy, generic, and sometimes a bit of an annoyance. However, I still enjoyed my time playing this game mainly due to how impressed I was by the water physics. It seems as though the entire budget for this game went in to this aspect, and it really does pay off. The water is lots of fun to play with, and is fantastically animated.I would recommend ONLY buying this if you are willing to play through the lackluster first half of the game just to reach what is essentially a water physics demo. I bought this game on sale for $0.50, and was happy with the experience I got for this price.			",250,97,1,41,24,0,27

												Straight up, I don't recommend this as a game. This is one of the most average third person shooters I have ever played. It's not necessarily a bad game, but it's not worth playing if you aren't going to buy it for the water effects/physics. If you are okay with a tech demo, then consider getting it.Hydrophobia: Prophecy was developed by an indie company, so straight away you know that it won't easily compete with the best TPS games out there.If I had to compare the entire game to other games, I would say that they took the climbing mechanics from Tomb Raider/Uncharted and made the sinking ship level from ""Tomb Raider: Underworld"" into a game.The game was made for almost no other reason than to show off the engine. It has dynamic water with physics that are incredible. You can shoot out windows to flood rooms even more and the water can either help you in combat or it will just make things more difficult. Unfortunately the game is short and doesn't really speed up. The game is apparently the first in a series, but when you are playing a 4 year old game, you know that there won't be a sequel any time soon.The gameplay would be far too unacceptable if it weren't for the water mechanics. It's essentially a corridoor shooter with an upturned bucket of water over it. Most of the time you'll die because you didn't know what the game wanted you to do. The waypoints and tips from your work partner who is known as ""Scoot"" are overdone as they literally tell you how to get through each section of the game. The character development is so weak that it shouldn't have even existed.The controls are okay most of the time, but the camera does not want to go under the water, so it really limits how far you can look up or down, which is really annoying when there are 3 metre waves flying everywhere.The story is just a lame excuse for a giant city on a boat to start sinking. Basically a bunch of terrorists claim that in order to save the world, they need to kill everybody on board. The story is weak as anything I'm afraid.The water is definitely the main focus of the game, as waves crash against you and send crates floating in all directions. I especially love it when you open a door and the water from the room you were in slowly seeps through. The water can appear almost gel-like at times, but since it was an innovation that literally tested the water (heheh), I can forgive it.This game could have shown how water can really change up the gameplay of a game, but unfortunately, they didn't make the mechanics good enough for it. The potential was there, but the presentation was sub-par.Unfortunately, no other games used this engine and other engines are starting to produce better effects, which is making this game even more obsolete and mediocre. Some things just don't get better with age.			",121,24,3,8,13,0,5

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Hydrophobia Prophecy is a Good game. If you can accept before playing that the game takes place in a breached ship and there will be a lot of water and disorienting waves, the action will be fun and you'll find yourself holding your breath in tight spotsThe climbing and acrobatics are easy to learn and yet still can be intense when you need to balance above a fiery pit. Sometimes what you need to climb on is not very obvious, and finding where to go can be harder than actually getting thereCombat is where the game does not shine, but it is not difficult to master and for a casual gamer, is simple enough that they can have a good time with it.Normal mode will have you breezing through the game in relative easiness, so if you are looking for a challenge you'll need to pick hard mode.Overall: This game is well worth it. If you haven't played the first Hydrophobia, play this			",1961,757,75,172,243,17,314

I think that the game is very short, but if you are in ""i wanna play a game that feels like a movie"" mood it's a perfect game.Total  7/10I think that this game has been extremely underated, yes now it's old and is very short, but the mechanics great and the effort that the developer spend on handle the water is very notable. If the game were released now, even being more expensive and with better graphics i think that totally will be worth it.			",277,66,8,39,24,1,27

												So, Hydrophobia: Prophecy; What a weird name for a game where the main protagonist isn't afraid of drinking water, nor is there any mention of a prophecy of sorts in the story. It's like the devs skimmed through a list of words with a hydro- prefix, picked the one that sounded cool, and added the ""prophecy"" subtitle so it looks like there's going to be a grand ""chosen one"" adventure. I think that they were trying to tie the title's name with their in-house ""HydroEngine[en.wikipedia.org]"", but in my opinion, they should have gone with something that represents the game properly.Hydrophobia looks like it was made to showcase the HydroEngine (which is impressive), and that's kind of where the problem stems from. Everything about this game is bad; the voice acting, gameplay mechanics, and story are all lackluster, compared to other indie games within the same price range. Sure, the water simulations are great, but why didn't the devs use that as the core gameplay mechanic, instead of shoving it as a background element? The player could have controlled the water ala waterbending, used it so solve complex puzzles, and employed to create tension in some stages - all we were left with is a so-so TPS, with a hodgepodge of game mechanics that's borrowed from other titles.Regarding the story: well, the story is forgettable. They've got this protagonist who has all of the excuses and skills to navigate a sinking ship, with a voice actor who is clearly trying to sound American, but slips in her native Irish accent once in a while. She's got some kind of a backstory that's shown in the opening cutscene, where aquaphobia has troubled her all her life, yet she swims like a pro - and it doesn't get mentioned ever again throughout the game. After the intro, everything regarding character development is thrown out of the window, in favor of a story that's all about escaping flooded rooms.If someone could pick up this IP, and revise some of the decisions made before, I'll definitely have a look at it. The industry rarely tackles games like this, and it would be a shame to just let a concept like this one die out. But choose a better name next time; something like ""Hydropower"", or ""Hydroelectric"". Better yet, name it ""Aquaphobia"".And there you have it.			",141,45,0,22,4,1,26

												Hmmm. Where do I start? Personally, I purchased this game due to curiosity, and because it seemed really-really interesting, and of course, it was on sale. I was a bit disappointed at first, but intrigued by the game engine used. The game has incredible water physics.I recommend this game for the same reason why I purchased it. if you're curious, seems interesting & it is on sale.Things to consider if you're planning on purchasing:Graphics:The graphics setting is not in-game but pre-game. Which means you have no option on changing the graphics setting when you are in game. Graphics at medium setting dropped my FPS. Compared to other games published in 2011 that I've played, this is not supposed to happen.Somehow the game crashed, probably due to the processing of the graphics.Controls:You will always be sprinting, even at the beginning of the game where you're in your residence. Its annoying, really. You can always crouch to walk to avoid sprinting.When you use the flash light, there is light but your character is not holding any flash light. I'm assumming the light comes from her headband. I'm using a Logitech F310 gamepad with this game and overall, I think the controls are okay.  Map:The map interface design is very weird. Interesting, but weird. The map control using the F310 gamepad is weird. Moving the map using the gamepad is very troublesome. I have not tried it with a mouse thoughCharacter Background Development:You will know that the main character, Kate has a water-related phobia. (as the name of the game suggests)You will wonder what the word Prophecy in the game title actually means.  No story was developed around the word Prophecy.When you dive, having less than 50% of oxygen left, you will hear things. (this annoys me a lot)Through the end of the game, you will not know what happened to Scoot, Kate's partner who guided her throughout the game.You will wonder what S.A.R.A. is and when were you introduced or atleast warned about it.You will end up with a major cliffhanger playing this game.This is a game I'd recommend to new game developers, to learn what not to do in designing the game, learn from the mistakes made making this game.

Full Review[yarow12.tumblr.com]Hydrophobia: Prophecy's main problem lies in the (only) boss fight and ending. The endboss is hell to deal with, but not too difficult once you figure it out (don't run out of barrels or you're screwed). The ending itself is... episodic. It wouldn't be a problem if a sequel was in the works, but this is highly unlikely so our best chances of satisfaction lie in getting a spiritual successor to a pretty great 10-hour game that has many surprising qualities that make it oh so worth playing. It even managed to take me back to my earlier days of gaming.There may only be one general path to follow at all times with some side/backtracking included, but I never noticed because of how expansive the ship that 98% of the game takes place on felt. The in-game map is very useful, by the way.There are tons (72?) of collectibles (objects, documents, Malthus documents) and medals.Wait, stop running! What's that on the shelf? Go grab it. Awesome, document 24 out of 48 found.There are multiple ways to take on enemies.Can you not, to save your own life, shoot a moving target? Aim for an explosive barrel (boom), electrical conduit (electrical boom), gas tank (flaming boom), or electrical wire (zzzap) that's conveniently hanging above a large puddle of water.Tired of taking cover during shootouts? Flood the room by shooting holes in breakable walls and windows. Have fun aiming up, down, and all around as enemies shoot you from every direction while completely underwater.The game's story and lore lies in the hidden messages left on the walls (think Bioshock) by the Malthusians--eco-friendly terrorists who love the environment more than your life (prepare to be disturbed). These messages can only be viewed using the MAVI scanner--a badass tablet that can hack cameras and consoles (fun, but tricky to get 100% perfection); download ciphers to unlock encrypted doors; reveal how much water will fill the room once a door is opened; and open the door 'cause ♥♥♥♥ that fire.The in-game database is basically your bestiary or encyclopedia of Hydrophobia.Found a bottle of sleeping pills in your apartment? Read about it and learn more about this attractive female you're playing as. Or say ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and continue your shooting spree.Scanned another hidden message left by the Malthusians? Read one of many interesting excerpts from ""From the works of Thomas Malthus"".Hate universal ammo (think Deus Ex: Invisible War)? How about a reversal? Universal gun, baby! One gun; five ammo types (rapid-fire, gel, sonic, energy, explosive).The following lag fix may or may not work with other games aswell. Use at your own risk.Ctrl+Shift+Esc (Windows Task Manager > Processes) > Right-click Hydrophobia: Prophecy > Set Priority > Normal.			",168,72,2,49,1,0,20

												I went back and forth a lot on this game. When it runs well it's a pretty fun 3PS, but there's weird bugs all the time, and you can just randomly die with very little warning (because of a fire thats under the water you can't see). I like the storyline, not to give away spoilers but it's kind of bioshockish, but I can't be bothered to read 400 journal entries, so I can't say for sure. What I get from cutscenes and character conversations is pretty interesting. The controls are pretty terrible though (at least the underwater ones) when you're swimming and you press spacebar the camera will freak out like a cat in a tumble drier and spin uncontrollably while you push your head against whatevers above you. If there isn't anything above you, then you'll IMMEDIATELY surface. Press C to go down, which immediately pins you to the floor. Swimming is pretty rough, and this is compounded by the fact that the game celebrates its water physics. The cover based shooting isn't bad, cover to cover works, I don't get what sprint does, except that she leaps forward about 5 feet then resumes regular walking speed. Also the majority of my deaths were from her not quite making a jump correctly, or invisible fireballs in the water (or from trying to get a stupid diary near fire that pretty much insta kills you). Rarely did the AI have a hand in any of my injuries.The enemy AI is dumb as a box of rocks, and will scan every square inch of where you aren't. They'll miss constantly, which isn't always a good thing as there always seems to be 400 exploding barrels and electrical boxes nearby. Though there's a point where you have to ""stealth kill"" using an exploding bullet (yes, I typed that correctly) but the stupid thing hits the corner of a pillar every time and never goes where you want it. In more open firefights its useful, but the thing is supposed to be stealthy.I like this game, I do, but the bugs kind of kill it, and honestly if this was from a bigger developer, or not under 50 cents I don't think I'd reccomend it. I might pay a few bucks for it, because it is pretty good, but its just kind of a let down for much more. ",67,12,1,13,4,0,3

												I do not feel this was worth the $2 I spent for it. This Tomb Raider style game begins with a short movie that tries to explain the premise. It leaves you slightly confused. From then on you must accomplish 1 or 2 tasks, then watch a cutscene i.e. you start in your apt. walk 2 steps to table, cutscene walk 2 steps to door, cutscene, approach elevator, cutscene, jump out of elevator, cutscene. I stopped playing at the 20 min mark.			",386,137,2,93,46,4,74

												A tale of two games, Hydrophobia prophecy starts wonderfully. Trapped aboard a city-sized ship as it is attacked by terrorists, you must survive and hide with your heroine's athletic climbing abilities. You'll be climbing and swinging on pipes and scaffolding to make your way around. Swimming is a large aspect as water fills hallways and elevator shafts. The effects are beautiful and the water will knock around objects. Eventually you get a gun but combat starts minimal. The story seems interesting and there are cool notes scattered around. You can hack cameras and use them to open doors. There are even a few water puzzles.Then everything takes a turn for the worse in the 3rd act. There is way too much combat and not enough of the platforming or climbing. You get the ability to control water somehow, but only get 1 power and it's a bit hard to control. More importantly, it's a ""weapon"" so you have either that or your pistol. The problem is that it doesn't switch well and it's difficult to attack using the water, which is what a player obviously wants to do. The game ends with a terrible boss fight that emphasizes the combat, which is the worst part of this game. The story just ends with no follow up on the other people you came into contact with.I really enjoyed the first two thirds, but the final act was a horrible, frustrating, chore.

												It's a 'meh' type of game, not good and not so bad. Its got some good things going for it, but it all seems rather bland. The main character (forgot her name) doesn't heve much to make her stand out. She's just your generic scaredy cat action heroine. The graphics are bearable; the only highlight is the water (and believe me, there is a LOT of water in this game). Shooting mechanics are decent. Story is awful though.Verdict: If this game is ever on sale again (got it for 49 US pennies) and you just wanna kill time, get it. Do not, and I mean DO NOT get this for full price, or you will be dissapointed. This game get 6 Spoony Points out of 10! ",53,3,1,6,0,0,1

												In sum, it's a very-very-very mediocre 3-view shooter with female heroine on the big ship which was stormed by terrorists. It has a quite simplistic gameplay, where nothing is original, but, on the top of all - it is so short, that it looks like demo-version, and not a complete game.I've already finished that game once (not on Steam), and I'll do it second time, but only because I've been a bad boy, and need to be punished.What exactly do I have against that game, you may ask me? Well, the same thing we all have against cheaters and other freaks in the multiplayer: they destroy our hopes to have a good time.Now goes the major spoiler: this game ending, when normal player is only warming up to some contest. Remember that we were promised by blurb? Control above the water! Just look at the title screen: there you are, a water-driving superwoman!In the game, there are only three acts, and the first two of them can be counted as a prologue. You start normally, step by step you're getting the game's mechanics, climbing and diving through the first trials, saving some powerful ammo for the rest of the game. Then goes the first serious shootout, where you probably might use some of the powerful shots you've collected. Then you learning to control water... two more rooms, and then BLAM! - the boss fight! And that's all!The Hydrophobia could have been a very good game... but it seems that over 95% of resources were spended strictly on the engine. We don't have enough game there, just a little prolonged presentation of that precious engine.It usually can be finished in less than 5 hours... But there is a Major Bug with savegames (there are single checkpoint system). Every now and then when you're restarting Hydrophobia, it drops your savefiles to the pit of Oblivion. Sometimes they returning... after 4-5 reloading. Mostly - don't. There are other bugs, as well, but loosing the savegame looks like the game feature, which is more fluent than water itself!I hate that game for what she could be - a very nice looking, smart-enough sleep-taker. But in our reality she's just a soother. 5.5/10 mark. You'll be much better with the Bioshock and Tomb Raider titles. And if you're really want some challenge,,, find Heavy Metal FAKK 2 - that's a real deal!			",725,239,45,156,102,5,232

It is almost worth playing just to mess around with the water physics.

												Sadly no multiplayer, sadly it's short, and sadly the main character is a bit annoying.But in gameplay it's a masterpiece. The best part (the end) is the shortest. The graphics are amazing, the waters physics are the best in this game yet. There is quantity, pressure, and every property it needs (or almost every).And the atmosphere, the story is great. Use your MAVI and there will be some writings in walls. I found them really interesting. ""Save the planet kill yourself"" and things like this. Great story.			",186,35,0,6,8,1,14

												TLDR: a game featuring interesting water physics and mediocre everythingelse. Worth the usual asking price of 0.50€ during sales  (but what wouldn't worth for that money?) but I'm not sure if it's worth your time.It may be interesting on a proper, strong computer if you want to check a tech-demo of water physics, but as a game it's horribly optimized - just as a reference as my laptop's specs wouldn't say much. I can play Arkham Asylum on 1366*768 without much changes I think medium-ish graphics with 30-60 fps. In Hydrophobia I got 19 fps in the credits. It's a scrolling white text before black background.As I said, the game is more of a tech demo. Opening doors with water behind them makes the water pour out, changing the water level, pushing items and you backwards, explosions don't just slash but really make the water moving, which is nice. But this does not serve as an excuse to have messy keyboard controls, way too high mouse sensitivity with mandatory autoaim, using a controller is gimped because not having reversed Y, only X axis, and the enemies often just forget to shoot you. They just walk in front of you, not even noticing you, even during the bossfight. Gameplay: Third person, consisting about shooting, running, ladder- and pipeclimbing, door-opening and repeating a hacking minigame. It's incredibly unoriginal.The bossfight at the end is also a letdown. You get powers to control water during the story which is cool, but the previous reviews were right - you get the power about TWO rooms before the bossfight, so you throw a bench away, complete a simple but well-used puzzle with the powers, shoot a few soldiers and there you go, bossfight, use your power to defeat it, woohoo!

												After reading many mixed reviews about this I had very low expectations, but it was on sale for a few pence so thought what the hell. The water effects can be cool and make it a little different from most common games.  I'm not going to loose myself in the story and it's far from perfect but It  doesn't make me want to hurt myself, and for a game that's less than the price of sandwich, why not.

												Hydrophobia is an enjoyable little game that can easily be finished in two to three hours. It's a platformer with mild shooting elements set on a floating city beseiged by Malthusian-inspired terrorists.The game is surprisingly feature rich for a small title like this, and the water effects are particularly impressive. You can open doors to flood rooms or drain them, you can use water to knock down and stun enemies, and you can also use water to overcome environmental hazards like fires or stray electrical wires. There's also a novel hacking minigame.Considering the length, I'd appraise the game at $5.00 to $7.50 at most, and anything equal to or beneath that price point is a steal. There's a plot, but it's told mainly through picked up documents. There's also a few fun little easter eggs for gamers.If you like aquatic games, platforming, and blowing people away with a sonic pistol, then I recommend you check this one out.

Posted: July 26, 2014
												If I had to sum up Hydrophobia in three words it would be ""two-thirds awesome"".  What I mean by that is that the first two acts of the game are really quite good, mixing together something that is a blend of parkour, exploration, and wonderfully detailed water physics.  It's only in the third act that things go a bit pearshaped.First though, let's talk about the good.  The most obvious is, of course, the water physics.  Oh man does this game spend a lot of time on water physics.  It flows, moves, cascades, splashes, washes over things, shows visible eddies and flows, and pushes things around as it is manipulated.  Most importantly though, your character reacts to it believably.  At no time did I feel like I was witnessing some badly out of place animation or hacky changeover from walking to swimming physics.  That also helped with the game's immersion greatly, which is good because the world presented in Hydrophobia is fairly interesting.  Though it doesn't go into much detail about the history and backround of the world, the game's areas are rich with ambiance and little touches that make it feel well designed and deep.Another tally in the good category are the game's ""puzzles"", such as they are.  While less a matter of clever puzzling and more a matter of ""find the thing you need to shoot, push, or interact with"", there's a lot of creativity involved in getting to those things sometimes. There's a clever little hacking minigame that comes up where you basically match a waveform, which is delightfully satisfying without being too easy.  More often than not it winds up being some mix of water trickery or environment climbing a la Prince of Persia, which brings me to my next good thing: your character's parkour moves.  Much like the interaction with water, at no point did I feel like I was watching some crap animations play out while my character progressed along the game's expected linear path.  Movement felt smooth, limber, agile.  The controls for all this climbing could have been explained better, but once I figured them out it was easy enough.  It's satisfying to watch too.Okay, so on to the other stuff: the bad stuff.  What's bad in this game?  The combat, mostly.  To be fair, in the first two acts it's not bad so much as just there, enemies serving more as other obstacles to get around.  The interior of the ship is littered with environmental hazards you can use to trip up enemies, which is amusing, and if you have to shoot it out with them the single gun you get is decent enough.  Where it becomes a problem though is the third act, because the third act is focused almost exclusively around combat rather than all the exploration and water puzzles you'd been getting good at.  If combat was a bit snappier and less, well, repetitive and tedious then it wouldn't be so bad.  As it is the transition makes you feel like you wandered into the wrong game by accident.With that going badly for it, the third act makes things worse by committing a few of the big no-nos of game design.  Probably the worst example I can think of is spawning more enemies in areas you just cleared as you get closer to them.  One area in particular was utterly maddening, as I would clean out the area before proceeding across a rather narrow exterior walkway, only to come around and find a guy popping into existence just in time to shotgun me in the face.  I don't mean he came out of a nearby door (there weren't any) I mean he literally appeared in a formely empty space and started shooting me.  In previous acts the additions of new waves of enemies was justified by your actions activating alarms, with said enemies coming from nearby doors.  In the third act all pretense is dropped, and the game suffers greatly for it.I can't comment on the final boss, other than to say that unlike virtually everyone else I found it ridiculously easy (water powers, throw barrel, repeat).  I do think it was a bit out of place given the rest of the game at least.  The ending is a bit abrupt - you can tell they were trying to sell this as being episodic or needing a sequel - but it at least has some resolution to it.The only other thing I can say gameplay wise is that the game's ""water powers"" are squandered in the most tragic of ways.  Though the controls are a little counterintuitive, the biggest problem is that you get them for an incredibly brief time.  While they aren't amazing, they are at least impressive, and yet I had maybe a half hour of gameplay to use them before I'd reached the end.With all of that said, I still had fun playing Hydrophobia. The core of the gameplay is fun, the story is a bit simplistic but engaging all the same, and the characters are memorable and easily likeable/hateable as appropriate.  As I said, I love the ambiance of the game, and I would enjoy seeing more content set in the same world, be it a sequel or something else.  I think I got my money's worth out of the game, but I hope that if there is a sequel the developers keep the puzzle-exploration to combat ratio a bit more consistent throughout it.

												This game is abysmal. Although it initially appears that you can at least get entertainment from how terrible the writing and acting are, the actual gameplay quickly ruins any good will you could poissbly have towards it. This is, hands down, the worst game I've ever finished and one of the worst games I've ever played. It's utterly beyond me how anyone could possibly give this mess a positive review. Pros:- 3 hours long. The tortue is brief. - The shooting and Uncharted-like platforming controls are functional. - You have a magic tablet that always knows where you should go. It suffers from Borderlands 1-esque ""walk through this mountain"" directions, but generally cancels out the poor level design. Cons:- Terrible voice acting. The main character in particular expresses almost no emotion. - Terrible story. It's your standard misguided future ecoterrorists ruining a supposed utopia. Characters appear and disappear, what should be major plot points are thrown out after two seconds of discussion, and the ending resolves absolutely nothing. A sequel was clearly planned, but never happened. - Uninteresting world. It's a boat, and almost all of it looks the same. - Constant spawn in. Enemies just appear wherever they want, particularly after you press switches. They do very little damage and die instantly to your basic, infinite rounds, which means the game is basically whack-a-mole. - Awful controls. You get the games big physics power in the last 20 minutes, and the buttons to switch to and from using it simply don't work. I had to mash the key for it up to 10 times in order to switch, which is a huge problem during a boss fight. Walking and swimming are also bad. - Poor level design. If not for the aforementioned magic tablet, this would have been a 20 hour game from me never knowing where to go. - Crap hacking minigame. Match the wave displayed on screen by waving your mouse around. - Terrible physics. Water does not work the way this game thinks it does, which is a big problem when the game is entirely based around its water physics. I had repeated issues with water flowing in to closed areas and magically not filling them or with the flow between two rooms somehow never levelling out. Once I had a roomfull of water simply disappear! The barrel physics and whatnot are pretty bad as well, which is surprising since this supposedly used Havoc. Might be collision issues with the environment. - Stability and performance. Steam vents do a number on the framerate. I had two crashes and once instance of a trigger not firing and having to restart. Hydrophobia: Prophecy is a terrible game that isn't worth your time even if you get it for free. There's no enjoyment to be had after the first half hour. If you absolutely must play with water physics today, find a bathtub.			",326,88,11,64,30,1,57

												There's a lot of little elements that make this game great however it has its rough edges.*The graphics are really good imho although the world feels a bit too bland at times but that's probably a design choice (you're on board of an ultra modern ship)*The music could be better, it's not really that memorable.*The controls feel a bit clunky at times (playing on PC with keyboard and mouse)it's easy enough to play though, but sometimes when alternating between diving & swimming at the surface & walking in deep water for example, it's kinda hard to predict your character precise movements.*The water physics are great though I feel like there is room for even more improvement (I'm not sure how realistic they are though, I'm not a liquid physician)*The story is engaging and felt original enough to me, however sometimes some elements of the gameplay could have been given a little more of a dramatic feeling. I won't say more so as not to spoil anything.*The level design is overall alright, with a good mix of action & tomb raider like jumping & stuff. However it's a total corridor game, nothing is open ended here ever.Therefore if you get this game you can turn off the ""waypoints"" option.And finally a personnal gripe : yet another game with regenerative health, I abused it though because the enemies do hurt a lot when you get surprised.I have not finished the game yet, but I would honestly like Hydrophobia 2 to come our way and in my opinion it's worth more than the 1€ I paid for it on sale.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Dark Energy Digital Ltd Publishers: Dark Energy Digital Ltd Initial release: May 2011Genre: Action, Adventure, Environment Puzzles #Worth/NotWorth: #NotWorth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationHydrophobia is a game in which attempts to evoke Under Siege mixed with Tomb Raider and brings elements from Watch Dogs and Psi-Ops.… but it does a terrible job of doing all of those things.I thought going in this would be a smaller budget title with light platforming and puzzle solving.. mostly using water. I was wrong. Its pretty much just a shooter. That wouldn't be a bad thing if it were good at that. The mechanics of shooting just barely qualify as competent. The nicest things I can say about the game are as follows:- The swimming isn't completely busted- The cut-scenes actually seem decent as if someone actually spent time on those. - There are multiple types of ammo (none of which feel good)- Its easier to tell when people are dead underwater- The game ends eventually.I have no idea what compelled me to play this until the credits were rolling. I guess mostly because I had already invested some time and Howlongtobeat.com said I didn't have much further to go. So I suffered through the injustice in the name of due diligence.The voice acting isn't awful either but its certainly far from being good. If you really like B list Sci Fi original movies then this will be right up your alley but if not just stay clear.Follow my curation for more ",1044,295,48,106,94,7,96

												this short game is no jaw-dropping , the plot is meh ,nothing new just some bad guys trying to kill other people and your mission is to stop them and game play is mediocre at best feels like an old tomb raider game , the games has some bugs especially before the end of act 3 to fix it you need to turn on the Vsync but you can forgive all cause of the nice and very reasonable price and its on sale most of the time so grab it only then 6/10			",636,174,27,75,40,8,63

												I tried. I really did. This game looked really pretty, and I'm a sucker for pretty things. It also looked like a decent platformer, which I also like.It is neither of those these. It's a buggy mess, with useless puzzles that feel more like busy work, clunky controls. I could (and tried) to soldier on to learn more about the story, but at the third act it was still... boring.

												Short and unsatisfying.For most of the storyline (a very apt estimate), water will mainly serve as a puzzle you can't directly influence.Room upon room, water is either a hazard through loose electric wires (shoot the wires - puzzle solved), a requirement to get past fire (lots of that) but rarely makes you feel like suffocating.And what about that water controlling stuff? You get it halfway Act 3 (the last act) with one trick, the water tower. Which serves for rarely anything more then heavy, uninspired lifting.The boss is even worse, it's uninspired and unsatisfying to beat it.The ending is basically a plothole. Villain defeated but the boat is still messed up with you in the thick of it, having just taken the antidote to remove your awesome powers (WHY???) .Forget magically controlling liquids, you rarely get enough time with it to appreciate it to its fullest.Hydrophobia is a water game. Sounds boring? It is boring.			",467,55,7,42,17,3,37

												After getting some much-needed post-release work, Hydrophobia: Prophecy turned into a pretty decent third-person action game. It combines light platforming, combat and puzzle elements, none particularly amazing but which work when taken as a whole. The visuals and water physics are mind-blowing at times, and the story has some philosophically interesting (if not terribly original or in-depth) overtones. I believe it was ported from XBL, so a controller might come in handy.The main drawbacks are 1) the very short length, and 2) the fact that some of the coolest stuff in the game is held out until the very end, such that you hardly get to use it. Combat isn't bad, but it's simplistic, revolving around different types of ammo fired from the same weapon. The developer having gone under means this one is probably a relic now. Still, it's a good budget title and well worth the few hours of gameplay it offers.			",226,33,10,53,16,2,45

												This game is NOT for you if you are hydrophobic. There is water in the game and lots of it and you can shoot walls to let in even more and it looks awesome, even in 2015. The water is the secret main protagonist here. The 5 hours playtime and console-style controls are satisfying. The thing is, the game ends mid story, after a mid-concluding boss fight, which is really a shame. If there ever will be a Part 2, which is actually never, I'd definitely buy it.

												This game looked like it had a lot of promise. And several mechanics enabled this: Ammo types, environment damage, puzzles that were simple but worked, good aiming and movement(minus platforming, see further on), an interesting setting and mystery. This game however suffers from a massive lack of full content leaving a primary ability you get later in the game the most short lived part of this game. It feels like this game stops at ""End of Chapter 1"" and never continues. Huge disappointment.The other thing I had insane problems with were two platforming Assassin's Creed/Uncharted/Tomb Raider spots, that required you jump from one climbing spot across a gap behind the character. The camera and controls made this near impossible and incredibly frustrating. You have to hold ‘back’ on the controls to have the character face where you want to go, but once you press ‘jump’ your character finds you still holding the ‘back’ direction so she doesn’t leap far enough forward, meaning she falls, usually to her death forcing you to restart. Luckily, instantly dying was sometimes negated in the second instance of this by landing on a surface not far enough down to instantly kill the character, but you’d still have to climb all the way back up to try again… and fail.If these guys ever expand this game into a full story, and get rid of or fix the stupid platforming crap then this game would be worth a full $60 bucks as a real AAA game. But for now, pick it up on sale and spend a few minutes playing and then never play it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hydrophobia:  Prophecy (Dark Energy Digital, 2011)I've completed Hydrophobia: Prophecy and had a great time doing so.  It's true that this was originally meant to be the first game in a trilogy, that it had major problems upon release, that the rest of the trilogy was scrapped and a new version of this game created that incorporated (some) content from what were meant to be the follow-ups, and that it has since appeared dirt cheap in numerous bundled deals and on Steam.  But don't let any of that distract you from what is now, today, a polished product that is genuinely fun to play.In short, Hydrophobia:  Prophecy is an action-adventure game with strong platforming elements, set on a huge ocean liner, or rather in the bowels of a huge ocean liner.  The gameplay is fairly standard.  You are able to shoot, with a variety of different projectiles at your disposal, but it's not a shooter by any stretch.The level design is great, the controls work, defeating enemies and overcoming environmental challenges feel satisfying, and as mentioned above, the price is likely to be right regardless of where you choose to buy it.SCORESGraphics - 82 %Water effects are brilliant;  the main character has terrible hair though (plastic dreadlocks on what is otherwise a gorgeous model), which I found somewhat distracting throughout.Sound - 70 %It works;  nothing particularly noteworthy though.Execution - 75 %The game, in this iteration, is a good execution of its core concept.  The storytelling via cinematics and viewscreens placed around the ship is effective.  You dislike the bad guys;  though sadly their politics are never as deeply explored as it could have been (likely owing to the trilogy being scrapped).  The free running-style gameplay and acrobatics work and never pose any problems, such as unexpected falls or missing jumps because of problematic surface detection.  One does feel that the setting (a huge ocean liner) could have been more interestingly presented, and it doesn't feel all that much like you're inside a huge ship on the ocean (regardless of copious amounts of water).  Again, it is likely that this concept was originally meant to be explored further.  The water manipulation powers from later in the game also feel a bit tacked on, as they obviously were, considering they weren't meant to be in the first episode at all.Addictiveness - 80 %I wanted to continue playing, and I did, and I pursued some achievements, and I enjoyed myself.  That sentence has about two ""ands"" too many, but hey, the game is a bit like that.  You never know if you're close to the end and you don't really care.  It's fun getting there, and that's mainly what matters (in my opinion).Overall - 75 %It's cheap.  It's good.  Buy it if you're into third-person exploration games with some shooting and a lot of acrobatics.  The achievements all appear to work, which I know is important to some people.  There are collectables, again, if that is your sort of thing.  I just wanted a thrilling experience with an unsual setting, and I got what I wanted.  I'm looking forward to doing another playthrough at some point.  And that's really the best recommendation there is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The water looks fantastic, and there are a lot of really good elements to this game, but there are some unfortunate killer flaws that bring me to not recommend it.The first and most important issue is there is a point in the game you simply can not go past due to a design issue.  Forums indicate that this is somewhat random and may be passable by messing with video settings.  The problem there is your card/driver/settings should never impact the mechanics of the game, and the issue is a jump that can't be made due to distance.  Very odd, and it was the nail in the coffin for this one.Up until that point I almost had to stop playing it several times because the number one way the game lives up to it's name is by making you sea sick.  The camera follow is abysmal, whipping around randomly as you go in and out of water, up and down from ladder to platform, and even just trying to swim around under water.  The violent thrashing of the camera, and some times inability to look past a very confined point when you need to look around is just terrible.Had those two issues been addressed in the years since release, it would at least be an enjoyable play with some engaging visuals.  It has a good balance of strategic shooter and light puzzle solver familiar to other games of the genre.Past that however, you note a couple other problems.  For one, it's very short.  Given what I read from those who were able to play the whole game, the killer point I mentioned is quite near the end.  That means the total play time is 4 hours or less.  Also, while they clearly had a great back story to the game world, very little of it is shared in the game.  This leads you to feel lost while things are being talked about in a very matter of fact way.  While not entirely unusual in similar games, the fact that bad guys just appear out of nowhere with no reason (didn't come in by door, just popped up) is off putting.  It's also quite obvious the bad guys must have gills, because unlike you they can stay under water indefinitely.  There is also the matter of the water control powers.  Apparently you get those right at the end, so I never got to experience them, but saving something like that for the last 20 minutes of the game?  Odd choice in my opinion.  In the end, other than the sea sickness there really is never a sense of fear of the water, which makes one wonder if there was an element the developers just failed to convey given the implied back story.All told, if you take a sea sick pill and get the game on a super steam sale for $1, it will pass a couple hours, and how hard can you complain for $1?  Well, I guess about as hard as this review...			",94,11,0,16,6,0,32

HYDROPHOBIA: PROPHECY3rd person action/survival-adventure gameRating 2/10Interesting premise with nice water effects let down by clunky gameplay, bland locations and terrible voice acting.It should be quite good, the idea of fighting terrorists who have hijacked a floating city whilst trying to overcome hull breaches and numerous fires. Sadly even though the water looks fantastic and creates a few genuine moments of panic as rooms fill with water the rest of the gameplay falls short.  The worst of these is the gun play. It's a real chore and it feels like you're fighting the controls more than the terrorists. Thankfully they aren't that often but they undermine the rest of the game. The voice acting and writing isn't much better, lifeless and wooden which doesn't help the repetitive and boring gameplay of collecting keys to open a series of identical doors.They have great water tech, they just don't have a great game to go with it.

I played this game for a lets play series and although the middle was entertaining, the beginning and end of the game (especially the last 5 minutes) are infuriating. I had to change a video setting because it SOMEHOW determined whether or not I made a jump.If you REALLY want to check the game out, go ahead.

Hydrophobia is an unsatisfying but engagingly short tense experience throughout.In this, we follow a young woman on a dangerous quest to escape a hijacked ship which then leads to unpredictable and intriguing outcomes through the true conspiracy. Though the main villain's reasons could be politically challenged, it's however a rather terrifying and eyeopening perspective on the instinct humans have for survival and balancing economical causes. At times, the protagonist and additional characters are tolerable but unfortunately lack enough depth to be totally memorable.The toughest gripe about this video game is purely knowing and literally seeing the potential spread between the mess that's the length and shortcomings within the story. It's either presenting itself as a disjointed short cinematic film purposely filled with unanswered questions or what would become a bloated adventurous game had it been thoroughly developed with care. Various things were heavily underutilized to an extent and would've given it a broader identity had there been various adjustments. There's particular creative sequences that surprisingly twists expectations but are merged between some tedious ideas that could either downgrade the enjoyment or levitate the replay value.Although its promising material was abruptly underdeveloped, it's definitively a self-destructive antique that shouldn't be lost or forgotten within the abyss of video game history.

												I bought this game a long time ago when I saw it on sale for next-to-nothing.  I was really shocked at the quality in this super-budget title!In the game you play a female protagonist in her linear adventure in a floating city. She is led through the bowels of the city's utility systems by a male co-worker who speaks in her earpiece.  He is watching most everything you do via the many security cameras in the city.  The exchanges are quite humorous now and then (and one time VERY humorous!).  The city is under attack from a villianess-of-the-week and her many rent-a-thugs.The game has controls similar to the Tomb Raider reboot although not quite as polished.  It also has Batman Arkham Assylum Detective vision for solving some simple puzzles.  The game also throws in some Half-Life 2 styled electricity and water puzzles.The thing that impressed me the most in this game are the water physics.  If the developer is reading this, my hat is off to you my friend.  The water physics are -=AMAZING=-!  The best I have seen in ANY videogame!Gun combat is not great but passable.  Fortunately this little missy is very tough and can take quite a few hits.  Combat in flooded rooms adds a new dimension as enemies are difficult to see on the other side of the water's surface.  I was frequently diving and surfacing to keep up with the enemies as they appeared above and below the water-line.I have not finished the game but I believe I am very close.  It is a short game, maybe 8 hours.  I read in the forums the final boss fight is a pain.PROS:+ -=Excellent=- value for your money.+ Novel gunplay situations in flooded areas.+ Varied gameplay from platforming to combat to environmental puzzles.+ THE FREAKING WATER PHYSICS!  Holy crap it is amazing!!+ Occasionally amusing banter between the main characters+ Documents and objects to collect along the way if you are into that.+ Graphics are quite good for a budget title.CONS:- Platforming is a little rough around the edges.  Character animations are a little stiff at times.- Environments can get a little samey as you make your way through the maintinence chambers under the city (where most of the game takes place).- While the main character looks nice, some of the other character models do not look so good.- Some of the environmental (Half Life 2 style) puzzles will test your patience.  These just aren't as fun as they were in the mid-2000's.The game is not perfect, but the value you get for the price is outstanding.  It would be worth a go at twice the asking price.  If you enjoyed the Tomb Raider reboot, this game is a no-brainer!			",316,43,29,12,17,3,21

												Do you want to be an all-powerful water mage fighting a one woman war on eco-terrorists? Then this game may just be for you.I started playing this game with low hopes but was surprised at times and disappointed at others. There were of course a few fun things and a couple of moments that stood out above the rest as memorable. At the begining I really enjoyed myself yet it was mostly downhill from there. The water mechanics and powers later on were awesome to play with. But for the most part this game was meh.The combat is bland and forgetful, the weapons for the most part were serviceable and the supernatural abilities, although fun to use, only come into play towards the very end of the game. Also the plot, from what little there was, appeared rushed and had a very weak payoff. I wouldn’t recommend this game at full price, but at the low low sale price of 47 pence or 60 cents then there are worse things you can buy.Have fun. ^_^ ",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												Hydrophobia is ultimate a tech demo for the realistic water system with particle physics, fluid dynamics (or simulation thereof), and beautiful graphics. You play ""Kate"", a system engineer on the Queen of the World, a floating arcology (giant floating city) that was being attacked by nihilistic terrorists who want to unleash a nanobot plague and kill all the humans so the planet can start anew. As Kate, you survive, hack your way through the ship surviving various challenges such as fire,electricity, and water. Kate's spelunking, cliff-climbing experience comes in handy as she climbs, jumps and swims through various levels while combating these terrorists who wants to annihilate mankind. The game gets extremely buggy near the end, with disappearing objects and disappearing bosses. It is short (I finished in merely a few hours, and I'm a slow player) and it is an experience, albeit, probably not one that needs to be repeated.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												""Hydrophobia"" is a action - adventure indie game by a developer called ""Dark Energy Digital"" and published by ""Microsoft Studios"". It uses the ""Hydro engine"" for some excellent dynamic water effects   In the story mode you play as a female protagonist ""Kate willson"". The opening cut scene indicates that she has a bad experince with the water, but the mejority of the gameplay is set only in the water and charecter doesn't seem to have any problem with that. Besides this narrative - gameplay disconnection the setting is quite intresting. You will also get water manipulating powers, but pretty late in the game. there is a main antagonist mila who leads a group of solders called ""Malthusians"". Let's not spoil the story over here for those who haven't played the game yet.   As in the case of gameplay, it's a generic 3rd person cover based shooter with some boring platforming and puzzle solving. It's mediocre at the best, but the game really shines in graphics department. It maynot be a lookup now, but for a 2011 indie game it's really well designed. As told before it has some best quality looking water effects. Hydro engineis capable of dynamic water flowing, which means the water in the game will act like real water and will consume empty spaces. Don't expect any crysis level detail or rendering, but the environments are quite nicely done. as far as the voice and music is concerned it is sitly above average.since it's a indie game, can't complain much abot that.   he game's narration leaves more question than it answers, and it is really a short game. "" 4 hours "", that's all you need to complete the game. The additional challenge mode is fun for first 2-3 times only. so if the game is on sale it's a definate buy, but for the full price just ignore it. I am supporting the game only because i want to see a prequel or a sequel fleshing out the idea's of the original game. For me this setting has a lot of potential and it pains me that it is getting wasted like this. Since the developer closing doors in 2011, my will be a wish only. i hope it won't be the case			",57,3,1,8,2,0,1

												Primary conclusion: Best bought for game research/curiosity and little else. It's only an average third-person shooter, with an unfortunately short-lived exploration of a unique mechanic (water manipulation, towards the end of the game). Sell a few Steam cards, nab it during a sale, jump in with low expectations and enjoy a few hours of fairly impressive water simulation whilst shooting suicidal baddies (no really, that's their whole gig, convincing people to kill themselves, you'll see it all throughout the game, not advised if suicidal).The good attempts:Dynamic environmental element. Remember the old firefighting games? Replace fire with water then briefly give you control over it, that's Hydrophobia.Charming dialogue. While it doesn't do it very well, at least it tried something a little more lighthearted and fun compared to some other games.Emphasis on environmental awareness. Not in the save the world propaganda, but in keeping an eye out for electrical wires and the standard explosive tanks sitting about. It was nice that these options were available and encouraged through the unusual point system.Scan/MAVI view. This was a neat little trick to hide stuff in the environment without it being terribly obvious, and could have been used better, but where it was used, it was alright. With a longer game and better level design, it might have been better.The bad attempts: Voice acting. This wasn't the worst, but it was absolutely along mediocre lines. The main character, who with more development might have proved interesting, was especially average. Her partner in crime, Scoot, was somewhat better, but not by much.Platforming. This is probably the most offensively poor part of the game, I think. When it works properly, it's passable, but when it fails due to needing to be very precise, it's just frustrating. Fortunately there were only maybe three spots that made this especially noticeable in the game, but that's three too many, in my book.Game length. I'm not sure how this game's development went, if it was extended over and over to get the water simulation down or what, but the end result was much too short and the most unique gameplay element introduced way too late. Even trying to find everything in the game in a single pass (which to be fair I didn't manage), I beat it in about 4 hours. For $5 that's not too bad, and on sale for $.50 that's especially okay, but you probably won't find yourself replaying it. ",176,45,2,17,15,1,35

												Hydrophobia is a game that promised to have the most amazing water engine, and boy does it deliver. The story is pretty interesting but the way the water effects combat, physics and even the way it behaves and interacts is so amazing. The rag dolls are nothing to sneeze at and it has some interesting mechanics. Ill put it this way, what Halflife is to gravity physics Hydraphobia is to water physics. Its well worth buying and I've yet to see a game that comes close to this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL;DR:I believe this is a very solid game and absolutley think I got my moneys worth out of it.And I'd really like to see a sequel.Pros:So the water, it's effects and how movements are in it look and feel stunningly real!Runs really smooth even on my several year old laptop even though you have all theese water effects.Overall graphics are great.Sound and music is OK.Story is OK.Level Design is nice, even though pretty linear.Puzzles are OK, pretty straight forward and not hard thinkabouters.You can make choices (sometimes have to be quick about them) wheter to save someone or leave them to their fate.Really like the MAVI (Mobile Automated Visual Interface) and what you can do with it!You are like a smart commando triathlon acrobat; Climbing, swimming, balancing, rolling, swinging, jumping, shooting, hacking and everything else you're friggin' amazing at!Really awesome nanotech water ability!Cons:Controls are... OK, but they feel a little clunky.Animations sometimes (not at all always) felt a bit stiff, most apparent during cutscenes.Journal entries (who seems to be quite alot about what the protagonist feels and wants) and speech isn't always reflecting each other that well.Map in the MAVI was not that easy to follow (not that you had to look at it since there wasn't many places to go except forward).Sometimes while climbing, you get a fixed camera angle.You can't always look in the direction you want, seems like the water and other objects can block the camera so you can't look up for example (unless ou use the MAVI)).Sometimes the camera angle makes it so you can't see enemies while they can still shoot at you.If you stand to close to the edge of ventilation shafts, you will start to drift/float out of the vent shaft and fall down.So many collectibles it get's a bit tideous. Especially when some of them doesn't add anything ( IEY! I found a jar of pills that I can... uh, ok, just look at?).The choises you make doesn't seem to have any impact on the story... but it gives you a 'Medal' (yet another collectible)!Replay value; I'd say not that great unless you're an achievement junkie.Not to spoil it too much, but I found it a bit sad that I didn't get to play around with the water abilities more.Connclusion:First off I have to say that I was impressed with the water.How it moved and what you could do with it.Also I really liked the MAVI for some reason. It however was a tiny hard navigated/find the correct button for at first (my fault for not looking up the controls in the options menu) and the map in it wasn't maybe that easy to follow.But it was some fun elements used with it. Hacking security cameras, finding hidden messages etc.I would have wanted to have a longer campaign......and also I might have quite a list of cons...Still however;I believe this is a very solid game and absolutley think I got my moneys worth out of it.Maybe because I played on Hard without the permanent objective marker. Plus I also at first tried to run around everywhere getting all objects and documents so it might have taken me a little longer that some.And I'd really like to see a sequel.Maybe with a little more polish to some of the cons above and I'd probably say it would be worth quite a bit more that what they charge for this baby....but sadly seems like the studio has been shut down, but I still hope that someday this title will re-emerge to the surface for us all to enjoy.

												I want to say that I liked this game, I really did. It was beautiful, had a somewhat interesting story and many of the ideas in it were really cool. Then I got to the last bit of the game and it just went downhill. The water manipulation abilites are difficult to use and the final/only boss battle was pretty much impossible because of that. I ended up never finishing the game because of that, and honestly I think this was the first game I never finished for an actual reason; which is pretty sad.TLDR: Beautiful and interesting story and gameply ideas, bad powers and ridiculous final boss.

												If you can pick up a copy for a couple of cheap trading cards, go for it. Other than that, not worth it.The water physics are FANTASTIC, it's how the game sells. Absolutely gorgeous, but once the novelty wears off, you're left with a shell of a game that hides behind its water-based engine. Gameplay leaves much to be desired, and like another said, cutscene galore. I mean, holy cutscenes batman, but it's better than me dying for the same stupid reason that shouldn't be an issue in the first place.Its a fun concept. The water could not have been done better. But thats where it stops. Don't even think about paying less than 75% of retail unless you bleed money.			",97,15,7,7,15,1,10

												This game is TERRIBLE! Not only is the campaign short and very, very stupid. The voice actors put no effort into their job in this game, all the characters sounded lame. The graphics of this game are also terrible, when i went through a door to a new room, the map textures were nowhere to be found and it took a solid 10 seconds for the map to load. The How To Play and the actual controls were completely different to each other, as in the How To Play would say ""C"" to drop down from ledges, whereas the controls say ""Q"". This game is also not straight forward like it should be. The worst game I have ever played in my life. If you're smart you WILL NOT get this game. ",228,31,3,22,7,3,17

												This isn't great, but given the low price it is an OK game about escaping the ower decks of a sinking ship for a few hours. Pretty simplistic, with a few hiccups, but has at least the foundation of an interesting background story. Some details are worked out pretty well - some others... not so much. There's no crafting, no character advancement, no skill trees. Lots of swimming and diving, though, which gives this game somewhat of a twist. Controls work moderately well on the PC, graphics are starting to show their age, but still ok.			",1093,283,50,175,93,5,291

												Nothing out of the ordinary to see here. No, really.You're Kate. You're, as I understand it, stationed on a HUGE ship of some description and this ship gets attacked by terrorists. Your goal is to fend off these men and save the day. A pretty standard third person shooter with a LOT of swimming - so if you like swimming in games, I guess this is something for you to play.Considering that I got the game for about €1, I can't really say that it's a bad game. But one thing is for certain - it is NOT optimized. In some places the game's FPS dropped from 60 to below 20. Made the game unplayable. Second, when I was trying to defeat the final boss, the game decided to crash - froze up entirely - on me. Not once, not twice... five times in total. That was pretty frustrating.It was okay. If you've got some hours to kill, go for it.			",489,140,8,67,38,6,70

												As one of the first games in my steam library, this game got ignored for quite a while, but I have finally completed it. Hydrophobia Prophecy will take you around 3 hours to complete (I played an hour and lost my original save). Some people are annoyed by short games but I was happy to have a quick little romp so I can move on to other titles in my library. I think this game gets more hate than it deserves. It has fantastic audio engineering, really cool graphics with all of the water effects, and a story interesting enough to keep you playing. I did have some minor complaints with the game, but for the few bucks you can buy it for they really aren't that big of a deal. -PR0XIDIAN			",913,138,59,85,56,7,110

												This game is often on sale for $0.99 or less, and at that price, I think it is definitely worth it. There are a lot of negative reviews for this game, and they aren't entirely wrong, but I don't think it's a terrible game. It has its ups and its downs and a full load of meh. So, let's break it down. Warning: Minor spoilers, but nothing that really gives away the story.Positives: - The water physics: they are definitely cool and a major positive. I wish more games would make such use of flowing water physics to affect the characters and environment. It is fun to use water flooding to disorient your enemies and sweep them off their feet, it's neat how the intensity, direction, and depth of the water flow affect your own movement and so on. In some cases, you can see flooded compartements behind glass barriers, and if you shoot out the glass, that water floods into an area to have several effects. Similarly, some destructable leaky bulkheads can be shot out for similar effects, in some areas even completely filling the corridors and compartments you are in, which can be a danger but finding an air-pocket is usually not too hard.- Use of the environment as weapons: not just the water, but leaky gas pipes, explosive panels and barrels, electrical panels and wires... all can be used strategically to trap and take out groups of bad guys.- The ""Mavi"" device: I found the way you can use it to scan and control somethings in the environment as well as see invisible messages and such pretty nifty. Not awesome, mind you, but cool enough.Negatives: - The voice acting: it's very weak, and I'll be surprised if you don't find the main character's voice to be whiny and annoying. - The keyboard and mouse controls: if you play this game, you'll definitely want to do it with a controller. Controlling with a keyboard and mouse is just really wonky. It's not perfect with a gamepad but it is much better and will save you a lot of frustration, especially later in the game when it comes to controlling water.- The final boss battle is pretty terrible and frustrating until you figure out what to do. It's darned near impossible with keyboard/mouse controls.The meh:- The story is really weak. It wanted to be something good, but the writers didn't pull it off well.- The gameplay in general. It's not terrible but it isn't very good either. It tries to combine a lot of things: cover-based shooting, tomb-raider style climbing and platforming, and a bit of ""magic"" in the form of a nanobot infection giving you the ability to somewhat control the water. But it doesn't do any of these these things particularly well. - The challenge room is pretty dull (unlocked upon completing the game), and the gameplay is not good enough to make it much fun. Only worth playing if you must go for 100% achievements. This game doesn't do a lot, so don't expect a lot. It wanted to be something amazing and utterly failed at that, but there is fun to be had.  I think you can easily get several hours of enjoyment out of it for $0.99 when it's on sale, but don't go in with high expectations and you won't find yourself being too disappointed. Again, playing it with a controller is pretty much a must.			",380,74,10,28,16,1,21

												tl;dr: Play this for... awesome water effects, nice atmosphere and story, varied gameplayAccept... controls that are a little fiddly sometimes, especially during shootouts (gamepad)Be prepared... for the plot to rush to a sudden, pretty unsatisfiying ending from a certain point---First, look and physics of the water are simply incredible and contribute a lot to the nice atmosphere of the game. I was really impressed especially by the movement of the water and the fluent (haha...) way the character reacts to it. This game includes climbing passages (solid and fun), cover mechanic shootouts (a little fiddly sometimes), some riddles (rather easy, but some are original) and more... Overall game duration does not offer enough time to exploit the potential of all gameplay mechanics (e.g. different ammunition types are almost irrelevant)I play games like this primarily for the story, but attach a lot of value on gameplay and controls. Controls feel a little clumsy in certain situations, but are fine overall.The plot starts out and evolves nicely ... up to one point. Then all of a sudden the story kind of collapses and then rushes to a sudden end, leaving a lot unanswered. This felt really disappointing and left me very unsatisfied. However, remembering the early phases of the game I still recommend this game for its atmosphere, water effects and varied gameplay.			",72,40,2,12,4,1,4

												As one of the first games in my steam library, this game got ignored for quite a while, but I have finally completed it. Hydrophobia Prophecy will take you around 3 hours to complete (I played an hour and lost my original save). Some people are annoyed by short games but I was happy to have a quick little romp so I can move on to other titles in my library. I think this game gets more hate than it deserves. It has fantastic audio engineering, really cool graphics with all of the water effects, and a story interesting enough to keep you playing. I did have some minor complaints with the game, but for the few bucks you can buy it for they really aren't that big of a deal. -PR0XIDIAN			",913,138,59,85,56,7,110

												I paid $0.49 for this game and that's probably what it's worth.  The water effects are beautiful but the plot is thin and the gameplay is very repetitive,  The environment is very uniform, so without the little arrows telling you where to go you'd get immediately lost; but the arrows totally spoil any immersion that you might feel and it isn't always clear where they want you to go anyway.  All this I could forgive, but ... what ruins the game is that there is no proper save system and it crashes quite often, losing the automatically saved checkpoints, and forcing you to replay a large part of the game before you can move forward.

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy is a 1 of a kind game thats for sure. Simply put it's a very short game that can be comfortably completed with in 2-5 hrs, so dont expect too much for your buck. Don't get me wrong with me saying that, I still found it fun to a degree with its water physic element.Is it worth $5, that would depend if your a full on game collector. Personally I would grab it on special.The game itself has a great concept and Idea, with a Sci-Fi feel and an Action RPG element to it and can leave an opening to a great series, mods, etc...The only way I can describe this game, it is like playing Tomb Raider 1-3 with the puzzle aspect to it, Metal Gear Solid 1 & 2 with the weapon changing also with a Mass Effect FOV movement feel.StoryWell the stoyline is very basic, your on a ship and a group of terrorist has taken over and killing innocents to claim a product that is made on the ship. They want to use it as a weapon and take over the world. You and a work collegue are working together as a team to stop them while the ship is sinking and hacking into computer systems, doors, etc.. just to try and stay 1 step ahead of the terrorist.LikesGame concept and has potential to expand.Didnt mind the movie scenes.Graphics was alright for its time.KB/M or Controller setup was ok and workable but could be better.DislikesFound the voice acting very bland and the constant whiney voice started to get annoying after a while.Very little dialog and variety.Too Short.Music found very boring and not thrilling. (Sounded like a B grade James Bond style movie playing in the background).Shooting in general the hit boxes are a hit and miss.Boss fight is a real disapointment with the hit boxes and movement of the barrels to strike.IssuesIMPORTANT: High end PC's be sure to have VSYNC turned on when playing this game otherwise you wont be able to jump and leap from place to place. The game does sit comfortably at 50-60 FPS depending on your system.Sound occasionaly cuts in and out.Personal Rating: 7/10			",253,19,11,27,3,3,7

												Hydrophobia is a puzzle/action/platformer akin to games like Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia, Legacy of Kain and countless other titles that we have probably played at one point or another. It's extremely atmospheric and it's got great visualizations (particularly the water effect- no kidding, right?) and sound. Here's the break down:THE GOOD: Stuff I liked.1. The WaterThe water is, as the name implies, the cornerstone of this game. It is the reason for the game's interesting atmosphere and environment based puzzles. The physics, graphics and visualizations (movement of waves, transition from surface to underwater, water on camera, etc) are superb. Best water effects I've seen in a game. Period.2. The Environment Interaction/ MovementI really enjoyed the layout of the levels and their design in general. There was a decent mix of swimming and climbing, giving each zone a level of depth that I don't often notice in other games (save for some of the ones I mentioned previously). Or maybe it's just because I was actually able to interact with it to such a high degree that made it interesting. This includes shooting out glass doors, blasting through bulkheads and raising the ambient water level. Very cool experience.3. NAVI MechanicI really enjoyed the NAVI mechanic. The protagonist comes equipped with a transparent PDA gadget that acts as your GUI in the game, keeping all your notes, grants access to your in game menus, highlights secret messages in the game and enables you to do all your non-combat trickery (hacking, opening doors, etc). 4. PRICE!!! $$$!!I think I bought the game on sale for $0.50? So in the end it was money well spent. ^_^The BAD: Stuff that was 'Meh.'1, Clunky MovementSo, while you can do all this neat stuff like roll, climb, swim and cling to cover... the controls felt somewhat unresponsive. Often I'd lose the ability to shoot around cover and have to back off and re-cling to get it working again. Likewise, occasionally the game would ignore a command to dive, roll, or jump. The fact that it occurred sporadically made it that much more of an aggravation when these missed commands would pop up... particularly in a heated, combat situation!2. *Occasional* Camera Angles from HellAgain, these didn't happen very often but when they did it was really difficult to get out of them. It most often happened while swimming and most usually in tight corridors. Of course, this is typically a problem of any game with a high degree of mobility in a given environment. 3. BacktrackingI don't mind a whole lot of backtracking personally. Given the NAVI's ability to help you perceive new things in the environment and the changing level of water, I'd rank this game about equal with such games as Legacy of Kain and Chrono Trigger. OF COURSE, there's backtracking... the designers want to show you how a place has changed. So I don't think it's a problem, but a lot of other reviews did. 4. 'Easy' Combat...?I played the game on Normal mode and died a total of 2 (maybe 3?) times while in combat. The badguy AI is fairly responsive in my opinion: when you don't shoot at it, they sneak closer to you. When you do, they scramble for cover. They try to flank you, etc, etc. They don't do any of this quickly, but they do it. They also deal enough damage that you can't go barreling in guns blazing very often either. But, if you're like me and you rock the sneaky/cautious/clever game style, you'll probably breeze through the game since there's ample opportunity for you to use environmental hazards to your advantage. This is NOT Call of Duty, Counterstrike, or anything resembling a ""real"" shooter. It just happens you can shoot things. 5. Voice ActingI've seen a lot of bad reviews because of voice acting... but honestly, I've heard a LOT worse (none come to mind this instant, but we've all heard worse). Plus, there's not a whole lot of it. I actually think the worst voice acting comes mainly from the protagonist (which is unfortunate) because I thought the acting of the antagonist and your plucky tech support ally were decent enough (if not reading from a very unimaginative script). THE UGLY: Stuff that's unforgivable (imho). In order,1. Repetitive game play and goals. The whole game is about finding keys to locked doors, almost without exception. This sucks. I'm just glad the environment was fun to navigate to make me forget that this was all I was doing. Blah. 2. Very few upgrades/collectables/etc. You pick up about 3 'new' abilities that you use sporadically throughout the game. There was also about 6 different types of ammo you could collect... but you really never needed it until the end of the game. This is one extremely crucial difference between this game and the likes Legacy of Kain and Prince of Persia (also games like Metroid, Castlevania and Megaman)… you never really feel like your power level advances.There is one HUGE exception to this complaint however, which brings me to...3. INCREDIBLY SHORT GAME!The final and coolest upgrade you get in the whole game is discovered and unlocked LITERALLY minutes before the game ends at the one and only boss fight. Not only is it a cruel move to throw a new game mechanic at you without giving you sufficient time to practice using it, but you also don’t get to enjoy it for more than a few minutes! Unforgivable! >_<Overall, if you can snag this game for less than the price of a bottle soda at the gas station AND have a few hours to kill, you may as well pry what fleeting joy you can from it’s very beautiful, if somewhat flawed and arthritic fingers.

												This game looks promising, and could have potential, but ends up wasting what it has with clunky controls and with just how short the game is.First off, the good points. The graphics are very good, especially the water and the way it flows between rooms. The near-future sci-fi setting is above-average and shows quite a bit of promise.Unfortunately, the bad points significantly outweight the good for this game. The controls need quite a bit of work. For simply walking around they're fine, but the jumping controls are extremely spotty. I died far too many times because the character wouldn't jump or would jump the wrong direction. Also, the cover system doesn't work consistenly (won't always go into cover when you need it, randomly can't shoot around corners, sometimes randomly jumps out of cover) which makes some of the firefights later in the game quite frustrating.The sci-fi setting, as interesting as it is, is woefully underutilized. The game supposedly takes place on a floating city, but you never actually see it (the quick glimpse out the window at the beginning notwithstanding). For all I know this could be in a secret underwater base or in tunnels deep below a conventional city.The water powers are a cool concept, but the clunky controls combined with the fact that you don't actually get them until almost the end of the game and that there is only really one power was a big letdown since it was one of the selling points of the game for me.Finally, the biggest weakness of this game is just how short it is. I blew through it in 4 hours without a walkthrough and with dying a significant number of times due to the controls. There is no closure on the story (unless it's in a hidden video after the credits). Sure, you stop the bad guys, but what happens to the city?I feel like the concepts behind this game are solid, the setting and the basic gameplay ideas are spot on, but the poor execution and lack of content really hurts this game.Unfortunately this game is from 2011 and it's been a long time since the last update so I'm not confident that there will be any further improvements. Not recommended.			",549,183,19,71,76,4,115

												This a great game. A true spectacle. It can be taken as an allegory: an ""Animal Farm"", ""1984"", and ""Slaughterhouse Five"" of its time. This game is only a whopping seventy four cents because Steam feels everybody should have the opportunity to play this masterpiece. Because, history will only repeat itself if we do not heed the warnings present in this game. World War III will erupt with nations fighting over ideologies and oil. I ask, not for myself, but for our generation and many more to come, that you please purchase this game. There is no multiplayer because the developers are sending the message that in the new world, nobody can save you, but yourself.			",192,15,4,12,4,1,2

												I finished this game to get my money's worth, but it's not even worth it free.  It's not worth the emotional trauma because everything about it is terrible.  Terrible story, terrible characters, terrible voice acting, awful controls and pointless time trials.  I even encountered a bug where the final boss won't spawn lol. Thankfully the reload point wasn't too far off.  The final boss battle was very frustrating and gave no sense of satisfaction once it was over.The only good thing about this is of course the water physics.  Next time I want to see good water physics, I'll go to the beach instead. Lesson learned, not all 90% off games are worth buying!			",144,70,4,25,22,3,12

												You can now (07/03/2014) save 90% on this gem! I believe you should all proceed as you're not gonna regret it!Dark Energy's Hydrophobia is an action-adventure game that takes place in an underwater city. This is what the game's antagonists (terrorists) are trying to get rid of by placing bombs at several places to have it completely destroyed by water.Now, here comes the interesting part: Kate, the girl you control, can manipulate water. While you have the usual cover-shoot-cover-style gameplay you also have the option to move water - this looks and feels amazing thanks to the technology incorporated in the game that makes sure handling water is as fluid and dynamic as possible.The game can be difficult at times and being an indie game it does not have top-notch voice-acting. Also, being an indie game it is rather short - doing a complete walkthrough can be managed in 3 or 4 hours. Nevertheless, I recommend this game especially due to the regular discount it receives - another proof why we should look for some indie titles in between those AAA titles.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												This game wasn't bad at all and the game really focuses on water effects and how it acts. Just like how it was in Bioshock. The game keeps you moving along and it can get directionally challenging to find your way sometimes. There is an in game map and its a 3D modeling of the complex your in. There is lots of voice acting in the game and your computer pad screen that you use like xray scanning around the area to find codes and messages help you to find your way point for where to go.Overall the game isn't bad and somewhat interesting, when it goes on sale for around $2.49 its worth picking up.

												I'd like to think there was a really grat idea... that was just never fully realized, or they just didn't quite know how they wanted to effectively pull it off. See, it's one thing to advertise a game with having an ability, but it's another to save this until the last chunk of the game. There are some well implemented ideas, unfortunately, none of which go well with what the intended vision might have been. Combat mechanics are awkward, some of the controls a tad unresponsive, and you're never completely clear on exactly how you're supposed to accomplish certain tasks. Oh, and you'll likely die a lot from trial and error trying to either figure out how to solve a puzzle, or drowning. Usually the latter.I like the cover mechanics, although it's probably best to stick with the Sonic Rounds, since not only are they the highest accuracy, but they also don't have ammo, and you charge them. And you can use them underwater. Of course, your enemies can use shotguns underwater... which is kind of cheap if you ask me.I wouldn't say this is a terrible game, as there are elements that do work... sort of, but I probably wouldn't recommend this, unless they decided they really, really wanted to try this.[SPOILERS]Now... if they had allowed you to use your ""waterbending"" powers a lot sooner, like say... I dunno, before the end of the first act, I think it could have easily been a much better game. Alas, that's not the case, and unfortunately, there's only a few short segments where you can try out your new powers, and it's incredibly short lived. Plus the ending is kind of like they were trying to close it as quickly as possible. It's awkward.			",348,37,7,40,9,0,34

												Having bought this for $2 or somesuch ages ago, I'm stunned at how good this game is. The flaws -- mostly m+kb control-related for me -- need no pointing out, and were apparently pretty glaring on first release, but it was expanded and improved, and I'll list the high points that really stand out for me:1) Story and plot development. The slow way the player is introduced to the world of HP is just fantastic. No big cinematic intro or information dump on who your character is or where you are, and it's only through small details like pictures or found documents that some background is unveiled. When the bombs start going off, you're just as clueless as your character, rushing around to put out the next fire or repair a sub-system. I'm really impressed with how well the plot unrolled, how involved I became with the character, and still think about the unanswered questions.2) Graphics and water effects. Great stuff. Much of the gameplay revolves around the excellent and ever-present water effects, and I became just as anxious as the character about drowning.3) The 'Mavi' device; what a nice in-game tool: A tablet-like device that your character holds up, and that displays an enhanced wireframe view of your surroundings, with objectives and points-of-interest highlighted. An intuitive and well-designed HUD element, that's only there when your character deploys it; every time I used it I congratulated the devs on thinking it up.Well, those are enough. For $2 & a short 7 hour campaign, there's more than enough reasons to give Hydrophobia Prophecy some attention. Runs fine under Win8.			",224,69,9,14,11,0,16

If you answered yes to either of the first two questions then this is the game for you! If you answered yes to the third question, please let me know what game has realistic water physics other than this one, because I have never found another game with this much detail that doesn't lose performance with the water physics. This game has had a special place in my heart, ever since I first discovered it on Xbox 360 back before I had a PC. I highly recommend this game!FYI:If you were wondering about why I only have 3 hours in this game, that is because the entire game is beatable in that short of a time period. However it does have a free-mode where you can play a sort of wave survival gamemode and really play with the water physics!			",478,123,3,44,41,2,18

												HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELL NO!This game boasted so many incredible things, it got websites hyped the ♥♥♥♥ UP!What we got instead was a lumbering mess of stupidity. Your powers? You don't receive those until you've played the game for a long while. The voice acting? HORRENDOUS! WHAT IS THE MAIN CHARACTER'S ACCENT?! I DON'T KNOW!!! This is a game that just defines bad. It's biggest selling point was the water physics and... they're awful. The water behaves SORT of like it should, but it feels more goopy than anything else, almost like you're swimming through some kind of gel.The plot is so corny and overdone, it's incredible. Some Russian chick made a terrorist extremist group and they don't like you. That's it.Spare yourself, for the love of god.			",80,8,2,7,10,1,12

												I have mixed feelings about this game. It doesnt have very interestet plot, no characters which u will remember. It is not long and boring sometimes. It is shooter, but i used cover system only once in game. On the other side we have well-made water physics, really cool using water as weapon ( sadly in last missions) and the most important - shooting. There is no place for cowards here. You are going straight forward, shooting to enemies with bullets, explosives and sometimes other upgreads for our gun. Ii took me 3 hours to finish this game. I dont regret money or time spent on this game. If u will see it on sale, dont think, just buy it. It is worth its pirce.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game by far is pretty fun, if you know the story to it. to be honest, theirs almost nothing wrong with this game, other than the fact that the Voice acting isn't sub par, but it's ok. it could've been better but it's ok. the story to this game is alright. it could've been a bit more exciting but it's ok. this game kinda reminds me of Tomb Raider, except the main character doesn't show much clevage, unlike Laru Croft :P. good game and nice controlls :D			",93,7,9,3,7,1,0

												This game is 4 years old, but I have yet to see water simulated this realistically in any AAA title to date. The game has some issues. Controls don't work very well, and the writing of the characters kills the immersion. I don't know if the dev was trying to recreate the mixture of realism and humor that Valve is known for, but it just doesn't work. Would love to see this physics engine employed in a better game. Voice acting is for the most part quite good. All that said, I'm recommending this game only if it's on sale. It's not worth $4.99, even as pretty as it is.			",136,63,7,16,17,0,22

												I chose to ""recommend"" this game, but I'm actually quite on the fence. It's definitely worth playing when it's on sale for a dollar or so, but I think it's more of a cool experience than an enjoyable game.Positives:The game looks very good, even if you can tell it's a few years old now. The water system is definitely unique, and it looks the best when you're running through a wet hallway and a wave of water comes sloshing at you. The game basically feels like an interactive movie. You control the action but your objectives are quite linear, so it feels like you're trying to play along as smoothly and effectively as possible. Although the combat is clunky, I enjoy the cover system and sometimes you can look kind of badass. I definitely think of the game as a sort of interactive movie. On the ""game"" side of things, I think the type of gamers who enjoy ""perfecting"" their abilities might enjoy playing through this game a few times so that they get to the point where the can complete it flawlessly. I think it would be really satisfying if you could beat the whole thing without dying and with maximum badassery.Negatives:Okay, so I tried to put a positive spin on the game by calling it an ""experience"", an ""interactive movie"", and highlighting the potential to have a really satisfying perfect playthrough once you've gotten used to the game. But the fact is that it's a bit short, and not exactly a lot of fun. There are a lot of really cool environmental elements (shooting objects, using cover, fighting against and eventually controlling water, shooting electrical cords to remove hazards, etc.), but because these elements are all novel, you have your hand held the whole time. Ideally a game like this would be longer so that you could learn everything and then be left to your own devices, or maybe learn one element at a time and have a few chambers to solve on your own. Movement and combat are quite cumbersome, so it always feels like you're supposed to be accomplishing things faster and more elegantly than you do. And although the water is really cool when you're running through it, don't the developers know that underwater levels are the absolute worst part of platform games? It would be qutie an amazing feat to make those fun, and Hydrophobia sadly didn't. Eventually you get the power to control water, but honestly I used it as little as possible because it just wasn't enjoyable. The main ""replay"" value of the game, aside from the intrinsic value of having cooler run-throughs, is to get a higher score on each of the three acts and the challenge room. But having completed them all, I'm still not really sure how to significantly improve my score.In sum...I do recommend trying this game out. It only takes about 4 hours to finish, so you may as well see it for yourself. But its definitely in a weird place... It sort of feels like a demo for a larger game, except it's way too intricate and polished to be just a demo. Maybe if it were longer and a bit more polished, then it would feel like a GOOD game. I can't put my finger on why it's not, but it isn't..			",112,26,19,11,12,1,18

												This is a tech demo showing of water physics, and that's about it. The models are pretty, the water physics look nice, but it's terrible beyond that. I can imagine the situation, ""Good work, fellow 3d artists, we've made a nice looking game, and the water physics have raised the industry bar! Wait, where's the guy with the game mechanics? We don't have game mechanics! Ah well, slap on some third-person cover shooting, some shoddy climbing mechanics, and a hacked together story led by a whiney protagonist.""Combat is a bit of a mess. You get a sonic gun that non-lethally takes down enemies, but they immediately drown in water, so there's no point in a no-kill run. But if you can get past that, the thing can push explosive barrels in enemy faces that are hopelessly floating in water, that's fun.  Climbing is boring and irritating. One moment I'm a one woman army fighting against misguided terrorists, the next I'm suffering with a terrible camera slowly jumping up some pipes and trying to judge where I'll land from jumping to the next wall. To be honest, the climbing killed the game for me. The campaign is short enough for you to complete in a couple of hours, but I doubt you'll complete it due to a jump at the end in which if you mess up, you have to start about 5 minutes back to where you started, and you'll be messing that jump up a lot. I don't even know what's past that jump, I raged and left after about seven attempts.Though I'll give the game credit where it's due, but it's not enough to redeem it. The combat is a mess, but playing with the physics to kill your enemies is fun, a la Half Life environment kills. Story wise, it started off alight by having memorabilia explain the protagonist's background, but then collapsed when she started talking. Jesus, can that woman whine. Then you got the ""We're killing everyone and everything, including us,"" terrorists. My eyes rolled out of my head when I saw the doomsday machine. Recommendation: Buy it to play with the physics and look at the pretty water, that's it. ",114,29,2,25,32,2,34

												Ok, first off this game is not based on water manipulation till way late in the game. So, if youre looking for that go somewhere else. This game however had a nice feel to it got a good backstory and characters. But, on the other hand it being so short makes it kinda of a downer. So, the gameplay is like most third person shooter nothing special there. It has a cool concept on different ammo types. The game reminded me in some ways of Dues Ex in the way you do the detective work which isnt all that mindpressing. If you ask me nothing in this game was extremely hard to find. All in all I give it 3 out 5 it being an indie game it did impress me, plus I bought for next to nothing so if you see it on sale grab it worth the play through I think.			",93,6,0,18,2,0,4

												I enjoyed this game.  The controls feel funny and the setting inverted Y axis doesn't work when under water.  The usage of water feels really natural by flooding corridors to put out fires and shuting doors to stop flooding.  Your character spends alot of time in the water.  There are bad guys so you do have combat, but you have alternatives to fighting; such as using computers to open doors to wash away the badies.  I enjoyed the sonic pistol, its extremly usefull for more than just shooting the bad guys.  There is a sence of solving puzles, but not too indept that one easyly gets stuck, its more of a learning your options.  After discovering what your capable of you can solve other problems rather quickly.  The story is simple, its clear the badies are just the crazy terrorist type.  Your stuck in the middle of a giant futuristic damaged ship and alot of the time your just trying to save yourself and yet through this you turn into a hero type character making a big difference becuase your in the right place at the right time.

												Quite a few people seem to be giving this game bad reviews, and honestly i can't see why. Personally I had a great time playing this game and it was alot more than I had expected for the price. The game mechanics and controls are great, in fact they're alot better than most games i've played. Shooting while hiding behind cover was well done, and I enjoyed the underwater gunfights. Another thing i liked about this game was the hacking system which is simple but effective. Needless to say, the water looked awesome and the physics to go along with it worked well. The game looked and played amazingly, and the voice acting was passable. The only issue I had was a bit of frame rate drop near the end of the game, which is understandable considering all the water physics. Overall I throughly enjoyed this title, and consider it one of the better game purchases i've made. I find myself wishing there were a sequel, as not many affordable games turn out as great as this one. Would definately recommend!			",191,16,4,23,6,0,9

												Nice game but not too brillian.The physics are very good and the fluid dynamics are very awesome.But it really gives you the impretion it was a game that once the development was paused and then they refound it to be released a few years later.The reason i'm saying this is because some characteristics of the game really look like they were very carefully designed (story, graphics engine, enviroment) but many other features are very badly done as if they did it the last minute (too low texture quality, some bugs every now and then, human body physics too simplified, the main character looks like a whinny sporty version of Helena Bonham Carter).It really is a very good game, but could be better.Looks like it had potential to become something too great but for some reason it staied as it isIif this was a 2008 or 2009 game then i would a top rated one.But for a 2010 game i expected more.Good thing it is on good price since it was released.Recommended if u got free time.

Camera is the worst camera I've ever seen.You'll spend the first 2 hours of the game killing everyone without a problem by jamming the button. Then you'll hit the boss fight and ragequit because it breaks. Repeatedly.

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy is an odd mixture of a third person shooter and a platform game about Kate, an engineer working on the greatest ship of the ocean, the Queen of the World, in a futuristic setting. The game takes place during an unexpected terrorists attack on the ship, with Kate trying to survive the whole ordeal as the ship is filled with water and other environmental hazards. Notice that Hydrophobia was originally released as an Xbox arcade game and was tweaked/remade two times before being reborn as the version you can buy here on Steam, Prophecy.The main objective of the game is to navigate the Queen of the World while trying to survive the rampant hazards within (water floods, fires and electrical sparks): Kate is able to jump, swim and move on ledges, as well as to carry around items to clear her path. An important tool for the exploration is your hacking tool, which can be used to unlock doors and see through the eyes of the security cameras. Truth be told, the whole level advancement does feel repetitive and, beside the varied platforming sessions, you are mainly tasked to find the next code you can use to open the door blocking your way.Hydrophobia also features firefights against the invading terrorist forces. In this regard the games plays out as a typical third person shooter, with your only available gun being a LP 4 sonic pistol, which can be equipped with several kinds of ammos. Truth be told, however, the stock sonic bullets will be the only things you'll ever need to clear Hydrophobia and, unlike the others, are infinite. Something I'd like to point out though: it's really hard to actually get where your enemies are coming from, which can quickly lead to frustration as you die for the third time because you couldn't get to your attackers in time.The title has also some collectables in the form of documents or logs scattered around the levels (with some being less obvious than others to find) and medals, which pretty much counts as in-game achievements. There is also a challenge mode, which isn't very notable.The main problem I have with Hydrophobia: Prophecy is that, despite the great presentation and the well crafted environments, they hardly make up for a very short game (I clocked it around two or three hours) which doesn't make good use of the many interesting elements it puts on the table. I'd advise to try it out only if you get a really good feeling from it			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												First impression review:They are not kidding when saying this game have too much cutscene.The game is good, the water physics is great even for 6 years old game, the combat style is interesting.#################Updated review:Okay, review updated after finishing main game. So my updated impression is:✔ The concept is great, and interesting,❌ but the story is not, I think they made it carelessly, look like this is a demo game for their engine.❌ It's short, but not too short, just 3 hours of gameplay. Again, think it's just their demo,✔ The water physics is so great, I am impressed.❌ Cutscene: I think they can't mix main key element stories in your gameplay, so they decide to just make a lot of it.✔ It has puzzles❌ Too much gunfight, at first it look like an adventure & puzzle game, then it change to ""just like another FPS game"", a single heroine shoot as many bad guy as she can, and then✔ in last minute (maybe 30 mins) of gameplay she got a super power that I think it is not so magic-ish, but a sci-fi-ish (a plus for me)❌ but I can't play with her super power for a long time, again it's short. And too bad the developers/studio is closed, so the sequel is unlikely.How much I like this game score: 6/10 - I like it, but the series is dead, and I hate it. But still like it.How much I want to recommend this game score: 5.5/10 - If you are into fps with beautiful water physics, give it a try. If story matters to you, skip this.			",73,19,2,4,4,0,3

												Seeing this game on sale often at $1.24, I decided to take a chance, thinking how bad can it really be? So, going in with my expectations low I was surprised to find an OK game here. While HP has several flaws, none of them are game braking or frustrating, other than the occasional micro stutter which can be distracting. Being a huge Tomb Raider fan I see it's influence here and can only guess that the dev team wanted to make a TR game in water. While the TR-ish foundation is there, the puzzle solving, jumping and climbing, and combat, all of these are under utilized and so sporadic that most of the time you're just left to play in the water, which is the main focus of the game anyway. Although I have to admit, the effect is kind of cool...YAY!! *splash splash*Overall, the lite game play elements/mechanics are done just well enough without feeling like a chore and I did find the game enjoyable enough even with the barely there story and the meh voice acting. Surprisingly, it actually kept me entertained enough to finish the game in one sitting. If you're a TR fan or enjoy that type of gameplay, I would say give it a try at $1.24, you could do worse with your money.			",515,223,24,56,23,4,33

												Fun use of water physics, hilariously bad voice acting by the protagonist, tissue-thin plot (though the Malthus quotes you find are interesting).  Entertaining to see how many different ways you can shove, fry, burn, drown, and overall abuse your enemies.  Buy it on sale (if not on sale for $5 or below, consider this game not recommended).  If you have Nvidia 3d Vision, get the Helix Mod fix for this, since much of the game's appeal is based on physics and eye candy it really enhances the experience.  Works perfectly aside from some occasional pink textures popping up in rooms with water on the floor.			",345,102,3,51,35,2,84

												My friend bought me this title for 49 cents. I did not expect much, but at least the game met those expectations.It is the start of a new century. The story follows a young women named Jane Wilson, a surprisingly fit lady who works for a nano-robotics company. It is revealed at the start of the game that she is hydrophobic, which is ironic, since this game involves lots and lots of swimming (more on that later). She needs to stop a terrorist organisation focused on destroying her workplace and everything it stands for. The gameplay brings nothing new to the table. It is a third-person shooter, with a single weapon but with multiple types ammunition. The most useful ammotype in the game (and arguebly the most powerful) is the sonic blasts. Unfortunatly this renders the other ammotypes nigh useless, creating a great imbalance in the gameplay. As I said previously, the game involves alot of swimming. While underwater, I often found myself fighting the unintuitive controls. There is a mechanic which restricts the amount of time the player can spend underwater, before returning to the surface for air. One can also get involved in bouts of underwater combat, which is less exciting than it sounds.Speaking of combat, overall, it is definitely on the feeble side. The best way to clear out enemies, that I have found, (keeping in mind that I played it on hard) is to headshot them with sonic blasts from behind cover. This is not really a game where run and gun tactics are that effective. Taking cover is always your safest bet. In general the combat is not that difficult   and can be quite repetitive. The game uses an interesting way of pointing you towards objectives. The player uses a transparent tablet-like device and holds it infront of the screen. This presents a sort of augmented reality that indicates the location of objectives. This device is also used for hacking. Hacking is more rudimentary than it sounds and is just used to open doors and hack security camaras. Sometime the player needs to hack control panels. This involves a minigame, where the mouse is used to control the amplitude and the wavelength of a wave. The player needs to match these variables to those of a another wave. This is also very easy, but surprisingly fun (I am a bit of a geek :-) ).And then there are the powers. The pictures of this game leads one to believe that they are an integral part of gameplay. Unfortunately they are not. The powers are only introduced near the end of the game. Making the players experience with them far to short to justify their existence. Speaking of too-short, this game can be completed in six hours if you are playing on hard difficulty. And much quicker on the easier ones. This is much too short for my taste and makes me feel that the developers shouldn't have released this game in its current state.Now for the million dollar question (or whatever you pay for the game) Is it worth it?For 5$, no.For 1$, yes.I give it 5\10			",50,12,1,8,2,0,2

 By the gods, those water effects!I see alot of people complaining about this game, its bugs and/or lag, but so far i found none, maybe they have crappy computers and don`t know.The game is actually quite good, and the storyline is pretty great too, although it needs work.I also like the weapons and their ideas, but by the gods those water effects though, figures that a game with the name hydrophobia would contain water, but didn`t expect THAT much, but those effects though, hmm hmm.You can also shoot certain windows/glass and/or open doors to let water in or out of a room, which its a pretty great mechanic i must say.I also like the leading lady role(female protagonist), and although some may disagree, i think if it was a guy the game wouldn`t be as good, but hey, its just me.In my opinion, there should more games like this, but with less water......and with more bang bang, and a guy named Bustin Jieberes so i can shoot him hehehe.All and all, a great game where water is the main subject, and for you to start facing your fear of water, or just if you have nothing else to play, or if you like female protagonists, girl power!

												Hydrophobia is an extremely interesting game. It has excellent water physics but requires some bug fixes IMO. At current I'm stuck trying to find my way out of a level and nothing tried works - I believe this to be a glitch in the game though. Overall I give it a 8/10 - very good graphics, good story, good physics and extremely pretty water.			",140,12,6,10,1,0,5

												Not bad for 39p!It's short, lacks gameplay and has a fair few bugs, but for the price you can't really complain.The water effects looks quite nice (especially considering the game is 4 years old) and it's something to pass the time.As others have said, it's more like a tech demo than a game as the gameplay mechanics are so basic and the combat very simplistic.Has the potential to be something nice if they can make a proper full game out of it and polish it up a bit.I'm ticking 'Yes' to recommend simply because it is what it is, and if that is all you're expecting then you won't be disappointed.

												1. Awesome water effects 2. Graphics looks pretty good3. Story is a bit weak/confusing4. Enemies are a bit stupid...most times the enemy just stares at me in the middle of a hall instead of taking cover or you know shooting back. 5. Was expecting a more open world or more of the story to build up before all hell breaks lose. 6. Controls seem a bit ""glitchy"" (used controller and keyboard and found sometimes the character didn't response)7. Glitches (found a few areas in the game that just killed me or got me stuck forcing a restart) Overall it's a decent game to play and burn through. I would suggest picking up during a sale.

												It's an indie game and you can see it was created on a tight budget as the ending feels a bit rushed for my taste. Nevertheless is it a surprisingly good game with some interesting approaches to gameplay mechanics e.g. hacking terminals and of course the phantastic water. As you'll do a lot of platforming it is worth mentioning that the movement controls are solid. As Hydrophobia was first released on XBLA it supports Xbox controller although playing with keyboard and mouse is no problem at all. What you get on steam is a reworked version of the game with better graphics and one different character model with new voice acting - I like the original scottish accent better. Please compare Xbox vs Pc version on youtube. The game code feels not very optimized for Pc . I play titles like Metro Last Light or Crysis 3 with ease in max settings in 1920x1200 while my HD 7950 doesn't get noisy whereas Hydrophobia seems quite taxing in max settings. So if you own an older pc or a low spec laptop you may be forced to turn down the graphics settings.Checkpoints are well placed and fair meaning you don't have to replay lengthy sequences if you're dying. The only bug I noticed was a clipping error in chapter 2. You will get  as average gamer 6 hours of gameplay out of it.If you're asking yourself if it is worth buying - definitely. If it's on sale you can get it for a few cents so why would you miss out on it? There are  choices far worse you could make. My conservative rating is a solid 7 out of 10.

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy  --- AN PASSIBLE DIVERSION (BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S SHORT)Third-person (mostly) platformer/adventure with some shooting. I was well aware of this games reputation for not being all that great. Most of the conversation revolved around ""pretty water"", ""short"", and ""boring gameplay"". While I mostly agree, I have played worse (and uglier) games and for $ 0.49, it was an adequate game experience. LOOKS: The game is fairly pretty graphically but the main character and most character models are trite and boring.Overall, I was surprised how nice the graphics were despite my (purposely) lowered expectations. Of course, the games claim to fame, the water, is fantastic. It rolls, splashes, pours through doors, and ripples quite realistically. It even reacts to explosions and your sonic gun. SOUND:I don't have too much for sound. It mostly adequate. Rushing water sounds nice, explosions are...explody, etc. However, the voice acting is awkward and annoying. This mainly applies to the protagonist and ""Scooter"" as the others were at least passible. The problem is compounded by the unnatural dialogue that just didn't flow naturally. GAMEPLAY:It's an OK game. Not really much  of a shooter as it's very light on enemies. It too linear to be a real adventure puzzle game. You never really have to think too much. The computer screen tools used in game is a nice addition to spice up the game some. I just wished they did more with it. The weapons are adequate but the intial weapon is all I ever needed. CONTROLS:Solid. Aside from occasionally missing my backward jumps, I never really had any control issues. I tried out both the gamepad and keyboard controls, and they each worked well as a control scheme. LENGTH:Really short. Felt more like 1/3 a full game. However considering the less-than-riveting gameplay, the length is just about right. STORY:Besides the water physics, the backstory was the most interesting part of the game. I felt that it was a good backdrop that was unfortunately underutilized. Furthermore, several story elements were hinted but not actually exploited fully. Pacing was awkward and there was no real character development to make you care about anyone dying (including your own character). All of that, along with the weird almost drowning as a child thing that never was explained, really amplify the ""we intended to do so much more"" vibe of the game. BUGS:I did notice a few odd graphical glitches. After dying once, the level seamed confused as to what state it should be in (i.e. pre- or post- explosion) so it compromised and gave me the pre-explosion level with the post-explosion decorations. Also, I think I failed to quit properly once and it erased my whole game. However, it was merely took 10-20 mins to get it back as I already knew the way and you can (blessedly) skip cutscenes.SUMMARY:Not great by any means. Play if you want a diversion. It'll keep you interest long enough to get you to almost the end, then you have to just muscle through the last 15-30 mins.			",296,87,4,54,19,0,46

												This game is a mess. Sure enough the water physics are great, but that isn't enough to carry it all. The controls are horrific, something I oddly enough only noticed during the final act of the game. For a game with a lot of water-based gameplay, the swimming controls are really cluncky: only willing to resurface when you hit the space key, only willing to dive when you hit shift. The camera is completely paranoid in these situations. The AI is hands down the worst I've ever seen. One enemy simply walked right by me after I literally bumped into it. Shooting mechanics are equally bad. Managed to deliver quite a few headshots with the bullet impact not even remotely near the guy's head. Not even remotely near the guy even. I only spent about 50 cents for this and for that money it wasn't really a bad purchase. It did manage to entertain me for about an hour and a half. But I cannot recommend this to anyone, it is simply too bad a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not that bad at all. So, I wouldn't say this good, but this definitely is not bad. First, the story and setting is nice. The overall shooting gameplay as well. I just wanted to play with water more in story.Second, games should not be judged by their length. This one is just ~3-4 hours long, but if it would be 8 hours long, we all could see that developers just wanted to put stuff in it, so their game is longer. I respect them for not doing it and revealing all their ideas without putting silly stuff in as well.So buy while it's on 90% discount. You won't want to pay full price for such a short game.

												Its not really worth 5$... a short mini series that was actually quite good, a mix of shooter puzzle and RPG mixed in, was good fun while it lasted, 3.75/5 stars for the good effort put in the game...To be honest i bought it while it was like 1$ or 50 cents, totally worth the time :)			",19,0,1,2,1,0,0

												So! It may say I have 11 minutes played, but I actually beat the game using offline mode and we all know how amazing steam's offline mode is. At any rate! Review is for the game and not this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM the entirety of gaming is bound to now which is killing off a lot of what made gaming good.Hydrophobia! It is an awful game... Just, its so bad. I might actually make a video review. The story is pedantric and juvenile, the mechanics are flimsy, swimming is terrible... Shooting is the worst part and it is virtually all you do, the climbing is so linear its not freeing at all and feels more bound than games without it. This is just the worst game I've played all year.PRO's:Neat water!CON's:Graphics: - Repeat assets looped over and over.                 - Saturated motion blurr nightmare on max. It... Actually is worse when you turn it off even.                 - Effects look like they came from the 2000's... Not in the good way either.Audio:      - Random cranekd the FRICK up noises blended with quiet inaudible sound ques you need to turn it up for                  leading to what I like to call bleeding ear syndrome.                 - The voice acting is just, the worst. The security friend guiding you sounds like he's from some 90's narrated arcade game, the woman they hired to voice act actually managed to portray the quality of cardboard in her voice acting... She literally sounds like a cardboard being, not a human being just... Cardboard. Awful this woman should never work in voice acting again, it was just horrific.Gameplay:- Ho boy! Swimming screws up, jumping mechanics tell you to jump straight back when you get barely enough distance to make it a foot while doing this. Shooting is just... You get this one pistol where one mode is good, sonic, the first one which is a charge up mechanic. You get semi-automatic rounds which do less damage than mildly charged sonic rounds... Then you get these ""silent kill remote explosive gel rounds"" I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not they are how you stealth kill, with explosions, which have a drop off effect where instead of lobbing just fire STRAIGHT to the grounda t the end of their range.                  - Moving is like pulling fricken teeth in multiple instances. I mean gosh damn, climbing is so straight and singular it's like a GOP meeting up in here. You can barely deviate at all and are locked into one certain path. Often youa re asked to ""Hold S and jump backwards!"" Which is inadequate for ANY of the jumps it tells you to do on PC at least. Literally, it does not close the gap. I had to fight around the system and jump in different ways each time... If you picked up this crap, simply stand up on the beams and jump straight. There's a point near the end of the game where youa re forced into a long climb sequence in this plaza place where its not so simple... You have to actually come at it angularly as it will not allow you to directly jump and it INSISTS you get back down on the beam then jump backwards which fails each time. I dunno if this is a PC thing only but yeah. It happens.Story:          - The game doesn't end. It literally resolves nothing, you beat the last boss and... No explanation.                    - The only thing worse than the voice acting is the character's depth                    - The game LITERALLY does not end. You don't know what happens to anyone other than the last boss... Conclusion:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME NO MATTER HOW CHEAP ",81,8,0,10,10,1,18

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy is a typical adventure game, with lots of innovative uses of water. At its core, the gameplay is similar to other games in the genre, but the game uses its setting and environment to its advantage. The result is an interesting game and experience as players navigate through water filled environments.The game is set on a floating city, which is attacked by terrorists who take control of the entire place. Kate, a systems engineer, gets involved in the mess and has to escape to safety, fighting the terrorists along the way. The story for this game is quite linear and not exactly an amazing story. There are a few good lines by the characters though to break up the flow of the story a bit. In addition to the linear story are optional objects and documents in the world, which provide additional backstory and perspectives on the characters and events. With a decent story to keep players interested in the game, it functions well enough to fit the main gameplay attractions in and provide a bit of depth to those interested in reading up about the world.For the most part, gameplay consists of getting to certain objectives on the map using a single route. Getting to these places is done by some platforming, climbing, or swimming. There are tools that are unlocked later on, which are a scanner and a firearm. In addition to getting to places on the map, there are also some puzzles that need to be completed to go on to the next area. The gameplay is honestly a bit on the simple side with these mechanics being pretty basic, but it’s serviceable to play through. The biggest part of the game is the water as the title suggests. Due to the water’s realistic nature in this game, it has a major impact in how players have to work with and use water to their advantage. Opening a flooded door sends water rushing in, which fills up the room with water to swim in. This water feature can play a huge role in firefights, as the battles shift to fighting underwater in flooded rooms. Littered around the map are various objects to collect, which can be collected for achievements. These objects make the game focused more on exploration for players that try to soak up their surroundings and find things around the world. It makes for a nicer experience to step back and see what hidden things were placed around and to try and find them. The simple adventure gameplay might be off-putting for those wanting something more complex, but the usage of water is done in a great way that makes the game play and feel unique.The setting is a floating city in the near future. On the whole, the game uses a realistic style, though at times the graphics do look a bit dated. The water looks amazing though, with some of the best water visuals around. The developers really nailed getting the water to both look and flow in a realistic manner. Since the water is such a major component of the game, it’s good that the water effects are very appealing when playing and interacting with it.Alongside the realism focused graphics is the soundtrack. The music for this game is comprised of both traditional and electronic instruments. It’s nothing particularly distinct, though it does help that the music is dynamic based on ingame events and helps to give cues on what’s going on. Overall it’s the water graphics that shine the most, with the other content looking good enough to make a fine game.Hydrophobia has some standard adventure gameplay and a straightforward plot, but the usage of water does make things interesting. The short length and typical story and gameplay might not be wanted by some. For those wanting a short game that is simple to pick up and play and has some awesome use of water, Hydrophobia is a good game in that regard.			",106,20,5,4,5,2,24

												This game is a must buy if you enjoy all aspects of water!I did hit a few game breaking bugs near the middle (which is to be expected of any well made game), but when I quit and came back to the game later on, and my saves had been deleted forcing me to start again, I was like yeeeeaaahh!! that solves that issue! I also heard talk of there being a few problems with the elemental physics, like the random placement of electricity or the amount of fire in the water, but you have to ask yourself, why wouldn't a big ship-city be filled full of oil and napalm, and have exploding barrels in every room?I'd also like to thank the makers for giving me the opportunity to hate the characters of this game with such passion! from their horrible grinding voices and the way they move, right through to their terrible (or just never mentioned) back stories. The people who made this game must have worked so hard! I read a few bad reviews, but come on guys, I know there's been a lot of complaints about the special powers that you only get to fight the last boss with, which I know is one of the reasons you bought this game, but you did get 5 minutes to play with the powers in that moving blocks to make a bridge room on the way there, so don't be greedy!  and while we are talking about it, I thought the pushing 4 buttons at once system (using the controller), to use your water magic gave us excellent control, and the lack of a tutorial for how you use them just made the game delightfully challenging, like when I fell down that elevator shaft to my death 20 times in a row.When I first started playing and found that it was just another game based around a silly gimmick with boring linear fps and cliche wall climbing gameplay and rubbish graphics that was made to demonstrate their water physics engine to prospective buyers, I was disappointed, but by the end when I'd pulled out all my hair and was crying into my hands, I really began to appreciate this game.

												If you play Hydrophobia expecting a full game, you'll likely be disappointed.  It's not very long, and it doesn't have a proper ending or wonderful plot, and it does have some fiddly bits.However, if you go into it expecting a tech demo, I think you'll be much more impressed.  The water effects are great and create a great atmosphere.  You also have an augmented reality tablet which allows some interesting mechanics.  Overall it's a fun world to dip into for a bit.  I wish the developers had had the opportunity to continue the story and polish out the rough spots.Even at full price I think Hydrophobia Prophecy is worth purchasing, though not by a wide margin.  However, it's frequently on sale very cheap ($0.49 at time of writing), which makes it easy to recommend if the water effects catch your eye.			",758,298,12,108,82,6,145

												I had low expectations for this one based on the MetaCritic score, but this ain't a bad game.  The water physics and effects are impressive, the graphics are pretty good, and the voice acting is decent.  I would stop short of calling it ""Great"".  Your inside a ship and environments all look the same for the most of the game.  The controls could be better.  Gunplay can be fun, but I wish they emphasized stealth aspects more than straight up battles.  The story is passable, but the ending leaves a lot to be desired.  You can play the whole thing in 3-4 hours, but this was designed as a downloadable game for consoles too, so there was no expectation this would be a full fledged AAA.  Besides, you can pick it up for only a few bucks.  All in all, not a bad deal and a decent way to spend a few hours.			",152,42,3,18,4,3,31

Hydrophobia Prophecy is in fact a great game that deserves attention from both newcomers to the brand and gamers that might have already played the older versions of the game.

												A novel fps game with a cool water and physics system. There are only around 3 hours of play in the main campaign but it is enjoyable and intriguing. The control system can be quite clunky at times, especially when in deep water, but the shooting and cover systems work well. It's a 7.5 out of 10. Not totally amazing brilliant, but if you are looking for something a little quirky from your action fps, give it a shot.			",331,73,14,30,15,4,42

												Honestly, this game is pretty weak. The water effects look super bizarre, and are only around for part of the game. The rest is a semi-tedious trek through generic shootersville #28. Some of the writing is whitty and good, while the rest is very forgettable. The protagonist is pushed as a really interesting character, when in reality, she isn't. Now, I'm all for female leads in games, but the lead in Hydrophobia isn't interesting. She's a wet dish rag who gets water powers for like 15 minutes. Wet, get it? Because I called her a dish rag. Really though, this game is forgettable.Forgettable/10.			",85,5,2,6,4,0,13

												I spent $5 on this game. And I thought it'd be fun.I could not have been more wrong. The climbing mechanic in this game is an insufferable, hellish experience. The portions of the game where it asks you to jump back from one ledge onto another appear to be based completely on luck. If you do it the exact same way 15 times, you will die 14/15 times, and on the last try, despite doing nothing differently, it will magically work. I could have spent $5 on a hooker with AIDS and had a better time than this game.			",96,0,0,8,1,0,7

												This Game isn't at bad as lots of people say.first of all, the graphics are pretty good for an indie game, and they run nicely on decent gaming hardware due the the Havok/source engine. the Proprieatary water ingine is really amazing. Caution, its not the best water i've seen in video games, but, it does have a really good physics that make it fun to play around with it while going around in the game.it's pretty fun to see the room flooding because you open doors and the water level is different from other rooms, and it's nice to unleach a huge wave of water onto the enemies . . . what bring you to the problem of this game.appart from the naration and the story who is really not that entertaining, the IA has a big tendency to do whatever they want.you cannot sneak on them because they'll see you miles away and they just uses a basic system of cover&shoot gameplay.really bassic . . .but in overall the game is pretty fun to play. it may look to some as a mix in between Tomb Raider action and Remember me Parkour, game who by the way came out way before both of those game. so for a 3 years old game, its really decent and you'll have a nice time to pass on it, and for this price (0,49USD$ at the moment) it's a must have in your library ! you've bought cards that were more expensive than that game !

												I was actually really liking this game, and ready to give it a rather positive review, until I encountered by far one of the♥♥♥♥♥♥poorest final boss battles in GAMING HISTORY.  First of all, it's the ONLY boss battle in the entire game.  Secondly, it's at least two to three times harder than any other part OF the game, and requires the mastery of a completely new skill you only gain ten minutes beforehand.  Thirdly, it appears to have no checkpoints throughout its excruciating length.  Fourthly, it's inconsistent as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and what worked the last time won't necessarily work the next (half the time I successfully threw explosives at the boss robot, the other half I merely succeeded in blowing MYSELF up).  All I can say is: THANK GOD FOR YOUTUBE.  Oh, and your reward for beating the boss?  One of the briefest and most abrupt (and I don't mean ""John Carpenter's The Thing"" kinda enigmatic; I really do just mean ABRUPT) end cut scenes ever.  Rarely before have I witnessed a final fifteen minutes of a game which seemed so...tacked on, and thoroughly unsatisfying.     And maaaaan...I was really looking forward to defending this game against all the naysayers.  I'm still gonna thumb it up and give it a reasonable score, but ONLY because it was so enjoyable (borderline ENTHRALLING, even!) earlier on.  If you don't mind a 4 to 6 hour game with an ending you probably couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed completing, feel free to pick it up on sale (i.e. for LESS than five dollars).  For those who require a bit more narrative closure, you may want to give this wishy-washy mess a bit of a miss.Verdict: 7/10.     ",745,418,6,57,40,5,78

												""The ultimate edition of the jaw-dropping action-adventure game set onboard a floating city.""That's the description for this game given on the Steam store page. I dunno about any of that. ""Jaw-dropping""? This game wasn't even *bad* enough to make my jaw drop, let alone be amazing enough to induce jaw dropping as they imply. ""Floating city""? This game could have been set inside an underwater facility for all that it matters that it's a floating city. In fact, I'm incensed that it isn't because 'floating city' implies a more interesting setting than a simple underwater facility and this game is NOT INTERESTING in any aspect.The story is insipid, worse, there's no conclusion whatsoever. The final boss battle ends and the game does so as well, abruptly and without denouement of any kind.You see the little splash image of the protagonist using some kind of water powers? That's almost a lie. You don't get those abilities until the last 10% of this game, and you only really get to use it for one move in the final boss battle.The crappiness of this game really comes out when you are trying to do anything more complicated than standing still and shooting. When the action gets hectic and I need to dodge, aim, shoot, and use the water powers in rapid succession, it's like the game gets confused and faints. Inexplicably, she'll get stuck pointing her gun in one direction and not only am I unable to shoot but I can't change direction anymore either. Moving the mouse moves the camera freely around her but does not change where she is actually facing or aiming (not that it matters, since I can't shoot). This game has absolutely nothing of substance to offer as an experience. The only interesting thing about it is technical: the water uses realistic fluid dynamics. The best I can say about it is that it is not ""offensively bad"" like, say, Surgeon Simulator. Unfortunately, unlike Surgeon Simulator, this game is simply not fun.Incidentally, this will be the very first game I've ever given a Not Recommended rating. Make of that what you will.

												This game was not fun to start out. It thrusts you into the world with a lot of loud noises and commotion. After that, it simmers, even though it sounds crazy.All the back story is done through documents you find throughtout the game, which is not how you tell a story.The story is pretty lackluster... Until the last act when you get the weird blue thing. Then things kinda get interesting! They start teasing this thing caled S.A.R.A., you hear weird things in the water, and it feels funner, more challenging. You get powers and then its really interesting! You fight the final boss, you kill the big bad?, and then you are cured. Smash cut to the points screen. Nothing is resolved. You know nothing. Nothing was gained. You didn't change.I feel like this game had 6 hours cut from it, for some odd reason.But I guess the water is cool? When it's not glitching. Like everything else.			",166,45,0,38,8,0,12

												Despite it's annoyances, I thought it was a decent game.  Then it was unable to access my saves.  Edit: Having gone back and played through the rest, here's the negative.Unbalanced combat, I never used any type of ammo beyond the starting one.  Which never runs out, unlike all the ones I never used.The story is either boring, nonsensical, or poorly explained. Voice acting.  Usually manages to be okay, however there were several points where I started laughing at it.The coolest part of the game comes into play about two rooms before the final boss, not enough time to appreciate it.Finally, the final boss was annoying and repetitive all by itself.

												6/10 - Wasted potential. Premise sent to hell after +/- 20 minutes of playing and replaced by underwater shooter against fully-armed terrorists, who cant kill you, but they do many things (like spawning behind you in cleared room full of water, repeatedly) to make your life miserable. Where other games are just getting started, Hydrophobia is repetitive and boring (after 2+ hours). The final boss (famous for being hard to kill) is pretty easy to kill, the game itself just make it stupidly difficult. Go play this, you will not enjoy it much, but I still recommend it.

												I've made bad decisions in my life. Buying this game has to be, atleast on my top 5 worst desicions ever. When I started playing I said to myself ""This ain't so bad"" OH! Was I wrong!I don't think I can say one thing that's good about this game.The voice acting, the levels, the lenght of the game, the story. It's just.... Really bad. I don't have any other way to put it. It's just... bad. This is the worst game I have EVER played.0/10			",234,26,2,11,7,0,12

												This absolutely mediocre shooter is unique for it's laughably silly-looking dynamic water physics. You play as an engineer with no combat experience on a huge future boat attacked by terrorists and you singly-handedly defeat them all. (kind of like a talkative female Gordon Freeman maybe?) Very close to the end of the game, you gain the ability to manipulate water and make it look even sillier, which you barely make any use of before rolling the credits. It's short, so that's nice.[WEAK recommendation]			",313,50,10,31,35,1,55

												This game is known by achievementhunters as before and after ""the patch"". Both some medals and some documents are still glitchy and thus two achievements. If you're really, really careful you might get the achievements in one playthrough (after the patch) but that includes som major thinking ahead of time.It is no Lara Croft game altough the controls are comparable to the first Tomb Raider games ;) The physics and the water is not ""all that""... it is not even cool.I have played it three times now to get all achievements and that was a pain in the butt all but once.This game was overrated and I give it 2/10 sinking collectibles			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not the best game, but for $5 it's worthwhile. Reminiscent of Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, although not quite as refined.  I've already beaten the XBox 360 version and am re-playing on PC because I heard it has some game added on after the 360's ending, which was very abrupt and left a lot unanswered. There's really no higher recommendation I can think of than ""I finished it, and am willing to play through a second time.""Edit: so the additional boss fight that the 360 version didn't have is awful, and may keep me from finishing the game PC. But overall still a quality game, and worth picking up the next time it goes on sale.			",1603,732,61,207,160,18,229

												I was impressed by this game, it definitely has the coolest water/physics I have seen in a game and the story is quite fun with lots of action and exploring the environment and collectables and data to find if you enjoy that as well. The controls are pretty intuitive and it does a good job of easing you in without requiring much of a breach in immersion to explain what you need to do as it has several unique mechanics like hacking by matching wave amplitudes or using sonic bullets to break glass walls. Easily a recommend for fans of third-person action/adventure. It is a short game, split into 3 Acts of about 1 hour each, so be aware of that in your consideration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rewriting this due to my cringey old format of writing one giant paragraph. I'll keep it short and simple. The game controls like♥♥♥♥♥ The graphics look like vaseline is smeared all over your screen and you're playing a game released a good 2/3 years earlier than 2011. The parkour is ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious, linear, poorly animated, and just boring. It also doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work. There are jumps that look like you should be able to make but no, you can't. You'll think you can grab a ledge but you can't. You'll hit a ledge you CAN grab but bounce off to your death.Also the voice acting and script is hilariously bad. Especially with the main character. There's nothing redeeming here, it looks like a decent mid tier budget game but that would be insulting to the entire ps2/xbox 360 generation. Why the ♥♥♥♥ would you design a game focused on platforming/parkour when you can't animate for♥♥♥♥♥♥ The only thing the game has are the gimmicky water physics. I'd rather go play a falling sand game if I'm going to play with water. At least those are free.			",508,104,12,61,23,7,29

												Hydrophobia? More like Hydroforgettable.The game has an interesting concept but it all takes place in a location and a world that has little to no explanation about where you are and what's going on. It's clearly a sci-fi setting but we're not told anything about it. As such it's very hard to feel connected to the characters or plot since the lack of information about the setting leaves us very disconnected from what is happening.It's not a terrible game but I'm definately glad I didn't pay more then 49 cents for it.

												Let me begin by saying: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! FUUUUUUUUCK! GOD BLOODY DAMN! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! That would just about sum up my vocal experience while playing this game. I'm gonna begin by saying the ONLY good thing about this game, IT'S SHORT! I finished the main campaign in 3.2 hours, THANK GOD for that... One more hour and I would've been on the six o'clock news with a KNIFE LODGED INTO MY BRAIN!!!Why? WHY NOT! The first hours of this game are not that bad, it's divided into 3 acts, with the first act being a 15 minute mission, and the other two acts being two 1 hour-long missions... Coupled with a boss fight at the end. I honestly don't even know where to start naming all the problems this game has.. At first it looks like a flawed little budged game, but that's not bad, right? WROOOOOOOOOONG! After the first 30 minutes, the problems start to begin. I think I'm going to count them all, let's see how many we can get.1. CAMERA ISSUES, OF-♥♥♥♥ING-COURSE! Camera is so bad, it's HORRIBLE! Unresponsive, derpy, going all over THE GOD DAMN PLACE! 2. CONTROL ISSUES. Irregular controls. What works NOW won't work 1 minute later. Jumps and ""climbing"" parts are RANDOM AS F*CK. 3. ENEMIES APPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE! I SWEAR TO GOD, I've seen enemies pop up RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, and not teleporting from another location or anything, just SPAWNING RANDOM ENEMIES IN MY FUUUUUUUUCKING FAAAAAACE! 4. Accuracy on your weapons is BLOODY♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!! Most of the times you're gonna fight with a pistol that shoots one bullet per second and you're gonna miss most of the times. But then you're gonna get some auto ammunition for your weapon and miss ALL THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TIME! 5. And what would bad accuracy be without PERFECT ENEMY ACCURACY? Yes, you heard it.. AIMBOTTING ENEMIES! Not only they appear in YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FACE, but they also shoot like 999999 bullets per second in your face with perfect accuracy! 6. And what would perfect accuracy enemies be without also being A GOD ♥♥♥♥ING DAMN BULLET SPONGE!!! SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MANY SHOTS THEY TAKE... FUUUUUUCKING RAMBO OVER HERE, each and every one of them!!! - Take into consideration that all of these flaws are on the EASIEST DIFFICULTY, so don't go around telling me ""lower the difficulty idiot""...7. Like I said many, MANY enemies everywhere appearing out of nowhere but also coupled with the usual enemy ""benefits"". There are quite a few underwater combat situations and guess what, enemies that spawn underwater have FAHKING GILLS! Just sitting there underwater forever, shooting you, without you seeing where they shoot from..8. Incredibly bad final boss fight.. Again you get more of the same infinite enemies spawning besides you while you try to juggle with the 999999999999999999999999999999 simultaneous STEPS that you have to take to just put a TINY DENT in the boss, and you have to do that for like 5-6 times before you defeat him, so.. arm yourself with patience.. and a STRAIT JACKET!Honestly, it's such a bad game, it's not even funny. There are more flaws than this, rest assured, but I just finished the game and I'm still incredibly angry. I honestly am amazed I'm still alive and didn't jump from the roof of my building yet. This game made me RAGE more than ANY OTHER GAME MADE ME RAGE, EVER! And I played a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of games in my 21 years of life...♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls, aimbotting enemies, bad accuracy on weapons, crappy camera, crap-ton of backtracking for objectives... I don't even know why I bother writing reviews for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games, all of them have the same damn issues, I should write a general review and copy-paste it for every crap game I play. Or put it in a text file and just link that text file in every review... The game has a pretty cool concept, and the reallistic water technology is pretty awesome, it had SO much potential to be a cool game with water powers, but no, you only get ONE water power and that's in the LAST 20 MINUTES OF THE GAME, would've been so cooler if you would've got it earlier in the game, but noooooo, we can't do anything to entertain our players, can we? The execution and gameplay of this are HORRIBLE and shallow! I hate my life right now, this game destroyed me, I'm going to cry myself to sleep.			",21,2,0,1,1,0,0

The water physics are pretty fun but it's just there for show until the last 5 minutes of the game and the overall feel is underwhelming and kind of boring. It's also really short, i finished it in under 2 hours more or less and i died/got lost a lot of times. Story background is cool but never really developed, mainly you are a girl trying to escape a giant ship that was bombed by terrorists.Conclusion: Would not recommend to buy. The game is not fun, most of the time it's frustating and boring. The game suffers framerate problems constantly.			",344,84,7,51,21,3,49

												Starts off really promising with an interesting setting, rather intriguing plot and the promise of unique combat.Ends up being a cookie-cutter shooter with little extra mechanics. While the water looks rather well and the utilization is alright (the swimming mechanics I really liked, compared to many other games that make you swim and dive through areas) with the mechanics and the hydrophobia of the protagonist, hence the game's title, being displayed comprehensibly, the advertised water control mechanics only become available shortly before the game ends. Which means there is really little to be had, as the expected unique selling points are implemented poorly or just too late in the game.The developers are bankrupt, apparently, and it seems as if they ran out of money halfway through the game. I really feel like this game was either supposed to be a trilogy or just a lot bigger. But about 2 or 3 hours in the story leaps ahead, you have a huge room where you must fight many baddies and then suddenly a boss fight, a short and unsatisfying cutscene and then ... nothing. That's it. Nothing is really concluded, nothing really happened. It seems like a prelude to the actual game, which will probably never come.Might be worth a bargain price for the water experience, but otherwise expectations will probably fall short, as the game severely lacks substance.

												Ok, there were a lot of fun things about this game. I really enjoyed the first two acts. Especially the climbing bits, and I even got to enjoy the hacking, even though it was timed.Of course, there were quite a few reasons I'd say 'skip this game.' The plot goes from a pace of a car to a rocket jet by the third act. Once Kate gets hydrokenisis (not a spoiler since it's in the screenshots), you barely get any time to really get how it works before you're expected to use it for the boss battle. There are a whole lot of great things about this plot that aren't given a chance to be explained. Malthusians as the terrorists, with calvinist beliefs mixed in there (calling all non-malthusians 'reprobates' meaning doomed to die), an implied overpopulation, the idea Kate is living in a ship due to that... all great ideas, but never really explored to its true potential.I guess I wished for a first level like Half Life's, where the player wanders around Black Mesa and gets an idea of the place before everything gets crazy. The plot summary suggests there will be character arcs, and there aren't. The only thing that changes is that Kate stops yelling whenever she has to go balance on poles. Kate's goal changes inexcplicably part-way through (I suppose her boss being killed might have something to do with it, though he was a jerk to her anyway) from ignoring curing herself and finding her friend to chasing down the bad guy.And it just kinda... ends. This is one of those games where the controls sometimes flat out ignore what you tell it to. Which is especially frustrating considering how unforgiving it is. (There is no saving, just checkpoints.) On that note, this was another game where the hints couldn't be turned off, and they were always brought attention to by an annoying sound. I'm normally not bothered by voice actors, but Kate's voice actor was incredibly distracting. The fact is, this game does a lot of things right, which makes the things it does wrong even more frustrating. What a great world to just ignore.			",141,40,2,16,7,2,18

												I tried to give this another shot. Bad idea. Don't buy it.I once said it was not a bad game. Wrong, it is a bad game. Repetitive gameplay, useless extra powers, terrible checkpoints, terrible camera, and terrible physics. For those who really care, is also has terrible graphics, the only redeaming graphical element is the water, and it otherwise looks unimpressive.Voice acting is also mediocure and does not help the rest of the game. The villan is utterly unimaginative and cartoonish. The collectables are pointless, so they might as well should not even be there.I put it on easy just to get through it, even then the boss battle was brutal. As an example of the terrible checkpoint system, if you fail on this boss, once, they send back to the beginning. Even the fact that they force you to use the terrible extra mechanics in this battle make it all the more frustrating, not challenging. This is where I had to stop, I could not continue.The level design is also really bad, clustered, and full of dead ends. If it was not for the objective markers leading me along the linear path, I would have not known where to go. Linearity is OK, but not with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level design. This game has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level design. That is about all I can say on this game. I don't know the nature and resources of the dev team, but even with minimal resources a great game can be produced. This seems to me to be a project that was too big and too ambitious, and as a result just came out... bad. 10/10 for effort, 3/10 for execution.			",71,5,0,0,2,0,6

Essentially a D-rate Tomb Raider clone, the gimmick here is water and how water influences the game's environments, puzzles, combat, and physics. Unfortunately, the water is overhyped and not enough to make a sub-par gaming experience worthy of your time. While the developers deserve credit for listening to player feedback and releasing two updated versions of the game after launch, the game is currently still plagued with bad design and technical issues like poor collision detection, missing textures, dumb AI, and game-breaking bugs (for some). Gameplay and level design are outright bland. The single enemy type in the game (save for the ""final boss"") can be easily dispatched with by using your default weapon. There are electricity and fire hazards that can be used to inflict environmental damage upon your foes, but the same tactics are used in every skirmish. The touted ability to control water doesn't even occur until right before the final boss, and at that point it really only seems to be there for that battle. What initially seem like clever and unique puzzles end up being recycled many, many times over the course of the game. With regards to level design, for a ship that is purported to be as large as a city, there are not many places the player gets to see that seem to have had much movement or life in them. The few room variations seen are mostly non-specific server-type rooms and innumerable hallways for the sake of filler. WIthout an in-game guide telling you where to go, it would be very easy to lose yourself amidst the incredibly similar rooms.Controls can be broken into three areas: water, surface, and climbing. Within the water, controls are jittery; hindered by a camera that is cumbersome and erratic, particularly near the water's surface. For a game with such a keen focus on water, having sloppy water controls is unforgivable. On the surface is where much of the combat is found, it is uninspired. Surface controls are heavy and tank-like, and it can be difficult to get out of the way of enemy fire once it starts. When climbing, objects that can be mounted or climbed on are almost always bright red, eliminating much of any thought while moving vertically in the environment.With regards to the writing, the main character and her unseen ally are unlikable. What I imagine the developers were going for was a protagonist/radio ally kinship like Lara/Zip/Alister had in Tomb Raider: Legend. However, between the writing and voice acting, hearing what any character has to say quickly becomes irritating. The game's overall plot manages to be confusing in its brief 3 hours. While it is clear that the ship you are on has been invaded by terrorists and you are trying to make it through said ship, anything beyond that is lost due to poor storytelling. While this game could have brought some interesting concepts to the action-adventure genre, the ideas that were to set it apart were poorly or badly executed, making this forgettable game one to pass on.

												Took a solid 30 minutes for me to encounter any water. Fire is more dangerous than the water is in this game. This woman has the lungs of a large sea cow and can stay under water for at least 15 minutes. The scariest part of this game is the clunky platforming.3/10 did not make me afraid of water.

												I really enjoyed my time with Hydrophobia. It got mixed reviews when it first came out, but apparently I purchased a later version that was patched on the xbox 360 and as far as that version, I really liked it. It ended too soon (story wise in the game), and now there will never be a sequel due to the company shutting down. But I still recommend it here. Especially for .50 cents! Jeez. I would easily pay $5 for this older game now, but for the cost of a soda, get it!			",275,65,8,39,55,4,43

												This game reminds me of Remember Me.  Even Kate has a similar voice with Nilin.  The only difference is that you're fighting the insurgents instead of you being the insurgent.  This game probably has the most impressive water effects of all time.  It's really a marvel at its best considering that water is usually the most looked over element in a video game.  In terms of gameplay it's just as lame but less straightforward as compared to Remember Me's, although not outright boring.  I haven't played the game that much, but I would recommend the game for its cheap price yet awesome graphics witch tolerable gameplay.

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy is a game with the best water physics I've ever seen in a game. However, that is the game's only strong suit.The story is dreadful, the devolopment and voice acting of the main character is just bad, and it is still very buggy(even though it's been out for a decent amount of time). In fact if you are unfortunate enough you're game might have a broken hacking sytem, which is essential to get through several areas of the game. The hacking system failed so badly that I was forced to play the console version of this game because the PC copy I got was broken even though I tried everything to fix it (including reinstalling the game and even trying to edit the games files).Even if this goes on sale for 99% off this game is NOT worth buying, you will regreat it immediately.

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy is a 3rd person action game by Dark Energy Digital. The game has some amazing water physics, but unfortunately that is all it really has going for it. The game play is mediocre and the platforming that the games throws at you is not very good. The graphics are decent, but not enough to justify the frame rate drops that I would get for no apparent reason on my 7870 O.C. It seems like the game was not optimized good enough and was not able to keep a steady frame rate on a decent rig. The story was fairly interesting, but not enough to carry the game for me. The voice acting wasn’t the worst that I have heard but it was far from being any good. I played the game for about an hour and decided to retire it. Time to move on to another game in my backlog, hopefully one that is fairly good this time.Pros:-	Amazing water physics. Some of the best that I have seen in gaming.-	Fairly interesting story.-	Funny characters.Cons-	Poorly optimized. I had constant frame rate drops on my overclocked 7870-	Poor voice acting for most of the characters.-	The Platforming is not very good.-	The combat is fairly Generic for what I have played of the game*Please note that I did not finish the game. I would recommend checking better sources from people who have finished*			",405,96,9,37,42,7,54

												I enjoyed this game well enough.  Some neat enough concepts (or takes on established concepts) in there with the MAVI and the ""Tower water power"".  I really enjoyed the absence of vile language and the non-sexualisation of the main character Kate, both dialogue-wise, and in her appearance.  There was no derogatory talk about women.  And it didn't bother me at all that there were no ""civilians"" visible in the game.  They weren't necessary.  Water effects were a bit strange, but were a fair attempt at reflecting fluid dynamics for that kind of enclosed environment.  Sufficient ammo, and a single weapon (disregarding the water power) ... and that was a pleasant change.  A nice and simple ammo-chooser interface.  Potential to use the environment against your enemies ... (classic exploding barrels everywhere!).  And there was a delightful absence of bloodiness ... with the exception of underwater shooting.  Boss level wasn't too hard.  I didn't find the story immersive, but I wasn't after that kind of experience anyway.  I just wanted a bit of a change from CoD and Skyrim ... and this was an enjoyable single evening's entertainment! ... especially in view of the current $5 price-tag.  Does the ""Prophecy"" part of the name point to a sequel?  I'd consider getting it if there was.  8)  Thanks, developers, for the effort you put into this game.  :DRead some other reviews now.  I didn't know this was an indie game!  Even more kudos to the crew!!!  8)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy doesn't really have anything going for it except for the water visuals. However, good looking water doesn't equate to a good game and that becomes painfully obvious within the first few minutes of gameplay. Zero character developement and a weak story do nothing to help the mediocre (at best) visuals and gameplay. There are plenty of cheap games that I'd recommend spending a dollar or two on.....but this just isn't one of them.			",27,4,0,5,2,0,1

												Starts off really promising with an interesting setting, rather intriguing plot and the promise of unique combat.Ends up being a cookie-cutter shooter with little extra mechanics. While the water looks rather well and the utilization is alright (the swimming mechanics I really liked, compared to many other games that make you swim and dive through areas) with the mechanics and the hydrophobia of the protagonist, hence the game's title, being displayed comprehensibly, the advertised water control mechanics only become available shortly before the game ends. Which means there is really little to be had, as the expected unique selling points are implemented poorly or just too late in the game.The developers are bankrupt, apparently, and it seems as if they ran out of money halfway through the game. I really feel like this game was either supposed to be a trilogy or just a lot bigger. But about 2 or 3 hours in the story leaps ahead, you have a huge room where you must fight many baddies and then suddenly a boss fight, a short and unsatisfying cutscene and then ... nothing. That's it. Nothing is really concluded, nothing really happened. It seems like a prelude to the actual game, which will probably never come.Might be worth a bargain price for the water experience, but otherwise expectations will probably fall short, as the game severely lacks substance.

												Ok, there were a lot of fun things about this game. I really enjoyed the first two acts. Especially the climbing bits, and I even got to enjoy the hacking, even though it was timed.Of course, there were quite a few reasons I'd say 'skip this game.' The plot goes from a pace of a car to a rocket jet by the third act. Once Kate gets hydrokenisis (not a spoiler since it's in the screenshots), you barely get any time to really get how it works before you're expected to use it for the boss battle. There are a whole lot of great things about this plot that aren't given a chance to be explained. Malthusians as the terrorists, with calvinist beliefs mixed in there (calling all non-malthusians 'reprobates' meaning doomed to die), an implied overpopulation, the idea Kate is living in a ship due to that... all great ideas, but never really explored to its true potential.I guess I wished for a first level like Half Life's, where the player wanders around Black Mesa and gets an idea of the place before everything gets crazy. The plot summary suggests there will be character arcs, and there aren't. The only thing that changes is that Kate stops yelling whenever she has to go balance on poles. Kate's goal changes inexcplicably part-way through (I suppose her boss being killed might have something to do with it, though he was a jerk to her anyway) from ignoring curing herself and finding her friend to chasing down the bad guy.And it just kinda... ends. This is one of those games where the controls sometimes flat out ignore what you tell it to. Which is especially frustrating considering how unforgiving it is. (There is no saving, just checkpoints.) On that note, this was another game where the hints couldn't be turned off, and they were always brought attention to by an annoying sound. I'm normally not bothered by voice actors, but Kate's voice actor was incredibly distracting. The fact is, this game does a lot of things right, which makes the things it does wrong even more frustrating. What a great world to just ignore.			",141,40,2,16,7,2,18

												I tried to give this another shot. Bad idea. Don't buy it.I once said it was not a bad game. Wrong, it is a bad game. Repetitive gameplay, useless extra powers, terrible checkpoints, terrible camera, and terrible physics. For those who really care, is also has terrible graphics, the only redeaming graphical element is the water, and it otherwise looks unimpressive.Voice acting is also mediocure and does not help the rest of the game. The villan is utterly unimaginative and cartoonish. The collectables are pointless, so they might as well should not even be there.I put it on easy just to get through it, even then the boss battle was brutal. As an example of the terrible checkpoint system, if you fail on this boss, once, they send back to the beginning. Even the fact that they force you to use the terrible extra mechanics in this battle make it all the more frustrating, not challenging. This is where I had to stop, I could not continue.The level design is also really bad, clustered, and full of dead ends. If it was not for the objective markers leading me along the linear path, I would have not known where to go. Linearity is OK, but not with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level design. This game has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level design. That is about all I can say on this game. I don't know the nature and resources of the dev team, but even with minimal resources a great game can be produced. This seems to me to be a project that was too big and too ambitious, and as a result just came out... bad. 10/10 for effort, 3/10 for execution.			",71,5,0,0,2,0,6

												This is a decent game with a few problems. It's basically a first-person platformer/shooter with water - lots and lots of water. It's also very short (a few hours), so keep that in mind as well. It has a lot going for it and is definitely a cool game and concept, but the mechanics and gameplay didn't quite meet my expectations. The controls, in particular, I felt were needlessly complicated. The game also didn't run all that well on my PC, despite other more recent games running just fine. Also frustrating was the final boss fight, which was way more difficult than it should have been due to the aforementioned control problems. I also experienced game-halting bugs at more than one point in my playthrough, which could only be resolved by restarting from a checkpoint (which thankfully, are placed liberally). In summary, the overall setting and concept is cool, but it is hampered by spotty controls and a few too many bugs and glitches for my taste. Worth checking out for cheap price.

Obviously it wasn't a lot of excitement, because I decided to write this review instead of finishing the game.Don't bother with this game unless you need to take the express train to Snoresville.

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy had the potential and an interesting enough story to be good. But it isn't. Crappy voice acting (and I mean horrendous; every time the characters spoke I hated them for subjecting me to their dreadful attempts at sarcasm and pathetic efforts to convince me that they REALLY were having a rough time), clunky gameplay and poor combat really destroy everything, afterall, there isn't much to a game if you cut those elements. I bought it on sale (thankfully) and it was a waste of $1.25. Don't buy it.Opinion:unLAWful			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As you can guess by the obscure sources combed for positive reviews on the game's main page, Hydrophobia is almost comically bad.  The game combines dodgy controls, overambitious promises (the signature ability to control water? It's unlocked at the very end of the game), cartoonishly evil villains, and inconsistent voiceacting with a setting and plot *just* interesting enough to keep you playing.I would recommend this game to anyone studying video game design, as it is a comprehensive guide on what to avoid.

												A fair game for it's cheap price, but in the extremly short time i did have with this game, i spent 30 minutes of it trapped in a wall. So that's always fun. Don't buy this game. Seriously, if you have five dollars (or more) go to the indie section and just avoid this game.			",121,7,0,9,9,1,4

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy is a 3rd person action game by Dark Energy Digital. The game has some amazing water physics, but unfortunately that is all it really has going for it. The game play is mediocre and the platforming that the games throws at you is not very good. The graphics are decent, but not enough to justify the frame rate drops that I would get for no apparent reason on my 7870 O.C. It seems like the game was not optimized good enough and was not able to keep a steady frame rate on a decent rig. The story was fairly interesting, but not enough to carry the game for me. The voice acting wasn’t the worst that I have heard but it was far from being any good. I played the game for about an hour and decided to retire it. Time to move on to another game in my backlog, hopefully one that is fairly good this time.Pros:-	Amazing water physics. Some of the best that I have seen in gaming.-	Fairly interesting story.-	Funny characters.Cons-	Poorly optimized. I had constant frame rate drops on my overclocked 7870-	Poor voice acting for most of the characters.-	The Platforming is not very good.-	The combat is fairly Generic for what I have played of the game*Please note that I did not finish the game. I would recommend checking better sources from people who have finished*			",405,96,9,37,42,7,54

												This game has very cool water physics effects. For instance, when you open a door, water from one room will flow into the other and be cut off once the door is shut. Then a wave will bounce back-and-forth across the room until it settles. But other than that this game is bad. It's a standard third-person cover shooter with awful aiming. Every now in then it adds in a hacking mini-game like from the Rocksteady Batman games, or a ""platforming"" element like Uncharted 2 & 3.The game is riddled with sound bugs, where character dialogue overlaps each other, or characters voices don't come from the correct world locations.The only unique thing about it comes in the last 10 minutes of the game when you get the ability to manipulate water. It's used for 1 puzzle and the final boss fight. That's it.If you love fighting juggalo-looking enemies using terrible shooting mechanics, bland stories, buggy audio, and bad voice acting, then you should play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would not recommend this game. It's really frustating, the combat is horrible and the optimization is pretty bad. The water physics are pretty fun but it's just there for show until the last 5 minutes of the game and the overall feel is underwhelming and kind of boring. It's also really short, i finished it in under 2 hours more or less and i died/got lost a lot of times. Story background is cool but never really developed, mainly you are a girl trying to escape a giant ship that was bombed by terrorists.Conclusion: Would not recommend to buy. The game is not fun, most of the time it's frustating and boring. The game suffers framerate problems constantly.			",344,84,7,51,21,3,49

Presentation:This game first presents itself to you with a semi-sci fi type world, I like it, anything with a futuristic sci fi world, even more so if it is original is great in my book.You're presented with a female protagonist in this game though, I don't like most games with exclusive female playable characters so that is a bit of a problem. She has a tomboy look going on from a design aspect but that doesn't help in her case because our protagonist is annoying and generic in this game due to poor writing. Her voice actor is terrible as well. Even worse than the voice acting for females in Guild Wars 2.So yeah, the world the game is set in looks nice and is well presented, the female protagnist though is generic and just not interesting.Concept:Very unique concept this game has, I like it. Water is the main elemental focus here, not many games do with the developers had in mind with this game.However, they obviously did something very wrong since the company who made this game went bankrupt and the game engine they designed for it.The gameplay is interesting at first, but ultimately it is just plain, bland, boring. The characters suck, Kate is a junk protagonist, her partner scoot or whatever his name is has halfway decent voice acting but he is boring as well. His animations are terrible as well.Gameplay:Interesting at first, gets boring though. The main aspect of the game, ""Water"" is not used as much as it should have been, since the developers made a engine based around real physics water the water powers you gain don't show up until late in the game, very silly move on there part to feature the main reason to play the game later on. It should have been available at the start or near the start of the game, would have been more interesting.Graphics:The game looks pretty on my fairly powerful rig, I was very impressed with the HydroEngine that the developers of this game made, they may have gone out of business but they deserve praise for there work on the engine at the very least, I like it.Sound:Not great, below par to be fair. Just doesn't seem good, voice acting is very terrible, music is generic, sound effects does have its moments of being good but most of it is junk, the enemy gun sound effects are a joke, something outta' a cheesy laser tag game.Story:The story is crap. Very basic but not in a good way, the female antagonist sucks, not interesting at all with her overplayed acting and predictable reasoning. Our heroine had potential to be pretty cool, but the voice acting, writing and animations are all pretty bad.Entertainment:The game doesn't have very much entertainment for the $9.99 asking price, I paid only $3.99 for a retail discount and even that seems a lot to ask for, ya know for something that is basically a tech demo for a great innovative game engine. The main reason to play the game would be for the neat water physics, no game has water animations quite like this game, much potential could be had if a major developer like Capcom or Namco got a hold of this engine, but that isn't the case.Replay Value:There is no value in replaying this tech demo, except of you want to experience really nice water physics.Conclusion:The HydroEngine has great potential, the developers should be proud they made a unique game engine with a strong focus on water, If the engine is up for sale, I hope the buyer is a well known or ambitious developer team because the potential to make a crazy hack n slash action game with rpg elements with a water wielding male protagonist seems like a great idea to me. I would love to work on such a project myself if I had enough money and talent to make such a thing happen, I think it would be a very unique concept for a market filled with so many generic first person shooting games.THE GOOD*Ambitious tech demo showing of a unique game engine.*Great and Innovative game engine, the HydroEngine is a unique idea with a poor tech demo showing it off.*Pretty graphics from a former indie developer, on max settings the game looks good. The water is the star though.*Fun physics in general.THE BAD*Main female protagonist is not likable, very boring, even if the character were male he would still be boring.*Bad voice acting from almost every character in the game.*Generic storyline.*Bad writing.*Combat is boring.*Platforming is boring.*Missions are boring.*Support characters are boring.*AI is extremely stupid.Score:4.4/10 ~ I do not recommend this game at the price point of $9.99, it is barely a game. If you can get it for under $5 I would still be very stand offish against it, but to experience the water in this tech demo might be worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll start by saying I did enjoy it but I can't fully recommend it.The story seemed good, the controls were fine, graphics acceptable.However, it's only a couple hours long. Basically as soon as you get used to the game and get into the story it seems like it's picking up the pace and building some suspense then just drops, end of the game, over all ready. If you can get it for $2.50 or less I'd recommend it but at full price no. I'm pretty hard on demands for gamelength and this surely didn't do it. If it had replay value that would be one thing but it really has none.			",40,1,0,11,0,0,1

												My feelings on this game are incredibly mixed. I bought it during a bargain sale when it was 0.49 euros because earlier i saw a trailer and liked it but didn't have the money. Graphics are great, no doubts there. The gameplay length is reasonably long for such a low-priced game. The water physics resemble From Dust's physics, and your character reacts to it as you would expect, you almost feel the water pushing against your body. However, the storyline is so incredibly dull that i didn't even play until the end. The combat is so simple that if you die once you truly must be new to the game. The game gives repetitive tasks and makes you walk past every place you go twice. Although it's camera hacking system has beaten Watch_dogs, you don't hack much aside from scouting the enemies and using terminals. It's only use is to find out where to shoot. It has so many enviromental ways to kill your enemies that you won't even need to shoot directly at anyone. You get a sound gun and don't even loot the enemy's guns after you kill them. All and all this game is a 7/10 at first glance, slipping to a 4/10 for repetitive and dull gameplay.			",96,21,1,21,6,2,9

												Mixed feelings about Hydrophobia. For the price that it often goes on sale, it really can't be beat. 0.50 for some great looking graphics and atmosphere, it certainly does the trick for that much. Why people are calling it a tech demo, I don't particularly understand. It IS a full game - there is a beginning, a middle, and an end. However, I can understand that being instantly thrown into the action with little explanation could grate on peoples nerves. I don't want to say it's Kafka-esque, because that would be giving the game far too much credit, however, the brevity of the story and the nature of it - you're more or less transformed into a bug in this huge maze and you're afraid of getting squished, I  can see some sort of draw to that sort of thing. The game does have non-stop, run faster, finishfinishfinish mentality that's lacking in many games. That doesn't always come across as a good thing. As it's been said before, the water manipulation is a pretty cool feature, but of course it could've been done better. It is smooth in terms of being visually appealing. My biggest issue? The controls. Maybe I'm just not used to third-person games, but pretty much this is the big mood killer. It really, really will frustrate you enough to break something that can be played in a single sitting into multiple play sessions, not because you don't enjoy the game visually, but because you're sick of having to press the exact thing in the exact 0.2 second timeframe they give you to do it. At times it works, at other times, it doesn't work at all. I give it big ups for having a female protagonist that isn't overly-sexualized. This is something people complain about all the time, and it's really not an issue here. The character is pretty, but not flawless and not the commonly associated ""Bimbo"" flavor you have come to expect from most action games of this type. No overly enlarged breasts, no bouncing wiggling parts for fan service, and the clothes are modest. I really, really do have to give the game points for this - it's something that's not seen often enough and is expected in nearly any game with a strong femal protagonist. The storyline is obtuse, I can't help but feel like there was probably more of an introductory chapter that got chopped out of the game, and that there was much more planned for it that never came to fruition because the development company went belly-up. It's like an early-release title that they just slapped on an ""Oh well, finished"" tag. They could've issued patches to make the controls less clumsy, they could've opened it up to be played around with and have mods created, they could've done multiple things - bankrupt or not, but they just didn't. And it's short. At most, on the hardest setting, you might get 8 hours of gameplay out of this, and that's only because you're going to die a LOT. Get used to dying, but then feeling really stupid when you figure out where you were supposed to go; it's  almost always completely obvious. This game had so much potential, it still DOES have so much potential, it's not ugly, the main character is pretty cool, the atmosphere is in high levels. Sure, I would recommend it for 0.50 - I would recommend it for 1.99 - but not for the full asking price. A very long, great start to something that just failed. On a final note - the voice acting is bearable. Except for at one point when Alex (The female protagonist) randomly switches to a full-on English accent from a rather non-descript American accent for no apparent reason whatsoever. This only happens for a few sentences, but it still had me shaking my head. If you get it on sale - pick it up, it IS an enjoyable play, but not without its flaws, and within the price range that it almost always runs (Cheap - Very cheap) I can't say I'm disappointed with it. If only they had been able to finish the game - again, it is a full game, I don't know where the tech demo comparison comes from - but opening it up to the community to make their own mods and patches, to create with it, could have possibly saved the company by making it a cult classic. Instead, it's an obscure budget game with atmosphere in bounds and some weird idiosyncrasies that would have taken almost no effort whatsoever to fix. So what happened? 6/10 - Like it, but won't play it again. Well worth it when it's on sale for 2.00 or under or if you get it in a bundle, otherwise, just play something you know you already like.

It also starts up and does not crash and does not have any bugs, control issues, or resolution issues, which is a lot more than can be said for some of these older games I have been buying and trying out. I got it on sale for 50 cents which was a killer deal for a game thats alright for a once-through, although honestly I just uninstalled it after a few hours since I have dozens and dozens of much better games. Catch it on sale only because it is just not a great game and there really isn't much to say about it. It's just one of those games that is alright if you are bored of all the much better games you have in your collection. 6/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Hydrophobia is all about water *duhuh ^^*. More precicely, Hydrophobia is a water physics game, and that's about the only thing it's really good at. The awesomely looking water physics make the rest of the graphics seem like they were made 20 years ago though. Not to mention the character animations - damn, they just suck.And story..? Well, I still have no clue what the background and main story is, other than get off that ship ASAP. I'm led through the ship by (what I guess) a collegue of mine. What's even more annoying is that you pick up a stun gun after a while, and the terrorists you meet walk around with shotguns. No problem there, but when you shoot them, you can't even opt to change weapon for their (more powerful) shotgun >:(All I can advice is DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless it comes in a bundle. Really, even €5 as it's priced now is still too much for this game!			",287,107,3,104,53,5,84

												What can I say about this game. This game tries it's hardest to make the game mechanics work like some big AAA game like Assassin's Creed, looking at the parkour mechanics, I think it actually tried mimicking Assassin's Creed. Now by mimicking, I mean flat out mimicing, like Shadow of Mordor level mimicking, I wouldn't be surprised if they took some of the coding out of an Assassin's Creed game and tried using it. Sadly, it doesn't work in their benefit, the jumping is terrible, I always end up falling and dying, the climbing is terrible, you can't even move the camera around while doing it, it just snaps back to it's original position. The enemies, oh my god the enemies, I'm going to make a list pointing out all the flaws of the enemy AI:1.) AIMBOOOOOOTS!!!!! Every single enemy has aimbots, no matter how far away you are from them, they will NEVER miss, and this gets even worse when you hear:2.) Enemy detection mechanics. The enemy will be able to detect you from literally a mile away, even if they're looking the opposite direction, they will spot you. This one time the enemy was on the other side of the room, I was in ""stealth mode"", and they were looking the opposite direction, they still turned around when I came out into an opening and shot me.3.) Knockdown. Whenever the enemy is shot with a near fatal strike, they fall over, now normally this would be fine if they put some icon over them to tell you that they aren't actually dead, but instead you'll walk away from them thinking that they died, only to be killed when they get right back up.4.) OP. Later on in the game you fight stronger enemies who have all these stupid traits on them, so not only do they have the sense of Peter Parker, they have the strength of The Incredible Hulk too.Back to the review, the game itself is very boring and tedious, you usually have no clue what you're doing, the gameplay is repetitive (Get to destination ""A"" and shoot bad guys along the way, maybe pick up a barrel), and also there's some more in depth things that break down the game as well. During the game, who am I kidding, I'm not even going to put a spoiler text in here, no one is going to care about this, during the game you unlock more weapons such as Gel Ammo, SMG ammo, Full Auto Ammo, and more ammo I didn't ever care to use because they're useless, the ammo you start out with is infinite and is more powerful than all the others if you use it correctly, so it's like you go throughout the whole game never feeling rewarded. The ""Stealth"" mechanic that they ""implemented"" into the game is literally useless, there is no such thing as 'Stealth' in this game (as I previously stated during my rant about how terrible the enemies are).Alright, let's list the Pros and Cons.Pros:-Amazing water graphics, maybe the best I've ever seen, also to pair with it has semi good water mechanics, to the point where it deserves it's-Good graphics for an Indie game-Decent voice acting-Boob physicsCons:-Boring gameplay-Glitches-TERRIBLE ENEMY AI-Gross animations-Repetitive objectives-The story isn't even thereI really wouldn't waste my money with this, even if it's on a killer sale.

												Oh dear oh dear oh dear, i'm so glad this game was only 40c when i bought it because it is definitley a stinking pile of dog doo doo. The controls are easy enough to get the hang of, but the story is like something from a Kevin Kostner movie, oh wait, it is. It's the ♥♥♥♥♥ier version of Water World. The voice acting is so damn atrocious it's actually funny. The characters are cliche and the cutscenes have objects randomly floating arond your character as if they're possessed. Don't buy this game, unless you're bored and want to have a good laugh, in that case, go right ahead and buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t space waster. Game: 1/10, comedic value 10/10.

												What can I say about this game. This game tries it's hardest to make the game mechanics work like some big AAA game like Assassin's Creed, looking at the parkour mechanics, I think it actually tried mimicking Assassin's Creed. Now by mimicking, I mean flat out mimicing, like Shadow of Mordor level mimicking, I wouldn't be surprised if they took some of the coding out of an Assassin's Creed game and tried using it. Sadly, it doesn't work in their benefit, the jumping is terrible, I always end up falling and dying, the climbing is terrible, you can't even move the camera around while doing it, it just snaps back to it's original position. The enemies, oh my god the enemies, I'm going to make a list pointing out all the flaws of the enemy AI:1.) AIMBOOOOOOTS!!!!! Every single enemy has aimbots, no matter how far away you are from them, they will NEVER miss, and this gets even worse when you hear:2.) Enemy detection mechanics. The enemy will be able to detect you from literally a mile away, even if they're looking the opposite direction, they will spot you.

												This is an excellent game and the bad reviews are unreasonable. Other reviewers seem to be expecting some weird super hero water power. That's really stupid. This is not a super hero game. This is a realistic game set in the future on a large ship. There is an element of mystery solving. You shoot bad guys and explore ways to escape. It's a fun game with lots of eye candy and ambience. I highly recommend it and certainly for the price, you can't go wrong.			",290,27,11,20,31,1,20

												 I do NOT recommend this game at all.It was fine for the most part with not many bugs or anything.I bought it on sale for just 0.99 euro but even that wont be low enough for some things in this game.Cause i paid so little i didnt really mind the worst voice acting i have ever heard in a game.I didnt mind the debris killing me.Didnt mind the game just spawning enemies right on top of me.But what i do mind is, you need to have V-sync on to make a specific jump to a ventilation system. Which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t btw.You could also screw up the cutscene in some places, specifically the one where you climb up to get to the jump.Press left to much and go up and you will trigger the cutscene before it should be and the character will drop down and die.So no, even with a sale so low as 0.99 its not even worth the money.But hey! If you want a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that is broken and you want to laugh at the bad voice acting. Then go for it!!			",136,18,1,38,5,0,5

I can't even get past the first part of the game, SHE NEVER JUMPS WHERE YOU WANT HER TO GO.  I'VE TRIED A KEYBOARD AND A CONTROLLER.  NOT ONLY DO YOU DIE, BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GO THROUGH A 45 SECOND CUTSCENE BEFORE YOU CAN TRY AND DIE AGAIN. THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. IF ONLY I COULD ACTUALLY PLAY AND PROGRESS THROUGH THE STORY MAYBE I WOULD CONSIDER A BETTER REVIEW.  Jesus Christ. I spent the past 45 minuites just TRYING to jump to the other side, only having to go through the same 45 second damnsel in distress cutscene again. Would not play again. Not worth my $.50 cents.

The PC version is more beautiful than the Xbox 360 version and if you compare this to the original version, you will be suprised by the changes that the development has tried to fix and improved. This is worth to try beside all those AAA games. The concept is great, the physical of water and others is great, gameplay is okay and the story isn't good buy not force your entertainment. If I have to give it a number score, it maybe 7,5 or maybe 8 in some reasons. The development always listen to their fan and this version of hydrophobia is really worth to buy.

The pistol you get is almost all you need, especially with the different types of ammo you can pickup. Making it to the part of the game where you get to control water is something I regret not doing in the past, it made the game so much more fun. I didn't have any issues with the graphics or the gameplay. I really liked the game and seeing it go down to $0.99 during Steam sales it's totally worth it. A heads up though, it's a pretty short game.			",945,281,41,116,102,12,123

However as the saying goes... It's not the end that counts, it's the road to get there. Which in Hydrophobia is a good road.			",260,75,6,50,43,0,67

												Hydrophobia Prophecy isn't very good. But before I get into why, it's not completely awful. Considering it's a 2010 game, the graphics aren't bad, though not amazing. But it's the water physics that is this game's shining crown and glory. The water flows, pours and ripples naturally, not too clear and not too murky. When you open doors or break glass with varying water levels, the water flows from one area to another in waves and levels out. Dark Energy Digital have produced a very good water physics simulator in their HydroEngine. It's just a pity they didn't put as much effort into the game itself.Why did I think this game was bad? Hydrophobia Prophecy aims to be a cover-based, stealth shooter, similar vein to Deus Ex but without the RPG elements. But the stealth elements are absolutely horrible as cover is the only real element that provides stealth. Because the stealth is so bad, the game becomes a generic, watered-down, cover-based shooter. You have 1 weapon with 5 different ammo (i.e. stun, single shot, auto-fire, remote detonation grenade and remote detonation shock grenade). Majority of encounters involved me shooting a guy enough times in the face before he killed me, waiting for my health to regenerate before moving onto the next guy.Hydrophobia Prophecy is only worth having a go if you're interested in water physics in games. Otherwise the game is not very well done due to many flaws and bugs, only being about 3 hours long, poor design and poor mechanics. Dark Energy Digital went under after low sales of this game, which is unfortunately what happens when you produce a sub-par game. More unfortunately is their response to some negative reviews which can be read about in this article. Looking at the title image below, don't get fooled into thinking this is an action game where you use your magical water power to defeat the bad guys. The below image represents about 8.5% of the game, 6% of that being an awful, awkward, out of the blue boss fight.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/10/03/hydrophobia-prophecy/ ",256,105,4,31,22,1,39

												First Impression Review of Hydrophobia: ProphecyThe first things I noticed when I  turned on this game were that the graphics were beautiful, the voice acting was impressive and my computer would never be able to run it properly in a million years.  After a few restarts and a lot of tweaking of settings I managed to get Hydrophobia to run by sacrificing the graphics and pretty much everything else.When the game starts, it throws you immediately into the story. Hydrophobia: Prophecy is set on a city sized boat called Queen Of The World, sometime during the mid 21st century. Queen Of The World is  having some sort of anniversary celebration (whether anniversary of it’s founding or anniversary of completing a trip around the world I’m not sure) and out of the blue, the main communications server goes offline. Kate Wilson, a systems engineer, goes to investigate. With communications down a terrorist organization called the Malthusians hack the main security computer and a series of explosions rip holes into the hull.Overall, the game seems quite well made with only a few minor bugs (some of the items float randomly when picked up rather than staying in your hand) and a dynamic liquid system that I haven’t seen anywhere else. However, one thing I can criticize is that the level design is quite confusing, often leading me to walk off in the wrong direction with little reward for doing so.As a summary, Hydrophobia: Prophecy is a promising title and from what I’ve seen in my 77 minutes in-game it is well worth its $5.00 price tag, despite its few issues.

												This game I would call more of a Show piece. yes the game is serviceable but its main focus is showing off the engine. The weapon your given has unlimited ammo as long as you charge it as the first ammo type you get and personaly I dont have a need for the other 4 types of ammo  with targets down in 1 or 2 shots. The story is borderline a Tom Clancy game, Everything is peaceful, terrorist f*** things up and you need to fix it. Though all this the main character actually just feels like her role before all the issues hit. She isnt a sharp shooter and on normal she is very weak, she feels and plays like a regular person(besides her ability to hold her breath). Control wise this game is almost poor. Walking and swiming feel clunky and if the water isnt deep enough to swim over but still too deep to walk around you get some intresting bugs. This game has a stealth system but if the water gets too deep you make a moan and alert everyone near by. so far the game preformed decent until Act 3. Act 3 i had my mouse not respond 3 times in a row from an awkward bug i got while swiming and aiming. Overall the game looks nice, i just wish the combat and movement were a little less clunky so I could enjoy it. Now here is my biggest issue, at the time of writing this I am 2.2hrs in and the game is ALMOST OVER. luckly I got this on sale and didnt pay the $5 (I think this is still $15 or $20 on Xbox). So beware this game is EXTREAMLY SHORT and your in for about a 3hr story and a challage room(which I havent tried yet). But if your a Developer looking for an engie to handle water physics this is wonderful engie to use and should give this a shot.			",152,16,2,12,6,1,11

												Tl;dr Some fun and interesting mechanics built over a competent shooter, sadly too short for it's own good but definitely worth the money.When I bought this game it was for $0.54 and I have to be honest I went in expecting to laugh at it... but I'll be damned if it didn't impress me. At first the voice acting (particularly the strange almost-but-not-quite-scottish accent on the main character) and some of the character animation had me convinced I was in for one of those games that's so bad it's good but this is actually a very competently done cover-based shooter with some neat core mechanics and interesting ideas. Firstly there's a kind of batman-esque vision device you can use to track your objective or interface with camera's and doors but it also let's you see digital graffiti and you need it to find some secrets, it was pretty well done and fit into the game well. With a title like hydrophobia you can expect to be doing a lot of swimming but the water gets used as more than another way to get around, you can open doors or shoot out glass to knock over or even drown enemies, you can shoot out bulkheads to make platforming easier or put out fires and there's a bit later in the game (far too late for my liking, you only get to play with it for about a half hour tops and that's if you waste time looking for secrets and dying to the boss) where you even get a small amount of telekinetic control over it. Sadly the game ends just as it hits its stride and with a fairly unsatisfactory conclusion, nothing really gets resolved... like at all, your character falls unconscious when you beat the boss and it cuts to credits.I only have a few minor gripes, for instance I dislike how you use ""ctrl"" to swim faster and ""shift"" to descend quickly while on land ""ctrl"" is crouch and ""shift"" is sprint. Also sometimes the climbing felt a little clunky and she refused to get in cover once or twice but it's still about as good as any of the recent tomb raider games so that's just nitpicking. Honestly you'll rarely need to use your other ammo types. The starting ammo is unlimited and has a charge shot that knocks most enemies out in one headshot while everything except the explosive jelly/electroshock bullets take far more. The score system isn't really neessary in my opinion, though it is kind of satisfying to get a chain reaction shot off and see your score rocket. Oh, using your environment is a big deal here, you're highly encouraged to shoot just about everything to get an environmental kill but the focus on that means you're literally wading through roomfulls of explosive barrels which can get kind of hairy. The story was okay, the actual plot wasn't anything all that new and it felt very rushed, things get introduced to you very quickly with little in the way of background explanation, but the villains point of view was interesting, a bit bioshock-esque except less subtle, they literally quote the guy they take after in their digital graffiti. I have to give serious respect to the dev though for having a way to give feedback in the main menu even if it is a little crude, more people should do things like that.EDIT: I forgot to mention that the checkpoints can be a little unforgiving at times, it could have done with a few more. There's one climbing section near the end where the object you're climbing shifts and knocks your character off without warning and I was too far over to grab hold again so I died, then it spawned me between four rather tough enemies.All things considered I would still have been happy with the experience if I'd payed full price and that's more than I can say for a lot of games, definitely pick this up if you want something fresh and interesting without a big time commitment. There's some replay value to try and beat your high score and do some challenge maps (which let you play with that woefully underused hydrokinetic ability) if you're into that kind of thing but you probably won't get more than ten hours out of it tops. If there were a sequel I would definitely buy it too, the mechanics need more room to flex and while the story is kind of ""meh"" I genuinely liked the support character, he made a couple references that actually got a laugh out of me and I want to find out what happened to him.

												This is an interesting game. It's bad but in the good way. It isn't exactly average since it has that little something. But it isn't great either. The water control mechanics are neat and are fun to play with but are in my opinion underused. The story is just okay. It has an interesting world but the game is short. The graphics are average but water is delicious. The combat works but could use some improvement. My main problem with the game is that it's so short. It has some neat things in it but overall it's just an average game in the grand scheme of things. But it has that spark in it. Potential.It is definitely nothing like you've ever played before but it is definitely worth a try for anyone even remotely interested in it.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 3/5Gameplay: 3/5Challenge: 3/5Discovery: 2.5/5Replayability: 2/5Aesthetics: 4/5Visuals: 3.5/5Atmosphere: 3/5Music: 3/5			",112,13,8,16,16,1,21

												Fairly good game so far but i think i am going to have to quit playing it until i can upgrade my hardware as i was plagued by slow down and lagging even a crash or two due to the sheer amount of water effects even when everything was set to the lowest possible settings.So if your hardware is even slightly ""outdated"" maybe you don't want this game,but if its ""high end"" i recomend giveing it a try. The game is really cheap even when its not on sale (i bought it for like 1 dollar during a steam sale) so really nothing to lose.			",68,2,0,17,1,0,7

												I recommend this game but only when its on sale not for full price.The graphics are great and the water elements have been done very well, The option to use Mavi for navigation is really good and the character models arent bad either. The bad points of this game have mostly been said already but the length of the game is too short, the water powers are few and unimaginative, most of the gun ammo types are useless, the enemies are idiots (seriously quite a lot of the time a few of them would just stare at the ceiling) and quite frankly the story escalated immensely quickly and didnt make a lot of sense, the location was also confusing was I on a boat, a city, a city that was a boat i couldnt say. Even with all that i definitely think it is worth the 39p that it is going for at the moment I mean there are some games out there not even worth that much *cough* Ride to Hell *cough*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this on sale, and it was worth what I payed. After completing the first level, with naive optimism that it might get better, the game stopped working. I couldn't load my save file, and when I reached the end of the level, the game crashed. What I did play was... lackluster, for lack of a better term. I took my time, watched the cutscenes, and all I could think is ""why am I supposed to care?"" Normally, I would give a game an hour or two to give me a reason, but the 15 or so minutes of gameplay didn't do it, and the cutscenes just gave setup for a promising story. But then the fire nation attacked then the terrorists bombed everything. The game was more interesting as a setting (city on a ship, dystopia, etc.) than it was as a game.3/10, made me buy it.

												If you took Dead Space, minus anything scary, and Mass Effect, minus any semblance of plot, and combined them together you would still have a better game than Hydrophobia: ProphecyThe controls are clunky, the puzzles add up to either ""swim up/down"" or ""jump to ledges and hope the game decides you grabbed them""Any ""plot"" in this game could be summed up by saying ""Die Hard on a Boat in the Future""The voice acting is the sort of dull surprise and awkward shouting that plagued every bargain bin adventure game in the last two decades.I'm trying to find a worse use for five dollars, but even burning them would at least provide some warmth.

Until i meet Hydrophobia: Prophecy. A game with fine graphics and a amazingly well designed physical enviroment where water really has a great purpose. 4.99 is not alot to price this and personally it should cost more. The game is short but yet still fun. Even if i did get angry in most sections... Hydrophobia: Prophecy is soo good i even brought my brother a copy in happyness towards this game. There are no sequels i am aware of sadly but I'm sure this game will make its way back.			",205,17,1,16,15,1,11

												Eh, my experience with this game was bad, but probably because i went in with a bad mindstate. The beginning of the game was kinda rushed i guess, you wake up, grab tablet, go to work, then sh*t goes down, in 2 minutes, you're already in a sinking ship. I just felt that it was rushing you.Now, oh GOSH the lag on this game. I have it lowest settings on an almost brand new laptop and it STILL lags.From what looks like a selling point on the screenshots, you can control water, YES, but um... for the last 10 minutes of the game.... so nvm about that.And as everyone is saying, final boss makes no sence to the story, but my thoughts on the final boss is F*CK THE FINAL BOSS, either my game glitched, or im misunderstanding something, but the enemies that the boss spawns are for some reason invincable for me, and i don't want to have to deal with it.So overall, i'd say the game isn't bad, but it's not good either. It can be fun at times, but sometimes what you're supposed to do isn't exactly clear. It's fun to relieve the Titanic in a futuristic way, but this time with a bad final boss.7.8/10 Too much water			",290,51,6,29,25,2,28

												I wish there were more open ended type puzzles that actually involved interacting with the water physics. All of the puzzles could be made in a game with no neat water physics. This makes the water (the main feature of this game) kinda just something that is there but dosen't really matter to winning the game. on the positive side: I got it dirt cheap on sale and it was some nice eye candy for a few hours, so I will recommend this game (if you can get it on sale.)

												It's a game about water.If you care about water play this game.If good water is all you need for a game to be perfect, this game is for you.don't listen to the bad reviews they don't talk about water.Water is life, therefore this game is life.Just like in the name, Hydro means water...it has water in the title. The ground is wet in the game. not everywhere, only where there was water.the game's location is on water.you are a water engineer.Water is important.Drink water.by playing this game, you will get thirsty. and then you will drink water. Water is good for you.since water is in the title.This game is good for you.Play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lets get right down to it, is Hydrophobia: Prophecy bad?Mechanically its ok, it works, the level design is solid, the water physics are frankly FANTASTIC, and overall the game functions pretty well. This game isn't a buggy mess or unfinished or a slog as I would have expected from the score.Storywise however it could use some work, the dialogue could use some improvement especially in the introduction which has some very shakey voice acting. Combat is somewhat repeditive and an unituitive puzzle required me to shoot some dangling electrical cords right next to some explosive barrels instead of the barrels themselves.Overall though after asking myself ""Would this be worth five bucks?"" If you can ignore the introduction and don't really mind the plot then I would say this game is definately worth five bucks. Especially the first time you open a door from a flooded room and realize ""holy crap this water isn't pre-animated.""			",440,91,6,81,46,2,87

												I find the environment and  game mechanics from this game worth the 5 dollar price tag. The game is short, but even there, is fun and rewarding. (8 hours for me an still going, some people report 3.5/4 hours,don't get the game rushing thing) If you play with a gamepad everything works as it should, the covering system even working better than some triple A titles. The water environment works ok in 2 aspects -> The interaction with the water (besides diving / swimming you can even ""use"" it later on the game)-> The ""oppression"" you feel most of the time, due to the fact that it's a sinking ship Overall, the game justifies the price and it's fun to play. I cannot talk about keyboard / mouse control on this title, since I tend to play all of these game types on game pad from my coach. I guess graphics are ok, but it's not a primary thing on my list. This game gets on bundles often, I say is a plus for the bundle.  ",511,163,9,129,40,3,115

												Let's cut too the chase. Hydrophobia is a broken, janky game. Gameplay is finicky, the A.I. is poor, the story is confusing, the acting is inconsistent at best, the deaths are always cheap and its terribly short.And in the end, I don't think I care about any of that.Hydrophobia may be a foundementally flawed game, but it succeeds in delievering an experience you have never encountered in a game. It reminds me a lot of games like Free Radical's 'Second Sight' of EA's 'Mirror's Edge'; both are nowhere near perfect games. But because they offered up a gameplay experience or asethetic distinct from what we as gamers are typically given, makes them capivating and brilliant in their own right. So yes this games is a mess, but for the moments when everything comes together you can't help but find yourself completely taken into the world.			",118,44,4,5,5,2,9

												I own both the Xbox 360 and PC versions and running them side-by-side, the PC wins hands down. We wouldn't have Hydrophobia if it wasn't for the Xbox Live to give this indie crew a chance, but man... the story depth has really been cleaned up on the PC version and while I really enjoyed what was already there with the X360 version, the addition of the cutscenes is a blessing: it adds so much more to the tension. Graphics have been improved, sound has been improved (though I disagree with replacing the voice actor for Scoot: the original was much better!), controls are open for both gamepad and mouse/keyboard (both with their pros & cons) and the gameplay has benefit a lot from the extra time/funding the development team had for this version. Yes, it's still a work in progress (dev team has added an in-game feedback option for PC gamers), but dammit: you _must_ buy this game. Adventure/action lovers rejoice: Kate knocks the old Lara Croft right out of the park.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hydrophobia is a third person action game. The water physics are beautifully done and it's always fun finding new ways to kill enemies.The gameplay got a little stale for me after about 30 min though. It has great potential the combat feels a little forced most of the time and the controls are difficult to master.I'm only recommending this game because of the low price. At less the $5 it's worth a play through, but I wouldn't pay anything over that.			",115,43,1,9,9,2,10

Furthermore, the story is well presented although there are a tad bit too much cut scenes than absolutely necessary, especially in the beginning but later in game there are less. In my opinion the cost/quality ratio is super since it only costs €5, Overall I think this is one of the best purchases in my library.			",395,79,5,33,44,3,50

												Nothing more than a tech demo to be frank. The water is night, but even on the highest settings the overall ""view"" is slightly blurred when AntiAliasing is switched on, implying that they went for an easy AA method instead of a nice crisp non jaggy method.As for the gameplay; there is very little. At first you feel ingenious using Security Systems and such, but it wears thin and gets stale and repetitive as you realise youve been doing it for the whole Act.One to miss.

I cannot talk about keyboard / mouse control on this title, since I tend to play all of these game types on game pad from my coach. I guess graphics are ok, but it's not a primary thing on my list. This game gets on bundles often, I say is a plus for the bundle.  ",511,163,9,129,40,3,115

												It was very short game, but quite fun. I liked the water power you gain in act 3. Overall, I got that game on sale for $0.50 and for that price it was a bargain worth playing. At that price I would recommend that game all the way up to $10.00. It was quite fun.			",110,37,2,39,11,0,18

												Score: 9 out of 10.For an action game that I never heard of, it's actually pretty good. The blend of fire and water that is used within this game sets it apart a little, at least I think so. Worth checking out if anyone is wanting to try something new or different.

												Ok, this game has some AMAZING water effects.  Water flows very much like it would in real life.  It even has a tide that will pull you if you are caught in the current while water is flowing out of your room into the next.Unfortunately, that's really all this title has to offer.  The acting makes B-movies sound like emmy award nominees.  And get this...2 hours!  That was the playtime to get through it.  I didn't even realize it was over till I started getting awards for ""Game completion"".  So that is a terrible ending to a story when you are sitting there expecting to see the next level.

												Let's cut too the chase. Hydrophobia is a broken, janky game. Gameplay is finicky, the A.I. is poor, the story is confusing, the acting is inconsistent at best, the deaths are always cheap and its terribly short.And in the end, I don't think I care about any of that.Hydrophobia may be a foundementally flawed game, but it succeeds in delievering an experience you have never encountered in a game. It reminds me a lot of games like Free Radical's 'Second Sight' of EA's 'Mirror's Edge'; both are nowhere near perfect games. But because they offered up a gameplay experience or asethetic distinct from what we as gamers are typically given, makes them capivating and brilliant in their own right. So yes this games is a mess, but for the moments when everything comes together you can't help but find yourself completely taken into the world.			",118,44,4,5,5,2,9

												First off...it's a short game.  But it's an interesting game as well that has a bit of challenge too it.  The game has a variety of aspects to it: a bit of puzzle solving, a bit of shooting, a bit of creepy giggling dead girl (stay underwater for a while...you'll start to hear it), and of course...water physics (and of course no game with a female protagonist can avoid the all mighty overamped boob physics).  The water actually reacts in what seems like a realistic way including waves rolling through and walls of water flowing down hallways when doors are opened.  It's a great game if you're waiting for a new game to come out and need something to hold you over for several days.  Definitely worth a look.			",38,3,0,10,7,1,12

												Honestly? As fun as this game gets to be at the end (at least, somewhat), the main ability that causes fun in the game, namely being able to manipulate the water and stuff in it, comes really close to the end, is quite limited, and it doesn't give you a whole lot of time to adjust to it. That's what really hurts it in my eyes. If they gave you more time with that power, more variations on it than just a pillar of water (possibly even puzzles with a 'parting the seas' kind of thing), and a bit more puzzling than shooting, it'd be amazing. As it stands, slightly meh. The ammo, while giving variety, is mostly useless. You only have to use one of the four extra ammo types at the very end, and I found myself using the default (and infinite, and chargeable) ammo type.Something I would have loved to see is a large area or two where you could get to play with the water manipulation, have it be more central to a puzzle than 'Move box, throw bomb, etc', and just more variation on the power.It's rather short, kinda worth it at bottom sale price, but it's not as stellar as it could have been. It's just a side effect of dated tech, really.In general:Environment: Captures the feel of a dying ship quite well.Story: Leaves A LOT unanswered and feels kinda flat at the end.Gunplay: Works well enough from what I played, variation mostly underused.Movement: Works very well, though a bit tedious to move through water that's just about at swimming depth at times. Swimming is nice and fluid.Ability: Fun, but not enough time to get used to it, nor enough done with it.Graphics: Good enough, but I'm not the type to insta-praise graphics that try to be ultra-realistic for the time.Water Physics: Best. Just.. You can tell that's were a lot of effort went when developing the game.Overall? Par for the time, minus a good bit for the lack of puzzle variety and power utilization, plus a bit for the water physics.5(ish)/10. If you're looking for a decent game for about a dollar (during the current sale), feel free to get it. Just don't get your hopes up too high.Review system: Meh/Bleh. Needs a more.. Precise thing than just Yes/No for reccomending it. But then again, I'm just asking too much from Steam there.			",137,15,5,21,30,2,33

												Hydrophobia is a game that's got great gameplay and a decent amount of puzzle solving.  Sadly, though, it runs out of both pretty quickly.  A few more mechanics would have made it amazing, but it works with what it has.  This leads onto the game's major flaw: Hydrophobia is very short.  One can understand why this is, though, the game's levels explore its limited mechanics thoroughly, and more would have become repeditive.The controls are a little bit awkward, it's clearly a console port and doesn't handle keyboard and mouse so well and has some weird accelleration.  It also ran my laptop very hot with the settings turned up to mid-high, but there wasn't much stuttering.  The game could probably be optimised somewhat.  If the developers had have spent more time polishing the game, it would have been quite excellent.Overall, it's an entertaining little game.  Don't expect it to be taken away by it, but it's worth the few dollars you'll pay for it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finished this game because I hadn't done it yet. If you like puzzles  with some combat to spice it up get this game and then don't play act three. They shoehorn in combat for the sake of combat in this chapter and the game wasn't built for it. there's movement lag, the controls are clunky, the enemies seemingly appear from nowhere on the final boss, and the boss itself is so frustratingly difficult not because its challenging but because they throw endless soldiers at you that do way to much damage are way to accurate and appear literally beside you. That and they throw new power at you that you haven't had time to practice with. Don't worry though, if you do decide to finish the boss fight will give you plenty of practice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright guys,Personally I felt this game was extremely badass for the price (got it on a steam sale for like $2.99). Honestly, the story was pretty good and the plot was interesting. Where it really fell short for me was how long the actual story mode was. You can beat it in a few short hours with not a ton of effort. Personally I am happy I bought this game, and it is one of those that you will play about once a year just to beat it again and be reminded of the story. I'd rate this game 4/5 stars because the concept is really cool, it just simply does not give you enough game to explore and get in depth into the story.			",78,1,2,0,3,2,7

												The game looks beautiful and the water physics are very well done. The platforming and puzzles are not too confusing and feel rewarding. However the story was rather short, only 4 hours or so and it leaves a lot left for the player to think about as the ending is confusing and felt rather rushed. The combat works pretty well, with cover mechanics and different ammo types, along with the power to control water which is great fun. The combat can feel rather awkward and clunky sometimes as the enemy AI is usually stupid. The guns didnt really sounds like guns either, more like someone making the sound effects with their mouth, but overall the combat was pretty fun.In conclusion I think Hydrophobia is a good game for what it's worth (5 bucks, currently 99 cents as I write this review), and looks very very nice. However A sequel or an expansion would be great to fill up those plot holes. I do reccomend this game if you want some thing short, fun, cheap and well designed.			",1084,318,60,87,121,13,129

												From all the screenshots, you'd think this would be a decent looking game. Well...it isn't. It REALLY isn't. I will admit that some of it looks alright but most of it looks like it's from a early ps3 game. The combat system just doesn't work. It feels messy and unfinished. You'd think this is early access but it isn't. Mind you, it was quite cheap when I got it but to be honest, that should have warned me as to the quality of the game. I'm just puting this out there to say Do not buy this game. Whatever little money it's asking for, it does not deserve. I'd understand the level of quality from this if it was a free mod for a game that someone made quickly in their spare time. The voice acting is mediocre at best. That few bits of money you still have in your steam wallet is better of staying in there than going into the pockets of this creator. Highly disapointed with this game			",74,13,0,16,1,0,1

												I hate this game.  The gameplay is a boring combination of platforming and shoddy 3rd person shooting in a lame sci-fi ship setting.  I found the main character's voice acting a bit annoying sounding.  Your main weapon is a weird charging beam that one shot's all enemies when you charge it so I don't really know why there's actual ammo when you kill everything in one hit.  The game's main draw is water physics, which is underwhelming.  The water is still scripted to only fill rooms at certain parts and while not annoying, doesn't really add anything to the experience.  The graphics are subpar and the game chugs pathetically at times for no reason.  Only worth $1 or less.  The game is also only 3-4 hours long.			",695,197,31,84,68,8,87

												Great game, has some bugs but it's nothing hugeYou might get the impression that it's a horror game, but it's really not.+ Pretty nice graphics+ Good story and alot of talking+ A fun adventure game- The voice acting is OK but not great.- Awkward camera angles+/- Short, but I like short and for the price, it's really worth getting.I give this a 7/10.

												Impressive for an indie game. Like any TOMBORAIDAR, you regularly have to struggle with camera/control clunkery (water hits you? controls bork; at the point between 'above water' and 'under water', the controls and the camera just do what they want), some jumps are a bit annoying, f.ex. when it's unclear how much of the area you can jump off of you can still use as ramp and then if you jump early you fall and die and get to re-climb some dumb walls, and if you jump la... waaaaah abyss. But it's definitely worth the very little money it costs here, you'll get some jolly hours out of it.			",3367,1279,127,344,499,39,549

												Hydrophobia Prophecy is a mediocre game in most aspects and even bad in few. Story and characters are completely forgettable. Pacing is solid, although it is pretty short game (not sure if that is positive or negative). Gameplay mechanics are ok, but controls can be a bit confusing. Sound and music also completely forgettable. 4/10			",286,100,6,60,33,1,81

												Overall decent B shooter game, with TONS of cutscenes. You have to overcome first 30 minutes into the game, which will be straight up awfull, but after that, game will show it's strong parts.Strong parts are: water effects, interaction with items (shoot off wires to stop electricity in water), hacking (match up aplitude waves), scanning device which let's you see hidden messages and unlock door/use cameras (sort of Watch Dogs style), interesting ammo types + their use and randomly funny dialoges of main character with her friendStory exists, but don't expect mind blowing plot. Let's say it will keep you playing:)			",322,72,7,17,15,2,27

												I got this game for like $3.  Is it a flawless game?  Absolutely not.  It's decent.  I'd go so far as to say it's even ""good""...but not outstanding, by any means.  It has provided a few hours of fun and, considering I got it dirt cheap, I figure that's more than a fair trade off.   I mean, if I had paid $20 for this game I would probably be disappointed, but for $3 it was a steal.  If you can find it on sale, it's worth buying and playing around with.  Have fun with it.

												The most braindead main character i've ever witnessed. Voice acting almost as bad as Ride To Hell: Retribution, tedious to use/straight up bad controls. Little to know explanation or direction as to who these characters are, where you even are, and barely any character development. On top of all of that nonsense, the game just isn't fun and has one of the worst opening sequences i've ever seen.			",342,58,10,34,20,3,40

												If you buy this game, I will disown you. This is by far the worst video game I've played this generation (And I once destroyed a copy of Alone in the Dark in my driveway). It's not worth any money. It is a miserable waste of time that will make you feel bad. Friends don't let friends buy Hydrophobia. If it's in a bundle, don't buy the bundle. If it's gifted to you, reject the gift. Avoid it with all of your lifeforce.			",567,256,24,62,48,8,56

												This game is a very strange thing, because most of the reviews don't apply to it anymore. They have a system in their game where you can just... pause it and send in feedback at any time for any reason. Half the intro has been removed, they replaced a bunch of voice actors, all kinds of things. It's not the greatest game in the world but it's pretty nifty and the water's cool. Get it for a buck or something when it next goes on sale.			",565,260,11,121,74,5,145

http://hereberants.wordpress.com/2014/11/10/hydrophobia-prophecy-2010/When loading up the game I seemed to have selected the ‘Looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ option and everything is pixelated it’s literally maxed out on all the graphic settings and it still looks like a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game for some reason doesn’t like to default to my screen size so I got 420p rather than 1080p but even after reloading and sorting this still looked a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The menu screen as well is extremely small and I can’t read any of the options I’m going to assume the top one is start and the next one down is continue.The intro was alright I seemed to have skipped straight to the end because my character was floating in water and I thought ‘Wow this looks good, how do I move, oh wait it’s a cut scene…’ Then a cardinal sin was committed, a jump scare, jump scares are cheap, cheaper than the developers mum on a Friday night, it wasn’t even scary there was a scream and a face really close up.I wake up from a dream having been scared by myself in the dream and then the telly is all like ‘EVERYTHING IS AWESOME, LOOK YOU’VE BEEN HERE TEN YEARS WOOO GO WHEREVER WE ARE’ and then my TV cuts out. And so my adventure begins. Seriously your TV breaks and Kate (the protagonist) effectively assumes terrorists.I didn’t know what was happening nor the urgency of the matter and so I endeavoured to examine my living quarters. My character has an obsession with pillows and chairs because those were the only things I could find, going upstairs that is all there is to play with, pillows. Considering she lives on her own with very few misc. possessions which I can get points for picking up. I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do with the things I pick up and look at, let alone the points I gain, it’s all very confusing. For 40p I didn’t expect much but the games loading screen showed me magical powers and by Jove I’ll get those powers if it kills me (get it, because that was a spoiler!). The physics engine known as the HydroEngine assuming was specially made to measure for this game, it doesn’t do character models very well but it does damn fine pillows and water, and there is lots of water, don’t worry if there isn’t much water yet, that is main plot we didn’t forget about that. Obviously trying to get their money’s worth out of it.While running around my apartment I noticed the controls handle like a lubed up whale made of bricks being directed through a needle by Michael.J.Fox (I’ve been waiting to use that for a while now). Because turning round takes a good second and then Kate stops and turns making it difficult to see where one is going, since it is third person and the camera is controlled by the mouse and movement by keyboard. There is an interface system called MAVI that can detect and use things at a distance as well as being used as part of the hacking mini game, which I quite like it is a relatively easy thing to do and shouldn’t be. I don’t want to spend 20 minutes playing a minigame to unlock something in a chest like Fallout 3 I want to do it to progress the plot like in Bioshock Infinite, but I actually have to do something unlike Bioshock Infinite.Okay so part of the intro is to go and look out at the city from my balcony, the render distance was appalling and I didn’t see very much there were about 5 buildings in my frame of view and this was supposed to strike awe into me, they failed miserably.You seem to have an assistant that talks to you over your earpiece and he sounds very stereotypically American and his voice acting is terrible, he sounds like he should be a voice over for a failing Michael Bay movie. My character seems to mixed nationality being part; Brit, Aussie, South African and USA. This makes it sound like she’s winey and in need all the time though her voice acting isn’t too bad considering.Note: I had so much beef I wrote 5 pages of notes on why I don’t like this game compared to half a page on Bioshock Infinite, perspective people.Kate wondering why her TV has shut off she wonders on down to security to check everything is okay and the lift she is in blows up. Bearing in mind she is a low level engineer at this point, then the areas she is in starts to flood and she must navigate her way to security to find out what is going on, like I have said I really like the water physics in this game, I think more time needs to be spent on the gameplay rather than the engine so any subsequent game that bothers to put the time in, to use this engine might be something worthwhile.When I first started coming in contact with areas that were parts of the map where destroyed the first scream that I heard without a shadow of a doubt was a full blown Wilhelm scream. I felt like giving up, this was one of the many things that made me want to just throw down my mouse and leave, despite the game being like a 5/10 at this point and showed no sign of deterioration. This is where♥♥♥♥♥♥went downhill.After getting to security and finding the footage of terrorists there was a Lara Croft style balancing challenge where you must walk across a beam in order to unlock the door or something. The balancing wasn’t hard it’s the fact that I could jump across the beam in half the time by spamming space for a bit, the fact I can do this annoys me to my very core.My next beef came in the form of an lift shaft I couldn’t get up because when I climbed any further Kate rag dolled and died because the lift fell down, and I had to hear the same ‘my arms are shaking!’ line about 12 times before I said ♥♥♥♥ it and Googled the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it, and I discovered a steam forum dedicated to taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game.I figured it out you have to shimmy along a bar, you then climb into a room behind you that you can’t see because camera angle is awkward, logic. The next challenge I faced was breaking the head of security out of burning room that was difficult because my waypoint was set to somewhere I couldn’t reach.I entered a hallway where the waypoint had told me, that had jets of fire coming out of the ceiling on both the left and the right, as well as the floor caved it. My approach was to shimmy around a space to the right where there was slightly more floor. The screen washed out and I died and the guy on the headset went ‘Kate are you alright?’ she’s fine mate just a bit dead. My second try was to jump across the gap when the left fire jet stopped for a second then continued. I jumped across the jump arch was long enough to clear the section but I rag dolled and died again for no apparent reason. The next ten minutes was then spent trying to clear this gap in the two ways just specified. I then stopped playing admitting defeat. This made me feel bad and I re-entered the game in the hopes of finding a solution, after climbing to a different part of the map, I discovered that the actual pause screen map was 100% three dimensional, this made me feel better. It turns out that rather than any solution being obvious to see there was a bar you are supposed to shimmy along on the left… I entered the corridor from the left this means my camera is facing right, so I won’t see that bar unless I run around in circle and see the bright red bar on the pale green/blue wall (bearing in mind I am RED GREEN colour-blind). I then proceeded to shimmy across, I made sure that the when the jet had finished I didn’t go onto the glowing section of the bar I was holding on to and waited for it to cool down. It doesn’t cool so I waited thinking Kate would burn her hands on the glowing white metal bar, but turns out she is resistant to heat completely unless they are flames, then you’re in trouble.

												Effectivly a tech demo for water physics, this game actually uses that to it's advantage.Physics based puzzles make up most of the core gameplay, and while the plot is a little weak, i found myself returning to it over and over.Give it a go, it might suprise you.

												Well, I read alot of reviews saying that the game pretty much sucks.  It does not suck.  Despite the bad reviews I couldn't pass it up on sale for $0.49.  This game has some neat features in it.  The main issue is that there's really no need to use the neat features.  The game is very linear so there's never an opportunity to experiment using different abilities to clear an area.  What I liked: The use of fire, water, electricity, gravity was done pretty well.  The manipulation of world objects wasn't really as limited as most games.  If you see a box it can be moved, thrown, blown up, etc.  You can use bad guys and world objects equally to create havok.The animations were pretty good.  The character struggled through hip deep water, sloshed through knee deep water, and gasped for air appropriately.  The character acts like it's running out of air when the breath meter gets to a certain point (swimming more erratically and paniced) Cover animations were decent and there were even fairly good proximity animations which alot of games tend to ignore. (Stand close to fire and the character shields her face.)The story wasn't blockbuster but was fast paced. There were a lot of cutscenes too, which I'm a fan of.  I want to see things unfold, not just hit a button and proceed.  Makes it more cinematic.What I didn't like: The boss fight was challenging but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Also slightly confusing.The level design was pretty weak.  There isn't really any sense to the layout of this place.  Two achievements are for 1. getting all the objects and 2. getting all the medals.  There's no indication of how many you missed.  As far as I know there's no list of medals that can be obtained either. You just play and try to get them?  Not cool.You couldn't use abilities creatively enough.  You get a chance to open doors with hazards behind them as a learning part of the story, but then really never get to do it again.  Using the handheld tool you can see if there's water or fire or nothing behind a door but if it's off the path it's either locked or malfunctioning which means it might as well just be another wall.  You can shoot out glass doors, which is great fun, but pointless since there's nothing to do but then just move on content with the knowledge that you just shot a door.The bad guys weren't intelligently placed.  They just kind of showed up in places that made no sense here and there to make you shoot things.  The bad guy placement was so bad that the majority of boss fight baddies can be left to the boss to take out.All in all it's another linear shooter.  If it's linear, and a shooter, 99% of the time it'll also be generic.  It'd be worth it at $9.99.			",45,3,0,3,1,0,2

												Graphics: Feels unfinished. too often do i stare at things that only slightly feel out of place. It is however, not bad. Especially when it comes to the water! The water itself would get a solid 10/10, rest of the graphics 6/10, mainly due to the poor cutscene dialogue's (I CANNOT stand impropper lipsyncing).(8/10 Total)Audio:Audio often weirded me out. I understand that the childs voice you hear underwater is PROBABLY from your trauma as you near suffocation underwater.... but hearing them the moment you jump into the water?The voice used for Kate does not feel authentic either.(4/10 total)Story:A horribly generic--- yet enjoyable storyline. The thing is however, that if you'd cut the whole story out, you would not be missing anything essential. The game feels seperated from the story (this may differ if you're a true collecter of collectables and learn more about the backstory). This does not matter however, seeing as the gameplay itself is of great quality.(7/10 total)Overal:The game plays very well, it also has a GREAT feel to it. It does feel a bit unfinished however and i'm sure that with just a bit of polishing it would be perfect feel-wise.Is it worth playing? Yes.Is it worth buying? Maybe. If it's on sale like it is now (-80%, 0,99 cents from 4,99) then yes, definately. The full price of 4,99 however, is barely worth it, seeing as the game is rather short (Completed in under 3 hours)I do however, hope for a sequal to come out in which the audio/graphics are fully polished and the game lasts -+20 hours, which in my opinion, should be easily doable since some of the technique's you unlock at the end (no spoilers) will only be used for puzzling once or never.If they manage to do all that, the game would be worth at least 29,99.Final Score 7/10.

												I love this game. BUT there is no ending. You beat the boss and then the game just ends. No final cutscene. no resolution. I REALLY want to know what happens to the main characters. And the game is very short. I would love if the devs remade the whole game using todays technology and polished up the story. That being said this game is incredible for the time it was made. I still have yet to see a game that models water was well as this game. Wish there was a part 2.			",110,27,4,4,13,0,18

												An interesting game with really amazing water physics, but it's unfortunately lacking in some other aspects. But for the low price it went down to, it's a bargain. As I'm writing this, it's just 1,24€ here (on -75% daily deal). The reason to get it is the fantastic water physics implemented that I haven't seen done so well in any other game. You'll enjoy the really natural look of the water filling the sinking ship you're in. It rises, it has currents, waves, very naturally flows out of flooded rooms as you open the door, releasing the water... The surface ripples according to all water movement and reflects the light beautifully. However... this game is very short. And the action aspects (shooting, that is) aren't done so well. The weapons are kinda lame and it generally feels pretty static compared to typical action games. I consider this game a demonstration of the impressive water engine and it's a shame they didn't put as much work on other things. But try it out!			",754,315,16,92,65,9,123

												Bought this while it was on sale for $3.00, let me tell you, THAT WAS A COMPLETE STEAL!  The water physics are amazingly good (better than you will see in any other game for 2011), and even though the plot is small and more or less easy to understand what happened during the events (not so much of the character back story), it's still a good game.  In a small nut shell:Pros:Good (but small) plot.Water physics are amazing.Has an okay cover and fire system.Cons:The camera is a little buggy, but you not to the point that it's unplayable.Depth of Field is going to take a minute or 2 too get used to but again, not a major issue.Expect to die a few times because you are up against AI with Shotguns and ARs while you only have a pistol (with different ammo types but you will mostly be using stun like ammo.) and your health is a joke.I know there are more cons then Pros, but its really a good game.

												Great game, but crappy ending.  It's a lot like Tomb Raider but with enough different to not be a clone.  The story is fun and the water and environmental hazards really keep you on your toes.  The end is CRAP! I was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when I saw it.  Not a spoiler in reality since most games have bosses etc.  It's your first and only boss fight and when you win, the game is over.  You're still trapped in a sinking city/ship, you just got cool powers and BOOM, the end.  Lame.  I do recommend it for the overall play, but don't expect any form of an ending that will make you happy.			",74,4,0,19,2,0,9

												Short game, takes about 3-4 hours. The story is a bit simple, and it ends rather abruptly. But it's an ok game. The water physics are pretty good, and the combat is ok as well. Besides swimming, you search for items, climb around, hack systems and kill enemies. It's not a bad game by any means, but it's just too short. Not worth the €10. If you can get it for €5 or less give it a go.[Rating: 76/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												I am glad I got this game for less than $1 because this game is a very big dissapointment the controls the story everything. Overall I liked the game and thought it was pretty cool but the camera is janky as f**k. Once you finally got the water powers you only had them for 1/8 of the game at the end. *spoiler* After you kill the ""boss"" you stab yourself with a the ""cure"" I am guessing then the credits begin... she doesn't even escape the sinking ship. After I quit the game in dissapointment and came back my save file was not their so I couldn't even try the challenge room. This game had a lot of potential with the water powers and all but it fell flat on its a$$ and never got back up.			",67,11,1,3,20,0,5

												Not entirely sure why there are so many mixed reviews for this game. Sure Hydrophobia isn't the greatest game out there. The visuals aren't incredible, by any means. The audio is ""meh"" at best. I saw someone mention that the water physics were good. They've CLEARLY NEVER actually seen water before(you will open doors & see a 3 ft wall of water that will take about 30 seconds to level out). But there is a fairly good story here. The setting is pretty good. The mechanics are above average. And the price is to what an ""ok"" game should be set at.			",820,186,6,73,31,7,49

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy is not a great game. I'd say it struggles to reach ""Good"" game, but it's an ""okay"" game. And at $0.49 a pop (until May 19,) it's a good deal, even if you're likely to get less than five hours out of it. You'd pay more for a trumped-up Flash game for your phone.			",138,25,0,27,21,0,34

												Pretty much tech demo sold as a game. Only good thing I can say about it is that water does look pretty awesome.  That said everything else looks bad and is boring ESPECIALLY main character (picture below). It's also really really short. Launcher also has some issues so I couldn't even start the game when I had Windows 7 (with 8.1 it magically started working) and devs have gone bankrupt already. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Teknologiademo jota myydään kokonaisena pelinä. Ainoa hyvä asia mitä pelistä voi sanoa on että vesi näyttää oikeasi hyvältä. Sitten kaikki muu näyttääkin aika ♥♥♥♥♥lta ja tylsältä VARSINKIN päähahmo (kuva alhaalla). Peli on myös aika helvetin lyhyt. Pelin launcherissa on jotain vikaa etten saanut edes peliä käyntiin Windows 7:lla (8.1:llä alkoi maagisesti toimia) ja kehittäjät on menneet konkkaan jo aikoja sitten.

												For less than $5, it's probably worth checking out. But don't expect it to be a solid shooter, because it's anything but. Pretty much every mechanic is this game feels clunky in one way or another, and even the water physics feel rather strange despite it being the main feature. Underwater combat can get pretty hectic as enemies can come from any direction, barrels and crap floating around more often than not, get in the way of combat. And oh, did I mention that the enemy uses bullet while you use a sonic gun which projectiles are larger and move slower? Also have a slower firing rate? You do get some sort of superpower towards the end, but it's not so super, and well... Rather disappointing.That said, the water mechanics are interesting to look at and is rather unique. Grab it during a sale if you can though.			",561,127,10,77,30,5,96

												This is a fun game.   It isn't a great game.    But if you go in knowing what to expect and without having exaggerated expectations,   it is fun.    It has cheesy writing at times,   it has bad enemy AI,   and it has a mediocre story.But,   it does have rather fun gameplay,   a decent amount of Tomb Raider-esque exploration,   plenty of time spent splashing around in that water that we gamers oh so love,  and some of the best water physics seen in any game to date.    It is also worth at least two play throughs.However,   due to my ""$1 per hour having fun"" rule for games,   I can't recommend this game at full price,   even at the low price tag of $12USD.    If you're quick,  it can be completed twice in as quickly as 6 hours.    But next time this game goes on sale,   it is definitely worth picking up.			",371,65,6,59,15,4,65

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy. What I think of it.Warning! Long review is long. You have been warned.-Default Gameplay Mechanics: 7/10 The default buttons are a bit annoying, but they can be remapped. Way points are misleading and don't help when you're stuck.There are things you have to look at very closely to be able to progress. The cover system sometimes doesn't wanna work so the character doesn't go for cover. Diving underwater sometimes happened randomly when I didn't want to dive. Health regen system, which is common in many games, makes an appearance in this one. The boss sometimes glitched out (see Boss Difficulty below).-Resolution: 10/10 Many resolutions to pick from. I was able to play it with my laptop connected to my big screen TV via HDMI on full screen.-Maximum Overall Graphics: 10/10 Hands down, the best water graphics I've ever seen. Ending cutscene had the worst graphics in the entire game. Water graphics could easily make up for it.NOTE: The game is all about the water.-Storyline: 6/10 (SPOILERS)A metropolis floating on water is attacked by a terrorist group known as Neo Malthusians. You, the character, are trapped and the area you are in is flooding. With the guidance from your buddy working the security cameras, you find a way to **escape**.It was good for the first 2 acts then suddenly became wtf on the second half of act 3. And it only has 3 acts. The game can be beaten in less than 4 hours if you know what to do. My first playthrough was 4 hours. And that's not beating it 100%.**It has a horrible ending with no resolution of any kind whatsoever. After beating the boss practically nothing happens**-Normal Enemy Difficulty on Easy: 9/10 The enemies were pretty easy. They did get some cheap hits every now and then. It's hard to tell if an enemy is dead or down from a certain distance.-Boss Difficulty: 6/10The last and only boss is ludicrously powerful. A woman (who can be assumed as the terrorist leader) takes control of a machine that has a mini-gun, rocket-type projectiles, and grenade launcher. It sometimes glitched out to the point where I had to restart the battle almost 10 times. When it tossed out bombs, it covered a large portion of the room and they're very hard to see so I didn't know where was considered safe. Getting cornered for one second is almost guaranteed death unless you're lucky to survive.Price: $4.99A bit high price for a short game. I got it when it was on special for $0.49, so I don't really regret it.-Overall: 6.5/10 - Pretty much the MetaScore (for once I agree with it)I liked the game. The majority of the storyline is good and it's not too long to beat. But, it had some painfully obvious problems (everything mentioned above). If the developer/publisher company didn't go bankrupt a couple of years ago, they could have made this game so much better.I'd recommend it, but honestly, you'd be better off buying it on sale for $0.49 than the regular $5 price.

												Probably one of the only games to have such a majority of underwater combat. This was a really fun game, though pretty short. The water simulation was as real as they advertise, and controlling the water later in the game is a definitely good feeling. Sure it takes about half the game to get the water powers, but it reminds me of KotOR; you spend most of your time on Taris as a non-Jedi, but getting those Jedi powers makes it oh so worth it. Also, while dying numerous times, I experienced no glitches.Srsly. On sale for $0.50, you can't go wrong. I only wish they'd make a sequel...or give it Steam Workshop support.			",90,5,0,8,9,2,8

												Hydrophobia's got novel gameplay and setting, and some seriously impressive water (I spent a lot of time staring at it through the wireframe scanner... the tech is beautiful). Water (and fear of water) are used very well to implement some unique and fun gameplay. Cool hacking and a smooth introduction of new gameplay throughout the game keep it interesting, and the story is promising, as well.Unfortunately this game's clearly rushed near the end, with a large amount of story elements and gameplay mechanics presented to the player all at once. This was originally going to be an episodic release and never saw any sequels. The game still reaches an ending that's fairly satisfying, despite that.The survival mode you unlock by winning at least serves as a fun way to explore the cool new moves they introduce at the end.

												Totally worth it, even if just to play with some really cool water physics, but it also happens that the game is actually fun, looks nice, and has some interesting philosophy and story elements. The only thing to be careful of is that it might not run well depending on your system. If there's one setting you not sacrifice I would recommend water effects, since that's really what Hydrophobia is all about.

												Despite the reviews that have averaged around 64/100, the game itself must be looked at not for its longevity or story.. It needs to be looked at for it's signature greatness: Realistic water physics! Seriously, for a indie title like this that was created by a handful of developers, it is very very hard to imagine why the hell many AAA title game developers with a extremely high budget can't pump out the same, if not better of a water-physics game! So simply put, if you don't understand what makes this so unique, here it is:The water is very dynamic, and uses Cosine trig functions as a basis for the water's modelling. The water uses many properties from real physics: Room 1 has lower water level, Room 2 has higher water level.. Door opens between the rooms, and Room 2's water flows into Room 1's water until it evens out.Even more exciting: When water flows into a room, waves will come through, pushing your player away, and the water smacks up against a wall them moves in the opposite direction. The water in this game can be manipulated too. If you shoot a glass window with a room full of water, the window will burst and in comes the massive amounts of water. The game is just pure awesome JUST because of the great water physics modelling. Everything else about this game is mediocre, and I can't justify paying full price ($15.00) for this game. I got it on sale and could justify the sale of ($7.00) or lower. ",233,20,5,27,18,1,53

												I got it because it was cheap. Controls feel clunky, I think there's a storyline in there somewhere although I couldn't understand A: What that story line was, B: If I should even care and 7: If I'm going to make the effort to care could ALL of the characters be a little less annoying.Probably not.It's got some nice water effects but even so they feel like they're not quite there. Nice waves but surely with that much water coming in the levels should rise more right? And what about undercurrents? If you're going to make a physics engine, and this game feels like a water physics engine with a hashed on game, then at least add those little extras.For the 50 odd p I payed for it it's not the worst way to kill a couple of hours but I'm not going to say you should get this if say a chocolate bar will last you the same amount of time.

												I've played not even an hour of this game (mainly because I just bought it today and I had to reinstall Steam because another game caused my Steam to not display on my desktop at all... but that's not the point) and I love it... somewhat. The graphics aren't the best for a game that came out in 2011 and the gameplay isn't the most innovative but for $0.49 USD (currently on sale [REGULAR PRICE: $4.99]).Imagine that this game came out earlier this year. You can't even get a Hershey Bar at that price but you can get (from what I've played so far) a futuristic Tomb Raider-esqe single player experience with flawless controls and an interesting story.Hydrophobia: Prophecy may be fairly short but for the low price it's more that well worth picking up, espectally if you're a fan of the Action/Adventure genre.

												Best 1.99 I ever spent.  Decent 3rd-person shooter/platformer that gets by with its unique setting and stunning water effects.  Even years after Hydrophobia's release, its water effects remain unsurpassed.  It flows, splashes, and roars around you while fire and sparks reflect beautifully and convincingly on its surface.  Top notch lighting design and effects also set the mood.   You play an engineer stuck on a giant, sinking, futuristic cruise ship fighting off doomsday terrorists.  The story gives the designers an excuse to stage claustrophic, tense, water logged scenarios reminiscent of the Sega classic Burning Rangers or the film Deep Rising.  It's an uncommon setting in games (perhaps because water was difficult to pull off) and it helps make Hydrophobia stand out from the pack.   The game's low budget origins are apparent-- the characters models are weak and the ending is very abrupt -- but so is its ambition.  Recommended.			",257,48,9,16,17,1,11

												Hydrophobia can be interesting or flat out boring, depending on whether you let flaws get in the way or not. Like most people, I have gotten this game in a bundle on Bundle Stars.Graphics: Decent. Though they appear ""shiny"" and can make it rather difficult to play, they aren't horrible and can be much worse. Like many other people have pointed out and a big part of the game, the water details are stunning even when set on the lowest texture setting.Gameplay: When it comes to rating a game I try to stay positive, but let's be real now. The controls are god awful. There are plenty of alternatives the developers could have used to make the controls simple and easy to learn. Instead, I have to smash my keyboard to get off from cornering the wall. The story line isn't too bad, but is overly cheesy.Sound Effects and voice acting: Sound effects are neat-o. The voice acting isn't too great but at least they were putting in an attempt. Believe me when I say I have heard MUCH worse.Overall Score: 3/5. It's better than what most people make it as, but isn't THAT great. It's entertaining to play if you have nothing else to do, but not worth the asking price. Wait for it to go on sale or get it in a bundle.			",79,20,1,9,10,2,3

												This game plays a lot like if Tomb Raider were made by an indie developer, except replace Lara Croft with the whiniest protagonist since my gigapet who I refused to feed in 4th grade. Seriously, the real hero in the story is Scoot for having to put up with it.That being said, it's a lot of fun. I'm not far along in the game, but it's got some epic moments only minutes into gameplay. Outrunning the waves of water that plow into the rooms and explode out the walls is extremely impressive and very cool.The story is very great as well for as much as I've played. Basically you're on a ship (I think?) that's being taken over by a terrorist group/cult and sunk into the ocean. You play as Kate, who I'm assuming was like a Cruise assistant lady or something...I don't know, and I don't care. This game has done me a huge favor in sparing me the dumb details and giving me a simple, kill the terrorist, escape the ship, and don't drown experience. Also everytime she says ""Jesus,"" in a bad situation, it sounds like she is literally addressing the Son of God. You'll hear it everytime now too. Enjoy!			",298,57,3,34,10,1,28

												Game shows some promise, especially for under $1usd... It can be a bit clunky at times (get used to using controllers, because many games now are set up for controller first and it just makes things easier), the premise was kind of neat.... But it looks like it is only part of a whole and WAS going to be an episodic release type game so you will finish it rather quickly and wonder where it was supposed to go from there. I like the water and swimming mechanic and the shooting isn't bad either... Just extremely short and missing an overall reach. But was definately a buck or more worth of entertainment.

												At USD$0.37, you can't go wrong with Hydrophobia. It's your standard 3rd person shooter on a sinking ocean liner. If you are in the mood for janky shooting mechanics, controls, ai and animations then you're in the right place. The graphics and water physics on the other hand are quite impressive. I'd give it an A+ for ambition and C- for execution. Just like their previous games(Rise of the Robots & Theatre of Pain) it's all style over substance.Recommended if you can get it below USD$0.50			",84,12,1,6,2,1,7

												The game despite being short and quite repetative is worth playing. Why? First let me tell you what is wrong with the game (there is quite a lot!)Cons:-Character handles poorly, especially in 3 deminsional environments.-Story lacking explaination and execution.-Character develpoment: Non Existant.-Missions very repetative.-Platforming not imaginative (in most cases).-Enemies are not very difficult to defeat.-Voice acting is quite bad.-Lip syncing is awful.-Repeated models (for example in one scene two identical men, are lined up and exacuted)...Now you are probably thinking, 'What is the point of playing this game then?'The most standout feature of this game is the level of exploration. At times the game reminds me of the film Posidon Adventure. The game is very good at making the player second guess themselves, and ask questions. Now while this level of exploration is not consistant, for the parts that it is in makes this game highly enjoyable.This game for me personally is a showcase (eventhough to my knowlege it is not), a showcase of the possibilities for games made by larger companies. For example if bioshock or bioshock 2 implmeted the water system that this game uses it could have been probably one of the best games of the decade (it still is very good).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is actually a pretty damn enjoyable game (especially at the DAFT-CHEAP price of 40pence(!) when on sale)The Movement / Cover and Weapon usage is passable to Good...Sadly, the story / acting both pretty poor.butMany of the other mechanics here are Decent and FULL of Potential (this was originally planned as a D/L trilogy but only part 1 was ever released)The climbing/Bal;ancing/swimming etc all work nicely together, but the Best Bits of all - and something that happens in No other game- is the water mechanic where the water has real weight and heft. You are on a gigantic sinking ship and, say, you're in a corridor, and a sealed room next to you is full of sea-water, you can shoot out the window and it'll come pounding into the corridor washing everything (and you / Bad Guys) away Very Realistically.You can Electrify the Water/Put out Fires, and so on, Escape as Ocean slowly fills a whole ships levels up with swirling,pushing Ocean, with you desperately trying to get out before it gets to the ceiling and you have no breath left etc. All this Dynamic is unique in gaming and solidly Exciting to enact.(the main character, 'Kate' I think, had a childhood accident in a small Dinghy that killed a Family member, so now she is terrified of Water/Drowning: (Hence the ""HydroPhobia"" of the title) and she begins to freak out when water gets over her head). The potential for this Tech is just boggling...(if they were ever return to Rapture say, for the final time - With the whole place coming apart,piece by piece, Then this Water Tech would be Incredible to use.Also it was only like a 7 Person team who made this, so not entirely fair to judge by AAA standards - Personally, I think it stands up fairly well, and could have gone on to do Great things ( as you get some kinda 'Water-Controlling' Tech, later in the Game - And use it to overcome the Bads /Solve puzzles Etc which is utterly unique idea ) . Damn Shame.Microsoft bought the Engine in 2010ish but haven't done a thing with it since then - Even a new ""Silent Hunter"" Sub-Sim, with huge rolling waves at Sea would be Super-Good, I hope they DO do Something with it (or Give it to the MODders to use)WELL WORTH THE PRICE - I personally enjoyed the Game; and was awestruck by the potential of the Tech seen here  7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even at $3 this game is overpriced. It looks, feels and sounds like some interns made it and voice acted it. The gameplay is like a poor man's Assassins Creed, only with terrible controls and plot, with a linear path. They try and add a sense of urgency by adding timed missions, all of which can be completed with over half of the time left on the clock. Be weary of a game which goes on sale for 75% off this close to the launch date. Also, the main protagonist is an annoying girl who does nothing but complain about her situation the entire time. So if you want to play a game that complains that you're playing it, while simultaniously being no fun to begin with, then buy this game. If you aren't into playing crap for the sake of playing crap, then save the $3 and buy a sandwhich.			",569,115,25,61,31,6,84

												This is not exactly a recomendation... I enjoyed this game at the price I got it (like $3) But I don't understand what happened at the end.I loved the water physics, it was really imersive when a riptide of water cames in through a bulkhead and knocks everyone off their feet. Underwater combat is a joke, everyone can breathe underwater but you, guns are ineffective unless you're the main character using the infinite charge gun, and everyone always knows where you are.Unfortunately, by the time you get the promised water manipulation powers the game is already over. Seriously! You get the water powers about fifteen minutes before the end of the game. The final boss is a joke, a big robot that you attack twice. TWICE! And then the big baddie gets electorcuted and you get rid of your super powers with the antidote. Lame.My guess is that they ran out of funds, and had to cobble together the finally just as things were getting interesting.So much potential!			",372,90,5,59,83,2,77

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy has gotten a lot of negative press, both for the quality of the game and for the outlandish PR department. Although tempting, it's important to not attribute negative qualities of people to the work they create.That being said, Hydrophobia isn't a very good game. At it's best it oddly reminds me of Beyond Good and Evil. At it's very worst it redefines a new low. The controls are terri-bad (I've never experienced worse controls then the underwater sections.) The optomization is awful, there are constant FPS drops and  an overall low performance. While the graphics are nice, the animations are horrendous. That is, minus the water physics: hands down the best water effects I've ever seen. The story is interesting, if not presented very awkwardly. It's obvious that effort was put into it. The game isn't very long; it took me a little under three hours to complete, not stopping to explore.			",359,97,3,57,18,4,44

If you can handle the terrible controls and mediocre combat then you're in for a treat. Especially the water.THE WATER.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the beginning I was really enjoying Hydrophobia.  It had a nice post apocalyptic/dystopian feel about it, and lets be honest, the water effects are increadible.  But water doesn't make necessarily make a compelling world - just ask Kevin Costner.  The narative is pretty much 'by the book' stuff, even down to the heard but not seen accomplice who helps you as you begin your escape, right up until he decides to bail and leaves you on your own, but that's not an issue as you're quite self sufficient.  There are a few tricky puzzles, and choosing which ammunition to use during combat can certainly make these things easier or harder as you go along.  There are destrucible parts of the environment (power cables) that you can use to make your life easier - and we all know what happens when electricity hits water...  But all this enjoyment came to an abrupt end with the final battle.  It's cheap, it's annoying, it's frustrating but most of all, it let the story down.  I could have forgiven that battle if it actually tied into the narative, but it feels cheap and tacked on which is a real pity.  I will recommend this game, as I did enjoy it overall, but it did leave a bad taste right at the end.			",56,8,2,12,0,1,7

												The biggest thing I can say about Hydrophobia is that it's damn short. At under three hours, it's one of the shortest commercial releases I know of. It's a third-person shooter with a bit of Uncharted-style climbing, a hacking minigame, and a surprise gameplay twist near the end I won't spoil here, simply because it comes literally out of nowhere. I bought the game about three years ago and never touched it before today, but it proved a satisfying diversion. Hydrophobia is most notable for its water physics- player character Kate Wilson, a systems engineer, is aboard a massive oceangoing vessel in the midst of a terrorist attack, and nearly every area is at least partially flooded. This can be used to the player's advantage, triggering bulkhead breaches to toss enemies about in addition to the more genre-standard exploding barrels and exposed electrical currents. The swimming controls are competent and you have a generous oxygen meter, although the camera can be disorienting. Uniquely, you can grab objects such as crates while underwater and use them as portable cover. You have only one gun, a pistol, but it can be used with five different ammuntion types, including remote-trigger grenades. Hydrophobia succeeds better as an entire game about water levels then most games do in a single segment, and on that merit alone I can recommend it. It seems this title was  the first episode of a series, but the developer has since closed without further episodes being made and this title ends on an extremely abrupt cliffhanger. If that doesn't bother you however, Hydrophobia will make for an enjoyable afternoon.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												I liked this game more than I disliked it, that is why I clicked ""yes recommend"" this game.  The reality is this game is, for me, very average and disappointing in many ways.My biggest complaint about this game is that it was short.  Like really really short.  It has 3 stages and then it ends, though the stages are fairly long it doesn't really help the matter.  Stemming from that, the story for this game was very ill-handled, by which I mean it wasn't handled.  You get a bit of backstory about how the world basically turned into a new, uninhabitable Pangea, with one giant ocean that a giant city on a boat sails on with all the sane/not criminal members of humanity, and there's a terrorist cell that lives/was exiled to the dried up husk of a continent who think humanity is ruining/ruined the world and needs to die.  There's a lot that they could have done with this to flesh the story out and be something unique or unique-ish, but the story is basically in the background the whole game.  The worst part of this complaint focuses on the main character: an engineer on the ship named Kate Wilson who it is implied by the title has hydrophobia.  This would be a really interesting twist considering how much of the game revolves around water in different gameplay elements (haha, pun) but the only times it really comes up or affects anything is in the beginning when her coworker tells her she can do this, and when she stays underwater for awhile you hear a little girl laughing, which hints at why she has hydrophobia, but it's never explained or explored, and otherwise she might as well not have it at all.The only other complaint I have concerns the water-manipulating aspect of the game, which you don't ""unlock"" until the 3rd stage, and when you do all you do is raise water into a pillar to splash something or raise something in the water up into the air to touch something for some reason or another.  I can get why they would start out with only this because she's new to this ability, and if the game were longer maybe they would develop that further so she learns how to use water differently, but sadly the game ends before it can get to that point.  At least we got to see the cool-looking glowing effect on her arm for a little bit.I lied earlier, I have one other complaint that I would have tried to go back and integrate into the first complaint paragraph but I don't feel like putting in that kind of effort right now.  The ending itself is really disappointing.  You (spoilers!) kill the terrorist leader and kill the nanites that are giving you water-bending powers from eating your insides out, then basically pass out of relief and the credits role.  No thought is given about the giant ocean-liner with a city that has hundreds of people living on it that's sinking into the ocean, and I guess the rest of the terrorists that were stealing more of those deadly nanites gave up when some psychic call went out about their leader dying.The gameplay was pretty fun, reminded me of Tomb Raider like it reminded everyone else of Tomb Raider.  The graphics looked good, nothing fancy but was nice to look at.  And of course the water physics were exellent.  I may have been slightly drunk while writing this.  I'm sorry.			",134,18,1,8,11,1,6

Controls were spot on except for a lack of ledge-hang button.  I craved the cover controls from Deus Ex Human Revolution (as the mechanics in this game are a little like that).Actual game stuff -- Many ammo types but only a few useful ones (default and EMP for the bossfight).  Combat was fine enough but enemies seemed to spawn out of corners or nooks a few times.  Platforming worked well.  Water powers difficult to control   The water mechanics worked well, but I wished the water pushed me around more, it doesn't quite feel real.The storyline is good, characters good, gameplay good... just NOT enough of it!  I finished this game in only a few hours, just a bit more than 3.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												I didn't enjoy this game as much as I hoped I would. The whole water gimmick was cool at first, but eventually just became annoying.Graphics: The water graphics, for the most part, look decent. The graphics design is pretty cool, although I'm a sucker for the whole cyberpunk futuristic look. Other than that it's nothing too special.Story: The voice acting is pretty bad, which makes it hard to care about the characters. The story itself is relatively straightforward and cliched, and is a whopping 3 hours long, so that is definitely not a selling point of this game. The writing is uninspired, although there was one line that made me laugh: ""I've got two balls and neither one is crystal.""Gameplay: The gimmick of this game is the use of large amounts of water to your advantage, whether it be to access high areas, put out fires, or sweep enemies off of their feet. That feature itself was pretty well done, but it was not utilized very often, and when it was, it was laid out step by step. There was absolutely no intuition required, which made the mechanic pretty boring. Other than that, the cover system is frustratingly bad, the gunplay is unsatisfying, and the controls are stiff.Overall, don't spend your time or money with this game, unless you're a...uh...water fanatic? It's really nothing special and I found myself frustrated more often than entertained. 3/10			",296,67,5,19,14,2,17

												So I just beat it and it only took 3 hours. So you can't really complain too much since it only costs $5 and I got it on sale but there really isn't much to it. The water graphics might have been nice when they first were released but not so much now. Also, the game just ends abruptly. I didn't even know it was over until the credits just started running and the final boss is incredibly easy and I think it glitched because it just started blowing up for no reason. Anyway, only buy for some easy achievements but no more than $3.			",177,37,0,10,4,1,10

												This game is about tons of water, but its controls are anything but fluid. Aside from that, if you want good voice acting, an intriguing story, smart AI, or a 10+ hour experience, GO FIND ANOTHER GAME.But what the game does have going for it is that it is a nicely packaged adventure for a bargain price (on sale it's a matter of cents) and is still pretty fun.5.5/10 ",41,4,0,6,5,0,3

It's not very good. 4/10.It's Unfinished: It feels like a demo you have to pay for. The game time I have is the entire game, minus the challenge room (about ~30 extra minutes).Terrible Voiceacting: Grating, low-quality, and the script was probably written by a 16 year old with a Tumblr blog.Impressive Physics: It feels like the entire budget went into the water physics, since it's the best thing about this game! It's a very unique trait in a video game.Awful Campaign: The story explains literally nothing, and ends as if you beat a demo for a full game. If anything, this was just to test the physics engine they used for the water.No Content: It's just a collectathon with only a handful of mediocre achievements and nothing to explore. It's a very minimal and boring game.Additional Notes and CommentaryI can't repeat it enough, but this literally is just a demo to me. The campaign is incredibly short, and ends abruptly like you just finished the first chapter of a really long campaign; except you kill the only main antagonist in the story.The only reason it got any score is because the physics engine used for the water was impressive and fun to mess around with. You could flood hallways and entire rooms by shooting weak walls or shattering windows, or even just opening doors! Then you could shoot explosive barrels to make all sorts of crazy physics happen. This was literally the only good thing in the game to me.Would I recommend this game at all? Absolutely not. I bought it for about $2 and think it shouldn't be worth anything at all. The story was terrible, the voiceacting was probably the worst thing about the game, and it made me skip every cutscene in the game, because it was nothing but a guy over a comm making sex jokes at the female protagonist.

												6/10 Marginal thumbs up. Got this for $1.24, so I wasn't expecting much. I played through in 5 hours but you could easily do it in 3, so not much content. Completing the game opens up a challenge room, but I had no desire to continue. The premise had a lot of potential, but the story is corny. (""Neo-Malthusians""? Really?) Voice acting is fairly lousy, especially the main character, Kate Wilson. Not much variety in combat or level design. Lara Croft-style climbing and ledge jumping were a plus. But the water physics are amazing and save the game from the scrap pile. The puzzles involving water keep the game interesting enough. You get a really cool superpower late in the game, but too late to be very satisfying.			",105,12,3,12,10,0,8

												I originally had this game on a console and loved it so much that when I sold the console I was thrilled it was available on the PC. From what I've played so far everything appears to be the same and as much fun as the console version. The only thing that I don't like about the PC game is some of the voice acting has changed. Other than that I would say that this game is a great deal at its normal price. If you get it during a sale then you got an even better deal.			",513,197,6,47,39,4,55

Seriously, it's £ 0.39 at the moment, and I'd probably still want my money back (think I paid about a pound or so, but in the sense that any money spent on it is wasted, I don't really care that I could have paid less). Maybe there's some entertainment value in the bad accents, but one the cutscene's over and you get to the actual gameplay, it's all downhill from there. Just say no.			",137,147,3,30,32,3,42

												I bought this game to test my new debit card for 0,49 euros back before refunds existed...I regret spending that money.This...is a very, very bad game. I wanted to beat the game for the sake of being able to give a review based on the complete game, but I just couldn't make myself finish it. In the hour and a half spent on the game, I finished around half the game judging by the collectibles and chapter select. It just isn't worth any more time.I am desperately trying to find something positive in this game. If I had to pick, I would say that for the time when this game came out, the water physics are pretty good. Other than that...First of all, apart from water, everything else looks bland and generic. Not only are the graphics bad, with human animations being some of the worst I've seen, but apart from fire and water, everything else is either grey, blue, yellow or red. During the time I spent with it, I never left generic sci-fi corridors which all look the same.There is a story, but the dialog and voice acting are so awful that I couldn't make myself listen to them. And even if I did, it is impossible to piece together what is going on. Somebody is attacking the station our protagonist lives on, for reasons I never understood, nor could get myself to care about. The characters are so bad and generic, there is some hint that the protagonist is special in some way but I didn't reach that point in the game, and I think that even if I did I wouldn't care.The pacing and gameplay are also very bad. In the time I played, I only had two enemy encounters, the rest was platforming and swimming. Not very challenging, and very boring with little to no challenge. There were a few puzzles, but those seem more like padding than actual gameplay mechanics. And the controls are terrible, often causing me to jump in a completely different direction from the one I wanted.All in all, don't buy this game, it isn't worth your time, nor your money.

												So my initial impressions of this game were that is was a fairly low budget production with some interesting ideas and good use of in game physics, particularly with regards to the water. Well worth a purchase in a sale for a 3-4 hour experience. However, that's when I got to Act 2 and the crashes began. The performance of this game divebombs after Act 1 on my system, with near constant framerate drops and frequent enough crashing to become intrusive, particularly prominent in an experience as short this. To add to this frustration, voice acting and subtitles began to desync and stutter the further into to game I progressed, the games conclusion is painfully lacking and the ""Challenge Room"" unlocked as post game content is quite frankly the worst and most shallow wave based horde mode I have ever experienced.I wanted to give this game a recommendation as at its best, it presents competent exploration and at the very least an average experience overall, but the simple facts of game instability and the bad taste left upon completion would make this dishonest.

												Hydrophobia, a cross between adventure and third person shooter. The game starts on a giant ship which houses tonnes of people. You play as a mechanical engineer who is trying to foil the terorist attack on the vessel.The game is relatively cheap at $5 (I got it for about $1 at sale :D). The main selling point of the game is the water mechanics. You can control the flow of water to open paths and even defeat enemies. The water graphics are really good (it looks and moves fluidly). Now for the bad points. Although the water graphics are good, other models (ie. characters, environment) seem somewhat bland. The voice acting isn't that great either, nor is the story unfortunately. The biggest problem I had with the game were lag spikes. Alot of lag spikes. Although it's a single player only game, it lagged and even freezes (for a few minutes at a time) on me in several areas even after lowering all the graphical settings to bottom. I play games like retribution and crysis  fine with minimum lag, but this game struggles to run for some reason. The third person shooting is also clunky as the movement controls aren't great.Overall, the game does try to be unique with the water mechanics, but it doesn't make up the the under par graphics, story, controls and bugs. I haven't finished it (due to the bugs), but after spending 2 hours in it I'm not really compelled to play it. Save your money people.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

There are flames, explosions and water all over the place which sometimes make it difficult to see who is shooting you. The story is nice it gives you enough detail to know what is going on but leaves a number of unanswered questions which makes you think you are just scratching the surface. The downsides of this game are firstly the controls are quite awkward for certain parts of the game and secondly it is rather short.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												Hydrophobia in all its 3 hour long glory switches between dull 3rd person combat and frustrating climbing sections. Some neat water mechanics and effects (opening door to allow water to rush through, knocking enemies off their feet etc) but the game does nothing with them. Some of the most cringeworthy dialogue and voice acting I've ever seen. The controls are unforgivably bad and clunky, only slightly better with a controller.Only reccommended if you want to see the pretty impressive water effects and it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. Sadly not good triple monitor experience.You need a desktop graphics card to run this game, i mean its not exactly the most demanding thing out there but with the heavy water detail, yeah you need something better then you usual. Im sad, i have to play this game on 1080p. It looks nice on triple hd, but it has some severe problems with the interface. Also take to note that thsi game is pretty old, they probably weren't thinking about 3k or triple hd. The game runs fine, it looks nice enough has a decent story, its just for that small crowd, that does the triple monitor or 4k be aware. Otherwise its great!EDIT: Man i did some messing around, figured out some thing about how to ensure i can play as much as i can with triple monitors. I used to love this game. Its sad, the lack of support for such a awkward aspect ratio. I mean graphically they used an awesome engine, its looks great runs great. Just mechanically, its total trash. Imma have to remove surround and play with it as 1080p. Also i believe the story is saved to your steam account, so no matter what comp you log into, you still have yor process saved, which is amazing ofr this old of a game. 2011, not decades old, but not new non the less.

												Good game. Great graphics and great water simulation! It is a bit short, the final portion of the game feels a bit rushed, but it is still worth playing.There are some issues:- Windowed mode requires a launch parameter.- Sometimes, upon game launch, the saved progress will not be loaded (""Load Game"" will be disabled). Just exit and launch the game again until the progress gets loaded correctly.- Some in-game medals are glitchy, requiring restarting the entire playthrough, or even wiping the entire progress. Getting 100% achievements in this game is too annoying, repetitive and time-consuming.			",612,229,21,38,55,9,66

												The water is cool I will give them that but the FPS on this game is Sh$@. I don't know what the fps actually is but it dosnt seem like 60 and at times is like under 30 I think (yes my PC should be able to play this well past 60) It drops in places and dosnt run well in general which is fine if you have a high end pc but be warned. It loses save files which is sad because I'm not going to go back and redo somthing that I didnt enjoy that much in the first place. I dont think the game is bad to say but its not very clear on what to do or where to go. Theres lots of platforming stuff I don't think fits the game. I don't want to uber biased because I lost my save file. ( not sure how it got lost in the cloud I don't think it uplodes right honestly. I have come across countless buggs. The first cutscene is where it goes to $@#$. I don't usally write bad reviews but Ive tryed this on a few dif computers and the buggs and framerate is the same even when testing it on a old computer. Theres not much positive to say honestly :( I can't recommend this at full price but for what I payed which was like 40 cents sure why not.			",238,75,0,64,14,2,26

												So my initial impressions of this game were that is was a fairly low budget production with some interesting ideas and good use of in game physics, particularly with regards to the water. Well worth a purchase in a sale for a 3-4 hour experience. However, that's when I got to Act 2 and the crashes began. The performance of this game divebombs after Act 1 on my system, with near constant framerate drops and frequent enough crashing to become intrusive, particularly prominent in an experience as short this. To add to this frustration, voice acting and subtitles began to desync and stutter the further into to game I progressed, the games conclusion is painfully lacking and the ""Challenge Room"" unlocked as post game content is quite frankly the worst and most shallow wave based horde mode I have ever experienced.I wanted to give this game a recommendation as at its best, it presents competent exploration and at the very least an average experience overall, but the simple facts of game instability and the bad taste left upon completion would make this dishonest.

Though controls are a bit hard to remember on keyboard (they do remind you which keys are used for what on many times though) and the X360/PC controller worked poorly at first then didn't work at all for some obscure reason.

												     Hydrophobia: Prophecy is an interesting concept that fails too deliver on serveral fronts. The story revolves around Kate Wilson a security agent on a massive ship named ""Queen of the World"". The homeworld (presumably Earth) lacks resources too sustain human populations; a lucky few live in luxury on the Queen of the World out in the ocean. The cruiser is attacked by a terrorist oragnization known as the Malthusians, a not so clever reference too economist Thomas Malthus. It is up to Kate and what is left of the security forces too navigate and salvage the sinking ship.     Where Hydrophobia fails is in exectution. The game is near impossible too play with a keyboard and is very difficult too use a controller as well. The puzzles are relatively easy, as the game itself always points you in the right direction. The voice acting is absolutely atrocious. The voice actors have no emotion in reading a poor script, which eventually grates on the players ears. Nobody talks like they do in Hydrophobia, in some circumstances it was humorous, but overall really detracted from the overall game. Terribly adapted Japanese animes have better lines then this game. The more I found myself playing the game the more I wanted too turn it off. The pretty water and occasional shootouts do not salvage this game. I can only recommend purchasing this game if it is on sale with a huge discount. Even then you are not missing out. -Alex			",76,7,0,11,5,1,10

												A really fun game with the best water physics and any game. EVER. The gameplay is fun and the water adds a whole new dynamic to the gameplay.If an enemy is shooting at you you can do various things such as using a sonic round to send a wave at him or shooting some of the environmental items like damaged walls to flood the room or electrical panels to electrocute the enemy.I highly recommend it, at the moment it has a few performance issues but those are being ironed out by the patches.

												Great game. Water Physics pay for the game itself, I spent a lot of my time just seeing how big a wave I could make opening a door or trying to find places I can destory to flood the whole room.The main character isnt exaggerated. When terrorists bombard her work, she doesnt grow a beard, put a cigar in her mouth and go to town with machine guns and bombs spounting cheezy one liners like..""DROWN IN HELL!""Your friend Scoot is a cool dude and I enjoyed his antics.Hacking, although it was cake, I thought was nice new approach and it never seemed like a waste of time.The first gun is your best gun, it overshadows everything else. I dont think the point was to just shoot people though, they added so many things you can break and blowup to kill enemies with it really doesnt matter what gun you use.Lastly, I wouldnt buy into the hate, this game is as good as any other game out there and I found the expirence to be a steal compared to its price.

												This game had quite a bit of potential going for it, all of which falls flat on its face by the end. The controls are clunky fit awkwardly with the sudden changes in camera behavior, especially when entering water. Enemies will appear seemingly at random around you, including behind you and from locations you were just in. Graphical glitches crop up frequently, including ones where the floor and wall textures fail to load. The design flaws are numerous, including one noteable example of being knocked to my death in a forced animation by a scripted sequence where terrain collapses as the character is climbing up some debris.The level design is poor, not utilizing any external environments at all which could have aided in both the game's quality and length  as it's set on a giant boat yet at no point do you go outside and are instead relgated to wandering a series of corridors within the ship's bowels. Also, this game is very short, only a few hours of play at best.Buy only under $5.			",381,117,3,68,29,4,47

												Hydrophobia can be interesting or flat out boring, depending on whether you let flaws get in the way or not. Like most people, I have gotten this game in a bundle on Bundle Stars.Graphics: Decent. Though they appear ""shiny"" and can make it rather difficult to play, they aren't horrible and can be much worse. Like many other people have pointed out and a big part of the game, the water details are stunning even when set on the lowest texture setting.Gameplay: When it comes to rating a game I try to stay positive, but let's be real now. The controls are god awful. There are plenty of alternatives the developers could have used to make the controls simple and easy to learn. Instead, I have to smash my keyboard to get off from cornering the wall. The story line isn't too bad, but is overly cheesy.Sound Effects and voice acting: Sound effects are neat-o. The voice acting isn't too great but at least they were putting in an attempt. Believe me when I say I have heard MUCH worse.Overall Score: 3/5. It's better than what most people make it as, but isn't THAT great. It's entertaining to play if you have nothing else to do, but not worth the asking price. Wait for it to go on sale or get it in a bundle.			",79,20,1,9,10,2,3

												The game despite being short and quite repetative is worth playing. Why? First let me tell you what is wrong with the game (there is quite a lot!)Cons:-Character handles poorly, especially in 3 deminsional environments.-Story lacking explaination and execution.-Character develpoment: Non Existant.-Missions very repetative.-Platforming not imaginative (in most cases).-Enemies are not very difficult to defeat.-Voice acting is quite bad.-Lip syncing is awful.-Repeated models (for example in one scene two identical men, are lined up and exacuted)...Now you are probably thinking, 'What is the point of playing this game then?'The most standout feature of this game is the level of exploration. At times the game reminds me of the film Posidon Adventure. The game is very good at making the player second guess themselves, and ask questions. Now while this level of exploration is not consistant, for the parts that it is in makes this game highly enjoyable.This game for me personally is a showcase (eventhough to my knowlege it is not), a showcase of the possibilities for games made by larger companies. For example if bioshock or bioshock 2 implmeted the water system that this game uses it could have been probably one of the best games of the decade (it still is very good).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But it looks like it is only part of a whole and WAS going to be an episodic release type game so you will finish it rather quickly and wonder where it was supposed to go from there.

												At USD$0.37, you can't go wrong with Hydrophobia. It's your standard 3rd person shooter on a sinking ocean liner. If you are in the mood for janky shooting mechanics, controls, ai and animations then you're in the right place. The graphics and water physics on the other hand are quite impressive. I'd give it an A+ for ambition and C- for execution.

												Completed the video game Hydrophobia today; my feelings towards the game are mixed, as was the case with many reviews around the gaming industry and with gamers. The dynamic water effects and the related ways that water plays a huge part in not only how you get around, but how you deal with situations and fight enemies, was very unique and in many ways worth experiencing for the avid gamer and those looking to see a new type of game mechanic. The water felt considerably realistic in movement.There are unfortunately many things to not like about the game.			",182,20,5,4,4,1,5

												This is actually a pretty damn enjoyable game (especially at the DAFT-CHEAP price of 40pence(!) when on sale)The Movement / Cover and Weapon usage is passable to Good...Sadly, the story / acting both pretty poor.butMany of the other mechanics here are Decent and FULL of Potential (this was originally planned as a D/L trilogy but only part 1 was ever released)The climbing/Bal;ancing/swimming etc all work nicely together, but the Best Bits of all - and something that happens in No other game- is the water mechanic where the water has real weight and heft. You are on a gigantic sinking ship and, say, you're in a corridor, and a sealed room next to you is full of sea-water, you can shoot out the window and it'll come pounding into the corridor washing everything (and you / Bad Guys) away Very Realistically.You can Electrify the Water/Put out Fires, and so on, Escape as Ocean slowly fills a whole ships levels up with swirling,pushing Ocean, with you desperately trying to get out before it gets to the ceiling and you have no breath left etc. All this Dynamic is unique in gaming and solidly Exciting to enact.(the main character, 'Kate' I think, had a childhood accident in a small Dinghy that killed a Family member, so now she is terrified of Water/Drowning: (Hence the ""HydroPhobia"" of the title) and she begins to freak out when water gets over her head). The potential for this Tech is just boggling...(if they were ever return to Rapture say, for the final time - With the whole place coming apart,piece by piece, Then this Water Tech would be Incredible to use.Also it was only like a 7 Person team who made this, so not entirely fair to judge by AAA standards - Personally, I think it stands up fairly well, and could have gone on to do Great things ( as you get some kinda 'Water-Controlling' Tech, later in the Game - And use it to overcome the Bads /Solve puzzles Etc which is utterly unique idea ) . Damn Shame.Microsoft bought the Engine in 2010ish but haven't done a thing with it since then - Even a new ""Silent Hunter"" Sub-Sim, with huge rolling waves at Sea would be Super-Good, I hope they DO do Something with it (or Give it to the MODders to use)WELL WORTH THE PRICE - I personally enjoyed the Game; and was awestruck by the potential of the Tech seen here  7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												probably doesn't deserve all the smack it got. probably. the character design is godawful, with a protagonist who cannot decide if she'd rather be gordon freeman or jade, but with the surprising novelty of not being a total badass and showing actual fear. the levels are very linear and not too original to say the least, but the whole water aspect is really well rendered. the combat will be too easy for hardcore gamers, but has an easy variety on offer, enemies coming in your choice of grilled, fried, poached, exploded or riddled with bullets. it is however shockingly short, and the story could have done with a lot more depth (or at least exposition). it could be bought on offer for the one mostly unsung aspect it gets absolutely right: no satan-inspired vehicle section.

												It is quite decent game. Will not knock your socks off but it has enough unique(ish) twists and gameplay to be worth it on this age of generic shooters. About 6 hours of campaign with little side exploration - as much as this is possible as game is relatively linear. A bit more character development would have been nice and few threads of the story were left hanging in the end (but then again it is possible that a follow up game was planned to deal with these somehow, dont know). That out of the way the main protagonist has at least some character and motivation in it. So in a nutshell decent game - quite worth it on sale and if you have nothing to play then might be even be fair trade at it's full price.			",215,55,0,67,45,0,94

												So, this game is very short, and the combat is sub-par, but it is still a good game to grab for the price.It is a very cool game, the water physics is very fun to mess around in, and it is very good. The combat could use some improvement, but overall it is alright. The main problem is the climbing. If you do not run Vsync, you are going to have a very bad time. If you don't believe me, try to compare. You have to run it with it, it makes the combat so smoother, and you cannot complete the game without it, so make sure to enable it. The other lacking part is the story. Bland, boring, and most of all, it doesn't have an ending. It has no closure, and it kinda just rolls to the credits, which is a shame, because it seems like a cool world. You are on a giant ship, and it starts to flood from a terrorist attack. That is pretty much all they say. You don't know why, you don't know the characters, you only really learn your name from the character talking to herself (Which I still don't know what it is.) But still, if you like Tomb Raider, you will probably enjoy this game.6.75/10			",5,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall: 7/10Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Story: 6/10I know this game gets a bad rap for being short and having a lacking story, but I found it easy to get into the story and keep up.  It's something you have to pay attention to.  I didn't find the story really all that boring, I'm just disappointed that you don't get your powers until late in the game when they're a bit irrelevant.  (I'm so used to shooting my guns that I don't know if I'll use the powers much.)  I also liked that the main focus, water, had life to it.  It wasn't just something that was everywhere and utterly useless, you could actually use it to progress in the game.  Need to go up one level but no stairs/ladder/etc?  Can't go through a door because there is a fire right in front of it?   Shoot a wall and ride the flood.   Need to get to the next part of the story and don't feel like killing your way through a group of 10 guys?  You guessed it, OPEN THE FLOOD GATES AND SHOOT DOWN SOME POWER LINES.  Too many indie developers go for generic, popular themes such as the ever popular Zombie shooter or some post-apocalyptic world that has little to no back story as to how things happened (or it takes forever to know the full story).  It's refreshing that they did their own spin on a futuristic dying Earth where the problem was over-population and not some catastrophic apocolyptic event.  For $5($0.49 during steam sales), this game gives you your money's worth and 8 times out of 10 you'll enjoy playing this for a few hours.  I got this through a Humble Bundle, so I didn't pay more than $0.10 for it, therefore take what I say with a grain of salt.			",94,18,0,19,17,0,9

												I honestly do not understand the reasons for such low scores on this game.For the time period, this was pretty neat graphically, and I am always happy to check out engine attempts.The water physics are really well done here, and even if the game feels a bit hollow at the core, it playes decent and I am having fun.Considering how cheap this gets on sale, WTH is wrong with people wanting to complain so much?What is this game like?  Kind of like a level based Resident Evil-ish stirred in with a bit of Budget Raideresque climbing and jumping.What do you get for your dollar or so on sale?  You get an average title that attempted to display some new ideas in an engine, a decent bit of playtime, and a story that isn't as bad as a good majority of games like it.Would I suggest a Buy?  He11 yeah I would!This is not the action game of the year, but it is a complete and working title that does exactly as I expected.If you want something that is not super pricey, and yet can still return on your dollar (literally less than a pouch of crisps).Buy it on sale if budget, or ""engine concept"" games interest you.Do not buy this if you want a $30+ polished supergame.

												Although to start with the default controls feel a bit akward once you tweak them and get used to them they become more intuitive. The water effects are second to none even going as far as the waves and water pressure affecting your movement, pushing you or pulling you around the map. combat is fairly simple, but be warned its no bulletstorm, you die fast if you get caught by suprise or in the open, and the environmental effects will fry you faster than a fluffy hamster on a gas bbq if you aren't paying attention. the story so far is pretty good, and overall the game is a lot of fun, challenging where it needs to be and rewarding to boot. and for £7 its a bargain.

There is some cover mechanics. Few kinds of ammo for your gun.Hacking minigame which does not suck or frustrate much.A lot of environmental damage sources, think barrels, electric panels you can blow up to electrocute people. Level design and graphics are quite nice.Production value is ok. It's over in 5 hours, but a lot cheaper than a movie ticket.I do recommend, but don't expect insane replayability value.

												What a promising looking game. The water effects are the best I have ever seen, and the story is actually pretty cool, if not a bit hokey. The voice acting is awful for the most part. Gameplay wise, it's solid enough but even at the end (which I cannot beat due to incredibly cheap boss design) I was losing touch with the controls. What is that secret sauce which some games lack and thus never create a transparent, intuitive connection to the player? As much as I loved working my way through this game, warts and all, the fact that I shall probably never endure the suffering required to beat it, means I shall feel forever cheated.

												this game doesnt know what its trying to beFirst its really poorly controlled platforming, then it throws puzzles like tomb raider except not as good or well thought out, then its thrust you in by the second act into a poorly done third person shooterThe story is laughably bad, The game is set in the mid 21st century when the world has fallen into the chaos of the ""Great Population Flood"", and takes place aboard the Queen of the World, a city-sized luxury ocean vessel, built by a group known as the Five Founding Fathers At the beginning of the game, the craft is bombed by a group of fanatical terrorists known as the Malthusians—named after political economist Thomas Malthus who predicted that population growth would one day outpace agricultural production, returning society to a subsistent level of existence.[6] The Malthusians have a plan to murder the vast majority of humans on the planet, so that the survivors wouldn't suffer from the effects of the population explosion.  written on the walls such as ""kill yourself"" which you find all over the ship you play Kate Wilson who is an engineer on the ship & whines about everything while getting her friend nick to help her get off the slowly sinking shipThe writing for this story is beyond terrible, its cringe worthyfor example Kate gets mad at nick for not warning her about 2 enemies in the next room, his response ""kate i have 2 balls & none are crystal""  This line right here made me want to drop the controller Hydrophobia feels like a nice little tech demo to display this new Hydro engine, which the water is beautiful buttttt why should i care when your game built for the engine is so cocking awfulAvoid at all cost			",333,46,9,28,18,4,43

												Game shows some promise, especially for under $1usd... It can be a bit clunky at times (get used to using controllers, because many games now are set up for controller first and it just makes things easier), the premise was kind of neat.... But it looks like it is only part of a whole and WAS going to be an episodic release type game so you will finish it rather quickly and wonder where it was supposed to go from there. I like the water and swimming mechanic and the shooting isn't bad either... Just extremely short and missing an overall reach. But was definately a buck or more worth of entertainment.

												This felt like a tech demo more than anything but what caught my eye was the graphics, which are done fairly well.  The company who made this game does have promise.  However, I've thumbs down this simply because the game felt way too rushed and the controls got buggy on me at times.  Not to mention the story, it kinda fills you in what it's about but at the same just leaves an empty hole.  If you're looking for a good 'interupter' game and this is on sale (Got it for 74 cents!), then by all means try it out.  This is a very short game, and not worth much more because it felt very empty with bad voice acting not to mention a really EMPTY ending.			",154,28,1,39,3,1,4

I just wanted to get the game over with and when it was, I didn't feel any better about it. The ending is very anticlimactic. The game is very short.

												I regret buying this game. Sure I may have paid only 49 cents for it, but the game also took a valuable 30 minutes I could have spent sitting on a cactus. My laptop can run Bioshock Infinite at 60 fps on medium settings but bursts into flames when trying to handle this incredibly ugly game, barely reaching 20 fps when all the graphics are set to minimum and the resolution is Playstation 2 era 640x480.You play as... some woman whose name I can't remember, who's on a boat for.... some reason with some dribbling♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you're boat is suddenly attacked by... something... and you need to escape to... somewhere, and you do this by fighting the horrible camera controls, which fly up and down as if the game was being shot by a person on a malfunctioning crane lift - and suffering a seizure. You try to travel through water with unwieldy swimming controls, making it so that you constantly dive under water for no reason other than ""screw you"", and from time to time, a button prompt will appear telling you to press 'E' to climb a ladder to pick up an object, only for the game to not register your button press until you've backed up and tried pressing 'E' three more times.This isn't even the sort of game like Ride to Hell or pre-patch Total War: Rome II, which could best be described as ""hilariously bad"", where you could call up a few of your mates and laugh together at the baffling levels of ineptitude on display. It's just teeth-grindingly annoying, especially when the mandatory 3rd-person Uncharted-style climbing bits show up where you can't jump from one pipe to another, your vision in impaired by all the water splashing on the camera, and you can neither look nor climb down because trying to program that was much more work than simply waiting for the player to die and respawn at the far away check point.I don't even want to continue this review. I've used up far more time thinking about Hydrophobia than it deserves on top of the half hour I spent trying to work through the glitches, bugs, terrible graphics, and framerate the speed of a powerpoint presentation. My money was stolen; my time was wasted; my Steam library carries another scar; atrocious game gets to ♥♥♥♥ off.			",81,25,0,19,3,0,14

												The water effects and quantity in this game are great, but pretty much nothing else even approaches average.Apparently, this was supposed to be episode 1 in a trilogy, but the rest will never get made, so the player character ends the story on a cliffhanger and the other main good guy character simply disappears late in the game and never reappears. The game literally ends with what feels like an incomplete cutscene.Voice acting is bad. Reminded me of the ""Reboot"" series from the 90s or something similar. Everyone kind of seemed like small-town community theatre actors.One of my ""cardinal sins"" of bad game design is introducing completely new game mechanics in the final 5-10% of the game, and this game does that.Gameplay is repetitive and sometimes unclear, and the only ""challenges"" come from frustrating design decisions like very unclear routes you have to take while your oxygen supply requires you to go directly to the exit with no detours, as well a couple areas with respawning enemies that you can't see under the water.Combat is average or below. There are thousands of explodable objects that you can use to kill enemies, which means very little challenge, really.The final boss fight is pretty stupid and easy.All in all, the game will take you about 2.5-3 hours to beat, although it really does feel tedious even at that length.Anyways, if you've got $0.50 and really really really want to see some nice water effects, you might want to buy it, but there are probably over 500 better games that cost less than $5 on Steam if you're willing to wait for sales, and life is pretty short...

												The game despite being short and quite repetative is worth playing. Why? First let me tell you what is wrong with the game (there is quite a lot!)Cons:-Character handles poorly, especially in 3 deminsional environments.-Story lacking explaination and execution.-Character develpoment: Non Existant.-Missions very repetative.-Platforming not imaginative (in most cases).-Enemies are not very difficult to defeat.-Voice acting is quite bad.-Lip syncing is awful.-Repeated models (for example in one scene two identical men, are lined up and exacuted)...Now you are probably thinking, 'What is the point of playing this game then?'The most standout feature of this game is the level of exploration. At times the game reminds me of the film Posidon Adventure. The game is very good at making the player second guess themselves, and ask questions. Now while this level of exploration is not consistant, for the parts that it is in makes this game highly enjoyable.This game for me personally is a showcase (eventhough to my knowlege it is not), a showcase of the possibilities for games made by larger companies. For example if bioshock or bioshock 2 implmeted the water system that this game uses it could have been probably one of the best games of the decade (it still is very good).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The voice acting is terrible and the jokes are really corny. Most of them are pretty facepalm worthy. The gameplay isn't half bad though. That seems to be its redeeming quality. It's a little frustrating at times, as in not always clear where you need to go or what you need to do, but that happens in some games. Not a big deal. I haven't been confused enough to check a walkthrough or anything. I bought it on sale a while back and honestly I'm glad I did. It has interesting ideas, but less than great execution. I just get the feeling that it could've been better. It's fun to play, though. If you aren't a fan of underwater combat and other things of that nature, I'd say avoid it. If you're going to buy it, I would suggest getting it on sale. The story is kinda ""meh"", but I've seen worse. It seems like one of those games that's more about gameplay than story. Still, if you think it looks interesting, I'd say give it a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although my feelings for this game are mixed, I'm going to give it a recommendation. It's not necesarily a bad game (at least if you have a responsive keyboard and mouse--something I did not have a majority of the game), but the entire story feels rushed. The ending is just kind of there and I found myself questioning what even happened to every main character--except Mila. The voice acting and music is mediocre, but they do their jobs fine. The highlight of the game would have to be the visuals--especially the water. The game isn't very difficult (I played on hard mode and only took more than an hour and a half  because my keyboard was running low on batteries), but the difficulty could be both a good or bad aspect depending on the player. Overall, the game isn't great but considering it's $4.99 and goes on sale for $0.49, it's a solid buy. In short, I give Hydrophobia a solid 75/100 and a buy it if you have the extra change.

												This game is basicly an action adventure game with excellent, actually the best in any game so far, water physics. Playing around with the water is really fun. It makes lots of waves and comes out of doors when you open them to flood the connecting room. So awesome! Enemies will attack you from land and fom inside the water (which is cool!) and they bleed out nicely.Shooting doesn't feel too great unfortunately. The controls could be better. The framerate on my system (which isn't the greatest nowadays) is rather eratic. However I had a lot of fun besides these issues and the game is definitely worth it's price. BTW it is 3 hrs long. A challenge room (which I didn't play) will add a few hrs if you like that kind of thing.			",134,15,2,7,7,0,12

I didn't find the story really all that boring, I'm just disappointed that you don't get your powers until late in the game when they're a bit irrelevant.  (I'm so used to shooting my guns that I don't know if I'll use the powers much.)  I also liked that the main focus, water, had life to it.  It wasn't just something that was everywhere and utterly useless, you could actually use it to progress in the game.  Need to go up one level but no stairs/ladder/etc?  Can't go through a door because there is a fire right in front of it?   Shoot a wall and ride the flood.   Need to get to the next part of the story and don't feel like killing your way through a group of 10 guys?  You guessed it, OPEN THE FLOOD GATES AND SHOOT DOWN SOME POWER LINES.  Too many indie developers go for generic, popular themes such as the ever popular Zombie shooter or some post-apocalyptic world that has little to no back story as to how things happened (or it takes forever to know the full story).  It's refreshing that they did their own spin on a futuristic dying Earth where the problem was over-population and not some catastrophic apocolyptic event.  For $5($0.49 during steam sales), this game gives you your money's worth and 8 times out of 10 you'll enjoy playing this for a few hours.  I got this through a Humble Bundle, so I didn't pay more than $0.10 for it, therefore take what I say with a grain of salt.			",94,18,0,19,17,0,9

												A short but wild ride. The game keeps you on your toes and offers enough diversity to be very thrilling for the 4 hours it takes. Neat graphics, controller support and interesting water physics make up for the lack of story and uninteresting music entirely.			",315,92,28,47,39,6,68

												Overall? Poor. Puzzles? Abysmal. Combat? Terrible. Water Combat? Even Worse. Story? Okay. Movement? Incredibly non-fluent. Voice acting? OH MY GOD PLEASE STOP. Water Physics? Fan-♥♥♥♥ing tastic. Hydrophobia Prophecy is an extremely poor game surrounding an amazing engine. I wish the water was put out by fire. I wish I could play with the water. I wish there was more combat involving environmental factors. I wish the AI wasn't completely stupid. I wish the water was involved in puzzles instead of poor gimicky combat. Basically, I wish Hydrophobia Prophecy was a good game. Look at the logo. It shows you using the lovely magic water power. You don't get that in a long long time. By then, the game frustrated me beyond redemption, and even then playing with the water was disappointing. I do not recommend it. And that's sad, because I can't tell if watching the great water physics was worth the 4.79 I paid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Normaly i whould say a game for -90% (0,49€) you should buy.Sure this game has a nice graphic, and the story isnt so bad.But ending up in the totaly bug of S.A.R.A. fight made me hatte this game.Not even that it multiple times does not recognize the barrel infront of the target, S.A.R.A. even hitsyou tru the walls.Worst of all is the water skill controlling, its horrible, its so damn stupid to try to make it go forward or backwards from frontprespectiv, it just stays at spot and doesnt move nowhere or just inch by inch very slowly, or even in the wrong direction.So if you can handle the frustration doing a fight over and over again a dozzen of times just to win it with luck to not have bugs, buy the game			",182,63,0,53,14,0,11

												Got it for free so, the best sale. I read somewhere that you have a 7 hours campaign. But it's all around 2,5-3 hours. In times of Steamsales it seems worth 2€ not more. The game is not that bad. It has some kind of problems where I was thrown back to the '90. Clone enemies, only one model for civs, the controls are a bit slow. I just don't understand why you gave THE hint in the endbossfight. The water looks great, the grafics of it are a bit off but the dynamic makes it worth. Never felt fluid water like that. I hope after the disappointing ending you would do a second titel. But I think the hopes are off limits.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not the greatest game ever, the entire game feels very clunky, difficult to tell where people are shooting at you from, where the heck you’re going, and walking around is difficult, and swimming can be downright impossible. These serve to make the game infuriating, as you bumble your way around a sinking ship; being shot at by everybody you meet. What’s worse is the game’s supposedly ‘unique’ water powers don’t show up until basically the end of the game, and they are SUPER lame. All you can do is pick up stuff and toss it around using giant pillars of water. And as soon as you get these powers the game is basically over after a very annoying boss battle.Honestly, the game sucks. It’s basically a half-baked piece of crap. The game has a very interesting premise, and with more work could have been a good game. Sadly the game falls very short of anything close to fun, and can only be described as an annoying experience that you keep waiting to get better, when you finally expect it to get good, the game ends. My recommendation is to not get this game, if for some god awful reason you want this game get it while on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is basicly an action adventure game with excellent, actually the best in any game so far, water physics. Playing around with the water is really fun. It makes lots of waves and comes out of doors when you open them to flood the connecting room. So awesome! Enemies will attack you from land and fom inside the water (which is cool!) and they bleed out nicely.Shooting doesn't feel too great unfortunately. The controls could be better. The framerate on my system (which isn't the greatest nowadays) is rather eratic. However I had a lot of fun besides these issues and the game is definitely worth it's price. BTW it is 3 hrs long. A challenge room (which I didn't play) will add a few hrs if you like that kind of thing.			",134,15,2,7,7,0,12

												Hydrophobia: Prophecy....it's not terrible.Pros:-Water graphics and physics are great in this game.- It frequently goes on sale. (I got the game for 49 cents or something like that.)Cons:-Controls. It seems like the game wants to be played on a controller rather than M/KB.-Gameplay seems uneven. It seems like the devs put a huge emphasis on the first act/ act and a half of the game but then just gave up near the end. I would have liked to have mini-bosses for each act.-Story is nothing to write home about. Terrorists being terrorists and what not. AND SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS!Conclusion:I'm going to recommend this game despite it's flaws with the stipulation that you buy it on sale. The game is short. I beat the game in about 5 hours. It's not a great game but it's not terrible and it would at least be something to keep you busy for 5 hours.			",12,4,0,1,0,0,0

												This game for me was actually quite fun, despite it being fairly short, and the fact that this is only part one of what was supposed to be a 3 part series, but never made it past this.Now, yes I recommend the game, however there's a few things you should probably keep in mind before judging this review.1. This game does not have a complete ending, nor will it ever as far as I can tell.2. It's story isn't something memorable.Why would I recommend this game? It's actually not a bad game, it's just not complete, and that's what killed it, I ran into very few bugs/glitches while playing this game, which shows me they at least took the time to polish it out a little, regardless of where it ended.Take this game as you wish, it was fun while it lasted, but it's too bad we'll never know the ending to the story, oh well! Anyways, again, would recommend you buy this game under the circumstances listed above, well at least if you just don't care about them that is.			",264,54,7,39,39,3,78

												Probably one of the only games to have such a majority of underwater combat. This was a really fun game, though pretty short. The water simulation was as real as they advertise, and controlling the water later in the game is a definitely good feeling. Sure it takes about half the game to get the water powers, but it reminds me of KotOR; you spend most of your time on Taris as a non-Jedi, but getting those Jedi powers makes it oh so worth it. Also, while dying numerous times, I experienced no glitches.Srsly. On sale for $0.50, you can't go wrong. I only wish they'd make a sequel...or give it Steam Workshop support.			",90,5,0,8,9,2,8

												Hydrophobia's got novel gameplay and setting, and some seriously impressive water (I spent a lot of time staring at it through the wireframe scanner... the tech is beautiful). Water (and fear of water) are used very well to implement some unique and fun gameplay. Cool hacking and a smooth introduction of new gameplay throughout the game keep it interesting, and the story is promising, as well.Unfortunately this game's clearly rushed near the end, with a large amount of story elements and gameplay mechanics presented to the player all at once. This was originally going to be an episodic release and never saw any sequels. The game still reaches an ending that's fairly satisfying, despite that.The survival mode you unlock by winning at least serves as a fun way to explore the cool new moves they introduce at the end.

												Where do I start? First of all, I'm guilty of playing this game on a computer that barely meets the minimum requirements. I have to say, the graphics are phenomenal, the rendering is near perfect and the enviromental effects (water, fire, smoke) are absolutely stunning. It's truly a beautiful game, but after you get past oogling at it's undercarriage you realize a few things:  The controls are as spastic as a schizophrenic hummingbird, the storyline is painfully generic and the gameplay is complete crap. This is the ""fixed"" edition of the game that the devs gave a once over because of previous complaints and It still sucks. When you're a 110 pound girl in a cruise ship filling fast with water and shaking like a crack-♥♥♥♥♥ in rehab, fine tuned controls mean everything, and when you can't even get that right, you've got a game that's doomed from the start. This game is like buying a '67 Shelby Cobra in mint condition without a steering wheel and the break lines are cut. Disappointed...			",149,13,0,10,19,1,7

Honestly, I picked up an illegal copy and thought it was going to be good but after seeing what a difficult mess I would need to go through, not worth it. I paid the price and removed my illegal copy so please give me what I want and I will come back to this review and edit it to a good one.The specs that it shows it requires are lies.

												Not at all a perfect game, Hydrophobia is a little mediocre as a shooter, and it's low budget shows from time to time. Individual segments feel hit or miss, but give it a try though and you will find some uniquely fun puzzles and water based combat. The water is the real star here, as Hydrophobia's developers seem to have made the game as a showcase for their fluid rendering engine. (Before going bankrupt shortly after) The water effects and physics are the best I have seen to date, and the sinking ship feels oppressive and urgent. Its a lot of fun just to play with the water in the ship's corridors.Taking it for what it is, I had more fun in Hydrophobia's campy, sometimes muddled world than I have had in most AAA titles.

												Hydrophobia can be interesting or flat out boring, depending on whether you let flaws get in the way or not. Like most people, I have gotten this game in a bundle on Bundle Stars.Graphics: Decent. Though they appear ""shiny"" and can make it rather difficult to play, they aren't horrible and can be much worse. Like many other people have pointed out and a big part of the game, the water details are stunning even when set on the lowest texture setting.Gameplay: When it comes to rating a game I try to stay positive, but let's be real now. The controls are god awful. There are plenty of alternatives the developers could have used to make the controls simple and easy to learn. Instead, I have to smash my keyboard to get off from cornering the wall. The story line isn't too bad, but is overly cheesy.Sound Effects and voice acting: Sound effects are neat-o. The voice acting isn't too great but at least they were putting in an attempt. Believe me when I say I have heard MUCH worse.Overall Score: 3/5. It's better than what most people make it as, but isn't THAT great. It's entertaining to play if you have nothing else to do, but not worth the asking price. Wait for it to go on sale or get it in a bundle.			",79,20,1,9,10,2,3

												This game plays a lot like if Tomb Raider were made by an indie developer, except replace Lara Croft with the whiniest protagonist since my gigapet who I refused to feed in 4th grade. Seriously, the real hero in the story is Scoot for having to put up with it.That being said, it's a lot of fun. I'm not far along in the game, but it's got some epic moments only minutes into gameplay. Outrunning the waves of water that plow into the rooms and explode out the walls is extremely impressive and very cool.The story is very great as well for as much as I've played. Basically you're on a ship (I think?) that's being taken over by a terrorist group/cult and sunk into the ocean. You play as Kate, who I'm assuming was like a Cruise assistant lady or something...I don't know, and I don't care. This game has done me a huge favor in sparing me the dumb details and giving me a simple, kill the terrorist, escape the ship, and don't drown experience. Also everytime she says ""Jesus,"" in a bad situation, it sounds like she is literally addressing the Son of God. You'll hear it everytime now too. Enjoy!			",298,57,3,34,10,1,28

												Unique. Certainly not the longest game I've ever played nor the most in depth story, but unique to be sure. A nice assortment of weapon ammo with various ways to dispatch enemies, whether that be through direct damage, explosion, fire, or drowning.  Nifty mapping system with a neat pda-style way of locating objectives.  There is constantly the sensation of feeling like you're about to drown, especially since about 50% of the game takes place underwater.  All in all a pretty good game.  I'm glad I played it, enjoyable enough to experience the water physics alone.  I give it a solid ""B"".  Not B-, not B+, just ""B"".			",836,204,54,120,86,10,161

												The water is cool I will give them that but the FPS on this game is Sh$@. I don't know what the fps actually is but it dosnt seem like 60 and at times is like under 30 I think (yes my PC should be able to play this well past 60) It drops in places and dosnt run well in general which is fine if you have a high end pc but be warned. It loses save files which is sad because I'm not going to go back and redo somthing that I didnt enjoy that much in the first place. I dont think the game is bad to say but its not very clear on what to do or where to go. Theres lots of platforming stuff I don't think fits the game. I don't want to uber biased because I lost my save file. ( not sure how it got lost in the cloud I don't think it uplodes right honestly. I have come across countless buggs. The first cutscene is where it goes to $@#$. I don't usally write bad reviews but Ive tryed this on a few dif computers and the buggs and framerate is the same even when testing it on a old computer. Theres not much positive to say honestly :( I can't recommend this at full price but for what I payed which was like 40 cents sure why not.			",238,75,0,64,14,2,26

												When I wrote the evaluation I'm at the final boss and achived 54% of the steam succes for this game.Imagine a world when the water have subbmerge a lot to say not the entire earth and puts the humanity to live under it. And then, terrorist appear from nowhere. Ok, it may not make sense. But the woman you will play with is a badass for kicking terrorists.Actually, the scenario is not bad, and after the half of the game, your caracter will have a great power that make the gameplay a little bit more powerfull. The gun with the different type of amunation is a good thing too for the gameplay.I found some camera and IA bug, just little onces. Nothing very bad that make you quit. The gameplay is fine for me, you have a lot of possibilities. Cover behind boxes or walls. Swiming is a little bit hard to learn when you want to do up and downs in the water. You can catch object in the water ... That kind of stuf.The final boss is pretty hard, I saw a video to help but he is pretty hard. And the game is quick to finish, but the succes are a challenge you can not avoid ;) .I do not really find a lot of bad point for this game. If you are a fan of Oni, the Bungie game that was on PC and PS2 in 2001-2002, you will like the game.For me it's a 14/20.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, i really wanted to like this game, but it just does not deliver.. Controls are clunky, especially the kind of superpower that you will get literally 5mins before the finale. Too bad you'll need it to win that ridiculous boss battle. Story has so many dead ends (for example line with the secondary character just ends abruptly and you will never heard about him ever since, I know that devs maybe wanted to use that for sequel, but still) and also the ending feels very rushed and anti-climaxic. It is not entirely bad, but you just can't help to feel, that it could have been so much more.. Oh, and who hired the voice actress for the main protagonist? Also who thought that she should moan constantly when you are even ankles deep in the water which.. DUH!.. you will be pretty often.. Sry but i can't recommend it unles you REALLY love water physics, don't mind ankward controls, mediocre story with rushed end and last but not least bad voice acting.			",457,138,29,63,52,6,62

												Shorthand: Game was decent but had room for more. Felt pretty short but kept things moving along. much of it was disorienting yet felt familiar enough from other games. Worth 5 bucks (price as of review posting)  The gameplay was pretty decent. the concept was surely there, but the end result felt very incomplete and somewhat unsatisfying.   The power ups were fun, the weapon diversity was good enough, but like the power ups, the better stuff came way too late in the game to enjoy. Especially while fighting the end boss. I got frustrated because it felt so suddenly almost impossible that if you didn't master the controls and special powers they JUST literally gave you in the last few levels, you are not going to win on your first try (that or i just totally suck at gaming) not to mention i didn't even realize I was fighting the end boss til I actually beat it (about a dozen tries) and was expecting the next level to load.--Grats if you read this far!SoRabo Studios thanks you for reading this review and if you bought this game after considering this review, YAY! if not. aww. ok, tired, rambling, punctuation mis-use, words.

												Great game. Sadly not good triple monitor experience.You need a desktop graphics card to run this game, i mean its not exactly the most demanding thing out there but with the heavy water detail, yeah you need something better then you usual. Im sad, i have to play this game on 1080p. It looks nice on triple hd, but it has some severe problems with the interface. Also take to note that thsi game is pretty old, they probably weren't thinking about 3k or triple hd. The game runs fine, it looks nice enough has a decent story, its just for that small crowd, that does the triple monitor or 4k be aware. Otherwise its great!EDIT: Man i did some messing around, figured out some thing about how to ensure i can play as much as i can with triple monitors. I used to love this game. Its sad, the lack of support for such a awkward aspect ratio. I mean graphically they used an awesome engine, its looks great runs great. Just mechanically, its total trash. Imma have to remove surround and play with it as 1080p. Also i believe the story is saved to your steam account, so no matter what comp you log into, you still have yor process saved, which is amazing ofr this old of a game. 2011, not decades old, but not new non the less.

												I bought this game despite the negative reviews because I remember playing a demo for it a while back on Xbox Live. I remember enjoying the short demo, but it was too expensive at the time. I played the first 1 and a half acts....and I don't even really want to continue.The graphics are low quality for today's standards, so it isn't all that attractive. The graphics kind of give me a headache. And I am, by no means, a graphics buff.In addition, the controls and the camera are just...disorienting. I found myself getting a little dizzy, even after turning down the mouse sensitivity.And then the gameplay is frustrating. There were several times when I had no idea what to do. And that's not because the game doesn't hold your hand. It tells you exactly where to go next. It's just graphically not clear how to get there. I spent 15 minutes walking around a room because there was a place I needed to get to that I knew I should be able to get to by climbing the piping, but she wouldn't grab the pipe for no reason at all. I finally found out I needed to shoot out a wall and that the pipe I was trying to grab was just...not intended to be grabbed...It was slightly bigger than the pipes you use throughout the game, but they expected you to just ignore this path in favor of shooting a wall.I still think I'm going to finish the game, because I hate leaving games unfinished. I already spent an hour and  a half on the game, I may as well spend the second hour and a half to get the payoff. Because I know the gameplay and graphics aren't the strong points of this game. It must be the story, right?I'm dreading re-opening the game....I wouldn't wish this on anyone. Don't bother with this game.			",42,33,0,12,0,0,1

The only thing to be careful of is that it might not run well depending on your system. If there's one setting you not sacrifice I would recommend water effects, since that's really what Hydrophobia is all about.

												A fun game, but too short and the water control that is the main selling point of the game is only available for the last hour or so of gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game with lots of cool things to do,the most impressive is the dynamic water and the game graphical engine wich is unique so far			",236,33,2,31,67,0,54

												Although not impressive, yields a great entertainment, with its water and its interaction scenario. It is a game that is worth even more for its modest price.			",89,44,0,6,0,3,4

												A fairly meh game. Has some fu physical elements but doesn't really deliver what it promises. Combat feels a tad boring. Worth a try if your interested in the water gimmick but I'd only pick it up on sale (75%) etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty decent game. Gunplay can be a little iffy at times and I wish the story was a whole lot longer, but otherwise a fun couple of hours			",219,34,3,14,17,6,30

												The game is ""Ok"". I wouldn't give it no more than a 6.5. All I'm saying is that it is playable when you're in one of those bored mood days and just want some slight entertainment. In that case this game is for you. Just don't pay full price for it but rather get it cheap either during sales time or daily deal.			",288,76,3,18,5,1,10

												I liked this game, both its platforming and its action parts. The mechanic when water begins to flood the rooms you're in (happens often) and underwater combat are great.			",90,36,1,25,13,0,23
