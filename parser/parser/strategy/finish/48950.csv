												Greed Corp is a turn-based strategy game that you can play either singleplayer, vs up to three pcs, or multiplayer.  The story is a basic one for each of the four playable groups; however, their differences in-game are graphical only.  The full story took me around twelve or so hours to complete.Greed Corp uses a hexagon-tile battlefield in which you can use the land in order to gain more money to buy units and buildings.  However, the more you use the land to gain money, the more it deteriorates and disappears completely.  It is a delicate balance between building units to conquer land and kill enemy units, using the land for money before your opponents do, and conserving the strength and number of tiles in your control.  The win condition is to be the last player left standing.I greatly enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a turn-based strategy game.  Learning how to play the game is fairly easy, but there is definitely strategy to be had in this game.			",62,16,1,16,11,0,20

												A fantastic indie game with a moral that, though prevalent throughout the campaign, doesn't overshadow the wonderful mechanics of the game itself. The game is focused around a world made up of tall hexagon-shaped pillars which stand in the middle of a massive ocean. The various factions which occupy the world have finally begun to reach the bottom of the seemingly endless supply of resources in the ground and their constant drilling and mining has caused large portions of the world to simply collapse into the ocean. The turn-based mechanics are easy to grasp and are complex enough to let even veterans of such games enjoy the fun. The graphics quality is fantastic with a low setting capable of running on very low end machines. The game does possess a significant amount of replayability thanks to the multiplayer mode although the single player campaign is reasonably fun the second time around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know, even with how obscure this game is, it's possibly one of the best strategy games I have ever played just for the pure sake that it's so simple, but so mentally, strategically challenging. Territory only lasts for so long, since you harvest money from the land, and that land is slowly destroyed because of it. The war can only go for so long before somebody's section crumbles and falls down into the endless abyss of clouds.			",174,20,5,20,28,2,17

												At first blush, this game seemed like it would be pretty good - but that feeling doesn't hold up over time.   While there are 4 different factions in the game, they share the same 4 units.  The single player campaign quickly becomes tedious when all battles consist of the same exact strategy,  I can imagine this game might be more enjoyable multiplayer, but that aspect is pretty dead.

												How horrible of me, to have forgotten to write a review for this game. Go and play it. Greed Corp is a great example of a game with a few, simple mechanics that is easy to learn and harder to master. I liked most things about it - the low count of units and associated rules, the gameplay mechanics (especially the collapsing terrain), the visual style. 10/10 will buy for my friends, too.

												greed corp is a turn based hex game but different to most strategy games. the difference is its much more simple. but that is what makes it awesome! so simple yet so fun.the game takes place on some world were either incredibly cute walker like robots or people piloting incredibly cute walker type machines live. the place they live is also so way high up in the sky that it would probably take half an hour to hit the ground if you fell off. and its divided into hexes that you fight over.the fighting or gameplay is very simple. you can either build a barracks or harvester to start off with. harvesters harvest the floor to make you money but also destroy the floor as they do it. and when a piece of land is destroyed enough it falls down into the clouds taking everything with it.in other words harvesters can be an effective weapon for destroying your foes land while making you money in the process.when you build  a barracks you can build walkers. walkers can claim 1 hex forward per turn and battle your opponents walkers.except the battles are  little more just basic math as the walkers simply cancel each other out. so who ever has more walkers will win.and once you claim a hex you can build on it also the more hexes you have the more money you get per turn.the 2 other things you can build are the air ship and the cannon. the air ship transports all the walkers on one hex across the map and are the only way of getting around late game as nearly everything is broken... most of the time.the cannon on the other hand is used to shoot a hex. when a hex is shot it moves down one level getting more broken. it is the same thing as what a harvester does and when a hex losses all of its levels it crumbles into the clouds. cannons also kill 5 walkers so your foes will have less men.so that's basically how the game goes you harvest stuff break the land while doing it then get cannons and air ships and either try and conquer your opponents land or break it.also the theme of the game is very nice with the greedy theme being taken very light heartedly and the way fighting works having no actual fighting or blood at all. if I gave this game a ERSB rating it would probably be PG for very mild violence.as for the real rating I give it a 8/10 and a 9/10 if its on sale for $3 or less. for it being a really good game to play with friends but maybe not so much with sore losers. it also has a great steampunk style awesome funky soundtrack and last of all great mechanics.

												This a small TBS worth due to it's simplicity and effectiveness in its mechanics. It is a Risk styled game, where you control a faction that must destrtoy all enemy factions in a hexagonal tile base map. In order to do thta, players must generate income, done so by placing Harvesters accross the field; the important bit here is that harvesters generate income by smashing the tile where it was placed, in addition to all adjacent tiles; every time a tile is smashed, it lowers it's height, reaching a point where the tile fractures and subsequently collapses - what this means is that, as income is generated, the battlefield gets eventually destroyed, and by the end game, its rather common that only a couple of tiles remain in the whole battlefield.The game is entirely deterministic - no dice is rolled at all. A duel is resoleved by the size of the attacking force, with the casualties determined by simple substraction (invading force unit count - defending force unit count). Addionally, all maps are perfectly symmetrical. This leaves the game's conflict to be entirely resolved by player's strategy and nothing else. This is easier said than done, however, as the tile destruction inflicted by harvesters (and player-deployed artillery) constantly change the battlefield, your strategy is in an ever constant need for change.The game lacks a bit of variety, so it can easily become a little repetitive - this is not Chess nor Go in regards to depth. An expande sequel would have been indeed welcome, but this never came to pass. I still recommend it heartily if you are a fan of TBS.			",529,151,17,92,62,3,162

												I'm normally not into turn-based strategy games, since the gameplay is slow and there's not a lot of action involved, and this game is no different. If you do like these kind of games, you'll most likely enjoy this one as well. But don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game by any means. It has a certain charm, and the game is easy to play. The towers gameplay aspect is a pretty cool idea. But when it comes to turn-based strategy games I'd rather play Advance Wars. Man, that game just plain rocked ! But that's a story for another time...[Rating: 71/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												I bought this game during the 2014 holiday sale when I had a few bucks left over and nothing else on my wish list. I am very glad I got it now, as opposed to the other prospects I had lined up. This game plays like Risk, but has some really awesome new mechanics that make the game worth getting. The biggest mechanic is the game's titular use of greed to change the landscape: you can use harvesters to work the land and get money, but ever time you do, the land they stand on is slowly lowered until it collapses. This introduces some seriously awesome strategies in the game; one time I planted a harvester in the middle of an enemy island in order to collapse it and take out everyone on the island. I didn't have to use any of my troops or engage in a time-consuming siege- all I had to do was attack an unprotected square my opponent had left neglected, plant a harvester there, and laugh as the ground literally crumbled under their troops. This review is getting really long, but let me just tell you this before I finish: GET THIS GAME. It's definitely worth it, and the only things wrong with it aren't even part of the game itself, they're problems with the developer, whom has discontinued supporting the game and thusly Greed Corp's servers are dead. The campaign is about 10 hours of gameplay, and it's pretty nice. However, the true worth of this game comes from the multiplayer, which can still happen... we always find a way. My only regrets is that this game doesn't have any steam workshop support, and that the developer seems to have done a disappearing act.			",105,16,1,16,9,1,23

												Not as bad as it might look, not as good as I thought. Greed Corps just isn't very deep, and once you master the mechanics winning or losing will be more a matter of luck than one would expect from a turn based tactics game. 1 vs 1 matches against the AI are fun, more than that it's just let them fight among themselves and just finish them off. The worst aspect is that the online multiplayer doesn't work. In fact it haven't worked for years.			",463,237,16,78,53,5,84

												This game is challenging.  As many other reviewers have noted, there isn't much in the way of multiplayer gameplay, which leaves the majority of the game to be played as Single Player.  The problem with single player strategy games is it can be difficult to determine what your opponent is going to do.  Sometimes your ""Skilled"" or ""Expert"" opponent is an imbecile, and other times they are Alexander the Great.The game is frustratingly difficult.  Part of that is in no small part because it revolves around four units, physics, and board game mechanics.  If this were a more popular game, or at least had steam integration so I could invite friends to play it, this would be a great time waster with friends.  However, as it stands, its an ultimately just a test of patience.			",95,12,5,25,20,2,21

												Good game and I really enjoyed it, but it's also fairly flat in depth.  There really isn't a lot going on in it.  Each battle plays out pretty much the same as the last, with some variations due to differences in map design.  Still, I enjoyed the unique combat and how the terrain worked well enough to recommend it.  I think everyone should check it out, but after you get how to fight/win there really isn't anything else going on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A new take on an old formula. It's RISK gets greedy in this turn-based strategy game. The dice roll mechanics are simplified to a straight ""walker vs walker"" (the only unit) numbers game with the edge going to the attacker. But then add in buildings, the most iconic of which is the harvester. It adds resources each turn that you can use to build more buildings and walkers, but it also lowers the tile it's on -- until it crumbles and ""falls off"" the map, taking any of your units and buildings (or the enemy's) on that tile with it. Now start considering those as offensive weapons and the game just got way more interesting.			",150,72,3,27,23,1,33

												Greed Corp gives a unique way of planning out a TBS. While you naturally want large forces, the production of forces comes directly from destroying the ground beneath your own feet. This turns an otherwise aesthetically pleasing but unoriginal game into a very compelling game, and also opens may types of attacks and force build ups. As an added bonus, it's (or sometimes is) a very cheap game to buy, giving hours of enjoyment in medium sized battles for pennies on the dollar.			",337,57,3,45,43,3,60

None of the factions has an advantage over another. Certainly not as deep as Civ, but still impressively replayable.Recommended for fans of board/tabletop games and jackhammers.

												This is probably the only turn-based strategy game I have ever liked, so far at least.Its rounds are short, simple, and are accompanied by a particularly snazzy jazz soundtrack.It's also very winnable-- maybe that's why I like it.Either way, worth a shot.			",95,29,0,2,7,0,14

												A round-based board game at heart, Greed Corp makes you fight your way through a 24-map single player campaign, destroying your enemies with your workers, cannons or by just removing the ground they are standing on. It's definitely following the 'easy to learn, hard to master' approach, with just a few possible moves working together to create a surprisingly sophisticated strategical challenge.The original idea is that your main source of income comes from harvesting the ground below you -- which then quickly breaks down, so you need to keep moving. Gaining money is closely tied into gameplay, as in that being greedy really limits your other options a lot.Clean graphics, day/night cycles, cleverly written mission briefings and debriefings, it all adds up to a astonishing level of polish for an indie game. The swingy and jazzy music isn't the obvious choice, but it's great and ends up being surprisingly fitting by giving it all a lighthearted feel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great little strategy game with an excellent aesthetic.The gameplay is a fresh variation on classic turn-based strategy action; you need to harvest resources to pay for units, but harvesting will also damage (and eventually destroy) the very land you stand on. It's all about balance.Good scenarios and maps, a great visual style, and awesome retro ragtime soundtrack. It's just a shame the online play is so dead.			",802,239,27,63,64,8,118

												I have only played the tutorial, but if any of you have played Galcon Fusion (Indie Game) then you know what this game will be like. The basic premise is the same. You simply have to have the same amount or more of your ""walkers"" than the enemy to take over their land and destory enemy walkers. However, there are a number of ways to do this. This strategy game maintains a beautifully ""greater in numbers"" turn based tactics but adds diversity too with the addition of different units to utilize. There are long range stationary cannons, transports, walkers, and harvesters (that can both harm you help you and be used as a weapon). Overall, it is an intuitive strategy experience that is part puzzle, part turn based tactics. I definitely recommend this title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first found this game on Android and it recently came up on a Humble bundle. I must admit I very much doubted that it'd scale well to PC, after all there are so many games that just don't scale to a PC well. Greed Corp isn't an exception to this. It's begging for a windowed mode. Let me explain.The strategy and gameplay is still pretty good it's a nice game to just sit and play. It's very area or control based, but doesn't tax your concentration too much. You could easily be playing this whilst watching something else on your computer. If you could window the game it'd be great to multi-task on the computer with. Sadly, I don't seem to be able to do that here.Personally, I'd recommend putting the game on your phone or tablet rather than PC. It's a decent little game and has a fair play time (at least two hours to complete the campaign), but isn't really a fully fledged PC game.			",63,16,2,20,19,0,34

												Greed Corp is akin to checkers, easy to get into but very difficult to master. At first glance, this game may appear to be overly casual. There are two building types in the game, one mortar unit type, one attack unit type, and one transportation unit type. Play it a few times and you will come to realize that this game is anything but casual, frustrating even. To win at all, you will have to be very careful of where you place your mining units which can collapse the platform your other units are standing on. Play recklessly and you end up trapped with nothing left to do but pray for a miracle. I’ll conclude by saying this, if you can stand playing checkers for a dozen hours or more, this game is right up your alley.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												Hex grid turn based strategy game where you destroy terrain to gain resources. The single player campaign can be frustrating because there is no mid-mission saving. The AIs will always either: gang up on you and destroy the terrain under your bases or turtle in a corner for 20 turns and then snipe you from across the map. I haven't tried online but I'm sure they are even more prone to boring, exploitative tactics.If you enjoy strategy games this might be a nice change of pace. However there isn't much depth to it and has very little replay value apart from MP.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												Greed Corp is a rather simple turn-based strategy game. There are no random elements or hidden information, so in practice the game often plays a lot like a puzzle game.The core gameplay is fun enough. You use your walkers to capture territory and your harvesters to generate additional resources. You need to be careful with your harvesters, however, as completely strip mining a hex will make it disappear. You also have access to a few more advanced tools such as stationary cannons used for ranged attacks and carriers that can transport your walkers across the map.Unfortunately the game gets repetitive pretty quickly, at least in single-player mode. The core gameplay is rather simple and while there's some variation in the maps, most of the time you are executing very similar strategies. Even the expert AIs aren't that challenging, and can usually be defeated pretty easily. Furthermore, while the game has four different factions, they all play exactly the same.Greed Corp is not really bad game. However, at least in singleplayer it gets repetitive too quickly and lacks depth. Not recommended unless you have friends to play multiplayer with.The good:- Fun and simple gameplay- Interesting theme/setting- Good controlsThe bad:- Very repetitive- Boring map design- The story is rather forgettable- All four factions play exactly the same- AI is not very good			",564,232,11,89,49,8,102

												Needs a level editor, once you play majority of the maps multiple times, it can get repetitive. Does not even need workshop support, just some level editor so those who own the game can create their own local maps to keep the game interesting. I've played through all the maps multiple times, and you can guess the AI's moves because they react to what the players build. This is a fantastic game, and the only thing missing is the editor, give this some life and a chance, please add an editor, thank you.			",118,21,0,14,50,3,88

												Don't be fooled: although this game is listed as available to download, it is actually only available to play on a series of 3,458 gold-plated floppy disks, each one delivered by specially-trained gibbons who ride on the back of unicorns. I thought this would be a memorable experience in and of itself, but it turns out that gibbons♥♥♥♥♥♥everywhere and I don't have a 3.5"" disk drive anymore. Also, the unicorns stamped my cat to death in a fight over whether Justin Bieber or One Direction have better songs. 7 out of a possible 3 million ornate ming vases.			",83,16,0,18,18,0,38

												This is essentially a computerized board game. Is it good? I don't really know.Here's the problem: there's no online strategy guides available, and nobody has really done any proper analysis of the game. This makes it hard to really get a handle on the strategy. Even if you do spend the time to figure it out yourself, the odds are pretty low that anyone else on your friends list will have done the same.So you're faced with a problem: If you play as a novice, you won't understand the strategy well enough and the outcome will seem almost arbitrary; and if you learn to play the game well, you'll have nobody to play against.

												A very different kind of strategy game, based on non-sustainable resource farming, height advantages and tactical demolition. The story is only there if you want it, presented in big ungainly paragraphs of text, like in Braid. However, the jazzy big band music adds a really nice 'booming 20s' feel to the industrialized madness!As mentioned in several other reviews on this game, there are times when the slightly unforgiving gameplay mechanics create a stalemate; where the first person to move will ultimately lose the match. I have been observing some of the pro players of this game, who appear to have got the turn-based mechanics down to a math.But if you're a fan of cartoony little robot characters, gramophone jazz, or just sick of hearing about global warming and dwindling rainforests, this game is for you! 3/5 from me.

A játék lenyűgöző, egyszerű a kivitelezés, de a játékélmény annál jobb. Egy rossz döntés és törheti az ember a fejét, hogyan vergődik ki a csávából. Elgondolkodtató a játék viszont a zenei aláfestés feloldja ezt egy kicsit.

Its a little unsophisticated (If you're crazy about Starcraft, I say stick to Starcraft) but for someone a little more casual like me who feels daunted by the depth of SC but still wants to play an RTS, this is it.The best part about the game is the slowly fragmented and shrinking land, which adds a cool level of movement strategy to it. I'd say its worth the full price.			",87,38,0,18,15,1,13

												Easy to learn, difficult to master turn-based strategy. Within the first section of the campaign, you will know how to do every single action in the game, and when a game's controls and interface are this accessible, gameplay really does boil down to pure strategy, which is exactly how a great strategy game should be.

												A good little turn-based strategy, almost like a board game.But it's incredibly hard (at least for me), even on the first maps it seems that the computer always makes the perfect step, and if you make one mistake you lost. After getting to the second world I gave up, could not collect enough points to go further.It's a nice game for hardcore strategy gamers who like to suffer.			",305,106,24,30,52,3,94

												A videót nézve megtetszett már a játék, főleg az első másodpercek. Ahogy elindítottam a játékot, majd megcsináltam az első lépéseket ez az érzés csak fokozódott. A játék lenyűgöző, egyszerű a kivitelezés, de a játékélmény annál jobb. Egy rossz döntés és törheti az ember a fejét, hogyan vergődik ki a csávából. Elgondolkodtató a játék viszont a zenei aláfestés feloldja ezt egy kicsit. Na, hogy is fejezzem ki magam, ez egy igazi stratégia és mindenkinek aki csak egy kicsit is a műfaj kedvelője ajánlom, remek kis game :D			",123,19,1,17,10,1,14

												This indie game is a superb light turn-based strategy game, where four different armies clash over hexagonal pillars standing above the clouds. All four sides are functionally the same, but with differing aesthetics. Balance is vital, however, as the money-making harvesters you build will eventually destroy the hexagons around them. As such, the need for money creates a conflict with the need to have an actual battlefield to war upon. This need for balance produces a very unique array of strategies to employ. The music and night-time ambience really adds to the feel of the game, as do the army designs. A light-hearted game that nonetheless provides a challenge thanks to its unique take on resource gathering one so often sees in strategy games.			",103,21,0,8,16,0,13

												Cute tactical game with loads of style. However, a lack of unit variety and depth, plus some slow AI makes the game rather shallow and repetitive. Buy only when on sale.			",292,119,1,83,41,1,84

												Fun board-game concept, but the multiplayer implementation was absolute garbage. Give this one a miss.			",139,27,12,23,18,0,53

												Great game to introduce fans of tabletop boardgames to steam and the strategy video game genre.  Simply to pick up and fun while learning more complex strategies.			",105,10,0,4,8,0,15

												很考验战术的一款小游戏，不能只顾眼前利益，还要考虑后路，当然有时背水一战也会有奇效！作为一款策略类小游戏真的很出色！值得一试！			",162,12,3,7,12,2,17

												It's a fun game...but honestly the third level (Turbo Tunnel) of Battletoads is easier than the third level of Greed Corp.Be prepared to be beaten...by ""Beginner"" level A.I. players.			",1468,453,64,156,138,12,215

												This is a turn-based game with very simple mechanics, almost like a classic strategy game like checkers.  Well, checkers with resource gathering and unit factories, anyway.  But the best part is that resource gathering causes the board to fall apart, which both keeps things lively and gives you something to think about.So if you like that sort of thing — thinking in your games — I recommend giving it a look.  It's got a nice graphical style going for it too.			",276,93,3,56,30,3,76

												A really well put together strategy game. More depth to it than you first think, and battles can quickly swing the other way. You fight for territory control and resources, and harvest the land to build enough machines to stomp your enemy.			",170,40,0,20,16,0,15

												This game could be some much BETTER in 2D. Seriously. It's a nice clever turn-based board game. But all these 3D bells and whistles are hurting so much while adding... um, nothing? Sure, elevation is a game mechanic here, but it has a discrete value that could be represented by some tokens in 2D. So please, please give me a flat fast-paced version of this and I'll play it. Currect slugish 3D incarnation? No way.			",141,50,0,57,20,0,60

												Not only this is a great turn-based strategy game with a different and fun mechanic but it's also a nice analogy for humankind and what we're doing to our planet...Morality aside, the way you gather resources by slowly destroying the very map hexagons you need to stand on and/or build is genius! It opens up different ways of destroying your enemy while making you think carefully to see if you're not dooming yourself as well.			",202,84,4,16,22,2,40

												What's that old saying? ""A minute to learn, a lifetime to master""?Yep. That's Greed Corp. Anyone that likes turn-based games in that follows suit of strategic board games (Best I can compare it to would be Stratego mixed with Heroscape) would love this game. The maddening AI makes for long hours of gameplay in campaign mode, but as with most board games, the real joy is in the multiplayer. (Online and Local available.)			",240,48,10,15,29,5,27
