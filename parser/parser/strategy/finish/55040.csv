												Atom Zombie Smasher is a super little indie strategy game.  The basic premise is that you take on the guise of a commander holding back the zombie hordes from overruning your city.  It works on two levels; first is the strategy where a map of the city districts is where you see the progress of zombie infestations and plan your next mission.  You can choose which military assets you take with you from: infantry, snipers, mines, demolitions, barricades, gas attracting teams or artillery.  Once you initiate the mission, the game changes to a tactical sub-game where you place your units on the map to best protect the civilians you are trying to extract from the map, while avoiding collateral damage.  To many dead civilians and you fail.There are a number of tactical elements that affect each mission type such as: map layout, dangerous area which can explode if you are not careful, more or less time-limit & available/unavailable units.You win if you extract a minimum number of civilians or your units are able to destroy the encroaching zed hordes.  However if you do not clear the map of zeds before nightfall more zeds arrive to swarm the map.  Successful missions reward you with points that go towards an overall victory target.  Units also receive XP to increase their unique zed destroying abilities and they can level up to increase those abilites to make them more clincial.The zeds then receive strategic points allocated to some city district (1-4) which determines the strength of the zombie hordes and the difficulty of initiating a mission there.  This continues until you reach the campaign victory target.Though gameplay is fairly repetitive the addition of custom campaign options make the strategy and tactical aspects that much more varied.  Scientists can be found wondering the city area and can be rescued.  Each one can then be ""spent"" to acquire research upgrades towards 8 specific areas of interest including: faster xp gains for units, faster strategic weapons, resilient scientist, more destructive weapons etc).  You can have access to strategic and tactical weapons that can clear zeds from an entire district thus reseting the danger level there.  Just be aware of the monster-zeds! lolFor me this was a surprise gem of a game.  While graphics are just basic sprites, it really can grab you if you let it.  It one of the most intelligently designed games Ive ever played and almost perfectly balanced.  While the musical score and audio is fairly basic, they do a wonderful job of immersing you in unfolding events.  Best of all its a very polished game.   Even if some Mac users are having problems with playing it.If you are after a basic but enjoyable zombie apocalypse survival simulator then you should pick up a copy when the price is right for you!

It's called Atom Zombie Smasher. Yes, there are zombies, yes, you smash them, with atomic bombs...The title is as literal as it comes, perhaps second only to NZA 2 (read my review on -that- for more details) in terms of ""It does what it says on the tin"". Atom Zombie smasher is a variant on those old-school top down ""Zombie outbreak simulator"" programs that would show lots of little dots rushing around, some were coloured as civilians, and others as zombies, over time you'd watch the infection spread throughout the city, often leaving a small clump of survivors holed up in a dead end praying to survive just another few moments.This is the logical conclusion of that program, it's a game and a campaign structured around the outbreak simulator program, with you tasked as the last remaining commander of the available defence forces, attempting to save as many lives (and smash as many zombies) as you can. To this end you're provided with a default escape helicopter, and gradually introduced to the toolbox of mercenaries that accompany you over the course of the campaign.More than just a zombie infection simulator...The game runs two distinct ""beats"", the first is the strategic map, a somewhat procedurally generated vision of a large city with lots of sub districts. This map operates on something of a turn based mode, so at the beginning of a given month, the zombie AI places outbreak counters on various districts, you then select a district to fight in, and depending on the outcome the district is either still infested, cleared out, or reclaimed and made safe for humanity. So far so normal, it's important to note however that whilst you only get ONE district to fight each month, the outbreak AI gets two, and eventually three counters to use, you're fighting a losing battle overall.However, on the upside, you -do- get some tools at various points, in the strategic map the two major events are access to a prototype cannon (Elephantbird) that allows you to utterly eradicate a district in the tactical mode (more on this shortly), and llama bombs, which essentially decontaminate a bunch of districts in one pass, buying you much needed breathing room. Outside of this, you'll be assigned a squad of mercenaries (randomly selected from the available pool), and you'll get to choose a district to ""go tactical"" on.Getting down and dirty with the undead masses...This is where the outbreak simulator program is most visible, in the tactical mode you're presented with a moderately simple top down view, with civilians represented in a sortof beige yellow, zeds in purple, and your forces taking up various other colours. Left unchecked, the map will play out much like the software in question, and eventually all the survivors will be gobbled up, but you've tools to prevent this!Before the tactical map kicks off, you designate your initial landing point for your rescue chopper (equipped with foghorn that automatically attracts nearby civilians), and you set up your various mercenaries. These range from single shot items like minefields, to ongoing and mobile defences such as infantry and snipers. Effective use and the setting up of choke-points can, if done right, result in you demolishing all the zombies before nightfall and scoring a hefty bonus (indeed, these bonuses, and saving lots of survivors is your path to victory).We have explosive...The game really livens up once you've got explosives, with the map turning from an often pristine cityscape into a big brown muddy pit. Zombies exploding in clouds of green as your artillery rains down, remote dynamite detonations at key junctions reducing swarms of zombies into kibble, and your infantry protecting choke points and keeping the zeds away from the ever dwindling number of survivors. Once there are no more survivors to rescue, the scores are tallied up and you're returned to the strategic map. Learning how to adapt your tactics to an ever growing outbreak, and racing to the victory of humanity before the zeds inevitably take over forms the core of the campaign.Blendo hits one out of the park, with an off the wall look at zombie apocalypses...For a simple pick up and play title, it offers an excellent level of depth, combined with an offbeat and catchy soundtrack. The graphics are not much to look at, but they do the job functionally well (think of a 3D version of that outbreak simulator and you're pretty much there). It's very easy on the system requirements and provided you don't suffer any hiccups at launch, you'll have little complaint from the game. As a cheap impulse buy, it's hard to find fault and as such, comes very much recommended.Verdict : Essential ",1648,571,92,264,280,18,321

												I enjoy games with simple and intuitive designs.  Atom Zombie Smasher fits the mold.  I enjoyed the first 5 to 7 levels quite extensively.  I played them a number of times.  My children did as well.The problem is that this game is difficult.  I found myself losing over and over again after the first few levels.  I attempted multiple different strategies to no avail.  It seems like the AI (read: zombies) are just too good.  I'm not putting the game down, I just wish I could experience more of the end game content.I enjoyed the experience quite a bit and will give AZS an 8/10.If you are reading this and considering buying it, I'd say go for it.  Maybe you'll be better than me!			",114,38,2,11,10,1,43

												Good game, A shame it has never been working since it came out. Had issues getting it to run on a vista system due to audio issues, forcing it to auto close after a pop up telling me how to down load the work around. Even though when I played the demo of the game and it ran fine. YOU WILL HAVE ISSUES, you will waste your money if you buy this game and don't want to go through fourms to figure out how to get the thing working again. It's because it was a good game abandoned as soon as it come out. It is not like it was made for Xp and older, it came out Mar 14, 2011 yet it wont run Vista or Windows 7. Save your money and buy something that works when you start it up.			",212,21,1,44,47,2,61

												Atom Zombie SmasherA jewel, a polished diamond for 20-30 hours of fun. It allows for the most accesible modding and mod creation I have seen, useful for getting any  kind of experience desired, from the easiest of easy to the most insane of modes. The cleverly designed units are great for getting different challenges, thought they can sometimes end up in such a way as to make it impossible to win. There are a variety of preset options for the game, which allow you to make the game go on indefinitely, let you pick your units and so on. All in all very cleverly designed. Even when you get bored of the normal saving civiians / killing zeds, you can play Kringlejammer the most hilariously overpowered weapon of mass destruction, with a bit of strategy to see how long you can last. It is suprisingly addictive, akin to a tower defense game but with a bit of a twist. The story behind the game is also quite odd, but provides some comic relief.Worth it's price? YesGameplay time: 10 hours for basic experience, 20 for some modding and messing around, 30 for achievement completion.			",262,60,7,35,20,1,47

												It was fun while it lasted. Anyone who has looked even slightly into this game will realize something quite clear: this game may be broken for you and the issue will not be fixed. Ultimately the issue occurs for those who use an ATI GPU. So if you have be prepared to have issues playing this game.Previously I was able to play the game normally after applying some fixes and tweaks. Even though it crashed my computer a couple times it was still okay. However, I’m now at a point where it will always crash at a specific point and there’s nothing I can do to get around it this time. The feeling sunk in and then I decided to chalk up my losses at being able to play a very fun game and decided to never visit it again thus deleting it from my computer. Having spent a good chunk of time on a campaign and then seeing it get to a point where you can’t do a darn thing about it really kills it. ",205,18,2,17,12,1,31

												This is one of my all time favourite games on Steam. Basically you are managing the emergency evacuation of citizens during a zombie outbreak. You will need quick thinking and reflexes to save as many people as possible, and many people will die. You get to position weapons and squads and then give them orders to try to slow or eliminate the zombie hordes. Things will go wrong, but eventually you will get the hang of it,This game is also easily moddable to make it more challenging or more fun, however you would like to play. The music is pretty fun, and the levels are randomised to keep it fresh. There is something satisfying about pulling of a particularly good attempt on a level.This game made me a fan of Brendon Chung and I have been following him ever since. If you think you would like it, you should give it a shot.			",631,342,20,103,62,7,134

												A top down view of the Zombie Apocalypse!Great soundtrack and effects coupled with addictive gameplay make this a surprising hit for what is a basic top down 2d game with sprites.  Kind of like a tower defense game, but without a fixed base - the people you save are essentially what you are trying to protect!The Campaign map or strategic view is where you begin.  Every turn zombies (Zeds) take over new territories. From these you choose a territory/city to attempt to rescue civilians from.  This will launch your team deployment phase - placing helicopter landing point etc.Once each turn or rescue begins, you have a set number of people you have to rescue to be successful - should you fail to hit this number, you will lose that territory.  Should you succeed, it will become neutral.  Rescue during missions is achieved by clicking with the mouse to adjust landing zone for your helicopter in a way that draws the people away from the edges of the city where the Zeds emerge from.  During the daytime when rescue missions begin, this will be from marked entrances, but on sun down, more Zeds will appear from all edges of the city!!Only people within a certain radius hear the helicopters horn and move towards it - which can later be upgrade - there is a delay until the helicopter arrives and how many people it can carry which you can also be upgraded as you progress.  You unlock new units to assist you as the campaign progresses such as mobile soldier squad, fixed artillery which you can place on a rooftop, sniper team and roadblocks to name a few.The Zed get scored on how many people they 'convert' regardless of the outcome.  At the end of the mission you are returned to the main map, and scores are added up for yourself and the zed.  At set points totals fixed events occur, such as 'Giant Zeds' etc to spice things up a bit.  Also, depending upon the month/turn, Zed will invade other territories.  The ultimate aim being to out-score the zed in what is essentially a points race - for a large part of which you will be behind in until you discover 'Llama bombs' later in the game ;-)Overall it is a great little addictive strategy game, one word of warning though, it only has the one soundtrack, so if you don't like it, you may want to turn the music off altogether!

												I really enjoyed this title. got it from the Humble Blendo Bundle. Graphically there isnt much going on, but gameplay has a very large amount of options available to tweek your experience. I finished a campaign more than once - and tried to win even MORE times. Its challenging and requires thinking strategically about which zones to attempt to rescue in order to contain the outbreak. Not being able to choose what units you bring into the field with you creates another obstacle for you. But you can toggle that mechanic on or off depending on your mood. A game that you will fire up once in a while for a very long time IMO. It will always entertain you with its challenge, its simple, yet interesting presentation. I always like games where its clear the creators really put their souls into the development and polish the game up to a fine shine before release. This is clearly a labor of love. Get this game if you want to save the world from the zombie outbreak with AWESOME weapons and units. It wont be easy but i didn't even mind losing - because it seemed like you were always learning and picking up new tenchniques to try out on your next run. 7/10 GREAT game.			",372,108,15,46,32,5,73

												Great game. I played it for a long time (pre-steam) and more than got fair value out of it.My only gripe is that both sides win or lose by momentum. The few times I beat the hardest difficulty mode while on hardcore, I succeeded because I was able to win the first couple of levels--after that, the game flowed easily. If you get behind on the harder difficulties, it becomes increasingly difficult to catch up. Of course, that's probably how a zombie apocalypse would be, so...Anyway, great indie game from several years ago. If you like what can be an incredibly difficult roguelike puzzle game, get this one!			",36,12,1,27,16,0,18

												A challenging minimalistic strategy in which you recue bunch of little cube peoples before cube zombies infect them. It can be frustrating and I'm not too keen on the music, but it is quirky and I am happy it has an OST at least. It kinda mixed tower defense mechanics, but instead of protecting the base, you are just slowing down the incoming mobs so that you can escape with as many survivors as possible. I like the scoreboard mechanic, it has a board game feel to it and you compete against the AI which you will more than likely be behind for a long while at first.			",659,175,12,86,58,6,54

												While not generally a great fan of real-time strategy games, I found this one oddly addictive.  Deliberately minimalistic in-game graphics are more than compensated for with nifty cartoon asides and an awesome surf-guitar soundtrack.  What more can I say, IT WORKS!!!Verdict: 8/10.

												This game is a simple but wonderful game.You can make it as hard as you want to, or as easy as you want to.Blowing up zombies with a ton of dynamite never get old, and theres nothing quite as rewarding and completing a hard mission only seconds before nightfall comes.A great game with high abillities to customize as you want to. Totally worth the price			",235,51,1,52,30,3,52

												I just reinstalled this game and I have to say that I forgot how fun it is.  AZS is a strange amalgam of tower defense, zombie horde killing, and a puzzle game.  You manage a variety of mercenaries to control a zombie outbreak while rescuing civilians.  When things take a turn for the worse you can call in the Catbird Cannon and the trusty Llama Bombs to eradicate entire city blocks and the zeds they contain.  AZS never takes itself too seriously and that's probably my favorite thing about it.  The soundtrack is amazing, the game is super cheap, and I can't reccommend it enough.			",182,23,1,33,13,5,52

												Bought this game as a student years ago running on an old laptop of mine and have recently came back to play through it with fresh eyes. This game is amazing. It's a great strategy game which reminds me of both XCOM and Close Combat. The soundtrack is superb and once you think you've finished with the game, other players have created lots of fantastic mods which add more playtime and gameplay options. Admittedly,  the majority of them the mods make the game  easier to play through the campaigns mode.  However, there are some excellent mods out there which add new challenges,  maps, short stories and raining artillery!			",319,74,6,45,50,1,55

												This game is amazing. This is one of the best zombie games I have ever played and it's made by one man. It has a RISK like overworld in which you decided which territories to cleanse of Zed. Once the territory is selected, the game transitions into a real-time strategy game in which you must kill Zed with your mercanaries while evacuating civilians with your helicopter. It's simple, easy to learn, but endlessly entertaining. It has never stopped being fun. That 13 hours? Ignore that. I've played WAY more. There's really no reason not to get this game. It's cheap.

												Atom Zombie Smasher is a charming and quirky little game. It took me a couple of plays through to really get the hang of what I was doing, and I finally beat the game (default settings) on my third time through the campaign.The're not a lot of variety in the gameplay, though. Once you're familiar with the various units and the way the game plays out, there's not much more to keep you playing. After about 10 hours, I had beat the game, and was ready to be done. But I really enjoyed that first 10 hours.			",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												Atom Zombie Smasher was one of the more addicting experiences I have had in awhile. Each mission was intense and more than not, brought you to the brink of barely surviving.The gameplay mechanics are solid, and your selection of power ups are your saving grace in most cases, though I found the basic setup strategy to still be key. Many missions however felt as though there wasn't a lot of room for experimentation on your strategy, but rather one particular set of placements would be the only route. This may have just been a personal experience, but it was observed anyhow.My only complaint, or maybe this was intention, so instead should be a compliment was the Over Map and the constant ""Won the battle, losing the war"" feeling you got. It was incredibly difficult to determine which event to tackle next as you always knew that even if that battle was won, the odds were stacked against you overall on your return back to the over-map.I would still recommend giving this a go if you're a hardcore strategy fan. Although the graphics and presentation aren't awe-inspiring, the atmosphere and stylization work for this game.That coupled with solid mechanics make this a good title to round out your Steam Library.

												So in this game, you are defending a country from zombies...I think?  Or maybe it has to do with politics.  It's a game where the basics revolve around saving civilians and stopping zombies from overwhelming parts of the map (each is its own specific encounter).  Interwoven in this gameplay is a borderline incomprehensible plot involving llama-bombs and all sorts of madness.  A cool game to try out for a weird experience.			",303,65,3,23,24,4,39

												I logged a few hours of gameplay a long time ago, at which point I decided that I didn't care for the game and uninstalled. Just recently I was browsing my games library and came across this one. I remembered that it left a bad impression, but I couldn't remember what specifically turned me off after just 2 or 3 hours of time with the game, so I decided to re-install it. It wouldn't start, so I headed over to the discussions to see if I could find a solution, and apparently the game just doesn't start anymore for several people, and that there's a very low likelihood of a fix coming anytime soon.Not recommended for anyone until a fix comes along. Even then, I might still recommend against it. I did stop playing the first time because of bad impressions, after-all. Even if I don't remember what they were.			",252,57,1,41,19,2,38

												This game is incredible, and I should've remembered to review it years ago.  Well-designed RTT and RTS packaged up into a tiny, pulp fiction universe that's experiencing an enormous problem with the undead.  Command a shifting roster of -unusual- mercenary squads and specialist military units amidst the chaos of the zombie apocalypse.Supervise evacuation efforts, last-ditch defenses and all-out offensives against the surging tides of death.  As the pressure mounts, rescue wonky scientists and ""ask"" them to research improvements for your equipment.  Set up elaborate traps and killzones across entire downtown areas, employing mercenaries, snipers, explosives and other, more exotic weapons.  Use the zombies' behaviors against them, until desperation leads to the utilization of unlucky civilians as bait in your tactical plans.  When all else fails and the cities are alive with corpses, feel free to resort to nuclear warfare and llama bombs.A pitch-perfect example of clever indie design and a willingness to make immensely creative games on a shoestring.  AZS is well-built on a foundation of intriguing swarm AI, hilarious art and slick, intuitive gameplay.  Take the plunge if you enjoy RTS, strategy or puzzle games; Atom Zombie Smasher won't disappoint.			",94,30,1,9,37,0,37

												Fun game, you kill little pixel zombies and save little pixel people, or at least that's how I remember it. Sadly, I can't currently recommend the game as it just fails to load(No idea why as there was previously no problems). First issue I had, was a missing .dll, not a problem, just copied it over from windows. Except, it just led on to another error, failed to initialise MONO, not a problem, just delete a .dll. Of course, that didn't actually do anything, so the game still fails to load and my final option was to run it via XP compatibility, which gave me a blue screen crash(first time ever on this PC) so I immediately uninstalled the game.Shame, it really was fun when it worked.

												Before this review gets underway, I have to share my extreme bias - I have a boner for this game. This is fun in a way I didn't expect when I first played it. My initial impression was that it was just simplistic and I didn't really get the nuances, but that changed after a few missions. The top down map per-mission is like a puzzle unto itself, and you need to take care of how you protect/secrifice alleyways and streets. Your upgrades will make or break your game, and there will be some missions where things are just totally against you, and you will lose more than a fair share of civilians. But you'll keep going back at it because this game's strategy is just too fun. It runs on any system short of a 95' Mac, and as you go, the upgrades start getting crazy with the amount of building damage you can do.Not going to sugar coat it here, this game is great if you like tactical games, and has infinite replayability. It's worth every penny and more. Do yourself a favour, and join me in boner-world.			",175,27,1,17,14,0,14

												First a massive disclaimer: Install and run this immediately, then be prepared to use the steam refund system if it crashes or fails to run. This game is essentially abandoned by the developer, who has done nothing to update or fix the game. I personally advise you only buy this game if you have windows 7 home, because 7 home is the only version I have been able to get the game to run on.That being said, I do have a functioning copy, on an older laptop running windows 7 home, with integrated Intel graphics.Gameplay consists of having zombies enter a destructible city map from multiple locations along city streets. You will have a preparation phase, during which you can put down units, barriers and equipment. Your unit availability will change from month to month, adding to the challenge of planning for the defensive. Once into the action mode, you will be able to slow down game speed using spacebar, and move units, call in artillery strikes, as well as move helicopter extraction. The zombies and civilians will respond to each other accordingly, with zombies moving towards civilians if within range, or otherwise wandering aimlessly, while civilians will remain in place unless driven away by zombies, or attracted by the extraction helicopter. Manipulating civilian movement will manipulate zombie movement in response. After each map you will have successfully saved civilians counted towards your score, and infections counted to the zombie score. After this you will receive further points based on areas controlled, and areas infected for zombies, which is followed by selecting the next area to assault. In the end this game is worth playing, and a value for people who enjoy combat tactics simulators that are somewhat more forgiving. It can be frustrating at times when civilians respond in moronic ways, but then some people are just morons and thus it is an accurate simulation unintentionally. But if you cannot get the game to run on your rig, then do not hesitate to refund, since the developer should have fixed that issue a long time ago, especially if they want to keep getting revenue from sales.

												A solid puzzle game set in a fantastic, absurdist, zombie-infested 1960's Mexico, Atom Zombie Smasher tasks you with rescuing as many survivors as you can from undead ravaged cities while arranging your mercenary forces to slay every infected SOB in sight. While the game and its many challenge modes is addictive enough, you're also graced with fragmented glimpses of a delightfully insane zombie horror plot in the background. You never actually get any coherent storyline, but there's something beautiful in the bits and pieces you collect. A cheap and wonderful way to waste a weekend if you enjoy efficient tactical placement/gonzo alt history comic books/putting the unholy dead to rest.			",378,151,4,79,48,3,74

												Ridiculously fun and addicting once you get into it. The graphics are really simple. Gameplay is easy to pick up but there's a lot of strategizing involved. There's a good amount of flexibility in choosing how the game pans out (such as difficulty, whether you can pick and choose your units, upgrades). It's fun but it can get repetitive after a while. It's the type of game you can come back and start playing it again at any time for a few rounds though.There are also mods to spice it up too.			",115,36,1,17,9,2,21

												Atom Zombie Smasher is a game set in the ficticious South Americian-esque country of Neuvos Aires and pits you as it's leader fending off a zombie infestation. Some of the screenshots made the game look a bit like a grand strategy game, a genre that never really interested me but I picked it up on a sale regardless. The general premise of the game is that you are given a squad of mercenaries and you go from region to region evacuating survivors. The types of mercenaries vary in their abilities. Throughout the missions your mercenaries gain experience based on their performance (which will be largely dependent on the player's effective utilization of them). The mercenaries that are available per mission vary and which ones are unavailable are at the discretion of the game. This might offput some, but this I felt really added a lot and required the player to use the resources made available in the most strategic way. For me it made it an interesting gaming experience as it required me to think what would be the most strategic action given the resources I was alloted. If players don't like this, there is an option to allow the player to pick the available mercenaries. Overall I was highly impressed with this game. This game supports the use of a USB controller and local coop, however local coop is simply the single player game with an additional person performing actions.  There is absolutely no change to the game itself besides having a second cursor on the screen. This game also supports modding and it's all nicely built into the game options. Modding is pretty simple though and is basically just creating a configuration file to tweak behavior and attributes.One way this game falls short is that difficulty doesn't scale in extended games. I played an extended match and at a certain point it became far too easy. The standard length matches felt a little too short for me, but it seems that the extended matches were thrown in as an afterthought and not given much attention in terms of gameplay balance and pacing goes.Score: 8.5/10			",509,60,3,44,29,0,78

												2011 was an amazing year for PC games. Sadly, this means a few great titles have been overlooked amidst the flurry of releases. Atom Zombie Smasher is the best of them. Developer Brandon Chung has always been a master of style - even his student game Barista 2 has more spunk than most commercial releases - and in Atom Zombie Smasher that style really meshes with the gameplay. The randomly-selected narrative vignettes are amusing, but this is a game that tells its story almost entirely through its gameplay. This is a real, horrifying zombie apocalypse, viewed with a clinical distance. You will try and save Nuevo Aires. You will lose. And you'll enjoy it all the way.			",462,251,7,92,60,7,83

												Wow, this game was really cool. It reminded me of The Last Guy, a game where you have to rescue people from zombies as well. Except this game is a bit more deeper with an 'overrun' system, and the fact that you have several upgradeable items and teams at your disposal, which adds a certain strategy aspect to the game. The objective is to rescue as many people as you can, by using a helicopter and the previously mentioned items and teams. It can get pretty hectic, but it's so much fun. The graphics are ok, definitely not bad, but people are shown as squares so if you're looking for realism try and find some other zombie games that do a better job.

You are fighting to push back the zombie hordes, preventing them from completely overtaking your country. Sometimes winning an easy battle is detrimental to the overall war if it means letting the zeds go unchecked elsewhere.I have yet to actually finish a complete game of this, but it is charming and very original.

												Atom Zombie Smasher is a fun real-time strategy / tactical game where you defend cities from zombies hoping to survive the apocalypse. It has great style and enough variations between potential troops and campaign options. There is one downside: The game has trouble maintaining a difficulty curve. If you get ahead early, you can usually cruise to victory. If you get a little behind, it can be really hard to catch up. That said, it's a fun $10 game that you can sink way too many hours into.

Place blockades, assign rooftop sniper teams their targets, deploy artillery and away you go!This game is wicked fun but can be frusterating at times but it's a really good deal, considering it's price.One word of warning, though: I use Windows 7, and occassionally the game causes my whole system to freeze at random times.

												A really fun game with some minimalist design. I’ve never been so afraid of an onslaught of pink dots. You have to place a small selection of units and obstacles on the map in order to wipe out the invading zombies or, in most cases, just try and evacuate as many survivors as possible. There are some fun little tactics you can use, such as routeing the zombies towards your sniper or clustering them together for a well times artillery shot. A meta-game has you and the zombies battle for territory, lets you access new units and upgrade existing ones.  Success does rather rely on you having a good start, but thankfully defeat by an unstoppable army of mega zombies is a rather good way to go.  ",669,204,30,92,73,10,138

												Atom Zombie Smasher is a pretty cool little game. There's not a lot to it - position your anti-zombie teams in a city and let them fight off the hoards under your direction while trying to give civilians safe passage to the rescue helicopter; I guess you'd say it's a tactical puzzler. Graphically this game is very basic, but it's a hulluva lot of fun! I should say however that I think this game would be better suited to being on a mobile platform as it looks like just the sort of thing that a phone could handle, while providing a certain type of addictive gameplay that keeps you coming back. Despite that feeling I must say that I still got more than my moneys worth out of playing it - 6 out of 10, would smash.			",507,128,7,26,23,2,37

												This is a really good game, and I don't say that lightly.  I'm not sure how I acquired this game, it likely came from a Humble Bundle or some other type of deal.  I don't usually even consider top-down indie games because so many of them are poorly done.  This is a great game.The setting is simple, you are the government controlling troops in a Latin-america zombie apocalypse.  A very interesting settings since so much of zombie media is based in the USA.  The tools of war are not overly complicated and yet the strategy is pure and advanced.  As far as indie games go these graphics are good – granted its not really even 3d but everything is animated well.  The music is very good, its fun Latino music, but not overly brash for someone who normally dislikes that kind of music.This is game is very good value for money because you could replay it over and over.  Even though its not a tower defense game I think this title appeals to the same sort of crowd.  I just wish I could get this on Android as I would pay $10 to get it on my phone.  The game even has a “netbook” mode for low-end machines, so I think its reasonable to think that my quad-core snap dragon could run it.			",243,61,11,29,32,0,23

Your job is to clear out and secure zones to protect citizens of Buenos Aires. The game is just laughably absurd story-wise with amusing little interludes in the form of comic strips all the while you deal with research and the constantly rotating availability of units under your command.Cheap, fun, unique, Blendo Games provides an easy-to-learn, hard-to-master strategy game that involves Zombies, saving people, and dead-pan humor. Even better is that despite what it looks like, the game's developer did almost all of the work himself which is also a plus.Mods are possible, and in fact easy to do as INIs are actually shared through Steam as well in-game. Find a mod you want, download and execute it. Different experiences from the original design is just two seconds away.			",655,134,32,120,86,3,104

I've heard AMD users blue screen and I personally had an error relating to a corrupt or missing sound file that wouldn't let me launch the game. To get around this I simply specified launch command to play the game with no sound. So while my experience was very....quiet, the gameplay itself is fantastic and certainly worth the money. If you actually want sound there are fixes for the particular bug I had that also give you sound but I was too lazy to bother with downloading files. Basically do your research on the forums on this game before buying to see if you can run it. If you can, highly recommended.			",106,12,0,20,27,0,25

												Excellent zombie-killing strategy game with Tower Defense elements. The core of the gameplay is to rescue as many civilians as possible out of a city being run over by zombies. You have a variety of units at your disposal, and after every round you get another unit. Which unit you get is randomized from playthrough to playthrough making each playthrough feel unique. You also have access to upgrades for your units between missions.The only caveat is that the game won't run on modern operating systems, so if you are running Windows 10 (some people are reporting issues on 8.1 as well, but I can neither confirm or disprove those claims) you are♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck. If you are still back on Windows 7 and enjoy strategy games or tower defense, definitely give this game a♥♥♥♥♥♥			",225,71,4,46,22,5,39

												This game is pretty fun, if played in short spurts. It's quite simple to grab, and hard to master, since you have to think through your choices before commiting to something, or risk getting zombies overrunning a lot of areas, both in the city and on the zone map.Saw a lot of people complaining about the game, but it does seem to be a Windows 10 issue, since I'm using 8.1, and all it asked me was to download a file from the dev's website, which a did, installed, and the game booted with no issues.So, I guess that if you have Win 10, stay away from it, if you got other Windows versions, go for it!Not sure why anyone would install Win 10 anyway...

												TL;DR Score: 7.5/10Quick Review: great game to pickup-and-play quickly with some great humor in there, good skills and varying troops, challanging but not boring-repeat style, very good ""save the citizens"" with artilary and troop deployment game.Pros:» Quick and easy to learn.» Good humor and easter eggs.» Tons of replayability, with ability to change settings of gameworld.» A good amount of varying troops to deploy, alongside your main gun.» challanging ""fights"" to play, but easily restartable if you mess up.Cons:» Not much in terms of graphics, top-down style with pixels. (not including the art in cutscenes)» Can, very rarly, get frustrating.» no control over where citizens go, sometimes being unpredictable and walking into a zombie.Main Review: A bit of a shot-in-the-dark game, but i got it in a humble bundle sale (which i support for the charity :D) but it is quite good, a nice take on the zombie appocalypse with trying to save citizens and reaching you're goal before the zombies get too big in numbers. Loads of different versions of troops and they are also upgradable! Your able to also redirect the zombies (with citizens or blocking off pathways) and the map is mostly destrucable. it has been a while since i played it, but i just remember good times along with the good humor and cutscenes which include easter eggs.Any Updated Review:			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Atom Zombie Smasher is a fairly simple arcade game. The game has many customization options, good balancing for high to low skill levels. It seems to work even on laptops. Pretty much what you see is what you get and if you're okay with that, it's a good game.It's nice to slaughter zombies while listening to Hawaii themed music. Nicola Tesla is not included though.

I tend to be a sucker for zombie anything (as a lot of people are), but this game was admittedly different from any other zombie game that I've ever played. It's top-down epidemic spreading goodness, as you try to obliterate the zombies and get survivors onto helicopters. Execution is good, gameplay is good, and the humor is good.And the music. Oh, God. The music. So good.So go out and buy this game, okay? Good, good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I can pick it up and play it here and there for just a few games, but like a flash game, it's really only engaging for a short chunk of time.At this point I'm sure you can pick it up for next to nothing, and I'd say it would be worth it for the times when bigger game titles are in a dry spell.

												One of the best small-stratagy-games. I've been playing it from time to time for about last 3 years (actually I've bought it during one of Humble Bundle sales and played a lot outside of steam).The game is pure tactics stratagy, without some economics features. All you need is plan your operations, upgrade units' skills and replay a lot, untill you're able to finish a level almost perfectly.I don't know why some reviewers say that this game is ""completly random blah-blah-blah"", I can't find anything like that. I would hazard a guess, that they are just not good enough in hard-core tactics games. Let's say, if you don't know what it is to use quick-save a lot in X-COM (turn based stratagy series (the old one and the new one)), in Fallout 2, in Jugger Alliance, you might dislike Atom Zombie Smasher for its ""hardcoreness"", but if you like those games, well, I guess AZS is for you.

OK!Random choices whats available and what not, leaving you with sometimes absurd combinations of units? No thanksOtherwise quite good and fun.			",71,4,0,6,7,1,16

												This is one of those games that's been sitting in my Library for maybe years and I never touched. Until I did. It's very dynamic, semi-twitch gameplay and strategic above all. You need to plan and manage your resources both short term and long term to win the campaign. Lots of variety, lots of replay value and great music. Definitely worth a look.			",286,124,4,44,27,4,28

												Atom Zombie Smasher is a quirky, peculiar, entertaining indie strategy game. The premise is that of a spreading zombie apocalypse, where your job is to evacuate and protect all civilians in the surrounding districts from the approaching infected. The game's interesting gameplay of placing specific units in specific places and herding civilians onto helicopters to escape offers a unique experience that's hard to forget when you couple it with the game's interesting design choices. For as affordable as it is, if you're looking for a game that'll exercise your brain and give many hours of fun, this is what you're looking for.			",84,9,0,7,5,0,14

												Fantastic 2d planar game about fashioning a defense against a zombie invasion in Chile. With great atmosphere, beautiful illustrations and well-written dialogue/background and a great set of mechanics to boot, this game is a fantastic little indie title that deserves a look. I didn't think I would love this game and then I started playing. I think they should have ported this game somehow to ios on Ipads to increase exposure and conversation about this more than worthwhile endeavor. <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												**EDITED**I intially gave this a big NO due to a common error which I have fixed via Blendo games and can once again play this game. So based on this I feel it only fair to offer a better review.Where to start.For one this , for me, is a stupidly addictive little game. You basically have to evacuate cities of survivors using your evac helicopter and various Mercs (which you unlock along the way). Sometimes you get lucky other playthroughs you get screwed trying to clear a heavily infected city with just barricades and dynamite. The game also offers a beautiful sense of ""I'm kicking Zed butt and totaly own this game"" and then turns the screw as you see the map atart to swarn with high level infected cites, more zed, exploding gas lines and the MEGA zed's.Graphics are basic but work fine with the genre of game.I love the music/soundtrack (kind of a 60's surf music feel).The vignettes/story boards make no sense (which a lot of people have criticised) and are completely odd at times but this adds to the charm. There is alot of screaming at survivors as you near your target and they all run in the opposite direction straight into a zombie hoard.Bags of replay value due to the mods and game modes availible. I have lost many hours trying new tactics, almost winning, rage quittting, starting a new game and repeat.It's a great time killer and worth a look at once you can fix the audio error (as stated the is a fix if you look).

												This is a very fun game and can become addicting. Has in game custom campaign modifers you can select or a host of user made mods to spice things up. Has straight forward moding you just need to know a slight big about editig ini fiels.Gameplay is pretty simple and yet still has a lot of stragey to it.You have to evac survivors that are in zombie infested cities. Might sound simple but when the various elements come into play you find out otherwise. Arty,mines,remote dynimate,zombie bait,snipers,troopers.Each plays uniquely  and are upgradable based on exp points which add to the depht.This game has enough content to keep you play for a short  or long games.Also has local co-op			",381,74,14,73,45,5,92

												A very enjoyable tactical game,The main goal is to gather enough points from saving X number of people in cities that has a outbreak as well as this you can also hire mercs to combat the zombies as simple as it sounds it isn't since over time you get more than one outbreak at a time and for every victem of the zombie equals a point towards them.as i said at first this game is very enjoyable in a tactical view, those who don't like planning and thinking ahead in their games should avoid this, But those who love taking tactical decision or deciding wether to save as many civvies or combat the zombies off the area fully to capture that city, will enjoy this game.Not only is it a Indie game, it also a cheap and easily modable game.

												This game is good.Your first play you will try to save the civs and kill the zombies. simple right? welll.If zombies kill a civ they get a point where as every civ you take out via air you get a point.If you kill all zombie on board before night fall you get credit for saving all civs that were not killed by zombies. Sorta simple right...buttt...Soon after playing you will find out killing civs does nothing to you but will make it so they can not die from zombies..yes that right no point loss...So after a while of playing this you will start killing of parts of the civilan population so they do not get killed by zombies....because your helping...So as long as you kill all zombies at any cost before the timer for night time goes to 0 AND make sure that the zombies do not kill a civ you will get credit for saving all of them even if you kill most.I usally use the air lift as a becon for the civs to gather then drop artiliry on them while they wait for the lift....why...because sometimes civilan death is a part of war...i am the good guy here...by killing them all they can not become zombies...Math is sorta in favor of you killing civs to save them but still a fun game.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a casual Strategy action game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can play the game with your local friend (if you have any). But you need a controller to do so.There are some different resolution sizes available.There is a music slidebar available.There is a sound slidebar available.You are able to toggle between fullscreen or windowed mode.There is color blind mode option available.About the game.This is more like a ""Risk"" kind of game, You have to control zones and the more zones you own, the more points you get, more points you get - you will win.Sometimes you have to play as a helicopter. You have to save as much scientists and people as you can. During missions. Your units will be able to level up if they are able to do their job. Like helicopter needs to rescue people to level up, As military units require kills to level up.The game is pretty fun and relaxing.Could be repetitive.Is moddable.Has some other mode aswell.You can set your own rules and play how you want to play.Has perma-death if toggled.Other things.You will have more fun with co-op. As they are able to control different units.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			",467,171,6,45,49,1,62

												Gameplay revolves around protecting an overworld map from zombie infestations. You pick out regions to evacuate and send in troops/artillery/explosives to fight off the zombies while your chopper air-lifts civilians and scientists (for researching upgrades). It gets repetitive because each zone is randomly generated, even if you restart the current mission. However there is no way to preview what the map will look like when you choose to evac it; besides a general difficulty number, there's no sure way to prepare your loadout. This leads to occasionally forfeiting a zone and losing a turn, potentially costing you the whole campaign. Some replay value is provided by mutators which affect everything from possible loadouts to super weapon strengths.I got this in the humble indie bundle 3 and find it very entertaining in small doses. Worth checking out if you're looking for a twist on tower defense games.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

It gets repetitive because each zone is randomly generated, even if you restart the current mission. However there is no way to preview what the map will look like when you choose to evac it; besides a general difficulty number, there's no sure way to prepare your loadout. This leads to occasionally forfeiting a zone and losing a turn, potentially costing you the whole campaign. Some replay value is provided by mutators which affect everything from possible loadouts to super weapon strengths.I got this in the humble indie bundle 3 and find it very entertaining in small doses. Worth checking out if you're looking for a twist on tower defense games.			",453,130,4,80,30,2,106

												I cannot play or get this game refunded. There is an issue when the game tries to load, it stops and crashes. I've followed the suggested help for this issue and it still has not allowed me to play. Therefore, I am leaving negative feedback about this game because my experience has been pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.I'll happily remove this review should you decide to give me my money back. Not fair to rate a game I didn't get to play, also not fair to keep my monies.			",55,5,0,3,1,0,6

												In short:What you won't found here is pretty graphics or voice acting or deep story. Also it does have steep learning curve and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI for the civilians that will run into the zombies in an attempt to run from them(WTF). For some reason they run to their death faster than they run to their rescue.On the plus side: it's a sorta-roguelike, real time tactics (with planning phase just before the onslaught begins) funny game with minimalistic graphics about surviving a zombie infestation. Also HIGHLY MODDABLE which is great. The intersting mechanics: each side has it own milestones to achieve and the first side to reach the goal points wins. Some encounters are more defensive (rescue and not really returning fire) and some are all about destroying the other side. It depends on the resources at hand (mostly available mercs), the encounter modifier, the current situation and of course on the player itself.Can't say I'd recommend it to everyone but for 3$ (when on sale) is at least worth checking out. If the trailer for the game doesn't scare you and you like moddable roguelikes (= high replayability) it is well worth the 10$.			",1009,420,31,129,109,13,168

												The brand of near-impossible challenge this game offers is not to my taste. There is undoubtedly a way to beat it, but several things I prefer to have direct control over are never in the player's hands to begin with.Atom Zombie Smasher focues on rescueing civilians from zones infested with zombies. You have no control over the civilians on the ground; you can only send an evacuation helicoptor and hope all the civilians get to it in time. In order to aid you in this mission, you are given control of a random set of resources.These resources are randomized for every mission, and it is this aspect to the game that I cannot stand. Sometimes you'll have access to attack dogs and snipers, other times you'll have mines and blockades. Rarely, all you'll have access to is blockades and a paltry 3 bombs with which to stem the zombie tide. Even worse, the challenges you'll face vary from times of day (fewer zombies in sunshine, etc) to superzombies that require a considerable effort to take down.Every zone you lose to the zombies gets chalked up on a big scoreboard. First to a set score wins, and it's an uphill battle for any player from the start. If I had control over my resources, I might enjoy this. However, I don't so I can't.			",536,96,7,62,32,4,88

												The fact that this game is still for sale on Steam is ridiculous.  It's been unplayable for the vast majority of people for a very long time.  RUN AWAY FROM THIS GAME AS FAST AS YOU CAN.Instead of fixing the game to a playable state, the ""developer"" chose to build another game and has ignored previous customers for well over a year, probably more as I stopped counting.Disgusted it's still for sale here on Steam, and they should be ashamed for duping people by selling it.Still not sure?  Check out the discussion pages and community for the game.If you need to spend some money, go buy a coffee and donut instead.  At least you'll get something for your cash.			",23,2,1,1,7,1,12

												Giving this game a bad review just because OS's have outgrown it is sort of like saying your bed is a crap bed because you've outgrown it. For people that can play this game; it's a solid game, great mechanics, fun to place what is essentially World War Z. Sadly not being worked on anymore but as I said, folks with updated OS's have probably stated this enough to make that clear. Anyway, I had fun and you will too.(Edit Note: Oh yes, give me your un-helpful review scores. I taste the anger of Windows 10.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Who remembers this one? Back from the olden days of Winter Sale coal and fresh indie zombie games. Actually, maybe it's more appropriate to ask if you remember that decade-old zombie simulator with the colored dots, because this is the fully gameified version of that. Humanity is on the retreat from the zombie hordes and it's up to you to evacuate the survivors from your region. You can select different infested areas from the strategic map based on the infection level (difficulty), and it takes you to a small city map where you have to plan the evacuation. You get a helicopter that airlifts folks (yellow dots) out every 20 seconds or so, and up to 3 mercenary units to help defend. These units are anything from soldiers and snipers to landmines and barricades. After each mission you AND the zombies get victory points based on the final number of survivors and zombies. New events occur as you both reach certain victory point milestones, and the first side to rack up the target number of points wins.Sounds solid, right? Unfortunately, this all comes together to form a strategy game that's mostly based on random chance. Just like the old simulator, humans turn into zombies instantly when touched, and you better believe the survivors clump up around the landing zones like delicious stuffing. All it takes is one zombie escaping your best-laid deathtrap to ruin an entire map. This is further exacerbated by the fact that your 3 mercenary units are randomized for each mission. So while you're in good shape if you get your mortars and zombie baits in one mission, you're boned if you get stuck with barricades, mines, and bombs, all of which are one-use tricks. There's also random variance in the performance of your units; soldiers can miss, and your mortars can go off-target, ruining that hail mary shot you needed to save the day. There are a host of other frustrations, like how you and the zombies get points for holding territory, but you only claim territory if you kill ALL the zombies on the map before sundown, which is ludicrously difficult even if you have the right mercs for it.It's a shame, too, because the presentation is stylish and weird, and there are some neat systems to explore like XP to improve your mercs and rescuing scientists to upgrade your other abilities. The story vignettes are compellingly strange as well and I still can't make heads or tails of the story, but I know Tesla and an antichrist baby are involved. Shame I'll never figure it out, because the game's just too damn discouraging and frustrating to get through.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Decent little stetegy game. Don't be suprised if you fall behind. But no fear, there are mechanics in place to help you out.There will be times you will be at a stalemte with all level 4 zones and can't seem to take any. But that's what Llama bombs and elephantine guns are for. They will help get you rolling again.Probably the one frustrating item is the loadouts it gives you in missions. By default, these are random. Sometimes it will give you total junk and there's no way to complete the mission. This -can- be changed by certain settings. But really not a big deal.

												Nifty and simple strategy game. Reminds me quite a bit of this java zombie simulator thing I saw several years ago. For all I know it's by the same guy. Probably not though. In any  case it's a well written game. There is no huge level of depth to it in terms of plot but it's interesting and the tracks are great. I would strongly recommend waiting for this to show up in the next humble bundle or on sale. I can't compliment the game and the author's competency enough but in its present state $6 would be a better price point. It's not a matter of quality that is at issue, but the proportion of price and the scale of the game compared to others of its type. So don't let my pricing critique make it seem like the game is not worth getting, it definitely is. Just not at the present price. I did a full playthrough of it here (including a compilation of all the bonus clips).			",212,50,0,19,13,1,17

												Strange game, this one has you using strategy of placing units on the map, for some reason though half the units will randomly go on away missions, not sure what their doing but it seems their doing everything except help us wipe out the zombie apocalypse.  This strange and random gameplay mechanic means the game isnt really about strategic planning except dealing with whatever random units are available, rather strange and not fun at all.Rating:  1/10  Value:  $0.99			",2655,1122,101,267,367,29,398

												Awesome little game. Campaigns play out over the course of an hour or two in a series of battles for control of the city. Players are challenged by the mechanics of the game to always try new strategies and plan the location of each battle wisely. Some missions have more emphasis on rescuing survivors of the zed apocalypse with finesse and skill, others are just all out carnage as orbital weaponry, ground based artillery, small arms fire and the odd gas leak combine to create enough mayhem to keep you on the edge of your seat right until the end.It's the kind of game that you'll notice yourself getting better at the more you play it. The game is much more satisfying when you get the hang of it, so stick with it for a few hours before you pass judgement. Oh, and the demo is hopeless, so best just whack down your tenner if this looks like your cup of tea.8/10 ",170,26,9,33,58,9,54

												Atom Zombie Smasher is like, gives you a big world map with an objective to reach before the zombies do and then random almost everything (missions, rewards, missing mercenaries, short stories of something idk, bonus and penalty), it even has no plot. So if you're kind of gamer who don't care about plot and want a game with challenging gameplay (because almost everything is random), you might enjoy this game, but I must warn, this game also require lots of strategy gaming skills (quick eyes, fast hand, perception etc.), so if you're suck at this kind of game don't bother buying it, I'm serious, don't buy it.

What I like best is it gives you a random squad each round and you have to determine whether or not to fight low level zeds or high level zeds, but if you try and fight high level zeds with a bad squad you may screw yourself over!Overall a great fun game with high re-playability. 7/10			",357,93,2,27,25,4,31

												Interesting game it involves smashing zombies and saving civilians. different teams of government units set of snipers, artillery etc.The price is a bit steep for what you get in terms of game mechanics, but I guess people gotta eat. :PAs the game goes on the urgency and peril as more and more sections getting infested and it's your job to try and clear out zones before they get to a point of no return where the whole map gets overwhelmed.

												Atom Zombie Smasher's board game feel and zombie theming manage to not feel played out despite the current overuse of zombies in the media.

The units you use and how you choose to use them doesn't feel as ""linear"" and expected as in most tower defense games and the perks you unlock as you ""level up"" a unit can really fit almost any person's particular play style.

												Great fun, but could easily be hit-and-miss as to whether you'd like the game. It's a clever strategy game, different every time you play - sometimes frustratingly so, where you're set up with cities and a run of mercenaries which won't possibly let you out-pace the zombies in ""score"" - but this just encourages you to play again and hone your strategies. Check out the trailer or try the demo if you think it might tickle your fancy.			",524,203,30,91,63,5,136

The work ethic and attention to detail that produced such a balanced and well thought-out game leave me looking forward to his next projects.AZS is the perfect blend of action and strategy game if you are looking to spend under two hours for a complete campaign, or just five minutes to work through a single city.The replay value of this game is great.  I picked it up when it was part of the Humble Bundle and I still play it years later.  I still cannot beat a campaign set to 20000 with No Quarter selected.  Someday...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a lot more fun and exciting than videos and screenshots can convey. It's a strategy game that somehow manages to be simple, complex, and captivating all at once.It has an overworld map sort of like the board game Risk.  Selecting a zone on the overworld starts a real-time strategy mode where you try to rescue civilians and kill zombies before nightfall (usually about a minute or two).  The difficulty is variable depending on what units you have available during the missions, but there's plenty of options to reconfigure the game to your liking.There's a demo, so give it a try and see for yourself.This game is frequently packaged with other indie games, so keep an eye out for bundles and get even more for your money!

												I would give Atom Zombie Smasher a 6/10. It is a bird's eye view zombie evacuation game, with qualities of a tower defense game.Your goal is to evacuate citizens from various citeis of a country during a zombie outbreak. The more citizens you save, the higher your score and the more upgrades you can unlock. You have multiple weapons and tools available at your disposal to use, though these are randomly assigned to you. This is because, in my eyes, you have an entire country to defend and evacuate, as the zombies spread at an alarming rate (go figure: they are zombies) and the situation can quickly turn very bad.I found the game to be very strategic in certain instances, and less so in others. This winds up being the best strength and worst weakness of the game at the same time. When given random sets of gear, sometimes you are underpowered and stand little hope, sometimes you are given overpowered ones and it is too easy (you can sometimes have a weapon set that lets you airstrike the entire city, once you upgrade them enough: how fun and challenging), and sometimes you have a set where it is possible to succeed, but forces you to think, plan, and change tactics mid game. This is when it is at its most fun.You are able to set up a customized game if you wish, to add further challenge and some replayability. In the end though, Atom Zombie Shasher is not a long term game. It is one to play for a bit, then uninstall, then come back to on occasion once you are itching to try again. I recommend this game as long as you know are aware of that fact. Atom Zombie Smasher has a very limited way to play it, but it sure is fun for the first few times you do it. Approaching the situation as if you were actually evacuating cities from a zombie outbreak is pretty fun, and you definitely can't save everyone which adds an element of realism to a very goofy game. Don't expect to play it for 20+ hours or anything, but as a once in a while game it does its job very well. If you can find it in a humble bundle or on sale for a buck or two, it is definitely worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The beauty of this game is hard to see at face value, but for someone who has grown tired of games about zombies, this one is still interesting. It's interesting because you will lose. Often. It shows how dismal the idea of a zombie outbreak really is, and how difficult it would be to try and save a city from it.So rather than FPS your way through hordes, you now must tactically decide how to evacuate while still keeping all the zombies at bay.I will admit that the game is a little difficult to get into at first, but once you understand how to play, you won't give up until you've finally managed to win a game. Just expect to lose a lot in the mean time.			",332,113,4,35,41,5,61

												Challenging.  It took me a while to beat this one.  There's what I call a ""tipping point"" to this game where you will know whether you can win the game or not.  If you're not doing well, you'll know after a few levels that there is no way to come back from the deficit. A few times, I made it halfway through to only realize I would probably lose at the end...very frustrating. You need points and to do well to gain experience for your troops, more experience means your troops will perform better which will be key to winning. If you just happend to skate by each level, that won't be enough to dominate.  Anyway, I didn't like this game at first, but got into it to earn the achievements.  It's a very simple game, but done well. Atom Zombie Smashers would work well as an app on an ipad or kindle or some sort of tablet.  I created a mod which was fun. Music and sound effects were good. Overall 6.5/10			",131,49,8,27,9,2,14

												Mind - it's been about four months since I last played this game. That noted, I highly recommend it, at least when it's on sale.The game is fun, unique and has an interesting (if not limited) plot. It also has a fairly well developed interface and it can be challenging without being frustrating. It also has a lot of replay value.Unfortunately, it can get repetitive and I feel that it could use more to ""do"", as after a certain point you're just doing the same thing over and over with little to up the difficulty or change game play. It can also walk a fine line between ""way too short and easy"" and ""tiringly long and boring"", depending on what features you choose to enable or disable from the start. I've also begun to run into a few glitches (crashes), which make playing it challenging.Still, it's fun and unique, and that makes it a good deal better than most of the content you find.Over all:7/10.

												Atom Zombie Smasher is like, gives you a big world map with an objective to reach before the zombies do and then random almost everything (missions, rewards, missing mercenaries, short stories of something idk, bonus and penalty), it even has no plot. So if you're kind of gamer who don't care about plot and want a game with challenging gameplay (because almost everything is random), you might enjoy this game, but I must warn, this game also require lots of strategy gaming skills (quick eyes, fast hand, perception etc.), so if you're suck at this kind of game don't bother buying it, I'm serious, don't buy it.

												Interesting game it involves smashing zombies and saving civilians. different teams of government units set of snipers, artillery etc.The price is a bit steep for what you get in terms of game mechanics, but I guess people gotta eat. :PAs the game goes on the urgency and peril as more and more sections getting infested and it's your job to try and clear out zones before they get to a point of no return where the whole map gets overwhelmed.

Rescue blocks that are running from other blocks with your blocks doesn't sound at all interesting but wow this game is great. You build your 'defences' prior to the zombie attack, then hope to god that they do the job while your helicopter rescues poor civs and scientists. Add to that the fact that you can speed up or slow down gameplay for quick results and/or micro management of your defences, this game has a lot to give.			",283,68,19,35,49,9,44

												This is a fun and interesting strategy title. It has a very basic format, and its pretty easy to just jump into. Its fairly short, but replayable. Its more like a strategy boardgame, not quite on a high strategy type level, much more basic than that, but I would compare it to something like risk. Its a little goofy, but in a fun sort of way. The story is something straight out of one of those cheesy horror flicks from the fifties.			",80,30,3,26,15,1,19

												Its kind of like a tower defense game but without towers and instead of preventing enemies from getting to one point you're trying to prevent a hoard of zombies from converting city survivors into fellow zombies. You use a helicopter to round up nearby survivors and evacate them while you're mercs hold off the zombies. Not all mercs are purely combative though. You have infantry, snipers, and artillery but there are other units like the zombie bait or barricades that don't kill the zombies but rather slow them down. They can also level up and you can select permenant upgrades for them. This game has a uniquie art style and music and although the gameplay graphics are simplistic (purple boxes = zombies, yellow boxes = survivors) it's somewhat charming.Overall, its a fun strategy game with a zombie twist which is rare.

												While based on what I have only seen as a genre of flash games where you blow up sections of cities to prevent zombies spreading it is so developed it doesn't feel anything like that. From the insane short comics that leave you even more confused about the context, the awesome power of the superweapon (so much more satisfying when you've used regular weapons), the stylish and minimalist graphics, the satisfaction of a plan gone right or the tension as to whether you can kill the last zombie or rescue the last civilians in time, it's just a strange, rather unique and fun experience.

												Right now you're probably thinking ""Oh god not another cheap zombie game."" Well prepare to feel bad about yourself. It IS a cheap zombie game, but that's just the start. AZS proudly wears its indie status on its sleeve, with ultra lo-fi graphics consisting mostly of barely-animated 2d sprites and hordes of tiny dots, backed up by a tightly designed core gameplay that combines the best elements of RTS and tower defense games to create a truly unique experience. Randomly generated scenarios constantly force players to rethink strategies from one turn to the next, giving the whole thing an impressive amount of depth, while a variety of customizable gameplay parameters allow you to tailor the game to your particular tastes and skill level. It's damned clever, highly replayable, and dirt cheap: buy this.			",268,83,4,26,26,5,46

												Short Review: Simple and Brilliant. get it.Mediumish review: Atom Zombie Smasher (AZS) is a strategy game about delaying the inevitable. Zombies kill em. The game is very simple: tiny pink dots(zeds) are taking over and you(you) have to save little yellow dots(civies). You get a cusomized loadout of your choice ( snipers ,infantry ,artillery ,etc.). with this loadout you fight zombies and win by either: killing all zombies before night or saving all civilians ( that survived). Just buy it.			",179,34,1,22,20,1,18

												Very entertaining game. I love zombies already, and tower defense games. This game isn't really tower defense, though it shares some concepts from it. In this game you  try and save as many people from zombies as you can, dropping an evac copter down and covering with artillary and infantry, etc. One of the cool things is it has lots of mods, and the mod list and picker is all integrated into the game. Takes exactly 1 click to download a mod, and then another one to activate it. Plus you can tweak the game options when starting a game to make it super easy or super hard or anything in between, so its easy to customize your experience. Watch the trailer, it gives you a sense of the game. Thumbs up			",1029,307,26,155,113,9,216

												Atom Zombie Smasher is a strategy game where you defeat the zombie invasion by repelling  or destroying hordes of zombies as they close in on the survivors you're trying to rescue.The game has an overworld campaign, where you try to prevent the zombies from spreading out of control, and the city section, where you kill lots of zombies. The overworld plays a bit like Risk. The city sections play very differently depending on what weapons you have available, and this is random. If you have artillery and snipers, it's not too hard to annihilate the zombies quickly. If you have roadblocks and bait, then you need to get everyone out quickly.I've definitely enjoyed it so far. The biggest flaws are its weak tutorial and the fact that a bad choice of random weapons might force you to concede a map. But, the strategy's good and it's fun to play. I haven't tried the local co-op yet... seems fun though.If you like strategy games, I think this is worth picking up, but your milage may vary.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

This game comes ready for mods to and easy to make yourself, so even if the procedurally generated stuff isn't enough there is always more. The tactics mixed with sheer dread of the horde coming at you makes this game a nail biter, even when out of the action and waiting the zed's points tick up and yours slowly trying to keep in pace.

I went into this game for steams summer achievement but found I was still playing it long after the achievement had popped. Quite addicting and very unique in its style and gameplay.  You atart off in a zombie apocolypse and are a commander controlling mercernaries.  You pick a place on the map to try and rescue civilians while killing zombies.  At first you don't start with much (just a rescue helicopter) but eventually you get demolitions mercs, barricades, mines, infrantry, snipers, artillery and even some super weapons to help you destroy all the zombies on a map.  I could go on about how deep the game can get but just give it a try for yourself if you have a few dollars to spare.			",568,108,34,82,52,7,47

												A very simple yet fun game where you take control of the army and try to rescue survivors and/or eliminate the threat in a zombie-ridden apocalyptic fictional country. Everything happens on maps but in real-time, you get a variety of mercenary types such as infantries, rooftop snipers, artillery or defensive structures/traps. So from a top-down view you can pretty much play it like any other RTS game, in a more 8bit-ish ""actiony"" way. You also get to rescue scientists and can 'consume' them to get new unlocks which gives you extra skills and whatnot.It's a little game which you can hop right into action and have a good time without being have to bother with anything, great to spend some time and well worth the money despite it's simplicity.

												This little indie packed more fun than what I first expected. The game is really fun to play. aesthetics come together perfectly and the game has great replay value. However, some might feel that it lacks in content and therefore I like to think of this game as a chocolate treat. Short, but sweet. The game is set up so that it is easy to modify and download mods. Which in turn makes up for lack of content. In my opinion anyhow.			",257,70,6,31,28,2,48

												Challenging strategy game about rescuing cilvilians and killing the zombies who are trying to attack them. Don't play through expecting to win the first time. Think of it more  like a board game, learning new stategies each time you play, trying new upgrade routes to see what works. Then try some of the many modes for more challenges or fun.

												The demo sets expectations for the full game pretty well - it's more of the same.  I like this game - I completed two playthroughs in 3 hours (making it semi-casual), and it presents a set of interesting tactics.  The in-game tutorial gives you some faulty advice that I didn't overcome until the second playthrough.  In my mind, the trick to strategy is to get as close to perfect on easy missions as you can, which denies victory points to the zombies. If you can claim territory while you do this, then you can set up an ongoing 'revenue stream', which gets you unlocks.  You get scientists slower this way, but VP is better than scientists most of the time. ",108,42,2,50,58,1,54

												The good: It's fairly innovative, the writing is clever-ish, and the setting is interesting.The bad: f the RNG doesn't like you, you lose. If the RNG likes you, you win. That's it. The units you get on each map are random, see. There's a game setting that lets you pick your mercenaries, but there's absolutely no point in varying your tactics.In the end, it's a fun diversion, but it suffers from extreme balance issues. Still, give it a look; it's one of the few worthwhile zombie games out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A rather enjoyable game... but it suffers from artifical difficulty instead of real difficulty.  Basically its an altered version of Tower Defense, but without the towers.  You are given a few skills each level and you must tell the Helecopter to pick up people before the zombie dots get them.   Pretty fun at first, but as you progress, you are still limited to only a few skills per level.  It never gets hectic just requires a bit of planning early on.  If you mess up early on, the late game can be brutal.All and all, pretty good but flawed.  IMO it should have become hectic with tons of skills.  Instead of a few skills needed to be in very stratigic locations.  In addition, you cannot use the same skills two levels in a row because they are ""on missions"".  I'd only recommend it if you dig this sort of thing.  Watch a youtube video and consider the purchase since its obviously not for everyone.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

												A suprisingly fun game I got from the Humble Indie Bundle 3.  Basically plays out like a little board game / cribbage hybrid with active mission scenarios Use your mercenaries to hold off / kill zombies and rescue survivors in these missions, and try to capture them to score more points on your victory track.  You can restart missions as often as you want if you dont like the result and speed up or slow down the game, which is nice.  The music is fitting and the controls work well for the most part.  I don't like the finger-snap noise you get when selecting mercs though.A pretty nice game.  I could see myself coming back to this every now and then for some idle timewasting, without it feeling like too much of a timesink.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												Sometimes, you must slaughter a few cows to save the herd, and in this game some deliberate collateral damage will be a virtual necessity.Basically, you fly out to a bunch of rather urban-looking towns populated by civvies (yellow dots), where zombies (purple dots) start pouring in from the outskirts. You, from a high-flying bird's-eye view, direct efforts to airlift the civvies the heck out of there while using snipers, commandos, barricades, dynamite, mortar fire, and more to hold back or redirect the tide of zombies. Infection spreads FAST, and there's no penalty for getting a little, uh, extreme with your methods, so... yeah. Sledgehammers for nails. If you're quick, you can blow up all the zombies and win that way, too.There's also a strategy element where you choose upgrades for your troops, direct research focus, and pick which town to try to evacuate based on your current (random) assignment of weaponry and tools. Still, the meat of the game is evacuating towns.			",425,131,0,62,38,2,51

												Atom Zombie Smasher is my favorite game, so far, to come from Blendo Games. They are a quirky game company so their games can be a mixed bag but that's very okay because they are not afraid to try new things and think outside of the box. Atom Zombie Smasher mixes RTS, tower defense, and a bit of turn based strategy. The object of the game is to rescue civilians from cities that are under zombie attack. While rescuing them, you fend off the zombies with mercenary teams that you acquire throughout the campaign. You also have to try to capture cities and strategically select cities to rescue to help stop the spread of the zombies. It's kind of like the board game, Pandemic, mixed with some tower defense. The visuals in this game are very simplistic. People and zombies are represented by cubes. It may seem like a silly decision but it actually helps to maintain a fun atmosphere to the game to have colorful cubes running around the city. Most zombie apocalypse games have dark and gritty atmospheres to create a horror setting. You won't find that here. Atom Zombie Smasher is all about the strategy and the frantic game-play. Add a ""Christmas"" mini-game, co-op, and mod support and you've got a great game. 9/10			",90,9,2,5,4,0,9

												One of my top twenty games of the last few decades . . . when it works. It is really addictive, twitchy strategy, and you have more choice than you might realize when you set up a game -- you can choose whether you want random mercs for a greater challenge, or choose your teams, or add options to make it even harder, and a longer or shorter game may grant you more victories based on your play style. If you're frustrated, just change the options. Cute story, kind of nonsensically artsy, think Monty Python surrealism as told by Quentin Tarantino.  That being said, it can be kinda tricky to set up to run in the first place -- you might not have any problems, but based on your system, you may also sit there for an hour trying out different graphics and launch options through the forums and the dev FAQ before it runs, or before you can actually see the whole screen. Be patient, it's worth it, you'll probably get it running, but be prepared that you may need to figure out how to launch it. Not DOS-game hard to set up, but requiring more persistence than most modern games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a lot more fun and exciting than videos and screenshots can convey. It's a strategy game that somehow manages to be simple, complex, and captivating all at once.It has an overworld map sort of like the board game Risk.  Selecting a zone on the overworld starts a real-time strategy mode where you try to rescue civilians and kill zombies before nightfall (usually about a minute or two).  The difficulty is variable depending on what units you have available during the missions, but there's plenty of options to reconfigure the game to your liking.There's a demo, so give it a try and see for yourself.This game is frequently packaged with other indie games, so keep an eye out for bundles and get even more for your money!

												Atom Zombie Smasher is a my favorite Blendo Games title. It's a brilliant casual realtime strategy game that's tense, strategic, flexible, and most of all, a lot of fun. I've heard a few people describe it as ""tower defense"", but that's really pigeon-holing it and doing a disservice to a new player's expectations. It's true that a large portion of the strategy is in controlling the flow of the enemy, but it's not nearly as deterministic and simple as that implies. Also there are no towers. The feel of the game is much more about thinking on your feet, and dealing with disasters as they're unfolding in real (or slowed down) time.You can play any way you want by modifying the campaign settings, letting you restart levels at no cost for that perfectionist victory, or turning on permadeath and a variety of difficulty mods for more intense and less forgiving sessions.The entire game takes place in the same universe as Brendon Chung's other tiles, including Gravity Bone, 30 Flights of Loving, and Flotilla. Chung's unique humor and sensibilities come through in the form of a large number of vignettes and background articles describing the characters in and around events of the game, and the whole experience is topped off with an amazing instrumental surf rock soundtrack by The Volcanics.

												A great real time strategy game. The premise is to move out to various cities and rescue surviors by placing a ""go here"" mark that your helicopter arrives at every so often to pick up survivors. The game is seen entirely from a bird eyes view giving you full awareness of where the survivors are and where the zombies are coming from. Over time you earn various mercenaries and items to help. Snipers, soldiers, barricades, cannons, mines, nukes, and more. These can all be leveled up over time. Saving scientists allow you to buy various extra upgrades. You might save every survivor from a city, or maybe become overwhelmed and lose. You simply move from city to city saving as much as possible. The game is a race to see who can get enough points first. You get points for saving people, clearing cities, etc. The zombies get points for eating people, taking over cities, etc. Whoever reaches the point goal wins, so the game has a board game feel. NOW GET OUT THERE AND BEAT THE ZAMBIES!			",211,52,3,18,14,3,25

												AZS is a great indie game in the tradition of minimalist game going for maximal gameplay. Start off with just a chopper trying to recuse civilians from zombies and slowly build up your roster and level up your units. As the game progresses the zombies become more numerous and harder to control until you need to resort to the ultimate Llama bombs!Great replay value, moddable and fun you can kill 5 minutes or 50 with equal ease.

												Atom Zombie Smasher is my favorite game, so far, to come from Blendo Games. They are a quirky game company so their games can be a mixed bag but that's very okay because they are not afraid to try new things and think outside of the box. Atom Zombie Smasher mixes RTS, tower defense, and a bit of turn based strategy. The object of the game is to rescue civilians from cities that are under zombie attack. While rescuing them, you fend off the zombies with mercenary teams that you acquire throughout the campaign. You also have to try to capture cities and strategically select cities to rescue to help stop the spread of the zombies. It's kind of like the board game, Pandemic, mixed with some tower defense.

The game is very simple: tiny pink dots(zeds) are taking over and you(you) have to save little yellow dots(civies). You get a cusomized loadout of your choice ( snipers ,infantry ,artillery ,etc.). with this loadout you fight zombies and win by either: killing all zombies before night or saving all civilians ( that survived). Just buy it.			",179,34,1,22,20,1,18

												Atom Zombie Smasher is a my favorite Blendo Games title. It's a brilliant casual realtime strategy game that's tense, strategic, flexible, and most of all, a lot of fun. I've heard a few people describe it as ""tower defense"", but that's really pigeon-holing it and doing a disservice to a new player's expectations. It's true that a large portion of the strategy is in controlling the flow of the enemy, but it's not nearly as deterministic and simple as that implies. Also there are no towers. The feel of the game is much more about thinking on your feet, and dealing with disasters as they're unfolding in real (or slowed down) time.You can play any way you want by modifying the campaign settings, letting you restart levels at no cost for that perfectionist victory, or turning on permadeath and a variety of difficulty mods for more intense and less forgiving sessions.The entire game takes place in the same universe as Brendon Chung's other tiles, including Gravity Bone, 30 Flights of Loving, and Flotilla. Chung's unique humor and sensibilities come through in the form of a large number of vignettes and background articles describing the characters in and around events of the game, and the whole experience is topped off with an amazing instrumental surf rock soundtrack by The Volcanics.

												First things first, the game's aesthetic and the BGM are right up my alley. Your mileage might vary since they are both quite distinctive.The game is played to x points, you vs the zombies. Each game begins with a helicopter rescue of civilians from a zombie attack on a neighbourhood in a randomly-generated city. As the game progresses, with each new day the player gains a new weapon/squad/tool, zombie infections grow worse/more widespread, and the game's complexity rises steadily. As the scenarios become more complex, they become steadily more frantic. Tactics and strategies diversify gradually with your new toys since zombies and infections follow set rules that must be exploited to earn high scores (and one must since the computer's score increases at a geometric rate if player don't keep a healthy lead).

												Atom Zombie Smasher is my favorite game, so far, to come from Blendo Games. They are a quirky game company so their games can be a mixed bag but that's very okay because they are not afraid to try new things and think outside of the box. Atom Zombie Smasher mixes RTS, tower defense, and a bit of turn based strategy. The object of the game is to rescue civilians from cities that are under zombie attack. While rescuing them, you fend off the zombies with mercenary teams that you acquire throughout the campaign. You also have to try to capture cities and strategically select cities to rescue to help stop the spread of the zombies. It's kind of like the board game, Pandemic, mixed with some tower defense. The visuals in this game are very simplistic. People and zombies are represented by cubes. It may seem like a silly decision but it actually helps to maintain a fun atmosphere to the game to have colorful cubes running around the city. Most zombie apocalypse games have dark and gritty atmospheres to create a horror setting. You won't find that here. Atom Zombie Smasher is all about the strategy and the frantic game-play. Add a ""Christmas"" mini-game, co-op, and mod support and you've got a great game. 9/10			",90,9,2,5,4,0,9

												Challenging.  It took me a while to beat this one.  There's what I call a ""tipping point"" to this game where you will know whether you can win the game or not.  If you're not doing well, you'll know after a few levels that there is no way to come back from the deficit. A few times, I made it halfway through to only realize I would probably lose at the end...very frustrating. You need points and to do well to gain experience for your troops, more experience means your troops will perform better which will be key to winning. If you just happend to skate by each level, that won't be enough to dominate.  Anyway, I didn't like this game at first, but got into it to earn the achievements.  It's a very simple game, but done well. Atom Zombie Smashers would work well as an app on an ipad or kindle or some sort of tablet.  I created a mod which was fun. Music and sound effects were good.

												Mind - it's been about four months since I last played this game. That noted, I highly recommend it, at least when it's on sale.The game is fun, unique and has an interesting (if not limited) plot. It also has a fairly well developed interface and it can be challenging without being frustrating. It also has a lot of replay value.Unfortunately, it can get repetitive and I feel that it could use more to ""do"", as after a certain point you're just doing the same thing over and over with little to up the difficulty or change game play. It can also walk a fine line between ""way too short and easy"" and ""tiringly long and boring"", depending on what features you choose to enable or disable from the start. I've also begun to run into a few glitches (crashes), which make playing it challenging.Still, it's fun and unique, and that makes it a good deal better than most of the content you find.Over all:7/10.

												A new take on killing zombies from above using an arsenal of mad weapons and mercenary crews. Not as much focus on the violence, which leaves room for the planning and sheer panic of trying to get your citizens out of the city alive and not falling into outbreak by letting one simple zombie into the crowd.The gameplay leaves room for challenge as each month you'll have rostered mercenaries which some fights only leaves you with roadblocks mines and snipers. Though very satisfying when you complete the mission.All in all it has probably been the best $2.49 I have ever spent on a game, I would honestly of paid more for it.Fun, addictive and challenging.

Calming early 60's polynesian rock tunes keep you just detached enough from the plight of the peons fleeing for their lives on the ground, while comic book vignettes and an overarching campaign against zed remind you from time to time that this is for serious though.PROS:+small unit operations zombie defense game+kickin' soundtrack+so many mutators make for a decent replay value+same story about the unit selection/randomization+llama bombsCONS:-some strong units make lesser ones obsolete-first two missions of any campaign are always the same story-game transitions from evac/containment to extermination very quicklyvalue for money is there, for sure, hope a similar game with a larger scale comes out, any luck from the same team.7.5/10 if you're all hung up on ratings.

												Its kind of like a tower defense game but without towers and instead of preventing enemies from getting to one point you're trying to prevent a hoard of zombies from converting city survivors into fellow zombies. You use a helicopter to round up nearby survivors and evacate them while you're mercs hold off the zombies. Not all mercs are purely combative though. You have infantry, snipers, and artillery but there are other units like the zombie bait or barricades that don't kill the zombies but rather slow them down. They can also level up and you can select permenant upgrades for them. This game has a uniquie art style and music and although the gameplay graphics are simplistic (purple boxes = zombies, yellow boxes = survivors) it's somewhat charming.Overall, its a fun strategy game with a zombie twist which is rare.

This game comes ready for mods to and easy to make yourself, so even if the procedurally generated stuff isn't enough there is always more. The tactics mixed with sheer dread of the horde coming at you makes this game a nail biter, even when out of the action and waiting the zed's points tick up and yours slowly trying to keep in pace.

Save scientists, rescue civilians and bomb the hell out of the zombie pest that ravages the cities.The concept is rather old, but the execution is simply awesome and addictive. It is lacking somewhat in replay value, but it kept me entertained for hours, and knowing my gaming habits I will occasionally play this in the future.It is quick to learn, simple to understand and a whole lot of fun.

												A great real time strategy game. The premise is to move out to various cities and rescue surviors by placing a ""go here"" mark that your helicopter arrives at every so often to pick up survivors. The game is seen entirely from a bird eyes view giving you full awareness of where the survivors are and where the zombies are coming from. Over time you earn various mercenaries and items to help. Snipers, soldiers, barricades, cannons, mines, nukes, and more. These can all be leveled up over time. Saving scientists allow you to buy various extra upgrades. You might save every survivor from a city, or maybe become overwhelmed and lose. You simply move from city to city saving as much as possible. The game is a race to see who can get enough points first. You get points for saving people, clearing cities, etc. The zombies get points for eating people, taking over cities, etc. Whoever reaches the point goal wins, so the game has a board game feel. NOW GET OUT THERE AND BEAT THE ZAMBIES!			",211,52,3,18,14,3,25

I have invested several hours into Atom Zombie Smasher, and I have to admit, I don't regret a single second of it.

Ground level it is all about planning and positioning, you need to evacuate n civilians (sic) before zombies get to them and infect them.Graphics are very simple, and the AI is the same, but it's challenging because of the positioning aspect. You have a bunch of different resources, most of which are stationary, and you need to figure out how exactly to use them to buy yourself enough time to rescue the civvies.It's great fun.

												Great fun, but could easily be hit-and-miss as to whether you'd like the game. It's a clever strategy game, different every time you play - sometimes frustratingly so, where you're set up with cities and a run of mercenaries which won't possibly let you out-pace the zombies in ""score"" - but this just encourages you to play again and hone your strategies. Check out the trailer or try the demo if you think it might tickle your fancy.			",524,203,30,91,63,5,136

												Innovative, tactical, highly replayable, musically excellent and locally co-op. AZS is my favourite indie game of 2011 so far, and probably the best (and most original) zombie game for many years to come.			",504,126,9,54,58,6,99

												It's fun. Sort of like Risk, but with zombies, at least in the tactical screen. Ground level it is all about planning and positioning, you need to evacuate n civilians (sic) before zombies get to them and infect them.Graphics are very simple, and the AI is the same, but it's challenging because of the positioning aspect. You have a bunch of different resources, most of which are stationary, and you need to figure out how exactly to use them to buy yourself enough time to rescue the civvies.It's great fun. Worth getting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great little diversion, plenty of replay value and one of the few games out there that has little basis in reality, yet, you feel like you're really in control of a situation. An action puzzle game with infinite variables that will keep you on your toes.The art design is inspired, as are the music and sound effects, though the music will likely get a bit old as time goes on, there isn't any variety in the soundtrack.I bought this long before I was active on steam and recently re-aquired it though a humble bundle so ignore the hours played, as it is off by at least 20-30 hours.

												I love this game. It's a unique and twisted take on the zombie apocalypse that we all know is coming. You command a limited number of mercenary units tasked with rescuing as many civilians as possible from a city being slowly overrun with zombies. It's a top-down, bird's-eye strategy game with a lot of charm.It's procedurally generated, so each game plays significantly differently. Each game can also be customized in several ways, and if you don't like the options given it's easy to mod.Mostly though, I enjoy Atom Zombie Smashers because of its personality. The surf guitar intro, crazy vignettes, and real sense of danger in each of the missions.			",62,23,0,32,5,0,27

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Atom Zombie Smasher is a game developed by Blendo Games. It is a great game to pickup-and-play quickly with some great humor in there, good skills and varying troops, challanging but not boring-repeat style, very good ""save the citizens"" with artilary and troop deployment game.It is quick and easy to learn. It includes good humor and some well hidden easter eggs. It offers tons of replayability, with the ability to change settings of gameworld. It offers a good amount of varying troops to deploy, alongside your main gun and challenging ""fights"" to play, but easily restartable if you mess up.However, Atom Zombie Smasher does not offer that much in terms of graphics, top-down style with pixels, this isnot including the art in cutscenes. It can get, however very rarly, get frustrating and there is no control over where citizens go, sometimes being unpredictable and walking into a zombie.Atom Zombie Smasher is a bit of a shot-in-the-dark game, but it is quite good, a nice take on the zombie apocalypse with trying to save citizens and reaching you're goal before the zombies get too big in numbers. Loads of different versions of troops and they are also upgradable! You are able to also redirect the zombies (with citizens or blocking off pathways) and the map is mostly destructibleThis is another one of the better Blendo Games' the company has to offer and one of my favourites! RECOMMENDED :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite games.  I keep coming back to it for short bursts.  The graphics are from impresive, but work well for the game.  The bulk of the game is rescuing civilians from a city getting over run by zombies.  You get varios units to try and control the zombie flow.  At an uper level your spend reserch points for bonuses, and try to mange witch city you fight in to slow the spread of the zombies.  There is enough game setup options and randomness to keep you intrested in this well after you've gotten your worth out of it.			",226,81,3,59,45,4,75

												For $10  I haven't found a better bargain game.  For those of you who like Real time strategy games, this one delivers.  The very minimalistic graphics hide an intensely fun strategy game where you have to manage your troops and guess the movements of both your enemies and the civilians you are trying to save.   For $10 you unlock so many more modes then offered in the demo, including the much more relaxing ""casual"" mode.   This game is worth the entry price for sure, and you should get several good hours of play out of it if you like the demo.			",242,77,1,105,38,5,108

												A new take on killing zombies from above using an arsenal of mad weapons and mercenary crews. Not as much focus on the violence, which leaves room for the planning and sheer panic of trying to get your citizens out of the city alive and not falling into outbreak by letting one simple zombie into the crowd.The gameplay leaves room for challenge as each month you'll have rostered mercenaries which some fights only leaves you with roadblocks mines and snipers. Though very satisfying when you complete the mission.All in all it has probably been the best $2.49 I have ever spent on a game, I would honestly of paid more for it.Fun, addictive and challenging.

												Atom Zombie Smashers is one of the best zombie strategy games I've ever played. The goal is to evacuate the population with helicopters. You plant the rescue points and the defenses and you fight against the zed hordes. Each fallen citizen becomes the enemy.Graphically it is just a map of the city looked from the top, and each citizen, zombie, soldier and trap is a square with a color, so don't buy this thinking this is going to have a lot of gore or fancy graphics. This is pure strategy, and of the best.			",697,171,26,80,62,9,120

												I've read a lot of good things about this game and I've read a lot of bad things about this game so I tried to keep an open mind going in. I personally think the game fundamentals are solid, but you have to look past the cheesy graphics. The overall impression I get is Risk meets Choplifter with minimal tower defense and real time strategy elements.There is technically no way to win--there are only degrees of losing. The goal is to rescue as many non-infected as you can or destroy the zombie hordes before nightfall. You are given a basic assortment of mercenaries for offensive purposes which level up as they gain experience, and it's only after they start leveling that the game's fun factor is uncovered; just watch out for the friendly fire! Achievements are always a plus. The price tag is a bit on the heavy side for my expectations, but it would be wise to download the demo and judge for yourself. Overall, I found it to be a refreshing distraction.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												Very entertaining game. I love zombies already, and tower defense games. This game isn't really tower defense, though it shares some concepts from it. In this game you  try and save as many people from zombies as you can, dropping an evac copter down and covering with artillary and infantry, etc. One of the cool things is it has lots of mods, and the mod list and picker is all integrated into the game. Takes exactly 1 click to download a mod, and then another one to activate it. Plus you can tweak the game options when starting a game to make it super easy or super hard or anything in between, so its easy to customize your experience. Watch the trailer, it gives you a sense of the game. Thumbs up			",1029,307,26,155,113,9,216

												Atom Zombie Smasher is a strategy game where you defeat the zombie invasion by repelling  or destroying hordes of zombies as they close in on the survivors you're trying to rescue.The game has an overworld campaign, where you try to prevent the zombies from spreading out of control, and the city section, where you kill lots of zombies. The overworld plays a bit like Risk. The city sections play very differently depending on what weapons you have available, and this is random. If you have artillery and snipers, it's not too hard to annihilate the zombies quickly. If you have roadblocks and bait, then you need to get everyone out quickly.I've definitely enjoyed it so far. The biggest flaws are its weak tutorial and the fact that a bad choice of random weapons might force you to concede a map. But, the strategy's good and it's fun to play. I haven't tried the local co-op yet... seems fun though.If you like strategy games, I think this is worth picking up, but your milage may vary.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												I love this game. It takes elements of tower defense, board games and  old school arcade games and combines them with some bizarre humor to create a marvelous game. Once you play through a couple of times there's not much draw for me personally but I really enjoyed all the off-the-wall vignettes and the upgrade path for the first few times. A solid experience.

												The demo sets expectations for the full game pretty well - it's more of the same.  I like this game - I completed two playthroughs in 3 hours (making it semi-casual), and it presents a set of interesting tactics.  The in-game tutorial gives you some faulty advice that I didn't overcome until the second playthrough.  In my mind, the trick to strategy is to get as close to perfect on easy missions as you can, which denies victory points to the zombies. If you can claim territory while you do this, then you can set up an ongoing 'revenue stream', which gets you unlocks.  You get scientists slower this way, but VP is better than scientists most of the time. ",108,42,2,50,58,1,54

												Sadly it took the steam Christmas Achivements to get me to play this game. I had way more fun than I expected and look forward to playing it more. It can be a little unforgiving not letting you back out of an area, instead forcing you to ""concede"" and lose a round with no progress (which cost me the whole campagin when I didn't realize there was nobody to rescue in the level 4 regoins and was stuck with nothing but explosive charges and mines) but overall really fantastic game. Worth buying and playing.			",621,195,16,62,69,9,77

												One way of describing Atom Zombie Smasher is to call it a real time strategy game...but I think that this still fails to fully describe the experience of playing Atom Zombie Smasher....You play as a commander who must save civilians, exterminate zombies and rid the area of Nuevos Aires of the zombie infestation in a world set in the 1960's. You are scored based on how many civilians you rescue, how many zombies you kill and how quickly you achieve this.The storyline campaign features a map of Nuevos Aires divided into regions (the number of regions can be edited according to how long you want to play for or what target score you set). Regions are coloured according to whether they are infested with zombies, have been liberated by you or have had all the life bombed out of them. Regions are also numbered to show the extent of zombie infestation, with higher numbers indicating a larger number of zombies to kill.You have access to a helicopter (which airlifts people to safety) and then attack units to use to help you kill zombies. Attack units include ground infantry, snipers, dynamite, road blocks, etc, but you can only use 4 attack units at a time. Once you have chosen a region, you launch into a square map with randomly placed buildings, roads and civilians. You will be shown where zombies will approach from and asked to place your units on the map in strategically chosen locations. When you're done, you watch as the zombies move in and the level commences. You can move a few units after placing them, but not for most of them, so you have to really think hard about where you put them.There are comic book style cutscenes which appear randomly and explain the game's backstory. The cutscenes have a certain brand of dark humour which I find hilarious, but some people might not appreciate.You can also adjust game settings to make things easier or harder depending on what you want to get out of the game. For example, you can start out with all attack units, allow zombies to spawn inside a region, allow mega zombies, etc.Overall, this is a game worth looking at if you like strategy games.

												This game is probably my favorite tower defense game.  It's an original concept with a crisp, yet minimal UI, varied scenarios and a good difficulty ramp-up.  The units you use and how you choose to use them doesn't feel as ""linear"" and expected as in most tower defense games and the perks you unlock as you ""level up"" a unit can really fit almost any person's particular play style.

												A surprisingly fun and deep game, despite a rather 'simple' appearance. Gameplay may start off slow and methodical, but it'll begin to tax your multi-tasking skills as the pace picks up and you realize that a single micromanaged squad of mercs won't hold off the horde. The art style is unique, and the music is top notch. Pick it up - this is certainly a little hidden jem that you'll get some hours out of.			",191,23,2,30,16,2,42

												Atom Zombie Smasher is from Blendo Games, the guy(s) that made gravitybone, the delightful spy game with tons of style (it's free and 15 minutes long, try it out.) It retains that style through presentation of the fantastically dry vignettes, music, and silly gameplay, and helps make it one of my favorite indie games from the last year.It's an active RTS where you try to save as many clumsy people from swarming, clumsy zombies (and everything is just colored blocks). Maps and your set of mercenaries (basically 'powers', like landmines, artillery shells, moveable/invincible infantry, etc.) are randomly generated. Combined with very simple modding, it's good fun to play a campaign every few weeks and tweak a bunch of settings. All infantry, tons of super fast zombies, quick to flee civilians. It just devolves into clicking frantically and yelling (in a good way (see: Trackmania).)One last thing: It can be kinda frustrating. Mod it to your difficulty liking.			",262,67,2,28,19,0,34

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Atom Zombie Smasher is a game developed by Blendo Games. It is a great game to pickup-and-play quickly with some great humor in there, good skills and varying troops, challanging but not boring-repeat style, very good ""save the citizens"" with artilary and troop deployment game.It is quick and easy to learn. It includes good humor and some well hidden easter eggs. It offers tons of replayability, with the ability to change settings of gameworld. It offers a good amount of varying troops to deploy, alongside your main gun and challenging ""fights"" to play, but easily restartable if you mess up.However, Atom Zombie Smasher does not offer that much in terms of graphics, top-down style with pixels, this isnot including the art in cutscenes. It can get, however very rarly, get frustrating and there is no control over where citizens go, sometimes being unpredictable and walking into a zombie.Atom Zombie Smasher is a bit of a shot-in-the-dark game, but it is quite good, a nice take on the zombie apocalypse with trying to save citizens and reaching you're goal before the zombies get too big in numbers. Loads of different versions of troops and they are also upgradable! You are able to also redirect the zombies (with citizens or blocking off pathways) and the map is mostly destructibleThis is another one of the better Blendo Games' the company has to offer and one of my favourites! RECOMMENDED :)  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite games.  I keep coming back to it for short bursts.  The graphics are from impresive, but work well for the game.  The bulk of the game is rescuing civilians from a city getting over run by zombies.  You get varios units to try and control the zombie flow.  At an uper level your spend reserch points for bonuses, and try to mange witch city you fight in to slow the spread of the zombies.  There is enough game setup options and randomness to keep you intrested in this well after you've gotten your worth out of it.			",226,81,3,59,45,4,75

												A very light RTS style game where you strategically place randomly selected units such as Snipers or Barricades to protect your helicopters landing zone. You have a minimum amount of people to rescue on each level and anyone touched by a zombie instantly becomes one themselves. This can prove disastrous when you have the majority of the people on the map waiting at your landing zone and a lone zombie comes in and converts the entire lot of them. This really makes you plan your unit placement very carefully, which is really the core gameplay. After the match starts there’s usually not all that much to do but watch, save for a few actions such as changing your landing zone location or redirecting your snipers cover area.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game, this is not even a genre I would consider my favorite. There are quite a few game modes to choose from but I found the game to be very easy if you opt to be able to pick which units you use every match. I found being forced to come up with new strategies when the units were selected randomly to really be the main challenge and fun of the game.-Playtime-The game is a lot of fun for a fairly short amount of time. While you can play as many campaigns as you want with varying game modes, the core gameplay doesn’t really change much and the game will probably wear out its welcome after about 10-15 hours.-Achievements-Nothing that different from what you would do during normal gameplay, most are just accumulative achievements. Luring massive hordes with Bait into waiting Dynamite for its kill achievement was fun though. 100% becomes a grind for the 500 Gold Medals, once you have Artillery built up a matches can take less than a minute each but it's still a grind.Recommended on sale.

												I've read a lot of good things about this game and I've read a lot of bad things about this game so I tried to keep an open mind going in. I personally think the game fundamentals are solid, but you have to look past the cheesy graphics. The overall impression I get is Risk meets Choplifter with minimal tower defense and real time strategy elements.There is technically no way to win--there are only degrees of losing. The goal is to rescue as many non-infected as you can or destroy the zombie hordes before nightfall. You are given a basic assortment of mercenaries for offensive purposes which level up as they gain experience, and it's only after they start leveling that the game's fun factor is uncovered; just watch out for the friendly fire! Achievements are always a plus. The price tag is a bit on the heavy side for my expectations, but it would be wise to download the demo and judge for yourself. Overall, I found it to be a refreshing distraction.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												And I thought this game would be bad. But its actually fun. Its similar to a castle defense kind of game which i hate, but its got the feeling of rescueing people on an operation away from zombies which is more appealing to a guy like me. I also like the 1960's style of the game and the music in it too. Best part of this game is that the developers let you fully mod your own kind of game. For example I edit the code and made zombies really slow. You can switch to your mod or play on default. You can even upload your own mod on the server and have others download. I played some other player's mods too. Very helpful for achievement hunters!			",103,12,3,5,9,1,19

												Really unique strategy with decent local coop support.A lot of the fun for me is in strategizing at the beginning of each mission, trying to figure out optimal unit placements, etc. The second half of the game - actually executing that strategy - can be nail-bitingly tense, even with the game's simple, abstract graphics.It does a great job of conveying a sense of desperation and dread as the zombies (usually) override all defenses come nightfall. My one complaint is that the difficulty is somewhat hard to tune. After a few runs through the campaign it can start feeling a little too easy, while the harder difficulties still seem impossible.

												Challenging.  It took me a while to beat this one.  There's what I call a ""tipping point"" to this game where you will know whether you can win the game or not.  If you're not doing well, you'll know after a few levels that there is no way to come back from the deficit. A few times, I made it halfway through to only realize I would probably lose at the end...very frustrating. You need points and to do well to gain experience for your troops, more experience means your troops will perform better which will be key to winning. If you just happend to skate by each level, that won't be enough to dominate.  Anyway, I didn't like this game at first, but got into it to earn the achievements.  It's a very simple game, but done well. Atom Zombie Smashers would work well as an app on an ipad or kindle or some sort of tablet.  I created a mod which was fun. Music and sound effects were good.

												Mind - it's been about four months since I last played this game. That noted, I highly recommend it, at least when it's on sale.The game is fun, unique and has an interesting (if not limited) plot. It also has a fairly well developed interface and it can be challenging without being frustrating. It also has a lot of replay value.Unfortunately, it can get repetitive and I feel that it could use more to ""do"", as after a certain point you're just doing the same thing over and over with little to up the difficulty or change game play. It can also walk a fine line between ""way too short and easy"" and ""tiringly long and boring"", depending on what features you choose to enable or disable from the start. I've also begun to run into a few glitches (crashes), which make playing it challenging.Still, it's fun and unique, and that makes it a good deal better than most of the content you find.Over all:7/10.

												The demo sets expectations for the full game pretty well - it's more of the same.  I like this game - I completed two playthroughs in 3 hours (making it semi-casual), and it presents a set of interesting tactics.  The in-game tutorial gives you some faulty advice that I didn't overcome until the second playthrough.  In my mind, the trick to strategy is to get as close to perfect on easy missions as you can, which denies victory points to the zombies. If you can claim territory while you do this, then you can set up an ongoing 'revenue stream', which gets you unlocks.  You get scientists slower this way, but VP is better than scientists most of the time. ",108,42,2,50,58,1,54

The demo gives you enough gameplay to help you decide if you want to purchase the game or not and I enjoyed my play of it. It's definitly worth buying while on sale, this seems like a good quality $5 game but I wouldn't pay $10 for it, so get it while its on sale. I bought it and its great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A suprisingly fun game I got from the Humble Indie Bundle 3.  Basically plays out like a little board game / cribbage hybrid with active mission scenarios Use your mercenaries to hold off / kill zombies and rescue survivors in these missions, and try to capture them to score more points on your victory track.  You can restart missions as often as you want if you dont like the result and speed up or slow down the game, which is nice.  The music is fitting and the controls work well for the most part.  I don't like the finger-snap noise you get when selecting mercs though.A pretty nice game.  I could see myself coming back to this every now and then for some idle timewasting, without it feeling like too much of a timesink.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

Start off with just a chopper trying to recuse civilians from zombies and slowly build up your roster and level up your units.
