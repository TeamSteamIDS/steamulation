												I bought this game on Disc so ignore my time counter. This is the end all be all of strategy gaming. great balance of units count and variety, simple economics. Aircraft that actually move around for combat. tech trees that are different and yet balanced. a strong campaign and a brutal AI. unfortunately due to the advent of C&C4 (utter garbage) it is the last great C&C.

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath ReviewCommand & Conquer 4: Tiberian TwilightINTRODUCTION:Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is a real-time strategy game that was developed and published by Electronic Arts mostly due to the acquisition of Westwood Studios by EA and Westwood's closure back in 2003. This game continues the Tiberian Sun story arc and is a direct sequel to Tiberian Sun & its expansion Tiberian Sun: Firestorm.Following the franchise tradition, this title follows the story of the almost never ending conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and an international paramilitary / militant religious organization called the Brotherhood of Nod. Unlike its predecessors however, this game introduces a new faction in an effort by EA to add more gameplay diversity. The new faction is known as the Scrin.PROS:+ The game has good art style and graphics: (Both of which aged really well specially since this game was released back in 2008.)+ Very good Sound design and unit voice acting.+ Quality live action cinematic played by very well known Hollywood stars and the ever iconic Joseph D. Kucan as “Kane.”+ Lengthy Campaign for each of the factions (about 20 hours if you play them in the Very Hard difficulty setting)+ Great story that is interwoven with each faction (meaning that each faction “wins” in their own right)+ New Faction that is fun to play and comes with an unlockable Campaign once you finish both GDI and NOD campaigns.+ Old factions (GDI and NOD) has been revamped with new units and playstyles without deviating from their respective origin stories.+ Fast paced and intense action.+ Lore heavy with story continuity from the old games.+ Fun and challenging missions during the campaign.+ Revamped game mechanics such as squad based infantry, super unit capture etc.CONS:- No online multiplayer due to GameSpy shutdown: FIX[cnc-online.net]- Some unit pathfinding quirks- Some balance issues (specially with the super units)- Relatively small maps- Limited tech-tree options and build orders- Campaign strategic options has no real effect- Random difficulty spikes between the campaign missionsNEUTRAL+/- Mission objectives are immediately marked in the map thus depriving the player of map exploration. A.K.A. spoon feeding the player enemy locations.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME that captures the fun and excitement of the old C&C games while adding its own modern ideas to mix thus making for a wonderful and action packed RTS experience.WORTH IT?The game at full price is $15 (or your regional equivalent) thus its a must have for RTS fans and Command & Conquer fans a like. Again I have to stress out that the official multiplayer servers are now permanently offline so you'll have to use CNC:Online[cnc-online.net]  if you want to experience the game's online multiplayer feature.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												I have long been a Command & Conquer fan, starting with Command & Conquer: Red Alert as one of the first PC games I experienced and have since loved to this day. I will side with many others in appreciation of what Command & Conquer 3 accomplished; a return to its roots from the brief transitional period of Generals and stupendous execution of it, at that.Command & Conquer 3, as such, uses a far different method of base construction and economy as compared to traditional real-time strategy games; rather than workers, it relies on the construction yard as both the player's nerve center and primary construction unit. Buildings can be placed in control zones after they have been fully purchased, and are instantly constructed when placed. The player's economy functions through tiberium harvesters, which comb through a field of radioactive crystals rather than attaching themselves to a resource node. For 2007, even though it recalled much of older times in the RTS genre, it was quite a unique game.Gameplay-wise, Command & Conquer 3 is a frantic game of hard counters. Anti-tank troops will rarely be able to take on rifle squads alone, and machine gun turrets will lose handily to main battle tanks. Units can vanish in the blink of an eye without warning, be it from high-potency artillery or sniper ambushes on isolated units. Economy plays a central role, as well; the player who establishes a powerful economy quickly and staunchly will often be the victor, as Command & Conquer games have never featured a supply cap or need for supply structures.For some, this can be a headache. The leading role of economy, knowing troops will often die even with your keenest intervention, and the balancing act of fending off enemy counters in such a fast-paced environment leaves little room for the overly thorough in high-stakes games. Even a strong commander will find themselves in an unenviable position should they lose the economy war, as the frustration of losing harvesters on a stressed budget and watching one's veteran units dwindle with each skirmish can hardly be called a calming state of affairs. Some consider the workerless method of base construction to be backwards and that the over-reliance on economy to decide games is detrimental to the skill involved in playing the game.In terms of storyline, Command & Conquer has always managed to captivate me. It may be nostalgia ballooning the series' writing and acting beyond what it should be, but the plot surrounding the intricate game of cat-and-mouse between GDI and Kane, the corruption of the planet by tiberium (most pointedly, the chilling depictions of red zones), and the live action cutscenes have all served to inspire me on many different levels. Command & Conquer 3's introduction of the Visitors and Kane's prophecy of their arrival have all served to bolster my apprecation of the storyline - C&C4 kept firmly out of mind.While it is unfortunate that Frank Klepacki did not return to grant C&C3 a score similar to the stupendous soundtracks of Red Alert 2 and prior, Steve Jablonsky and Trevor Morris lived up to his quality - if not necessarily style - and brought quality music to the title. Voice acting is more a toss-up, however; while most units offer fitting and well-acted lines, some - most notably Nod's two early scouting vehicles - are overacted to the verge of ridiculousness. Acting, while somewhat overdone in some areas, is enjoyable and mostly believable, and Joseph Kucan's applaudable return as Kane once more can hardly go without notice.Graphics and general sound quality are another toss-up, however. The SAGE engine - used originally for Generals in 2004 - was dated by 2007 standards, especially compared with the Essence engine used by Relic Entertainment in Company of Heroes a year prior. While effects and asset quality are undoubtedly good for their time, the SAGE engine often struggles to keep up, and some oddities can occur from certain situations. Notably, infantry cycling through ""take cover"" shouts on death and strangeness surrounding some explosion effects, such as the ion cannon strike. Audio, on the other hand, sports some noticeable stock sound effects, but is otherwise well-delivered and masterfully crafted for the various atmospheres in the game.Overall, a dedicated real-time strategy gamer could easily find joy in Tiberium Wars, and a dedicated Command & Conquer follower would be mental to let it slip from their library. With mod support aplenty (if not necessarily as accessible as previous C&C titles) and an official map editor freely available, it is hard to say that minor slights could prevent this game from earning its price and thensome.

												I have never been an RTS fan, yet this is my favorite game. Ignore my 452 hours count because I have the retail version of this game too and I have spent at least 2000 hours playing it. The campaign was never interesting to me. I did play it through. A bit buggy and overall boring.  Why play against bots if one can play against human opponents? The only reason this game has been able to keep me playing it for so long is the multiplayer. It is a shame that the Steam page does not mention that there is a functional server which replaced the Gamespy server after it got shut down. Search up cnc online if you want to to make an account. What to say? A well balanced game, fast paced with epic battles. Highly recommended.			",25,1,0,4,1,0,13

												Edit :- All Online Features of this Game are no Longer in Service.Edit :- Working in Windows 10.If you're a fan of the Command & Conquer series, three small words are bound to get you excited: Kane is back. Indeed, so are a good number of beloved series hallmarks, like a huge amount of full-motion video and intense strategic combat. But Tiberium Wars is a lot more than just lip service to franchise enthusiasts, and you don't need the rose-hued glasses of nostalgia to appreciate its polish and intensity. It's simply a superb game that's fun and exciting to play both online and off.The missions themselves are incredibly varied and involve a lot more than destroying an enemy base or defending a particular structure. You'll have to do these things, of course, but you have both primary and secondary objectives to complete, which include using engineers to capture certain buildings, amassing beam cannons to take out defenses, or teaming up with your sworn enemy to defend against alien attack. You'll be doing it all in a variety of real-world theaters, such as Washington, DC, downtown Sydney, and the eerily dry Amazon basin. The near-future take on familiar locales makes the intense battles feel even more thrilling, because the settings are recognizable and meaningful.That's not to say the combat isn't gripping on its own. If you're usually content to turtle up in real-time strategy games, you're in for a surprise: Battles are intense and focused, and they give you little time to prepare. Like any RTS, you still need to build up resources, but it's a quick process of plopping down a bunch of tiberium refineries and power generators and finding the action, because if you don't, the action will quickly find you. Once you get past the first two acts of each campaign, you'll discover that Tiberium Wars' artificial intelligence is aggressive and resourceful, and it will take advantage of your strategic flaws. Don't expect to put your trust in one or two favored units, because even the most powerful units have noticeable weaknesses.It's a rusher's paradise, but you shouldn't take it to mean that technological advancement and thoughtful strategy don't have their places. You won't need to deal with long, complex tech trees, and it makes Tiberium Wars feel somewhat limited in this aspect next to advancement-focused strategy games like Supreme Commander. However, you do have multiple powers and upgrades to earn by building various structures. The powers run the gamut from GDI's powerful ion strike to Nod's vapor bomb, and they fit each faction perfectly. As you use units they level up, making them more effective in battle, and in some cases you improve units by more unconventional means. For example, you can use a Nod warmech to destroy your own flame tank, and the mech will then spew fire in addition to its own native attack.How differently each faction plays is impressive, especially with the new Scrin faction added to the mix. GDI units tend to be straightforward and powerful, and a huge force of mammoth tanks and juggernauts is a challenge to counter. Nod relies on sneakiness and smart use of unique abilities, and a small force of stealth tanks and viper bombers can cripple an enemy's economy. But playing as the Scrin is Tiberium Wars' greatest delight and challenge, since the alien faction is so different from the others. Your first encounters with the Scrin in the campaign are breathtaking, since even low-level units like buzzers look interesting and intimidating. In fact, the most threatening sight within the game is a fleet of Scrin assault carriers and their accompanying fighters. Yet while the Scrin have some potent units and other advantages, such as the ability to collect endless tiberium without building silos, they require a lot of micromanagement and intimate knowledge of each unit and structure.Regardless of your history with Kane and his cohorts, Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is one of the finest real-time strategy games in years. It's also a triumphant return to form for the series, because it's more than just a graphical update--it's an exciting, well-tuned experience with enough that's old and enough that's new to thrill old-timers and newcomers alike. Suffice it to say, you should play this game, and expect to be playing it for a long time to come.			",149,6,8,6,1,0,11

												The year is 2045. World is almost completelly infested with a strange, green substance, called Tiberium. This ""thing"" dropped down on Earth in 1990, and hell yeah, Earth will remember that day forever. Clearly an alien in origin, Tiberium (or Ichor - this is probably it's real name, given that the Scrins called it this way) has a very unlikely structure, and two very important abilities - 1st, it converts everything it touches, into itself, 2nd, its kind off... living. It is evolving. On Earth, there are those, who want to get rid of this thing. And also those, who can claim it, worship it, and use it, maybe for greater good. These two sides can not go side by side. Thus - they are at an apocalyptic war across the entire planet !This game, released in 2007, is still awesome. Yesterday, I was able to play it in Ultra High grafics with 3rd level AA - and I must say, this one still packs some power. Still amazingly smooth, still looking good. I like the story - and also cutscenes. Well, they could have been better, but this is no movie, this is just a game. And for a game, I can give those cutscenes 7/10. Textures are amazing, 8/10, but then you will see Scrins and you will have to give another point. Sounds are also very great, 8.5/10. Music is amazing, 9.5/10, it is not the best in the world, but it is very fiting and adictive. Also mechanics, those are great as well. You have to consider at this point, that the game is 7 years old already, and back there... You know, technology and also programming went up. I still remmember how long I waited, together with my brother, to get this one in hand. I was 17 years old when it came out - and our poor old PC (2.4GHz Celeron - ONE core, 0.75GB RAM DDR2, and 0.5GB graphic card) can run it only on the lowest settings. But still, when I saw Mammoth tanks, Avatars and Tripods on one screen - hell yeah baby. I knew, that I will love this game one day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ignore my hours. I had this game on disk since it first came out, and honestly, its had more time put into it than any of my other strategy games put together.When Westwood still existed the C&C series always were wonderful to play - There was just that touch of polish and care which went into their games that you didn't quite get with others, even right down to the little animations of the commandos lighting a cigerrette and chucking it aside, quoting one of their infamous lines with a chuckle. So for 2D units  you were commanding quite a colourful and unique army.However when C&C3 came along... Oohh boy, that jump into 3D. It brought fresh life to the series!... too bad it was the last 'good' game beyond Red Alert 3 after that. EA had washed everything 'Westwood' down the drain.As always the three factions are almost brilliantly balanced; They each have strengths and flaws which play a triangular role against one another, with similar but unique powers and tech trees. While they can be infamous for certain reasons - Scrin with their hordes of alien ships for example - there is no reason why a player cannot use either GDI or NOD to the same extent and counter it. From the previous two games the missions are also once again varied, can last you a while, and the AI can be dubious when you're unprepared (if not a little clumsy here or there) which means you can get quite a few hours out of Skirmish mode.-- Edit --Unfortunately however these days the game's multiplayer has all but dissolved. I think there is still a small community and you might still be able to play matches, though its rare and you're going to have to go out and find it. Despite this I still enjoy playing the game and its Kanes Wrath expansion as a time waster and fond memory of the good times I had with it.--Like I said. Sad to see its the last 'good' game of the series.Command & Conquer 4 'Twilight' ruined the finale to the story by ripping out the core gameplay mechanics, making maps capture-the-flag esque and point control, while plummeting the player into a final 'thats all folks!' with the ending.If you want a true C&C game, get Tiberum Dawn or Sun. If you want an enjoyable 3d C&C game, get this, or Red Alert 3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium wars is one of my favorite games of my childhood and still continues on 8 years later into my adulthood. Being the first and best RTS games I ever played (originally I played it on Xbox 360 first as the demo when it came out and later the full copy). Here is why it's awesome. The Single Player Campaign (SPOILERS): This game has some fun RTS gameplay and a awesome story that has continued the Tiberium universe in this epic story from the GDI, NOD and Scrin sides. The story culminates into one arch with Kane's goal of Ascension, GDI's goal of stopping tiberium and the new faction the Scrin to take tiberium from Earth. As you play, you get high-quality cut-scenes. EA did a very good job of putting a good budget for the cut-scenes qualities and actors. Notable actors that play in the stories characters are Michael Ironside as Jack Granger, Jennifer Morrison as Kirce James and of course Joe Kucan as Kane. The high-production quality of the cut-scene alone is a damn good reason to play the campaign. The missions on the other hand though are...FANTASTIC! Great missions both challenging and interesting in their own ways. Most of them can be beat though through simple strategies (such as spam), others are very hard and require tactics and strategies to complete the objective. The intel you get throughout the campaign is quite fun to collect and read (you get the intel through completing the missions main and bonus objectives). Other notable things about the campaign that I enjoy is the small ""Establishing Video Uplink"" in-game cutscenes in the top right-hand corner uplink feel like you're actually being talked to while you prepare for battle. Ultimately outside of the great acting, lore and missions the game has a unique universe that makes it great for the players as you shape it as you play through this fun and amazing campaign. Skirmish and Multiplayer: The skirmish and multiplayer for this game is quite fun. This is the 2nd primary reason you should get this game. Battling against enemy AI's is quite fun when you are alone and then going to multiplayer to survive against a brutal AI with friends is VERY fun. Battling against each-other is very enjoyable and requires skills either out-tech your opponent quickly (if you are GDI) or out-maneuver them through stealth and hit and run tactics as NOD. For the Scrin, simple air spam. (xD) The games can last for around 30 minutes to a hour at most depending on the AI you are going against or player. Other things to note is the lack of official servers for Tiberium Wars, I suggest using evolve or C&C Online if you plan to play with friends or regular players. Overall, its a great time to slug it out and annihilate each other in a war to end all wars game. Maps, Graphics and Performance: This games map designs and graphics blend beautifully to make a wonderful looking tiberium-infested world. From battling in Egypt to Small Town USA, their are many maps types and many ways you can use these maps to your advantage for your faction. On maps you will notice Tech buildings. The different type of tech buildings are... -Tiberium spike Provides an initial bonus and then a constant stream of funds.-Mutant hovel Allows recruiting of Mutant Marauders.-Expansion Point Provides additional ground control.-Subway Hub Provides control over Subway entrances.-Subway Entrance Allow infantry to transfer between entrances.-Tiberium silo Provides a one-time bonus to the first player who captures it.-Reinforcement bay Provides reinforcements.(Campaign only)-EMP control center Allows the launch of an Electromagnetic Pulse at regular intervals. As such straight from the cnc.wiki, the tech buildings allow a side to get a advantage over the other with these buildings using a engineer. They are pretty straight forward as the descriptions say above. But to continue with the graphics, the game looks fantastic. Maxing out all the settings and looking at the eye candy that comes aftward while building your base or leveling someone else's' is quite beautiful. The fidelity and visuals make the game look very wonderful compared to its previous title (Tiberium Sun) and allow the player to have visually stimulating good time. Performance wise, this game runs pretty good. 30 frame cap can be a issue for some, but it rarely dips below that while in-game as battles are usually short and decisive. If you have a decent computer (with at least 8 gigs of ram, a GTX750 or a AMD R7, you will be fine). If you have a gaming computer, prepare for max graphic and no lag. (Outside of that stupid frame cap) Mods: The modding community has kept this game alive and well for many years since its release. With mods that bring back old Tiberium Sun units and Structures or do crazy stuff with Chuck Norris, you will enjoy playing the mods made by the Community. But to be more specific, I will list the categories and links to the mods I most enjoy and you should check out! (Total Conversation)Tiberium Esssense: http://www.moddb.com/mods/tiberium-essence(Total Conversation) CNC Fallout: http://www.moddb.com/mods/cnc-fallout (Crazy) The Chuck Norris Experience: http://www.moddb.com/mods/cc3-the-chuck-norris-experience(Total Conversation) Tiberian Sun Redux: http://www.moddb.com/mods/tiberian-sun(New Faction) The Forgotten: http://www.moddb.com/mods/cc-3-the-forgotten(Total Converstion) Command and Conquer: Tiberian History: http://www.moddb.com/mods/command-conquer-tiberian-history(Total Conversation) Dune: http://www.moddb.com/mods/dark2113(Total Conversation) Halo: Evoultions: http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-evolutionsWhat I really enjoy about this Modding community is the amount of successful and awesome total conversation mods that bring back many old units from previous games and make them better with the newer engine. I also enjoy the mods that bring in other universes to the engine. My favorite of all of those has to be Tiberium Essence (Sorry Chuck) as it brings some wonderful units and buildings from Tiberian Sun. The mod also does well of improving some of the Units such as the Mammoth Mk2, as its Rocket Pods and Gun turret now actually function and are effective in battle. Also a upgrade on it allows either duel grande launcher turret (to kill enemy infantry in buildings more effectively or clear buildings of enemy infantry) or a Anti-Aircraft duel-railgun turret for shooting down most aircraft with ease. I also been following the mod for years and it has a wonderful developer, community and always more content on the way! The next update will contain The forgotten Faction (Also sorry Forgotten Mod). To get off my box now on my favorite mod, please check out all those mods their, to install a mod and get it to work on steam, make sure you create a Mod folder in Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars folder that should be found in My Documents (You should also see another folder called replays, if you see that, your in the right place). Make sure [Mods] is spelled exactly like that without the brackets. After you make the mod folder, throw the mod into the Mods folder (make sure you have winrar to extract the mod, most mods use a rar file) and then go to your steam library. Right click on Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars in your Steam Library, click Properties, make sure your in the GENERAL tab and click on Set Launch Options. You should see a box come up with a blank text box. Type in the text box [-ui] (without brackets). (DASH_SPACE_LOWERCASEUI)Now the Game browser will appear! Select a mod & play! Overall, Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is a great game. Fantastic single player campaigns, great skirmish and multiplayer modes, wonderful maps, graphics and good performance. I Highly recommended it if you are a true RTS fan and honestly, this is the last best Command and Conquer game (including Kane's Wrath).			",170,10,2,9,44,0,78

												First things first. This and the expansion kanes wrath are sadly the last good c&c to ever be made. EA killed the franchise and i still weep manly tears to this day about it.Second on my list is simply this. If you can beat the campaigns you are clearly ♥♥♥♥ing jesus and I raise my glass to your deeds. ♥♥♥♥ croatia and the late nod missions.Third and final. This game is just fantastic for an easy RTS experience that doesnt take a lot to learn. Just play it. You will love it.PEACE THROUGH POWER			",44,1,0,6,5,0,18

												One of the last good Command and Conquer games. Do not get me wrong, all the story line of the Tiberium series was good up until the shocking twist in which Kane goes from terrorist cult leader to savior of himanity. This game is full of fun and challenging missions. Even easy, suprisingly, gives even a veteran CnC player like myself, who has played CnC since age 5 (12 years ago) a rough time. And for those who dont know whats in store.....your not only worrying about your factions nemesis....also to avoid spoilers, dont play skirmish or multiplayer. Heres my opinions on the game:My Star Rating: 4.5Good things:1) Evolution of CnC base building and expansion2) Adding a new foe3) Change in difficulty4) Referances many things in the past, including Humvees, Titans, Wolverines, TW2 and occasional TW1 buildings that litter some later battlefields. 5) Turned the commando into a faction specific unit, one being a bad♥♥♥♥♥demolitions expert, and other is a smoking hot red head. Bad Things:1) Replaced the well beloved corny and crappy acting I loved to see with professional acting.Well worth the money!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of my personal favourites as their is a great selection of special abilities each faction has which if you use correctly, will change the tides of the battle. I hate the fact that wall construction was removed, spotlights back at Tiberium sun and other majestic buildings in firestorm/ Tiberium sun. Still ♥♥♥♥ you EA For the♥♥♥♥♥♥sexual and ending to the Tiberium franchise that we all know and hate, except for that one kid in this current generation that says ""Better then the previous titles, probably more better than Generals"" If you ever encounter that kid, punch him in the nuts and say, ♥♥♥♥ you. I enjoyed the game, bought it 5 times with dlc for friends cause there is a way to revive the multiplayer use a site called Revora C&C and download the online multiplayer hooking tool thing that launches with your game, after you click the play button on steam press the game you selected and play, you will require an account from their site. And there is a tool called Gentool which I think Should revive multiplayer for generals.			",146,12,4,10,19,1,14

												With 200+ hours on this account for this game; I'll make it quicker than I want it to be and I'll be providing a TL;DR at the bottom.This game is beautiful. No, not just because of the graphics since that does not make a game great. I'll admit that being made in 2007: the graphics do hold very well to this very day. I'm talking about how the game feels to play, how much lore that you can unfold in this game and a very important point I will bring up later on.The game itself is very easy to pick up and learn the basics such as what units do what, what your base does and many other things. As you progress through the story; you'll meet bonus objectives that you can complete for a different medal at the end (great for you completionists). The campaigns can have some very challenging moments for newer players but it will make you do what you're supposed to do: Come up with a strategy to win.Notice that I said campaigns. You can play the GDI (Global Defense Initiative), NOD campaign and a short Scrin campaign. The last being unlocked once you have completed both of the other two campaigns.This game supports free building (allowing you to build almost anywhere on the map except impassable terrain), there is no unit limit and there is some decent to good balance in this game.Now, onto that point I mentioned earlier: It's the community. The C&C community has been part of me throughout my childhood and still is. People have constantly pushed out custom maps that have gamemodes for them such as No money, Art of Defense and Comp stomp. Command and Conquer Generals was my introduction to the community but not the series and I'm glad to see how much it has flourished. If you wish to play this game online: Look into C&C Online. It's a community project that provides players to connect to their servers to play online so you can play with your friends or strangers. Downloading and installing custom maps is incredibly easy to do and can provide you more enjoyment in this game.Now, here's another important piece of the community: Mods. There are tonnes of them that bring things from the older games or whatever the team behind the mod wanted. I've played dozens upon dozens of mods and because of that; this game has continued to be something I love to play and relax with. TL;DR: I love this game and if you're wondering that if it is worth your time and money; I hope you do pick this amazing game up. This game has good replayability with custom maps and mods that you can find via Google.Needless to say that this C&C fan will be giving this game a 10/10.			",56,1,4,4,2,0,8

Posted: October 9, 2015
												This is my first review so im glad I picked one of my favorite games to start off with (be warned its long, so if you want to skip to the end it sums up the review) . My hours don't do it justice but rest assured, I had this game for both PS3 and Xbox before buying it once again on Steam (Yes, I loved it that much, also theres no limit on units which is so much better than being capped on consoles). This game will never be RTS game that sets the bar for all other RTS style games, far from it, BUT, this is infact one of the best RTS games around nowadays. Firstly, you get THREE campaigns for three different factions, each with a very unique style. GDI which is basically your standard army relying on highly advanced tech to destroy your enemies *cough* Mammoth tanks OP *cough* . Then there is NOD (All hail Kane!), arguabley the one that takes the most skill, as you are usually going to end up using stealth units or surprise kamikaze runs in order to halt your more advanced enemies. They may not pack the biggest punch, but they have a really mean defense system which is every turtles dream and every player who likes to steamroll's nightmare. Then there is Scrin, take the ships from Stargate Atlantis and Independence day, throw in some Tripods from War of the worlds and some menacing alien-infantry and you have one of the most OP factions in any RTS ever. All campaigns are great and all have replay value, and trust me, when the difficulty is on hard, you will need an act of god to save you for almost every mission. All and all, the campaigns are really good and all are essentially a tutorial in some way for Skirmish mode. Straight to the point, Skirmish mode is your standard Team Deathmatch, you can do anything between 1v1 to 4v4, or if you want to be a god do a 1v7. Now lets talk about the cons. One of the biggest problems in the game is MASSING, in order words, spamming the same unit over and over cause you can't be bothered to use some real strategy and want to steam roll every skirmish or mission. Whether its creating a moving fortress of 20 Mammoth tanks, swarming the skies with 1000 (slight exageration) Venoms or just flat out crucifying everything in your path with some Scrin aircraft or tripods, if you want to mass, this is your game. However, there is an amazing array of different units with different abilities that the AI uses to its full potential and it takes quite a bit of skill to combat it, try to experiment with different units, massing isn't fun. Next con is the difficulty system. Easy is too easy, its a curbstomp and its the setting you'd use to teach your little sibling how to play. Medium/Normal is a step up but after a few games you should be fine although you can't 1v2 or 1v3 against Medium AI's. Then theres Hard/Brutal, whatever hate-induced state the developers were on when they made this setting, they wanted you to lose. Its nearly impossible to take down a Brutal opponent, it took myself and 2 other friends about 40 minutes to kill a Brutal enemy AI, its honestly that hard unless you mass/turtle. If you like a challenge, this is were you get one. I once did two Brutal AI vs myself and five mediums, after 10 minutes three of my allies were dead and we only won cause I turtled and spammed the super weapons.Lastly the multiplayer servers are down, there is some fan-supported servers around but the official ones are down (♥♥♥♥ YOU EA).So heres the summary, if you want a game for really good campaign and endless amounts of fun with Skirmishes, this is worth it. Avoid massing for a real challenge and use the Mothership to wipe out the whole map if you want to end the map with a bang, pun intended.8/10. KANE LIVES.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great Strategy Game. Get this instead of C&C4 unless like a strategy game without typical base building. Eaach 3 factions have their strengths and weakness'. Hints: If Nod your more gureilla warfarish in a way. GDI is actually very balanced and can specialize in any play style, good for starters. Scrin is... complicated, they have a nice mix air superiority while being able to take down infantry fast and easily. If versing Scrin keep your Infantry out and buildings and as more of a backup force to deal with other vehicles, fighters, and AT infantry.			",40,4,0,11,18,0,29

												Aliens? Hell yeah! Up until this game it was all about the GDI and NOD forces pitted against one another. Someone at EA thought they could just include a new race and that is what they did. Considering EA developed this it is understandable that there were no issues with production value. The graphics at the time were top notch and once again the cutscenes have famous actors (e.g. Michael Ironside).Finally, ""building"" soldiers does not happen one-by-one but instead this is now squad-based. You recruit squads and the good-old level-up feature from previous games were kept so the longer a squad survives the better it'll become. Also, upgrades are now important to add new features to the units. I liked how this was brought over from Generals.We have a long and decent campaign with an interesting story. And this cannot be a true command and conquer game without Kane who also returns. You have some ingame database that helps you with the story-telling and entries are given once you complete sidequests within missions. Another likeable concept.All in all, this is a decent follow-up to an already famous and successful franchise. I never liked Tiberian Sun but Tiberium Wars made me like this franchise again.

												One of my favourite games of all time. Not only was it a absolute blast back when it came out it is still one of the best real time strategy games made to date.First of all, the three sided campaign is masterfully made with a great story and fun missions to back it up, it’s not just a campaign you will love the first time around but for many many more playthroughs. The live-action cut scenes work amazingly and really draw you into the universe that was made in the earlier games. Not only where they well-made but well-acted too and with a well-known cast aswell.The game play is fluid and fun, with a user interface that is easy to get used to and fast to use, it's easy to command your armies and produce new units on the fly. The three factions are well balanced, each with their own unique strengths and weakness like GDI’s slow moving but hard punching pace and Nods quick guerrilla war hit and run tactics. This gives each faction a real reason why you should play them and not just a simple reskin with a few different abilities.If you get a few friends the game really shines, from massive wars with brutal AI’s to making the best defended base you can while keeping the enemy locked away on one side of the map its really a blast.It also has a great modding scene! With mods like  tiberium-essence which brings in units from the older games,  the forgotten , a completely new campaign that is well made with its own life-action cut scenes as well and many many more, some still being made to this date, there is definitely plenty to do!Not only this but they are many new maps to download and a great although hard to get working map editor.All in all if you like real time strategy games I can’t stress enough how much you should try this game and I doubt you will be disappointed, and with prices being so cheap here on steam and on Origin it’s a game you can have many hours of fun on without hurting the wallet.

No... not Johny Walker... I mean Mechs.- A walk in the Tiberium field (Make sure to get health check after the stroll, please)- Levelling-up your units... Seriously... they become Veterans... Or Aces... Even your MCV can...- Sending your opponents' units hurtling into a Black Hole... On Earth.- LOL as you gang-up upon a defenseless Construction Yard (with 100 units of your Riflemen or Militant Squad)- ............ Alien. Did I forget to mention an alien faction?Just ... buy this.

												       This is a good game, but I have noticed several things I did not like. It's not that the game is really lacking but it was less than I had expected. The maps are smaller and defensive capabilities are really limited. This is alright if you really like small maps with constant intense combat. Also considering that infantry is setup to take cover against buildings and line of sight is important the fact that formations are missing seems like an oversight. There are some things lacking from previous editions as well, for instance nod laser fences. Overall, the price is right for what you get but don't expect everything that came with C&C.

												I am a grown up father and it is incredible how satisfying playing this game still is. Considering the age, the game holds up more than just well. The graphics are very good. The gameplay is almost perfect, awesome campaign, everything works out just fine. If you played C&C from the beginning of the series, you'll have a heartwarming, familiar feeling, as if you just met your old friend from schooldays. I own every single c&c game except the last one. (I spared me the pain :) ) This is together with Generals and Red Alert 2 my favourite game of the series. If you want RTS, base building, creating an army big as ... and steamroll your enemies, look no further, this game is it.If you are an old fart like me, and want to feel young and forget your aching joints for a while, grab this game and feel good. EA games, It's in the game! (At least is was back then, no DLC, no microtransactions and a wellmade game.)			",276,68,6,48,22,3,68

												Command and Conquer is a legendary franchise that is much beloved by people all over the world. A franchise that unfortunately has remained dormant for some time and most likely will continue to do so. But most of the games contained within it are extremely great, and this one is no exception.C&C 3 takes place in the Tiberium Wars arc that began with the original game. The world has prospered under the control of the GDI. A sort of United Nations military force, that combats terror threats. However, a quasi-religious cult known as the Brotherhood of Nod reappears to try and take control by force. The thing I like the most about Command and Conquer is it feels the closest to present day warfare compared to other RTS games such as Starcraft. It features a very well funded military symbolizing ""peace"" and ""order"" against an anarchistic anti authoritarian movement. And the entire conflict revolves around the accumulation of a resource known as Tiberium.This also ties into the general gameplay of the series and this game in particular. In Command and Conquer there aren't any worker units and buildings are queued similar to units. Your units tend to be squads of footsoldiers, tanks, jet fighters and so forth. Even though it is a very sci-fi game with aliens, lazer beams and so forth. It still feels much more down to earth. Infantry units die very quickly to units carrying rifles, but are useless against buildings and vehicles. Wheras vehicles have lots of health and can carry other units but are weak against explosives. It's a game where you have to pay very close attention to what units you're controlling and which ones are attacking which. C&C 3 in particular takes a few cues from other RTS games like Starcraft. It adds an alien race known as the ""Scrin"". Who have their own unlockable campaign. Although there are very few surprises when playing as the Scrin, they queue their units the same and their buildings are mostly similar. But there are statistical differences to playing it. Which unfortunately only become really prominent at higher levels of play. My favorite aspect of C&C 3 in particular is it's skirmish mode. Specifically how customizeable it is. You can set a particular AI opponent to have different mannerisms. Like you can set an AI opponent to turtle, meaning staying in his base and preferring to not attack. Or you can set an AI opponent to be a rusher, who will attack at the soonest moment. It's one of my favorite RTS games to play exclusively in singleplayer for this reason. Multiplayer is also available however you will need to use third party methods to get connected as it ran on Gamespy which has been shut down.Solid RTS, one of my favorites. Easily recommended if you're a fan of campaign and skirmish.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												Great game, after so many years I still enjoy this game. It is worth purchase! It aged nicely, still one of best strategy games out on the market. In the game there are some actors who acted in Battlestar Galactica, Lost and Starship Troopers. 1000/10			",109,14,7,9,4,2,14

												1995... A game named Command and Conquer appeared... and paved the way for an entire genre. It's a name that many RTS veterans should be familiar with. The franchise had its ups and downs throughout the years. 2007, the long awaited sequel of Command and Conquer Tiberian Sun appears. Has it passed the test? Let's see...Visually, the game is downright gorgeous, even for today's standards. You can tell at first glance, whether the map is situated in a still pristine Blue zone, a conflict-torn Yellow zone or in an almost unearthly Red zone. The units are also well designed and their appearance alone tells something about the respective faction. Topped off with non-excessive and neat special effects, the visuals give a good impression.Gameplaywise, the game has undergone major changes. Instead of one single build queue, where the amount of respective facilities only determined production speed, now each production facility has its own queue, and units have gained special abilities. These changes were not wellcomed by all fans of the franchise, but I'll allow myself to use a proverb: ""I don't know if it's going to be good, but if it is to become better, it must change"". Other than that, the ""hard-counter"" unit-system has finally reached a desireable level, unlike in previous titles, pretty much every unit can be put to a good use and has its weak points. Not every change is good though. The gameplay is kind of too fast-paced compared to its precedetors, and that signifficantly weakened the efficiency of commando-infiltrations, which were the brandmark of this franchise. Command and Conquer 3 lets you deploy a countermeasure in a matter of seconds, leaving little to no room for a classic commando rampage, which was possibly the most fun thing Command and Conquer could offer. That aside, the gameplay gets way more than a passing grade. The audio: The first thing C&C fans will notice that the OST simply doesn't have the same magic as the ones composed by Frank Klepacki. Just thinking of ""March to doom"" playing as you scrape together leftovers of your army in late-game for a final desperate attempt to win sends chills down my spine. Still, the soundtrack is by no means bad. The sound effects are seamlessly implemented, and is good and bad at the same time. Remember how your hands started sweating when you hear the ominous thundering sound of the allied Cruiser's cannons in Red Alert? It was the sound saying: ""say goodbye to your base"". On the other hand, with the sound effects not standing out too much, you can keep being fully focused on the events on the battlefield and can clearly make out the very important and helpful announcements of your EVA unit, pointing out upcoming danger.Despite all the flaws pointed out, Command and Conquer 3 Tiberian Wars is a very enjoyable game and I recommend it to both newcommers and veterans. Verdict: 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was my childhood, picked it up on disc when i was just 11 years old in 2007 about 9 years ago, purchased it for a tenner on steam which made it a lot easier to play online. I also recommend everyone picks up the Kane's Wrath expansion which introduces 6 new factions.pros - The live acting is not as cringy as it was in the red alert games, the story feels much more serious here.-  Each mission in all 3 campaigns can be very challenging especially near the end of the campaigns, theres always a wide variety of objectives to complete- The environments look awesome with different weather conditions, wartorn streets and abandoned bunkers ect- The units can earn promotions, once they hit the max rank they can even regenerate their health without being repaired- The alien faction known as Scrin has an awesome campaign filled with destruction-  Each unit has a cat and mouse situation but because there is such a wide variety of them it does not matter as muchcons- Windows 10 cannot run this game for most players for some reason so be aware you may need to downgrade- Sometimes the AI uses a lot less tactics on the harder difficulty and just spams a mixture of units over and over again which can get frustrating Overall tiberium wars 3 gets a 10/10 its by far one of the best command and conquer games and is my personal most favourite real time strategy game of all time			",149,23,0,19,12,0,38

												One of the greatest RTS's I've ever played, with a superb story, good voice acting, and just overall fun gameplay with the base building and resource gathering.The three factions are:The Global Defense Intitative (the ""good guys"", protectors of the Earth, etc.)The Nod (religious fanatics with flamethrowers)The Scrin (the overpowered aliens that bring doom to everything they ♥♥♥♥ing touch)10/10 would recommend to people who like RTS.

https://cnc-online.net/en/ for online play. Servers are a bit dead and I wish more would play this game. A very awesome strategy game and a victory feels very rewarding. My first computer game I ever played was C&C Tiberian Sun. I still like the first but cannot play that old game online. Scrin was added which is a very fun alternative to NOD and GDI. The game is balanced if you know what to do. Scrin is air, GDI is ground, NOD is a mix (and the cloaking harvesters help as well).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm doing this for the badge but at the same time I'll be writing some things about this game.General information:Command and Conquer 3 is a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game that offers multiplayer and single player mode. Sadly, multiplayer is down and will no longer be up forever (that's what I know). There is still a way using certain apps like hamachi to do so but it's not public anymore. Content:There are many great maps from basic trainings to precision timings in the campaign. There are also skirmish maps that can be used for the multiplayer mode or practicing your skill with AI. The units in the game has a lot of different variety from infantries, vehicles, and aircrafts. These units are also splited into 3 different factions with different play style. Overall, the content for campaign is great if you compare with the expansion pack (Command and Conquer 3: Kane's wrath), but the units varies a lot more in the expansion pack. I forgot to mention that there are custom maps and mods in the game too.Quality:Can't say a lot of things about this, the game was created in 2007 and the expansion 2008. It actually is categorized to be a great quality during those years. For quality about gamplay, the units are balanced and are well executed in the game. Sometimes they might bug out under the map or not following certain commands but it happens quite rare. The quality for the genre RTS fits perfectly.Weaknesses (downsides):- There are no more updates to this game except community updates which are rarely seen. - Multiplayer needs friends that you know since it's impossible to connect randomly to a person. Sequels are dead/ruined (Command and Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight). - After researching a bit in the game, Brutal AI is somewhat cheating for the economy because of its unstoppable economy even when there are no tiberiums left on his field. But if you are looking for a challenge, this AI is for you. - Not a lot of skirmish maps other than community made maps- Problems with certain OS like windows 10, windows 8.1, ectThe Conclusion:This game was made about 10 years ago, so it's not perfect and even games these days are not perfect. The price is really not that worth it, I recommend you to wait for sale. The game, based on what I see, is rated 9/10.Some stuffs:- The campaign can be really challenging in hard mode- There is a level editor for the game, unfortunately steam version has some problems with it. There is a fix but I'm not sure if it works for all users- There is a fix to the crashing problems in on windows 10 and other stuff- The best RTS that I've ever played in my life, might be replaced but this will always be somewhere in my heart :). The game changed the way I think, more strategic certainly.- The expansion pack has a server where you'll be able to go online and play matches with people around the world. It also has tournaments (sometimes/rarely) and some updates.Final bits: I talk about the expansion in this review because it still has potential on reviving the game, but I prefer missions  and co-op (no co-op, just my style) so I write it down here.

												My first Tiberium game. After playing another modern C&C game, which is Red Alert 3, what can i say about this one. It good!. Seriously. Maybe i forgot how it was in old er games, but RA3 is all about humor and simple gameplay. Very simple strategy game. I love serious strategy games like Total War series. Red Alert 3 was too stereotypical and had easy AI. Not a bad game overall.Tiberium Wars on the other hand has good AI for such ""simple"" strategy genre. Campaign was hard even on Easy difficulty. AI won`t be shy to attack you. Big army is a common thing in TW. By big i mean bigger than 4 soldiers and 2 tanks as in RA3. Speaking of humor. This game is serious. Like RA 3 for kids and TW for adults. Just joking. Many cutscenes, but ending is short. 2 ""parts"" of faction missions. If you played as GDI, once you finished missions where Nod is your enemy, you will start another ""campaign"" where Scrin invaded Earth. It`s the same campaign technically, but your war now is not against old enemy, but against alien threat.More realistic vehicles design than in RA3. Infantry is now group of soldiers, instead of single soldier. That is all, i think. If you like WW2 factions, humor, stereotypes and crazy unit design (bears, dolphins) - Get Red Alert 3.If you like serious games, less cartoonish units, balanced AI - Get Tiberium Wars.

												Still the most excellent game of this series! Three factions with (functionally, not just cosmetically!) different units and strategies, three straight forward, but interesting plot lines, featuring cut scenes with esteemed actors, very engaging action and most satisfying explosions...Also, it is very stable on Windows 10. So far, I did not have a single crash. The only thing that is annoying at times is the dull AI. But then, they are soldiers, right?Highly recommended!			",114,28,1,38,22,0,33

												Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars keeps to the roots of the C&C genre in terms of base building, unit construction, and faction diversity. Minor changes are resource generation (Pre determined pools of tiberium exist), the special abilities of the factions, and trying to keep your enemy from unit swarming you (good luck with that haha). This is possibly the last true C&C game to come from EA that retains much of the C&C core (don't get me wrong, the Red Alert, Generals, and Kane's Wrath timelines are fun to play as well, not to mention KW is a throwback to Tiberian Sun in a manner). C&C 3 is also fun because you actually get to duke it out in diverse areas and SOME important cities all around the globe.I strongly recommend this game to any 90's kid.  ",66,7,0,12,4,0,17

												Tiberium Wars is in a lot of ways, the last hurrah of the C&C franchise. It is the last of the games to really stay true to the formula that made the series so successful but it was also the last of the series that failed to innovate and that is something that hurt it.The great live action cutscenes make a return but instead of the wonderful b-movie quality of previous installments it is now little more than catwalk performances by semi-famous actors.The gameplay is the same as in previous installments, although there has been some technical advancement you will immediately become comfortable with it. The poor unit AI and the lack of certain utility units common in other games does become frustrating rather quickly.It is a good game if you liked the old C&C's in series but it is also a game that has become stagnant. A game that tries to innovate but fails every step of the way and although C&C will always hold a place in my heart, I am glad that the genre is advancing beyond it.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												A Real-Time Strategy game worth adding to your collection.In-depth, the gameplay value is solid good, and that being the same reaction I had nearly 10 years ago when this game was released. Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars really strikes a significant balance between all the aspects you'd expect in a Real-Time Strategy game. There's just so much unit chemistry you can discover in this game as well! The re-play values of campaigns are cool, but it's really the skirmishes that get this game rolling for me. Until now. And beyond.Personally, this is not a completely addictive game (which is perfect so I can better manage my time), but I gladly say it's a very welcoming game to play whenever you feel like it. Long story short: It's a good, long-living RTS game. Cheers!			",9,0,0,0,0,0,3

												A sci-fi RTS with a grotesque alien race. What more could one wish for?Awesomitude- Easy to learn and play- Alien faction- Just enough strategy to be super fun without having to commit to something more complex like the TW series- Has an alien faction- Very nice sound design in general- Did I mention the alien faction?- Crippling your enemies with a superweapon, then moving in with a vast (alien) army and thoroughly annihilating them- The awesomely cliche insectoid alien faction- None of the lag problems more modern RTS's tend to have- ALIENS!- Exploding things all over the screen- Aliens doing the explodingBadness- The live-action cutscenes don't have the best writing and some of the actors aren't so great- The campaign story is uber predictable- Incidental voice-acting suffers from the same problem as the cutscenes (""Down with GDI!"" ...seriously? You're a militant cult faction who very obviously wants GDI to go down and that's all you can think up?)- Fairly predictable AI (though several ""brains"" - balanced, turtle, rusher, etc. - make it a bit better)Rating (relative to the RTS genre): 8.644143 out of 10			",16,7,0,1,0,0,8

												This game is a classic yet still golden. There are 3 factions in the game which are, GDI the so-called ""US Military"", Nod a rebellious group, and Scrin an alien group. My favorite is Nod due to the fact that you can launch nukes and special forces. I'm recommending this game also because the price isn't bad and most of the buyers and satisfied about the game overall. Since the multiplayer in the game is shut down for me I use Evolve a LAN program similar to Hamachi but better.			",67,5,2,3,19,0,5

												One of the best RTS games. Enjoyable single player Campaign, the graphics and the quality of the cutscenes still holds up to today's standards - which is quite amazing considering this was released nearly 10 years ago.Played the campaign for the 4th time and still can't get bored with it. Even though the actors were not very convincing the atmosphere of the game is amazing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SOLVED! Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars AND Kane's Wrath not launching/working on Windows 10. after soo long trying to figure out some way to get the game to run on Windows 10, I FINALLY found a solution just when I was messing around in the display driver settings. First of all my laptop is the late 2016 Razer Blade with the GTX 1060 and Core i7 6700HQ. Okay here's how I got it to work on Windows 10, first, make sure the game is not running as an administrator and all the compatibility mode/settings are disabled, I know most people probably enabled these trying to get the game to work (including myself). Okay next, open settings, in the search bar type ""device manager"" then select it, next select ""display adaptors"" then ""Intel HD Graphics"" then go to ""driver"" and select ""Roll Back Driver..."" then just give it a minute, the screen may turn blue for a second or whatnot, and that's it! the game should run perfectly! you can adjust it to whatever graphics or resolution you want and you can use a dedicated GPU (if you have one). if this helped you please like this comment so others will see! :)			",16,3,7,1,2,0,6

												I played all the Command & Conquer series and tell you what is the best of all parts. There is another add-on ""Wrath of Kane"" where almost everything is new. In Tiberium Wars, I like that the plot is just awesome I went for NOD and GDI campaign and I really like this game. Then I began to settle in the "" battle."" By the way the multiplayer is very good. My friend and many times were cut by the grid. The coolest race I think that GSB and Screenshots. At GSB steep tanks well and normal planes. Normal Nodes have the aircraft ""invisible"" tanks and bad infantry is not very much. The Screens are great planes and tanks, but with infantry bad. In General this game does not come off. I advise you to play.			",91,10,0,4,12,0,16

It is still amasing graphicaly.+Amasing gameplay. Fun units that can be upgraded.+Lots of different ways to finish some missions.+One of the best RTS games ever released so far with StarCraft and AoE.+SPOILER : The 3rd race is incredibly well designed.-Some missions are way way too easy even in hard sadly!-30 FPS cap. Most certainly the only game i play with 30 FPS i usualy can't stand it but this game is my only exception.PS : Don't overlook my hours played on Steam as i already have it on DVD finished almost 100 times ;)PPS : I'm on windows10 and it works flawlessly, you just need to launch it one time, if it crash the very first time you installed it, just launch it again it should work!

												This is one of, if not my favourite game ever. The last great C&C game in my opinion (Red Alert 3 is ok). If you like RTS games, this is the game for you and by far the best one. Everything, from the atmosphere of the battlefields to the great graphics (Even for nowadays). Only problem is that it is limited to 30fps. In this game it doesn't really matter but 60fps+ is still super nice in every game. Buy the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the game!			",142,12,15,5,14,0,4

												It's a never ending circle. And I'm going to be really honest here.I've enjoyed this game when I was 7 years old and I still do to this day. The game's dynamics, graphics, gameplay and mechanics are amazing. There are so many ways of playing this game, doesn't matter how and what you do. But, of course, you have to think. Think fast and hard. When I'm sitting and have nothing better to do, I start to look at many games in my library. Always repeating the same words over and over again, that I have nothing to play. But seeing how C&C3:TW is just sitting there, begging for me to play it, I start to move my mouse on that ""PLAY"" button. I press it and get into it for more than an hour, without warning anyone that I'm going to play it, but hey, who cares and/or needs to know? And there I go. Skirmish with bots. You wanna say, that it isn't fun with bots? Wrong, it is. You can basically find and download variants of maps on the internet and try them out. You can try and play against Brutal, Hard and Medium bots, let some of them be your allies and/or enemies. Build up a base with lots of defences so that you won't screw things up and don't lose.Build up an army out of ground support units like the Rifleman Squads, Missile Squads, Predator Tanks etc. That's for GDI. Choose NOD for example: 10 Avatars, 6 OP Stealth Tanks, Beam Cannons and 2 Airfields with 8 Vertigo Bombers. And that is already a good and a powerful army that will kick♥♥♥♥♥ For GDI: 4-6 Mammoth Tanks, 4-6 Predator Tanks, 4 APCs with 2 Rifleman Squads and 2 Missile Squads inside the APCs and 4-8 Firehawks. Both armies will kick each others asses in seconds or minutes. If you're in deep and chosen a map with Tiberium Spikes, never fear. Capture it, build up defences (use a Surveyor for that) and start slowly farming resources from that Tiberium Spike. Yeah, I know, it's a pain in the butt and a very slow process, but you'll have to manage to succeed. What about the Scrins? They're good, but the Mothership for $5000 is too OP, so I don't recommend to use it instantly. Just wait until you start losing and use some air support to let the Mothership destroy just everything. One charge from that cannon and the enemy's base is lost, turned into sheds.I'm that kind of a person who likes to watch the battlefield from above. That's why it's called strategy, obviously (UPDT: No). I saved a lot of replays and I still watch them just to see how tanks, vehicles, air and ground units are turning into minced meat and start drowning into the ground. Seeing how 3 armies fight between each other, fight together against one or two armies, it's just a non-stop gameplay.My grade? I will always keep my solid 10 out of 10 on this game. I can't leave it nor delete it. It's mechanics and gameplay are just addictive, like a drug. The singleplayer campaign has an intresting and a very amazing story, although it's getting harder to beat the game starting from Croatia when playing as NOD or Alexandria as GDI. Strongly recommend.  UPDATE  Thanks to CNC3 World Builder, I can finally bring this game back to life for myself by building maps. And here's a thanks to EA for this. To all those owning this game and those who still think of picking it up, buy it. Buy and play it. You won't regret it. Maybe some day I'll upload my best maps to C&C3 Mod website and make it downloadable for you! Never forget such games, bring them back to life.For Kane!For The Brotherhood of NOD!Peace through Power!Kane lives in death!Kane is the messiah!			",106,13,0,7,8,0,7

												Hi everyone. This is basically one of the best rts games I've ever played. It has everything a good rts game needs in my opinion (as most of the previous C&C). You can build huge bases and you don't have a unit limit. AGAIN NO UNIT LIMIT. This is a must have for me :)You can upgrade your units and you can combine different units for different tactics. You can still buy this game nowdays cause the graphic is still good in my opinion. You can't use the original multiplayer anymore cause the servers are down. But there is a well working community project which you can join for free and play with or against others.It's making me that they killed the franchise. You won't find any remotly compareable rts game nowdays. Most of the are designed for short matches. Basically choose your units and rush in. Yay 10-15 minutes matches.I love to remember the old times where a good c&c session took 3-4 hours of fun and a lot of ups and downs on each side. Great times. Great Game. :)But it have fun and join the community project.			",72,2,1,9,2,0,15

												Tiberium Wars got the RTS games back on their feet for me, where I was long lost in FPS games. Three factions, in a dark, yet beautiful to the day, universe. The actors in the singleplayer campaign do their job well, and you even get the chance to choose between a good and a more evil way to go.The multiplayer was well balanced and is, besides what some of my local community think, really fast. And then there is even Kain in it.			",329,81,4,42,21,7,79

												Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars (C&C3) is a great real-time strategy (RTS) game that offers an interesting story in the singleplayer campaign. It is well worth a playthrough for all RTS fans with features like infantry, armor and aerial assaults. True to the classic C&C franchise, C&C3 features live-action cutscenes played by a few A and B list celebrities that we leave you smirking in your chair as you battle for control of Earth and, more importantly, for Tiberium!

												Amazing RTS game. Every decision you make matters, you have near infinite ways to decimate your opponent. All races feel balanced and play out different styles. It's the classic C&C/Red Alert strategy that we all know and love but amped up. Although multiplayer might not be as booming as it used to be you can buy it solely for the campaign. I have never been more immersed so deeply in a games story until I encountered C&C 3. It's honestly a great take on what would happen if humanity discovered an element with great potential like this. It's nice and lengthy but actually filled with content too, which is rare for most RTS'. TL;DR : Great RTS, phenomenal campaign, excellent gameplay.			",158,26,0,7,10,0,11

												If you like C&C you should like this game. It lives true to it's name and they introduce a new race/faction to play for. I have enjoyed playing skirmishes but I was sad to find out there is no more multiplayer because the servers are down. It appears you can play on LAN although I have not been able to try it.If it is on sale get it.If you love C&C single player or have LAN get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the last good Command and Conquer game.Ever since EA caused holocaust of your favorite games, this is a true survivor.God, the campaign is so edgy, its one in a life time experience.It worked just fine on Windows 10 and setting up servers took some time, but it was worth it.As a long fan of the building, defending, attacking strategy games this one is one of the best. 7/10 - would watch Michael Ironside play edgy general again.

												Works great on Windows 10! No Problems. Single player campaign is difficult. Nod & GDI appear to be balanced. Contols are easy to use (Right click feature utilized) Game stays true to its roots while pressing ahead. Also Unlike Red Alert 3 C&C 3 has a more military or serious appearance, where as Red Alert can be a bit cartoonish. Overall highly Recommend to any RTS fan especially if you like C&C.

Posted: July 14, 2016
												Disclaimer: I primarily played this game with a non steam copy.Jesus, this one brings back some memories. I remember actually being on the forums as this game progressed. I remember some of the EA forum members as well and all the drama that happened both from the forum members and the EA staff, like EAApoc being ""kidnapped"" by Nod to keep the third faction a secret, thus mysteriously EALAPredator made an appearance to take his place and he totally isn't the same guy behind the username. Regardless, I was too poor at the time to buy the game on release. I got it a bit later when it was $30 to buy the special edition thingy that came both with this and Kane's Wrath. With that said, I hold Command & Conquer series very dear to my heart. Red Alert 2 was probably one of my favorite games of all time for a long time... Hell, it probably still is. However, Command & Conquer Generals was a huge slap in the face to fans of the series. Command & Conquer Generals is a great strategy game, but it's an insult to the C&C fanbase to call Generals a Command & Conquer game, an even bigger insult to claim the whole series connects to Generals somehow (I bet EA doesn't make those claims anymore). EA has a history of not doing Command & Conquer series justice, especially today. I will say that this game, as well Kanes Wrath, is probably the LAST true Command & Conquer game with quality gameplay. The game is great. For any strategy gamer that is unfamiliar with C&C base building, it's simple. You have different factory types, just like any other strategy game, but you do not need any form of constructor unit to build structures. You have a construction yard, you build around the construction yard, you can no longer build structures if you lose said construction yard, etc. All the newer C&C games don't implement this any longer, which is a shame because that is what made this series so special. There is only a small handful that implements RTS in such a way, so it's strange for them to basically change the formula from being unique to being generic. With that ramble nonsense said, this game has proper C&C base building and it works great. It's fluent, it's easy to understand, it's great. What makes this different from the old school C&C games is it implements upgrades in a way similar to C&C Generals, which is great because it's much more flexible and clean unlike the older C&C titles that implements upgrades. The resources gathered in this game comes from a source that is typically never ending, making it necessary to take over strategic points on the battlefield. The maps design that comes with the game is generally well crafted, making it possible to attack enemies by multiple points. The great thing is how many maps you can download from the community using the ""World Builder"" tool, which is a map editor/creator. The only bad thing is how this game doesn't use workshop like it easily could. The single player campaign is great. It's not too cheesy, it's just good quality B-Movie material. The game has great live action scenes, which the C&C series is famous for, that tell a great story in a creative way. They're not directly telling a story, you are told a story by being given orders and playing the missions. Rarely, there's an exception to this chemistry, but it's a good system that worked well for all the other C&C games and is oddly pretty unique to C&C how it's implemented. Online is dead. However, when it was alive, it was good. You can still play LAN, which I'm sure you're aware can be used through programs like Tunggle or Hamachi. The gameplay is great with other players.The AI in the game is greatly challenging. It's fun to play against both humans and computers alike. Overall, the game is fantastic. Kane's Wrath is a great addon to consider if you enjoyed this one. Pros-Great single playerSimplistic and easy to learn gameplay, but rewarding to masterfast paced, fluent, and the battles are overwhelmingly satisfyinggreat variety in maps, especially with community based mapsCons-Not a whole lot of variety for playable faction choices such as sub factions (this is addressed in Kane's Wrath expansion)Online is dead, you'll have to use LAN$15 is pretty high for a game of this nature and ageReplayability for singleplayer is not overwhelmingly high8/10			",649,117,18,55,55,7,71

												This and the expansion, Kane's Wrath, have aged surprisingly well. The videos are silly in the best sense of the word. If they ever make an Oscar for video game actors, then the statue should look like Joe Kucan dressed as Kane. Mission design is varied, the campaigns the right length, even the graphics and voices look and sound good today. If you order a Flame Tank to attack, it actually says ""Purge them with flames!"" and I believe.			",153,47,0,24,9,1,36

												Westwood's name isn't on this title, but the game still holds it's own. A number of features from the previous C&C game, Tiberian Sun, are strangely absent from this one. However, in return, there are many new features to take their place. If you're feeling really nostalgic for the old hellhound and titan units, pick up Kane's Wrath as well to bring them back into the fight.The cutscenes are very high quality, the story is well done, and the gameplay is solid command & conquer with a number of spectacular effects such as destructible environments that are considerably more realistic and vast than they have been in the past games. There is also no more grid system - build wherever you want. And of course, the addition of a 3rd faction, the Scrin, makes it more enjoyable too.Pick this game up if you're a command & conquer fan. If you aren't however, I don't consider this the best place to start.			",280,35,7,24,85,3,94

												The direct sequel to Tiberian Sun and a great game of the whole C&C series. - Graphics still look pretty nice today measured against the age of the game. - Classic C&C gameplay in single player campaigns or multiplayer. - 3 Races are playable (NOD/GDI/Scrin) - as always the exotic race brings in some variety.- Just a few maps for the multiplayer (without Kane's Wrath expension)- No working online matchmaking, you need some third party program like gameranger or hamachiOn the store page it says you should disable UAC to get it running, it worked for me without doing this - still IMO it's a no-go to sell a game on steam that is not working correctly or might have incompatibilities.

C&C3 has three campaign modes with a neat story and lots of stuff to do while you try to save/destroy the world and Kane is as awesome as you heard he is. Tank rushing and turtling is still possible, but they are not the only ways to play here. C&C3 is also fairly cheap now if you want a new RTS to scratch that itch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game I bought the other day however Windows 10 has many issues running this game. The one i have a problem with is ""Fatal Error: Exception in Exception Handler"" issue. I understand by a little research Windows 10 does not allow SafeDisc/Securom DRM games to run due to security issues within the programing. These issues running the game has disappointed many fans that i have read about. Please if you wish to buy this game  or an other that may have Windows 10 issues running it consult someone or Steam support before purchase.2017 update: There is light at the end of the tunnel, Windows 10 updates now allows this game and a few others that have SafeDisc/Securom DRM encoding to play			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember playing this on disc with Windows XP. Graphics have always been great and the campaign is actually kinda hard. Crashes on Windows 10 only if i play against 7 AI in multiplayer. Played it for more than 2 years on disc and burnt the disc from playing it too much, so glad it's on Steam. :D So. Many. Memories.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story mode was great! It provided a challenge and an interesting story. There are 2 main campaigns with a hidden campaign mode. All the campaigns are great, but they do get repetitive at times.When I wanted to play some multiplayer, I found out that the servers were down. I had to go to the few websites that host servers for C&C3. Once I did that, I really got to get rekt.			",135,11,1,7,12,2,8

												This was the best C&C *single player and story wise* out of the franchise. Very well done how the story moves and interacts with the live-action cutscenes. The Westwood-era Command & Conquer always delivered on interesting characters, live-action cutscenes and stories featuring world powers, great wars and epic struggles. This episode is great on its own and even better if you already played the previous Tiberium Sun and Tiberium Dawn games. Do not, however, play Tiberium Twilight. It's probably better for you to assume the series ended here.			",80,7,1,17,8,2,29

												Would reccomend this if you're a C&C fan/collector this is by far one of the best games they've done and the best game for the Tiberium scene. There's three factions GDI, NOD and Scrin (aliens), the missions follow that classic live action look that C&C do, the story line is pretty decent and follows on from previous versions however if you start from here there's enough infomation to fill you in on any missing gaps. The graphics are pretty decent for it's age and still seem pleasing enough today, It was a shame they had to end the C&C collection with C&C4 the ruiner of the game.			",7,0,0,4,0,0,3

												This was one of the greatest Strategy games ever made along the other Command & Conquer.This game is well made, nice graphics for back then, the gameplay is great, the AI is in my opinion way too hard (brutal), In Generals Zero Hour, I could beat a brutal on 1v1 and being on a team of 4v4 brutal and win the game, In Command & Conquer 3/Kane's Wrath, on 1v1 I don't even try cause I know i will lose while on 4v4 my team is all dead and i'm alone fightning 4 brutal scrins team with thousand if not more of units...It's a great game for fans of Command & Conquer, Strategy games, of people who likes Aliens and also for people who like challenging games, like i said, difficulty wise, it is really hard, on easy, it's easy, on normal, it's okay while on brutal, it's just too much for me to handle.9/10			",972,203,71,193,128,3,223

												Great RTS, mediocre C&C game. Feels more like a reboot than a true sequel. Not happy with the way they ditched the macabre atmosphere and turned NOD into Al Qaeda. Too much post-9/11, not enough post-apocalypse. I mean, they explain it in the game, but it was a poor choice of story direction in my opinion (R.I.P. Westwood Studios.) Still, an enormously fun and intuitive experience that shouldn't be missed. The live-action cutscenes are awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best C&C games so far, I have to honestly say that this game is twice better than Starcraft 2 and trillion times better than Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm. I used to be a Starcraft player, but Blizzard ruined the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of every ♥♥♥♥ing thing. So I changed my perspective on RTS genre, Westwood Studios is the best RTS maker of all times.Their game may not be so competitve like Blizzard, but they are fast pace but FUN!Competitiveness ruined the gaming industry, where it aimed only for FUN. C&C Tiberium War in this case exceeds most of its predecessors by being either fun (spamming units) and competitive. The AI in this game is very excellent and harder than Starcraft 2. The first time I played the campaign at easy level, the bots beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. In the skirmish game, the bots if you chose Steamroller, they will roll over you if in easy level.Although the multiplayer is no longer supported by EA, you still can go to online forums and download software to help the multiplayer section.The game is best at:- Best cinematics (Blizzard looks cheesy, but Westwood looks serious)- Amazing actors- Stunning graphics- Great soundtrack- Large gamesize, it is beyond my expectation of previous games- Dangerous AIs, they simply focus on wiping your most dangerous units- Many special abilities- Challenging missions with many bonuses that hardly find in any RTS game- Best RTS Campaign of the decade (C&C games always pull me to be serious in watching briefing, tempting)- Great Balance system (This new C&C fixed the unit spamming in Red Alert 2)- Best modding community secondly after Skyrim Nexus (It composed of many foreigners, they are amazing)- Tiberium Essence! The best mod that made this game perfect, you need to download it on DB.Some flaws:- Many special abilities (Old Red Alert 2 is easier, this new thing is quite hard to use)- Chaotic graphic ( I feel the graphic is a little too oversaturated)- AIs are quite dumb at pathfinding- Still having some balancing flaws from the old C&C- Harvester!- Still no CABAL from Firestorm Crisis, I was waiting for an expansion on such amazing AI villain in video game history, yeah, ♥♥♥♥ EA.Score: 96/100Greatly Amazing, but underrated.Starcraft 2 should have been 78/100 instead of 91/100 on reviewing websites. Tiberium War just bought me back to the Command and Conquer franchise, let's hope there will be a fifth installment. ",5,0,0,5,0,0,4

												This is an awesome game in lots of ways, but it has 2-3 glaring flaws:- First off, while the story itself is very intelligent, the story dialogue borders on inane. It sounds like the actors are speaking to 15-year-olds. Maybe I'm too old for this game, but they involve a lot of ""teen angst"" into something as mature as warfare.- Secondly, the singleplayer missions are often pure guesswork. If you build the wrong type of unit in the beginning, you quickly lose, even on Easy. You often cannot know beforehand which attack is going to come when. To remedy that, the game can specify up to 10 mission objectives, which means you'll be following instructions like a zombie instead.- Thirdly, Ground Zero. Even when you cheat to give yourself 1 000 000 credits, it's still extremely hard.I recommend using money cheats (like ArtMoney) with this game, because the story is the best part.If you like this game, consider buying the Kane's Wrath expansion, as well as getting Tiberian Sun and its expansion, which should be free at this point.However, C&C4 employs a different playstyle altogether, so watch YouTube before buying C&C4.

												I have the retail DVD disk version of the game. I decided to buy the Steam version since it's on 75% sale. Cannot complain. The game is still fun. I highly recommend this game to any RTS fans out there. Plus the mods gives the game replayability.Game easily a 10 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has no life without the Tibeium Essence mod.If you own the game currently, seriously, get this mod. The game on it's own is a fantastic game, with major potential. I think my favourite strategy would be using raider buggies with camo, then making them EMP other units, before then releasing the avatars on the EMP'd vehicles.Campaign is bland as usual, don't expect anything merely ""Good"" there. 3/10I would rate it a 10/10 with tiberium essence, and a 6/10 without it. Simply, the game has amazing potential, and Tiberium Essence really brings it to life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Command and Conquer 3 returns to the GDI vs NOD setup of the original games and adds a third faction. The third faction, the Scrin, is a unique alien force only playable in C&C 3. The Scrin focus more on unit synergy and managing Tiberium than the other two factions. For example, the basic Scrin unit is one of the only ones in the game with a strict melee focus, but the unit may be attached to armored units in order to protect them.All of the factions in C&C 3 are relitively similier, meaning its easy to move between them at will once you understand the basics. The gameplay is definitely not as complex as StarCraft 2, and the simpliest strategies usually work. Any stratigy beginner should find alot to work with here, although I personally perfer the nutty Red Alert series to this one. Regular C&C is just a little too series in tone.An additional faction can be aquired for free through the Forgotten mod (adds Forgotten faction from older C&C).Gameplay:

												To everyone that is saying its not working on Windows 10, IT DOES....I did nothing to make it work, it worked the day I got it. Simply make sure you updated your OS from windows, also make sure all your drivers are up to date. Also to use mods simply go to the game and right click it then open the properties then click on the ""set launch options"" then type this in as is  -ui  it will allow you to open the game browser like most C&C games and launch mods.

												The typical EA malaise shines right on through at times, but due to the absolutely miserable job they did on the two C&Cs that came after it, I do believe this is the ""last"", best C&C.tiberium storyline, classic factions and plenty revamps of classic units plus cool new stuff.  Including of course the 3rd faction, which 80% of the multiplayer PvP community seems deathly afraid of. :PKanes wrath expansion is not bad also, but it's a little slower than this one due to ""balance"" changes to econ (+build times), units, etc.EA sucks.

												When I bought this game, I expected fast pace intense gameplay, and that's what I got. The campaign is long and challenging, which is good, excluding the Scrin campaign which was only 4 missions. While playing through the campaign you are presented with HD cinematics (before, after and during missions) which are fairly cheesy and unconvincing, however, it's better then nothing. The graphics, although not perfect, are very nice. Bottom line, if you have ever liked any C&C game, or you like RTS games in general, then I highly suggest you buy this because your missing out on a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is not alot you can say about C&C that isnt blatantly obvious. It is however one of the better RTS series I know. That said, this game does not come with the same feeling the first two games had. Part of me will always long for the classic C&C. There is a new addition to the factions however. The Scrin are an interesting faction to play with. It is just a shame that they were not expanded upon in the fourth game.			",235,14,5,31,16,0,44

												A few years ago when i played the game for the first time it was amazing and now the latest version is a complete wastte of a perfectly amazing game. Do not buy the game as EA has again ruined a perfectly amazing game with their updates. The gameplay has been ruined and there is no base building involved its just building units and the person with the highest amount of units win. We cannot build a fortress like before and the A.I is not at all strategic nature . The very nature of a strategy game has been removed and sad to say this game has been ruined for me and it was a complete waste of money.			",5,0,0,1,0,0,1

												I started quite a fan, great cinematics and acting for a game and it all seemed straight forward enough. Somewhere along the lines the, even normal difficulty proved to much. I set it to easy. Wow. Apparently there has been some rebalancing for the online component that has negatively affected the single campaign.The difficulty on the last few GDI missions is absurd. The computer AI is flawless, where as my guys all need massive amounts of micromanaging otherwise they act like some polygons on a screen without a brain.Too difficult, and unfair. 4/10			",716,264,22,74,58,6,80

												First off, let me say it pains me to write a negative review about this game. I love this game. Would I recommend it? Absolutely! There's just one little pproblem... IT WON'T LET ME PLAY. Idk why, I got it to work for like 27 minutes once, but I can't now. Idk why but I cannot even get into the start menu. Windows 10 has some kind of issue with it and the support site is less than useless. Thanks EA for once again testing my faith in the video game world. Long story short, I loved this game on console, I wish so badly it would work, but alas, no such luck. Who knows? Maybe you'll be more fortunate than I was, maybe it will work, I hope so. However I sorely regret paying for a game I cannot play. Best of luck to you potential buyers.			",8,0,0,8,6,0,16

												Difficulty for campaign is completely unreasonable.  An example: In one of the GDI missions in Sarajevo, you need to build up a force to attack a heavily fortified Nod position.  It's pretty much impenetrable to ground assaults and air attacks.  You can't use the ion cannon on the main objective because it's shielded.  Now, you would think the logical way to handle this would involve a build up of high-tech, high cost units.  But you can't- because you will be blowing all your money on building and repairing base defenses.  Let your base get destroyed, and you won't be able to complete later objectives.  There are no production facilities you can take out easily to slow down enemy waves.  The only defenses of the Nod base that you can destroy with impunity are the obelisks, which are vulnerable to air assault, but will quickly be rebuilt.I eventually assaulted the base with ten mammoth tanks, and managed to destroy less than half of it.  I couldn't do more because my base was destroyed at that point.On all missions, AI will also attack on two or more different fronts, and with such rapid, frequent attacks that even a diehard RTS fan can be overwhelmed.  Also, you can't build walls or gates anymore, because why would anyone want to keep enemy units out of their base easily?  And you can't build in certain locations for no discernible reason, other than the design team said so.This game is designed to be more frustrating than fun.  It is a far cry from Tiberian Sun.  It's a shame that such a game franchise went in this direction- I'm sure it's a great story, it's got famous actors in it, there are great units...but the fact that missions are designed to screw you over every way possible just makes this not worth the time.

Really disappointing; I have seen others post about this ""exception in exception handler fatal error"" in the forums as well, so I know I am not the only one dealing with this common issue. I am not sure if it is becasue of my Laptop being unable to process this game or if there is some sort of bug in steam that prevents running this game.

												This game is both good and bad.  The good part, is that Joe Kucan nailed the acting.  What other RTS can get away with full motion video and have it look good in this day and age?  The downside is that once the single player campaign is done, the content drops off remarkably.  Also, the patches for the multiplayer balancing f**** up royally the single player missions.  There is one GDI mission that has approximately the same difficulty as the final mission because they forgot to retune the SP eleements.   Anyways, it is a AAA game that is well polished.  If you don't have issues with EA or the lack of multiplayer, give it a go.  Otherwise, give it a miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to love this game, I really do, I've always loved Command and Conquer, but this game just isn't it. Units are expensive, to easy to kill, and not worth the money you buy them with.The AI is merciless and unfair to the point you honestly wonder if they even have to spend their resources, or if they just have infinite resources from which to build things. A well defended base in campaign got rolled over with in 5 minutes of me not paying attention, on Easy difficulty. EASY DIFFICULTLY.All and all this is a failure of a game, I'm requesting a refund for the Kane's Wrath expansion and hoping since I haven't played it I'll get money back. Not even for less then 10 bucks are either of these worth buying.TL:DR; There are many great RTS out there, this isn't one. Save your money, but something else.			",49,6,0,12,8,0,14

												I have been a strategy game player all my life, I and can honesly say this is one of the worst. Sure there are great graphics and the cutscenes that glorify you, the commander, with well known science fiction actresses playing the rolls are certain to make you feel like a conquering hero. But beyond that the gameplay is nearly unplayable unless you are an expert. I was playing on normal up until act 5 when I just got way to tired of having to restart. Because once you make a mistake, there is no recovering. The tiberium crystal economy is always too slow to keep up your war machine with the constant enemy advances. And the worst part of it is that you are basically on a timer. Because once you are out of the initial crystal piles, there is no way to keep up production because the crystal piles grow out of the ground at a slugs pace. On top of that, there seems to be no way to build up defences to use a 'turtle up' strategy, even while you are trying to build up your initial forces. And because of that, enemies are constantly getting inside of your base and wreaking havok on your very weak structures that cost more than an arm and a leg. On top of that, there seems no other way to win than to build up a massive force and then sweep the map. Because there is no real use for scouting and no long range siege abilities except on the absolute most expensive units, when it would be a much better idea just to build up a lot of mammoth tanks. You can forget about skirmishing as the enemy will always either have a large number of base defenses that will wipe out any small force or their troops will be in constant production coming out of their buildings so you wind up doing no real damage and lose everything. I do not recommend this game to anybody, even if you are already bord of all your other games. Stick with the good old Age of Empires or Starcraft series for a much more enjoyable experience.

												I rate this game 3/5. The game’s OK I guess though I’m really not that good at it.Pros: This game has many different difficulty levels and AI tactical settings allowing for a great deal of replayability, There are two campaigns and a skirmish/simulated multiplayer mode in addition to actual multiplayer possibilities, the graphics are the best I have seen on any RTS tactical game other asides from the Homeworld games and yet the system requirements are relatively low. The game also runs fast. There are 3 playable factions to choose from, the music is adequate at worst and catchy at best, the sound is outstanding, the controls have an easy learning curve and work well. This is definitely a worthy successor to the previous primary command and conquer game (Tiberium Sun) and picks up the story where that game left off. Units and structures are interesting and yet easy to identify (particularly if you are familiar with this kind of game), the game appears to be completely free of any bugs, the game's menus and interfaces are fine and yet for all this...Cons: This game is extremely difficult for a variety of reasons (and therein lies its main failing (or is it mine?). The AI on any setting rated medium or over can be extremely unforgiving of any tactical mistakes (as it appears to make no mistakes itself), the realism and realistic importance of the ""tactics"" involved in playing this game are questionable at best (and totally nonsensical at worst) as the game almost continually appears to encourage you to take 100 percent losses and attack without having all of your people and vehicles in order (or even constructed). Coordination between different types of vehicles and soldiers is a necessity but such vital elements such as airstrikes and artillery are given an odd, back-seat to the main, ground-based action (which is actually classic, normal gameplay for the Command and Conquer franchise). Air power is stronger in this iteration of the game than in previous Command and Conquer games but is still quite weak, requiring 4 or more aircraft of any type to have much of an affect in any battle (as was still true in past CC games) For all of the game's futuristic appearances, units behave in an oddly World War II styled manner (with similar (or lesser) ranges applying to their weaponry (as was also shown in past CC games), the game still often manages to feel like an elaborate board game throughout (like its predecessors), the environments are interesting and often beautiful but fall under only 3 main categories (alien, war-ravaged desert, and cityscape with some greenery), The main campaigns become extremely frustrating very quickly as they begin to continually (to the extent that the game becomes extremely predictable) place you in situations wherein the enemy has a totally unfair advantage and your own forces are in a state of severe disarray (as in previous CC games). The skirmish maps are perhaps the most fun part of the game but there is unfortunately not a great variety of them and they are often setup in an overly formal manner (it ends up looking sort of like you are having a battle in a war-ravaged formal french garden further adding to the feeling that you are playing a complicated board game). Perhaps the worst part of all this is however, how much raw potential for fun and interest which the game has but doesn't manage to live up to. The tactics in this tactical game rarely make much real-world sense....Or maybe I'm simply not very good at it or the tactical situations may simply be too nonsensical even for my tastes (but I never can seem to gather enough resources fast enough no matter how many refineries I build and regardless of where on the battlefield I build them).A friend of mine who tends to play more strategy/tactical games than I do also once told me he was having a hard time with this game too though...so maybe it's just a really, really hard game.Kane’s Wrath is better in every respect. It’s too bad you have to install this to play Kane’s Wrath.			",172,24,2,6,7,0,17

												Oh Tiberium Wars, why do you mock me so!I picked up a large number of C&C games on a Steam sale. I'd thought Tiberium Twilight would be the dog, but no, it was Tiberium Wars that let me down.I'd run it before on my laptop. I'd run it on Windows 7, and I'd run it on Windows 10. I'd even run it on Ubuntu using WINE. But the Steam version crashed every time I'd play the first mission, right near the end when they're about to give you access to the ion cannon. So, in spite of my love for the graphics, the sound, Billy Dee Williams' bad acting, Joe Kucan's overacting and Michael Ironside's underacting, I can't recommend it. Not when it doesn't run properly.Also, it doesn't support high resolutions out of the box, you have to edit a couple of files to get it to support widescreen.			",34,12,2,5,2,0,19

												Don't get me wrong, I've been a big fan of Westwood Studio's, but Westwood Studios has sold us out to EA, and this title is nothing but trash, with memory issues, to say the least...  It would have been a great ideal, if it would have been executed by the original developers of Command & Conquer, but EA lacks the ability to continue this dream, which is why they opted to buy, NOT the game, but basically, buy the fan base of the game, thinking it would put more money in their pockets...Where they went wrong, is their inability to achieve the same success that had made Westwood Studios a great success... They created the franchise, they new how it worked, the mechanic's, the in's and out's, and when Westwood sold us out, they knew the game was finished, and that they would not release another title, but wanted one last payout.  I miss Westwood Studios...I rate this game 4.5/10The best Westwood C&C in my opinion was Tiberian Sun, and the expansion pack, what was it?  Firestorm?  I don't remember...  But this game is not from Westwood, and if you waste your money on it, you'll only be paying for what it once was, by who once made it what it was...  Thats why the game doesn't work, because EA didn't fully understand the mechanics of how the game works to be able to continue in the footsteps of Westwood Studios. ",33,0,1,2,4,0,1

												I've been playing CnC since the original 1995 release and I was heartbroken by the death of the original Westwood Studios. EA managed one good release CnC: Generals and its expansion, which will never supass my love of the orignal Red Alert but may be the finest multiplayer experience I've ever had, in the ranks of Starcraft and Total Annihilation.That said, CnC3 and RA3 had been almost intolerable. The graphics, the gameplay, everything seems to be downgrade of what they've already done and the very well produced FMV's aren't enough to overcome that you're playing the same game that was much better the last time they made it.

												If you're new to RTS games, or games in general this is extremely simple, pointless little game you can play. It's not at all challenging, all the units are pretty standard with a handful of gimmicks here and there, and the story is pretty awful. Probably not worth whatever price they're asking for it, I regret buying it myself.			",88,34,1,14,15,0,24

Tiberium wars though is not as good as the previous ones let alone only be nod which is my least favorite team.			",63,24,0,25,9,0,20

												When I purchased this game I was expecting something that would remind me of the old Tiberium Sun game. But somehow the NOD forces became more freedom fighters than militants inbetween games. No Tiberium Wildlife, none of the mysterious creatures. The skirmish options are very limited, very limited. You can't build walls, no ghost stalker, unit no cyborg commando. Taking out elements that made Tiberium Sun great was the biggest mistake of this game. I wasn't able to find any of the nostaliga value that I was looking for.			",50,10,2,1,2,0,2

												Wow ! First of all, I'd like to say ""THANK YOU"" to Westwood Studios for creating such a great & diplomatic approach to 'blowing things up'.  I've played C&C since it was a demo disk at a small town's discount store - which is a long, long time.  I remember The Purity, The Excitement, The Strategy : Command & Conquer, Command & Conquer RED ALERT...and maybe one / two more.  I haven't played this one, until 2015 - I had purchased the XBox 360 verision when it was 'ported' or released for console.  The disc wouldn't work !! Brand New Pro, Brand New Game - couldn't install on HD neither.  (WTH ?).I had to wait another 8 years before gathering the patience to give it another try, if you're into Great Games, you'll understand the 'Time Gap' needed between 'Disappointments'.  I'll be honest - and ask a question - since I play on the Normal Difficultly, as any Non-Tense person might ; i'm NOT into 'Frantic Mode' and playing the Missions until I bleed SKIRMISH.  I've seen it, it gets that obcessive for some.  (I have always enjoyed the strategy)  ""Are the enemy units more difficult to destroy on the harder levels of difficults, or are their weapons more powerful ??""  I find the continual, and predicatble, and then absurd hordes of 'Pound User's Base','Flood with Increasing #'s', and 'Have more units with LONGER  RANGE with Very High Attack Points Attack Base' - just plain foolish and lazy for any game developer to puke up and call it 'programming.Where are the TOO SWEET (TOOLS !!!) !!!! Spy Satellite - NOPENon-Diminishing 'Fog of War' for discovered areas - NOPEUnits that can coordinate a DEFENSE POSITION - without babysitting those METERS away who won't attack - NOPEI think the whole - Fizzle, Dazzle, and Dim-Lit Sparkle took place of War Strategy, Great Maps than didn't need 'sub-objectives completed' before 'expansion, and Ability to Utilize Individual Units for Strategic Purposes.  I got, ""can't get that (limited unit maps Primarily) Money / Rank crate, because....uh....there's NO GRID FOR THAT FRICKIN' POSITION"" WOW !!  It's pathetic how you're units will :TANKS -1) Move forward, when you order a retreat.2) NEED TO HAVE WHEELS FACING ENEMY - The Turret alone - TO FIRE - ISN'T FRICKIN' POSSIBLE !! WTF !!!!!SNIPERS -1) Will not crawl or remain 'covert' when you order a move, wasn't there an ability to move 'discreetly' at one point ?2) Something about a Laser with Giant 3 Barrel Turtles - was I supposed to use this....or was it just something that got mixed up with Programming & Studio Production of Video Cuts ??Abandoned Building -1) Why is it - 80-85% of these are      A) Non-Repariable - WHY ARE THEY THERE !!!! WTH ??  There's just there to crumble randomly 5 minutes later ?     B) Any flame unit can knock out your Elite Snipers ('General' or STAR Rank), since their SUPER DENSE AND LIGHTWEIGHT Armor absorbs ANYTHING short of on Ion Cannon BlastNOD FLAME UNIT(s) - (ALL)1) Ground Troops - SUPER ARMOR, SUPER ATTACK POINTS.  2) If tanks would RUN OVER these guys, without command on former games, why is it - they're (tanks) just sitting around, to see if it's enough to destroy them ???APCs & Rocket Buggies -Maybe being lightweight would encourage you to attempt a Dash & Gash - notI'll work this guy over, NOD Tank Sqaud - with my LAME ROF (Rate of Fire)  Why can't you just be a Bad M-F'er and allow a COMMANDO to jump in the back....guess it wouldn't make sense to have 'Some Fun' with an Elite Unit.  Why the hell is Landed Casserole in this game...did he need a new cane, or just starving for work ???This game is so dumb, lamb, weak, and disasterous - I would recommended you give it to someone you truly dislike with a smile, they'll be confused - but then befuddled to the point - you can go on with your life WITHOUT having to worry about them - because they'll be trapped trying to just get past the 'Act I' Campain Missions.Why are there MULTIPLE sub slots for 'upgrades' you'll never see. Why not just 1 slot - are BOXES fun !! (??)I'm guess making unnecessary building is how someone collected a paycheck.Ion Cannon UplinkEMP Space Uplink.""Well you can't put them together - since they would run off the Same Grid""(Ion) - this one is in space....(EMP Space Uplink...this on means an aircraft unit, or NAVAL Unit that you can only see offshore & NEVER UTILIZE is kicking them out.  Dunno. Maybe a Pelican with Bionic Wings, and a Payload Capacity for Bullsh*t is doing all the work.It's just looking like something, someone wanted to drop off (C&C) - literally - since all the 'BUZZ' that created was good enough to slap EA on it, and just do 'whatever' since the Title will carry the weight, not the New Company with Lazy Programmers who were probably too busy playing Gay-Lo to give a sh*t about doing this thing right !Pathetic.

												Wow this game is terrible. First of all, it interupts the flow of gamplay every 5 seconds by pausing the action and moving the camera around the map to tell you what your objectives are. I don't see why they can't just tell you of your objectives without interupting the gameplay. This is really annoying. Secondly, the voice acting and dialouge is really cheesey and phoned-in. Generally RTS games don't excel in this area, and it's usually not a big deal. So the fact that I'm complaining about it really shows you how bad it is. The first two things alone wouldn't be a dealbreaker by themselves. The real dealbreaker is that the campaign is ridiculously hard. The AI has infinite money the whole time while you run out of money in the first few minutes. There is no way to keep up with the computer's economy and production. I had to sell most of my structures and mine all the tiberium fields just to defend myself from constant attacks by epic armies of doom. I've played tons of RTS games and this is the worst balance and hardest campaign I have ever seen in an RTS. Starcraft 2 on brutal difficulty is easier than this on normal. Save your money. because this game sure isn't worth the price, even when it's really cheap for the summer sale. EDIT: I gave it another shot, and wow does this game handle bad. You units don't auto-attack buildings, meaning you have to constantly babysit them which isn't fun.			",67,21,0,24,2,0,15

												While I did enjoy the game, if you can't get through the campaign it's not worth you're time. I like the game but the campaign levels were too hard even on easy. This has always been the problem with C&C games. You play skirmishes, adapt your tactics and play style, play campaign, get struck on a level and put the game down. I like to know how the story ends and I've played my share of skirmishes but if the campaign A.I. has to cheat to make the game difficult no thank you. The campaign A.I. certainly does cheat, massively! They have lower construction time and production time, superior units (even units considered as fodder can still beat half your military force) and vast abundance of resources. So as I stated before if you can defeat the campaign A.I., have a hign stubborn level to keep trying over 30 attempts for a single campagin level, or don't want to play campaign, buy this game. It's a fun game really but campaign lets it down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Steam Portal Players,I'm writting a quick review of the game: Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars.The game was great and mind boggling before when it was first created by Westwood Studios in the 90's before EA acquired it through parasitistic relationship from Westwood Studios. EA took the brand, games, then had made it terrible such as this one. The gameplay is not much changed, but the theme, graphic, and stories are all downgraded.EA has most of the negative aspect as a ""challenge everything"" motto with its attitude towards games like : The SimS, SimCity, and Mass Effect, the worst they have done is with Command & Conquer series, Tiberium Wars and Red Alert series.I can't be more dissatisfied with this one developer that ruined the whole nostalgia of good games. I'm not sure about other players, but my experience with this developer is disastrous. Thank you and have a good day.Best Regards,Fachmann			",14,0,0,2,1,0,3

Note: I have this game on Origin with 335 hours prior to purchasing on Steam. Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is a worthy addition to the C&C franchise. It runs well and is generally bug-free — though a few irritating bugs are present, such as: sometimes, while in a skirmish game against an AI, stealth is useless. Their units follow your stealthed units around as if the unit was visible.The game butchered the 'tiberian' canon somewhat from the previous games. Originally, 'Tiberium' used to be some sort of organism; a plant that crystalizes minerals from the ground and emits poisonous gases. This entity was sent to the earth by the Scrin to transform Earth into a planet suitable for them. In this game, they completely changed the chemical composition of the entity. Instead of an alive plant-like organism, 'tiberium' is now a crystal that acts like some sort of lifeless radiative substance sent to Earth to crystalize the entire planet for mineral harvestation.Aside from the canon, the storyline is... okay. It's not great, but if stories aren't your thing, it's passable. If you're joining the series without prior C&C experience, the story is not really that interesting.As an RTS title, I would say it is disappointing. Work has gone into balancing and unit design, and generally works, but as a balance system alone, it is pathetic. In order to win, you need less strategy and more tank-rushing. Infantry are almost useless and aircraft aren't far behind.A good point of consideration is the availability of mods, however. There are some mods that add desperately-needed balancing changes to make the game require an actual brain. There are also mods that boost the total hours you are going to get out of this title by converting the game to fit with unique themes, such as: Dune II, Cold War era, modern warfare, etc.ConclusionI would recommend this game only if you have been introduced to the C&C series prior to the release of this title. If were looking at it purely as an RTS, it does okay. You might want to pass it up if your standards are somewhat high. Otherwise, I suggest giving it a try. I love the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After (infamous) Generals era, which didn't really feel like a C&C game and feel like slowed down, less-awesome version of Starcraft that so what resembled C&C its gameplay, experience, in its quirkiness. EA tried yet again to make another C&C game. With Tiberium Wars, they brought back something that was missing from the previous games (or any game since). The overall gameplay feels like a C&C game, the experience feels like a C&C game, and the quirkiness feels like a C&C game. Do recommend!			",114,0,0,11,12,1,24

												I grew up playing the C & C line of games and I loved this one just as much as I did the others. The ever growing conflict of NOD and GDI always gets me and I love the cinematics that get drawn into the game between each scene. It really gives off this whole 'Commander' vibe that they want you to feel since the videos are all First Person and they address you directly instead of in the Third Person.Gameplay wise: The game is a standard RTS with your usual Technology upgrades/research facilities to upgrade and optimize units. If you keep a sharp mind and have a pention for tactics this game will be relatively easy but will continue to draw you in with it's replayability.Online Gameplay: I did find this rather lacking as the players that seem to use the game use certain builds on a regular basis and it seldom leads to interesting encounters. But, to each his own.			",31,4,0,9,3,0,13

Note: I have this game on Origin with 335 hours prior to purchasing on Steam. Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is a worthy addition to the C&C franchise. It runs well and is generally bug-free — though a few irritating bugs are present, such as: sometimes, while in a skirmish game against an AI, stealth is useless. Their units follow your stealthed units around as if the unit was visible.The game butchered the 'tiberian' canon somewhat from the previous games. Originally, 'Tiberium' used to be some sort of organism; a plant that crystalizes minerals from the ground and emits poisonous gases. This entity was sent to the earth by the Scrin to transform Earth into a planet suitable for them. In this game, they completely changed the chemical composition of the entity. Instead of an alive plant-like organism, 'tiberium' is now a crystal that acts like some sort of lifeless radiative substance sent to Earth to crystalize the entire planet for mineral harvestation.Aside from the canon, the storyline is... okay.

												Another installment of the Command & Conquer Tiberium series, another job well done by the developers, in my opinion. Being a fan of RTS games that feature diverse factions and in this case even races. Although that game resembles the classical Command & Conquer games of having a central building to 'deploy' other buildings to build up a FOB, the graphics (both for the environment of the maps and the animations/physics) are set to be very realistic, which as not always been the style of other installments in this series. The game can be rather unforgiving, forcing the player to act quickly and not slack off, yet this dynamic component alongside the 'diverse factions'-factor is something that true RTS fans, who also enjoy games such as Star Craft: Brood War, will welcome.

												I originally purchased this game when it first came out years ago. My rig at the time was slightly crippled by the awesome battles, but now, armed with a somewhat high spec machine and a Dell U2711, I was worried the 1440p resolution wouldn't work. So glad I was wrong! This game looks just as good, if not better, than it did when it first came out and I have found myself falling in love with it all over again. Haven't tried multiplayer as I always sucked at it. But the campaign is great and the skirmish is fun. The battles are entertaining and the intensity, colour and light will make you want to wear sunglasses its so awesome! Now just need to get Kane's Wrath and continue to bathe in the nostalgia. GET THIS GAME!			",66,15,2,5,16,2,12

												Decent game. My only complaints are:EA completeley changed the atmosphere of the game. It went from post-apocalyptic, dramatic and gloomy with some heavy science-fiction elements, to Modern Warfare as an RTS game with aliens. They completely got rid of a lot of aspects that made Tiberian Sun such an atmospheric game, such as map-wide ion storms, tiberium mutants (while they still exist canonically they only rarely make appearances), and NOD was dumbed down greatly in the sense that their technology now sucks pretty badly and their numbers/strength are fairly laughable. You can't have a singleplayer skirmish without the AI spamming grenadiers/black hand/buzzers. Those are the only infantry units that the game's AI will make and it makes it extremely frustrating to employ infantry of your own because those three types of troops clear garrisons and kill infantry instantly.The scrin are OP - it's mostly a matter of how you fight them but considering they get fighters that don't need to re-arm and gunships and frigates and all that and the NOD and GDI only have fighters and some light AA, it's not really fun to go up against them unless you know exactly what you're doing.-Another thing about the Scrin is that all or most of their units get shields. It's like playing against the protoss in Starcraft all over again.Another thing is that defenses suck (unless you play with the old Tiberium Essence mod) - there's no walls and turrets are pretty weak. All in all I'd give it a 7/10 because I loved the previous C&C games and EA did a good job of continuing the story for the Tiberium series, but it is lacking in some areas that could have been executed better.

												Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is an amazing game set in the alternate timeline in the command and conquer world where Tiberium has been discovered and is eradicating the entire planet as a major military force GDI tries to keep the world at peace and stop the spread of the Tiberium while the Brotherhood of Nod recruits people living in ruined Yellow Zones (areas that while habitable despite Tiberium exposure are very poor and full of strife) to combat GDI and speed up the spread of Tiberium considering it the next chain in humanitys evolution.The graphics in the game are great even when on low but if you've got the graphics card for max settings its a feast for the eyes (for the games time anyways). The tanks look massive and the unique units Nod has like the Avatar are imposing but not impossible to down and watching your super weapon utterly annihilate the enemy base is always visually satisfying be it a nuclear bomb or the Ion Cannon.Sounds as always are good. A tank firing a missle sounds like, well, a tank firing a missle. The music soundtrack is good as well but most times youll be to focused on dealing with an enemy onlsaught to really listen to it.The story is rich and the FMV sequences are great and all feature famous actors such as Micheal Ironside. Theres 3 campaigns as well each telling the story from a different side. The first being the GDI's campaign and the second Brotherhood of Nod campaign but the third campaign (which i wont spoil here) is only unlocked after completing the first two campaigns.Difficulty can range anywhere from cakewalk to seemingly impossible. This is mostly in part to the games latest patch which balances some units more but breaks others. Example would be the Mammoth Tank and Black Hand. The mission the Tank is introduced for you to use is supposed to be an easy one due to it being GDI's best land vehicle but after the patch the tank is not nearly as powerful as it should be which in turn makes the mission a lot tougher. The Black Hand is a flamethrower unit for Nod and being infantry are supposed to be weaker to anti infantry turrets but after the patch not even 3 anti infantry turrents can down one squad of them. Post patch the only effective way to deal with them is either aircraft bombings or attempting to run them over with a tank which they seem to be able to chew up effectively too.Overall Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars is worth the buy along with its expansion pack Kanes Wrath. Its definitely one of the greatest Command and Conquer games out there alongside Command and Conquer Generals. I give C&C TW3 an 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best game of the Newer Franchise!Im a long time fan of C&C, and have been playing ever since they came out with Covert Operations back in the 90's. I love RTS's, and this one hits the mark for me. Out of the last 4 games that have came out recently, my opinion is that this is the best one. I have spent countless hours on this game just developing strategies for each race, learning weaknesses and strengths, and the advantages they have over military, economy, and defensive measures. I love the single player campaign as well, such an enticing story! Gets you sucked in, and you will be at the finish line before you know it! Everythinng about this game is golden! I really wish they could remake this game, maybe a new update or patch, but i read that they shut the company down who was overseeing this game. Cannot create clans, no patches or updates, and no exp. packs besides Kanes Wrath. So that is the only downside i see to this game, other than that, mappacks and mods really add to the complexity of this game!Over all scoring of all the C&C games for Command & Conquer 3,92/100. Hope this review helps you choose this game. I would purchase this game for whatever price, for you will get your  moneys worth and so much more!			",75,1,0,2,6,0,9

												Wasn't a big fan of C&C during the Command Prompt-days, I was more of a Dark Reign, Total Annihilation-junkie.  I certainly missed out on the fun when I picked up this game.  Similar RTS strategy typical to the genre - collect, build, destroy.  I like the realistic graphics, the fact that you can occupy buildings with your troops, and the graphics (did I mention that already?).  The skills sets wasn't as robust of that of Supreme Commander, but the unit graphics were appealing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I only rebought the game recently on steam, and I'm able to replay the campaign without it feeling like a chore. (that's good)It's better than the fourth one, which you shouldn't get.Classical units are in the game, like: orcas, flame tanks, mammoth tanks etc.The Campaign isn't so short and is challenging depending on what difficulty you play on.If you like the series, this one is okay, and the expansion is a must.

												I can only think of one reason why you shouldn't buy this game. That reason is that this game will make you feel depressed, depressed that EA destroyed the beloved C&C franchise and there will probably never be a true and faithful sequel - mind you C&C 4 may exist but ""true and faithful"" it quite clearly is not.

												A solid RTS that is every bit the spirit of the original Command and Conquer (unlike Tiberian Sun aka C&C2). While the graphics and animation keep you visually engaged in the action, the unit pathing and build inferface fail to advance beyond the 1995 iteration. The single player missions and story keep your interest with varied playstyles and scenarios. Much more than the original demo led me to believe it would be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Real review ladies and gentlemen hold onto your buttsCommand & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars is among one of the most fun and addicting games I've ever played.The story is a little bit wonky, apparently the Philadelphia being destroyed is a lot less of a big deal than it was last time, but this time I guess there wasn't a big fat tiberium missile looking to wreck everything, and an inexplicable gap between this one and Tiberian Sun which they did fill in later. Other than that however, it's fantastic (omg michael ironside <333).The gameplay is quite amazing, very fun, though unit pathfinding is quite bad. Frequently, moving groups of units, mostly ground vehicles, will have them going all over the place, into different directions, and sometimes they'll just sit still and not move despite your orders to have them move. This can become frustrating very quickly, especially in skirmish and multiplayer games where this can delay an attack.But overall, C&C3 is a brilliant game. Though it doesn't capture the dark and gloomy atmosphere of Tiberian Sun, somehow missing out the world looking like it was recently all on fire and the legendary ion storms, it is graphically stunning. From the maps in general down to individual units themselves, C&C3 looks just beautiful. It was a joy to play through.Buy this game. If someone doesn't like it then they probably only don't like EA and decide that means it's awful. Or maybe they legitimately have a reason. I don't know. I don't really care. Just buy it. 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply a great RTS game. I was incredibly surprised at the amount of single player content there was, I haven't even played the multiplayer at all, that's how good the single player was to me.There's 3 races, athough you use 2 for most of the single player. The graphics are very good, the game is very well optimized, and the difficulties feel fair most of the time (you can change them between missions in any case).Only big problem it got is controlling big groups of units due to the way the game handles groups and movement speed.But even with that problem in the way, I still recommend the game for its story and gameplay. A great game all together in the RTS genre.			",110,4,1,14,2,0,10

Preface: I would consider myself well versed in this universe, and a RTS fan in general- (Empire Earth, AoE, SupCom, Warcraft) Also, the games i've played in the series are as follows: C&C1, Red Alert 1, 2 and 3, Tiberian Sun, and Generals.Somehow, over the years, I missed this one, and I am grateful it ended up on the Monster Summer Steam sale 2015. This is a wonderful classic RTS, that holds up well after 8 years, and plays beautifully on our up to date hardware at max settings. (I was unable, however, to get it up and running in 4k, oh well, 1440 is plenty suffice.)The amazing gameplay I have grown to know and love over 25 odd years is firmly entrenched in this version. Exceptional production values, great acting from Michael Ironsides (Starship Troopers) and Billy Dee Williams (Star Wars), and just overall brilliant polish throughout Tutorial, campaign and Skirmish. A steal at $4, but well worth any asking price in my humble opinion.			",22,5,0,3,7,0,8

												The base game is meh. All of the cool units from Tiberian Sun have been written out of the plot for on reason or another. However it has aliens now. Remember the ""Scrin Ship"" from GDI's Campaign in Tiberian Sun? They did expand upon that and created a 3rd faction. There is a mod called Tiberium Essence that brings back the units from Tiberian Sun and makes the game a much more enjoyable experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun RTS even playing it in 2015. I played C&C series growing up and loved them, so coming back after a couple decades to pick up where I left off was quite fun.  The cut scenes were as cheesy as always, with an over-the-top storyline and great heroes/villains.  Personally, the Nod Campaign just felt more epic than the GDI, but both were dwarfed by a surprise that was incredible to discover.  #noSpoilersPossibly one of the best releases from Westwood Studios...can recommend to any RTS fan. :D			",204,77,5,52,36,2,57

												(Note; I've played this game for over 250hrs outside of Steam)It's no Tiberian Sun, but it's by no means bad. It's certainly not as horrendous as C&C4 by any stretch, but it could also have been better.I do however have some gripes with this game that I need to mention.- The game varies from the typical image I felt fit GDI and Nod quite well, making Nod more of a religious fanatical force, and GDI more a modern-day military, which sadly seems to be an attempt at mirroring the whole 'middle eastern conflict' that even today stretches on. - The technology seems to have dumbed down; after the Second Tiberium War, a load of units (Titans, Subterannean units, etc) were decommissioned. Most of them are rectified in the expansion, but they were iconic to their factions and logical tech paths for them to have taken; removing them seems rather silly.- The atmosphere is lacking in comparison to its predecessor, Tiberian Sun; the tiberium wastelands sorely lack the same sort of apocalyptic feel that was present in TibSun.- The storyline of CABAL from TibSun: Firestorm seems as though it was completely ditched, which is a little sad.Overall, though, the gameplay is very much solid and even to this day works well. I would recommend it, especially with the Kane's Wrath expansion, and I give it an 8.5/10.			",173,18,1,28,11,1,30

												EA made the Command and Conquer more mainstream, making  the story mode (outside the Scrin of course) to be lackluster. However,  Command and Conquer 3 is great over-the-top action RTS game that should be played at least once. However, if you grew up on Westwood or other classic games like Starcaft like myself, then Command and Conquer 3 is average and forgetable. While Kane's Wrath adds some interesting modes and depth, I can only recommend this game to those who didn't play Westwood games or any classic RTS game for that matter. The multiplayer can be fun, but it gets tiresome afterwhile. Overall, if you want to get this game (for whatever reason), buy it when it is on sale. The cutscenes are not as rewarding as classic Westwood games and EA completely trashed the Command and Conquer mythos.  Not to mention, the game can insulting easy at times. *Sigh* I miss Westwood.

												After (infamous) Generals era, which didn't really feel like a C&C game and feel like slowed down, less-awesome version of Starcraft that so what resembled C&C its gameplay, experience, in its quirkiness. EA tried yet again to make another C&C game. With Tiberium Wars, they brought back something that was missing from the previous games (or any game since). The overall gameplay feels like a C&C game, the experience feels like a C&C game, and the quirkiness feels like a C&C game. Do recommend!			",114,0,0,11,12,1,24

												I didn't grow up with the C&C series, nor was my first game one of the original Westwood games, but I sure wish I had. Playing this game on the Xbox 360 was hell, but I enjoyed every minute of it. I did play Tiberian Sun recently and I will say there are a few thing I like more about this game. Firstly, more than one build que. While there's nothing wrong with the originals build que, it didn't exactly let me build an army quick, or help me build units to defend my base. Second, the mods the community has made. ods like Tiberium Essence really balance out the gameplay and offer TRUELY different styles of gameplay. The original's balancing wasn't bad persay, but it did more often than not rsult with GDI/Scrin steamrolling everything. The community really tries to stay lore friendly aswell, with The Forgotten aiming to tell the story of the Forgotten mutant faction.Again I really wish I grew up with the Command nad Conquer franchise, but I suppose it's heartwarming to see a newer generation appreciating these games. Now if you'll excuse me, a Mammoth Mk2 is attacking my base...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is one other francise that does better in my opinion but this is definatly number two in my book. Number one being the Warcraft series by Blizzard . With that said , Get this game you will not be disapointed and the story mode is acually really really good . I definatly recommend this game for the RTS fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolute best RTS to come out in a very long time, mixes well the 2 features Command and Control, instead of how many RTS nowadays simply urge you to mash one army into the other with no preplanning, or massive logistical hurdles. Each match is like a single battle of the war, instead of how many games try to force you to control a match as if it was the entire war in itself. Leading you away from the core elements of a RTS, which is the combat between  two opposing forces.			",118,14,0,23,39,0,48

												Here we go.....Command and Conquer Tiberium Wars 3. I've played C&C since Tiberian Dawn, where it all began and since then I have played and loved them all. Tiberium Wars is an incredible carry on from Tiberian Sun. Westwood may R.I.P but EA did an amazing job in creating this masterpiece to carry it on (only wish they'd left it at that). ""Peace through Power"" quote from none other than Brotherhood leader known only as Kane, of course he's back people. Buy it now to see what he has in plan for GDI this time.....or maybe he's waiting on....'The Visitors'			",11,2,0,7,6,0,11

												Fairly decent game considering what C&C2 was. Actually pretty good game despite C&C2 sucking nads. Colorful, fastpaced like Red Alert 2 was, but not as cartoonish as RA2.			",243,26,20,21,20,2,50

												Now, if you're reading this, you love command and conquer. In my opinion, this is the bes of them, and as far as im concerned, the series died here, and died well. This game is a highly addictive RTS game that used the hints at alien existence in the previous games to create huge twist and add a lot more depth to the game. If you play as the GDI, you should focus on vehicle divisions, Nod focuses on infantry and stealth tactics as seen with their damned stealth tanks...and the Scrin...well...for your sake, I hope you have AA defenses...or you are doomed before you start...

												I originally purchased this game when it first came out years ago. My rig at the time was slightly crippled by the awesome battles, but now, armed with a somewhat high spec machine and a Dell U2711, I was worried the 1440p resolution wouldn't work. So glad I was wrong! This game looks just as good, if not better, than it did when it first came out and I have found myself falling in love with it all over again. Haven't tried multiplayer as I always sucked at it. But the campaign is great and the skirmish is fun. The battles are entertaining and the intensity, colour and light will make you want to wear sunglasses its so awesome! Now just need to get Kane's Wrath and continue to bathe in the nostalgia.

												Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is an amazing game set in the alternate timeline in the command and conquer world where Tiberium has been discovered and is eradicating the entire planet as a major military force GDI tries to keep the world at peace and stop the spread of the Tiberium while the Brotherhood of Nod recruits people living in ruined Yellow Zones (areas that while habitable despite Tiberium exposure are very poor and full of strife) to combat GDI and speed up the spread of Tiberium considering it the next chain in humanitys evolution.The graphics in the game are great even when on low but if you've got the graphics card for max settings its a feast for the eyes (for the games time anyways). The tanks look massive and the unique units Nod has like the Avatar are imposing but not impossible to down and watching your super weapon utterly annihilate the enemy base is always visually satisfying be it a nuclear bomb or the Ion Cannon.Sounds as always are good. A tank firing a missle sounds like, well, a tank firing a missle. The music soundtrack is good as well but most times youll be to focused on dealing with an enemy onlsaught to really listen to it.The story is rich and the FMV sequences are great and all feature famous actors such as Micheal Ironside. Theres 3 campaigns as well each telling the story from a different side. The first being the GDI's campaign and the second Brotherhood of Nod campaign but the third campaign (which i wont spoil here) is only unlocked after completing the first two campaigns.Difficulty can range anywhere from cakewalk to seemingly impossible. This is mostly in part to the games latest patch which balances some units more but breaks others. Example would be the Mammoth Tank and Black Hand. The mission the Tank is introduced for you to use is supposed to be an easy one due to it being GDI's best land vehicle but after the patch the tank is not nearly as powerful as it should be which in turn makes the mission a lot tougher. The Black Hand is a flamethrower unit for Nod and being infantry are supposed to be weaker to anti infantry turrets but after the patch not even 3 anti infantry turrents can down one squad of them. Post patch the only effective way to deal with them is either aircraft bombings or attempting to run them over with a tank which they seem to be able to chew up effectively too.Overall Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars is worth the buy along with its expansion pack Kanes Wrath. Its definitely one of the greatest Command and Conquer games out there alongside Command and Conquer Generals. I give C&C TW3 an 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No introduction or in depth review needed. This game brings back so many memories for me, and not only this one but the whole C&C series. I remember building a huge army and totally whiping the enemy out so many times. Each time it was just as fun and with balanced difficulty. Red Alert was probably the first milestone, but Tiberiam Wars is refined and the best in the series if you ask me. It still brings a punch and unlike others I had no problem installing this and playing it right from the start on Windows 8. Join me, and we shall conquer the world!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best RTS games of recent years, A killer single player campaign that adds to the established story. Multiplayer allows for lots of customisation of enemy AI and each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses. The expansion, Kane's Wrath, only adds to both the plot and gameplay. Overall great game, deserves to be a classic, and definitely deserved a better sequel.			",180,12,1,15,3,0,25
