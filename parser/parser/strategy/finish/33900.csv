Posted: April 14, 2015
												'Do you recommend this game,' Steam asks me. I do, emphatically. I hope this anecdote from an in-game multiplayer experience I had will explain why. Prepare yourself for ARMA2: The Review: The Movie.Spring, 2011; early in my ARMA career, first tour of duty after a Steam Sale. I'm a fairly fresh recruit, seasoned with a couple dozen game-hours spent trudging through an expansive and swampy learning curve. Spent today at work, drove home, made dinner, cleaned up; it's Game-O'clock. Steam. ARMA2. Launch. Menu surfing, looking for multiplayer. Server browser hits my face with lists of information. -AWP-Warfare Capture the Island mode looks appealing tonight. Played it a couple times before, and I feel comfortable with the basics by now. Server connection established.Click! I'm in, filling the boots of a digital NATO badass. Apparently, international treaty organisations occasionally require the service of men with guns. Disturbing thought, but I'm no politician. I'm just a nobody with a rifle, taking orders that filter down the food chain. Those orders fill my mind now. Objective: town. Location: nearby...as the crow flies. Heh, the team's commander does have airborne technology unlocked, I just don't have the cash to buy a lift yet. Looks like I'm taking the scenic route. A quick check of my map tells me I'm at one of our hidden frontier bases and that there's two whole mountains between me and the nearby town. Great... I'll be taking the scenic route to the scenic route. The map tells me more: several of my team members and their A.I. controlled task forces are currently approaching the town. I'm already late for the party :(Might as well bring the fireworks.The base I'm at has only an armour factory and infantry barracks, but both will well suit my rapidly forming battle plan. I'm thinking heavy calibre fire support from high ground, overlooking the town. The topographic information in the map shows that the road I'll be taking is nestled around a minor hill as it approaches the town. Perfect. I'll park two BMPs there and they'll provide overwatch of the whole area while my comrades finish their capture of the town. An LAV will ferry me and one squad of A.I. infantry to the combat zone. I spend the required funds and set the plan in action.Wait a tick, BeatYourHeadIn, are you telling me you actually have to plan how you’re going to get your troops and equipment from point A to point B in ARMA2? Logistics in a game!? Yes, actual logistics...in a game with a map so FRIGGIN’ big you need to employ logistical planning skills to see any sort of success. And it's not boring!Back to the story. Formation of a military convoy. A few orders issued to my A.I. controlled task force later and the BMPs are on point while I lounge in the command chair of the LAV at the rear of the column. I man the turret-mounted automatic grenade launcher, a devastating weapon. Its barrel is ominously pointed at and tracking a lollygagging friendly player as my convoy departs base. Yeah, that's right chump, make one wrong move and I'll end you! Though itching to test the power of my new toy, I decide it's not worth getting banned over.  I let my teammate live, for now.The A.I. drivers of my convoy are as dim as a new moon, but I can fine tune my plans and keep up with current events while they drive. It's an 10 to 15 minute (realtime) drive that negotiates a winding mountain pass through an elegant evergreen forest. These are backroads, unpaved; enemy forces unlikely to be using this route. I feel secure enough that I spend most of the trip looking at the map, reading topography, lanes of fire, positions of friendlies. I smile when I realize I could probably minimize ARMA2 and play a few rounds of Counterstrike while my convoy travels.Dying immediately is certainly the last thing I'm worried about as I crest the peak of the second mountain.Suddenly: EXPLOSION..DEAFENING SOUND..FROM BEHIND..MASSIVE DETONATION..JESUS H. CHRIST WHERE IS THAT VOLUME KNOB! What is going on here!?My turret pans to the rear of the LAV. The sight, what a sight...I'll never forget. Fire. Wall. 60? 70 feet tall? A wall. Of fire. Taller than the trees in the forest, literally FILLS my view from left to right. There is nothing in view except the fire. I'm in awe. Confused. Shaken. I've seen 'splosions in this game before, BUT NEVER LIKE THAT! Did somebody tried to nuke me FFS!? I know there's no nukes in this game mode, so...Over the cacophany of destruction: the scream of jet engines. Very close. As the flames die down, a large shape traverses the air over the crest of the crag. Airframe, Sukhoi configuration. Enemy. Wing tilted down slightly; canopy visible. I know he's surveying the carnage below him. Hunting me. Cursing his aim when he sees the LAV still intact. I feel small, molecule small; what I just witnessed was caused by his war machine. Napalm bombs. Heavy ordinance. Whatever it was, it dealt complete destruction to that forest.Understand this, readers: in this game, air superiority is a literal phrase. Air is SUPERIOR in this game. This isn't your Battlefield ""oh look I can shoot a few rockets from my jet fighter and maybe kill one or two goofs on the ground and then reload (because reloading rockets on a flying jet makes a lot of sense) and kill a couple more goofs"" experience. No! In ARMA your aircraft can have a payload of more than a hundred devastating rockets and you can fire 'em full auto like a machine gun and destroy an entire town worth of goofs on the ground if you wanted to. Ha! Forget about balance! This is the real life Shiznit. Modern air forces don't invest heavily in war planes because they're ""balanced"". They invest in them because they can kill a hell of a lot of people quickly! ARMA2 knows this. Simply put, the developers have a big Bohemian boner for air power.But BeatYourHeadIn, what happened next? Tell us! Okay, I'll tell you. A miracle happened. My convoy survives the 'splosion to end all 'splosions. My battle plans go up in smoke like the forest around me. My current objective is to live through the next 30 seconds. The LAV is the only reason I'm still alive. It is damaged, but drivable. I order my drivers to haul♥♥♥♥♥in a forwardly direction. I track the Sukhoi as the convoy labours onward. The receding bogey performs a wide highspeed U-turn. He's heading straight for me again. Relentless much? He's the UPS guy we all wished was real: the one who comes back after he missed you the first time, instead of leaving a note telling you to pick up your package at the office near the airport!Then, from beyond the first mountain I had passed: a smoke trail racing skywards. Anti-aircraft missile! Ha! RETURN TO SENDER, A-HOLE! Two vectors intersect in a puff of smoke and light. Direct hit! Booyah! Wait, uh... he's still flying at me. HEY! HE'S STILL FLYING AT ME!With black smoke billowing out of his engines, this topgun is still determined to deliver my severance package. Frantically, I order the BMPs to target the limping jet. Cannon rounds arc through the sky in attempt to smite the airborne menace. Sukhoi Dude is getting closer, but he's losing altitude. Fast. He's now descending below my level on the mountain, looking up at me through the trees as he approaches. None of the BMP fire connects, but it doesn't matter. THIS GOOSE IS COOKED BOYS! Relief. Now, his desperation salvo of rocket fire is way off-target; falls harmlessly some distance away. I watch him frantically yaw right and nose up as his fighter loses the last of its life-sustaining lift and plummets in a sideways cartwheel into the trees. The inferno he leaves behind is a feast for the eyes. There was nothing left but a dark crater.Now, I can start thinking about that town again...What, are you apes gonna dig him a grave!? We got our own mission to die for! Forward march!All that's left to say is: play this game!			",116,23,0,18,15,0,34

												I grab my rifle. One last day. I run to the sarge. One last fight. I board the huey and we take off to the island of chernarus.We land, and slowly crawl out and lay in the drenched bushes from the last nights rain. Our objective is to take out the target, a war lord that is helping out the OP-FOR take over the island. We move up to a shaded, half destroyed barnhouse that was obviously bombed a few days ago. We run upstairs, and sit at the side of the window so we don't get spotted out by a sniper. The quiet is too much, no distant battle noises at all, no vehicular action whatsoever. Just the sound of the metal from our rifles resting against the shattered glass window frame. ""Delta-one, come in. We have spotted an enemy convoy heading to your position, possibility of the commander in one of the trucks, how copy? Over."" ""Good copy, over."" ""MEN, GO PUT YOURSELF AGAINST THOSE WINDOWS AND DEFEND THE HOUSE!"" The sarge yells. I sprint over to the right side window and rest my M4 against the smashed out window. A silhouette of a tank comes over the horizon of the road. ""Sarge, I see an armor coming over the horizon, over"" I say. ""Take cover and wait for my orders!"" The sergeant barks at us. The rest of us wait for a few minutes as the sarge keeps peeking over my window, wondering how we are going to evade/take this convoy out with one M136 Rocket Launcher.The sergeant peeks over again. ""The convoy has stopped infront of the house, get ready boys, I think we have been spotted!"" ""АК Солдат! Перейти четкое наверху!"" A russian voice from downstairs yells. We all point our weapons at the stairs, and we see a shadow emitting on the wall appearing to be walking up the stairs. ""Get ready"" Sarge whispers. The russian soldiers head pops over the stairs, we all start shooting our rifles at him. ""ВРАГ пятнистый! --- Черт!"" The soldier yells, one bullet hits his head and a mist of red blood flys from his head as he drops to the ground. ""Dossy, go check the window!"" The sarge demands, I look out the window and see a russian soldier wielding an rpg in his hand pointing up at the window. The rpg turns into a fireball coming closer and closer, and the whole top floor is leveled by the explosion.My eyes open, to see the sarge, and the rest of the squad dead around me. My legs are broken but that doesn't stop me. I equip my rifle, load a magazine, aim through the sights and put my sights on a russian soldiers. I shoot him in the chest and he drops, still alive, he pulls out his makarov and shoots my shoulder. My hands shaky, I fire a few more bullets in his direction before manages to get a shot on my head.(Based on Multiplayer ACE Milsim I played.)			",72,9,0,8,12,0,6

												This Review will be the same for Operation ArrowheadPros - Actual Military Simulation- Realistic Design for both Takistan and Chernarus- Decent Singleplayer Campaigns- Great Ingame Sound Effects- Realistic Scenarios and Military Stategies- Multiplayer is very Mod-Friendly and full of options- Fleshed Out Ingame Menus to adjust pretty much everythingCons - DayZ destroyed the community (More Below)So my only real con with Arma II and Operation Arrowhead is that the community that remained on Arma II, mostly a few small Warfare and Domination Communities, is now dead and has moved on to Arma III, that is understandable. Arrowhead is a different story. The game is still very alive, the issue with Arrowhead is the community is ruined. DayZ brought around some of the worst types of people. Before DayZ Griefers were very rare, now they are everywhere and the worst part is, they hack and destory servers and get accounts banned. The game in its current online state is poor, and that is sad, very sad, especially since I remember when it wasn't like this. Arma III is shaping up to be a much better game than what we currently have in Arma II, and the community seems to be holding together, more than likely because DayZ is now a standalone game. My gripes are more personal and subject to opinion though. Both Arrowhead and Arma II are amazing Military Simulators. The Singleplayer is realistic, and top notch. Nothing but the Original Operation Flashpoint can really stand up to it.9/10 - Both great titles, but I would recommend not buying them anymore and just purchasing Arma III until maybe the DayZ fad finally dies out.

												Arma 2 was one of the first games I got on steam. Though I haven't been around P.C. a lot this is by far the best game I've ever played. Along with Arma 2 and what I think makes this one of the best open world games there is is the modding community. Hundreds of mods have been made for this game and each one making the experiance even greater. Another great thing about this game is the size of the maps. They are HUGE! The amount of vehicles and units is another big plus for this game. For the best experiance I would get the Arma II: Complete Collectionfor the best experiance but the game should be okay by its self. I would give this game a 10/10. The only con is that you need a good computer to run this game, especially DayZ. I hope you liked my review and have a nice day :).			",56,0,0,4,12,0,14

												ARMA II is the best military simulator (of the FPS genre) on the market. It follows a similar formula to that of EA's Battlefield series, but has a stronger emphasis on realism which lends itself to slower and more intricate gameplay. ARMA II requires a strong processor and a good deal of patience to play. Be sure to pick up Operation Arrowhead as well (if you aren't able to get the complete ARMA II collection), as it'll grant you the ability to play the renowned DayZ mod.			",123,14,1,17,16,2,59

												Arma ll is the only game i know that not only let's you spawn 250+ people on the map (tanks,planes,helicopters and soldiers) but also let's you create a playable chicken, cow or any other animal with the option of making it the rank of colonel.The In-Game Editor has hours of endless fun by letting you create the scenario you want (each time you play the said scenario it is played differently every time so it will never be the same), be it massive scale wars across the whole map or just enjoying a nice boat ride along the coast.There is even a few campaigns to add to your enjoyment.Fed up of the Game Already?- Don't worry there is a whole bunch of sites that have modders working for your entertainment adding in more cars, boats, planes, and soldiers as well as AI improvements, Particle enhancements such as WarFX Blastcore. There is even a couple of realism mods that enhance the whole game also there is a World War 2 Mod so if you are a fan of Saving Private Ryan you can re-create that epic beach assualt at normady or just watch the U.S, U.K, Germany and others fight it out in the sky, on land or at sea. There is never any dead multiplayer servers either so you are not wasting your money with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NOTE: As of May 31, 2014, all multiplayer capabilities have been removed from this game. This is the only reason I do not recommend this game. Otherwise, it is probably the best game I ever played in my life.I absolutely LOVED this game when it was in its prime. I've spent most of my hours playing Chernarus Life when it was still a thing that existed, usually on the Excyted Gaming servers (even if the admins were absolutely rеtаrdеd sometimes - fυсk you Eric). Regardless, I've played through the campaign, spent hours and hours at a time working with other players to liberate towns, outposts and encampments in Hohei Evolution Blue and Evolution Red on the Anzu's War Games servers. Eventually, after playing this game for a while, I purchased Operation: Arrowhead. The original ARMA 2 still had an enormous playerbase even though OA had been released for quite some time as well. I found myself enjoying ARMA 2 over OA any day. The fact that OA lacked Chernarus Life and replaced it with the less-good Takistan Life Revolution and Island Life was offputting for me, since those maps were less well suited for a civlian-vs-cops type scenario, whereas Chernarus was literally the perfect ""Life"" map.ARMA 2 was a bit clunky in the controls, but once you got them down (or simply adjusted the keybindings in the options menu) the game was such a blast to play. I probably spent about 50 hours in the mission editor alone, creating my own little missions and scenarios to play through with friends or on my own. I won't get in to the specific features of the game itself, because now that the multiplayer is gone nobody will ever be able to experience the game in its full potential again. The game is entirely dead now due to the GameSpy shutdown, which hosted ARMA 2 servers, but you can still play multiplayer in Operation Arrowhead. That being said, this game was absolutely fantastic. 10/10 from me, even though it had some bugs and a few odd things here and there, that's what made it ARMA 2. ARMA 3 doesn't come close to this game. Not only does ARMA 2 have more guns and vehicles than ARMA 3, but the mission editor is much better as well. So, for my conclusion?Don't buy this game. It would have made a great purchase any time before 2014, because the multiplayer still worked and there was a huge fanbase with a wide variety of servers and community-created addons that made the game so much better. ARMA 2 is now just a mediocre single-player campaign. For $12.99 USD (price as of August 12, 2016) this game is absolutely not worth it. I'd say it's worth about $5, but I really think that Bohemia Interactive should make it a free game since all it's used for nowadays is being able to play the DayZ mod.			",36,5,0,3,3,0,0

												Arma... The good old days....Arma is a first-person/third-person Strategic action game from bohemia interactive, its not fast-paced like Call of Duty, and its not as graphically inclined as far-cry 4 but its a shining gem coated with diamonds.Voice Acting- is♥♥♥♥♥♥Audio (Vehical, gun and ambient sounds)- GREAT.Single-Player- Fun but needs more content (Operation Arrowhead adds great new campaigns)Multiplayer - No longer works but if you get hamachi then it worksGameplay- It takes patience and strategy, no more runnin around trying to get kills, its about teamwork and staying aliveMap/Scale- Really big, 250 km big mapREAL WAR- Arma does great at what it says it does.This is a simulation game howevery some funny♥♥♥♥♥♥can be done and WILL happen, you have been warned9.8/10			",252,27,10,23,22,0,18

												Why I bought the game: DayZ / Friends begging meWhat I liked about the game: *I would like to say the game says 9 minutes played I have played hundreds of hours on the mod, and about 20 on the ArrowHead expansion, which I did play with a friend and will be the basis of this review NOT THE MOD.* I bought it to play the DayZ mod at the time (yeah yeah dayz fanboy),  I've always been a fan of Delta Force, and Battlefield series. I mostly enjoyed this game as a Combat Flight/Tank Sim to be honest, not to say the ground combat is bad - I just really enjoy the feel of flying a Helicopter/Riding an APC into combat with 2 or 3 friends inside. It's a hardcore fps experience that will leave you extremely frustrated and laughing your head off, Hours have literally flown by playing this game and messing with the editor. Definitely a step up from CoD, or other typical FPS games, if youre looking for something more elaborate, and you have the hardware to take advantage of this games huge maps, doin't hesitate to try it, although overwhelming at first, rewarding in the end. Great modding and mature community.What I didn't like about the game: Playing with friends requires ports to be adjusted, this game is not easy to play with friends, and you should do your research before getting excited about multiplayer. This game is also hard to optimize, again do your research!Would I buy at current asking price of 12.99? Yes**Disclaimer**I would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant. The current date of review 11/5/14.

												This game was and still is a brilliant game. It carries enough realism into warfighting games. The missions are challenging (in a good way). It can be hard to begin playing if you haven't ever played Arma, so I recommend going through the tutorial mission to ensure that you are accustomed with the keys.I definitely recommend Arma 2 (and all of its expansion packs, especially Op Arrowhead)			",129,25,3,22,18,0,5

												EDIT: I have changed key portions of this review due to fanboys freaking out over a difference of opinion. Let me clarify something; If you honestly enjoy this game despite its flaws and quirks, that is COMPLETELY fine. I'm glad you enjoy it, and I wish I did, but I simply do not. That's all it is. You're not an idiot for liking it, and I'm not an idiot for disliking it. Please, read the review, and consider it as someone else's point of view. It should not change your point of view if you enjoy this game. Thank you, and enjoy my review of Arma 2 :)I've have given this game many chances. I play it for a bit, than uninstall it, and then I reinstall it, thinking I may have missed something, seeing as a huge portion of people love this game. However, the more I try to play this game, the more I am mindblown this game is so popular. Let me elaborate a little.First off, I'm not knocking the games aesthetic appeal. It's a very good looking game for the most part. There are a few textures that look like they were made for a 90s PC mystery game, but overall, I am pretty impressed with the games looks, and how fast it runs. That's not my complaint though. That little feature right there, is the ONLY thing this game has going for it. Once you get past the looks of the game, get ready for a mind bogglingly BAD control scheme, unusable menus, and possibly the worst voice acting and music you've ever heard in a game. Let's start with the music and voice acting. Good lord are these bad. The score sounds like it's from an old 80's Segal movie. It's trying SO hard to be badass, and it falls so short. I'm not saying it's BAD music in itself, but with scenarios they play it in, like WALKING ACROSS A DECK, they've decided that blaring rock solos so loud, to the point where you can't even hear character dialogue, is appropriate. Really? Why is that an issue? The music should never drown out dialogue in a game, especially when it's ambient background music. This should only happen if the music is LITERALLY happening from something in the environment, like a concert or something. Now along with audio, lets look at voice acting. Now, not ALL of it is bad, but the majority is pretty much something out of vampire diaries. I know most marines and soldiers are normal guys who all want to have a good time as much as anyone else, and use phrases like ""bro"" and ""dude"" like anyone else, but when those phrases are used in this game... Oh my god. It legitimately sounds like that ONE kid from school that tried way too hard to fit in. They emphasize ""BRO"" way too much. ""Tell me about that new sweet house of yours, BRO."" And if you read that with a 90's surfer accent, you'd be spot on. Let's move onto menus. This SHOULD have been something simple. However, I made an online game over LAN (so no one would join) and was simply trying to get the hang of the controls. First off, just trying to make the game, was a task in itself. WHY IS THERE NO SIMPLE MODE SELECT?! Instead, we get this rediculous list of unspecified random words. 1. FIRST OF WAR. WHAT IS THAT??? Is that a mode? Is that the campaign? What is that? A little description would be nice, but no, there's nothing else. Just a huge list of things like that. So I selected a random one, and I get the campaign. That's fine in itself, but I'll get back to this later. Let's move on for now.So let's talk about controls. I have never, in my life played a game, that has the most backwards, rediculous, most roundabout way ever, to make controls for a shooter. Now, I'm no huge CoD fan at all. I've played a few, but I've never lost my crap over them or anything. They're mainly just ""meh"" games. But I'll tell you one thing; NEVER have I EVER complained about controls in a CoD game, or a BF game, or a Halo game, or just about ANY other shooter ever. Why change this scheme? I've looked at the controls, there's no reason to have them that way. Why can't MMB be the button for zooming with the scope? Guess what you use instead? THE ""+"" key! So NOW you're juggling between your mouse and your keys, and switching hands and WHY NOT JUST USE THE SAME CONTROLS THAT HAVE ALWAYS WORKED? So why not use the MMB to zoom the scope? Oh, I see why! Because it's being used to scroll the ""ACTION WHEEL"" so I can open a ♥♥♥♥ING door. No, you can't just click to open a door. You scroll to select the action, and THEN click to open. Mind you, this is how ANY action in the game works. If there's multiple things going on, like say, you're near a door, and a gun, and a person to talk to, you have to scroll through all this♥♥♥♥♥♥ and pick the one you want AMIDST all the action going on. So have fun juggling with your scroll wheel on your mouse, while trying not to get shot. Why isn't ""F"" the action key you ask? Because THAT'S being used to switch weapons! WHY NOT THE NUMBER KEYS?? BECAUSE THOSE ARE BEING USED FOR RANDOM SQUAD DIALOGUE! ... ""C"" is crouch, which is fine, but for SOME reason this isn't a toggled crouch. You have to hit ""X"" to stand, and ""z"" to prone. WHY? Why get rid of these instincts that have been ingrained in our brain since the first Halo game? Why change something that works perfectly well? Why not HOLD ""C"" for a couple of seconds to prone, and just hit it again to stand? So as the tutorial is teaching me this, and I think I'm getting the hang of it, and I continue to hear more robot people try to voice act, I finish the tutorial. Well you know how I'd selected the mission from the ""create a game"" menu before? Well instead of acting like a normal ♥♥♥♥ing game, and continuing to the next mission, it just repeats. WHAT? Why would I want to do that? Why not go to the next one? That's literally the most irritating and pointless system possible. This isn't Gallaga. I don't want to try and replay to get a higher score. I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME. So I try to quit the game, but hitting quit JUST RESTARTS THE ♥♥♥♥ING LEVEL. I had to ALT+TAB to minimize and then task manager that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. Then I figured since I'm doing all this crap, might as well uninstall it! I can't recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a game that plays well. If you can see past the broken controls, bad dialouge, a mediocre score, and unworkable menus, and truly enjoy what Arma is trying to be, then go right ahead, and game on. But for me, some one who is probably overly critical, I can't enjoy, or recommend this game.			",149,11,0,16,10,0,7

												Simple to review:This is the most realistic military simulator for the PC available to the public.To get this many features with any more realism you would have to have a security clearance.If you have a slower machine, or you just prefer the looks of this, Arma II is the best choiceif you can not play Arma III.Yes it has a learning curve, but nothing someone who enjoys this type of sim couldn't handle.Yes it has a lot of key commands, but no one who plays this is using a gamepad.A little dedication and patience will be rewarded with one of the most feature richmilitary simulators on the market. The only military sim on Steam I can give higher praise tois it's successor, Arma III. ",491,115,35,78,78,7,113

												This game is amazing. The community is like no other. There are very mature players, and some great modders. Maybe you have heard of Dayz? This mod is for ARMA II and is a hyper-realistic zombie survival. You run around and loot, kill, or simply help others. You can build bases, drive, fly, or simply sneak around by foot. The medical system is super cool as well, and they have fixed most bugs with dayz. Now this is just a small bit of ARMA II. There is the mission editor which is really fun to mess around with. The multiple campaigns are fun to play and are dynamic at times. One of the only flaws to the game is it's graphics but they are not horrible, nor perfect. The AI can be a bit slow at times but you can beef up their skill so that will make them extreemly OP (Over Powered).Worth a buy? - Yes!Rating - 9.2/10			",115,19,6,17,50,3,22

Arma 2 is above all:- Realistic- Highly moddable- Playable as DAY Z (original game)- Comes with tons of weapons- Comes with tons of vehicles- Has great gameplay mechanics- Has a great sense of realism (bullet mechanics and drop)Overall if you are looking for what is I think the best tactical shooter in the world then you wont go wrong with Arma 2. It still has an active modding community as well so new stuff is available all of the time.			",364,121,9,39,78,5,61

Posted: February 19, 2014
												I'm going to try and keep this simple and to the point. I am not much for words but I'll try to condense what I think about this game.Pros:1. Huge potential. Large seamless maps. You can drive, fly or run across km after km. Towns, roads etc.. Basically entire detailed islands.2. Great military sim taking advantage of the above. Realistic damage from small arms as well as vehicle weapons.3. Lots of realistic military vehicles and aircraft. Even boats.4. Multiplayer is fun, especially coop.5. Speaking of multiplayer, Dayz mod is something special. Very fun and you can waste hours and hours in it.6. The single player story is alright, I guess. Nothing to tell mom about.Cons:1. Bugs, glitches, more bugs. Absolutely unbearable, game breaking, punch your monitor and throw your computer out the window kind of bugs. Because you can only save 2 times per mission and the mission mught be very well broken before your first save and you won't know it until the end, which can take 1 hour or more if you take your time like me. All sorts of bugs. AI pathfinding drives your teammates vehicles off of cliffs. Mission scripts break and you can't complete the mission. You may fall through the floor and injure yourself badly or die (especially annoying in Dayz). I could write pages detailing the bugs, you get the idea.2. Second most annoying thing is the interface and the interaction system. You have to scroll through a list of actions to change your weapon, get in a vehicle or perform some other mundane function which shouldn't be that complicated. There's a key for everything and then some. It's very clunky, slow and prone to you pressing the wrong button or doing something unintended. Controling your squad mates and telling them where to go, what to attack is tedious at best.3. Clunky player movement? Even cars drive like crap and those are the easiest to control.4. Inaccurate helicopter controls. Don't even get me started, whatever you read on the net, trust me. The heli controls are bad and make no sense. I have no idea what they were thinking when they decided that the helicopter would start acting like and airplane above 50 mph. I can fly no problem in flight sims and the Battlefield series. I even fly RC in real life. This is innacurate, plain and simple.5. Devs had plenty of time to address these bugs/issues and this is a problem. What a bunch of underachievers. Their strategy is like this: For every new iteration/expansion, focus on adding more crap and complexity built on the same shoddy engine/interface and ignore all the bugs. Then collect money and develop the next uncooked iteration.Arma2:OA isn't that much better, either. The missions bugs are fewer, but everything else is the same.The bottom line: This is the kind of game you play because you know what to expect and you still want to play it because there isn't anything like it. You have to be a cult follower, or else you will hate it. The main reason you might get this is to play Dayz mod, which is great, but expect to be killed falling through floors, off ladders, killed by zombies walking through walls, etc... Definitely not for the casual gamer.			",96,3,0,8,9,0,21

												Arma 2 is a tactical, slow-paced military shooter that rewards commanding your squad and well-thought out strategy as opposed to the run-and-gun styles of modern day FPS. The game screams authenticity throughout its campaigns and expansions, and contains some of the nicest environments for its time. It's now a fairly dated action military sim. The campaign story felt real, but the plot itself was rather bland. Team fights were predictable, and needlessly complicated with the jarring communication system. Oh, and the dialogue was awful. Your team sounded like robots and shot like they had aim-bots (which wasn't necessarily a bad thing). I will say that the tutorials were in-depth and entertaining. They break down a game that would scare any person if they looked at the key binding section first. I will also say that the multiplayer system is just as rewarding. I commend its development team for being so open with its community that has returned the favour with brilliant total conversion mods such as DayZ and numerous RP servers. If you want a game with in-depth mechanics in a military setting, this is for you. Get the expansion too - another game in itself. Having developers that make expansions that thorough is now an unfortunate rarity. Support them with all of the monies.			",291,42,3,23,15,3,8

												One of possibly the best game ever. There is such a variety of things to do, if you have the internet for it. Its so much more than an army simulation, theres playable armouries, minigames and my favourite, Cherno RPG life. The possibilities are huge and theres even Day Z like stuff if you cant afford OP Arrowhead. 11/10 would sex			",37,1,0,1,11,0,1

												Walking in the Woods with Your Bros (WitWwYB) Simulator 2012 was amazing.  It was a huge upgrade from Guns + Woods + Walking = Best Friends 2011.  And took all the good things from I'm Not Gay, I Just Like the Way It Feels 2010 and put it all into one fantastic game.Me and my bros talk about how charlie ruined our step father's lives; which led him to sexually abusing us.  But instead of saying it over vent in our mother's basement's.  We say it in a virtual world of anything but static environments such as woods.  Places with trees.  Lush forests.  Jungles made of temperate flora (so not at all jungly).  The best part is I am pretty sure only white people are allowed to play this.Bros being bros and giving each other deep♥♥♥♥♥kisses.  I give this game 5 stars out of 7 crayons*.* - The color of those crayons are as follows: Macaronni Orange, Maroon Yellow, Lime-Peaches Red, Tequila Sunrise; an alternative to Lime-Peaches Red, Marker red (this was a marker), and Jerry's Gay Blood.

												While it may seem like I've not put any considerable amount of time into this title that is not case, I put nearly 300 hours into ArmA 2 & OA via OA's launcher.ArmA 2 was a big leap from OFP and Armed Assault, it brought lots of new mechanics and assets that made it the civilian military simulator per default.If you're looking for military action that doesn't involve arcade-like gameplay, cheesy stories and overly ridiculous firefights but actual tactics, realism and immersive gameplay.Then this is a title you must try!

												Arma 2. It is both bad and good when compared to Arma 3. Arma 2 base already has many more weapons than Arma 3, but it is a lot less optimized than 3. I can run 3 but often have trouble running 2. That doesn't matter if you have a god computer (Unlike me) then I'd recommend Arma 2 over 3. Yes, Arma 3 has better graphics, but would you eat a golden♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm not saying that Arma 3 is♥♥♥♥♥♥ but 2 just has a lot more vehicles, weapons, and just has a better singleplayer story (In my opinion) I will not speak upon mods because they are not included in the base game.

												Personally? I don't. I don't really regret getting this game; it has terrific military simulation, and from what I can tell good multiplayer. BUT. It requires a beefy computer, has pretty complicated controls (all fine and good if you're into a really in-depth military shooter, but it's not what I was expecting), and frankly does cost a lot. This is for a niche audience, and I couldn't just recommend this to everyone. But hey, if you're super into military stuff, you might like this.			",81,21,2,10,23,0,11

												This is a great game, perfect for the people who enjoy realism. It boasts a strong campaign with multiple ways of completing each (I say 'each' as there is multiple campaigns).

For the multi-player, I guess so, many like it.But for the single player campaign, you need to have incredible patience, for the bugs will drive you nuts.It could have been revolutionarily great, but it is just good. Bugs, bugs, bugs. Oh, and it runs like crap even on top notch hardware of 2014.So it's a 6.5/10 from me. Very nice effort Bohemia, but it's about where I would expect an early-stage Beta to be.

												Although this game has quite a learning curve, I have found it to be extremely injoyable. Before playing this, I did not realize just how open world it truly is. The single player campign is fun, if a little glitchy, the coop is easy to start up, and the editor is easlily one of the best I have ever used. The graphics are impressive, even for a game thats a couple years old. The voice acting is odd in this game. Since there are so many different siturations you could be in, the audio bits are all cut up. It sounds very disjointed and almost funny, but you will get used to it quickly. One big drawback that needs to be talked about is the AI. It is simply disgusting. Your squad will almost never do as they are told, and can die very quickly. And scipted evens rarely tigger, so lots of reloading required. The draw distances inparticular are impressive. I have only played a few minutes of the mulitplayer, and it seems that it lacks direction, and could take a while for anything to happen. DayZ is fun, however is somewhat annoying. I would not buy ArmA just for Dayz. I have only had this game for about three days, and have already put 15 hours into it. If you have the patience to learn it, please buy this game, and love it like I have.Pros:+Realism (Sometimes too realistic)+Graphics+Coop+Mod support+Map editior (But jesus is it confusing)Neutral:*Voice acting (You get used to it)Negitive:-Scipting errors (Waiting for hours for the AI to realize what they need to do)-Learning curve-AIOverall: 7/10 This game will appeal to only a select group of people. If you are on edge, probably dont get it, as you will most likely not like it. This requirers a ton of time to even begin to learn how to play it, and even then the game is broken a lot of the time. Yet somehow I found lots of enjoyment out of it. Dayz is very buggy and at this point just get the standalone if you want it so badly.			",249,33,2,33,17,3,36

												Before purchasing consider how many people have purchased this game versus how many recommend it. My experience was far less than stellar, and can only say ""buyer beware"" on the grounds that this game is fundamentally broken at the technical level. Maybe after a decade or so of patches...Edit: This recommendation was written before steam implemented the reviews system, and recommendations were available only to friends. The total number of recommendations written was posted next to the game (since recommendations were assumed to be positive), and I noticed the number of recommendations for the game was abnormally low. The total percentage tells a more positive story, but in my opinion the game is still sufficiently unstable that I wouldn't recommend it.			",217,50,4,23,15,1,37

												Arma 2 + Arma 2 OA were 2 of my first games bought on Steam. I bought them in the bundle, and was instantly IN LOVE.Arma 2/OA keeps you busy for HOURS. I really enjoy playing the various mods such as TLR and DayZ. It's 6 years old, and there is still an ENORMOUS player-base. As for graphics, if you max them out, they still look pretty damn good, if you don't compare it to Arma 3, of course. The campaign is a bit bland, but I mean, it's a simulation game, not really story-based at all. The multiplayer is where it's at. Go try it.I recommend this game to those of you who enjoy simulation games (like myself), FPS's, and open-world games.0 Comments	 Subsc			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A massive undertaking for any studio, much less an indie, this game combines the hardcore military simulation that the Arma series is known for with a surprisingly epic campaign that manages to be realistic, dramatic, and compelling all at the same time. It has multiple branch points, multiple endings, and showcases a very plausible tour of duty for a spec ops unit during a conflict between a psuedo-Ukraine and Russian-backed rebels (which turned out to be quite prescient...)

												The most realistic modern military shooter you can play today. Accurate projectile ballistics, including material penetration, ranging from small-caliber handgun bullets to hellfire missiles. Wound severity based on location and type of damage, including broken bones from falling damage. Fatigue and accurate movement speeds. Fluid viewpoints and the ability to lean (who does that anymore, right?) Artillery, airstikes, long-range bullet-drop snipes, the loud and scary snaps of bullets whizzing by, the inability to confirm a kill unless you see your enemy die, and more. If you are about realism, this is the game for you. The only issue is that this game requires a hardcore gaming PC to run. It will tax your system if you do not have tip-top hardware.

												Did you fall in love with ARMA3 after purchasing it in beta dev. but then a few months later your pc took a dump and you couldn't play ARMA3 anymore? No? Mus jus be meh. Bought ARMA2 to compensate since my wittle podunk laptop couldn't handle A3, and I was not dissappointed. The point that I've come to figure out about Bohemia is that they mastered simulation gameplay early on. Yes, ARMA3 has its advantages, as any recent addition to a franchise would. Better environment designs, graphics, AI, weapons & vehicles, user editing & moding power, of course its all going to get better with each new addition; but ARMA2 easily keeps up with its predecessor.You've still got all the power given to you in A3 in terms of mission editing, and spite having smaller maps, they're still very much large enough to conduct full scale operations or drawn out sniper steak-outs. You still get physics and environment. Just buy the damn game! You won't regret it. I will still play ARMA2 after I get my new PC, in addition to ARMA3 (which you should also buy)			",103,1,1,12,2,0,6

												WARNING THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THE AVERAGE CoD or BF player. This game will only appeal for extremely hardcore war veteran gamers looking for a true realistic experience. Everything about this game will have tons and millions of real war mechanics from its count of over 100 real military vehicles, amazing arsenal of weapons, and extremely strategic gameplay this game will make your work work work. The problem with this game is that it is being compared with battlefield and call of duty franchises. This is not a game, it is a SIMULATOR. It's for patient people who are looking forward to use military terminology with friends and squad mates to avoid the incoming paratroopers landing from that Z11-W scout helicopter. Do you have any IDE what I said? Maybe you will if you played this game.			",38,4,0,2,1,0,2

												This is the Mil Sim game. If you want to feel as close to a real war or shoot out as possible this is the game you want to play. The game vanilla isn't to bad but arma 2 is best with ACE or some other mods or custom missions. Once you play Arma you understand what a mil sim or tacitcal game is and what it isn't. Run forward like an idiot and you die, hide and you die, look the wrong way and you die. Very little hand holding and its wonderful. Its a game that attempts to recreate a warzone while still retaining some fun. If you buy Arma 2, pick up Operation Arrowhead with it because alot of mods like Dayz (I hate that garbage) require it or are better with it.Hooking up with a nice milsim group and you will have alot of operating fun. The only disadvantage is that Arma 3 is out so 2 is on the way out. Even with only another freind or player or two Escape Chernarus is a wonderfull mission especially with ACE.Graphics, Gameplay, its all good and intuitive. AI can be very impressive with ACE, vanilla AI can be very cumbersome and slow though but once they do react it can be quite impressive. Though there are alot of glitches here and there one thing to remember is its a mil sim, not a driving simulator or what have you.			",329,48,6,36,35,3,74

												Isnt it awsome to snipe a Ka-52 with an M1A1? or take out an M1A2 Tusk with a Tunguska? or go 1v4 an be able to win with the moment of suprise? This game has it all, there are gamemodes and servers for all kinds of people and their play style. You can use tactical supports and teamwork, or go all out as a lonely wolf. The selection of vehicles and weaponry in this game is huge, go Troll your enemies or teammates with a Lada or go and demolish them with a T-90, Help out your team by flying an MV-22 and getting your team around the map or use an A-10 to provide Close Air support. When i was still a newbie to the game, people helped me and were friendly, altho the game looked a bit weird and difficult to me I got used to it and is now my Favourite game. I do recommend this game for people who like challanges and are patient. The game also has many downloadable content from Mods, Maps, Weapons and Vehicles to Single and Multiplayer missions, Graphics, UI and character change options. As i said, i do recommend this game, its got its weak points and glitches, but there also are those awsome moments when you snipe a jet with a T-72 or a SMAW, or get a lucky headshot on a guy gunning on a UH-1Y Venom.

For those who want to just mess around with the vehicles/weapons/units, there's the armory (Quick and easy to use) and the editor (Kinda hard to use, but can be used to create great missions).

												(This Applies to Arma 2 CO aka ArmA 2 + ArmA 2 Operation Arrowhead) What To Say about Arma 2 CO. ArmA 2 CO is not a game. It is a drug. A Very addicting drug. Wether itd be the difficult and hilariously bad campaigns, the dumb hotshot mcgee ai, the trolls, the variety of weapons/vehicles/mods/skins/dlc or the numerous gametypes(Wasteland, Life, Clan Activities) you will be pleased. As to why I call it a drug. You can be doing great or enjoying your self and then all of a sudden something will happen that will put you in a real down mood(Death, Deadly Bugs, Scripters to then be put right back up wether itd be revenge or a very funny bug. ArmA 2 CO is by far my drug of choice and yours aswell!  Enjoy yourself out there troops!			",149,6,8,7,18,1,16

The online community is not butchered by 12YO kids screaming at the mic like they do in DAYZ Mod. Thankfully there's an active community of players who still play tactical. ARMA II is still relevant & it is the way to go if you like realistic and slow paced military sims.			",239,61,13,50,41,2,37

												The best military simulator hands down.  Has a great moding community that is really helpful.  Arma 2 has a campaign but dont bother with it.  Terrible is being generous.  This game is all about user generated scenerios, and those that you make yourself.  Its pretty easy and there are lots of tutorials.  I made numerous games, some fun and goofy, others serious and hard with bits of story for my friends and I to play.  Even scenarios can be different each time as you have a chance to appear option.  Between the base game and the expansion (A true expanson) as well as player made items and viechles I see no reason to play arma3 and its fake made up guns and veicles.  For those of you who think dayz is garbage, I agree with you only because this game engine could not be a worse match.  The reason the zombies do not work is arma has no melee mechanic and building fighting was not a priority for the AI.  In 7 days to die the zombies will literally rip your face off.  Dont judge base aram2 and ace mod on that. Getting off topic.  The game is old enough now that even the notorius CPU hungry arma engine should be easier to manage.  Also turn off motion blur.  I forget if it is an option or if you have to delete a file.  I remember it being a pain.  You will get sick, why games insist on putting blur in that my human eye will already produce for me by looking at the screen is beyond me.  It just amplifies it to a point where we would have gone extinct if thats how our eyes work.Overall if you want to make scenarios with massive engagements, scripts, or small ones in a huge map, then yea this is really the only game out there.

												Arma 2 is by no means a game for noobs or traditional FPS shooters. It instead caters to players who want a realistic military shooter. And realistic it is. Before playing any game, the player must properly plan their course of action with their team members, or hell will break loose. This aspect of the game is extremely fun and engaging. It's when the mission actually begins, however, that the game becomes quite unsatisfactory. The gameplay is, unfortunately,  like a three legged horse trying to win a horse race while suffering with diabetes and terminal cancer. The sad reality is that the game's graphics are not up to par with the 2008 standard I'm used to, and the actual firefights are extremely unsatisfactory. The movement, strange screen bobbling, and clunky guns don't sound good, and their damage and recoil is questionable at most times.To make matters even worse, the interface is clunky and not easy to learn. Me and my friend were struggling to determine how to coordinate several missions. I'm all for a detailed interface, but make the options relevant in the game. Movement is even worse, and feels sadly completely broken. There are also a handful of glitches that I encountered such as falling through maps and colliding with enemy units and not being able to separate again. The AI suffers from strange glitches as well, and don't respond well to the terrain.The worst part of the game is the voice acting. Oh god... it sounds like they hired Joe at the bakery to do the voice acting, and it really shows. I have always been a stern believer in that voice acting should only be done if you have qualified voice actors who can do that job. If not, just having text is NOT a bad thing at all. Overall, Arma 2 is not the realistic military shooter that you should choose. The only realistic thing you will find here is a damaged keyboard from anger issues. If it is a realistic military shooter that you seek, then Arma 3 should be your choice as they fixed almost all the items I have mentioned above.Score: 3/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL; DR Version: This is as close as you get to a real modern warfare combat simulation, you get powerpoints, military jargon, and one of the worst optimized games of all time.The game opens up with a powerpoint briefing . . . reminds me of my time in Afghanistan.  Although I have heard much praise for the game I could never even get the base game to work correctly in co-op LAN.  Also the game runs slow as crap even on strong machines with dual GTX 560s.  I find the game overall to be a little too realistic if you are an actual Soldier (or have been in) in real life.  Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, and SWAT are all games that are pseudo-realistic and have both working multiplayer and fast-paced action that can be jumped into relatively quickly.  I would recommend those before Arma II.			",258,31,4,56,30,1,77

												The game is somewhat realistic, I guess, but that doesn't necessarily make it fun to play for normal people. I have mouse acceleration off and couldn't aim properly. I think the camera has unadjustable deadzone or something. The geometry is a nightmare, the NPCs were incredibly slow, and the game lacked purpose.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh Arma 2. Where do I begin? First off, let it be known that this game is NOT a 1st/3rd person shooter game, it's tagged a ""Military Simulator"" or ""MilSim"", for short, for obvious reasons. This game is designed to deliver a realistic warfare feel to it, complete with accurate ballistics, realistic gear loadouts, and over 40 weapons and vehicles. I paid for this game and all the expansions, forking out a pretty 40$, mainly for the DayZ mod, as Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead are required, the other expansions supposed to ""improve graphics/animations"", so after it sitting in my library for a couple years I felt inclined to try it. With that out of the way, time for the nitty gritty of this review.The game spans over many miles (yes, literally MILES) of open country to explore throughout missions, including many cities, villages, farms, industrial complexes, hidden camps and castles, and the general rolling fields and foothills. Although, alot of this is just more ""eyecandy/backdrop"" than actual relevant terrain, as some of the missions only have you operating within specific areas. No worries, as when the missions open up for you, you are allowed to decide exactly how, when, and where you go about meeting and accomplishing your objectives. So, putting you in the boots of an experienced First Recon Marine Combat Vet, and allowing you to control his squad, drive Humvee's, or call in Helo-Extract at your leisure sounds tempting, correct? This is where the game is wrong. Firstly, if you've docked many hours in Call Of Duty, or Battlefield even, and for some reason think this game is gonna be along those same lines, then you're wrong. It's nothing like them. In more bad ways than good, I'm afraid. A vast majority of the voice acting is horrendous, im saying Marine's that havent hit puberty horrendous. Or how important character's voice over sounds like it was done over a phonecall, perhaps google translate even, and any character that is not in your squad has terrible or non-existant animations, standing like statues only moving their mouths to the occasional garble the spit up. Top it off with even worse AI and you got yourself a nice♥♥♥♥♥♥garbage cake. Try this, order your squad to pile into a Humvee, then order them to drive to a specific location, for me it was literally up the road 1/4 mile, in a straight line. Now proceed to witness them drive into anything and everything that was not in that straight line. Im talking hitting walls, buildings and other vehicles, while tring to backup continuously into the brick wall behind us, despite a simple order to move ""forward"". Ok then, them driving is a no go, let us try the Helo. Some missions allow support vehicles, such as Helo transport. Call it in, it flies to your position, you pick a drop off point, it flies there. No problem. Right? Wrong, again. In the middle of clearings, I've had the chopper refuse to land to get me and my squad, I've had it crash trying to take off, or drop us off, I've even had one of my squadmates run into the rear propellar and die instantly, when all I told him to do was get in. So far, so good I suppose. However, if you find yourself more perserverant than I, and want to continue to play this game, some advice should help; -Get used to not firing your gun throughout an entire mission. Only having 5 mags may seem daunting at first, but once you realize your squad is going to most likely see the enemy before you do, they're gonna shoot them (or try to at least) first. -Battlefield veterans can recall experiences when getting sniped from across the map was frustrating, but you'd just wait for a buddy in a chopper to rain down hot 5mm hell on them. For this game, imagine every damn enemy is a sniper. Most engagements for me and my squad involve us firing at enemy ""positions"", meaning ""where we think they are"", at an average of 150-300 meters away, or just shy of 1000 feet away. Thats about 10 football fields in distance. - game deletes your saves upon completion of a mission, meaning if it didnt quite go according to plan, which is alot of this game is planning, have fun restarting the mission. --PROS---Good graphics-4 expansions-plenty of weapons/vehicles-weapon ballistics is fun to play with--CONS---Terrible AI-Game saves deleted when mission ends-Horrendous voice acting (literally can't stress this enough, although kind of remedied from expansions)-Character animations are stiff, and poor overall. -perhaps too many controlls, not for everyone.

												I can't really say anything about the story of Arma 2, nor Operation Arrowhead. I havent played them for the story, because I bought the game for Arma 2 Island life and DayZ mod. I also think this game is centered more towards multiplayer for those reasons. Although when it comes to combat, it plays out where you see them first, then you shoot them first. Arma 2 gets a 6/10.			",169,22,2,10,8,2,7

												Is ARMA II Ambitious? Yes. But you will have to seriously get used to it in order to enjoy it. Ok, Im not saying that this is a bad game. But it feels mostly unfinished. First off, the voice acting is horrendous. You know your FPS game is bad when you have some of the worst acting since Tactical Intervention. I still think Tactical Intervention's acting is worse, but this comes as a close 2nd. The game has super glitchy voice acting that feels like they just edited it all with Sony Vegas. Also, when I was playing Scenarios on single player because I wanted to get the hang on Multiplayer, When you get shot at least twice or three times, you are down. I see what they are trying to do here, it is suppose to look very realistic which Bohemia does a very good job at it, but no one will help you no matter what. Even if you try to call for help by pressing 5 and clicking and choosing which one words you want to speak out, it doesn't matter, the AI is too stupid to do anything and even if all your teammates are down, they just keep doing what they want!Also, When I first started playing, the Controls were so confusing. You had to do some stupid combinations by pressing SHIFT+U+L Or whatever which made it even more stupid. But after a few tutorials, you can easily get the hang of it. The Tutorials in the game don't even tell you which controls you have to use! You just have to be like ""OH I FRIKN PRESS THIS AND THAT!"" The Graphics and sound are fine for the most part, the sound being the most impressive thing about this game as the gun shots are very realistic sounding. But Overall, a huge disapointment. You know its a bad sign when watching gameplay of the game is better than playing it. So simulator fans and fps geeks will probably like this. But if you just want the DAYZ mod, just get the standalone version.56/100 C			",200,9,3,12,12,1,17

Missions with open wolrd style exploration granted is really easy to get lost, with the huge map, and the variaty of the encounters.You will not find many kinds of missions to play, since most of them are just kill the enemy, but some open wolrd exploration elements are enough to keep your mind off the shooting and get you ready for it.With a big multiplayer community and mod support ArmA2 es likely to live for many years in the future.If you want to try the ArmA experience i would say this is a great place to start. an in my opinion better that ArmA3			",276,58,19,30,15,3,20

												The most realistic modern military shooter you can play today. Accurate projectile ballistics, including material penetration, ranging from small-caliber handgun bullets to hellfire missiles. Wound severity based on location and type of damage, including broken bones from falling damage. Fatigue and accurate movement speeds. Fluid viewpoints and the ability to lean (who does that anymore, right?) Artillery, airstikes, long-range bullet-drop snipes, the loud and scary snaps of bullets whizzing by, the inability to confirm a kill unless you see your enemy die, and more. If you are about realism, this is the game for you8.7/10			",113,7,1,2,2,1,0

												This game is absolutly one of my all time favorite games. I reccomend this game for anyone who loves realistic shooters. You are sorely mistaken when you think there is another game more realistic than this. Of course ARMA III can be more realistic as I have yet to play that. Servers are still active and crowded with the people just getting into ARMA or people who are addicted or dedicated. The same people play the same servers which allows you to make friendships which will help you on missions that will take you across the vast map. Controls are vast due to the necessity of realism. There are hackers here and there but nothing too serious.TD;RL:GET THIS GAME! IT IS UBER REALISTIC			",138,5,1,10,13,1,20

												Although Arma 3 has come out, I still think this game with Operation Arrowhead has potentional. Yet made for multiplay its singleplayer is  very dynamic. The fact is that this is a great first person shooter. Realism is hard to balance for some games but Bohemia did great with its game content allowing players to be able to counter anything thrown at them. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a lot of game content for a unique fps.			",48,5,1,4,3,0,7

												still a sweet game, and cranked up still looks awesome (your pc still might not be able to handle it up all the way).theres still tons of people that play this online, and there are mods out that took years and years to produce.  If you dont like one style of gameplay there are several other types that are completely different and have their own independant followings and a very robust community overall despite this game having been out for years already.  Your probably already aware there are several spinoff games that have been made after mods, and many people still prefer the original versions and still play them.Personally right now i am going back with realism and sound effects mods (ace), a ai upgrade (asr), and some graphic upgrades (blastcore) and the game becomes a thing of beauty even just the normal campaign and i wish i had started off with some of these mods to begin with.  (if your just getting started id recommend a mod manager and download program called playwithsix).at this point id probably recommend getting combined ops as opposed to just vanilla, as the expansion is completely worth it in its own right.

												This game is excellent. It possesses a good game-play, albeit one that can be stiff at times but the sheer amount of customizability and flexibility of the game greatly offset this. The graphics can be rich an vibrant if you have a computer to support it. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a more realistic military shooter with some strategy and tact involved in the game-play, especially someone who enjoys looking at situations creatively.

												I'm clearly missing something with this game. I got to the free roam part and just quit. The map is so open that you have to use your pilot to travel from place to place, which in theory is cool, but just doesn't work. The pilot, Maddox, is a complete idiot and crashes his helicopter whenever i call on him, so he is unusable. Also, you die after getting shot twice, even on easy mode, and your useless teammates won't revive you and die just as easily. This game would serve better as an actual combat simulation instead of a retail game. Multiplayer isn't any better due to the stupid amount of hackers. Clearly people love this game, so i must reiterate: i'm missing something.			",96,2,0,9,11,0,43

												Now I really like this game. It's fun to play with friends, is a good challenge, and is generally really fun. You can buy a Hummer, appoint your trusted friend as the cunning witty gunner, you can go on a nice roadtrip to the objective, and then watch as everyone you have in your car is shot to bits, as you're trembling behind the stering wheel, cowering for life. NExt thing you know, you're miles behind enemy lines, trying not to take an enemies gun where the sun doesn't shine. Then your cunning witty gunner is also a cunning witty pilot.... ok nevermind, he's dead now, but ♥♥♥♥ it. It's a lot of fun to play.but the community is sogoddamnSTIFFThe amount of times i've heard the words ""you'd be court marshalled for that"" is more than I can remember! Albeit I can fix that with a poof of the ol' pistol, but it's just so annoying! HAVE SOME FUN! Wait... I see it now... back in trench warfare, soldiers stuck their helmets up with a stick to see if there are any enemies to shoot at them. This is the same thing! They hold the stiffs up with a stick up their asses to see if there are enemies! ARMA YOU ARE FABULOUS!			",165,18,0,7,19,2,7

												This is a terrible branch of Operation Flashpoint. It's touted as super-realistic, which I'm sure it is, but that doesn't equate to smooth gameplay or a fun experience for the player. If you want to play a military sim, and can deal with a clunky, dated interface, then you might like ARMA II. I wanted to give it a chance, but it reminds me of OFP (which is a good thing) but still has all the shortcomings I could do without.			",116,29,2,13,4,3,20

												It was good until the servers shut down. Now I believe you have to pay for an addon to even PLAY online! But lets not forget, I believe you can play if you somehow remembered the however long number code, or ip for each server you liked, you can play! Wow! Awesome! -_-. I don't recommend just getting Arma 2 like I did, if you want it you should probably get combined operations if you want to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aye, it were back in OA, where half my squad got killed by a single mortar from a glitched enemy. Then it was when a destroyed tank shot me in the face.

												At first, I bought this game on sale as a ten dollar day-z machine. I wasn't too sure how to run day-z, so I started up Arma 2 and decided to try this game out. It had a certain charm, that reminded me of Lone Survivor. In turn, I just started up the campaign and ended up beating it. I think that this game was certainly helpful when I finally playd DayZ because I learned many of the unique combat skills of Arma 2. My only complaint is that nobody ever gets a chance to play this game. Most people will buy this, and go play DayZ. Personally I would recommend this game to anybody who wants an actually realistic FPS game. Overall, it is probably one of my favorite games of the genre.			",134,10,1,6,9,2,4

But if you are unable to purchase OA the base game has a great campaign and awesome singleplayer modes and scenarios. *IF YOU PURCHASE OA YOU CAN GET: DayZ, Wasteland, Multiplayer, ACE/ACRE, opens up a huge amount of communities to join, other mods like JSRS, etc.Hopes this helps you decision!

If I had a good computer, I would have many hours on this. But I highly reccomend to buy it if you like realistic and stragety shooters.			",12,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Yes, I do recommend this game - but you need to know what you're getting into.""Arma 2"" is a serious simulation, not a ""shooter."" It's complex, and brutally unforgiving. Make a mistake, even a small one, and you will take the one or two bullets necessary to die. You will be fired at - very effectively - by enemies you can't see. You are probably not going to be casually taking down armored vehicles and helicopters while dismounted. The TUTORIAL can curbstomp you with vicious efficiency.Let me put it like this. ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow Of Chernobyl"" is a cakewalk compared to this title.But the game (if you can call it that) is beautiful. That is, it's beautifully crafted, with oceans of effort apparently invested in it being authentic. That authenticity - or what appears to be authenticity to a layman like me - is what makes the experience so lethal.And engaging.I barely scratched the surface of the game's content, even after putting in over 20 hours. I ended up quitting because I couldn't manage the difficulty curve, but my total experience was one of being very impressed. There's a lot to do, and a lot of freedom.I do dispute a review that says the game rewards patience. Sometimes it does, and sometimes it punishes your patience with devastating force. Then it punishes your impatience. Then it punishes your patience again. That's not a flaw. That's the nature of simulating war.The flaws that I did find were mostly related to AI and event triggers. Sometimes, what I thought would happen after issuing a certain order or carrying out a certain task is not what ended up happening. I also found the ""command"" interface to be rather strange. I made it work a fair bit, but I never really got the hang of it.Even so, I feel that this piece of software is a masterwork, and worth experiencing if you want to try something different...and something so difficult that ""Nintendo Hard"" doesn't even begin to describe the ride.

												I guess people are buying this to play DayZ or multiplayer. Fine, but I bought it for the single player, having enjoyed the OP Flashpoint series and similar. Holy hell, was I disappointed. The mission scripting is extremely buggy, involves a lot of just sitting and waiting (which may be realistic but is horrible design), the controls are horrible, the AI might as well be doing stuff completely at random and the voice acting is a complete disaster.Since the missions are so long the fact that the scripting is buggy is especially atrocious, since you may be left with no option other than to restart if you get stuck on an NPC that simply doesn't appear or an event that fails to trigger.I couldn't bring myself to finish the campaign or to try out any of the DLC, thankfully I only paid a very small sum for the whole lot. Replaying Red Rising would give me more enjoyment than trying to punch through this bug-ridden mess. Can't recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, so maybe in the future I'll write a game for Operation Arrowhead but for now this is a review on Arma 2. Honestly, don't buy this game. This is a great game with dozens of hours to play and a lot of *fun* hours, something a lot of games don't do. There are an unbelievable amount of choices in singleplayer gameplay this game has, and all are really enjoyable. LOOK AT LAST PARAGRAPH FOR WHY TO NOT BUY IT.For Arma 2's campaign, it isn't amazing, but it can be pretty fun. I really think the RPG elements they added were pretty cool, especially making this game's campaign less linear and more about random events, since that gives this game a lot of replayablility, along with like 4 different endings. The more short-term missions felt like a good scenario, but sometimes the long missions drag on a lot, adding unnecessary hours of just driving that isn't really fun. A good example is the mission ""Razor Two"", an unbelievably boring missions that takes like 3 extra hours (without a walkthrough) to get every piece of evidence and do everything. Too many of these missions have the evidence thing, and it's definitely rewarding at the end game, but when I realized what it did, I was really, really disappointed. It plays it out to be a huge thing that really affects the game, because I mean, collecting evidence of terrible war-crimes is a pretty big deal; unfortunately, it literally just gives you strong reinforcements so the last mission is easier, and that really made me feel like spending maybe an extra 5 hours on the campaign (and this campaign is short, the campaign is probably 15 hours if you don't search for evidence). Overall, this campaign isn't bad, but I don't think I'd recommend getting the game for it; it just isn't memorable.Scenarios are an entirely different story. These are pretty fun, and there are a lot of them (I think 7 of them). They are essentially a short term burst of action and fun while including some decisions that aren't necessarily long term, but rewarding. They all vary in gameplay a good amount too, giving lots of choices for gameplay style and pace. There are even some that feel like a one-man first person RTS, which is really interesting, especially since it still maintains the feeling of a sim. Overall, I strongly recommend at least trying every scenario, they are really well made and fun to play, and just feel good.Armory and Editor are shorter in descriptions, but much more in content than Scenarios and the Harvest Red Campaign so I'll group them together. The interesting thing about Armory is it really feels more like just a thing to mess around with, experiment, and get a feel for the weapons, but it can be much more than that. There are little side missiosn that you get to do that put your weapon into actual realistic situations so you can imagine its usefulness on the battlefield, which is a pretty neat thing to add. I don't personally like editor, but for anyone who has fun making levels, this is really well done. It's pretty simple to use, and it doesn't take too long to make a detailed, fun, and good mission to try yourself. Also, you can download other people's missions to judge them yourself, which can be really fun. While I don't think these are as good as the main stuff for singleplayer, but these are just fun little things to tinker with while you're bored.This doesn't really sound like I dislike this game, and I don't, I think it's amazing, but it isn't worth buying, which is really unfortunate. It really comes down to the fact that Operation Arrowhead has every single thing that I described and like 50 more hours for just singleplayer. Really, you shouldn't be buying this if you think this game looks cool, and should instead buy OA instead. This game had multiplayer removed recently (which is a huge problem, the multiplayer for this game is a lot of fun) and Operation Arrowhead actually gives not only another campaign, 7 more scenarios, and great multiplayer, it gives $8 DLCs with campaigns, scenarios, weapons, factions, and vehicles which are a ton of fun. So if you really want this game, buy OA and you'll experience what's so great about this series without spending money you didn't need to spend.			",114,10,0,18,12,1,30

												This was one of the greatest games I had played, and was my favorite FPS as well, however since the GameSpy shutdown, it's been idle. Unless you're thinking of buying this for single player, to add to your Bohemia Interactive collection of games, or to mount it on Operation Arrowhead, don't bother. The game freezes as soon as you open the multiplayer menu.And if you rate this down, you probably didn't read the full review. Imbecile.			",235,18,4,12,12,1,8

												ahhh ARMA 2... where to begin...... its a glitchy♥♥♥♥♥military simulator that somehow became super popular because of the Dayz mod. the mod itself is a perfect fit for a survival simulator and brings me back to the fun dayz when people were running around electro with makaraov's and AS50's (such fun days). but now that the dayz standalone is out the game kind of loses its purpose, unless you like the dry gameplay and screwy mechanics. it was a good game to have at the time, but now its kind of lost its pupose and has become a unwelcomed guest in my games library.

												The Basics: Military shooter with a focus on realismPrevious Time Spent: 46 minutesExpectation of learning Curve: HighWhy I bought this: The infamous Day-Z mod + a steam saleMy 3 Hours with the Game: After checking to see if any multiplayer servers were active, and finding them dead, I resigned myself to single player. I began with an intro scenario in which my compatriots and I were helicoptered in to an active battle zone, with the goal of moving about, shooting people, and holding territory. I played several other scenarios, and never gave the game the amount of effort or care needed to master it. First Impressions: This is a frightening game that alternates between somewhat boring movement, and extremely dangerous combat. Combat feels quite realistically dangerous, without any sort of health bar, or clear explanation of how injuries work. In my first firefight, I got lucky for a bit before taking a shot, and being brought down. I didn't die however, and spent some time waiting for first aid before returning to the fight. In other fights, I seemed to take injuries that caused me to bleed (at a hard to discern rate), die instantly, or be knocked down, presumably wounded. Not taking cover, or generally acting like an action hero/video game character were recipes for disaster and death. Additionally, combat tended to take place at such a long distance that it was difficult to tell where the enemy was firing from. My highlight: I eventually realized that the map covered an area much larger than my immediate combat zone, and in one of the missions decided to steal a pickup truck and leave. This actually worked, and I managed to make my way out of the combat zone (after taking a little bit of fire, resulting in a broken window). I followed the main dirt road out of the village we were supposed to be sweeping, and found myself in another village. This, and all subsequent villages were devoid of life, presumably ghost-towns fled due to the war I was taking part in. I drove some 3 km through farm villages before hitting a paved main road. From there, I drove through woods and mountains to the coast (stopping to swim in a pond). From the coast, I swam out to a small island and decided to end my 3 hour run as the unofficial lighthouse keeper of this empty country. My verdict: This game works really well at what it's trying to do, but that isn't exactly to my taste. So, I do not regret picking it up, but I can't see myself playing beyond 3 hours. Next time I'll be covering the Day-Z mod.			",103,22,0,28,7,1,25

												Arma II is good in many aspects. It is very realistic and for some can immerse you in gameplay. However it is only playable if you are willing to learn all of the commands. Many of the controls are not shown on the control page, and only appear on the tutorials once or twice that cannot be brought back up. There are so many different commands it is impossible to do anything. Instead of being able to start the tutorial, play through them once and then go right into the campaign, you need to learn the different commands for six or seven different game features that do not correlate. Driving was easy enough, but commanding tanks was confusing and flying a helecopter was impossible. Many games for PC use a minimal amount of buttons, reuse them for different mechanics, and use combinations. Arma II uses every key on the keyboard with minimal combinations and confusing menus.

												Arma2 is a richly detailed sim that makes you think... but it fails as a game. Well, it's a good sim, It's not a total loss, it can be fun, missions offer multiple ways of completing them and multiplayer is massive, but all in all its just clunky, slow, ripe with a confusing interface, controls, lackluster animations and visuals, and hasn't shaken that sim vibe off it enough for it to pull in me as a gamer. But at least what you can do in it, and what's possible, is very wide-open and varied. Who knows, perhaps I'm just not one of the ones grabbed by it. If heavy military sims are your thing though, this is right up there.			",257,74,5,20,26,3,26

												When I first got ARMA2, I went for the complete edition because I wanted to play DayZ Mod. The best deal I could get at the time was $20 for everything, which seemed like a steal. However, It didn't run well on my computer at the time. Since getting a faster computer that could handle it, and playing ARMA2 itself fluidly, I realize that it's still not a terribly fun game. Keep in mind, it is first and foremost a Military Sim. That doesn't mean that, when it comes down to combat, the gunplay isn't well done. It is! It's difficult yet satisfying to actually make a kill. However, the game still doesn't feel well pollished. Even though the controls are supposed to feel more real than FPS-ey, they work exceedingly slowly. It just makes for a bore. And when I finally got DayZ up and running, it just keeps crashing on me.If I had to suggest what to do, I'd say get the game DayZ, and if you really want a military sim, get ARMA3. It supposedly has fixed many of the glitches that this game has, as well as having extended content. This game ain't worth $20, even for each DLC and the free DayZ mod. It's worth your money to skip this and get better games. Sorry.			",149,22,1,5,5,0,14

												Bought it for the DayZ mod, love it for the DayZ mod, the DayZ mod gets a thumbs up from me. Otherwise it's just too control complex to be fun, especially (plane) flight. The beauty of a PC game vs a console game (among a long list of things) is that controls don't have to be limited to roughly 12 buttons. But seriously.... you dont need to use all 116 keys and every part of the mouse for EACH control scheme (infantry, land vehicle, helicopter, multiple types of aircraft etc.) It's near impossible to fly without a joystick. imagine, if you will, the following: A + D = roll... Yep got it. W + S = pitch ...so far so good =)... now add Q + Z = trottle up and down... ok so it's hard to bank left and use throttle, I can handle that... but wait there's more! X + C = Yaw.. so now that you're trying to make fine adjustments to properly lead and strafe you need to completely forget you're throttle because you're trying to maintain your bank to match your're adversary. but wait... turning too hard makes you loose velocity.... so stop tuning with yaw, correct speed. return to yaw. But wait there's more! F = to select your weapons, which aren't quite clear what they even are at first, until you accidentally fire one of the 2 only missles, 2 bombs, or 300 bullets you have (which you can empty in 4-5 seconds.) But wait! There's more! While you're trying to simply stay away from the ground and fumble in utter dumbfoundedness with you're weapons while trying to hit a peanut sized target with next to no ammo remaining, you moved you're mouse! Oops it controls pitch and roll too, at the same time as the keyboard! While trying to grasp all this at once you realise your landing gear is still down.... ok so now it's off the the scroll wheel menu (which is actually quite alien at first) to retract it. Now you're distracted for a few seconds from the incoming ground with your upside down aircraft seemingly resisting all your movements by about 25%. So on top of all this you now need to compensate for the resistance to your movement. Oh and remember to close/retract/lower your flaps. Whatever term the game uses is useless because you're scroll menu offers ""flaps up"" or 'flaps down"". Am i lowering them from the top of the aircraft to close them? Or was it bring the flaps from the bottom up to retract them... Oh hey, there's a note on the top right of the screen, something about using TAB to acquire targets... Wait... there were instructions there.... that's ok I'll restart again.... *reading* Welcome to the tuto... *switch* times up! new message! In this excercise we will be going to *switch*. There is litterally a 5 line message that is on screen for less than a second. Did I mention this is only the boot camp? Now lets clear something up. I LOVE complex games. From ROTK to Total War to Crusader Kings II to Europa Univeralis. I enjoy a steep learning curve because the time invested usually nets a fantastic game that not every moron can just jump on to ""pWn HiS n0oBzoRs"" or whatever it is they do. I have over 14 hours of play simply in the tutorials. I have nearly given up on the main game. But I'm a stubborn type that will keep doing it till it's done. But most people will have given up ages ago, which is a bit of a shame. The game has a fantastic engine overall and is almost unerringly realistic. If the tutorial gets a very extensive tune-up I could see many more positive reviews. But too many people are kicked flat in the teeth with this (fun but) incredibly newbie unfriendly game. Ending on a positive note thought, glitches have been non-existant to me. So I don't know if I'm just missing them out of sheer dumb luck or they have been fixed by now.			",112,25,0,24,21,1,53

												Can now be considered a classic.  I didn't get into Flashpoint as much as ARMA and ARMA II offered more than ARMA.  The benefit here is to have many contemporary units as well as the power of the editor and the scripting.  There's a lot to like about ARMA3, but ARMA2 remains a standard.  Greatest FPS/Soldier-level battle sim I know of.  I used to think the old Novalogic games were great, but then I discovered the ARMA series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has to be the most memorable MilSim in history! I say memorable because sadly the game is dead and gone, all that is left is the single player so lets get into that first. Now the start of the game throws you right into the night where positioning yourself is a critical moment, there are also back stories from the first game but i'm not getting into that because that would label this review as a spoiler. Now you control an african-american man named Cooper along with his squad mates. This story is the best ive heard of since Red Dead Redemption, and I gave that game a ten on metacritic. Now besides that this game is very VERY difficult, now i know what you're thinking: ""This game has smart AI that shoots from tiny holes? Nope, not going to buy it"". If you think that way then you're more than wrong, they use the general flanking and proning tactics that you've never EVER seen. Knowing your sorroundings is a very important lesson here. And besides going first person you can also go into third person to see you're sorroundings better. It also features a ""leaning system"" which is similar to Battlefield 4's and CoD: Ghosts leaning systems in multiplayer. The game also features different endings dependent on how you perform. The campaign took me about 6 - 8 hours to complete, but more so when you're looking for these hidden objectives. Now, lets talk about how the multiplayer was. It was FREAKING AWESOME!!! You have alot of different modes to choose from, do you want to go in with teamwork to neutralize AI enemies and seize the different towns and villages in the map? Or are you one of those resourceful and want to unleash your fury with tank combat PvP? Or would you cooperate with 3 of your friends in ""Escape Chernarus"" mode? Then multiplayer was for you. Sadly since the Gamespy shutdown the game's multiplayer is dead and gone (If you don''t count Operation Arrowhead). Now I specifically didnt purchase the game for its multi or story I actually bought it along with Combined Operations for the DayZ mod, but that is a game review for another day.Right now it deserves a 6/10 since it has only single player mode, ive heard talks about restoring the game's multiplayer but until that it needs this rating. Now, if Gamespy hadn't shutdown the game would've got a 10/10, and ive recommend it to ANYONE who thinks shooting galleries are beginning to get old.This game had potential, until the final nail got into its coffin. However, if you realy want multiplayer then wait for a sale on this game along with Operation Arrowhead, Bohemia has restored the OA's multiplayer thanks to steam's multiplayer system.

												This might not be your game if the only fps' you play start with ""battlefield"" or ""call,"" unless you only play on hardcore modes. If you like military sims, then this is the quintessential experience. You can devote endless hours playing this game with nearly endless options. BI supports it's modding community and it is very expansive. They also occassionally have cash prizes for mods. Unfortunately the modding community isn't well represented in steam workshop, but downloading mods from BI's forums isn't difficult. There are some intuitive control issues with the UI, but it's forgivable. I wish I had more time to give this game so I could join a group that plays regularly, like ShackTac.As of right now A2 has more mods and a bigger crowd playing it due to the mods, in comparison to A3.

You'll need more keys than you have brain cells to properly play THIS game! But wait... you're here for Day Z, aren't you? Well in that case, slip on those checkered slip-ons, button up that coffee-stained flannel, and run a comb through that greasy mess of hair you have resting on that pretty little head of yours.

												This game is now dead but you still need it for op arrowhead annd dayz and such. op arrow is still played but everyone is now moving to arma 3. Why do they move to arma 3. I have no clue i think arma 2 is still good and they should sill be played equally.			",91,8,0,8,16,0,7

												Arma II is a great game filled with awesome moments! The only downside to owning Arma II is that finding servers with the version of Arma II that you have is very difficult, and to play most servers that are on Arma II you must have Arma II Combined Operations. Overall I rate Arma II a 6.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is by far the best along with Arma 2 Operation arrowhead. Way better then  Call of Duty. They also have a better community then COD and free roaming while on a huge team. Zombies on Day Z id way better then Call of Duty's zombies as well.			",64,8,0,3,13,0,9

												It's okay.  I don't enjoy playing with random people so I only do so with those I know. We tried this and while it looks good, we just felt it was wrong for us.  There were times we just felt it was too difficult for two people to enjoy by themselves.  We appreciated the realism but it was clear to us that this wasn't for us. I'm not saying it's a bad game at all. I am just saying if you just want a military shooter that you can enjoy solo or co-op with one friend, then this might not be something you'd enjoy.  So for those I cannot recommend this game.If you're looking for a more realistic game than say...Battlefield, this might be something for you.			",109,6,17,44,9,0,30

												ARMA II is a very realistic MilSim Game for the pc. You have a choice of playing Single Player or Multiplayer. In Single Player not only can you play Campaign, but you can also test Vehicles, Weapons, Creatures,  and more. The teams are BluFor, OpFor, Independent, and Civilian. You can also play as one of those four teams in Armory. Also in Armory you can be assigned challenges. The challenges are, Steal The Item, Assasination, Taxi, Shooting Range, Kill House, and more.

												overall, i like the realism, i  like the game as a whole, id reccomend it, but... i can't, i just cant, no no NO JUST NO!Requirements are a lie considering i pass the max and every time i attempt to run  it it runs like complete garbage!the key thing to enjoying a game is for it to run properly, as advertised, without absurd game breaking glitches, horrid graphical glitches, absurd reasonless lag considering how i pass the ""maximum requirements"" when you launch a mission and you start in a humvee and instead you are floating in the air incapable of doing anything then said humvee explodes killing you........ i dont even need to explain...... ok maybee that time i had a perfectly rendered us soldier standing next to a nintendo 64 rendered soldier that was exactly the same as him... nope still no need to explain........

												More of a military simulation than a first-person shooter, ARMA 2 is not for everyone. I found it quite tedious. If you want to shoot things, play something else. If you want to sit through mission briefings so you can spend a couple of hours walking around and not shooting things, play this.			",206,24,0,50,8,1,22

												Do yourself a huge favor unless you like the idea of joining any armed forces: DON'T BUY THIS GAME OR ANY VARIATIONS OF THIS GAME. Games are supposed to be fun. Scratch that, THIS IS NOT A GAME, THIS IS A SIMULATOR Arma is far from fun, it is more like a strategic jerk fest of Army Reservist veterans running around shaking hands with their guns. If you have a perversion for being bossed around, like being sniped by someone miles away and dying in jack♥♥♥♥istan, or enjoy virtual reality p.t.s.d. than this is the sixty dollar game to wallow yourself in and rethink your life choices. Online gameplay is made up of from 9gagers, those turned down by the armed forces, maween canidates for human shields, weeaboos, and the one poor sap that was tricked into thinking this was a video game. See Lay-Z for a ctrl c+ctrl v generic zombie maween ♥♥♥♥fest shooter. Overall score: Don't touch this abomination with a 100 ft pole.			",157,7,1,8,6,2,1

												ARMA 2 depicts real militry gear very accurately.Arma 2's command menu is partially hidden, and won't initially display all options as in ARMA CWA / OFP and ARMA 1 / Armed Assault. AI in ARMA 2 have trouble deciding on stance and maintaining formation, often running out in front of a player like Left4Dead AI teammates. In addition to isuing commands, the player can switch between units similar to Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon. Single player can be frustrating because of the bad AI, so if you want a better single player experience get ARMA Cold War Assault or ARMA 3.			",192,18,0,20,24,0,45

												OK I may have done a review earlier, but I didn't give it the credit it deserves. It's hard to put it in words. The campaign is alright, and the scenarios are fun, but the multiplayer is what it must be like in real combat. It's not this Call of Duty♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's watching planes scream over head and hearing tanks rolling by, not knowing where the enemy will be next. But the build your own mission, it's like coordinating an army, then fighting along side them. You feel a certain pride you get no where else as an A10 Warthog screams over head, dropping bombs on a target you marked. Or capturing an airfield with just you and your buddy. Pros-Petty OKRealistic gunplayRealistic combatFunCons-Clunky animationsbad Voice ActingNeed a beastly PCSeriously, it's like Skyrim and Battlefield 3 combined. Can't even wait to see how friggin awesome Arma III is gonna be. Guys. Buy this. Or Arma 3Seriously, I can't even describe the feeling this game gives you. Remember, BUILD YOUR OWN MISSION. It's much more fun. And more badass. Link to a tutorial-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plzPQ5qfXWcWatch all the parts and youll figure it out. BUY THE GAME. ITS AMAZING!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I originally made this review when it was easy to play. Now it's different. My opinion hasn't changed about the play style, but a more important thing that this game is based around. If you're looking for a tactical military shooter involving Russia and the United States, you've come to the right place.Pros:+Authentic Vehicles and Weapons+Tactical+Multi-player+Good Community+SingleplayerCons:-Most Multiplayer Servers shut down when GameSpy shut down (So it's difficult to get into a server)-Some hackers and cheaters (like every game)-Bugs/GlitchesThere's not much else that I can remember about this game, because I haven't played in so long after the GameSpy shut down. I remember that the servers aren't as good as they used to be, there isn't as many gamemodes. If I can remember, the one remenence of Arma 2 in the game is the singleplayer and the DayZ type servers that are still standing. The game is practically dead, but it's still is a fun game based off of what it was like. If I were you, get the current Arma. It has what Arma 2 had, and more!			",110,4,7,5,11,1,5

												ArmA II is the most realistic military shooter when it wants to be. Unless you go onto some super professinal server where everyone is shouting orders into their mics, this game will end up being more silly then real. The in-game editor is where it all happens. While some people will waste months making super-realistic missions that are so detailed you'd think the devs made it, most others like myself just ♥♥♥♥ around in the editor. Spawn 100+ F-15's and hop into one. Spawn 100+ C-130's and watch them all crash into each other. Spawn as a cow. Spawn 200 soldiers. 100 US, 100 RU. Now, this game has intense detail and a HUGE map, so unless your machine is fairly good, you'll have a very laggy time. Their are countless things you can do to the files to make your game run faster, I mean, my ""Machine"" is a 2010 Toshiba laptop for Christ's sake and I can run it at about 35-45 FPS.

												Feels like the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥final exam project from a couple of high school kids. They tried to do too much with the controls and ended up sucking horribly at every single possible thing. I can't even tell you how many missions are in the game, because a seemingly unavoidable glitch happens during the very first one.The only reason to get this game is for DayZ... and DayZ requires so many updates (and fixes and balancing to stop sucking so ♥♥♥♥ing much) that I can't even connect to any servers anymore because there's too many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ different versions of it that none of them work anywhere for me anymore.That said... DayZ is planned to be standalone. So don't buy this. Save your money like I should have. It's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It really, truly sucks.			",181,18,0,40,37,1,40

												It's worth putting up with a few bugs and clunky mechanics for some truly great unique one of a kind moments but if you aren't getting an Arma game for DayZ Mod skip this and get Operation Arrowhead instead as it's Arma 2 but with online, better faces and slightly better performance. Still worth getting to access it's content as the Arma 2 and it's expansions link up. Great memorable locations with a wide variety of weaponry and a great community make this worthwhile so long as you have a nice PC and some patience. The same applies for Dayz mod.My Arma: Cold War Assault review can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/65790My Arma: Gold Edition review can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/65780My Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead review can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/33930My Arma 3 review can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/107410 ",246,13,3,8,1,0,2

												Don't get this game. I bought it after reading reviews and reading all the hype about it. However, it has an extremely clunky and hard to navigate interface. This, combined with the poor graphics and general lack of quality, make the game a waste of money. It's also extremely easy to get lost almost immediately in the game. Overall, its not worth the money. Don't waste your time on this game unless you're in to old shooters.			",84,4,1,13,0,0,15

												The reason i do not recommend this game is bacause almost every time i join a server it kicks me. Another reason is that there are SO MANY controls. Theres controls to the arrow keys that doesent make any sense at all. Then theres another control wear u have to hold alt to look around while your driving and walking. And the helicopter controls are HORABLE. I do not know how to fly it much. Most of my play time im trying to figure out the controls or not knowing what to do. Then the campain is probley the lazyest thing ive seen in my life. And thats why i do not like this game.			",40,2,0,1,1,0,0

												Here's what I'll say, my negative feelings towards this game are mainly based on personal preferrence.Now, many, and I'd even argue most, players buy this game for the DayZ mod. If you're going to buy it, try to watch a few let's plays beforehand and learn how the game works. Otherwise, you might wind up like me.In my opinion, I really don't like this game. The interface is terrible, the game responds really slowly, the controls are bad, and it's impossible to get into. Above all that, the engine is complete crap. I don't know how to put it any other way than, ""Playing this game feels like trying to steer a boat through molasses.""It's not that it runs poorly on my computer, either. It just feels slow and clunky, and that's why I find this game nearly unplayable. I had a few laughs in it's DayZ mod, but the thrill wears off quickly as you find that the same problems plaguing the base game are even worse in DayZ.			",189,23,1,29,26,3,39

If you are using a shiny pan, 375.Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on.Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter.For the batter:.Make sure everything is at room temperature.Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight.Release the sides of the springform.Eat.			",88,27,1,15,30,3,17

												I know this game i supposed to be a very realistic military simulator, but I find it extremely slow. The lack of instruction during the multiplayer, leaves me with about an hour of trying to figure out my controls. Also, during multiplayer I've spent a lot of it just driving to my objective and when I arrive there's no action and I'm left with another long trek to repeat the same process. Also, it's incredibly resource greedy. I'm getting a solid 24 fps and any given time, and the game still looks like doo-doo. And this is a computer that runs BF3 at around 100 fps. All in all, I can see why it is such a entising franchise, but personally I'm going to have to not recommend it. I'm glad I paid only $2.49 for it. I would recommend this game to anyone willing with a somewhat higher than avergae intelligence to understand and learn all of the functions and elements of them game. Otherwise go play some battelfield or something.P.S. I have over an hour played (76 minutes).			",30,0,0,2,3,0,0

												ARMA II is for those individuals who are unable to join the military due to their lack of physical fitness or their attraction for the genitals of someone of the same gender as them. With it's clunky, overly complex controls, ARMA II might as well ship in-packaging with a Moog synthesizer to even begin to appreciate the sub-par gameplay experience this ""simulator"" has to offer. To a certain extent, I can understand the appeal to hyper-realistic first person shooters, though, when you're required to hold your character's hand through the entire experience of firing his rifle, you might as well assist him in rubbing peanut butter on his testicles and beckoning his dog into the room with him. Then assisting him to pat the dog on it's head whilst you reassure him that his wife will never find out, and the dog won't remember.If you love reading maps, playing typing games, or even cleaning your bathroom, GI Joe Simulator 2009 is the game for you. Otherwise, I recommend torrenting Duke Nuke 'Em: Forever, installing it, and then uninstalling it, whilst you think of something better to waste your time on.			",50,7,6,5,10,0,6

												The engine is very old and outdated, and even with Bohemia constantly updating and optimizing the game, it still runs poorly on modern computers. They stretched the engine to the very limits, but it's just too old to do much with.As for the gameplay, the engine is still holding the game back. Compared to modern gameplay (and even real military combat) it's really slowpaced and clunky to control. The shooting mechanics are pretty in-depth and fairly fun though, but you will often find yourself getting killed with little indication simply because of the failures of the engine. There is little feedback in this game; shooting someone causes no movement or any kind of indication of pain or disability, so it's incredibly hard to tell if you are hitting and doing any real damage some times until they fall down with the prone animation or the death animation. You almost immediately notice just how many work-arounds they had to implement to get the engine to do what they want, sort of like how Blizzard had to work around their old engine for WoW.As for the simulation side of things: it's probably the best you'll ever get to a fun simulation of combat without playing those really cheesey and un-fun military simulators out there. The game can be as realistic as you want, since you have to set the rules for yourself. Want military-grade training and cooperation with a heavy dose of roleplay? You might be interested in ShackTac. Want to just mess around and have fun without much serious RP? There are tons of those, but I recommend getting friends to play with for this.Over all, the game is really showing its age even though it isn't that old. The technology wasn't ready for a game of this scale when it was released, and it shows, not to mention the really bad engine.But despite these things, I think it's safe to say that this game is the most fun you can have in a cooperative video game. There is nothing like playing ACE with 3-7 friends on missions meant for 20-30 people. There is nothing like assaulting militia bases in Takistan with 3 of your best mates, going up against the odds well into the morning. There is no feeling similar to what you can get when you organize your close friends to all install ACE mod and playing it for the first time, helping eachother out of the ropes.I can't recommend this game to anyone anymore, as ARMA III is now here and there is no reason to play this game anymore since the mods have all been updated for the new game. But rest assured: this game will always have a place deep in my heart.I only have a few hours played here because there's no reason to launch ARMA II over Operation Arrowhead.			",85,5,1,7,7,0,20

												If the CallofDuty & BattleField series leave you hungry for something much more realistic, try ARMA. However, it does have many flaws, including an overly complex difficult interface, advanced but very inconsistent and cheating AI, and a lot of serious bugs. The singleplayer is somewhat broken (if only they would do it like in the original Operation Flashpoint). Multiplayer was once the main appeal, but now few people play online, and it was always very vulnerable to hacking. But there is still nothing quite like ARMA. Graphics are excellent, but you need a very powerful PC for smooth gameplay.			",54,7,0,5,1,0,2

												This review is all done after initially playing about 5 hours of said game.I don't believe I have ever had a more confusing experience. I really wanted to like this game. It's extremely ambitious in design and looks pretty solid in areas. Modes such as Armory are relatively fun and grand in scope; however, playing the game is a frustrating experience. The controls are very strange and do not come to the player easily. You have to fiddle around with it to get it to your liking, which is easier said than done. Think about most first person shooter games with their controls: now remove aspects of sensitivity and general feeling of control on the weapon. I had a problem on more than one occassion where I died because I could not aim at the enemy at all. After going through the control menu, I selected a lock-on control scheme. The only way I could manage to hit anything is with this mode, and I'm questioning if I am simply stupid or the game is too buggy. Another problem I have is picking up weapons; it's very slow, and causes certain games (DayZ) to be incredulously hard to play because you end up getting caught off guard trying to get a weapon that you can't aim anyway. There are multiple views (third and first), and first person view is relatively hard on the eyes as the head bob on it is ridiculous (you can set it lower); I find myself more comfortable with the third person view, which gives a bigger picture anyway.The worst thing I encountered in ArmA II (or any of its other games) is that it simply isn't fun. I never felt like anything was going to plan, that almost everything I did was hindered by the control. Perhaps if I had a controller, the game would respond better. Another big deal is the bugs within the game; they constantly appear, from minor ones as texture problems to really big bugs such as your helicopter flipping over randomly to kill you, lock the screen, and cause you to bring up task manager to get out of the game.The frustration does not end there for me. I also wanted to get in on the DayZ Mod, which conveniently has a download on Steam. This download is not an updated version however, and is completely and utterly incompatible with 99% of online DayZ servers. So, you have to download a completely separate mod, DayZ Commander, to update all of your ArmA II games/DLC and also download updates to the DayZ mod, and then you can finally play a game. Great, right?Wrong. Most servers seem to require something called ""DayZ Epoch"", another mod of a mod that you need to download. An extra 400mb on.So you get that done, and you're ready. It's too bad that the mod has the exact same flaws as ArmA II that I listed above. I struggle to hit ANYTHING, and if I don't have a weapon, finding one while zombies attack you is next to impossible. The atmosphere is pretty cool, and the immersiveness is great, but it just doesn't seem to work at all for me. I do note here that the creators of ArmA II did not create the DayZ mod, but I have it here for reference due to the fact a great deal of players buy this game to play this mod.In conclusion, I do not recommend this game; I dislike it for many reasons. If you feel like you can deal with a lot of frustration and can look past multiple issues within a game, then this is for you. I wanted to love this, as it offers a lot, but my experience with it has been bad and I wish it wasn't.Wait until your friend gifts you this, or try it out before you spend your money. Don't regret buying a game you cannot refund.Graphics: 8/10 ""Graphics are sound. Texture issues are common for me. Other than that, it is very good.""Gameplay: 4/10 ""Lack of real control in weapons and in vehicles. Helicopters sometimes bug out and flip completely over, and one time caused my game to completely lock up for no apparent reason.""Overall Fun: 3/10 ""I tried desperately to have some semblance of fun in this game, but I barely got that. Armory mode is the most fun I had with this game, and it barely delivers.""Total Average: 5/10My apologies to the developers, but this simply was not my cup of tea. If it were not for the hard to handle control scheme this would be much higher. Perhaps it's me that is stupid, but I don't believe so.EDIT 18/1/2014: I got a controller and attempted to play it to give it another chance, hoping something would be different. It was actually worse. Sensitivity and control is so bad, I literally either miss the target, accidentally hit one, or (and most of the time) get killed before I can manage to aim at a target. Don't even say  that ""you're not giving it enough time"" because I'm just so tired of the crap controls, annoyed at the constant bugs, frustrated with the lack of instruction, and I am just generally regretting this purchase. Consider this game a 4/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ARMA II and its engine in general are pretty bad. The controls are terrible. The graphics are poor. It's in no way better than BF3 or BF4 (or any previous Battlefield game IMO) in terms of military simulation FPS games.I originally recommended this game because of the DayZ zombie apocalypse mod that was extremely popular for a while. Since DayZ has moved to a standalone version which is currently in alpha stage, the ARMA II DayZ servers are poorly maintained now and are full of rampant hacking and other exploitation and stupidity.If you're looking for that sort of game, either buy into the DayZ alpha on Steam or check out Rust on Steam, as well.

												Even though this game is realistic when it comes to warfare, it requires a high-end computer to run. Having an average computer won't cut it, even with the lowest graphic setting. I give this game a 3.2/10 mainly because the graphics and the quality suck, but the realism plus the Day-Z addon (which also lags just as bad) doesn't make up for it.

												Building on 10 years of constant engine development, ARMA II boasts the most realistic combat environment in the world. It models real world ballistics & round deflection, materials penetration, features a realtime day/night cycle and dynamic wind, weather and environmental effects. The simulation of a combat environment is so effective, the engine forms the basis for training simulators used by real armies the world over. Although ARMA II is set in the fictional ex-soviet state of 'Chernarus' the gameworld is actually a 225 square kilometer chunk of the real world! ARMA II's highly detailed landscape is a meticulous facsimile of real terrain, modeled using extensive geographical data. This recreated region is brought to life with spectacular environmental effects and populated with dynamic civilian settlements and wildlife. Wild animals roam the atmospheric forests while the people of Chernarus try to live out their lives among the war-torn streets. The 27th U.S. Marine Expeditionary Unit have been deployed to the former soviet country of Chernarus in this third installment in the series of award winning PC war simulators from Bohemia Interactive, creators of Operation Flashpoint*: Cold War Crisis and ARMA: Combat Operations. Force Reconnaissance Team Razor are among the first to fight. This elite five-man team are about to fall down the rabbit hole, trapped in a war not only for control of the country, but the hearts and minds of its people.

												Very advanced and filled with potential for modding and such, but the base game is not fun at all. The controls alone have a massive learning curve, actually using 90% of the keyboard. Do not buy this game expecting anything like a modern FPS, expect more of a flight simulator for war. Very realistic, and in that, boring (little action) compaired to the rest of the FPSs out there.			",95,2,1,11,6,0,7

												The game is good if you like a full ''realistic experience''.If you have firends to play with buy it. If not well, its your choice.I like the realism in game from time to time but meh, in solo i didn't had too much fun. But to remind you, this is just my opinion.			",205,15,0,15,8,2,18

												This game is great from what i've seen, apart from the one thing that is preventing me from playing it.The Graphics are O.K. I am Complaining because the Controls are the worst controls ive EVER seen. i can hardly shoot, run, or even move without being frustated at this.  ARMA's controls should be a bit more ike battlefields or CODs the it would proboly beat these games hand down for player experience, but the controls are a massive letdown. I WOULD NOT ADVISE buying this game.P.S: i have played more time (about 2.5 hrs) on this game, but it hasn't build up.			",103,3,0,11,12,0,10

												This game is terribly buggy, unoptimized to the core, needlessly slow and infantry movement makes you feel like you have a refrigerator tied to you back at all times. When there are mods like Project Reality for Battlefield 2 out there, which provides a much better experiance, this game isn't worth the price. As for the DayZ mod, in my experiance it is just ARMA II, but with slow, unthreatening zombies thrown into the mix and weapons hidden throughout the map. Keep in mind most of my experiance with ARMA II was with Operation Arrowhead and the DayZ mod, so my 0.6 hours on the original game doesn't really apply.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ehhh...not impressed.  I bought this game on sale (thankfully!) but I barely got past the tutorial.  Why?  Well, where do I begin?  Let's start with these few complaints: 1) the objective markers on screen are not only very faint, but they are almost the same color as the background.  So it's REALLY hard to see where you are supposed to be headed.2) not only are the controls not very intuitive, but...3) the controls are also totally OVER-WHELMING (so many damn commands there aren't enough buttons on the keyboard...literally!  Commands need to be double-keyed -- for example: tap x to perform this action, double-tap x to perform this action, press and hold x to perform this action, etc, etc.)  It's ridiculous.4) graphics are mediocre; not terrible, but not definitely great either.I could list more complaints, but that would probably qualify this review as ""a rant"", so I'll spare you.  In any case, for this game I'll say: Don't waste your money.  Just my two cents...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your in the neighborhood for a good F.P.S and your thinking ""well geeze I enjoyed Modern Warfare and Battlefield series so I'm sure Arma is right up my alley"" think again. THIS GAME IS NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL!  It is very much a simulator and a very frustrating one for those (like me) who have never played a war sim before. I'm sure this would have been a great game if I had gone into it with the right mindset, but as it is this game just frustrates the hell out of me. If you like infuriating controls , endeless inventory and control screens and the worst voice acting in the history of games, than this thing is for you!Totally impressed by the scope of the maps (bordering on M.M.O style of map size)and the game physics are awesome....but it just didn't do it for me.Great community though.

												Lets see here.Controls are about as intuitive as holding a really slippery bar of soap with your elbows in that you have to go through ten menus to pick up a gun or get in a tank. Character moves like he's got concrete for feet. Aiming does nothing. NPC enemies are psychic. Did i mention the ♥♥♥♥ing menus? And you have to do that under fire. And then slog ten miles. The UI literally tells you nothing about where to go. I like freedom in games. But no direction at all is worse than extreme linearity.Graphics look like something from 2000 even on highest settings. Characters phase through doors. People have no emotion. The facial animation can be out done by a sock puppet. Characters also have these horrfying souless eyes. Sound is just...bland.Back to the combat. Even on easy your character can barely take a wad of spit before the bones in his legs suddenly turn into powder. And good ♥♥♥♥ing luck getting an NPC medic to help, since he's off picking his nose with the barrel of his gun.So no. Don't even bother. Call of Duty is at least entertaining for ten minutes. This just isn't entertaining at all. Its confusing and frustrating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has multiple endings contingent on multiple triggers per level that require a precise alignment of the stars to all flag even if you've done everything right.

												Arma II is a commendable game on many levels.  It is open, it tries to be realistic, and in many ways it succeeds.  There are plausible scenarios, tons of weapons, interesting views and tactics.  But.  The UI is clunky, the controls are clunky the feel of the game itself is clunky and needlessly complex.  On top of these points, the dialogue and music are hardly compelling, in fact, they are like cheese on a soggy pizza.  Yes, it's technically pizza, and pizza is good, but this is some bad cheese.  The best part about Arma II is that you can mod Arma II.  You can add extra toppings to make the whole thing a little more palatable.  Can I recommend Arma II as a buy that is used to create a fun gaming experience?  Absolutely.  Can I recommend it as a stand-alone product?  Unlikely.  This review reflects Arma II as a standalone game, and as a standalone piece of software it gets a 6.8/10.  Mediocre at best despite its grand aspirations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arma 2 review..... Kinda. After playing 114 minutes of Arma2 I realize now why I got it for $4 on a Steam sale. It's so amazingly clunky and buggy it's almost impossible to hit anything. Felt like I was playing an alpha version. Not to mention the controls are so weird I don't even know where to begin. One of the few impressive things about this game is map and terrain size, as the game environments are massive. But besides that, the dialogue and interface for issuing commands to my team were barely functional since my team acts like drunken, glitched out morons that often caused me to fail objectives. The graphics are total crap on default settings, and I was only able to play on maxed settings to see anything more than 3 feet infront of me. By default everything is like looking through someone else's glasses that make everything super blurry. I had to max everything out to see the textures clearly without any blurring. But what I saw looked more like they were intentionally blurry, and there's no way that can seriously be the way the game is intended to be played. Maybe there are other great things about this game, but I'm not willing to go that far yet since I have many more games to play on my list. Perhaps I'll revisit this game at a later date. But for now, I'm not going to wander into megaglitchland again for a while. Sorry for the negative review. Arma II: 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a terrible game. I want to like it and I really want to play it.But the interface is one of the worst I have ever seen in my 20+ years of gaming.The input lag on the mouse is one of the first things that caused me to never want to ""get into"" the game. It makes it so hard to play. My system can run this 7+ year old game on max, but the gfx are terrible, even for their time. I understand they needed more rendered at a time for the larger viewing distances. But they skimped a little too much. And this is no excuses for the local ""close to the player"" textures being so low detail and low general quality.The indisputable, non-industry standard control scheme makes the game unplayable. The hints that show up the first time you run through the game are too hard to notice and disappear before you had a chance to read them, or test that control. The creators choosing not to use the space bar for jump is not okay. The constant excuse of ""This is a simulation, its too realistic for you! If its too hard, go back to CoD. N00b!"" ""Their control scheme is part of what sets the game apart."" Is right along the same lines as Apple removing the headphone jack from their phones, and all the USB A ports and MagSafe port from their MAC Book Pro. Its not edgy or progressive, its just very annoying and difficult to deal with. It seems that the ARMA II community is less willing to hear about and suggest any fixes for the games problems, and more willing to FLAME the thousands who have mentioned these issues. I have read the excuse ""This is a simulation, not a game."", touted by every fan boy, hundreds  of times now. This excuse is used the majority time they need to defend the game against a genuine problem or technical issues that, honestly, shouldn't have been there. Well let me help you out a bit. Are you PLAYING this on your PC, is there no physical effort or risk to yourself? And do you actually learn real tactics, logistics, firearms operation, actual military radio communication rules, tactical or group vehicle operation, etc.? No? I hate to break it to these fan boys, but: THIS IS NOT A SIMULATION. IT IS A PC GAME! If you want to claim you were in a military or similar simulation, you need to get off your corpulent, arm-chair commando, un-educated (in such matters) posteriors and actually: Join the Military, Participate in some of their publically accessible education programs, Take some actual training somewhere, Etc. Or you could just stop pretending that this game is a simulation and that it ""taught"" you anything at all, other than how to play another PC game. A terribly made game at that.The controls are not intuitive at all. If this were meant to actually be a simulation then I could easily switch my weapons fire mode with no thought. At the bare minimum, a simulation should be teaching you how to do this. (Like I can in real life. No thought. If I need to change the fire mode on my AR, I just move my right thumb to flip the selector on the left side of my rifle). But the game doesn't actually teach you anything real. So stop claiming that this is a ""Super realistic military simulation"". It's not.This review was sparked by a completely terrible experience when attempting to play this game. There are a LOT more issues I didn't cover here because there are too many for me to address. Just Google it, you will quickly get your fill. I would NEVER recommend this game to anyone else. At least not with out a full briefing on the quality and status. ",142,22,2,3,16,1,13

												I bought this game and the Operation Arrowhead expansion just to play DayZ. Yet I decided to give the game a try since I owned it.It was probably one of the worst campaigns I've ever played.My friend and I wanted to do co-op and play through it. It was one of the most buggy games ever. There were times where a cutscene was happening and it would just freeze or kick him out of the game. The AI was even worse. Sometimes they'd stand there and shoot at you for 30 seconds and not hit you, or kill you within 3 seconds. The voice acting was so bad. It made us both laugh anytime anyone said anything. It was that terrible. It did have some cool elements. Like after a few missions, being able to travel the entire map searching for something. Using whatever vehicle and even calling in a helicopter to give rides. When the AI helicopter pilot worked that is. It often landed on a roof or would just hover there staring at you.Overall, this game doesn't look pretty, isn't optimized, is buggy and doesn't offer too much in terms of solid gameplay.

												I played Arma 3 before I played this, that was probably a bad idea because my expectations were set too high for Arma 2.  Although the game initially starts off to be quite fun, I got to Mission 7 (Manhattan) and the mission was just so glitchy, things weren't there that were supposed to be there, the game randomly decides to let you complete a mission or not let you and in most cases this means you have to completely restart the mission again which you have just spent hours on.Don't buy this, download it on a torrent if you must but I recommend playing Arma 3 instead, much better game and much much more stable.

												Look...this is a fine game.  Certain people will say it is the greatest game out there.  It's realistic, strategic, and all those things I wanted as a kid who had all the time in the world to perfect a game.  Turns out that as an adult I can't handle this type of game anymore.I bought it to play DayZ a long time ago and found the same thing there.  If you're looking to play the mod, be sure to understand what it is (and more importantly understand what you really want) before picking it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Realistic war game simulation, enough said. If you are shot, you WILL die. If you are being healed it WILL take forever. If you shoot a gun it WILL make a sound. Games like Battlefield or Call of Duty simply can't compare to this game when it comes to realism. Sadly, if your the type of person that likes a fast paced game, then Arma II, and REAL LIFE, are not going to be your cup of tea. Look elsewere. However, Slight bonus. If you buy Combined Operations, you get access to a free Mod known as DayZ. This is a Realistic zombie survival simulation. Its very fun and adrenaline pumping at times, even more so with friends or Team Speak. However, patience is a virtue NEEDED in this game. You WILL die. You WILL lose all your gear. You WILL be robbed by other players and killed. And you WILL break your legs, Bleed out, run out of ammo, etc. etc. etc. Hope you enjoy. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arma II is a fantastic military simulator. There is no game out there that is quite like it, or comes even close to its realism. It is slow paced, but thats what makes it so fantastic. You can make it fast paced if you want to though, but if you want fast just go play Call of Duty. The editor adds so many possiblites and the mods are amazing! I reccomend ACE mod for even more fun. So many possibilities, so much fun! I reccomend playing it with friends and go try hard! This awesome open world fps simulator recieves a 9.5/10 from me.

												As long as you have a computer that can support it, then it's a awesome game. The action itself, where you go on and try to complete missions, takes some getting used to, and you'll often die for your first couple tries. But if you beat, or quit the missions, there's a editor just around the corner. Create your own missions, test out scenarios, or just have fun. A favorite of mine is to spawn in 30 or so jets flying above me all at once, watch them fight for airspace and crash into nearby buildings and trees. Would recommend to anyone with a computer that can handle it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like anything to do with war wether its tanks, guns, armor, helicopters, this game has every thing you could imagine about war. I found this game hard to get used to because of the complex contols but once mastered is loads of fun.(I would not recomend this title to people who dont have a beefed up pc because Arma is massive and its no fun if its laggy, so dont spend all that money if you can run somthing like TF2 very well.) My recommendations for the bundle of arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrow head is that its worth the money because you can install Dayz onto it for free which is a huge must have in the pc gaming world. Im not sure what the exact size of arma 2, arma 2 operation arrow head, Dayz together but i highly recommend it.			",88,3,0,6,5,0,2

												Possible the BEST game ever, restricted to Action, Simulation, Military and shooter. The best game engine in games history, 10 years of Game Engine developtment supplied the Arma II-III games. Best graphics in any shooter game that I know. From very close to realistic, all down to where you can run Arma II with a very bad PC. The highest graphics needs (minimal) a Titan graphics card, and an i10 processor. Even on the lowest graphics, the game does not look horrible.  The Arma II series comes with the ""Complete Edition"" to under 20£. And it's very worth it.9/10 overall, it would have been a 10 if the animation were better, it's the best game I have ever played. Definetely worth the money. Actually go buy it now. Go.If you want to see gameplay of Arma II, and the beutiful mod, DayZ, check out my channel on YouTube!http://www.youtube.com/user/SuperMClone ",39,2,0,3,6,0,10

												Without a doubt this is the best war simulator money can buy. I didnt get too involved with the story mode, because the real fun to be had is with multiplayer. Servers like Evolution Blue/Red really bring the best out of the game. Showing you how you can use teamwork and different classes and tactics to take down your opponent. This is nothing like COD because with this you cant just run behind enemy lines and get a bunch of kills and respawn half way across the tiny map and just run back. With Arma you need a plan and teamwork. You cant just send in a bunch of bombers to destroy the target, you need to take out the AA's who threaten the air support first then you have to let the ground infantry do it's job and take out any main targets you need to complete the mission then you can bomb the area but first you have to get the troops out. This isn't very easy and the hardest part is working together with others to do this. But if done right Arma will get you very involved and will make you feel like your on the front lines and it's all or nothing. Overall if you want a good War Simulator this is the game to buy.

												Realistic war game simulation, enough said. If you are shot, you WILL die. If you are being healed it WILL take forever. If you shoot a gun it WILL make a sound. Games like Battlefield or Call of Duty simply can't compare to this game when it comes to realism. Sadly, if your the type of person that likes a fast paced game, then Arma II, and REAL LIFE, are not going to be your cup of tea. Look elsewere. However, Slight bonus. If you buy Combined Operations, you get access to a free Mod known as DayZ. This is a Realistic zombie survival simulation. Its very fun and adrenaline pumping at times, even more so with friends or Team Speak. However, patience is a virtue NEEDED in this game. You WILL die. You WILL lose all your gear. You WILL be robbed by other players and killed. And you WILL break your legs, Bleed out, run out of ammo, etc. etc. etc. Hope you enjoy. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun game. The down fall is that you need a true gaming PC to play this game. Very war like. Its based of an army simulator and very intense. If you were ever going to join the army, this is the game i suggest you play. This is also part of the DayZ mod. There is a collecters pact where you can get Arma 2 operation arrow head, whitch is also needed to play DayZ. But i fully suggest you buy this buy this game!			",72,3,1,6,6,1,5

												If you want a game all about strats and teamwork. This is it. You command your squad to assist you through battles and conquer the various missions and DLC this game has to play. This graphics are good for its time. And it rt-uns perfectly if you have the right stats. The online multiplayer can be slow depending on what type of server you're playing on. But once you get the hang of the complex and somewhat annoying controls the game actually turns out to be extremely fun and interesting.			",350,61,6,39,31,5,60

												Alright, where do I start?Well, Arma 2 features good graphics and unforgettable gameplay, tactical planning is required for this game. If you are a former Call of duty addict, this game is not for you. ;PTo play this game, you need to think 'now if there is a tank there, and artillary there, how can I get my men to capture that camp with the least possible casualties?' If you think the answer is to ""Go in there with you guns blazing and kill everyone' you are very wrong. The weapons in this game are very realistic. This is one of my favourite features of Arma 2. They are not overpowered, like the three round burst pistol in Black Ops 2 that kills in six shots. My favourite part about the weapons in this game is that they kill in one shot to the head. (Something Call of Duty never had.) a shot to the head with ANY gun in this game is an instant kill.The NPcs in this game are very intelligent, and WILL kill you. In the deathmatch mode, you can expect to get 2-4 kills in one life. If you are a veteran at this game, then this number varies.The strategy and communication within a team/squad is overwhelming. Especially in the game mode 'Super Powers.' (my favourite) where you need to capture camps all across the map, which is HUGE.Lastly, the vehicles. Arma 2 offers a very very life-like driving and flying experience. The cars are about what you expect, as well as the boats, but the planes and helicopters are so realistic, and the controlls are pretty hard to grasp.Another cool feature of Arma 2 is the editor. You can create your own custom missions with your own custom goals. You can export them to your multiplayer missions and play them with your friends!What I love most about this game is the skill involved. it is a game centered around tactical planning and life-like warfare. If you want to be entertained for hours and hours, and want to have a different experience from your typical modern day shooter, this game is for you.			",140,31,5,27,10,1,9

												The United States Army (USA) is the main branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for land-based military operations. It is the largest and oldest established branch of the U.S. military, and is one of seven U.S. uniformed services. The modern army has its roots in the Continental Army which was formed on 14 June 1775, to meet the demands of the American Revolutionary War before the establishment of the United States. The Congress of the Confederation officially created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 after the end of the Revolutionary War to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The army considers itself to be descended from the Continental Army and thus dates its inception from the origins of that force.The primary mission of the army is ""to fight and win our Nation’s wars by providing prompt, sustained land dominance across the full range of military operations and spectrum of conflict in support of combatant commanders.""The army is a military service within the Department of the Army, one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense. The army is headed by the Secretary of the Army, and the top military officer in the department is the Chief of Staff of the Army. The highest ranking army officer is currently the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. During fiscal year 2011, the Regular Army reported a strength of 546,057 soldiers; the Army National Guard (ARNG) reported 358,078 and the United States Army Reserve (USAR) reported 201,166 putting the combined component strength total at 1,105,301 soldiers.The Continental Army was created on 14 June 1775 by the Continental Congress as a unified army for the colonies to fight Great Britain, with George Washington appointed as its commander.[4] The army was initially led by men who had served in the British Army or colonial militias and who brought much of British military heritage with them. As the Revolutionary War progressed, French aid, resources, and military thinking influenced the new army. A number of European soldiers came on their own to help, such as Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, who taught the army Prussian tactics and organizational skills.The army fought numerous pitched battles and in the South 1780–81 sometimes used the Fabian strategy and hit-and-run tactics, hitting where the enemy was weakest, to wear down the British forces. Washington led victories against the British at Trenton and Princeton, but lost a series of battles around New York City in 1776 and Philadelphia in 1777. With a decisive victory at Yorktown, and the help of the French, the Continental Army prevailed against the British.After the war, though, the Continental Army was quickly given land certificates and disbanded in a reflection of the republican distrust of standing armies. State militias became the new nation's sole ground army, with the exception of a regiment to guard the Western Frontier and one battery of artillery guarding West Point's arsenal. However, because of continuing conflict with Native Americans, it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The Regular Army was at first very small, and after General St. Clair's defeat at the Battle of the Wabash, the Regular Army was reorganized as the Legion of the United States, which was established in 1791 and renamed the ""United States Army"" in 1796.General Andrew Jackson stands on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attacking Highlanders during the defense of New Orleans, the final major battle of the War of 1812The War of 1812, the second and last American war against Britain, was less successful than the Revolution had been. Despite the Burning of York and Death of Tecumseh which caused his Indian confederacy to collapse, an invasion of Canada failed, and U.S. troops were unable to stop the British from burning the new capital of Washington, D.C.. However, the Regular Army, under Generals Alexander Macomb and Samuel Smith, proved they were professional and capable of defeating the British army during the invasions of Plattsburgh and Baltimore, and the relatively small US Navy, often attached with Marines, earned most of the victory against the Royal Navy at sea. Two weeks after a treaty was signed, Andrew Jackson defeated the British in the Battle of New Orleans and became a national hero. Per the treaty both sides returned to the status quo with no victor.The army's major campaign against the Indians was fought in Florida against Seminoles. It took long wars (1818–1858) to finally defeat the Seminoles and move them to Oklahoma. The usual strategy in Indian wars was to seize control of the Indians winter food supply, but that was no use in Florida where there was no winter. The second strategy was to form alliances with other Indian tribes, but that too is no use because the Seminoles had destroyed all the other Indians when they entered Florida in the late eighteenth century.The U.S. Army fought and won the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), which was a defining event for both countries. The U.S. victory resulted in acquisition of territory that eventually became all or parts of the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and New Mexico.The Civil War was the most costly war for the U.S. in terms of casualties. After most states in the South seceded to form the Confederate States of America, CSA troops opened fire on the Union-held Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, starting the war. Forces loyal to the United States were commonly called the Union Army during that war.For the first two years Confederate forces solidly defeated the U.S. Army, with a few exceptions.[ The Confederates had the advantage of defending a very large country in an area where disease caused twice as many deaths as combat. The Union pursued a strategy of seizing the coastline, blockading the ports, and taking control of the river systems. By 1863 the Confederacy was being strangled. Its eastern armies did very well in combat, but the western armies were defeated one after another until New Orleans was lost in 1862 along with the Tennessee River, the Mississippi River was lost in 1863, and Atlanta fell in 1864.[13] Grant took command of Union forces in 1864 and after a series of battles with very heavy casualties, he had Lee under siege in Richmond. Lee lost his Confederate capital in April 1865 and was captured at Appomatox Courthouse; the other Confederate armies quickly surrendered.The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 soldiers. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and 18% in the South.Following the Civil War, the U.S. Army fought a long battle with several western tribes of Native AmericansBy the 1890s the U.S. saw itself as a potential international player. U.S. victories in the Spanish–American War and the controversial and less well known Philippine–American War, as well as U.S. intervention in Latin America and the Boxer Rebellion, gained America more land and power.Starting in 1910, the army began acquiring fixed-wing aircraft.[15] In 1910, Mexico was having a civil war, peasant rebels fighting government soldiers. The army was deployed to American towns near the border to ensure safety to lives and property. In 1916, Pancho Villa, a major rebel leader, attacked Columbus, New Mexico, prompting a U.S. intervention in Mexico until 7 February 1917. They fought the rebels and the Mexican federal troops until 1918. The United States joined World War I in 1917 on the side of Britain, France, Russia, Italy and other allies. U.S. troops were sent to the front and were involved in the push that finally broke through the German lines. Have fun killing for the land of murica			",80,8,1,12,2,1,13

												Oh ho ho this game makes me smile whenever I hear about it. Its an AWESOME game (despite some flaws with player controls) nonetheless in the long run. The Arma 2 campaign isnt too amazing, but thats just because it's a open world military simulator trying to tell a linear story. The editor and the multiplayer is where this game really becomes badass, the editor is really a game editor and once you learn some basic scripts for it, then you can litterally become god with it. The multiplayer lets you release your awesome missions into the world, but you have to play it to get what I mean! BUY IT! SOOOOOOOOOOO MANY PERKS!			",71,3,1,5,4,1,22

												As long as you have a computer that can support it, then it's a awesome game. The action itself, where you go on and try to complete missions, takes some getting used to, and you'll often die for your first couple tries. But if you beat, or quit the missions, there's a editor just around the corner. Create your own missions, test out scenarios, or just have fun. A favorite of mine is to spawn in 30 or so jets flying above me all at once, watch them fight for airspace and crash into nearby buildings and trees. Would recommend to anyone with a computer that can handle it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												fun game but not for everyone. to everyone that says the controls are complicated, that is the reason for the bootcamp levels. The game teaches its controls well and covers everything from infantry,building,commanding squads,commanding armies,vehicles like cars trucks helicopters and planes. It has a long campaign that is very good. It has mods to make it whatever you want it to be, most  of which are free. The online is also well protected and fun. But, this IS a simulator not Call of Duty. You die in one to three shots and MUST be patient. But I give all the armas a 10/10. Very fun games.			",23,2,0,1,6,0,2

												I love this game. If you can find a good server, the action never stops or if you prefer you can do the real tactical stuff, that's one of the main reasons I like it. It's a mix between both. I would play it becasuse it's still going strong even with arma 3 being out. It might be a little frustrating when you first get the game but eventually you'll see how great and fun it is, especially with friends ",41,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Not quite as difficult of play control as I expected, once you get the hang of it -it's second nature...great graphics, but read up on tweaking it a bit for much better FPS/performance.  Pretty decent NPC A.I.! they are challenging! Supports TRACK IR5, which is very cool to use. no equal for amount of weapons, vehicles and realism.(though heli's fly like bricks)  I've played a lot of shooters, and have real life military knowledge, and this game is the closest i've yet played to recreating actual missions. so pretty fun stuff. The missions are varied and well designed, some are buggers though, keep trying different approaches! With all the add-on's already offered, you could play this guy until the next version...easily 3-5 years.  Have fun!			",89,13,3,12,15,2,16

												If you want a game all about strats and teamwork. This is it. You command your squad to assist you through battles and conquer the various missions and DLC this game has to play. This graphics are good for its time. And it rt-uns perfectly if you have the right stats. The online multiplayer can be slow depending on what type of server you're playing on. But once you get the hang of the complex and somewhat annoying controls the game actually turns out to be extremely fun and interesting.			",350,61,6,39,31,5,60

												If you like anything to do with war wether its tanks, guns, armor, helicopters, this game has every thing you could imagine about war. I found this game hard to get used to because of the complex contols but once mastered is loads of fun.(I would not recomend this title to people who dont have a beefed up pc because Arma is massive and its no fun if its laggy, so dont spend all that money if you can run somthing like TF2 very well.) My recommendations for the bundle of arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrow head is that its worth the money because you can install Dayz onto it for free which is a huge must have in the pc gaming world. Im not sure what the exact size of arma 2, arma 2 operation arrow head, Dayz together but i highly recommend it.			",88,3,0,6,5,0,2

												This is one of the best military shooters I have played. It is different from your average fps, you have to be tactical, move carefully and fire accurately. There are plenty of missions, some are a little slow if you enjoy tons of action though. Multiplayer is great when using mods like DayZ and Wasteland, I haven't played any of the traditional multiplayer, but DayZ has lots and lots of different variations to play with.			",53,5,1,4,5,0,1

												As long as you have a computer that can support it, then it's a awesome game. The action itself, where you go on and try to complete missions, takes some getting used to, and you'll often die for your first couple tries. But if you beat, or quit the missions, there's a editor just around the corner. Create your own missions, test out scenarios, or just have fun. A favorite of mine is to spawn in 30 or so jets flying above me all at once, watch them fight for airspace and crash into nearby buildings and trees. Would recommend to anyone with a computer that can handle it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Realistic war game simulation, enough said. If you are shot, you WILL die. If you are being healed it WILL take forever. If you shoot a gun it WILL make a sound. Games like Battlefield or Call of Duty simply can't compare to this game when it comes to realism. Sadly, if your the type of person that likes a fast paced game, then Arma II, and REAL LIFE, are not going to be your cup of tea. Look elsewere. However, Slight bonus. If you buy Combined Operations, you get access to a free Mod known as DayZ. This is a Realistic zombie survival simulation. Its very fun and adrenaline pumping at times, even more so with friends or Team Speak. However, patience is a virtue NEEDED in this game. You WILL die. You WILL lose all your gear. You WILL be robbed by other players and killed. And you WILL break your legs, Bleed out, run out of ammo, etc. etc. etc. Hope you enjoy. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good enough game in its own right, this newly-discovered gem also opens the door to play DayZ, a brilliant little zombie survival mod.  Strangely enough, the game is nearing 3 years old, but can still amaze with snazzy lighting effects and ridiculous draw distances.  There's no denying it - for how cheap it is now packaged with Operation Arrowhead, and the countless hours you spend surviving in DayZ, the bang for buck ratio here is astronomical.  So go get it!

												Alright, where do I start?Well, Arma 2 features good graphics and unforgettable gameplay, tactical planning is required for this game. If you are a former Call of duty addict, this game is not for you. ;PTo play this game, you need to think 'now if there is a tank there, and artillary there, how can I get my men to capture that camp with the least possible casualties?' If you think the answer is to ""Go in there with you guns blazing and kill everyone' you are very wrong. The weapons in this game are very realistic. This is one of my favourite features of Arma 2. They are not overpowered, like the three round burst pistol in Black Ops 2 that kills in six shots. My favourite part about the weapons in this game is that they kill in one shot to the head. (Something Call of Duty never had.) a shot to the head with ANY gun in this game is an instant kill.The NPcs in this game are very intelligent, and WILL kill you. In the deathmatch mode, you can expect to get 2-4 kills in one life. If you are a veteran at this game, then this number varies.The strategy and communication within a team/squad is overwhelming. Especially in the game mode 'Super Powers.' (my favourite) where you need to capture camps all across the map, which is HUGE.Lastly, the vehicles. Arma 2 offers a very very life-like driving and flying experience. The cars are about what you expect, as well as the boats, but the planes and helicopters are so realistic, and the controlls are pretty hard to grasp.Another cool feature of Arma 2 is the editor. You can create your own custom missions with your own custom goals. You can export them to your multiplayer missions and play them with your friends!What I love most about this game is the skill involved. it is a game centered around tactical planning and life-like warfare. If you want to be entertained for hours and hours, and want to have a different experience from your typical modern day shooter, this game is for you.			",140,31,5,27,10,1,9

												there was ARMA, than there was ARMA 2...all the same mechanics are in each arma (kill the enemy, keep the world safe and so on). What i just mentioned does not mean its boring, all ARMAs are rather awesome and great to play but i can not forget to mention this is a SIMULATOR GAME, dont act like a childish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a ♥♥♥♥♥ in here like you do in other games, that just gets you kicked and banned, extending this note, its required you to do teamwork and spec op tactics to survive (without getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from dieing and respawning)in the end, i highly recommend this. also its standalone DLC or game called Operation Arrowhead, and the upcoming ARMA3			",125,0,3,2,5,0,12

												6/10     Arma ll is not your average war game like battlefield or call of duty, this is a simulator that provides very slowed paced combat and well thought out battle tatics. This game is not for the average joe and I feel it only attracts a small audience of players who have two hours on there hand to go through a single match, this game does a great job besides the lack of detail and minor bugs repersenting a war sim and if you are looking for the most realistic war simulator out there, this is it so far.

												     What can i Say? ARMA 2 is an actual tactical shooter. It is a game that requires tactical planning, and for you to rely on your teammates. this is a far cry from call of duty and battlefield. Its action is very slow-paced, and thats how some people like it. There is a wide variety of vehicles and weapons that are based on the real military equipment.      I only really played the multiplayer, which has a cheat protection system, so you dont have to worry about hackers. On multiplayer, theres a lot types of servers. Theres ones with zombies, lofe simulators, and good old fashion team vs AI matches. i give the Multiplayer of ARMA 2 a 10/10. Ill maybe make another review of the Single player experience.

												I originally got this game, like a lot of people, for the DayZ Mod. It's controls are clunky and frustrating at first, but if you give it time and learn the controls (they are mappable, I'd be furious if they weren't.) it is a fantastic Military Sim. There are way more mods and game modes other than just DayZ, too. MSO, Island Life, etc. are all excellent game modes to try, too. The graphics are a little dated, but it's a few years old now. If Graphics are your thing, ARMA 3 is the obvious alternative. 10/10.			",161,13,5,11,20,2,18

There's a lot of unpolished stuff going on throughout the game but it's an overall gem under the rough. I do hope that ARMA III has a 'realstic mode' for the vehicles and air crafts.

												If you want an FPS where you can do all your nice trickshots and play the game fast and call of duty style then i would reccommend that you stay as far as ♥♥♥♥ing possible away from arma 2. in my oppinion this isn't a bad thing, in fact i think it is an AMAZING thing because i am absolutely sick of hearing screaming 3 year olds from call of duty whining and calling people noobsnow then, on to the game itself, I admit Arma 2 is a bit rough around the edges, plenty of glitches and not so high quality physics but overall I LOVE this game,the countless number of scenarios you can find on multiplayer ( my personal favorite being Chernarus life ) is amazing, you can go from flying in with your assault team to liberate a town from the Pro-russian forces in chernarus, to being a cop patroling the city of chernogorsk. The variety of weapons is amazing, most of which are about as satisfing to fire as it can be in a video game. Overall this game is amazing, although a little bit rough around the edges I would highly reccomend it9/10 stars			",69,1,0,9,10,0,25

												---Pre- report--- Arma 2This game is not for the faint of heart it takes work and motivation to push through and improve.This is NOT a COD or Battlefield game you go down in three shots from some of the weakest guns in the game. But before you push this off as a horrible game, it is one of a kind and worth the buy. If not for the game itself but for the dayz mod that can be applied to it. The physics engine and shooting also make this game one of the most detailed FPS games I have ever seen. I do how ever if you are intrigued recommend using a gamepad for it, the controls are often clunky and hard to use for most on the keyboard.Personal rating:7/10--- only because I’m not a hardcore FPS person, your view may differ from mine.Story mode: Lets just say story mode is not the strongest suit to this game, sounding and looking a lot like Call of duty’s story, for me it was a bit too repetitive. I was able to tell what happened next.Story score: 2/5Gameplay/Engine: One of the fine points to this game it has a well tested a proven engine that can dictate and allow for airflow wind velocity and then apply them to your weapons making distance from your target count no matter what. winds also push your weapons off course making it necessary for you to learn how to adapt. This all put to gether with great detail in the environment allows for fun and non repetitive gameplay.Gameplay/engine score: 4.5/5Graphics: This game may be 4 years old but it still has something to show off. The graphics are still pushing and can look amazing on full settings to this day.Graphics score: 4/5Overall rating: 10.5/15**Recommend you get all DLC if looking to buy** ",213,34,4,17,18,2,19

												I originally got this game, like a lot of people, for the DayZ Mod. It's controls are clunky and frustrating at first, but if you give it time and learn the controls (they are mappable, I'd be furious if they weren't.) it is a fantastic Military Sim. There are way more mods and game modes other than just DayZ, too. MSO, Island Life, etc. are all excellent game modes to try, too. The graphics are a little dated, but it's a few years old now. If Graphics are your thing, ARMA 3 is the obvious alternative. 10/10.			",161,13,5,11,20,2,18

But, thats not all it is, many custom missions/mods have been made that make ArmA a flight sim, a game of Cops n' Crooks, a hunting game, or even a sort of 'Game of Life' type of mission. DayZ tops all of this off. Sure it can be somewhat glitched up at times, but it can also be a LOT of fun. (DayZ REQUIRES both ArmA II AND ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead so just buy Combined Operations and you get both!) The campaign is also loads of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's controls are clunky and frustrating at first, but if you give it time and learn the controls (they are mappable, I'd be furious if they weren't.) it is a fantastic Military Sim. There are way more mods and game modes other than just DayZ, too. MSO, Island Life, etc. are all excellent game modes to try, too. The graphics are a little dated, but it's a few years old now. If Graphics are your thing, ARMA 3 is the obvious alternative. 10/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good enough game in its own right, this newly-discovered gem also opens the door to play DayZ, a brilliant little zombie survival mod.  Strangely enough, the game is nearing 3 years old, but can still amaze with snazzy lighting effects and ridiculous draw distances.  There's no denying it - for how cheap it is now packaged with Operation Arrowhead, and the countless hours you spend surviving in DayZ, the bang for buck ratio here is astronomical.  So go get it!

New things I haven't seen: Ability to switch between 1st and 3rd person (actually useful), bullet physics in every gun (and they change between guns too), injury affects aiming accuracy and stance (I got shot in the legs, lost the ability to walk...), realistic vehicles (tank can't be operated by just one person, realistic helicopter physics, can land all flying vehicles...etc.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6/10     Arma ll is not your average war game like battlefield or call of duty, this is a simulator that provides very slowed paced combat and well thought out battle tatics. This game is not for the average joe and I feel it only attracts a small audience of players who have two hours on there hand to go through a single match, this game does a great job besides the lack of detail and minor bugs repersenting a war sim and if you are looking for the most realistic war simulator out there, this is it so far.

												As long as you have a computer that can support it, then it's a awesome game. The action itself, where you go on and try to complete missions, takes some getting used to, and you'll often die for your first couple tries. But if you beat, or quit the missions, there's a editor just around the corner. Create your own missions, test out scenarios, or just have fun. A favorite of mine is to spawn in 30 or so jets flying above me all at once, watch them fight for airspace and crash into nearby buildings and trees. Would recommend to anyone with a computer that can handle it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												90% of people who buy Arma 2 buy it to play DayZ and never actually get into the core game. Honestly, it is awesome. While I personally don't enjoy the campaign and pre-made missions, I absolutely love the mission editor. It is the coolest thing; it basically gives you the ability to construct small battles all-the-way-to large wars. I have played it for hours, creating missions and stories to my liking. If want a game that is largely customizable, I highly recommend Arma 2... also, DayZ is pretty awesome (standalone is out, get it if you haven't).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great army simulator that is very expansive with official content and mods. Great to play for hours on ends with friends or complete strangers. Slightly clunky mechanics, makes up for it in the amount of things that you can do with the game though. -TurdSnack 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best military shooters I have played. It is different from your average fps, you have to be tactical, move carefully and fire accurately. There are plenty of missions, some are a little slow if you enjoy tons of action though. Multiplayer is great when using mods like DayZ and Wasteland, I haven't played any of the traditional multiplayer, but DayZ has lots and lots of different variations to play with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good sim, my only problem is this: Recommended: OS: Windows XP or Windows Vista Processor: Quad Core CPU or fast Dual Core CPU (Intel Core 2.8 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 4400+ or faster) Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: Fast GPU (Nvidia Geforce 8800GT or ATI Radeon 4850 or faster) with Shader Model 3 and 512 or more MB VRAM Hard Drive: 10 GB free HDD space I beast that recommendation atleast 200 times over. And I still lag like hell, they could do well with some optimization.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jesus Christ, the 3D game engine that this game runs on is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game is fun and all, but the lack of hardware utilization is a ♥♥♥♥ing sin! My rig can play bf4 1080p maxed settings at a constant 60fps, and this game can barely pull a constant 40fps. Sometimes switching between menu's freezes the game. Like when I switch from the main menu and into the multiplayer menu (vice versa).I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THE GAME ENGINE THAT THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥IS RUNNING ON!
