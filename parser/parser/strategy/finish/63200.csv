												Monday Night Combat had a nice aesthetic that captured the feel of a sports show, with an intriguingly unnerving game world, and interesting if somewhat flawed gameplay that was at least worth a look.Too bad there is exactly one (1) dedicated server still running.This game was basically a third-person shooter/MOBA hybrid with tower defense elements. (The free-to-play, pay-to-win sequel Super Monday Night Combat - which is currently only slightly less abandoned and which suffered from technical issues - was even more MOBA-like.)Players chose from one of six classes that each played different roles, and money collected on the battlefield or earned from kills could be used to build turrets and upgrade player abilities. The range of mechanics available to the player was a bit confusing for newcomers even if less complex than any actual MOBA, especially when veteran TPS/MOBA players found the game more intuitive.The two main modes were Blitz, which saw you and your team defending your Moneyball against hordes of robots, and Crossfire, which pitted your team against another team in a 6v6 game to destroy the other team's Moneyball with the help of allied robots; more or less DotA as a shooter.The tutorial was basic: it only taught the basics of gameplay and how to play one class. Players had to consult more in-depth guides in order to effectively learn about the game.MNC's world was briefly glimpsed yet revealing: it painted a picture of a totalitarian, consumerist society akin to the Roman Empire that hinted at darker aspects of our own world, where the downtrodden lower classes watched Monday Night Combat for cheap thrills.The game's cartoony graphics weren't so stellar even when maxed out, but they served their purpose, and you wouldn't really have played this for the graphics anyway. Player customization was pretty good though, letting players choose outfits for the classes and pick a title to display gained from completing in-game achievements, such as killing a certain number of enemies. And the characters - the Pros - had some nice diversity going on: a Hawaiian, an African-American, and a woman comprised three of the six characters.Overall, despite some flaws, the game was fun enough to earn a decently sized playerbase back in the day.Okay, you're probably curious about my use of past tense, not to mention my implication that the game is dead. Well...Official servers were shut down in 2012. The playerbase relies on two Steam groups to gather players for matches either on the lone public server or temporary private ones, and you can bet that most of their small number are skilled enough to utterly stomp newer players.There's single-player Blitz available, but there is no single-player Crossfire with AI players, which means that the Crossfire-related achievements are pretty much extremely difficult to get - and are practically no longer attainable without farming. And that's terrible.So what happened to Monday Night Combat?Lack of support is the most obvious problem. Microsoft wouldn't let developers Uber Entertainment update the 360 version, and they ran out of money to keep updating the PC version. The small team of devs had to jump through a lot of hoops just to get the game released. This led to disengagement from the community and an inability to address their concerns.Polygon ran an article[www.polygon.com] that illustrated these problems; it's worth reading if you're curious.Tying into the inability to be engaged with and work on the game, MNC's balance wasn't all that good either from what I can tell. Skilled Snipers and Assaults were difficult to counter. Cheesy tactics abounded, such as excessive use of ricocheting weapons and sniping turrets from outside their range rendering them somewhat ineffective for point defense.The ability for players to supercharge, and the use of what was basically a doomsday weapon located in the center of every arena, meant a losing team could effectively blunt the winning team's progress if they gained the upper hand. Hackers were a problem, the lack of community development tools/an SDK was a different problem; Tanks, Gunners and grapples were borderline overpowered off the bat, while the Assassin was apparently underpowered.The only way you can really play this game now is to gather a group of friends and host your own server. I suppose that since this game originally came out in 2010, it could only have lasted for so long. It's a shame the devs didn't include player AI for Crossfire mode - even with its flaws, that's the one thing that would have ultimately saved this game from its ignoble death.At least Uber Entertainment survived, and would go on to create large-scale RTS Planetary Annihilation - another flawed yet interesting game.The little time I spent with Monday Night Combat was pretty fun, and it certainly had potential. The main menu song was pretty good, at any rate. But I really cannot recommend it.Oh, well. The TF2 promo items were nice.			",195,39,3,14,32,1,35

												Do NOT buy this game nor its free pay-to-play counterpart, Super Monday Night Combat. The developer, Uber Entertainment, has abandoned support for this game for more than a year; not officially, mind you, but dead silence on anything from the company on the MNC/SMNC front as they are concentrating support on another game of theirs.While this is a fun, balanced 3rd person MOBA, mixing Team Fortress 2 and DOTA, as well as being one of the few games that is not only ACTUALLY hilarious, unlike other games where the jokes are funny once and never again, this has such an extensive library of well-written lines, it is sad that the developer decided to sabotage the game for a quick buck via the F2P & in-game store model. Save your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simple fast paced team based shooter with moba like elements, pick from one of 6 classes each with their own unique skills and abillities. All classes have their strengths and weaknesses each with their own personality. Monday Night Combat is my favourite game on steam and always will be! Unfortunately the games playerbase is very limited, but with the help of the MNC community games are organised regularly. So don't threat too much about never being able to play. The commentator of the game spews out hilarious dialogue about your situation and the teams performance, the game even has a mascot that appears on the field that you can shoot for money and prizes!Join the ""hotshotsforever"" group on steam to inform you of organised events.Did I mention MNC is the most lethal sport of the future? ;)Hiyo! 10/10! Oh!... And theres bacon!			",403,81,13,44,14,5,30

 There is a warning at the bottom of this review, I reccomend you read it after the rest of the review before purchasing.tl;dr: Amazing, funny, fun team based third person shooter with minor MOBA elements that's saddly very, very dead currently. If you have friends and they're all willing, it's a fantastic game though.I'll say this now, the original Monday Night Combat is one of my favorite games of all time.It's a class based, PVP/PVE, team centric third person shooter set in a hilariously dark (but never seen) dystopian future where you compete as a group of clones fighting in a lethal sport in specially made and company branded arenas. Got all that? Oh and there's also upgrading skills, bacon, a mascot you shoot to get money, dual miniguns, half of the classes have jetpacks, light tower defense mechanics, taunting is a way you earn money AND a sexy mascot who's also the one providing you turrets?There's light twinges of MOBAs in Monday Night Combat, but if that makes you cringe from past experiences with MOBAs, set it aside because everything is easy enough to understand and nowhere near as punishing as your typical MOBA.The game plays like this: There are two teams, with ""bases"" on each side of the symmetrical map, each base has several spots where you can place turrets and a ""money ball"" to defend with its own shield which has to be destroyed for the other team to win. Each base also spawns bots (which can be killed to get cash)Act, which meet at the middle of the map and clash, but without players helping them out, they won't get far. The trick is that each money ball has a shield, one that can only be broken if a friendly bot reaches the enemy money ball. There's also the hilarious narrator who gives details about the setting and comments on how well you are playing. He doesn't really ever get old.There's also a lot more I could talk about, like custom boost loadouts to be unlocked, each class has its own spawn-able bot type, chickey cantor... I could go on forever but I'll try to make this review short-er.The good: It's funny, it's REALLY fun to play, it has a fantastic visual style, and the balancing is very good for the most part. It's just... really, really good. Also Chickey Cantor... gotta add at least a whole point on the review score for having a giant robotic chicken.The bad: (Mostly nitpicks) Parts of it haven't aged so well, such as parts of the gunplay. The balance isn't perfect as that a few clases in the right hands can almost steamroll such as The Support and The Sniper. Losing isn't very fun, and sometimes you can get stuck in a losing game without much way of getting back up due to some bad investments. It's overall a fantastic game.HOWEVER, WARNINGHere's where the sad part of the review comes in... right now the multiplayer community is, except for a few groups who meet occasionally, pretty much dead. If you're wondering about my hours played being something like 1.6 or 1.9, it's because most of this game I played on the Xbox LIVE version, which had fewer maps and costumes but was still the same damn game you can buy here, and feels great with and without a controller. There's also Super Monday Night Combat, the Free 2 play ""sequel"" is available, which more or less dumbed down the importance of the shooty bits and made it feel a bit more like a typical MOBA, but also added a whole new roster of characters and another announcer that makes it twice as funny as the original MNC. It's also dead, but you can unlock items for TF2 and vice-versa. As for this game... most of what you can do now is join groups like  Hotshots Forever . Sad to see such a good game go.

												This game was amazing! Back when it had players, at least. Sadly, the already-struggling game was killed when Uber decided to release Super Monday Night Combat, which was then killed off as well.I wish this game were still alive. If it were, there'd be reason to play it. There's none, now.EDIT: I should probably add this to the review: There is still a group on steam that plays the game, but don't expect to see more than one server with people on it -ever- (and I love this group for that, I missed this game so badly), and don't expect to see even that 80% of the time.

												This game is dead, with only one server active that is empty. That being said, if you buy this game during the sale and persuade a few friends to buy it too, you could have a bit of fun with this game. During its peak, this game was a very popular and fun game however I didn't play the MNC series in it's prime so I never truly got to learn this game or SMNC, and am stuck with the blitz mode on this game. The Blitz mode, like SMNC can be played solo though at least, and I prefer the Blitz mode on this version as it feels way more relaxed and is a nice way to chillax and get rid of stress.In conclusion, if you are looking for a multiplayer game to drop in and drop out of if you have no friends to play it with, then this game is not for you. However, when the game is on sale and your friends are willing to buy it to play with you, i'd say it is still worth the sale price despite being completely dead. Also the Blitz mode was worth the sale price in my opinion.			",241,29,6,6,11,5,12

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Monday Night Combat is a multiplayer shooter game that incorporates shooter mechanics, tactical tower defense mechanics, and fun mechanics into one package. So did this bizarre mix of mechanics work to the game's benefit or did it just end up being too much for one little game to take in.Monday Night Combat may be a small game, but it was able to take in a deep breath and work the air through its system smoothly allowing for an entirely new take on multiplayer shooters.Overall: Monday Night Combat is an enjoyable and unique multiplayer shooter that incorporates a whole lot of different mechanics into a little game. The end result is an engrossing and highly addictive experience that makes it all the worthwhile to explore the depths of indie multiplayer games.			",1961,757,75,172,243,17,314

												Super Monday Night combat replaced this, basicaly going from traditional development to wacky Freemium buy our♥♥♥♥♥♥frenzy.Uber's reluctance to just say they lied about ever doing a map maker for the community was the final nail in its coffin. Don't buy it. Don't touch their other one either unless you want to waste time in a largely dead game, because surprise, they couldn't manage this one, they definately couldn't handle the Dota like.If this was on sale for a dollar, I'd light that dollar on fire and get more enjoyment then out of this dead neglected game.Thanks Uber, You made a fun game, killed it, replaced it with something similar but more money grubbing, and killed that too.If you are going to make something for PC, make it for PC, don't pander and try to maximize profits under the guise of understanding PC players.

												This game is a ton of fun.It's set in a gameshow in the future where you play as a contestent (one of 6 classes --> Sniper, Support, Tank, Gunner, Assault, Assassin).  There are 2 modes crossfire (PvP) and Blitz (Co-op).  Crossfire is the mode that I play the most.  Basically it's a 6 on 6 arena where your goal is to get your team's bots past the enemy's turrets in order to take down their moneyball.  Once the moneyball's shields are down, you can attack it.  Lots of strategy is involved though due to the varying skills that each of the classes come armed with.  You'll need to take out enemy players, enemy bots and enemy turrets before you can get your bots in.  There are environmental hazards you can use to your advantage, you can upgrade yourself in-game, you can buy/upgrade turrets, and you can even purchase additional bots to come help you out.I highly recommend this game, but do be forewarned that the player-base is currently pretty small.10/10			",417,68,14,32,21,0,41

												This game had a lot of potential. It was fun during the summer event for a few days when there were tons of players of all skill levels. I really enjoyed it at first.Not many maps or modes. Hardly any players on now. If you do find a populous server, chances are, you'll be playing against veteran players. I hope you enjoy players constantly giving themself full HP or freezing you to no end or being showered with explosives spam. The assassins are pretty easy to take care of, though. I'm just a touch from level 10, so maybe I haven't fully experienced what the game has to offer. With the way things are, I've lost all interest in doing so.I'm sure the game is very rewarding for those who've spent countless hours mastering the game with its miniscule amount of maps and modes.

												This game is AMAZING.I originally purchased it on Xbox 360 back in 2010 after I fell in love playing the trial version. (This was back when people actually played the game, and the servers weren't totally dead.) I think that was when the MOBA craze was just taking off, but this did something original with the formula that I hadn't seen anywhere before... It's a class-based shooter like TF2 but the game plays like League of Legends -- you protect your home base's ""crystal"" from the opposing team's minions (all different kinds of robots, in this case). What makes this formula even more interesting is that your ""towers"" (turrets) are selected and upgraded by YOU and your team using the ""gold"" you get from killing the enemy team and their minions. And to top this all off, it has a crazy, silly, cartoony atmosphere and art style, and it acts like it's a reality game show/sport (hence the title), complete with a witty announcer.I picked up a 4-pack for super cheap a few months ago to share with friends, but... Sadly, since no one really plays it anymore, all you're really left with is the 1-4 player ""tower defense"" co-op mode -- you choose your turrets to defend against waves of the different kinds of robots and defend your crystal.Eventually, they released a sequel in 2012 (Super MNC), but it was a free-to-play, microtransaction mess only available on PC. It was awkward and boring with none of the charm of the original (read: hat simulator), and I don't think anyone plays that anymore either.Really, MNC is the predecessor to the likes of Smite, Minimum, and Orcs Must Die: Unchained... If you can pick this game up for a buck or two, maybe you could get some friends together to play it, even if it's just the co-op mode. Sure, you didn't get to play it in its heyday, but you still get to play something different.			",499,106,7,26,19,4,41

												This game is so much fun. Back when it was released on Xbox 360 Arcade, so many people jumped into this game and it was a HUGE success. Sadly, Uber Ent went and forgot about the Xbox 360 community and gave more attention to the PC version. They gave us only the Spunky Cola special DLC but never gave us the Uncle Tully's map and other DLCs they said we'd get. Eventually, they abandoned MNC on both sides, PC and Xbox and decided to make Super MNC. Community responded by not supporting Super MNC like they were hoping us to. Instead we enjoyed MNC for a much as would could until it slowly withered away.Currently, this game is dead. The game itself is fun if people decide to jump in again and play. If Uber Ent would just drop the price of $5 and make it Free to play and just add some skins to customize your appearance WHICH DOES NOT ADD ANY STATS BOOSTS AND IS SOLELY FOR COSMETIC PURPOSES! Then they can get some money and MAYBE the community will slowly begin to revive itself. If you and some friends would like to play this game together and against each other for fun and laughs, go for it. They do have a co-op mode called Blitz. Blitz is pretty much a survival mode where you survive wave after wave of bots and you need to protect the Money Ball from getting destroyed. Blitz can be played offline. Crossfire is the multiplayer mode, it can be played offline but splitscreen, no AIs are allowed in this game for either game mode.Hope this information helps anyone decide whether they want to spend money and try the game with friends, or wait until if it ever goes Free to Play.PS: I barely have hours on here because I mainly played back on Xbox 360 back in it's glory days.

												A bit of a let down, personally. I heard great things about the cool, DOTA inspired modes, but that stuff doesn't seem to really have much effect on the actual game. The action isn't as tight as TF2, and the turrets just seem sort of useless. Not a horrible game, but I wouldn't pay $15 bucks for it if I hadn't already. Might be worth it when it's on sale for $5.			",489,76,6,82,66,5,102

												I'm afraid I can't recommend this game any more. Not because it's bad; it's an amazingly fun multiplayer game that's a sort of hybrid of the best aspects of MOBA and shooter. It's just that nobody plays it any more; the entire remaining active community has congregated to 2 groups of fewer than 300 members, neither of has posted much of anything within the last three months as of this edit. You may be able to have fun with this game's sequel, Super Monday Night Combat, but that game's much more of a MOBA than this one was.Original review below.What is it? Not TF2!What's it like? TF2!No hats or free-to-play. There's a title system but it hasn't affected anything so far as far as I can tell.			",901,326,38,153,101,11,193

												Seriously, what a waste of 15 dollars. Next to no one plays this online and without bot support for Crossfire matchs you're stuck with a crappy tower defense mode to play offline. The gameplay is only fun when you are matched up with players of similar skill and when the game isn't lagging hella bad. Sadly, the only people who still play this trash are 200x your level, so don't expect to win often.			",124,11,1,12,5,1,5

												I bought this game for about 10 bucks (one copy for a friend of mine, one for me), expecting it to be a great co-op and PvP game, after reading the glowing reviews and the way it is advertised on Steam.What can i say? Don't bother. There's a good game in there but you can hardly play it. The first thing i noticed were input and settings related bugs. Then crashes. But worst of all, no servers and the inability to actually create a co-op room and invite you friends (remember, it was advertised to have this feature).If you're lucky, you may still find a dedicated server, which most likely will be empty. If you create your own lobby, you will be unable to invite your friends and your friends won't be able to see it in the server browser (we tried it, multiple times and with multiple settings/solutions).The only way to play this online, is to get into one of the two empty servers i have found and let your friend join them too. The downside is, you can't select the game mode or map and you most likely end up in opposing teams (1vs1 basically).It's a shame, really, because the game itself promoses to be fun. I don't care if this was released on 2011. It's still sold and advertised on steam and i expect the advertised features to work. It may be ""just"" 10 bucks, but i want it back anyway.This game is the straw that broke the camel's back and i will refrain from buying anything on steam for a while.			",94,4,2,5,3,2,5

												On prend un tower defense on y ajoute des éléments de gameplay propre à Team Fortress 2 y comprit le coté ""stylisé"" et on obtient l'un des meilleurs titres, ressemble fortement a Star Wars Battlefront dans des arenes plus petite.Deux camps s'opposent, le but est de détruire la ""Money-Ball"" de ses adversaires, qui se situe au sein de leur base. Vous contrôlez un personnage, choisi parmi 6 classes et qui doit à la fois repousser les assauts des ennemis et attaquer leur base. Des vagues d'unités contrôlées par la machine sont là pour vous aider et vous pouvez également placer des tourelles défensives.En réalité il s'agit d'un tower defence ce voulant dynamique ce qui est plutôt un bon point pour ces jeux où l'on est souvent spectateur, mais en regardant de plus près on peu ce rendre compte qu'il vaut vraiment le détours.16/20			",378,68,11,30,5,2,24

												I would like this game a lot more if there were people online to play with. But maybe I'm on at the wrong times. I dunno. Point is, it gets old just playing with Computers all the time. That being said, I'm still gonna recommend this game. The mode I always somehow end up playing is the one with robots. It's as if TF2's Mann vs Machine got refined and got some more modes of game play. For those of you not familiar with what I just reference, Mann vs Machine is a mode in TF2 where you battle robots of varying classes and once defeated drop money. If you successfully complete all 7 waves, you can then take the cash they drop to fund upgrades for whatever class you are playing. So the fact that this game is completely different but feels like another, I find very cool. Also, maybe I'm just playing this game wrong. You can tell from my logged hours I don't play much so I may be missing a lot. But if I can find a server with actual people playing, I'd be more likely to play more. But it seems I'll be waiting forever..  ",291,151,3,50,36,4,35

												[The game is dead now, don't buy it]It may be a fun game, but I don't recommend buying it. According to the achievements, around 40% of the people who own the game can't run it or haven't even played a single round. Plus, the game's popularity dropped to nothing just two weeks after its release. I have 41 out of over 100 friends who own the game, and none have played the game in the last two weeks. Also, only one has played more than 50 hours.I've yet to play more than two rounds of MNC myself, due to incompatibilities with my computer...I'd like to play, and if I could, I would play it occasionally, but that won't be happening anytime soon. :(			",221,44,8,16,13,1,45

												This is a good game with a pro game feel (even if undeserved, I don't know because I stopped playing after a few weeks.) However, for whatever reason, it has died. There are no more servers. The only way you could reliably play is if you were to play with all people you knew. Dont' get the wrong idea, single player can still be fun when you need a heart-pounding time waster. However, if you want to see how you match up to everyone else, dont' expect to be able to. They made a free to play version which flopped and now neither ever see the light of day. I fully blame the free to play. This version has been fixed and balanced out and deserves more attention. Don't expect Uber to fulfill promises about it. Don't expect anything you don't like to be fixed. Expect to have fun with friends but not on public servers. Until public servers become full again, it's not worth the investment. Also, don't encourage SMNC either.			",107,49,1,13,4,2,3

												At first this seemed like a really interesting mesh between the Tower Defense and Class FPS genres. However it soon becomes just more of the same shadowed by the TF2 giant.Right now it's pretty much dead considering the developers threw it into the garbage and released a freemium ""sequel"" with far more support. Tried the sequel for a bit but it still holds the same core problems. Just introducing new classes isn't enough if they're never truly engaging, which in a game like this is the big difference between staying or moving on forgetting the announcer voice, which was pretty much the only thing worth relating to...

												It'd get a thumbs-up: but Uber Entertainment has ditched MNC for Super Monday Night Combat, which then flopped about helplessly thanks to a Free To Play setup and being dropped like an ugly baby by Uber Entertainment not long after its conception.Both games are dead and I'm writing this review purely to get it out of my system:MNC *was* fun, had its fixable flaws, but then it got stabbed and left for dead in an alleyway.

												Monday Night Combat is possibly the best example of western consumerism you'll ever see. After all, who else would knock down the Great Pyramids because they'd ""gone out of style""?Monday Night Combat pits two teams (The Hotshots and the Icemen, who are Orange and Blue respectively) against each other in a battle to look cool as ♥♥♥♥. 6 different Pros are selectable, ranging from the executively cool Assault, who advises you to step aside due to his large step-taking, to the mentally deranged Sniper, who will more than likely want an official review on every kill that isn't his. Also in the playing leagues are bots, ranging from the Slim, a small, easy to destroy robot, to the Bouncer, a heavy, gorrila like bot that will easily turn Pros into Mash. Also on the playing field after being banned for 10 seasons is the JACKBOT XL, a heavy robot that only wants a cuddle but ends up killing those he attempts to cuddle.Please note: Not restricted to Monday.

												It may bear a resemblance to Team Fortress 2 at first glance, but it's really not all that similar. It is class based and has a similar art style, but that's about it. Monday Night Combat is really a hybrid between a third-person shooter and a tower defense game, and the mix works very well. It has an exaggerated TV sports presentation that is equal parts cool and hilarious, and leaves me fondly comparing it to Smash TV. Most importantly, it's a lot of fun.

												So Monday Night Combat (which, according to Bullseye [MNC official mascot] ""it's da best"") is a great game. It's basically like DotA, tower defense and TF2 class based action mixed together. Review done. Ship it.This game is not TF2. The only thing it really shares is the classes, but Uber Ent was able to advert the game being TF2, the characters are original enough and the class base traits and roles are unique (in a nutshell, having classes is like the only thing the game shares with TF2).MNC is one of my favorite Xbox games, and now that it is on the PC, I'm estatic. The content provided on the PC exceeds the Xbox version. And with a high replay factor, there really isn't much to lose.Verdict: BUY			",651,177,40,79,76,8,92

												Monday Night Combat is a third person shooter set in the future, where you play one of 6 different types of clones in a sporting setting (If you already didn't know that).The objective is not unlike DOTA - Push your bots to the enemy base and kill the bots coming to yours. It is very clear to see that alot of work has been put into this game - Uber Entertainment have gone all out with the theme. There is a proper commentary announcer present, the levels are HUGE stadiums and there are passive 'skills' known as Endorsements which are provided by 24 different sponsers.However, I feel as if the marketing people pushed this game into the world too early. There are alot of bugs, both gameplay wise and hardware/software specific.  I had to jump through hoops to even launch the game, then more to play it, only to be annoyed by more bugs in game.Do not buy this game unless you are prepared to play a Beta - I fail to see how this game even left Beta status in the first place.

You can complete nice achievements and the game is naturaly entertaining. You can have tons of fun with it, even with the low number of maps. I certainly recommend it.			",278,73,3,7,8,2,19

												Monday Night Combat is a very fun MOBA/Tower Defense/TPS shooter. Sadly, Über Entertainment has long abandonned this game and there are no longer any available servers to join. In its current state MNC should not be promoted nor sold since it is no longer playable. DO NOT waste your money on this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a great little class based, third person shooter.. Let's be honest though, just about everyone on ♥♥♥♥ing Steam has Team Fortress 2, and I'm sure the first thing that pops up in your hat craving heads is that this looks like a total rip off.. But I can hoestly say this is not at all. There are a total of six classes to choose from, all with different abilities that you can level up through the gaining of money. You gain money by killing an enemy, a bot, a turret, shooting the money ball, etc. Leveling up upgrades, and sometimes adds new skills for your character. There are different game types you can play, but one of them is to destroy the other team's money ball. You're in an arena pretty much, and you are given the choice to spend your money on skills for yourself, bots to send over, turrets to protect, or them all. I'd definitely recommend you shell out the 15 bucks and quit being a stingy ♥♥♥♥♥. It'll take a little getting used to, but once you do, you'll very much enjoy it.			",165,39,5,26,23,1,30

												This game straddles the line between TF2 (crazy, FPS mayhem!) and traditional CoD-style shooters (one player who knows how to move and how to aim can make all the difference). Can't aim? Play an engy and upgrade NPC towers for money. Great shot? Play a sniper and one-shot enemies. Either way, small teams and fun maps make each round action-packed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MNC is another class-based, team-based multiplayer first person shooter.  However, the style of the game is comical and outlandish, far more so than TF2.  The  different classes are all very satisfying to use, and each has a unique close-quarters finishing move that is absolutely awesome.  The integration of the mechanical armies into the game really creates a unique and crazy experiene.  I highly recommend this game.			",119,11,0,14,7,2,31

You were hungry, thirsty and groggy and the local super mart seemed like a good place to venture into those wee hours. You practically raided the place, with shopping carts becoming buggies, aisles becoming obstacle courses and personel a mere nuisance. Fun times were had that night, even with the succeeding jail time. You didn't regret doing it one inch and given the chance you'd do it again!Monday Night Combat is that same experience except it's a video game.			",458,105,9,57,37,4,65

												After trying to get this game to work on my computer, I have finally played this and MNC is basically a monday night football game with guns and combat. The game is very Dota like with Team Fortress 2 elements. You can choose classes too which some are similiar to TF2. Like the MNC assassin in comparasion to the TF2 spy. So the objective in this game, well one of them I played is moneyball. So teams with their classes need to escort so bots so they can take down defenses of the other team's moneyball and get some loot. So pretty fun. The flaw in this game might be the lack of new content, but the community is very very small. There are about 55 servers, but at day time, only a couple are filled in. I wouldn;t buy this game because there is hardly anyone toplay with. Wait for Super MNC.			",103,12,3,5,9,1,19

												This game straddles the line between TF2 (crazy, FPS mayhem!) and traditional CoD-style shooters (one player who knows how to move and how to aim can make all the difference). Can't aim? Play an engy and upgrade NPC towers for money. Great shot? Play a sniper and one-shot enemies. Either way, small teams and fun maps make each round action-packed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MNC is another class-based, team-based multiplayer first person shooter.  However, the style of the game is comical and outlandish, far more so than TF2.  The  different classes are all very satisfying to use, and each has a unique close-quarters finishing move that is absolutely awesome.  The integration of the mechanical armies into the game really creates a unique and crazy experiene.  I highly recommend this game.			",119,11,0,14,7,2,31

												Fun game, third person shooter/tower defense. Revolves around a ball of money contained in a sphere, called the Money Ball. Can play competitively, with both teams trying to get their swarms of robots to the enemy's moneyball to destroy it and win, or co-operatively, protecting the moneyball against increasingly difficult hordes of robots. Killing bots (or other players) gets you money, which you can spend on single-game character upgrades or turrets. And turret upgrades. While most games would pit red team against blue team, this game has ORANGE vs Blue, which is fine by me - orange is blue's actual opposite, after all. The characters don't have as much individual personality as Team Fortress 2's characters (which are hard to beat, kind of an unfair comparison?), but personalities do exist - most visibly with the Support class character. Good for those that enjoy both tower defense and third person shooters. If you prefer tower defense, play Blitz as a Support.			",161,11,0,23,12,0,35

Your goal is to destroy the enemy base using minion waves.  It may sound simple but the gameplay is great.  Give it a try if that hybrid type of game sounds interesting.			",111,23,2,15,10,2,16

You were hungry, thirsty and groggy and the local super mart seemed like a good place to venture into those wee hours. You practically raided the place, with shopping carts becoming buggies, aisles becoming obstacle courses and personel a mere nuisance. Fun times were had that night, even with the succeeding jail time. You didn't regret doing it one inch and given the chance you'd do it again!Monday Night Combat is that same experience except it's a video game.			",458,105,9,57,37,4,65

												Great team-based strategy/action game!  I would describe it as Team Fortress 2 style gameplay and graphics combined with the strategy and teamwork necessary in League of Legends.  Class diversity and working together are essential to win, as each map is split into several ""lanes"" where your team's robots (as well as the other team's on their side) spawn, and have a specific route they go depending on their lane.  Your job is to clear the way, while watching out for enemy ""Pro"" players (the classes are called ""Pros"") and killing them if necessary, which it usually is.  But don't be fooled, this game is not all about racking up the kills!  You will want to lead the robots to the opposing team's ""Money Ball,"" which can be considered the home base of their base, and have them attack it while you help.  The robots bring down the Money Ball's protective shield, but watch out for Turrets throughout the base!  If you find serious players who work together and talk, this game is VERY addicting!

												It's easy to confuse this game as a TF2 clone considering the cartoon style of the characters, however, the gameplay is nothing like that multiplayer classic. Gone are the massive servers crowded with dozens of players, opting instead for a 6 vs. 6 game where teamwork goes far towards winning the match. Matches are fast-paced and you'll find yourself running through half a dozen matches in a single sitting pretty quickly. It's easy to learn the basics but with a reward system that allows you to customize your characters abilities the more time you put in, you'll find yourself coming back with a new player design every chance you can. I highly recommend this multiplayer experience.			",745,212,16,112,55,5,140

												After trying to get this game to work on my computer, I have finally played this and MNC is basically a monday night football game with guns and combat. The game is very Dota like with Team Fortress 2 elements. You can choose classes too which some are similiar to TF2. Like the MNC assassin in comparasion to the TF2 spy. So the objective in this game, well one of them I played is moneyball. So teams with their classes need to escort so bots so they can take down defenses of the other team's moneyball and get some loot. So pretty fun. The flaw in this game might be the lack of new content, but the community is very very small. There are about 55 servers, but at day time, only a couple are filled in. I wouldn;t buy this game because there is hardly anyone toplay with. Wait for Super MNC.			",103,12,3,5,9,1,19

												My new favourite third person shooter. The 6v6 versus mode is not some generic team deathmatch, it includes defending your base with sentry guns then spawning and guiding AI robots to attack your enemies base for a start. Has a nice little co-op mode too where you defend against swarms of the robots in waves. The classes are well balanced and the game has a sponsorship system to slightly tweak your characters without going over the top. Stats, tags, money and leaderboards are all nice touches that may leave me spending a silly amount of time on this fun little game.			",415,93,14,34,16,5,54

												What a great little class based, third person shooter.. Let's be honest though, just about everyone on ♥♥♥♥ing Steam has Team Fortress 2, and I'm sure the first thing that pops up in your hat craving heads is that this looks like a total rip off.. But I can hoestly say this is not at all. There are a total of six classes to choose from, all with different abilities that you can level up through the gaining of money. You gain money by killing an enemy, a bot, a turret, shooting the money ball, etc. Leveling up upgrades, and sometimes adds new skills for your character. There are different game types you can play, but one of them is to destroy the other team's money ball. You're in an arena pretty much, and you are given the choice to spend your money on skills for yourself, bots to send over, turrets to protect, or them all. I'd definitely recommend you shell out the 15 bucks and quit being a stingy ♥♥♥♥♥. It'll take a little getting used to, but once you do, you'll very much enjoy it.			",165,39,5,26,23,1,30

												This game straddles the line between TF2 (crazy, FPS mayhem!) and traditional CoD-style shooters (one player who knows how to move and how to aim can make all the difference). Can't aim? Play an engy and upgrade NPC towers for money. Great shot? Play a sniper and one-shot enemies. Either way, small teams and fun maps make each round action-packed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MNC is another class-based, team-based multiplayer first person shooter.  However, the style of the game is comical and outlandish, far more so than TF2.  The  different classes are all very satisfying to use, and each has a unique close-quarters finishing move that is absolutely awesome.  The integration of the mechanical armies into the game really creates a unique and crazy experiene.  I highly recommend this game.			",119,11,0,14,7,2,31

												Fun game, third person shooter/tower defense. Revolves around a ball of money contained in a sphere, called the Money Ball. Can play competitively, with both teams trying to get their swarms of robots to the enemy's moneyball to destroy it and win, or co-operatively, protecting the moneyball against increasingly difficult hordes of robots. Killing bots (or other players) gets you money, which you can spend on single-game character upgrades or turrets. And turret upgrades. While most games would pit red team against blue team, this game has ORANGE vs Blue, which is fine by me - orange is blue's actual opposite, after all. The characters don't have as much individual personality as Team Fortress 2's characters (which are hard to beat, kind of an unfair comparison?), but personalities do exist - most visibly with the Support class character. Good for those that enjoy both tower defense and third person shooters. If you prefer tower defense, play Blitz as a Support.			",161,11,0,23,12,0,35

												Great game, which combines Tower Defence with Team Fortress in the style that one would see in the old Quake 1 game.The game is still in development, which causes some serious problems. That, along with terrible support from both the developers as Steam (which doesn't even list it in the troubleshooting section under 3rd party games) makes it a real pain if you want a simple LAN game with a buddy. Online gaming is generally available, if you can actually see any servers listed, which is not always the case.Some serious bugs and problems that need to be addressed before they worry themselves with game balancing, but somehow, that is all they are concerned about...P.S. If this looks like the kind of post one would expect on a forum or support site, I can't. My registration is still being processed (after a week of waiting) and I still can't get in touch with anybody that can actually solve any problems....P.S.S. It is still a great concept and fun to play, if you can....			",333,99,6,45,106,2,55

												Monday Night Combat (""MNC"") muses over the savage events that once took place in the ancient Colosseum, notably gladiatorial combat and the slaying of exotic beasts. MNC draws parallels to these events now alien to modern humans tamed with the domesticated and subdued format of what we now call ""sports."" In MNC, the combatants are not only supposed to mutilate one another, but also unautonomous ""bots"" on their way to glory. In the background is the audience; in the most literal sense of what Guy Debord calls ""the spectacle,"" we see the audience of MNC as mere shadows, replaced and defined instead by their fetish for the merciless spectacle of the arena. The overwhelming mass media advertising (so called ""endorsements"") of this future time reveals the financial underpinning and true consumerist nature of the event. MNC is a herald of a generation to come; warning of the lenghts to which rampant consumerism will go to ensure a profit.  In the world of MNC, the message is untimely.			",296,73,10,52,21,4,64

												Monday Night Combat is a 3rd-person shooter, whose objective is to destory the other team's moneyball with small arms fire. The catch is, however, that you can't destroy its initial shields yourself - AI controlled bots for your team must do that. Thus, you must escort them, destroy enemy bots, and let them bring down the shield so that your human players can finish the job.In practice, this game focuses less on racking up kills and soloing objectives (a near-impossible task), and requires teamwork and killing AI bots more than other players, which results in rewarding kills and less frustration for players who often have trouble staying alive.All the classes have their niche, and it is actually quite difficult to be a liability to your team. Even if you can't kill other players or stay alive for long, you can contribute greatly by stopping the advance of enemy teams' bots. This alone, in my opinion, makes the game a lot less frustrating than team-based shooters usually are.			",243,32,5,13,6,2,26

												I like this game because it's got a bunch of angry men who hate robots, but are willing to tolerate robots of their own colour because they hate robots of other colours even more. I think this game's subtexts of tolerance and racism ring true to the world at large. It teaches us lessons like don't taunt the Assassin just because she is a woman, and don't scoff at robots just because they are blue and you are not, especially not the fast robots that love hugging. I think they're called huggers. Star Trek The Next Generation was good about this kind of thing, too. I bet Monday Night (who names his kid ""Monday""?) took to heart Gene Roddenberry's deep meaningful messages, like how Geordi, a terrifying man-eating cyborg engineer, can befriend Data even though Data is a robot of a different colour from Geordi. But wait, no. The guys in Monday Night's Combat are enemies with their off-colour robotic counterparts! I don't get this at all. Where have you gone so wrong, Mr Night?			",101,47,1,14,19,2,19

												I reccomend this game because it's fun and better than the new one. The classic Blitz mode where you go up against waves of bots with up to 3 friends or randoms. Crossfire mode where you have to take out the enemy moneyball with your bots before they take out yours. How could you forget about the lovable Bullseye (The MNC mascot) who you can shoot for money! ""If you brought your sniper rifle from home, than you could take some shots at Bullseye and get a few bucks off the field!"" (not an exact quote) Although it may be a bit difficult to find a game all the time, there is still a loyal community that hosts events to play on the weekend or weeknights. One being Hotshots Forever (http://steamcommunity.com/groups/hotshotsforever/discussions/0/630802344396119611/) ,Had to put a discussion because the homepage wouldn't work, a group I am in myself (personally, I prefer Icemen, or the Blue team in games).

												This is an awesome game. It's a really good blend of Team Fortress 2 and Dota. Very tight combat and a high skill ceiling. In my opinion this game is better then Super Monday Night Combat.			",189,55,4,23,18,2,32

There's a fat bald guy who has a laser flamethrower which can ALSO charge you, a black guy who has an amazingly long-range and powerful grenade launcher, and worst of all, some girl who can instant-kill someone whilst invisible. It certainly is a terrible game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Цель игры такова: сопроводить роботов к золотому шару соперника и уничтожить его. Класы игроков напоминают персонажей из TF2. По ходу раунда можно улучшать характеристики персонажа. За убийство ботов или игроков даються деньги, за которые можно улучшить персонажа или построить пушки которые будут защишать ваш шар от ботов или игроков. Скажу чесно, хоть игра и содержит некие скопированые функции или режими с TF2, она все равно кажется довольно интересной и увлекательной.  ",408,84,17,38,13,2,42

												A mix of tower defense and Team Fortress 2. It's actually quite polished... and fun ! The graphics look great and the game itself plays great as well. The maps are a bit small though and there are sometimes too many glass barriers. One other thing I didn't really like were the controls for the 3 powers each character has. They aren't mapped in a way that you can press them quickly without confusing yourself. I've had countless times where I pressed the wrong key. It's a fast paced game, and the buttons are color coded with a number, that's it. Yes, you can map the keys yourself, but you're missing the point. The developers chose this specific control scheme. But it just doesn't make any sense. I had rather seen buttons with the correct keys on them, or icons that show exactly what the buttons do. It's a small, but important thing. Still, if you love (ok, ok... - or like - your choice) team based third person shooters this might just be the game for you. Definately worth a few tries.[Rating: 72/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												Monday Night Combat is a class-based, third-person shooter… and the most popular lethal sport of the future! It blends intense combat, finishing moves, and gameshow-like challenges and rewards to produce an action experience unlike any other. Why fight for “honor” or “duty” when you can fight for the real American dream: cash, fame and endorsements?			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

There are bots though.+ : sport/shooter/competitive, fun, graphics, third person, guns, turrets, some SP mode with bots- : no peeps8/10 for a game. Would combat again. So recommended justif you want to play with bots.			",557,147,15,58,38,5,106

												A game that would thrive with multiplayer, but nobody is playing. I have mixed feelings about the game because of this.Pros:- Decent gameplay mechanics- Graphics are fitting (Unreal Engine)- The announcer- Shooting mascots- Simple upgrade systemCons:- The tutorial blows through, leaving what it taught forgettable- Nobody playing multiplayer- Feels very abandoned by both, players and devs- Singleplayer doesn't feel very diverse, just different difficulties- Upgrade system might be a little too simple (not major, but it felt bland after other games)Overall, I want to recommend MNC because it really could be fun, but the singleplayer leaves a lot to be desired and the multiplayer is dead. While playing single, I felt like I didn't want to be doing what I was doing, but rather sharing the job(s) with someone else. In the end, it simply needs more players in order to be more interesting.			",255,48,8,32,14,2,17

												The Down Side to steam.Days of buying a game and actually being able to play it are over. When i bought this game I assumed(big mistake) that the developer would support it for more then half a year. Not possible I guess.Thanks to steam you don't really need to be serious about entertainment to put out a game. No need to design a box, set up distribution, invest in alternative forms of advertising or just put a solid effort into it. Now you can just take the initial influx of money that you received from all the rubes that thought a business had to stand behind their products, pull op anchor, sail around the island, drop anchor in the exact same place and sell the exact same crap again.I recommend this game or any game UBER entertainment regurgitates to all the rubes in all the lands.Monday Night CombatSuper Monday Night CombatPlanetary AnnihilationLoadout(I am told it's not an UBER game but they use the same resources as SMNC and it's just another knock off of the same game.)

												A fun multiplayer team based game. If you like TF2, chances are you will like Monday Night Combat. Though they make look similiar, both play very differently. At the moment it is lacking a little in variety but the developers promise future updates which will hopefully add new game modes and arenas.  All in all, it is a fun action packed game well worth the 15 bucks. Under 10 and it's a steal.			",277,51,11,30,28,0,53

												This game is basically Team Fortress and DotA combined. Escort bots to the enemy base, kill enemy bots and players to make money, use money to upgrade. Every class has a different role, and some classes hard-counter others.Weapons have tons of different uses too. The game's surprisingly deep for what it looks like. Only problem is that the Rocket Turrets take waaaaay too much abuse unless you're juiced. Otherwise everything's awesome.completely worth the 15 dollars			",160,23,3,8,14,1,19

												Monday Night Combat is a Multiplayer Third Person shooter with tower defense elements. Some people compare it to TF2 but other than some basic designs such as the class system I'd call that a lazy comparison. It plays and feels like an arena combat sports game where you are making a push towards the enemy money ball and with the help of your bots(creeps) you drop the shields and destroy it. The classes are a bit more hybridized that TF2. For instance there is a class that is like the medic and engy rolled together. You get to choose which stats to boost with money you earn through kills on bots and other players. You can also purchase and upgrade turret towers at fixed points in the map to slow the progress of the other team. It's a fun, cheap, sort of repatetive game that you can play when you want something a bit different. I'd recommend it but if you are looking for TF2 or some other shooter this one will feel different.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fantastic game of quick reflexes, stratagey and general skill. The player has to decide whether to spend their money on towers to defend their base, on bots to help push forward to the opponents money ball or to upgrade your skills. There are 6, well balanced classes to choose from, each with their own skills that define them and make them strong to certain class but weak to others.

												I stand by giving this game 9/10 however since the developer has stopped all support including multiplayer servers I can't in good conscience recommend this game anymore.The best way to describe this is as TF2 meets DotA.  A third person class based shooter where the objective is to escort your bots into the enemies base destroying enemies, bots and turrets in your way.  New players may find the concept of having to kill bots rather than human opponents confusing at first but it is worth getting past the initial learning curve.  Just don't decide to play as the assassin on your first outings as you will likely suck at it until you have learnt the game mechanics and your team will hate you.9/10			",164,22,7,41,12,0,19

												This game is simply great. Its a mix between TF2 + DotA(or LoL), but its in its own (and new) genre. Third-person classed based tower-defense shooter. The objective is simple, guide the bots into the enemy base so they can breach the sheilds of the moneball, only they can breach it. Bots spawn at a constant rate.  After that you lay waste to it, but watch out for the base turrets! Five classes, each one can be upgraded with 4 skills, which cost money. Money is simply earned from killing or picking up the coins on the ground. One main downside is few maps.- 8/10			",328,46,5,37,29,2,45

If you have spare cash, you can even buy your class's own specialty bot and have it help you exterminate other players. Worth what little money it costs.			",90,8,0,14,5,0,4

												I want to like this game. But I don't. All the fun of leveling a character and shooting rcomputer-controlled enemies just falls to♥♥♥♥♥♥when you have to face another player, an experience I've had in several MOBAs (I'm looking at you, League of Losers). MNC has the tactical depth and player base of your typical free to play game, while demanding skill and and dedication better spent on TF2. And I can say that with a completely straight face, because TF2 at least USED to be about skill and dedication. MNC only pretended to be. Then again, you can just play Blitz, which I always found much more fun. The fact that MNC's upcoming sequel IS a free to play game with microtransactions simply hammers home my point. If you MUST play such a game, at least play Tribes: Ascend. At least until they ♥♥♥♥ THAT up. If they haven't already, I haven't decided yet.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												Essentially a third-person, FPS/MOBA hybrid with a gameshow feel to it, Monday Night Combat has seemingly outlived it's hayday.Monday Night Combat has some great features to it, nice sound, humorous announcers and characters.  There is a variety of weapons to use, the game has fun, bright, colorful graphics and visuals.  You can choose from 6 different classes for your character to try and combat the enemy team better.  The game, overall, seems like it would be pretty fun.I say pretty fun, because if you're like me, and looking to jump into the game anytime now or afterwards, you will be disappointed.  The multiplayer servers have all but been shut down.  There is essentially no way to play this game multiplayer without gathering up your own friends to play and hosting your own game, otherwise, there's really nobody left to play the game, and therefore I cannot recommend it.  It seems like it would have been fun if it had the kind of following the big MOBAs like LoL and Dota have today.I cannot recommend this game to anyone, for any reason.  Without anyone to play the game with on the regular, this game is nothing more than a waste of money at this point.			",386,94,5,50,42,2,43

												Monday Night Combat is a Multiplayer Third Person shooter with tower defense elements. Some people compare it to TF2 but other than some basic designs such as the class system I'd call that a lazy comparison. It plays and feels like an arena combat sports game where you are making a push towards the enemy money ball and with the help of your bots(creeps) you drop the shields and destroy it. The classes are a bit more hybridized that TF2. For instance there is a class that is like the medic and engy rolled together. You get to choose which stats to boost with money you earn through kills on bots and other players. You can also purchase and upgrade turret towers at fixed points in the map to slow the progress of the other team. It's a fun, cheap, sort of repatetive game that you can play when you want something a bit different. I'd recommend it but if you are looking for TF2 or some other shooter this one will feel different.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fantastic game of quick reflexes, stratagey and general skill. The player has to decide whether to spend their money on towers to defend their base, on bots to help push forward to the opponents money ball or to upgrade your skills. There are 6, well balanced classes to choose from, each with their own skills that define them and make them strong to certain class but weak to others. Overall, a fun, entertaining and well balanced game that never gets old.			",60,4,0,8,6,1,14

												Monday Night Combat is a fantastic third person shooter that combines tower defense with a little bit of MOBA.  The graphics are appealing to look at especially if you're into the cartoony TF2 style, and the game plays very smoothly.  Overall a very fun experience and perfectly priced.So why am I not recommending this?  For one simple reason; the company behind this game seriously ♥♥♥♥ed up everything that made it even playable.  All servers are down, and to make it worse you can't even create your own without the game just crashing on you.  So the only way to play this game is to play it solo, which defeats the entire purpose of a fun multiplayer tower defense game.  I had a lot of good things to say about this one, but in its current state I can't recommend it.  In the famous words of The Angry Video Game Nerd: ""What's the most important aspect of any game?  Being able to ♥♥♥♥ing play it!""			",160,3,1,10,4,0,9
