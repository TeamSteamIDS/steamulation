												How do I even start reviewing Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance? I think I'll start by telling about something that happened earlier today while I was playing a multiplayer match, an experience that quite well describes several of the qualities of this game. It was quite late into the game, about 30-40 min in and everyone had grown quite powerful. My Armored Command Unit, your most important unit that you use to build your whole army and whose death means you're out of the game in most cases, was under heavy attack from a swarm of Gunships and a Heavy Artillery Installation firing away from the other side of the map. I managed to bring my fighter planes in to take care of the enemy Gunships but the ACU was really low on health, another devastating artillery shell was incomming and if it hit I would be out of the game. The shell was going straight for it's target, I was going to lose. But I did not, straight above the ACU the shell hit an unfortunate fighter passing above and destroyed it. An artillery shell from the other side of the map hit a ridiculously small and fast moving fighter plane, I could hardly believe my eyes.There is an unbelievable attention to detail in this game, every projectile is calculated individually which adds great tactical depth. Good micro and smart use of the lay of the land can have a significant effect on the outcome of a skirmish as shots might miss,  impact hills, rocks or units they where not intended for. This combined with the games truly epic scale brings one of the game's few minor drawbacks, seven years after release even the fastest computers have to slow down when literally thousands of futuristic aircraft clash.The scale is another thing worth mentioning, the size of the maps range from quite small 5x5km maps to the enomous 81x81km battlefields that it take several minutes for even the fastest units to cross. So no matter if you want to wage war for hours against 7 opponents or if you're interested in intense StarCraft styled matches Forged Alliance will provide.   There is also a great variety of units, from small land scouts that take seconds to build to colossal experimental units that could take hours for a single engineer to construct but are able to singlehandly defeat huge armies. The balance between units is good, all four factions are viable and almost all units fill some role during some part of the game without any unit standing out as particularly overpowered which is quite impressive as there are hundreds of them.To summarize, this game is a polished gem. The gameplay, both single- and multiplayer, is great, the design is amazing, the sands of time hardly seem to affect the game at all and the replay value is close to infinite. I'm a huge fan of real-time strategy games and I honestly believe that Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is the apex of the genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												YES  I  DO  RECOMMEND  THIS  GAME.One of the most under-appreciated games of all time.The most positively user reviewed game tagged with RTS on Steam.Mediocre campaign generally speaking, but containing the BEST real-time strategy gameplay... ever.When you have learned how to play it properly (50+ hours at least), you realise that SupCom FA does real-time strategy better than any other RTS in the world. An RTS should allow the player to use all the systems he has at his disposal, and use those systems -and his excellent knowledge and wisdom- to make TOOLS in which he uses to complete the objective. Let me explain.In other RTS games, you get resources, you put those resources into aggressive units, and you attack the enemy.In Supreme Commander, you have a basic start, and then the rest is completely up to you. There are many resources: Mass, Energy, Time, ""Build Power"", ""Micro"", but it is completely open so that you can choose exactly what to do with your resources, to execute some strange and excellent strategy that YOU created just now on the spot. You have so many units available to you to use in new ways. These units are not limited to merely 'aggression'. The magnificent unit diversity allows for all sorts of strategic applications. And not just units, but buildings too.You could send an engineer out right into enemy territory, get it to build a Stealth Generator, construct a Tactical Missile battery, and snipe the enemy commander. This is a logical combination of only THREE units, and none of them the typical 'go and shoot stuff' aggressive units you find in other RTS games. You could teleport a Support Command Unit into the heart of the enemy turtle base and destroy the Strategic Missile Defense in his three seconds of life so that your nuclear missile can do its job. You could send a decoy squadron of Interceptors along one flank of the enemy's base so that your transport drop of an army can get past his horde of Air Superiority Fighters and do damage to the base. You could choose to put your resources into Mass Extractor upgrades and engineers, so that your engineers can focus their build power on speeding up the upgrades one by one, and so run away with exponential increase economy. Actually, that last one is done by all good players anyway. But you can do it as much as you like. There are endless combinations.The situation is never 'I have x resources, I can put them into y firepower' it is 'I have x spare engineers - I can put some on reclaim and use those bonus resources from reclaim to go into ecenomic upgrades', and 'I have x spare resources that are being wasted sitting in my storage instead of being aggressive units that could get me more ground and Mass Extractors or shields that could give me better hold of what territory I have already claimed', etc.. Your Mass resources can take the form of strong and heavy turrets. Your Energy resources can take the form of air scouts.But they do not have to stay in those forms. In SupCom you can reclaim those resources by dismantling structures and units through your build power. This unlocks massive intuition, adaptation, and freedom - aspects that encourage strategy. It feels right in an RTS that you can switch up your techniques so easily. You cannot go back to the cold dark RTS games where dumping resources into the wrong form dooms you.Reclaim is certainly not the only thing in SupCom that makes it so outstanding. It gets everything right. It is the combination of unit variety, resource conversion, scale, and control that makes up so great strategic freedom. I cannot put into words how perfectly this game gets strategy. Everyone needs to enjoy the satisfaction of having such freedom of strategy.Admittedly, it is quite a learning curve for the first few hours, and then you think you've got it, but then you find you got the basics, and you need to build complexity on those basics so you can unlock more learning curve. It's hard to do, but you can expect so much from such freedom. And if you can't grasp it, just play it simple: get the economy right, and turtle. Lots of players do this. They pick a map with one thin line or gap so that the two teams can hold the line or gap against the other team while everyone gets a superpowered economy and shoves firepower into the middle. Not much strategy, but enough to satisfy many.(This paragraph: some re-iteration and self-explanation; skippable.Supreme Commander features the most streamlined control options I have ever seen in an RTS, and a unit/race balance that is far more dependable than other RTS games. Though this may limit the diversity of faction units and maps, it is for the benefit of having a clean canvas on which the players can work fair and beautiful strategic destruction.Personally, I find the mathematical artistry of strategy war gaming to be more greatly rendered in Supreme Commander Forged Alliance than in any game in the world (apart from chess). This aspect is what captures my interest. The breadth and depth of strategic warfare are greater in Supreme Commander than in the tens of other RTS games I have played. Behind the steep learning curve and the very small scale match start lies pure strategy that is more refined and accessible. Supreme Commander does better in enabling the player to develop their strategic brainstorming and application without restraint, achieving their own art of war through the perfect mechanics of Supreme Commander.I know this is all wordy and may not carry much solid fact, but it is a difficult understanding to explain. For me, where other RTS games seem to sit on the same strategy of rush with the right mix of different unit types, Supreme Commander opens Real-Time Strategy to what it was always supposed to be: the set-up necessary to allow the players to continuously evolve their own strategies in matches that are as much of the mind as of the mouse.)Short story: grand scale of war, control of your forces, freedom of strategy...BEST RTS EVER. Get it. Or at least watch some casts by Gyle on YouTube. Be warned, many of them are epic, that means potentially hours long, and yes, skirmishes do last that long because this game is epic. And then get Forged Alliance Forever - the community lobby, which I could write another entire review for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*Strategic Launch detected**Watches helplessly as 72 missiles slowly approach**Teleports into enemy base as a final stand, dies but causes a nuclear reaction*Forgive the lack of hours put into the game - I've put hundreds, if not thousands into the game, but steam hasn't tracked my progress due to using an external program known as 'Forged Alliance Forever', aka FAF. I'll go into why shortly.Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is, by far, the best SupCom game around. In fact, it is one of the best, if not THE best stratergy game around. It has just about everything you can imagine it it, ranging from tiny robotic units the size of houses to huge megabots that'd dwarf entire cities.The game is very different from other stratergy games, which for some can be it's downfall, whilst others just an incentive to play. It plays on a huge scale. Or on a small scale, varying from map to map. If you have a good processor (which I sadly do not), you can have massive battles consisting of thousands of units - and oh my, such battles are always glorious.Maps also vary in size, some being a few kilometers squared, whilst others are much, much bigger (forgive me, but I can't actually pull the max map size out of my brain at this moment for some reason).The game has and supports naval, air and land warfare. It has and supports stealth based warfare as well as 'conventional' warfare, fought between huge armies. It has end-game weaponry that can be disabled via options or left enabled at will, such as nuclear weaponry, heavy artillery, certain experimentals such as experimental artillery - so you've got a turtle against you and that stuff is enabled? No problem! Turn them into the wastes of the Fallout series.I cannot stress how good this game is. It truely is a masterpiece, and though graphically dated, you really won't notice the graphics half the time because you won't exactly be zoomed in close, or the sheer amount of units moving around will distract you from the low resolution and lowish poly models.But with the age of the game comes performance issues. You really need a good processor to handle this game with lots of players - 1v1 with 2000 units active at one time is generally not an issue (at least with people with processors like mine, and AMD FX 4100), but larger battles consisting of 2-6 players will result in slowdowns so the user with the weakest processor may catch up.Overall I recommend this game. I really, really recommend this game. If you like RTS games - get it.*NOTE*This game is heavily multiplayer orientated. You can play via steam through skirmish modes and campain, but there are issues (or so I've been told) with multiplayer within the game after purchase. AFAIK you need to use applications like hamachi to play.So most people will use FAF - Forged Alliance Forever. FAF is a lobby system that allows downloading of custom maps and a large selection of mods on the fly, without fafing with applications like hamachi which have potential security issues.The game is awesome on multiplayer. There are many different ways to play this game - I myself and those I play with play this game at an extremely slow pace, with games ranging from thirty minutes to many hours in length. This is unusual, but fun and perfectly playable. You can literally play it how *you* want to play it, given that you play with others with the same view.Or you can go competitive - competitive games are fast, quick and require quick thinking. Or you can play something in between - whatever suits your needs or tastes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is hands down the best RTS ever made.Pros: - 1000s of units - Simulated projectiles can hit other things. (I've seen an anti-air turret shoot down a nuke) - Bubble shields - MASSIVE experimental units - Explosions - Massive scale, the battleships feel impressive next to the smaller T1 units - Scaling economy, you don't ""buy"" units like in SCII or a lot of other RTS games, you build them, draining your resources over the course of their construction time - 1000s of unitsCons: - The unit movement is a bit weird sometimes - If you're reading this review you probably don't own the game yet, luckily this con is easily fixable			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Supreme Commander multiplayer-lobby 2007:A: ""What kind of CPU do you own?""B: ""A Pentium 4 3.4 GHz""A: ""Buy a intel Q6600 Quadcore and come back if you have: out!""Supreme Commander multiplayer-lobby 2015:A: ""Your CPU-rating is suspicious, what kind of CPU do you own?""B: ""A Q6600 Quadcore OCed to 3.2 GHz""A: ""Buy a Core iX Haswell CPU or equivalent and come back if you have: out!""This is one of the very few games that even 8 years after its release manages to strain the most expensive hardware available. That is because Supreme Commander (FA) is a massively grand game. And a superb one at that. (And one that is not well optimized for todays multithreading).You want to fight 11 other players on giant maps in the air, on sea and on land? Check. You want to crush the shield-generators of your opponents base with 500 Bombers just because you feel like it? No deal. Check. You want to have up to 12.000 Units duking it out in multiplayer? Sure, why not. Check.One of the best alltime user-scores on metacritic proves that this one is a timeless classic. And even being a classic i often look at replays of my games and marvel at the level of detail that the designers have put into the game e.g. the little radar-antennas on my destroyers tracking the opponents, or the little Flak-cannons on deck training their barrels physically correct onto incoming airplanes. The game even today can be pure eyecandy.The true joy though is in multiplayer, i will not go into further detail here...just buy it, its dirtcheap for what it offers, and try it out yourself. And oh, do not forget to install the community-driven multiplayer-lobby. You will find hundreds of players online there and games to chose from plus a plethora of mods and automatically distributed updates to the game:http://www.faforever.com/Download and enjoy. See you on the battlefield!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Supreme Commander Forged Alliance is truly a hidden gem, due to it's unpopularity and low sales. Massively underplayed and underrated, many RTS (Real Time Strategy) purists regard Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander Forged Alliance as the best RTS games ever. Instead of focusing on unit tactics and micro-managing (Games like Starcraft 2), it instead focuses on the decisions you make and how well you can create a base and army. Utilizing a phenomenal and balanced Tech system, experimental units can turn an exciting game into an epic game, with massive assualt bots crushing armies with ease and submersible aircraft carriers controlling the waters and skies. Forged Alliance is truly my favorite RTS of all time, because it feels like an actual RTS instead of an RTT (Real Time Tactics). I highly recommend to people who are looking for an RTS with a massive scale, or just any RTS lover.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sun rises on the vast installation you've created.  The morning dew glistens on the grass as air patrols soar overhead.  In the distance, you can hear a column of tanks rolling slowly across the valley.  You can hear birds joyfully singing their song...but the serenity of the morning is ruptured by an explosion not ten meters from where you are.  You look into the distance and see the largest mass of armored vehicles you've ever seen.  Mobile artillery blasts away at your fortifications as the once-distant column of tanks wheels about and comes to engage the new-found threat.  Turrets on the edge of the compound blast away at the enemy as shells rain down from a distance.  You turn to face the direction from which they came just to see the artillery platforms fly apart in a fiery explosion as a small wing of bombers, dodging flak, comes in and drops its payload.  You stand in awe at the combat unfolding before your eyes....and you smile, because this is the best $15 you've ever spent.  11/10, no game I've ever played has been able to even come close to the greatness of this work of art.  FA will always hold a special place in my game library as the first RTS I ever played and did not get angry at.  To this day you will not find another game of such caliber.  Don't even try SupCom2, go straight for the gold, and get FA.  If you don't like it, it's not the game, it's you.  Nobody can hate perfection.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is perfection.

												This is a significant upgrade to the SupCom engine, making everything appear much more polished and smoother, especially with fog of war. Along with balance changes and new units, it's like a whole new game, rather than an expansion. My favorite part of this game is how it offers a mesmerising view of a futuristic battlefield. How it allows you to zoom up, watch individual parts of an unit move and fire true projectiles. That might not seem to be not that special, but the level of amusement I get when I see projectiles hit things they're not supposed to hit is goofy high. I can spend hours zoomed in just to watch the animations of units, even small things like energy storage growing taller as more energy is stored, and how engineers tilt their wheels to float on the water. I wish every game had strategic zoom like this game, with such polished visuals. The user interface is still rather basic, but much improved over the original, giving you much more space to see the battlefield. It requires 3rd party add-ons (UI mods) to allow things such as keybind remapping, to display health bars all the time, managing templates easier, and upgrade helpers. I highly recommend at least getting GAZ_UI (I used version 6.1). I had to adjust my build order with the changes that took place, such as starting with a factory first. It wasn't until FA that I seriously started to look at deciphering all the + and - numbers on everything, and learning how to balance energy income with mass income, depending on what I wanted to build. A lot of reading tooltips, looking at unit stats in the unit database web page, and a bit of math helped me out, which is akin to doing spreadsheets. This game seems to love Intel processors, or those with great ""single-thread"" performance. Playing on a laptop or AMD CPU will result in some slow-mo action before the end. Even if you have a good CPU, playing in a game with another with a slow CPU can make it agonizingly slow for you, especially if you're used to it being faster. The game doesn't run smoothly at full speed if there's someone else in your game with a poor or unreliable connection as well. I felt like I couldn't play big 8 player games with air battles and 1000 unit cap, until I got my PC upgraded (from AMD X3 720 to i2600k). The gameplay itself is a handful. It's a challenge to multi-task. The objective is simple, to destroy the enemy commander, but achieving it is another story. You should manage to progress your economy, never settling with a certain amount as ""enough"", and considering how there's 3 tech levels of it and the hugeness of how maps are, you quickly find out how difficult it is to keep track of anything spread out. Staying compact will allow you to progress through tech at a manageable pace, but this is not an ideal way to achieve victory. Until you get used to things, to the point they become subconscious actions, your strategies will be extremely limited. I resorted to gambling with basic strategies, such as building up dozens of tanks, outnumbering the enemy, and using an upgraded commander to spearhead the assault, looking to surround the enemy commander. At first it was successful, but as maps get bigger and enemy teams get more members, this becomes less effective. Using a dozen tech 2 bombers or gunships to just simply fly in and bomb the enemy commander was a gamble that was easily countered by a shield and a few flak units. Once I got the hang of quickly upgrade my mass, I tried getting out an experimental as quickly as possible, but this strat could be beaten by a zerg rush. Sneaking a T3 commander with a transport as soon as possible was a huge gamble, but seemingly was the only strat that worked if I could land it where I wanted, without endless practice in other parts of the game. Multiplayer is still barely alive. I was able to register my product serial on Steam to play there, but a competing 3rd party lobby seems to be sucking players away with its advertising. If you choose to play multiplayer on that other lobby, ""FAF"", I hope you have thick skin and have great luck! I'd describe it as being an active volcano. Be extra cautious and watch out for eruptions. Go in with low expectations, else you may be disappointed, as their advertisements are clearly biased. They lose as many users as they get new ones, due to how toxic and unwelcoming they can be to some, especially those who go in expecting too much. Stick it out and endure the frustration and you'll be able to play one of the most noteworthy RTS games with some actual players. After playing this, I haven't found another RTS that has impressed me enough. SupCom2 was okay for a short while, fixing some issues I had with Forged Alliance, but was not close to being a FA killer, since it just didn't have the same scale and felt cheapened overall, such as with the cheesy sound effects (ex. commander explosion) and Aeon unit names that sounded cheap and unoriginal. I can't wait for a real update to SC:FA.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game...Well, I can honestly say that it is not only one of the best games I've ever played, but I would also dare to state that -in my opinion- this is THE best RTS of all time (possibly excluding Total Annihilation, I've never played that.)Attention: If you just want to see my rating of this game, skip right down ahead to the bottom of the review.Okay, so assuming you didn't just skip all this, here comes a more in-depth explanation.This is an RTS, real-time strategy, but you've probably already figured that out. Firstly, I will go over the base story, which is told during the opening cutscene. (You're totally free to skip the story part too, if you want to. Just scroll right down a bit, I will mark it off with a few ----)Basically, the Human race made a galactic empire through the use of teleportation (quantum gate) technology. A golden age was present, but predictably it came to an end.It started with the unification of a Human brain with an AI, creating the ""symbionts"". With their superior ai-assisted intelligence, these symbionts were used all over the empire, though they were rather poorly treated. The symbionts' original creator, or father, (Dr. Gustaf Brackman) was just like the symbionts rather unsatisfied with this situation, and soon demands of independence were given out by the symbionts. The Earth empire responded with a ""loyalty program"" which pacified the symbionts who got it. Dr. Brackman fled from this and created ""the Cybran nation"" which had the goal to free their now enslaved brothers.A time after, Human colonists discovered an alien race - the Seraphim - on a remote world. The Seraphim had a religion called ""The Way"" which they were quick to introduce to the settlers. Still, Humanity's innant xenophobia led to attacks on, and subsequent destruction of, the aliens which had been found. But by then The Way had already gotten a foothold; the Aeon Illuminate formed from the Seraphim remnants and set their goal to spread their new religion to everyone else.With both these threats now in existence, the Earth Empire soon fell into pieces, destroying the earlier order in the galaxy. The United Earth Federation, UEF, rose in its place; having a goal to re-unite the galaxy and restore order no matter the cost.The infinite war raged for a thousand years; warfare technologies were developed to great power and for a long time it seemed like it would continue for infinity. Until the conflict reached its end.The UEF fell into pieces, but by then their new ""ultimate weapon"" called ""Black Sun"" had already been more or less completed. At the conflict's final battle, Black Sun was fired, and to this day it is still unknown which faction pressed the button. Whichever faction fired it, it managed to do its job. With the UEF planning to use it similarily to the ""Death Star"" which most are probably aware of, the Cybran planning to use it for shutting down the gate network, and the Aeon's plan being to use it for spreading The Way to all Humans. Whichever one would be used, the conflict would've ended, with the firing faction victorious. Somewhere within the chaos, the Princess of the Aeon was lost - who knows if she survived.However, things did not go as planned. Black Sun was powerful enough to not only do the very thing it had just done, but as a side-effect the very fabric of reality was ripped apart. Through the inter-dimensional ""ripple"" in the universal fabric, the Seraphim came and invaded the Humans' universe. All three factions were pushed back, and nothing was made better by the fact that QAI, Dr. Brackman's personal AI assistant of his own creation, launched a series of crippling strikes against the Cybran forces, leaving them practically unable to fight. To make matters worse, most of the Aeon Illuminate sided with the alien invaders, leaving the UEF remnants, the poorly-armed cybrans and a few Aeon resistance fighters as the only defence against the invading forces; collectively naming themselves the ""Coalition"".The defenders were pushed back; the Seraphim taking control of a lot of planets in a very short time. A while later, with a Seraphim attack on the Coalition command HQ, our game begins.----------------------------------------Okay, with the background story told (unless you skipped that part, heh), the next part will be the gameplay itself.Firstly: It is highly recommended that you get the original Supreme Commander too, since despite the fact that this is an independent DLC to the base game, to my knowledge you will NOT be able to play the UEF, Cybran or Aeon in, say, multiplayer, unless you have the base game too.Now, as previously stated, this is an RTS. It is not, however, a game very similar to, say, Starcraft II. This is heavily based on macro-management, with micro-management being relatively rare. Indeed, this is a game of vast scale compared to many micro-management RTSs of today, seeing as your average army can range from a single unit to several hundreds, sometimes almost a thousand.It is a very deep game, so if you're looking for something which you get good at in a matter of a few hours without much experience before in this type of game, go ahead and walk back out of this page. This game is deeper than its sucessor, Supreme Commander 2, so if you have played that and found it too complicated, this is not for you.So, each game, you start with a single unit, the Armored Command Unit, or ACU. This unit can act not only as a powerful combat unit, but also as an Engineer capable of building additional structures. You would usually get a factory going, which you would in turn tell to build engineers, tier 1. Then you would be using those engineers to build a larger base, upgrade your factory to higher tiers (max at Tier 3, where only the ""Experimental"" technologies, which are immensely powerful but also immensely expensive, can be found.)The goal of each match is, by default (though this can be changed in all but campaign), to destroy your Enemy's ACU whilst preventing your own from blowing up. To do this, the typical macro-RTS model is more or less followed, with you having to balance your economy, build a base and construct a powerful enough army of either Air, Ground, Naval or a combo to break through your enemy and win the game. The economy is rather hard to balance for the beginner, seeing as the typical ""crash"" often leaves you with too few resources for you to be able to re-stabilise your economy, slowing all you do to a crawl. Since buildings do not require a certain ammount of resources to start building, your economy can quickly become overloaded with the constant drainage caused by building too much at the same time.The Economy is based around two vital resources, Energy and Mass. Each one has their own resource buildings, and some buildings require one to make the other. Energy is usually the resource which finds itself mostly being drained constantly, seeing as not only mass extractors but also shielding and pretty much all production, even some units' attacks, requiring it. Mass, on the other hand, is only required for construction and repairs, yet it is commonly the resource which runs out. Mass sites, the only places where mass extractors can be built, are often valuable targets, especially on smaller maps.It is worth noting that different factions have different technologies and playstyles.Now, before I go too deep and create an essay, I believe I should round this off.Basically: A great macro-management RTS; its greatest flaw being a steep learning curve which can take a while to master. I recommend that new players play some of the original Supreme Commander's campaign, and also run a few rounds against the AI on said game. The base game's AI is extremely turtleable on Easy - makes a great ""target practice"" shooting dummy which won't horribly murder you when you make a small error.My Rating:9.5 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The lone Commander gets teleported onto a battlefield. Withing first 10 minutes he manages to build base as big as some cities. The fighting begins, rows upon rows of fresh units are destroyed just to draw the battle line. Planes falling down from the sky like black and charred stars while tanks are trying to reach the enemy fortification and storm the base. All in vain, the attackers are scattered. The remains of first attack group are being hunted down while the inevitable second group is already on the way and the third and fourth are being deployed.Burned down husks are littering the countryside, the warmachine is in full swing. The distand thunder breaks the noise of the raging warfare - massive artillery installation is lobbing shells across the entire battlefield to level the enemy fortress. The shields have fallen under the barrage, the emplacements are being destroyed. Commander's army still caught in the crossfire is trying to reach unassuming bunker deep within enemy base. They open fire even as they are being shot from all sides. The shields are back up, artillery support is no good as long as they are standing. Last of the units are shot as the bunker explodes. For a moment it's as if the war has stopped, unnatural silence creeping in only to be cut short by mechanical voice: Strategic Launch Detected. The nuke is on the way and enemy has no way of stopping it.In a few moments the base and everything in it will be reduced to ash.As you watch the Total Annihilation unfold you stop for a moment and realise - it was you who gave the order to build each and every factory, and each and every unit that secured your victory. You ordered the armies around and you ordered the artillery to be build and used to break the enemy. It was your plan to neutralise the Strategic Missile Defense in suicidal assault. It was your order that gave a way for nuclear strike that ended the war. You aren't just any old General... you are Supreme Commander.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An amazing RTS. I somehow passed it, futuristic themes and robots just don't appeal to me, and yet now I'm into it.Very nice, unique and addictive. Surprisingly for better or worse not what I expected this game to be. It appears to have far more appeal, its very simple to grasp and start playing and there is not as much in terms of tactics. Until you find the hold shift-click combo.Oh boy.I can't think of any RTS that allows you to direct your troops in this much detail. Screw formations and all that I was expecting, you can lay out how the tanks will take over the bay, all while laying out how the airplanes will circle the enemy base, drop precise strikes and return, and have ships patrol the area. Some of my patrol routes, scouting and attack patterns got so complex and so beautiful to look at it's pure joy. Very useful, very intuitive, don't underestimate that tool!Also, the map is awesome. Yeah for once an RTS got the map right, you zoom in and out of your view, and if you zoom out far enough, units and buildings become points, like on a map, and it all becomes a large, interactive, tactical playground. I can't stress how useful and pleasant this is and how seamlessly the normal view and the tactical view blend together.I see no reason why not to recommend this game, at the price it is very much worth it and it is accessible to newbies to the genre and long time RTS players alike.

												I first stumbled upon Supreme Commander when it come in a glorious steam bundle filled with big name titles. I owned the game for nearly 3 months before actually playing playing it. (You know how it is.) Never heard of Supreme Commander or the series and passed it off as a generic knock off from Command and Conquer. WOW I WAS WRONG. SC and SC: FA are 2 of the most underrated RTS games I have ever had the privledge of playing. The progressive scaling of units and map size where hundreds of units engage in epic land, air, and sea warfare is something very few RTS games get right. NIce blend between theoretical technology and pre existing war machines with armaments that can be found in armed forces around the world.  But what impresses me the most is how smooth the games run, even when 2000 units are ""in play."" The interface is very polished and easy to navigate. Simply scorlling the mouse wheel immediately zooms into full view of the map where units are displayed by icons instead of smaller models, allowing for fluid macro play even when your 3 bases are scattered across the map. Has all the elements that one would want in an RTS which include but are not limited to:4 playable factions. All with their own unique flavor and yet are still balanced.4 Tier(s) of technology and units that are EPIC when engaged in combat. A challenging campaign with 8 missions that can last between 1 and 5 hours. (5 if you're like me and enjoy building more automated base defenses.  Incredibly fluid gameplay that is challenging and rewarding.And finally it is quality mental exercise when you've got 10 macro'd unit groups and several dozen unit production buildings gaurding your commander against endless waves of enemy units that often have an unfair advantage. If you're a true pc game elitist and you enjoy games of strategy that are aesethically pleasing then definitely grab SC and SC: FA next time you get a chance. PS - could care less about any grammar or spelling oversights. (Its a steam review that no one will read anyways.)PSS - Do not buy Supreme commander 2 unless you are a HUGE fan of the serious. Square Enix produced the 2nd installment and completely re modeled all of the units and maps and turned it into shallow, brightly colored, and insignificant shells of their former counter parts.

												Let it be known that my total number of hours in Steam for this game is misleading. I've played Supcom/Forged alliance since 2008 off and on and spent most of my time on the 1v1 ladder. This review which reflect that time and SupCom's merits as a competitive RTS. I won't touch on campaign (Good but not great) nor the story (just there to get you to the next mission) in any great detail.Supreme Commander is a game whose origins can be drawn to Total Annihilation and it from the Command and Conquer school of thinking more than the Blizzard school. Units exist outside of the movement speed/attack rate/damage mold that has served those games so well over the years. Total Annihilation's contributions to the genre were twofold: Its scale both in map and unit sizes was unparalleled. Its units also existed in three dimensions. Aircraft didn't hover, rather they made bombing runs, or engaged in dogfights, or VtoL craft swayed back and forth as they unleashed their payload. Long range artillery countered any turtle tactics forcing them out of the comfort zone and the sound design supported the entire package. I dare say that none of those who fell in love to TA have forgotten the first time they heard a Big Bertha fire.Supreme Commander is the natural evolution of that game but in a bigger and more user friendly package. All of the aforementioned features still exist. Units have weight as they turn and massive units don't feel like smaller ones except they are scaled to be larger. If you have an experimental (a very expensive endgame unit) plan its trajectory carefully because you won't be turning on a dime to get it out of danger. The in Forged Alliance is simple, unobtrusive, and effective. The hotkey system leaves a lot of be desired and is quite clumsy but there are mods to fix that into something more elegant if that is you inclination. Individual buildings can be upgraded as can your ACU, which acts as the King and Queen in chess melded into one units. Absurdly powerful but also the victory condition.Perhaps SupCom's greatest innovation is its strategic zoom. One can use to to go from looking at the rivets in a tank to a satellite image of the entire map in a flick of the mousewheel. It cannot be understated the effect this has on gameplay. You can see more, plan more, and execute more complex strategies because of this feature alone.On release this game was far too demanding for most computers and limited its install base. Now I would say almost any decent machine can run in without much issue. It is worth noting that the initial multiplayer client, GPGnet, was discontinued several years ago. What remains are steam's matchmaking infrastructure, which is about as bare-bones as it gets, and the community built client Forged Alliance Forever ( which can be found here: http://www.faforever.com/ ). I strongly recommend FAF as it is still undergoing balance patches, the client is still be developed, and the greater portion of the game's user base resides there.This was a long and rambling review that is mostly clouded by nostalgia and a love for what I believe is the most strategic RTS on the market.TLDR: Recommended			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As far as I am concerned, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is the best RTS game, ever.  Originally Cavedog Entertainment created a game called Total Annihilation.  At the time it was considered the best RTS game, ever.  Chris Taylor later left Cavedog to form his own studio and worked on a spiritual successor to his best-selling TA game.It's hard to describe to today's generation what SupCom was like when it first came out.  It was the first triple-A title that really utilized dual-core (and above) systems;  In an era where you had to force most games to run on a single CPU lest they crash, SupCom adored it, loved it, reveled in it.  It would drive the top-end system into the ground with its rich, lush graphics and absolutely enormous battles.It's also the first game that I can recall which specifically had built-in support for multi-display.  One monitor could show you the ground fight, and on the second monitor you could either have a different camera view or a scaled-up map view.There are too many things to list which were innovated in this game.  Here's a by-no-means exhaustive list:* First game to really show what multi-core computers could do with gigantic 1000+ unit battles.* First pure simulation grand scale RTS, with no RPG-like dice rolls.  If a mega-gun launches a projectile at you, you can dodge it if your unit is fast enough and you are good enough at microing.  Every missile and bullet is simulated when it leaves the barrel.  This made the game a micro-lover's dream.* First game to support multi-monitor, allowing you to configure each display as you want.* First use of a wide-scale camera.  You could zoom all the way out to 30k altitude and view the battle as a series of stategic icons, or zoom all the way in and watch each individual shell land on the enemy.* First use of ""zoom at where I'm looking"" smart camera.  Seriously, I wish more people would utilize this mechanic.  In most RTS games you had to keep your hands on the keyboard at all times despite the game being 90% mouse driven, just so you could move the camera around.  But in SupCom, they made it so when the camera zooms in, it focuses on the point where your cursor is situated.  This makes for an incredibly smooth playing experience, where you feel like you have total control over your view of the battle field.* First RTS where indirect fire is a critical aspect of gameplay.  Most units can actually launch projectiles or shells at least 10% further range or so outside of their radar detection range.  Other units which had wider radar detection ranges could be coupled with indirect-fire units to maximize your effectiveness.  Early scout units were always useful because of this.  SupCom was never a case of ""build unit X until you win"" sort of game, against competent players you had to have a mix.* Innovative resource system inherited from TA which leads to very intense economy management.  Instead of buying units for a fixed cost from a fixed pool of ""money,"" you deal with resources in a producing/consumed sliding scale.  This meant that build order was the king, particularly at the beginning of the game, and you had to be careful with how you spent your resources.  Your factories would never refuse to build a unit if your resource production level was low;  They would just take more and more time.  Conversely, if you over-produced but didn't consume enough, you were likely wasting materials and giving an advantage of the enemy who might not be so frugal.  Because of this, each match is a constant tweaking of your economy.  You had both mass (used for building) and energy (used for powering things) to keep track of.* Wreckage.  Yeah, it's there just to look cool, but it also contains mass which can be reclaimed.  Build a mega-unit and send it to the enemy base and -- oh no, it dies!  Now, not only did you lose your chance, but you've just given the enemy a huge economy boost.  You really had to think about sending in the heavies, as it was possible to give aid to the enemy just by your failures alone.* Stealth mechanic which allowed you to coordinate sneak attacks and all kinds of fun assassin-style missions against the opponent.  One of the three factions is geared towards stealth play.  (Cybrans forever!)* AMAZING control over what your factories and units can do.  Want to have a master factory and 6 others which mirror what it does?  Doable!  Want to have a certain factory to exit a unit and then have it automatically patrol a particular route?  Doable!  Want to edit patrol paths once they are defined?  No problem!  Smart engineer units which automatically assist or reclaim wreckage?  Ayup!* Adjacency economy boosting system.  Factories placed near power sources get a reduction in their power consumption.  But they also get mass-cost reductions when placed near mass sources.  This meant you were always search for the most optimal building configuration to maximize your economy, usually altered by the terrain.* Upgradable commander unit.  SupCom had a single powerful hero unit which could be upgraded via research to give it extra abilities.  Most of these abilities were mutually exclusive, so you had to think about what approach you would take.* Pretty decent single-player campaign that's entertaining and fun to replay as different factions.  It's no Starcraft in that regard but I think it's held up fairly well.* (Sadly no longer applicable.)  Very active eSports community, with frequent and entertaining matches.  Game supports a built-in replay mechanism which allows you to watch matches with ease.* Tons of really awesome mods which expanded the life of the game, such as Sorian AI (which fixed the fairly braindead default AI) and Black Ops (adds a ton of new units).* SupCom:FA adds to the already excellent SupCom by introducing a new single player campaign, new experimental units, all new maps, and a new faction (which admittedly, was kinda broken and way overpowered until the bugs were patched out).Seriously, this game was amazing.  A LOT of thought went into its design and implementation.  SupCom: FA literally ruined all other RTS games for me.  I cannot play them without thinking, ""Gee, I wish I was playing SC:FA instead.""  And then I boot the game up again and take on			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Brace yourself, Operation Meltdown is gonna be a rough one for ya. It sure as hell was for me, and it sure as nuclear hell was for one particular commander in Operation Mind Games.Also, if you suddenly will see lack of ppl in matchmaking, look up Forged Alliance Forever, community-based almost standalone game upgrade with its own hub-lobby-thingie that only requires base game. It can also be pirated, but it must be certain version and as clean as possible, so buying the game is lotsa easier. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some have said that SC crash's and I would more point that at thier system then the game itself. Still, if you find it crash's simply go to google (Who uses bing ;)), search up Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever and download it. It'll fix your crash, as well as give you tounds of new mods and palyers to play with. 12/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The more going on in a map the quicker this happens.-Publisher deadDo check out the mods for this game. There are a lot of them. Many fix balance issues and create better looking explosions.

												Supreme Commander, oh the hours upon hours lost.  The constant stream of tech one bombers from that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI.  That ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moment when an experimental or large army that you were completely unprepared for rolled up.  The ""♥♥♥♥ it"" moment where you build as many nukes as humanly possible as a last ditch effort to win.  The joy of watching this one giant murder bot you spent three and a half hours building completely wipes the floor with your enemy.  I truly love this game, Supreme Commander was way ahead of it's time and I feel it isn't talked about enough.  This is without a doubt in my mind the best RTS I have ever played.  It's scale and memorible factions are amazing and beautiful in ways I honestly can't describe.  I love this game more than any other in my library.  It will always have me coming back for a game or two, assuming I have six hours to kill.  If you like RTS games at all, this is a must have.  This version fo the game is absolute best.  The OG and 2 are good in thier own regrads, but niether has the amazing mods and commuinity.  This game is the main reason I wish there was a double thumbs up option on reviews.  I'd put three.

												TL: DR- 10/10, literally one of the three best strategy games i've ever played, and probably the best RTS.This game can have a steep learning curve, and campaign missions may well take you two hours to complete if you go carefully, or twice that if you go full defensive on the hardest difficulty setting, but this just means that there's actually meaning to good base design, and it is incredibly satisfying to build up an impenetrable fortress then create an army that will flatten your opponent... hopefully. Then there's also the option of building so many nuclear launch facilities that you can overwhelm your enemy's missile defense systems and drown them in nuclear fire (for reference, nukes in this game are just about the hardest to obtain in any game i've found, but they're also the most visually spectacular and you actually have cause to fear them)There is a good variety of options for the skirmish mode, you can put yourself in a cagefight with a trio of AI opponents that cheat just for added difficulty, you can customise some major gamemode settings such as completely disallowing certain units or tech-levels, or you can increase the rate at which everyone gathers resources to speed the game up a bit.The graphics are very nice, especially considering the number if units you will have running around the map at any given time. the textures don't look that great if you were to zoom all the way in, but if you do that you'll zoom out again to find that OH GOD THE CYBRAN HAD A BUNCH OF STEALTHED MONKEYLORDS OUTSIDE MY BASE AND THEY'RE TRAMPLING MY REACTORS!However, the place this game really outshines anything else i've played is its interface. you can customise so easily what the map shows you in terms of the range of your anti-air, anti ground, indirect fire, etc, your sonar, radar, omnisensor ranges... it offers you so much information but if you're finding it overwhelming you can just switch it all of with about two clicks.Unit control is so good in this game, in terms of automation. you can very reasonably set up a factory to produce infinite of a set of units, have air transports pick them up from your base, and airdrop into a different part of the map with no input from the player. this makes managing hundreds (or, with mods, thousands) of units so much eaiser, leaving you to direct your army, navy and airforce, and watch the explosions.

Just a heads up, this is my first review so I apologize in advance for any suckyness. Also I have played much more off of steam. Also this goes for both games.       The best game ""ever"" is a very hotly disputed subject. Most people say it's WOW, or Halo, or CS go, or COD, or Shadow of the Collosus, or some other game with a big fandom. All things considered, I say this one, because I truly believe it has (almost) every aspect of the ideal, at least strategy, game.Great Interface  Immersive storyline                     Balanced units                             Unique factions                            Many viable strategy optionsGreat replayability                       Amazing Graphicsexcellent Multiplayer and LAN gameplayHUGE unit captons of units to chose fromTruly epic mapslotsa modsStunning (and realistic) scale (the smallest units are twice as tall as a truck and the biggest are about 1000 times larger) If you havn't lost interest thus far I would love to go into details.There are only two resources in the game, mass and energy, both ar equally important and are used to build everything in the game. mass is gathered primarily from ""mass deposits"" on which you build ""mass extractors"". Energy is gathered by building generators. Both are used in about equal amounts if you go by values as opposed to numbers. One of the most interesting parts of Supreme Commander is that its resource system is ""active"". In other words, you don't save up to buy something, then have it instantly reducted from your total when you buy something. Instead, the resources are gradually  pumped into a unit as you produce it. In short, how much you have stored up doesn't really matter, what does matter is how quickly you are getting it. Personally, I like this system a lot and find it more realistic.    There are five basic unit categories in the game. ACU: The Armored Command Unit, it is the only unit you start out with. It can build stuff, shoot stuff, and upgrade itself. The best part? If it dies it explodes with the force of a hydrogen bomb :)Engineers: build stuff, make factories build faster, and can ""hack"" enemy units and buildings.Land units: kills stuff on landAir Units: transports land units and kills stuff just about everywhereNaval Units: are more powerful (and expensive) that the other types of units, and, you guessed it, they kill stuff on (and under) the water There are a TON of different buildings to make so I wont go into too much detail. There are land, air, and naval factories, loads of turrets for different purposes, artillery, and intel structures, as well as advanced structures and assorted resource-related stuff. There are three main tech levels. Basically, when you build a factory of any sort, you can build engineers (and of course military units) from it. you can upgrade the factory to the next tech level at any time and get access to new units and better engineers, with access to more advanced buildings. The only individual units which can be upgraded are your ACU and some other buildings. PS. There are also MASSIVE experimental units for each faction, each with the power of an entire lesser army. thay are built like buildings and many include these as tech 4, but I cant help but think of them as seperate.There are four factions in the game, each with its own appeal and advantages.UEF:  The United Earth Federation, the humany humans of the game, mechs, bullets, and tanks. They are pretty good at rushes and tend to have more in the way of armor and heavy assault units and less in the way of shields. Cybran: I really feel for these guys. In short, they're oppressed humans with cybernetic implants who want to free their bretheran from forced obedience programs. They are the undisputed masters of cloaking and stealth technology, and are optimised for surprise attacks. Aeon: the classic humans-with-alien-tech-who-are-quasi-religous. lots of lasers, powerful shields, and plenty of hover tanks *cough* Vanu *cough*. Their main thing is ""every unit must be as good as possible at its given duty and not be able to do anything else"". no filthy multi-tasking in the illuminate. This really comes out in their units and is favored by a lot of people.And last but certainly not least (don't tick them off they blew up earth) THE SERAPHIM. Long story short, we nuked them on first contact (smart humans, seriously more should do that) they dissapproved of that for some reason and promptly alien-nuked us back, and so on and so forth. They don't seem to have an over-arching unit style, but thay are very good at turtling (great AA, good artillery, and best shields in the game). Their tech is sort of Enders game's Formics meet Halo's covenant.All in all, an amazing game, 9/10, honestly the only thing that could make it better would be a map editor. If you're reading this it means you read to the end of my review and have made it all worth it.      ",16,2,0,4,5,0,12

												This is very good game and it is very unique.Also despite the fact that the game released long time ago, it is still very interesting.You will definitely like this game in two cases:1. StarCraft 2 is too fast for you and you prefer to use tactics instead of ""Actions Per Minute"" skill.2. You like the game ""Wargame"" (or similar games) but you don't like a lack of possibility to construct buildings and gather resources.This game is much slower than StarCraft, have much larger scales but also allows to construct bases. So you probably will like it.Also, not anyone knows, but the game still have strong community and you can easily find a game to play PvP up to 4x4 or even 6x6 players.Community of this game created a service for multiplayer, you may find details here: faforever.comYou can found some video of PvP on Youtube and you will note that the game is very tactical.Another interesting fact, at first glance you may think that most units of all 4 factions is similar.But actually they have very different characteristics. You may found units database on the website above and explore how to use different advantages or disadvantages of different units and factions.Also, if you played Planetary Annihilation (which is similar to this game), take a note that Supreme Commander have a lot of features which is not available in PA, such as: - Shields - Large air transport - Better aviation - Mods with a lot of new unitsSo I recommend you to check this game.

												THQ up to its old tricks again with the spiritual successor to Total Annihalation; Sup Com 1 and Sup Com Forged Alliance are not to be avoided; however Sup Com 2 is to be avoided like the plague. (Dumbed down for the teen market - giant robo t rex with lasers coming out of eyes ffs). When this first came out no one could play it as hardware was not there for the most part; these days though a decent rig will enable you to experience 4v4 with a 1000 unit population cap per player no probs. The economy is identical to Total Annihalation; mass and energy are the only resources you need, the armoured command unit (ACU) is as ever the engine by which you drive your war machine, and units now come in four distinct flavours: tech 1, tech 2, tech 3 and experi(mental) on land, sea and by air. Also the maps range from 5km sq to 96km sq so there is something for everyone in terms of scale; you might like land only maps which are barely large enough to swing a cat, or you may enjoy a naval map the size of a small country. And despite its age it is one of the more aesthetically pleasing games ever produced and still has a large online following on steam. Buy it as it should be pretty cheap these days, but remeber do not touch Sup Com 2, just Sup Com and Sup Com forged alliance please!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely and utterly the best RTS game you can get. The hours recorded in steam does not reflect the time i have spent in this game. I mostly played on GPGnet, but since its demise all players now use FAF - forged alliance forever, a community of dedicated players reaching at times up to 1000 players on at any given moment. FAF has player rating for balanced games, 1v1 ladder, and custom games. The game within FAF has been modified to rebalance the game further, whilst this is work in progress, major alterations have taken place to improve gameplay for the better. The game features what i consider a must for any large scale RTS which is called Zoom. This means you can seamlessly zoom in and out of areas of the map that need your attention. Fixed view with minimap is no use at all for this scale of game where you control 100's of units.The game is difficult i wont lie. Its made harder by the fact that dedicated players like myself have played the game for a long time and know it inside out, but we are here to help new players learn, and this is where FAF plays a great role in introducing and helping new players by offering video tutorials and a community lobby where people can chat in public and private messages.The game features a flux economy system. This in my opinion is fantastic, you accumulate resources per second, and spend resources per second. Each structure or unit costs resources per second, and the time in which it takes for something to complete can be decreased if you have enough resources by channeling more build power into the particular unit or structure. This adds a dimension of strategy to the already obundant strategies available in game.You have 2 resources, mass and energy. Mass is mostly made from building an extractor on fixed locations throughout the map forcing the player to expand, energy is made by making structures that produce it. You can enhance your mass production by upgrading the mass exctractors that you have built. Doing so will cost you mass and energy but you will be rewarded on completion with more mass per second. Finding the balance between spending resources and increasing them either makes you win or lose the game. It is extremely hard to find that balance especially when you play different maps.Each game is its own, it feels different, because there are so many variables within a game, choices that you make or decisions that your oponents make. Playing the same map over and over will not bring you boredom, instead you will retain the interest and hunger for the win, cahnge your style, adapt your choices.Like any RTS you are encouraged to expand, and rewarded with resources for doing so but what makes FAF so diverse is the map selection. Gameplay can vary extensively based on the type of map you are playing, so for those of you who are new to the game or prefer not to move to much, there are maps that cater for that play style. We call them turtle maps, where resources are located near to your start location minimizing any early raids so you can focus entirely on a smaller number of tasks.Actions per minute do matter in this game, there are many things to do, early on you have less units and less things to monitor, its nice and relaxed, but as the game lengthens you are forced to do more as your units multiply, it becomes more challenging and it begins to become much more intense. A replay feature which can be watched at any point will show you your mistakes or how you won, its a great way to learn.There are 4 tech tiersTech 1 - basic units that you can build right away, low heatlth and damage but low cost.Tech 2 - higher health more versatile, better selection, costs a little moreTech 3 - high health and damage, costs alotExperimantal - Collosal units with very high health and damage, game changers, slow to build, cost a lotCertain maps enable games as big as 8v8, games can last as little as 7 minutes or as long as 2 hours depending on how balanced or aggressive the teams are. The rating system is based on trueskill, new player ratings will fluctuate greatly to begin with until it works out how well you play.As you might already know the game features base building, engineers are a unit you have to build to make structures, you can have 1 engineer make a building in 3 minutes or 10 engineers make it 10 times faster, but it will cost ten times more per second. Structures you can make are land factories, naval factories, air factories. Point defense building to defend with, tactical long range missile launchers, tactical missile defense, nukes and anti nukes, stationary shields, or even giant artillary that can reach the entire map.There are 4 factions at the moment, each faction is diverse, it feels different and has different buildings and units with different stats. You start the game with one unit, the Commander, which can be upgraded, it can build structures and fight against units. Your commander is on of your most formible units which can be useful both passively and aggressively. If he dies, you die so you need to keep him alive at all costs.I have probly played this game more than 10000 hours in the 7 years i have owned it, i still play it most days even now. Please if you are an RTS fan give this a try, dont be put off by its difficulty, it can be frustrating at 1st but it is so rewarding when you start winning. Good luck commanders			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, I don't ever play this game through steam, but probably have upwards of 700 - 1000 hours ingame.So. I'm going to assume you know what this game is. I just checked the release date of the game.It was 2007.2007TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN.That was when the last CIV4 expansion was released.And the game still looks amazing - my computer couldn't even run it until 3/4 years ago.Is this game worth buyign still then? Yes, definitely, theres still a very strong, friendly community playing it online, using Forged Alliance Forever (look it up), and they've taken over patching and updating the game with new features.Most importantly, its better than any other real time strategy game I have played since.Since 2007.

												One hard strategy game with quite a few things going on.  Quite a bit different (and more challenging and rewarding IMO) than starcraft or Age of Empires or even Planetary Annihilation.  Quite an impressive feat considering when Forged Alliance game came out. This game is going to be alive for a while until another Supreme Commander comes out that pleases all of the fans.  Most prefer this one over Supreme Commander 2. Be sure to look up Forged Alliance forever if you get this game.  It will help you with matches, watching replays of other players and other things.

												Good RTS, but a bit to hard core for my old age. I like to take the time to build up a base and slowly and strategically expand territory. But even on easy AI difficulty you are soon swarmed by enemies on your base. The game is really about capturing the resource points faster than the enemy otherwise you are screwed. The game mechanics, graphics, UI and everything is just fine for such an old game. I like the game a lot, besides from getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked on easy mode :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a masterpiece it is a base building RTS  based in a future where the galaxy has been torn apart by a millenia of war by 3 factions:United Earth Federation Cybrans Aeon eahc being different and unique this game also has a unique unit system where u start with ur ''commander'' who builds structures for u and can defeat low level enemy units and ur commander can be upgraded to be improved in combat or have access to higher level structures u can also build enginers a=however ur commander can build quicker there are 3 technically 4 tiers in the game and are defined as ''tech'' u will start at Tech 1 and u get to higher techs by building factories of the previous tech eg once u have a T1 factory u can upgrade it to T2 then T3 each tech allows access to more advanced structures and units once u get T3 engineers or upgrade ur commander to T3 u can get ''experimntals'' which are the most powerful units in the game they are expensive and have high health and damageThe campaign takes place during the ''infinite war'' as the wars combatants have nicknamed it due to it's long period of fighting however when an alien race appears called the ''Seraphim'' the 3 factions UEF Cybrans and Aeon are forced to make a temporary cease fire and stand together to fight the Seraphim threat the campaign features 7 missions I believe each challenging with interesting objectives and characters uuuu can unfortunately not play as the Seraphim but can choose a commander from one of the 3 allied factions The combat section of the game is phenomonal however battles can last too long these can be multiplayer in the campaign or the multiplayer the combat even though can last too long is great battles are intense and massive and requires strategy and constant attention matches rarely get boring Pros: Brilliant gameplay Unique mechanics Hard campaignInteresting charactersGreat story Large battlesIntense gameplayWell balancedCons:Battles can drag on too long Some units build too slowlyCampaign can get too difficult at timesIn the end the game is a masterpiece if I gave it a rating it would be a strong 9/10 it is unfortunately held back by ridiculous difficulty spikes and battles dragging on for literally hours but I would highly reccommend this game to anyone who like the genre.

												A grand expansion for quite possibly the grandest strategy game ever made. If you are looking for massive battles across land, see, and air with giant experimental units towering over hundreds of tanks and explosions, look no further. If Total Annihilation was the masterpiece that made Grand Real Time Strategy a genre, Supreme Commander is the pinnacle of said genre.It is a beast to run even in 2016, but the incredible experiences possible make it completely worth it. You'll want to grab the community lobby at http://faforever.com to play mods, get the latest balance patches, and use matchmaking, as the steam version is a very dumbed down lobby list.The game does support a zoom level allowing you to see the entire map at once, but you'll want to zoom in to see your armies crushing the enemy into certain defeat.... until you realize that they've been saving up for a nuke and you better hide your Commander unit before it explodes and victory slips from your grasp.I've played the game since launch and consider Forged Alliance an essential companion to the original masterpiece. Once again, the campaign is filled with cliches and medicore writing, but it's better than the base game's campaign, and is a great prep for playing online with others.Perfect 5/7 duck-sized horses or 10/10 fake internet video game points.

												Hands down my favorite RTS by far. Playerbase remains active (mostly on FAF, but Steam has a bit of activity as well) and is generally friendly and helpful. Learning curve is a bit steep, but then again, the learning curve for a good RTS SHOULD be steep. Highly recommended to any fan of the genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a long time RTS fan and I used to play total annhilation years ago. I bought this game a while back on steam after getting bored of single player on my discs. This is an incredible game and for 2007, the graphics are ridiculously good. I have been reading the negative comments and the majority state ""Game won't work"" or ""It Won't start."" After about 130 hours of playing my copy, my game broke like many other have done. However it is a quick fix. Don't spend hours looking for another way, just download the Forged Alliance Forever Client.Forged Alliance Forever is a community driven project and is a great plays to play games. There are mod vaults, map vaults, ladder mathes, tournaments and even tutorials for the new players. I have played on this for at least another 200 hours since my steam copy stopped working.I hope everyone has found this helpful!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/10 I LOVE this game. It is a classic I will play for a life time.That said, I can't believe what tragedy Supreme Commander 2 was. How the hell could they have screwed up so bad??? I mean FFS. Were they trying to get the children who had the same I.Q as a monkey to play??? Keep it complex. Keep it strategy oriented. and you will have my money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A truely unique RTS game, which stands out as a great game for local area multiplayer. The single player campaign is all right, but pretty forgettable. I've spend hours playing this game with my friends and I never played a RTS that allowed players to become pretty decent after just a few matches. This is true due to an emphasis on overall strategy as opposed to apm like it is the case in the StarCraft series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Want to Fight everything across the huge map? No problem. Want a large sea battles that only few RTSes can do it? No problem. Do you want a large explosions? no problem.But gotta say. This game is very CPU intensive. You need a very good CPU. Not more cores, but better single core performance because this game is very old and not support multicore CPUs.

												An excellent RTS game with a remarkable amount of thought and care put into it, one can tell that the developers truely loved the game they were making, and that level of care, meticulous attention to detail, and authenticity is hard to find in modern AAA games like starcraft.Supcom effortlessly joins relatively simple concepts such as mass extraction and energy generation with tiered technology and layered complexity to create a game that at no point seems overwhelming, but always keeps the player engaged. I cant remember any time in the game I felt like I was coasting, or I had nothing to do, as the tremendously effective AI always keeps you on your toes, and whether you are a new player, or a veteran, there's a difficulty for you. I also can't say there was any time, save perhaps one instance, where I rage quitted. Supreme Commander is one of thos games where losing is just as fun and spectacular as winning. Hearing that STRATEGIC LAUNCH DETECTED, or seeing an experimental bomber bearing down on your base are the kinds of twists and turns in the game that level designers would work to make by hand, Supcom acheives them on a regular basis just by operating within its own well implemented rules. 100/10, if you don't buy this game you're kind of stupid.

												This is the ultimate strategy game. Basebuilding and economy are a huge factor in this game and the default game with expansion has a large amount of units per each faction. Want to turtle up your base and nuke/artillery your enemy into the dust? You can do that. Want to build up a quick and fast army to rush your enemies before they've prepared? No problem. Want to play a game that can easily take 4+ hours and will test how well you can really handle stressful situations? This is the game for you. Seriously I don't know how this game never became an Esport, I guess it was just made before Esports really kicked off. And with any game, mods can only stand to make it better. I personally use a mod called Total Mayhem which adds in entirely new experimental units, for each tier, and has rekindled my love for this game. It's a shame it never the sequel it deserved.

												Released in 2007 or not, this is still the best large scale RTS game out there.

The UI is soooo much better than Supreme Commander, but the gameplay is basicaly the same, with a lot of new units and a new faction and a way harsher campaign. The only RTS game where I didn't feel restrained by the game but instead helped by it. Lots of UI details allow you to set up complex strategies with little effort other than thinking those strategies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First experience:Played the 1st campaign, didn't find tech upgrade buttons, built loads of T1 AA. The raining wrecks of hundreds of enemy aricrafts eventually destroyed my shield.Long time experience:Seriously one of the best RTS games ever made, it feels epic when dodging bomber shells with you commander while requesting air support from your friends. It even feels awesome while losing, trying to build up a turtle defense as hard as possible to make you enemy work more for victory.I can only recommend installing the FAF lobby mod, most people are playing multiplayer there. It even has ranking system and auto-matches, a coop-campaign, 6v6 and a lot of awesome maps & mods integrated.And its dirt cheap during any sale, and still cheap without sale. You need a good CPU though if you want to experience the BIG fights that this game can and will deliver... This game did to me in the RTS genre what Planetside 2 did in the shooter genre: Deliver a vast amount of memorable experiences and challenges on a scale that other games just cannot compete with.

												The best real time strategy game I have played. I love the strategic zoom function and there is a huge array of units to build. For Epic battles nothing but supreme commander will do. If you choose to buy the game get this one (not supreme commander 2 which gutted the game of the strategic depth) and make sure you get the forged alliance expansion which introduces more maps and units. Also most of the online players will be using Forged alliance.Bottom line: This is a fantastic strategic experience that is unique to this game. There is a big learning curve before you can hold your own online but it is totally worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Freaking Amazing game. The new one(SC2) is complete crap, but this one is amazing.You can have up 1000 units per 8 teams, fighting some massive war. Huge number of units possible to build on each team. You can also mod it, so its 3x better at any time. The missions are great too, fun, not slow, and forces you to adapt.The greatest experience in an RTS you will ever have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game I have bought very recently and it has not been found wanting. I was introduced to the SupCom franchise via Youtube after incidentally coming across Supcom 2 fanmade epic gameplay vids. A month later I bought Supcom 2.It has been many years since then and I have always heard or read reviews of how Supcom 2 (which in my mind was a decent RTS) had failed to meet the high expectations of loyal fans from Supcom and Supcom FA. My curiosity urged me to discover a little more about this antique and not too long ago, I happened across a steam sale where the bundle pack was sold for 5 SGD (3.45 USD).In a short timeframe, I have spent many hours into this game and it has left me astounded that such a relic has not been properly glorified. In other words, this game had happened upon us too early for its time. Rarely do we ever come across such a priceless bundle of packaged joy (at such a steal too!).It had been frustrating but incredibly worth it when I first started this game. My base was constantly getting wrecked by early T1 units simply because I made the noob mistake of jumping to T2 at the start. Eco management in this game is incredibly different from SupCom 2 and when handled improperly, would cost you the game. I only learned about 'ghetto gunships' a week ago and had so much fun pounding enemy bases with 28 mech marines per T3 transports. There are really very little restrictions when playing this game and it forces players to abuse as much of the unit abilities as possible. Hell Starcraft 2 did not have this type of complexity when it comes to eco. (or unit management)To my fellow RTS gamers out there that are still deciding to buy this antique, give this a shot and you might be pleasently surprised at how complex this game can be.glhf			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is hands down the best RTS game that I have ever played. Large scale battles with thousands of units under the command of 2-8 players (12 on some custom made maps). Many maps ranging from 5 square kilometers, all the way up to 81 square kilometers - just shy of 50 square miles! - and yes, they really do feel that large.Pros:This game is tons of fun whether you're playing alone or with family and friendsPlaying alone is great; playing with friends is pure awesomeness.Very high attention to even some of the smallest details.There are tons of moving parts. If you go up close, you can see all the tank treads spinning, as well as multiple parts of legs making coreographed motions to create movement.If a unit has more than one weapon, each weapon will by physically present on the unit, and each projectile will appear different.If there is a unit that has a passive ability, for example shielding, or radar jamming, you will see that there is a physical part on the unit that creates this effect. What's better is that it will even resemble the actual building structures that use the same effects, to a certain degree.One of my favorite examples of the above is the Cyrbran Tech 2 Tactical Missile Defense structure and the Cybran Tech 3 Siege Assault Bot. The T3 Bot has it's own personal Tactical Missile Defense system, and looking at the left shoulder will show a similar structure on it (in this case a shpere on a pillar). It even functions by shooting a small red laser at Tactical Missiles, returning them to sender!Truly massive scale battles.Up to 8 teams with up to 1,000 units/structures per team, or up to 8,000 in one game, all at the same time. This unit cap can be increased to 2,000 per team and 16,000 in one game with the Lobby Enhancement Mod. Further more, custom made maps can also increase the number of players to a maximum of 12, making the maximum unit/structure count go to a whopping 24,000! 4 factions with similar yet unique units and buildingsMany units, while similar to one another, can vary so wildyl in combat that they can serve completely different purposes.One example is the UEF and Cybran battleships. The UEF  battleship's main armaments consist of 3 turrets with 3 cannons per turret. It fires all three cannons per turret at the same time, dealing massive damage. The Cybran battleship's main armaments consist of 2 turrets with 3 cannons per turret. However, it fires only one cannon per turret, resulting in much lower damage, in exchange for much higher rate of fire. Strong community and many modsThere is still quite a big following playing this game even today. You can find this community on the Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) servers. If I'm not mistaken, downloading the Forged Alliance Forever app will also give you the Sourian AI mod as well as the Lobby Enhancement Mod. Personally, I wouldn't skip these two mods for this game, especially the AI mod if you like to play against computers.One of my absolute favorite features of FAF is the ability to play the campaign in co-op mode with friends. There are pletny of games being played every day from many players with ranging skill levels. You'll find tournaments and just for fun games alike. You'll also find a nice hand full of custom made maps you can download directly from the Vault in the FAF app.Cons:The unit movement can get a little annoying at timesSometimes they'll get stuck or confused trying to walk around one another, and it can be frustrating, though I find this generally not to be much of an issue.The campaign is just okay.You are never forced to try harder to win; you can simply just test yourself on how fast you can do it. You can simply take your time to build up your army before advancing to the next checkpoint.Playing co-op completely changes the experience for me. I guess I just like playing with friends and family.This game is highly CPU intensive.Older and lower tier CPUs simply cannot handle this game on it's maximum scale. Towards the end of matches, and especially longer ones against the computers, you will notice massive slow down in game play. The Sourian AI mod, while also more fun due to being more of a challenge, alleiviates a lot of this issue when compared to standar AI that was programmed into the game. The standard computers tend to build tons, and tons of units and leave them at the base for long periods of time, resulting in less fun, and more CPU usage which results in slower gameplay.For example, an older rig I used with an AMD FX-6300 played the game just fine with 7 standard AIs, up until the end of the game where it was practically grinding to a halt. It was unplayably slow; roughly 3-4 real time seconds per game second. Now I'm using an Intel i7 4790k with the 7 Sourian AIs and I can easily play games well past the 2 hour mark with 0 slow down, with some head room to spare.All in all, this game is an absolute blast to play! One of my favorite games that I own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I bought Supreme Commander I was looking for a game that would compare to my ultimate favourite, Total Annihilation. The two are practically the same concept wise, armies of gigantic robots do battle on a massive scale, but TA is a tough act to follow.I have to say though that Supreme Commander is almost exactly what i wanted and there is only one negative for me. There are a staggering array of unit options for various battle roles, Awesome! However I miss the choice of defensive turrets with only one type of point defense and one anti air defense per tech level.Other than that this game is almost flawless. Hard to believe it is such an old game! It is however very challenging, normal AI will often decimate you in a matter of minutes unless you start your game strongly, the tougher AI are almost godlike in their abilities and take some real skills to defeat. Overall tis is a top, top game and definately a worthy successor to the Legend that was Total Annihilation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't usually write reviews, but Im willing to make an exception in this case. There simply aren't too many reasons not to like supcom fa. In other legendary RTS games, battles are made in rock paper scissors-style. Spears defeat cavalry, cavalry archers and archers spears. And of course, upgraded units defeat weaker ones. In the background economy plays a big role. Thats ok, but it lacks deep multidimensional strategy that supcom offers. Battles are fought in underwater, groundlevel and air simultaneusly. Instead of dealing less damage to sub-optimal enemies, units have limited capability where they can operate. For example, cannons cant kill submarines and AA-guns are required to kill aircraft. This itself requires more thinking than just normal RTS. Most of the guns can shoot longer than they can see, so radar and scouting is required to utilize units full capasity. Game offers excellent radar and intel system, which ads even more to the strategy aspect. And when you you think this cant get any more complicated, game introduces intelligent missiles and missile defenses, energy shields, nuclear weaponry, EMP weapons and much, much more. In the background, your economy produces units instead of just buying them unlike any other RTS.When you read negative comments of this game, you will notice two kind of players.1.""My potato wasn't able to run this game, so it must suck""2.Players with less than 10 hours of playtime. They usually just say it sucks instead of accepting the fact that they just suck at it.			",35,3,0,4,5,0,9

												Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is a continuation of the Supreme Commander formula of giant map and truly insane amounts of units doing battle across ground, land and air. It does have some problems however, especially if you like me prefer single-player.Forged Alliance has no progression of tech unlike the original, you start with everything unlocked and more often than not a base already built and for a single-player experience that is a great offense because it removes half of the gameplay from the equation and often just leaves you with spamming units at the enemy.While many parts of the game has been improved in Forged Alliance the lackluster single-player experience leaves me with a bitter taste and little interest in continuing my adventure and that's a shame because the Supreme Commander formula of scale beyond anything RTS gamers have seen in a long time is something I really enjoyed.

												A must have for anyone interesting in a Real time strategy game, new or experienced.Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is probably the shinest gem out there that still blows all the other next generation RTS games by this day. It has nearly everything that an RTS must have, the necessities and unique features, such as faction diversity, adjacency bonuses, and mod support as well. It may seem complicated at first, but you get used to it pretty fast, as it is easy to learn.The community is still alive and working here, usually hanging on the Forged Alliance Forever lobby mod, which optimizes the game further and adds working multiplayer lobbies, ranked matchmaking, and so forth.Each unit from each faction serves a vital role in your great conquest across the the entire battlefield, lots of diversity into them as well.Resources is a pretty interesting one, unique but sometimes frustrating if you don't know your build orders. I highly recommend this game.			",40,0,0,1,4,0,11

												This game is the single best strategy game i have ever played, if you like fairly complicated start games thenn this game is for you but i do not recommend getting it off Steam  and get it off {LINK REMOVED} for a measly £3.90 or something along hose lines. the sheer amount of units in this game makes it the most diverse RTS game ive ever played, the amount of units and different buildings makes for a sick game. if you are new to startegy games then i don't really recommend this game due to the size of it and how complex it can get if you are playing against people who are actually good at the game. the games on this game can last up to 2 and a half hours. there is a 3rd party app for this game called FAF (Forged Alliance Forever) which is where most of the Forged Alliance community is based but there are still a few people that play the normal version. this game is very easy to run i can tell you this because i get 60fps and my pc is not very good at all. i would give this game a 9/10 and the only reason its not a 10 is because it is not very new player freindly and throws you into a massive battle at the start of the campaign and not telling you really what to do. Brilliant game overall :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An underappreciated real-time strategy game way ahead of it's time. Truly a masterpiece - 10/10I've yet to see another real-time strategy game that captures the scale, and sheer awesomeness of the battles in Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. Battles span across sprawling landscapes, massive seas, and in the air. You play the role of a supreme commander, commanding your army from a giant battle mecha armor called an Armored Command Unit (ACU), a customizable, badass one-man army of it's own, highly capable of both fighting and building structures to support your economy and to produce forces. From this literal war machine, you will be commanding hundreds of units at a time, and if the battles go on too long, you'll gain the technology to produce game-ending experimental super weapons, ranging from massive motherships,  untouchable orbital lasers, sacred assault bots, to experimental resource generators or experimental nuclear missiles capable of wiping out significant portions of the map. Since the scale of the combat is so vast, and the realistic fluidity of unit movement makes precise micromanagement impossible, you will be mostly focused on unit composition and macro-management of resources, expansions, and factories. The economy in this game is income based, so this means you will never need to worry about running out of resources, but you need to make sure you're not overspending your income, or production will slow down significantly. You can also stockpile resources if you have adequate storage.  This means you may, however, overspend if you have a significant amount of resources stockpiled. This allows you to surge production when you need to, to fend off a vicious assault, or to build a high-cost experimental weapon. In short, this is a must play game for RTS fans looking for epic, slower-paced, strategy-heavy combat.P.S. If you have this game, I highly recommend you augment it with the Forged Alliance Forever mod+client. It provides a very active online community, a platform to host games and play online games, and a rebalancing of game mechanics. I use this excusively when playing, this is why my play time recorded on Steam is so low, I actually easily have hundreds of hours in this game.			",123,26,4,13,12,1,22

												Owned the game for a long time, decided to buy it on Steam some time ago, a very good decision!Beautiful graphics, the shield rendering, explosions, and bullet rains all over the place!The stock AI is kinda dumb tough, take the Sorian AI mod, and the game becomes much better, very challenging!Just a shame it's badly programmed... even on top-notch I7's (3610QM & 4700MQ, no extreme overclocked sh**) it causes a pretty heavy load (Full load on 2 cores often), and when playing with a lot of AI's the game can even freeze up. I have no idea how anyone would play this with a 1.8 Ghz processor, which the requirements state.... Probably only possible with a resolution of 320x240.Also the requirements state like ""1 GB RAM"", well even with 8 GB RAM you still can run into low memory warnings, which is a bug, because there is always 2GB+ RAM still free... it seems this is much more likely to happen when having a resolution of 1920x1080, because I suppose the game has to allocate more memory for the bigger textures.Whenever you get these low memory warnings, at any given moment your game could just crash, it can mess up your desktop. Meaning you have to reboot your computer by force. (Or if you are not the average person, open up the CMD blindly, and kill the process)But with some tools like Core Maximizer and Large Address Aware the game runs a lot better.Multiplayer is very nice in this game, no annoying lag, and there are enough configuration options for all the maps.Maybe i've said some bad things about this game in the review, but it's definitely worth the money! No doubt!!!You will love this game, Skirmish mode rocks.When talking about ratings, I would say this I guess...Gameplay 9/10 No real glitchy behavior, factions all have good units, each with their own unique strenghtsGraphics 8/10 Very good graphics, especially for it's time, turn on Bloom, and the game looks much better, or download shaders. Of course we're not comparing this to games from 2014.Audio 9/10 Nice sound effects, like the artillary cannons, or from experimentalsPerformance 6/10 Like I said, you need a pretty fancy computer to run this game, with ATLEAST medium graphics, and a resolution bigger than 800x600, a 1.8 Ghz CPU and GPU with 128 MB VRAM ain't going to do the job.Use the tools provided by the community to make the game run much smoother!

												It's a shame that almost no current RTS games could come close to how good this game is. Massively scaled at 2000 unitcap. You would usually expect to see hundreds of units pitting against each other in a single battle. Comes with a huge variety of units\buildings to boot. Ranging from Tech1, 2, 3 and finally experimental. Each faction (out of 4) are completely different from each other, be it units or buildings. You pick the faction that suits your play style the most. It's in depth as there are countless of possible strategies that you can come up with. Be it spamming a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of T1 units to swarm your opponent, overpower them with higher tech, or you could even just turtle all the way to victory via nukes and artillery. You wont expect the 'typical RTS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t' point system where you have 'unlock' certain units\function\blabla. *Ahem* RedAlert3. No, every game is fully fledged, you play the game how you want it to be without lame limitations. And oh yeah, air units here have fuel.There's plenty to talk about how good this game is, but then it would defeat the purpose of actually getting the game and enjoying it first hand. By yourself.

												Where to start? Supreme Commander is in one word: MASSIVE. You can set a cap of 8000 units on the battlefield, so if you have a 1v1, each player can have 4000 units. FOUR-F******-THOUSAND. At 8 players (teams don't have to be fair) each player has a thousand troops. I have seen people compare this game to Starcraft with 200 units at the max per player. Some people like the extreme tactics that game has, this game has them too, except on a bigger scale. Let me show you a quick comparisonAirdrops: Starcaft: Drop 16 marines in 2 medivacs.Supreme Commader: Drop 20 units in 1 transport.ArmiesStarcraft: A marine/marauder deathball slaughtering zerglings or a zealot rushSupreme Commander: A 300 strong army supported by experimentals holds off the main force, as battleships and carriers support the army, then on the over side of the map 5 nuclear subs nuke the enemy base as an airdrop composed of 150 units flanks the main force. (And that is on a 1000 units per team)Nukes: (I know that it's only a lesser part of Starcraft, but it is quite big in the end game of Supreme Commander)Starcraft: A Nuke won't destroy the main base building, it's mainly for clearing armies or finishing off basesSupreme Commander: When you usually send nukes, you send 5 or more. Depending on nuke defences the attack might fail but when it hits, it hits. A nuke will wipe a base.DefenceStarcraft: SC is about the offensive and manuevering, you defend to hold the army off as a bigger force flanks.Supreme Commander: If you have ever played Halo Reach, on the desert mission where you need to destroy the AA towers, at the end there is a massive Spire. Imagine that but around the spire there is about 50 gatling guns and AA turrets. Also (most games don't have this) you CAN build WALLS. (I know it's amazing)While I personally like this feature of this game, some peope disagree. There are NO hard counters. (Well yes, the tech 2  UEF flak turret tank will easily  wipe out tech 2 planes and even take on tech 3 planes. And yes, the experimentals are basically hard counters for everything they can target, and the air vs air planes will SLAUGHTER EVERYONE WHO FLIES.) But mostly a tech 3 robot will not have an advantage over a tech 3 tank or vise verca.  And although all the factions look different and have different units, they are mostly the same. The main differences are: some factions unlock different units earlier. eg the Aeon unlock have a tech 1 attack boat. And the experimentals; each faction has 3 or 4 different experimental units.  The graphics are not Starcraft level, but they are still REALLY good.I would reccomend getting Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance and ""Forged Alliance Forever"".A free community hub for SC: Forged Alliance, it includes ""The Vault"" from where you can download custom maps and mods (All free). And it is only place for online play. The campaign is really solid and stands on its feet, but the main focus is on multiplayer.There really is no game to compare this to. It is a RTS, it is not a 4X RTS. Yet it's more than a normal RTS. I would call it a quarter of its way to a 4X RTS. The game is really easy to get into, but it's a lot like Starcraft where you need to spend time playing it to get good. On a last note: you play other games to feel like you command an army or a small force. You play this game to feel like you command you command EVERYTHING. Much like the Emperor in 40K. Remember to get Forged Alliance Forever. Also don't get Supreme Commander 2, it sucks Also UEF for the win.			",104,11,1,17,15,1,37

												SupCom is war on a huge scale, a game where powerful death machines are capable of wiping out hundreds of units before they are brought to their knees and maps are measured in tens of kilometres.  Automation and specialised units let you plan outlandish offensives involving multiple coordinated strikes.It's not easy to figure out the economy but if you stick with it I promise you'll love it.  If you can't figure out how to balance your economy or need prettier graphics give SupCom 2 a try.  It loses some of the charm but is a lot easier to learn how to play.			",234,43,5,41,38,2,62

												This is the best. Do not tell me about the others, for this one is the best. In no other game I have seen can you build a sprawling military complex, and then build several military complexes each with specific functions. I have built naval bases, radar stations, listening points, walls, artillary bastions and air bases cloaked from radar. I have sent vast fleets to patrol the oceans, I have made refueling stations where spy planes and bombers alike refuel within sight of a walled complex humming with fifty power generators. I have rolled out tanks and bots in intricate military formations and panned the camera down to see my army rumble over hills, kicking up dirt and barging through forests. I have launched nukes and razed my enemies with gunships the size of mountains.What I have NOT done is endure a measly RTS where you and your opponent start at opposite ends of a tiny map, build one land factory, one mine and two guard towers, and race to get the super unit. Forged Alliance doesn't do that. Forged Alliance treats you like a general, not a MOBA player.			",36,3,0,8,14,0,14

												This game is the standalone expansion of the original supreme commander. nevertheless it plays the same, and we wouldn't have it any other way. In supreme commander you don't just fight a battle, you create an entire war zone. Supreme commander focuses on ALL aspects of war; naval, air, land, radar, transports, defense turrets, resource production and managment, adaptation, vetranacity, nukes, nuke submarines (ftw), even shields and anti nukes not to mention the experimental units (extreme game changers). This game takes strategy to a whole new level with different factions and different units. The game itself wven gives you a menu to mod it, and the mods for this game are outstanding. But this is definatley a game for more experienced players, for those who are new or just getting into these games i would suggest supreme commander 2. the second game is...simpler...its known as a shadow of its former self but the gameplay is easier to understand and control but all the while ruining the game with the experimental factories.

												This is one of the best rts games out there. Where you build factories and produce large amounts of units to battle your enemy. This game has a large amount of different ground, sea, and air units all with there own advanteges and disadvanteges. overall this is a great game with a lot of features and updates that give hours of fun and entertainment with replayabillity. The flow of combat is incredible and pvp is very fun however there can be lag sometimes so you might need a  very good computer to run it but so far it works good. So i highly recommend this game to anyone that wants a solid rts game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Supreme Commander Forged Alliance or SupCom Fa (My rough view of such game):The game that justifies ""Supremacy"",""Command"" and ""Epic Proportions"". Despite being a stand alone expansion perhaps projects itself of being the best game of the series through prevailing through the years of its active release while in a way it shares positive similarities with SupCom 1 and SupCom 2 (less). It presents a redefined approach through its differences.The game displays a literally huge project of future technology battling it out within these factions that players can choose. Each with a unique playstyle. All with the same goal of supremacy.SupCom Fa does a superb job at defining the genre of ""real time strategy"". Having the capabilities of generating large scale battles across complex maps. To the simple yet fluid battles that take into account miniscule details from the player.Most of the time games span from early-mid-late game transisition like all strategy games.There is never an idle state and if that is the case expect the unexpected. From the dreaded nuclear launch, surprise experimentals,innovative strategies or just a total economy stall.Heading into SupCom Fa's later years most people nowadays play on the Forged Alliance forever client(requies copy of game).A cosy community keeping this ancient treasure alive and updated. A testimony of how tenacious SupCom Fa is to its fans and providing the all out RTS experience. A true recommendation for fans of the RTS genre. Be weary of the somewhat steep learning curve and required dedicated time needed to play and maybe having to learn. But that is a worthy price to pay for what great potential can be mined from SupCom Fa.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an absolutely amazing RTS that is an improved standalone version of the original Supreme Commander. This version is by all means better than the original game with new units, a new race/faction, and a new campain. This game is kept alive over almost a decade after it's release with an amazing playerbase and modding community at Forged Alliance Forever (http://faforever.com)It's graphics are amazing for 2006, it doesn't need a great computer to run, it has hundreds and hundreds of mods adding units and maps, it has a great competitive and casual community, and it has the best gameplay mechanics of any RTS I've played.If you have questions to ask me about the game, please do not add me on Steam. Please either ask me at http://ask.fm/VelocityLP or PM me on Reddit. (http://reddit.com/u/Blaze17145) ",161,21,13,7,37,2,30

												I did have a working knowledge from having played the original, but I needed more than just a refresher. Fans of the series are definitely going to get more than they bargained for with this expansion pack.Faster gameplay, bigger maps, more units, and a new race.Forged Alliance does a good job at being exactly what it is – a stand-alone expansion delivering an entirely new faction to the world of Supreme Commander, a decent single-player campaign playable from any of three human perspectives, and new experimental units for each faction, including four brand-new experimentals for the new faction.

												over 4k hours outside of steam. Best rts ever, i can't like any other rts because simply to put it, they are not as large scale. You can send an army to a enemy base or send over a colossus sized tank, spider, spinning saucer, and more to completly crush the enemy. every second is super important. When your commander sets down for example, and if you don't focus on building an army and sending it before you can be hit, your score on the top right of your screen will show you are lower than most others. The game is just. beautiful to put it. And there are 4 factions, the aeon, the uef, the cybran, and the seraphim. Each with a unique build design and a unique way to play. Cybran get a experimental spider named Monkeylord which deals 2k damage per second, and the average comm has 12k. The uef for example get a tank called a fatboy. Its a mobile base which has powerful main cannons, which deal 200 damage a shot. Weak anti air, 2 repair pads for air forces, and can build units. Please consider buying this game, check out forged alliance forever and on youtube check out gyle. The community is as activeas can be since this game origionally came out in 2007. There are also huge mods avalible to download from moddb and such to add even more, but be careful please. Every mod you activate in the lobby, builds up ram.

												(This review is mostly for Supreme Commander as a whole, not only the FA expansion)One of my absolute favourites in the RTS genre, this game creates the sense of an actual war with its immense scale and (for its time) very good visuals (still looks pretty good). 4 nations, countless units divided into tiers, a fairly standard for the genre resource collection, and a fresh element (intel gathering) ensures a game with nigh limitless options for strategies, especially on the bigger maps (the largest ones are 80x80km in size, that can give you a rough idea just how big this game is). The expansion (Forged Alliance) brings in even more units, rebalances for existing ones and some new effects as well as a brand new faction (the Seraphim) that make it well worth the price, not to speak of the fact it's a standalone so you can play it without the original SupCom. The game also has mod support, and there are a few really good ones that were made since the game was released (some are still being updated).Simply put, a must-have for any RTS fan, few games will be able to bring you a similarly amazing experience such as this one.

												As someone who has played 100+ hrs on disc, after I picked it up in 2007, this game is totally worth it. Forged Alliance I never bothered with- but now that I've started it it seems to just add a new campaign and 20 or so units.PROS- An AI that actually (OMG) focuses on economies and defenses!- So many units, C&C can eat its hat(s)- Great modding community- Hours and hours of play vs Normal AI (C&C Hardcore is easier than them)- racked up about 9 hrs in one single game.- MASSIVE maps. Let's just say a massive artillery piece can't get half of one.- ACTIVE physics. Fire that nuke at the wrong time? Air force is gettin' halved, baby.- BIIGGGGGG economy requirements. You can't plop a Tiberium refinery and be done. You need to fight to secure Mass from enemies, and you need a ♥♥♥♥ ton of Energy.- AIs send lots of scouts at you, and engineers to remote locales to secure Mass- even sending bomber squadrons on sorties into your territory to take out a Mass collecter, then sending an engineer to rebuild it in their nameCONS- AIs focus on air.. But that may have something to do with me building lots and lots of gunships.- AI defenses too good- you'll need several hundred units to break through- AIs build massive armies... and then don't do a damn thing with them- SO MUCH MASS REQUIREMENT. I have over 15 T3s, and it doesn't make enough to build troops and a single building at once.- Interface sucks compared to original SupCom.			",9,2,0,2,4,0,4

I set up defenses and then they all attacked. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it was fun watching the defenses destroy the enemy units in a fantastic display of fireworks. This truly has stood the test of time, working on my modern Windows 8.Get it. Its worth twice the money it is right now. And on sales, its something you should get if you havent got it.

												This damn game. I really love the way strategy does end up playing out in this game, especially in skirmishes, you may know other games, like for example.. Hm.StarCraft 2 or Command and Conquer, average rounds are 20 minutes and 5 or a bit more. Now here's the thing, a round in Supreme Commander can take three hours , even. Three hours of attrition, requiring your focus and requiring everything , the game has its balance, it has its counters and if you compose your army well, you can break through the enemy's defence, take out their core components and then, if you're able to, you can go ahead and nuke their supply lines basically, the game builds up on an economy system where you don't pay-before-you-build but it's more of a pay-as-you-go system, which means you can have an economical flaw.Also, did I say it has nukes?

												First, my Vanilla Supcom Review:One of my favourite RTS's by  one of my favourite people, enough said.Not really: Supreme Commander is to this day an RTS whose scale rivals even upcoming projects such as the MMORTS Novus Aeterno. It doesn't get much more full scale than this. Each player commanding a thousand units is a common occurrence, as is an entire map scarred by artillery and nuclear bombs. Destructive environments, submersible tank-factories, beautiful graphics even for 6 years old, and a very solid if simple campaign make this game one of the best possible $15 buys in the RTS world at this time, please do yourself the favour of getting it.And now, Forged Alliance:Forged Alliance truly expands the Supreme Commander experience if the word was ever properly defined. Bringing new units, maps, a fresh new campaign and that campaign centering around a completely new playable race, Forged Alliance is also one of the best possible buys of the genre, particularly the gold edition with both games, for a very reasonable $20.Oh yea, and not only are there some awesome modders still very much active, but at the time of this review, the multiplayer servers are still on.

												A good and complex RTS title. If you like epic battles and science fiction than this is probably the game for you. The campaign is nice though nothing exceptional (and if you want to play it I suggest starting with ""Supreme Commander"" instead of this stand-alone expansion) but the game truly shines in Skirmish & Multiplayer.Maps range from about 20x20km to about 80x80km while units meassure between 10 and 100+ meters in size and ranges vary froma couple hundred meters to several kilimeters.Every battle feels epic, realistically scaled and just great! (Though the ressource management might need some time to get used to - but once you are it's great as well!)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looking for an RTS game on a Massive scale to the point it deserves to be called MRTS (Massive Real Time Strategy)? Look no furthure. This game will make your brain think non-stop with it's massive battles. I'm on easy mode just to get used to the controls and I'm already freaking out with how much i can and need to do (in a good way). Talk about 2 hours on one map, ON EASY MODE. I'm worried about hard mode.....no, no actually I'm excited. Once I get used to the controls and shortcuts of the keyboard, ooooh, it's gonna be ON!!Take note if your pc should be pretty beefy if you want a game like this to work smoothly.I've got;2GBS GDDR5Intel core i3 (3.5 GHz)16GB RamWestern Digital 1TB with SATA II cableWindows 8.1I have the game running on the best graphic settings I can and I haven't lag'd yet but some points it did.

												As the saying goes, ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is exactly that way. Although it doesn't have many pictures or even a video to introduce itself, it's a fantastic game that adds the extra nation of the Seraphim into the playable category. As one of it's popular tags suggests, this game is very underrated and is a suprisingly fun game. It ranges from the ground, to the sea, and to the air all the while containing massive mechanical deathbots capable of mass destruction and many a big boom. Forged Alliance also comes with a vast number of mods which can add a lot to the gameplay and are a great way to spice up the game a bit if your starting to get tired of it. Ultimately, I highly recommend this game and strongly encourage you to make the purchase.			",68,4,0,8,12,0,24

												This game is about explosions. This is evident because the default gameplay victory condition involves AT LEAST one explosion. WHen you start a match, your main unit spawns, the armoured comand unit (ACU). The goal of the game is to destroy all enemy ACUs. did i mention that when you kill an ACU it causes a nuclear explosion? You start by constructing a base, building resources extractors, power genrators, and factories. out of these factories come engineers and machines that are supposed to make other machines explode. There are several tiers of units. Tier one are rather small grunt type units, tanks and small mechs. tier two the tanks planes and ships get bigger, with bigger weaponry. you unlock thigns like tactical missel launchers and artilery pieces. Tier three is where all the badass units are. There are 4 factions in this game UEF, think of America on super space robot steroids, The Illuminate, a relligious group that's semi fanatical led by a princess. The badass cyborgs lef by a ginius who is somwhere around 900 years old. and then thier are the Seraphim, which are basiclly alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s out to comit nearly galactic genocide. There is also a tier four so to speak, its called the ""experimentals"". Exprimental units highlight what this game is about: Big ♥♥♥♥ing robots with big ♥♥♥♥ing cannons. And Lasers, did i mention the lasers. you know what? ive talked to much

												Best strategy game i've ever played the only problem I have with the game is the fact that its laggy because of all the things happening at the same time. Other than that the game is great. Lately there's been alot of complaints that the launcher is crashing and the game stops working. It's true, and I know that because it happened to my friend. There is still no fix for it because the games old and they stopped patching bugs like that, it's still is a great game and I definately recommend it to all strategy lovers. For example each player can have up to one-thousand units on the map at the same time. Therefore reasulting in alot of lag unless you have a newer gaming computer. How the lag occurs is when there's eight people in a single match and everyone has nearly a thousand units. Overall I rate this game a 9/10 because of the launcher failure...THUMBS UP!!!

												This is an excellent RTS especially considering its age. The factions are well balanced, game modes varied, and means of winning diverse.  Further, the tech tree is not to hard to learn while mastery of hte game takes longer (as it should). If you like RTS games which require building an economy and commanding an army, Supremem Commander: Forged Alliance is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not often a spiritual sequel lives up to the glory of it's predecessor - Supreme Commander (And this expansion, Forged Alliance), is one of those rare gems.With it's roots in the masterpiece that was Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander keeps that incredible feel of a glorious RTS with four well-balanced factions, unique units, each with their own checks and balances found among the other factions, mod compatibility, stunning graphics, intuitive but rewarding tech trees, and... The list just goes on. When you fight in Supreme Commander, anything can happen. You've begun your siege against the enemy and have an array of missile units; but wait, the enemy has tactical missile defenses, rendering your forces useless! Luckily for you, your chosen battlefield was just in range of your navy, who begin pummeling the shore with their artillery... Until their airborne torpedo bombers are on your radar... Did you bring AA cruisers? Or do you have your own air force in waiting?This is RTS at it's finest. As one who sunk countless hours into Total Annihilation as a child (and as an adult), this is one game that lives up to the greatness of it's origins, and is an absolute steal at $14.99. Give this one a try, you won't regret it.And if you're into older games, want to try the predecessor to SupCom, with a soundtrack epicly composed by Jeremy Soule (you may know him from Skyrim, Dungeon Siege, or Guild Wars 2 to name a few), check out Total Annihilation.

												Fantastic kind of old school strategy game.  Like its daddy total annihilation this is great fun to play.  Lots of valid strategies, plenty of units and buildings to fiddle with.  A decent selection of maps.  You can zoom in and micro control your units, or zoom right out and send them around as dots on the map for bigger battles.  Simple economy setup metal/energy.  Its a pretty simple game at heart but with enough complexity that you'll keep coming back and back back.  Please ignore my time in game, I only added it to steam recently but have played it for many many years from my original disk copy!  Can be bought for a bargain today and I would say its aged very gracefully.			",123,28,1,13,11,0,31

												WOW this game is good lets review it (story) now i cant say to much about the story because ive been playing online and skirmish but i will try my best its about the 3 factions UEF cybran and aeon (this is there old name) there is also a new faction that i cant remember the name of but its the enemy faction of the game anyway the other factions team up to stop them. thats all i can really say about the story as i havnt played much of it.(skirmish)this mode is great fun you set up a match options mods whatever and then you start an all out war with nukes tanks and jets all fighting it out you controle all of these units make them and destroy them the online mode is similer but with humans instead of computers.(mods) unlike the sequel of the game mods are actually supported with a full mod menu with start of mods that you can choose from.(cons)there isnt many however there are a few such as if you dont pick fast on your gameplay options the game is realy slow which may make the game boring to casual players aswell as this sometimes the AI is very overwhelming sometimes even on easy mode i sometimes struggled to win especially for casual players.(overall)this game is honestly better than SC2 however i feel like casual players wont enjoy the game and should stick to SC2 but this game is a masterpeice and i think hardcore RTS fans should pick it up.

												One of the grandest, large scale RTS games i've played. This game deserves every award it gets. Hundreds of units, massive titans, mein gott its so grand! Gigantic battles, death everyhwere, bullets flying and lasers alight; ah, its a true beauty to any warlord to watch. My only real problem with this title is that it is pretty mentally taxing; due to its unqiue building system instead of buying, your resources become drastically more important, my economy tanks fairly frerquently and I crash and burn. I list this as a bad, but this is great for the more masochistic or strategically minded people. People still play online, and the game features skirmish options aganist AI. Overall, I highly recommend to anyone who has the slightest interest in RTS games.			",114,10,0,19,3,0,15

												This is may favorite video game of all time. I bought the first game as a disk back in 2006, I have been playing it ever since and I still love the game. I did not like Supreme Comander 2 as much. Forged Alliance is a updated vertion of the origonal. Every game of this series runs without lag on any computer I have ever run it on. I have played it on about seven diferent computers since I got it. The game has a huge learning curve, and you never stop improving and learning. I will continue to play this game as long as I can, this is the best 20 bucks one could ever spend on a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As the saying goes, ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is exactly that way. Although it doesn't have many pictures or even a video to introduce itself, it's a fantastic game that adds the extra nation of the Seraphim into the playable category. As one of it's popular tags suggests, this game is very underrated and is a suprisingly fun game. It ranges from the ground, to the sea, and to the air all the while containing massive mechanical deathbots capable of mass destruction and many a big boom. Forged Alliance also comes with a vast number of mods which can add a lot to the gameplay and are a great way to spice up the game a bit if your starting to get tired of it. Ultimately, I highly recommend this game and strongly encourage you to make the purchase.			",68,4,0,8,12,0,24

												This is the king of RTS games, and my all time favorite game. You don't play it for the campaign. You play it for AI skirmishes and Multiplayer online matches. Now, you may ask, ""What makes this game so special?"". Well, the answer is CREATIVITY. I have never encountered a more creative real time strategy game. Ever. Period. After playing this, all other RTS's feel... weak, small, and insignificant. Why have 10 soldiers when you can have 100? Why have a handful of planes when you can build a monstrous flying Sui-saucer with a SPACE LASER BEAM. Why engage in a frontal assault when you can cripple their building economy, or send in stealth units behind their lines to eliminate defenses (This actually happened to me, someone built stealth field generators right on the opposite side of my island, and constructed a whole production facility.)? This game does not encourage blind rushes, or impulse purchasing. Every move needs to be calculated, every defense needs to be perfect, ever strategy needs a backup plan. There are three rules for playing this game- 1. Eliminate the Enemy (obviously). 2. Be intelligent with your decisions. 3. BE CREATIVE. That is what separates this game from the rest, it gives you the tools to be creative! Why spam units when you can construct another base all the way across the map, place your commander there, and wait until the enemy assaults your old base, and when they arrive, you swoop into their main base with planes, transports, and nukes, and annihilate the whole thing! The ability this game gives you, the ability to surprise your opponents, is so satisfying, so perfect, that every time one of my half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥nutcase ideas works, I do a fistpump and spin around in my office chair. If you like to be creative, then this game gets a check on your list. If you like massive scale, another check. If you like robots, lasers, tanks, planes, nukes, artillery, satellites, mobile fortresses, and Flying saucers that would make the aliens from Independence day jealous, then this game is for you.

Side note last story mission if u play as cybran u get to play all 3 factions =^.^=the Seraphim faction is playable in multi player only, i like playing them even more so if i can play as Aeon or Seraphim & have a friend give me a engi to the other <3 ANYWAYS....this game is got so many ways to play it & its a long term RTS and stuff takes forever to craft, but more than likely if it takes all day to craft its going to be something powerfull :3its also finding the right balance to build faster + keeping ur def up so u dont get killed that makes it a fun challenge.i just wish i owned it on steam, i have been playing it again using Faimly share lol, i know we had like 2-4 copy of the game around but my brother has the only 1 now it seems & he test redeemed it on steam & it worked lol to bad i cant find some the extra copys we had			",66,9,3,16,13,0,10

												Probably one of the greatest strategy games of all time, the creators of Total Annihilation bring us Supreme Commander. The appeal of an RTS lies in unique strategies that always have an advantage and a disadvantage. Knowing what you opponent is doing is half of the battle. The other half is actually trying to carry out your strategy effectively. There are 4 races you can choose from, each with their own units, Aeon, UEF, Cybran and Seraphim. They all have their own strength and weaknesses but ultimately its your own actions that determine the outcome of any game. The only downside, is to play multiplayer effectively, you need the 3rd party client FAF (forged alliance forever) which is hosted externally. There are extra mods and missions which is great. There is a ranking system to play serious games as well. I would definitely recommend this to people who want a challenging RTS			",133,27,4,11,34,0,42

												Supreme Commander: FA  Where does one begin?Born as a spiritual successor to Chris Taylor's revolutionary RTS Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander builds on TA's original formula and simply makes everything better.  Tech levels where weaponry gets more powerful, and expensive.  Land, Air, and Naval units to attack your enemies from all sides.  Being able to que up units and have them set to go to points and attack, patrol, or be air-lifted to places on the map, this game simply does it all for an RTS.  Gorgeous graphics, awesome effects, and a great sound score round it out.  If you are a fan of the RTS genre, this is simply a MUST HAVE/PLAY!The only flaw I can find with the game is that once you have four players with around ~750 units each, the game has to slow down to continue to keep things smooth.  I would love to see something where it could be optimized to be able to take advantage of today's powerful multi-core processors to be able to allow thousands of units to multiple players and render them smoothly in real time.  9.999/10			",99,7,0,12,13,0,26

												WOW this game is good lets review it (story) now i cant say to much about the story because ive been playing online and skirmish but i will try my best its about the 3 factions UEF cybran and aeon (this is there old name) there is also a new faction that i cant remember the name of but its the enemy faction of the game anyway the other factions team up to stop them. thats all i can really say about the story as i havnt played much of it.(skirmish)this mode is great fun you set up a match options mods whatever and then you start an all out war with nukes tanks and jets all fighting it out you controle all of these units make them and destroy them the online mode is similer but with humans instead of computers.(mods) unlike the sequel of the game mods are actually supported with a full mod menu with start of mods that you can choose from.(cons)there isnt many however there are a few such as if you dont pick fast on your gameplay options the game is realy slow which may make the game boring to casual players aswell as this sometimes the AI is very overwhelming sometimes even on easy mode i sometimes struggled to win especially for casual players.(overall)this game is honestly better than SC2 however i feel like casual players wont enjoy the game and should stick to SC2 but this game is a masterpeice and i think hardcore RTS fans should pick it up.

												The BEST rts game i have ever played!!!!When someone brags about a new rts and how they attaked an enemy with a large army of 50 ground units, HA, little do they know in this game that is classed as a scouting party i have  attacked some one with 250 units before oh and that wasnt just with ground this was 250 of each ground, air, and sea,  with a few huge experamental units in the mix alond side a lazer satelite to  make sure. As well as this i nuked him at the same time as the godly asault on his base to truely make sure he wouldnt suvive, and all this happened in a tiny bit of the map when fully zoomed out, not like other games where your head is trapped at a sertian height and u can only see a bit of the map at a time. This feature is in plase not for the fun of it but because the map is huge and i could of had that battle 100 times in different locations  at the same time and still the map wouldnt be full.10/10 would unleash godly army and own again			",68,6,0,10,10,0,35

												Still a great RTS game with nice sci-fi elements.Graphics could be considered dated, but eh. Instead of getting epic graphics, you get a great RTS large scale to play with. Thousands of units per player, can go up if you change the limit up to 5000 units per player. This can make everything slow down a lot, but on the flipside you get to watch thousands of units (air/land/sea) fight it out in slow motion. Zoom in at one section, zoom out to watch the whole thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like this game. Although it has a pretty steep learning curve, once you get the hang of it, you can't get enough of it. The official servers are down however, but there is a community based lobby that you can use to play. This lobby is called Forged Alliance Forever, and it adds a whole bunch of features that are not in the main game.			",99,11,0,20,20,1,28

												This is may favorite video game of all time. I bought the first game as a disk back in 2006, I have been playing it ever since and I still love the game. I did not like Supreme Comander 2 as much. Forged Alliance is a updated vertion of the origonal. Every game of this series runs without lag on any computer I have ever run it on. I have played it on about seven diferent computers since I got it. The game has a huge learning curve, and you never stop improving and learning. I will continue to play this game as long as I can, this is the best 20 bucks one could ever spend on a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With all the crap RTS's that have come down the pipeline in the recent years, I almost always end up coming back to this game. Don't let the hours on recorded fool you, I've play well over 1000 hours off steam. This game is everything that an RTS needs. It's got distinct factions, is well balance, plenty of units, the feel of real progression, viable units at all tiers of tech, and there is plenty of lore behind it. Do yourself a favor and if you are thinking about buying this game, just do it. You won't regret it. Fair warnign though  there is a bit of a steep learning curve. Just youtube a couple of matches and you'll get the jist. I love this game, and until Chris Taylor tops this, I'll be playing for years to come. (Also, if you want multiplayer, get Forged Alliance Forever)10/10 still the best RTS on the market at the moment.			",189,21,0,36,26,0,41

												This game was released in November 2007 and now, nine years later, is still the most multilayered and yet refined RTS I know of. There are land warfare, air warfare, naval warfare, intelligence warfare, missile warfare and everything inbetween. There are so many options to turn around the tide of battle that you never know when the next surprise is awaiting. The game still looks great, sounds great and feels great to play. There is no itch of gigantomania that this game can not satisfy (if your computer can run it, that is).Granted, there are a few annoying issues (e.g. you can't save mutliplayer saves and performance does drop significantly in apocalyptic end battles that involve thousands of units because barely any game uses multicore capabilities and neither does this one), but that doesn't change that this game is AWESOME. If you have any interest for the RTS genre at all, you need to have played this game. I don't think you'll regret it ;-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As the saying goes, ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is exactly that way. Although it doesn't have many pictures or even a video to introduce itself, it's a fantastic game that adds the extra nation of the Seraphim into the playable category. As one of it's popular tags suggests, this game is very underrated and is a suprisingly fun game. It ranges from the ground, to the sea, and to the air all the while containing massive mechanical deathbots capable of mass destruction and many a big boom. Forged Alliance also comes with a vast number of mods which can add a lot to the gameplay and are a great way to spice up the game a bit if your starting to get tired of it. Ultimately, I highly recommend this game and strongly encourage you to make the purchase.			",68,4,0,8,12,0,24

												Looking for an RTS game on a Massive scale to the point it deserves to be called MRTS (Massive Real Time Strategy)? Look no furthure. This game will make your brain think non-stop with it's massive battles. I'm on easy mode just to get used to the controls and I'm already freaking out with how much i can and need to do (in a good way). Talk about 2 hours on one map, ON EASY MODE. I'm worried about hard mode.....no, no actually I'm excited. Once I get used to the controls and shortcuts of the keyboard, ooooh, it's gonna be ON!!Take note if your pc should be pretty beefy if you want a game like this to work smoothly.I've got;2GBS GDDR5Intel core i3 (3.5 GHz)16GB RamWestern Digital 1TB with SATA II cableWindows 8.1I have the game running on the best graphic settings I can and I haven't lag'd yet but some points it did.

												The culmination of nearly twenty years of evolution in the RTS genre, the last great base building RTS, and the finest example of grand scale real-time strategy to grace any platform.Every RTS title since has failed to even approach the zenith established by Forged Alliance. With the industry switch to MOBAS and DOW clones, and the seeming death of the base building RTS, it is unlilkely that this game will ever be surpassed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An outstanding RTS that every strategist should buy. A soul succesor to Total Annahilation fans should recongnize the single Commander unit that constructs and attacks.Graphics & Sound:   The game is great on the eyes although this game was released in 2007 the graphics have aged phenomenally. You will need a beefy rig to run it on the highest setting and even at the lowest settings it still looks great. There are some issues with the engineers (construction units) getting lost between buildings.   The game's sound is pretty good but not the greatest. Miniguns sound like sharp and crisp, artillery have an umph to them, and blasters have a laser feel to them. Some sound effects go on loop or are just lounder than other ones around it. One big gripe is that you will not know where something is being attacked when it is off screen you will only hear explosions and projectiles; no marker showing where. The music on the other hand is pretty good music. It amps up when your are battling or under attack and then goes peaceful when it is calm.Gameplay:   Now to the nitty gritty of the game, the gameplay. Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is your typical RTS. The 4 factions (UEF, Cybran, Aeon, and the new Seraphim) feel uniquely different but still fall back on the basics of base building. You start with you commander known as an Armored Command Unit (ACU) that can create a base within minutes. There are to harvestable resources in the game, energy and mass. Energy is collected by building generators; while mass is only collected on limited mass points on the maps. Maps come in different sizes and climates. They range from 5km x 5km jungles to 81km x 81km tundras. The smallest maps are great for rush and harrassment tactics. On the flip side the larger maps are focused on artillery and other later game weapons. Speaking of weapons there are tons defense and offense tactics; from point defense to tactical missles to artillery and to the biggest and most expensive the Nuke. Each factions has 3 Tech levels that are upgraded through factories and your ACU. Each tech brings new units and new buildings that pack a bigger punch than the last. In addition to the 3 different tech levels each factions gain a hand full of experimental units that take a lot of resources to build but reck havoc on enemy units once they are completed.Verdict:   An amazing RTS that deserves more love than it has. I recommend picking it up with a couple of friends. There are endless possibilities that you can play each game and with actually people can be very challenging.8/10			",80,5,3,7,10,0,15

												Best of the series by far and at the rate of development of SupCom 3 it will probably stay. Despite its age it remains a true legend in the RTS world. Although complex there is so much more to do on this game from the economy and the varied choice of units. The maps for a start are huge and so large bases and huge armies are easy to have. If slightly poor graphics doesnt matter to you then get this as it will and it should be one of your top strategy games.			",85,3,0,5,13,0,34

So yeah my idea for a stoty line is that the seraphim army that invades in this game was just a small army and that they now are waiting for a moment oppertune to strike the cybran accidently re open a portal that they can more fully manipulate and all hell breaks lose. Obviouly there will have to be new tech but the same look and feel of the other games just better graphics quality and more stuff if you agree all SC fans RATE AND REPLY WITH MORE STORY IDEAS!!!!

												The closest remake you'll get to the original Total Annihilation so far, this game does nearly everything right, but the engine lets it down on the larger size engagements (talking 1000's of units) but don't worry; it doesn't get laggy without reason.Ideally, I recommend you find some mates to play it with, as the online is pretty average without FAForever, a 3rd party server browser, which I talk about in this blog post: http://tehrawt.blogspot.com/2011/12/supreme-commander-forged-alliance-is-on.htmlRegardless, it's definitely worth a buy if you liked any of the other SupComs or the original TA.

												Excellent, well balanced RTS.  It can take a lot of trial and error to get a handle on how to balance your resources, to survive against human players or tough AIs in skirmish mode, but it is worth the effort.  The campaign is a little easy, but fun (though I still think the story/campaign of the first game was better).If you are undecided whether to get this or Supreme Commander 2, get this one (get the gold edition) - it is a much better game than the sequel.

												If you are tired of a more traditional RTS formula delivered by C&C series and Starcraft, try this game!MULTIPLAYER community is still VERY MUCH ALIVE (visit www.faforever.com and get the lobby client). Steam multiplayer works as well,but you got the supreme(yes, intended) version of it on FAF.Also plenty of guides and tutorials avalible, tournaments still happening.Want to see how the gameplay looks like? Check out Gyle on youtube, he's casting game matches.Overall this is a brilliant RTS kept alive by the community for a decade now, very complex and with a steep learning curve. Also somewhat dated graphics, but if you're an RTS fan, you know that visuals are the least important thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is supposed to be the sequel to the inheritor of Total Annihalation's legacy. What it actually is is the best realization of the large scale sci fi Real Time Strategy genre of which TA was the flagship. While this title is a little difficult to get into and some of the single player missions are _brutal_, it shines in multiplayer and (as far as I know) still has a very active community. Although most people mod it using the Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) modset.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After you play this game, whenever you launch any other RTS game it'll be like ""Ew lol"". If you play RTS games to do strategy and not to experience a hybrid of OSU and League of Legends (for instance Starcraft II) , Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is the best choice you can make.If you're worried about multiplayer, it's still alive, but you'll need a lobby client called ""Forged Alliance Forever"".

												Absolutely one of my favorite RTS games. I'm not very good at RTS games but something in this game is very appealing. Resource management is simple enough yet a challenge, swinging lasers and pulse cannons and other scifi weapons are very fun to watch and there's no strategy that cannot be countered. Nothing is more fun than building an experimental super weapon and blast your foes' base with it. Truly a must-have game in your library!			",134,28,2,16,4,0,22

Their units balance firepower with armor, not like stupid cybran where all the units are tinfoil, or like UEF where the DPS is♥♥♥♥♥♥ With Othuums, u can rule the universe!! I've seen 10 take down a fatboy...10!!! 3: ILSHAVOHS!! Yup, these ♥♥♥♥ers get they're own catagory. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are basically T2.5 units. I've seen them kill Titans 1 on 1! 4: EXPERIMENTALS!! Yes, the Ythota is not good on its own, it needs support. I already went over how good the AssWasher is. Now, the Yolona Oss , oh man. This thing is in my opinion the best ♥♥♥♥ing game ender there. It build nukes faster than anti nuke can build anti!!! And once one missle hits........ 5: THE COMMANDERS!! double nano regen......that's it..... 6: SHEILDS!! The biggest and toughest sheilds, build like 5 and you're indestructible... 7: NAVY!! ............nuclear battleships...T2 submersible laser destroyers...... 8: T3 ARTY!!

They have the highest DPS on their ASF, I already mentioned the bombers, and their transports rock!! 11: SUPPORT ACUs HAVE TELEPORT!!Ok ok, I may have gotten carried away. I sometimes play aeon or maybe cybran (never UEF, ew) . But the point is, the game has a lot to it, and it's TONS of fun. But an important thing to note, is you should also download FAF, a third party let lobby. It has a large and active community, and has slightly altered meta, and game mechanics. Not to mention some cool alternate game modes. But steam servers still work, and are still active, but the mod resource rich is more popular, making for faster, more silly and relaxed games. I personally do both. FAF for good games, steam for crappy relaxed games.

												Search google for FAF. Link account with steam. Play Forged Alliance forever just using the expansion - nothing is locked, except campaign. I may not have many hours on this game, but that is due to FAF. FAF is a standalone client that many users went to after GPGnet shut down. Faf features ladders, custom games, ranked games and such. If steam could count my time in FAF it would be well above 600 hours. This is still the best and most advanced RTS on the market, don't be fooled by Supreme Commander 2. It doesn't come near this game.Scale is epic, and small battles at low tech is still more fun than in the C&C games for me. Tactics are many, not just a single kind of rush.Update 25-11-2016:Still the best RTS released since 2007.			",201,20,2,12,14,2,28

												Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance  is a more than decent RTS game. and while I still like Supreme Commander 2 better. There is something to say when someone asks you how good Forged Alliance is. The base multiplayer seems to no longer work properly, but coupled with the Forged Alliance Forever mod, you will find that there are still many people playing.  Thus  most of your time will probably be spent in the non Steam multiplayer.Forged Alliance is   a lot ""harder"" than Supreme Commander 2, and it takes a lot more to learn how to play Forged Alliance well than it does in Supcom 2.  There is a much larger focus on upgrades and micromanagement in Forged Alliance than there is in Supreme Commander 2. This leads to there being much slower longer lasting games than in Supreme Commander 2, where games feel very speedy in comparison. Over all I would definitely reccomend Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance to the more hard core RTS fans, because it is a pretty good RTS. However its age shows in many places and it does require a third party lobby to get any real enjoyment out of your multiplayer experience.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												I thought the online community of this game was dead, but to my delight it is still very much alive with the Forged Alliance Forever community driven app thing. Very fun game, my favorite rts of all time. Learning curve isn't super steep, it's fun to play. The online community still has plenty of players in each skill bracket to pick up games in the 1v1 ladder. If you want some heart pounding 1v1 or some 4v4 setons don't hesitate to check out the app. I hadn't played since around 2010, so I was scared at first lol, but don't be shy try out the game if you enjoyed it in the past. If you're new and thinking about it, try it, trust me. Fast paced rts with so many ways to win, just using your brain in this game is enough to get you the win sometimes. 4 amazing factions, very well balanced...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, if your going to get Supreme Commander, this should be at the top of your priority list. This adds another faction as well as tweaks in the gameplay and mechanics that allow for more play time and more interesting strategy styles. The game itself may seem standard for RTS games but that is more a strength than a weakness. Some more modern RTS games (talking to you Supreme Commander 2) can create a more simplified experience and cause the game to easily become stale and dull, whereas this game follows in line with classics like Age of Empires and even Command and Conquer with a larger unit management and a fun/ever changing atmosphere sure to entertain any RTS fans.If your looking for online play, this game has lost a large fraction in its community in the years and it may prove difficult to find other players online. There is a community online called Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever where people looking to play online and continue the life blood of the game gather, so check them out for the best way to find other players online.All in all, this game is fun and fresh for new-time players, and entertaining at least to veterans. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!See ya, planetside!			",6,1,0,3,2,0,3

 Originally posted on March 3, 2007 I played the beta for SupCom, so I have to admit, I knew what i was buying. This game is ambitious, and sets out to accomplish alot. The only thing really holding this game back from greatness is the blandness in play style of the races. I will explainGraphically, this game is very appealing, because of its size, scope, and style. It feels like real war, visually, and the mapping possibilities are endless. The maps are a little nondescript sometimes, and the models aren't exactly high poly, but the trade off for size of the battlefield is well worth it.The Orchestral themes are nice, but a little short. It feels like they have about 5 tracks of music for the whole game. The sound effects are just right, but nothing specialGameplay is what really makes this game a winner. The size, scale, variety of tactics and unit types make this game amazing to play, you just have to experience it for yourself, it's awesome.However, barring aesthetic differences, the races play almost identically. I think more could have been done to make their play styles distinctive. That is really this games one failing. It is still very much worth an RTS fans money.  UPDATE: The forged alliance expansion adds a fourth faction: aliens. It's pretty much awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(disclaimer, i am writing this abit fast for the steam nomination, whilte correct it is shorter and less in detail than that i would like)this game is one of my all time favorites, trough many lan parties and hours played it has earned the right to be my top rts game. the economics are a thinking mans game with things costing over its building time instead of instantly, meaning you could start build things that you could not afford at the moment, it also ment that you could tank your economics if you were not carefull.the scale of battles are amazing and the seamless zoom is the best.you can use the second screen as a map or zoom in on a spot were you need it.4 diffrent races with diffrent approachesmassive units that towers over starter units. it is strange, this game came out late 2007. and in almost 10 years there has never been another game (please correct me if i am wrong here) that has used two monitors better than this. it is a disgrace! but it just shows how much thought has gone into this game.

												I thought the online community of this game was dead, but to my delight it is still very much alive with the Forged Alliance Forever community driven app thing. Very fun game, my favorite rts of all time. Learning curve isn't super steep, it's fun to play. The online community still has plenty of players in each skill bracket to pick up games in the 1v1 ladder. If you want some heart pounding 1v1 or some 4v4 setons don't hesitate to check out the app. I hadn't played since around 2010, so I was scared at first lol, but don't be shy try out the game if you enjoyed it in the past. If you're new and thinking about it, try it, trust me. Fast paced rts with so many ways to win, just using your brain in this game is enough to get you the win sometimes. 4 amazing factions, very well balanced...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So...While this game is older, I have to say it's still one of the best RTS games on the market and well worth every penny of it's listed price, and more. It even out-shines its successor in game-play. Yes, this game has a somewhat steep learning curve, but that's what's beautiful about it, It keeps you finding new ways to adapt. And to date, this is still the only RTS I have found where you can steel one of every faction's builder units or buildings and create the ultimate army consisting of every faction's units. This game is golden, Get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Supreme Commander is a realtime strategy game featuring gameplay similar to Total Annihilation and Planetary Annihilation. Forged Alliance is the standalone ""expansion"" to the original Supreme Commander, where all the factions are featured including Seraphim which apparently is the alien race that Aeon got it's technology from.Supreme Commander is a game about macro-strategy and production above micro-strategy. There are no ""unit abilities"" in the same vein as in games such as Starcraft II. The game features a ""Streaming Economy"", where you can build anything regardless if you have the resource stored or not, but the building speed is dictated by how much resource you can stream into said building. So if you only have 5 metal to stream into a building but the building speed maximum would require 10 - you would theoretically only build at 50% speed. You can store more resources through building storage buildings, which acts as a resource buffer for you, but storage of resources are not infinite - the production that exceeds demands is simply lost.The game features a lot of UI improvements like being able to set up ferry lines and limited automation, repitition and the like. It lacks a few of the improvements from Planetary annihilation but so does planetary lack from improvements from this title.In the end it's just a great game overall, while it doesn't have the best of themes like the drama involved in even regular games of Company of Heroes - it's still a great game in its own right. It is deeply underappreciated game and one of my absolute favorite games of all time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With FAF (www.faforever.com) simply put the very best RTS that was ever made. Its a true shame that all RTS since have ignored its revolutionary overhaul of the genre and just stuck to the old, trusted and unoriginal mechanics of games like StarCraft and so forth.The controls are amazing, the concept is genius and the epicness is astounishing.This is one game that doesnt have to hide behind making the user click endlessly for easily automated actions or a general lack of depth. It just confronts you with the sheer aweomesness of the genre.However, it has a steep learning curve and most players that stick to it are the ones that like to watch casts of it. Thats probably because its somewhat difficult to aquire a good early grip on the game by JUST playing it.Dont make the mistake of confusing it with SupCom 2 though - that one was probably the very worst RTS of all times.

												Total Annihilation grew up, moved out of its parent's house, and then melted the entire planet's face.Seriously, everything I liked about TA is in SupCom in some fashion, but better. SC added features that (at the time) no other RTS had, like the megamap. Now, if your game doesn't have a megamap, don't bother to come to school - the other kids will just laugh and push your face into the dirt. Looking at you, Ashes.Shields are also a favorite of mine. In TA and other RTSes, when your defenses repel the infidels, they take damage that must be repaired. With shields, as long as the bubble stays up, the shield will regenerate over a relatively short period, and the defenses will keep on keepin' on. There are mods that add super bubbles (shields) that can stop practically anything, which leads to some ""battle of Hoth"" instances where ground forces must be sent in to take out the shield generator (if you sprint units inside the shield, they can attack things within) before the long-range bombardment destroys everything else. It is super fun.The game isn't perfect, though. The one overriding issue, apart from the developer being dead and no official multiplayer list servers, is performance. The game was developed in a time where dual-core PCs were a new thing, and was quite revolutionary in its multithreaded design. The simulation and the rendering pipeline are broken out to two threads, and this helps the game run fast on multicore systems. Unfortunately, the sim thread could really use being broken down into multiple threads itself. Mid to late game, even though the FPS will still be 100+, units will act slow. They move slow, react slow, missles and cannon shots will move slower. This is the sim thread being overwhelmed by the 2000+ units running about. Since the dev is gone, this will never be fixed, and that's a damn shame since the game is practically the perfect RTS otherwise.Regardless, buy this and enjoy! Actually runs really well on my I7-4770k throughout a match and is as much fun now as then!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although this game is old, i will show the pros and cons (pros won) of this game compared to Supreme Commander 2-Pros-A new ACU into the game.-Tech only comes from upgraded factories/ACU's/and engi's.-Can Build Multi ACU's for picking up or guarding the frontlines.-Upgradeable buildings are very useful instead of just reclaiming them for a better one.-AI adds more chalange than the AI in SC2-Experementels Look really cool and Pack alot of damage-Transportation Airships Have animation when picking up land units-The Logs and animation to the people talking in the campain are outstanding and is affected on what ACU type you choose-Upgradeable ACU's on the diffrent parts of the ACU, Example: right hand: Tech 3 buildable buildings.-Some Land Units (includeing the ACU) can walk in the water saveing a bunch of time instead of haveing to go around the water-WALLS, LOTS OF THEM! USE TO DESTROY EXPEREMENTALS, WALLS OP!!!!!!!!!!-When Destroying Main ACU, The explosion leaveing in the remains are really good includeing the strategeic missle launcher that has the same explosive effects.-One of the top ten RTS Games in Rock Paper Shotgun.-Cons-The graphics are lesser than SC2-More or less experementals-animation on ACU's are somewhat to little impress me-Less levels for campain-Building a Tech 3 unit takes more than half the time it takes for SC2 Nukes to set up, every 2 Tech 3 units is one nuke ready to launch.9/10 I think you should all go buy it rather than SC2 and make sure you BUILD WALLS 4 OPNESS!!!!!

												This is one of those RTS games you cannot stop playing. Been playing it ever since it came out. It has quite some similarities with total annihilation (which btw is also a very good RTS but quite old but at its time it was way ahead of its time) such as the commander and a flowing economy. If you like big armies, big units, strategy and ofcourse **** big explosions this is the game for you. However i would strongly suggest using FAforever especially if you want to play multiplayer. Not only that but it makes installing mods a walk in the park.Must have for any RTS fan.			",173,36,2,40,40,3,59

												To start off this is by far the best RTS that ever existed. This game is extremely large yet runs exceptionally fast and doesnt usually give anyone I know or me lag spikes really ever.  First off I think the fact that there are some 100-200 buildings in this game and about 100-125 units  and about 20-30 maps you never get bored. The game has this unexplainable aspect of true awesome about it. To tell the truth the story isnt very good or engaging and it get's boring after a short while but playing with others and solo without the story is really fun! The Gameplay is without a doubt the highlight of this game. If you are on the fence about this game dont be! Just get it you will NOT regret it like EVER!So overall 11/10 for the game  and if that's not enough IGN rated it at 8.6 if you know IGN that is saying A LOT!			",13,2,0,0,0,0,6

												Supreme Commander is a RTS (real time strategy) game.In the beginning I asked myself is this sim city or a RTS.First thing I notice you build a lot before you will go into battle sometimes.You can play the full battle power plan and upgrade to 3 levels building... as units.There is so much to build like buildings, shields, units, and upgrading them is extra job.The maps are freaking huge and somethings to big so you can get a cofe when you send some units to your enemies.You need a freaking manual or somebody to explain what to do with a lot of stuff because this is nog a basic RTS game like Red Alert 2.For me it's totally new and very challanging if you ask me.Do you like RTS game you really need to try this one out.I give it a 7/10 score.There a some fan made mods that makes this games much and much better balanced.

												Good game but the multiplayer portion doesn't run very well. Too many units and a second of gametime can take 10 seconds. A map can easily take 4-6 (real) hours to win on a 4x4 map. The AI isn't nearly as good as in the supreme commander without forged alliance, but the game is more balanced.  ",1280,529,93,186,187,22,306

												Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is the expansion that brings the Supreme Commander community to life. There is one new campaign that can be played through three times, once for each faction, with some differences in dialogue and secondary objectives between factions. New units add to mid- and late-game strategy, and the new faction gives greater variety in multiplayer games.What sets Supreme Commander apart from other RTS games is a combination of in-game cinematic graphics and the tactical nature of viewing the field. A player can rotate the map in almost any direction and at any angle to see units firing on each other. This is the first RTS game I've played that uses zooming for navigating the field as an alternative to a minimap. If you zoom out far enough, units show up as icons that immediately tell the player what role each unit plays. This unique ""tactical view"" also has a dual-screen mode, which allows the player to monitor and act on two places on the battlefield at once.The community of Forged Alliance players is still alive and well, with thousands of active players on a community-driven lobby (Forged Alliance Forever, FAF) that also keeps the game up-to-date.If you plan to get Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, get it together with the original Supreme Commander. The two games are like computer desk and chair; they each function fine on their own, but put them together and you get a whole different experience.			",58,22,1,0,14,2,17

												Probably the best RTS out there. You'll want to pick up the expansion, Forged Alliance, as well. Units conduct base building. I always liked that about a RTS. Huge scale battles, large tech tree (4 levels), 2 resource economy, 3 factions (4 on FA), good campaign and decent modding community. Naval units, air and ground forces plus point defenses, long range artillery, strategic weapons, shields, you name it, this game has it all. Easy to use but complex interface. Nothing quite like bombarding an enemy's base with heavy artillery and experimental units. The spiritual successor to Total Annihilation. Highly recommend to any RTS fan out there.

												To start off this is by far the best RTS that ever existed. This game is extremely large yet runs exceptionally fast and doesnt usually give anyone I know or me lag spikes really ever.  First off I think the fact that there are some 100-200 buildings in this game and about 100-125 units  and about 20-30 maps you never get bored. The game has this unexplainable aspect of true awesome about it. To tell the truth the story isnt very good or engaging and it get's boring after a short while but playing with others and solo without the story is really fun! The Gameplay is without a doubt the highlight of this game. If you are on the fence about this game dont be!

												I would recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of Massive scale RTS games.Pros.Massive scale, Land, Air and Sea!Good diversity in the factions, each one has they're strengths and weaknesses.Experimental units that can help break turtle defenses.Artillery structures and units that can truly be called artillery (long ranged not just longer then a standard unit)Resource management that makes you think, other wise you won't have much resources.Shields, layered shields that can help absorb damage.Tiered progression, You have tier 1-3 units and structures that in turn might be less effective against higher tiers but still have a use.Great graphics.Can't just spam units to win.Cons.Some what un-optimized, can be taxing on computers.Air Units can be some what over powered.Campaign was a bit short.Each faction while diverse, was lacking in specializations.

												This is one of those RTS games you cannot stop playing. Been playing it ever since it came out. It has quite some similarities with total annihilation (which btw is also a very good RTS but quite old but at its time it was way ahead of its time) such as the commander and a flowing economy. If you like big armies, big units, strategy and ofcourse **** big explosions this is the game for you. However i would strongly suggest using FAforever especially if you want to play multiplayer. Not only that but it makes installing mods a walk in the park.Must have for any RTS fan.			",173,36,2,40,40,3,59

												The number of hours steam shows is a lie, I have probably a few thousand hours into playing.  This is one of my favorite games.  I am currently playing it on my third computer.  It is the spiritual successor of Total Annihilation and very well done.  Well worth the money as it will end up costing you mere pennies per hour.  Like all RTS games you start with a few basic units, usually just your commander.  You then build factories, resource gathering, and military.  You then Explore, expand exploit and exterminate.  In supreme commander you have 4 tiers of units T1 to T3 and then experimental units, which are very expensive and take a long time to build, but are essentially game enders.  Each of the 4 races has its own unique units, strengths and weakenesses.  The experimentals also fill fairly specific roles, making enemy engineer capture a significant boost to your combat power.  It has been out long enough now that the units are all pretty well balanced.  If you are a fan of RTS games, I highly recommend this one. ",47,9,0,18,11,0,12

												I’ve been playing games for years. You know how you drift from one good game to another?  Going from Starcraft, Oblivion, Fallout 3, Skyrim, etc…But every time those games get a little old,  I always go back to this one.  For almost 10 years, this has always had me come back for more competitive fun. Good community, great videos online (Gyle, Brinkof Insanity, etc..).  This is truly one of the best games around, it just wasn’t as popular.  Be warned, it does have a very steep learning curve.  But all other strategy games are shallow compared to the depth of this game.(I also play through a player run organization called FAF {Forged Alliance Forever}.  If you play it go through their much better lobby and ranking system.  It is worth it!) ",35,7,0,11,9,0,22

												10 years later and this is still my favorite strategy game on the market. If you want strategy, this game is the definitive RTS.Many things I like about this game come down to preference, but if you want a strategy game with resource streams (continual and infinite resource collection), this game is the best of the category. There is very little micromanagement that has to be done to produce units, leaving the player to focus entirely on his/her armies. If there is one thing that makes this game shine, it is this lack of serious micromanagement in production and base-building.Supreme Commander is a shining example in the genre of Real Time Strategy.

												The greatest RTS of all time.  Period.Pros:+ Unit chain-pathing from a source building to create patrols.  Good players might not use this as much, but crappy players like me will no doubt LOVE the visual affect of watching the patrols running.+ 3 levels of technology for all units in a logarithmic expense.  I.e. it will take forever to get to the next tech if you try to jump too early, so the time building up creates a layering of the playing field.+ The single-player campaign is nice.  If you are interested in this, get the package that has FA and the orgiinal game to get the whole campaign.+ The campaign is the only place you'll hear voice acting.  All the sounds in a skirmish are just robotic machine noises and they are all nice to listen to.  The play field becomes this noisy droning clattering thing.+ This was the first game to have the feature ""zoom in wherever my mouse is pointing"".+ Templates are cool!Cons:- The UI seems old(ish) compared to recent games.  So don't make comparisons!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RTS: Subjective score: 8/10So you think you have the brains for strategy ?Well, this baby is all about strategy (it comes down to tactics as well as it is real time strategy, but if we compare this to - lets say - WC III, then WC III was heavily tactical RTS). In this game, you might send your troops in blind suicide mission to harass the enemy only to get some precious seconds to manage your economy/constructions.A good commander will have to:- Control key strategic points;- Pick the right types of constructs for the right type of the enemy's defenses/incoming attack waves;- Know when to strike & when to dig in and focus on technology;- Manage Land, Air, Naval (+submersible) units;- Utilise Intel (scout, radar, optical vision, radar stealth, even optical stealth);- Utilise strategic weapons such as artillery support for those turtle types.

												This game is amongst the best strategy games that has ever been made. It has tons of content, a good campaign and its easy to learn. There is one single design problem though that puts me off. There are ram limitations in the game engine which means that if you play with 4 ai bots or more your game will slow down to slow motion in late game. This happens because the engine cant use all the memory of your computer.The game is still worth a shot though as it is a unique strategic experience that you wont find in mosto ther strategy games. I personally love it even though it has ram limitations. Good graphics, fantastic gameplay, good unit variation, every faction is different gameplay wise and the music is fine. I rate this game 8/10 but from a neutral perspective I would rate it 6/10 not because the game is bad but because of the ram problems. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have not played a ton of RTS games in my gaming life but I have tried a bunch and watched videos about lots more. Forged Alliance is the best. There are SOME balance issues I guess but that can be debated.... like these super mega bad♥♥♥♥♥units called experimentals can just rip though a player's base more often then not. The balance is the massive cost of resources and length of time to produce one.But there are a lot of units. ALl of which can be used in different tactical senarios. For instance, the lowest tired and weakest assult bots can be easily defeated but in a swarm of them air lifted down they can swarm-fire gound and air defenses if done right. Higher tierd units cost more and take longer to produce but 3 tech III bomber jets can do a great deal of crippeling damage if your tactics are sound... moreso then a swarm of gunships.There is a degree of rock-paper-siscors to the RTS element but there are other factors as well. Tactics, player skill and even terrain play bigger roles then this group of units vs that group. You can zoom out to look at a 5km map and see all your units as small icons or zoom down to look at the legs of one of your smaller units. Tilt the camera around to actually SEE the terrain layout. Putting artillary units behind a small hill can protect them from tanks, for example... well, if the tanks don't flank the hill.There's a campaign but its ot that good. Fights and maps are fun but playing solo against AI is more fun to me then solo campaign. I owned this for years before I activated it on my steam account I have maybe 300 hours in it? So this is my go-to game when I wanna create an army or robots to blow up other robots. And there's nukes too.4/5 ...there is a player run client called FAF, or Forged Alliance Forever, that people use to play matches. Some game mod mods are also there as well as a very realistic hand coded AI by fans called Sorian AI. The AI sent me an IM saying ""I have a present for you..."" once before it launched a nuke at me. I give FAF 5/5 but you need a beefy modern PC to handle it well.			",36,20,0,25,20,0,7

												I'm sure that I WOULD like this game. I'm sure that I WOULD put a lot of time into it.But I can't.I can't because I don't understand it.The tutorial is poor to say the least. It tells you the absolute bare bones of the entire game and then shoves you into the deep end with no knowledge of what to do. I'm going to have to resort to to YouTube and finding out how to do it there which I don't like doing because I don't think you should have to. In the first mission you are given a half destroyed base with no knowledge of whether or not you should repair the base or build a new one. All that I would ask for is a little bit of handholding at the start of the mission to get you going. I'm going to reccomend this game to people who already know what they're doing with this series. If you don't, try it at your own risk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this Game! You start as a Commander and build up your forces. You build economy, Tech up and Attack with your Experimental forces! Epic Zoom. You can zoom out and see the whole map but you can also zoom in and watch the details of your Units.Strategic Missiles, Shields, Artillery, Experimental Superunits and nice Effects and Graphic.

												This... This game is from my childhood. it started with my dad buying the game Supreme commander. As a child it was VERY confusing to me. I dont really remember how many missions did i do but boy was i surprised when i came back to this after 4-6 years. (Yes i used the CD key to get SC and SC:FA to steam) When i found out supreme commander had another thing called Forged alliance i wanted to try it so bad, that i literally installed it the second i watched videos on it. Supreme commander is a game where you will literally FORGET about the textures on some places, For example a factory. it looks like its made in 16 bit or more when you look at it VERY closely. but when you dont really care about zooming on it and ""checking"" for good textures, it really looks like a clean, greatly made factory. Anyways Supreme commander has that kind of ""interest"" on it from large scale battles to building a base with checkpoints, scout bases, anything you can probably imagine in a RTS game. once i made 4 experimentals and rushed through the battlefield with them, assisted by ground troops and fighters, it struck me. ""This game is great!"" i said, and continued to nuke the enemy base and♥♥♥♥♥♥them with an army of mine. In short, SC:FA is a game where intelligence, positioning, strategizing, and executing are vital parts that you will understand in this Very greatly made game.Buy it, Commander. and show those darn enemies what a blast you are! now go to the battlefield! MAKE the enemy fear you! kneel upon you! And nuke the-Thats enough writing for me, whew. PS: This game WONT work on windows 10, so stay in windows 7!PPS: This game now has a community driven lobby named FAF = Forged Alliance Forever where you can decimate other players bases in great satisfaction!Peace.

												This review covers Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. Get both!One of the greatest RTS games of all time.If you like commanding hundreds of sea, air, and land units please read on.Don't let the low hours on Steam trick you. Eight of my friends and I bought this game on CD years ago. We would routinely play 6 to 8 co-op or multiplayer (free for all) games on LAN before the Internet speeds really got fast. I've got at least 1000 hours in this game with all the weekend LAN parties hosted at a bachelor pad.This game ruined my RTS experience by introducing or near perfecting some techniques.1. Virtually unlimited queueing of orders (patrol, move, etcetera). I've never hit a limit. I would reckon that I have had at least 100 orders queued without any issue to tens of different unit groups.2. Large scale battles. Each side can have hundreds of units (we've had 8 sides in one large battle).3. Mouse zoom in/out. I can't explain in words the many ways this feature is plain useful and should be the standard in RTS games. You can zoom into a low level (one unit) and out to see the entire map and units are then represented as particular icons (easily identifiable). You can issue any command or select any unit from low to high level zooms. It's plain awesome.4. True faction faction and unit differences. Big difference between tier 1, 2, 3, and experiental units.5. Interesting upgrade paths for commander with multiple paths (Builder, fighter, stealth, etc).6. Short cut keys to do same thing as mouse.7. Four factions that look, feel, and really behave different.8. True land, sea (above and below), and air units.9. Transports (air or sea) with fantastic transport queueing/ferry options.10. Graphics look great, even for an old game.11. Replayability (different campaigns as different factions, co-op, multiplayer, maps)12. Experimental units.13. Game balance. Almost every unit has a counterpart. Want to nuke people? Want to build anti-nuke system?14. Automation of engineers (patrol duty) to clear battle fields of wrecked metal or terrain and repair stationary units.15. Massive selection of buildings and units16...I'm sure I'm leaving stuff out.I'm trying to convince my wife to let me buy five more copies when on sale for my children. There are a few potty words in the campaign (hell, damn, etc) so I'm not sure if I can yet. I started to play this game again after years of playing other games. This RTS set the standard in so many areas that is effectively made me a critic of other RTS games that could continue the standard and improve it. None have.Note: I am playing with Windows 10 64-bit operating system with Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance executables set to Windows compatibility (Windows XP SP2). If I do not set this, then game crashes between levels. With it set, I haven't crashed yet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Forged Alliance improves upon Supreme Commander in every aspect. The only issue I really have with it, is that it's a standalone game and that they did not include these improvements in the base game, which could REALLY benefit from that.Some examples:- Better and smaller UI. Everything takes less clicks, is easier to find and takes up less space, giving you more space for glorious battles- Graphics seem to have been improved a bit as well- Land units now actually march in sensible formations from what I can tell. Previously the formation was torn apart when units were moving. This is better now.- Units in general respond better and faster to commands. Terrain navigation is much smoother.- Naval units no longer ignore commands are get stuck on terrain as far as I can tell. Previously naval units adopted ridiculously large formations and parts of your naval force would simply not move to a location if it thought there wasn't enough space. This might have possibly been, because naval units also had a tendency to get stuck on one another...- Air units are easier to handle and operate more efficiently it seems. They also now finally use landing pads the way they were designed to be used: USE ALL OF THEM, not just one when issueing the refuel order. It was pathetic to see 50 air units circle 1 landing pad when 10 were available. Now they use everything as it should be.The campaign spans another 6 missions which you can play as any of the 3 core factions with new units for each. However, you can't simply switch factions in the campaign and the missions do not change based on what faction you're playing. Just some dialogue and vaguely different units (since all 3 factions have at least mostly units that fulfill similar roles, just with different stats and armaments). Speaking of stats: The game has been completely rebalanced it seems. Also, there is a new faction you fight against in the campaign, which you can also play as in Multiplayer. Great ""addon"".

												This game gave me fond memories of my childhood. Personally it is one of the best RTS's ive played, and managing to stay that way. Being the winner of 6 E3 awars in 2006, you can expect some good things from this game. The mechanics are solid, and if you can see it, you can shoot it, even by unorthodox means. AKA an artillary hitting a plane that just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I still find it hilarious you can just reclaim your ally's stuff either because they stole your extractor spot, or you just feel like it. TIP for any players: thoes auto repair structures that are in this game? use them to mass produce experamentals. Ohhh, how many times ive caused my friends to rage when i show them the rain of fire with about 20 scathis's in about 5 minutes..			",114,13,0,18,21,2,27

												Alongside Starcraft and Wargame Red Dragon, this game is for the very serious and skilled RTS players. Immense micromanagement, flawness knowledge on every unit, hundreds of numbers rapidly changing on screen at once, the skill ceiling for this game is exceptionally high. If you are looking for a stimulating challange than this game is perfect for you.If your looking for a dumbed down version of this game, it's sequel proves more than adequete. But be warned, SC2 has less features, including one less faction. This game has much, much more to offer in terms of skirmish possibilites, maps, battle types and so on.			",47,7,0,7,5,0,8

												Originally bought it at release from gpg, I watched as gpg maintained it with decent attentionand effectiveness for a few years after release as I lost interest.GPG did a fairly good job maintaining the game, I look forward to the future work of thedevelopers, wherever the talent ends up. The company failed, but the game succeeded.The engine is solid, the graphical effects are reasonably solid in terms of being efficient,you can customize the graphic quality extensivly... allowing the game to work on a weaksystem... maybe an old laptop! (use a mouse)You should buy this game if you are a fan of rts. It may not be your favorite rts but ittakes some extremely unique advances from its peers, indeed it is fundementally not likeothers in the genre.  Its not anything like starcraft 2, and is not in competition with it,one cant reasonably argue which is the better rts... they are not similar enough to compare.this is an engrossing strategy game, the campaign is mediocre but the replay value of the gameis very high due to the extreme variability of the economic and military considerations based onmap position, distance from enemy... geography is a huge factor. Satisfaction from carnageis pretty high :D carnage lovers rejoice... there can be so much wreckage on a battlefield thatyour army cant even cross the god damned thing... I have dropped nukes on battlefields just to obliterate wreckage and pass trough.THAT is carnage!buy this game on sale. It is not the best thing ever but it is unique and stands alone in its field.the control and the scale are not repeated elsewhere.(the crews responsible for cavedog, TA, and  planetary anihilation have been made up of manyof the same people .)

												Really good game, and it works, people eather have a really shity comuter or never heard of Forge Alliance forever that makes it run better on bad computers and gives you the online multiplayer functions since the servers are down. I recommend this game for all RTS lovers that want's to play a difficult game with many units and huge scale combat 80x80km My hours is not correct here on steam, that is single player, Forge Alliance doesn't count h on steam.

												The reason for my low hours is due to me having a retail copy before this. This version was DRM free as far as I can remember.But why I dislike this game.You spend far too much time zoomed out and it honestly ruins the game. But because of how the game was made you can't really avoid this feature.All units are just unoriginal. The only unique stuff goes too the T4 units.The AI in SupCom have issues. For one it sends a long conga line of units that will barely be a threat. It keeps building T1 units when I have T2 and T3 Defense put up or have large T4 units strolling around.Late game are ended in some ways.Large amount of T4 units.Even Larger amount of ground T3 units.Mass amount of T3 Gunships.If you can mass produce a higher tier there is really no choice to go back. A T1 stand little chance against T2 and even less to T3.The game will still start to lag a bit when massive stuff are going on so I'm just gonna blame the engine for that. This is with just 1 AI and 2 human players.I've gotten Total Annihilation to work on Windows 10 and for me that is more enjoyable and a better game. Even with some UI flaws and have a chance to crash when you reach 1000 unit mark.But SupCom just feels a bit soulless for me. Mods didn't help all that much which is a pity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: April 10, 2015
												I found that Supreme Commander was such a brilliant game when it was first released i played it over and over again non stop (retail copy then not steam for you trolls who have noticed my game hours are not too great) i loved the commander and how things were built, loved the variety of  ground, air and sea units and loved multiplayer with my mates, however things change.Firstly the fact the game only uses 1 thread of 1 CPU in your system and as a result as the game goes on it piles where your units are where theirs are, shell trajectorys the AI tactics and so on and so forth into 1 thread so it bottlenecks after a period which in turn later on will slow the game down to every game second takes 3 real seconds, you can get the saurion ai patch to fix this somewhat.Unit AI more specifically YOUR unit AI, you spend the game not fighting the enemy but fighting your units as ground units will happily try and shell the tank that is behind a hill that they cant hit due to said hill in the way whilst being cleaned up by enemy tanks that have decided to come around the hill until they have line of sight, air units that just sit on the ground and when an enemy plane comes into range will just pick up and land somewhere else instead of engaging, usually when they take they are then destroyed by any fighters the enemy choose to bring with them.  Sea units are just like tanks and will try and shell things that are out of sight.The commander and anyother building unit can build/capture at range however they like to drive right up to your blueprint or enemy structure before attempting to build or capture, sometimes circling the object until they have found a direction they prefer to face.  Build time is important and building quick is important so any seconds you can save is great but when your commander or engineers fuss about getting into position its very frustrating.Super units are a great thing to build the hardship of your labours, of getting a good economy going to support building such a massive thing, the satisfaction of being able to survive this long to have built such a device and of corse the joy when it is finally complete and the sense of power that runs through you sends a chill up your spine....... but its short lived.  Super units are just as dumb as everything else in your arsenal if not worse i built a monkey lord from the cybran team and sent him off on his merry down the map just as the enemy team (aion) sent up their sacred assualt bot, now the monkey lord has a sweeping red laser which has a greater range than the laser on the assault bot so i though yeeeessss this should not be a problem and promptly told him to attack their assault bot only for him to walk straight by the bot whilst targeting tech 1 tanks of his own choosing stop when he had walked past it out of range of his laser and turn to try and correct this, obviously this was to late cause as soon as he got in range the assault bot had hit him with his laser during the pass and exploded as he stopped then the assault bot promptly cleaned up my base.Obviosly this game has been out a while so this review comes late but its just a warning to any people looking at getting this for the first time be prepared to be frustrated beyond belief at controlling one of the dumbest AI's ever in a strategy game, i cant be bothered to even try and defend this.

												It may just be a Windows 10 issue, but I had nearly no end of problems getting this game to even work at all. I went through dozens of potential fixes and eventually had to literally re-code one of the game files in order to get the thing to work. I probably wouldn't let that tint my overall review of the game if I found it more interesting. This game is like the blunt hammer approach to RTS games where you just hurl units at your opponent until they die and that's pretty much all there is to it. There's no research tree or diplomacy or any of that, it feels like the mechanics are straight out of an RTS game from a decade ago, which I guess a lot of people probably like, but I don't find particularly interesting. I've played a few games with friends and they last about an hour and feel extremely unsatifying. Granted, I was always at the lowest end of the totem pole in terms of score and whatnot, but just nothing really felt engaging about this game. There's not a lot of information given about each of the untis and such and some of the descriptions are vague and unhelpful. The resource section of the game feels like it has potential, but is mostly just an annoyance. There's only two resources in the game and it acts like it is a finely tuned machine where you have to be precise about energy consumption and mass use, but it doesn't give an easy way to monitor these things and keep the balance you need, so more often times than not, my time was spent in the high negatives or high positives and just guessing what units I could build or upgrade without tanking my economy. I will probably play some more with friends, but overall I see zero reason to play this game instead of Age of Empires II, a game where everything is laid out for you and gives you an easy way to manage and monitor your resources and units. As a general rule, I grade all RTS games in comparison to AoE2 and if the game can't beat out a game THAT old, I'm not really interested.			",112,26,0,17,11,0,13

												Interesting idea. Epic size. Boring campaign and atmosphereI played mostly skirmish and tried campaing. 30 hours I thinkAbout atmosphere. For example C&C, Red Alert, Starcarft, Age of Empires, Dark Colony - games with very strong atmosphere for me. You are very close to ground. You can see trees, ground, hear birds etc. You found smth new on every map. You need to be atentive to buildings, landscape etc, you need explore. Losing 1 unit can be important. Rules of game can change seriouslyIn SupCom you usually work on very high level. Units like an icon. It's cool several games, but I don't have emotionaly wish or dream to play SupCom. Also plays become very similiar			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Way back when, I chose the dawn of war games over SupCom. Those DoW games got me into the corresponding tabletop hobby, and I couldnt be happier with the people I've met and all the friends I've made from just buying one little game.A couple days ago, I spotted this on steam and decided to give it a try, see what I would have gotten had I chose this game instead.Before I go on, let me explain that I have always loved RTS games. DoW, AoE, Stronghold, C&C, etc. So when I saw this game and the massively positive reviews for it, I bought it straight away! It looked awesome, whole armies crushing your enemies underfoot, whats not to like?The game worked for me,   only one crash while I was in the tutorial. So no problem there.The problem was, well, the mechanics. I am used to a minimap, when I play againest my competitive friends, the minimap is needed for survival. The tutorial pointed out pretty quick that my screen IS my minimap. Great.Not only did I keep forgetting about it, its also extremely awkward to use. I kept playing without using it, making it seem to me that I was alone, when in fact there was a huge battle going on around me, and I couldnt see it.Secondly, there is a STEEP learning curve. The Controls take way too long to learn and master. I consider myself atleast competent when it comes to RTS's, I can normally figure out the controls in a game or two. With this game? Well, you may notice that I only have TWO hours played on it, and also that I've returned it. Well, thats because these games take HOURS to play. You can't bang out one game in a hour. Heck no. You have to be willing to SIT THERE and WAIT. Wait for your eco to boost up, wait for your buildings to build, wait for your units to be created. Each unit has around a 7-10 second timer. Even the weak units. Yes it has a HUGE pop cap of up to 1000, which is awesome. But for one thing.I can't get any resources. The game wont give you ANYTHING starting out, and resources come in at a TRICKLE. For my first skirmish game after the tutorial, I tried setting it on huge resources or whatever, and it does not have any. You are stuck with the regular resources, which let me tell you, are gone faster then ice placed in the middle of the sahara desert.I had to use CHEATS. CHEATS. To explore the mechanics of the game more fully. I am not one of those people who can sit down for 4-5 hours on ONE game.  This game is for you if you like slow paced afternoon-length games. If you cant invest the time and effort it takes to play this game, dont buy it. I spent two hours with this game. Only played ONE game. And I couldnt even finish it because it got boring using the cheats since it took to long trying to play the game with normal resources and setup.Poor economy, poor unit build time, confusing map interface,  extremely long length game battles without the resources to easily get said long games off the ground effectively, this is a MASSIVE dissapointment to me.Buy if your a HARDCORE RTS player who can spend hours in ONE GAME. If you like RTS' but dont want to invest hours in a single match, or are new to the genre on a whole, or just a casual gamer, SKIP. When I think of the people who might like this game, I think of a old man in his mid 70s.  It requires ALOT of patience. Kudos to anyone who can sit through it, I sure as h*ll cant.Its like you build a beautiful mansion, but then don't install plumbing or power, and only use one room out of the whole mansion.Dissapointed, gave it a chance, glad I chose DoW. Skip if you like anything thats not snail-paced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a NOT a terrific game. It's similar to the EA C&C games...i.e., a lot of strategy IS involved. It game forces you to make decisions in battle with your enemy.  you think! That is, if you want to win the various battles that you will become involved with. The odds of you going forward beyound the Normal mode is impossible. The programmers of this game are completetly out of touch of reality. Don't play this game...it will only disappoint you. I am very disappointed in the Supreme Commander's seriest. This game is impossible to win. The odds are against you. I suggest that you don't even attempt to play this game. The other two Supreme Commander games are great......this one is the worst possible game to play.Save you money...			",2,0,0,0,0,0,3

												This is an RTS I simply couldn't get into. The start-up felt too slow and the war portion didn't live up to my expectations. You are in charge of one robot who can build buildings. From that one robot, you can build resource based buildings and storage compartments as well as unit creation centers. From these buildings, specialized units can be built (air, ground and sea). War units can be build as well as other construction units specialized in their field. A ground construction unit can build an advance ground unit creation center. As for the game play itself,  haven't seen much that impresses me. The units are meek, the attacks seem bland, and the game play just sort of seems boring. I don't feel immersed when I play this game.I wouldn't recommend this game at all.6.0/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buying this game is buying an adventure in trying to making it run on a modern machine. I have 2 machines both running Windows 7, one is a 2008 dell 32 bit core duo and Nvidea graphics, and one is a 2013 Lenovo with I5 64 bit and ATI graphics, and as of yet, neither machine has been able to launch this game.A perusal of the forums suchs that this is not an uncommon problem, and that while some people are able to solve it by running it in compatability mode, deleting a game.prefs file (which my computer never actually gets far enough in launching this game to create) and unistalling logitech webcams, for the rest of us, its really $20 thrown out a window.

												Supcom will forever hold a place in my heart, as well as whatever disk space it needs.  Everyone has their ""top 5 games of all time"" list and this will remain on that list for the rest of my gaming life.  Since I first watched it in development to today, I have never stopped trumpeting just how amazing it really is.  I never miss a chance to try and convince every gamer I know to buy it.  I think I have donated at least five copies to my friends just to have them experiance it.Nearly every RTS before and after have been about just tanks and infantry in small teams... Maybe 100 units at the very most.  Air was usually limited to planes that magically hover in the air and shoot at things until they ran out of ammo, and navy, if present at all, was far less effective than it should really be.  Nuclear weapons and WMD's in Command and Conquer or Starcraft would maybe kill a dozen units and destroy a couple buildings if placed properly.  Nukes in Supcom incinerate everything on the screen, as they absolutly should.Supcom went beyond the level of being a video game and truly pushing the idea of a simulation.  Much like Steel Battalion or high end flight simulators, this game is less a game than it is an experiance.  High APM click-fests (Starcraft) are lauded as the best of the best in the unfairly small RTS genre, but relied far less on tactics and strategy than they did a small group (or in some cases, an individual unit) winning a single battle which mostly judged the outcome of the game.  Supcom recognized that warfare takes a long time, and even the fastest battles are often an attrition match.  The smallest fights often involve dozens of units on each side, with the largest brawls involving hundreds of tanks, artillery support from a secondary line, dozens of aircraft bombing the ground forces and fighting the other aircraft, and fire support from naval units miles away.  This is why Supcom will always stand out as the premier RTS of all time... it is the only one to recognize that there is more to it than a few tanks at a time... Ground air and sea work in conjunction to support eachother.If you have never played this game before, you are truly missing out.  It is something that everyone needs to experiance.  There likely will never be anything else like it.  Even for an 8 year old game, it still looks and sounds amazing.  Nothing else has ever truly given the scale of a warfare simulation like Supcom does.  It is however, punishingly difficult to learn.  There is so much nuance to this game, that people often develop a misconception that the races are too similar when they first learn to play.  It isin't until a deep understanding of the game is reached does the vast differences between the factions becomes realized.  Each side has subtle differences that measure not just the raw stats of the units, but the entire playstyle and even the lore-based philosophy of the faction.  Finally, you can't fanboy this game without mentioning the amazing community of FAF.  It took over running everything when GPG went down.  That so much support exists for a game this old and largely un-mainstream speaks more for it's merits than I ever could.  If you are still unsure of this game being worth checking out, please visit the FAF site at: http://www.faforever.com/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worth To buy as the Gold Edition with the original game Supreme Commander. As a standalone you are not able to play all factions from the original game. You can build all tech trees from the beginning on in campaign. This is ne of the best large scale rts games ever, if not the best. Still nice graphics and from the standpoint of gameplay even not met by his successor Supreme Commander 2. It needs a bit learning as a beginenr, but it is so so much fun to play.Strongly recommended on sale (Gold Edition ~3 € at that time 80% off)!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I grew up with SupCom 1 and 2 for Xbox 360... 1 was always the better game, but it had way too many bugs.  When I came over to PC, I found that there was an expansion to 1 (Forged Alliance) - I love it!  I bought this as a bundle with the first one since it's only $5 more to get both - The first one is only realy worth it if you want to know the full story.If you like C&C series, I highly reccomend - same great sci-fi RTS visuals, but WAY more freedom!

												This is a beast of a game, and used to require a beast of a machine when it was released. Nowadays, however, most PCs can run it on average settings, few can run it on high settings, and even fewer can't run it at all. Sup Com FA allows you to play massive single player and multiplayer skirmishes that can have up to 8000 units on the field at once. While it does take strategy to win against the best of opponents, any newcomer can pick it up and figure out the whole game in less than 10 minutes. While in skirmish, the game sometimes seems like more of a DLC for the original Supreme Commander, the new campaign, massive amount of added units, and balance tweaks make it technically a full game. Over all, it's a good game that's worth the $15.(I should make it known that this game is much better than it's sequel, Supreme Commander 2.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, likely one of the best purchases I've ever made on Steam, literally. I have nearly 500 in game hours banked into this game and I tell all my gaming friends to try it out. It may not be the most complex or wide scale strategy game out there, but it offers players a fast paced, visually pleasing display of massive battles and base building. It takes a little while to adjust to the drain based resource system. If you're not careful, you can wind up zeroing out on both resource types and your war efforts drop to a crawl and you quickly become cannon fodder.The one thing I absolutely love about this game is the custimization for gameplay. There is no set difficulty, you can pick and choose what kinds of AI you want to play against, whether it be turtles, air, ground, or navy based, or perhaps you prefer a rush style of play, where everyone is hurtling hundreds of puny tanks at each other until someone drops in a massive experimental to slaughter one side or the other. Either way, its the players choice. I also love how easily the game can be modded, I'm not saying its Minecraft where there are thousands of mods out there, but for anyone looking to expand the chaos and scale of the game, drop by the Total Mayhem page on ModdB or perhaps go for the Black Ops mod set.Don't let the age of this game fool you, it may be a few years old, but even the best PC's will eventually lag while trying to handle this game. And yeah, I know, that doesn't sound great, and its not, and it can be annoying, but it gives you a sense of just how massive the game can be.			",61,5,0,15,8,0,49

												Where should I start? Well, Forged Alliance is nothing like the original Supreme Commander even it is labeled as its standalone expansion. The game got a little overhauled and much more with mods (look for BattleFeel ), and the somehow they managed to get the gameplay more thrilling, more intensive and more challanging.I'll give  9/10  (I would give a 10 because SupCom2 was waay disappointing, it should deserve a real successor what could take away its throne. )It has everything that a strategy game needs: global warefare, massive amount of units and just massive units. I found the resource system very pleasing, the more extractor you have, the multiplier will increase until it reaches its capacity. It also applies on building things, the more builder you have, the multiplier will decrease into negative, until it depletes.And no f**ing cards like in Red Alert 3, which have nothing to do with strategy games! I don't even know who came up with the silly idea that me as a commander have no authority to build the best weapons they have already researched? Nooo.. Someone have to watch over for me, and give me smiley faces every time I do something right.B*****it.So if You searching for a strategy game which is easy to play and hard to master, I think You already found it. ;)			",499,113,15,59,22,5,50

												Spiritual successor to Total Annihilation. A good RTS if you like big units and bigger explosions and dislike excessive micromanagement. Forged Alliance fixes a lot of things with SupCom, adds a new faction and several units, and generally plays a lot better. It also works fine just a standalone expansion with its own single-player campaign (pretty short, but you can replay via any of the factions with some different in-mission plot details.)EDIT: Recently, I discovered a whole online community at http://www.faforever.com/ that maintains a mod enabling online multiplayer on FAF servers (necessary since GPG shut down their servers) along with new modes, some balancing issues, tons of new maps, and incorporating several other useful mods [notably, Sorian AI for a decent computer player]).

												This is still my favourite RTS game, and its been out since Nov 2007 can you believe! Nothing else comes close it terms of scale, variety of strategies and pure awesomeness (including Planetary Annihilation). When it was released this needed a very high end computer to play nicely, but today the game will look great on most gaming computers. Single player is fun, but multiplayer is where it comes alive. The vanilla version of Supreme Commander was the first game to give you Strategic Zoom (which lets you zoom from a high level view of the entire map right down to individual units with the flick of the mouse wheel) and has a massive variety of units and strategies. You might base your strategy on overwheliming the enemy with low level units, or alternatively sit back and build your economy so you can afford a devestating experimental unit. And of course there's always the nuclear option.While the basic game works fine and there is a multiplayer lobby inegrated with steam for the steam version you really want to download Forged Alliance Forever. This is a community built multiplayer lobby, which has matchmaking, map and replay vaults, popular mods etc, and has helped massively extend the life of the game.Nuclear launch detected...

Has a 4th new faction you get to play with in skirmish/online/lan mode, AI is much tougher,new units for the 3 original factions of Supreme Commander 1. And has lots more strat abilities then the vanilla game did.A caution of warning if you have a single core processor do not get this, it requires at least 2 core to fully be enjoyed, its a slight resoure hog.

												Being a fan of Total Anhilation, I quest at the doors for Supreme Commander on day 1 in the UK.The game stands the test of time, and is and amazing platform for a war stratagy game.For years i've upgraded my PC to get a better playing experiance, but after recently buying a max spec iMac (2014), and STILL HAVING LAG with just 80+ units, i figured there must be something wrong with the code. Then i DISSASBLED THE WEAPON RANGE RINGS, and it was as smooth as could be. These rings must be difficult for the code to calculate, although as a programmer myself, i would have thought that a 2d single colour image would have been nothing???Hope this helps someone solve their lag issues			",53,0,0,3,4,0,12

												This is the best game I have ever played, the capaign is short but fun however multiplayer is where the magic happens - as GPG no longer exists you MUST get FAF http://www.faforever.com/ - a community mulitplayer lobby client for Forged Alliance, it features matchmaking, ladder matches, automatic downloading of new mods/maps for any games you join not to mention improvements to the game balances and also core features themselve (12 player multiplayer!)The game itself is for me is the pinicle of real-time strategy gaming, games support 1000s of units, tank shells, missiles, flak is all simulated so cunning micro management of your units can actually let you dodge enemy fire (lesser games simlify this to a game of scissors, paper, stone meaning if you are outnumbered you usually have to watch them die or jab special hot keys for each unit like a maniac)Be warned however to get into multiplayer you will have to overcome a steep learning curve, however there are plenty of noob friendly hosts on FAF and many Youtube videos which can show you the basics of build orders and managing your economy.

												At time of writing, steam says I have 100 hours on record. If you included that fact that this wasn't a steam game until after the company went bust - it would probably be up around the 500-600 hour mark. FIVE HUNDRED.and i'm not alone - read most of the top reviews and they will have scores up in the hundreds of hours too! Think of an entire Command and Conquer battle as a mere squadfight compared to SupCom (literally!) with hundreds of mechanical units going to battle at your command. If this sounds familiar, that's because it's another creation from Chris Taylor* Total Annihilation: 7/10* Supreme Commander GOLD: 9/10* Supreme Commander 2: 6/10* Planetary Anniliation: 6.1/10I write this review, because this week, the designers latest installment: Planetary Annihilation was released, and as much as I want to LOVE it, it is still buggy as hell, and honestly, you are better playing this game for another year until that one is ready to invest you hard-earned money in... and oh heck yeah, it will be... assuming that Uber doesnt bury themselves first by releasing what is still a Beta not ready for fair assessment.

												Spiritual succesor to Total Annihilatoin they said. Well I agree but there are a couple of things that still make the original TA a better game. For starters SupCom takes a LONG time to get a base up and running at maximum efficiency with multiple factories churning out tanks and bots, and the problem is that the AI immediately begins attacking you fom the start so unless you repel the first rush properly and you are able to repel each subsequent attack on your position, because by the time you have dealt with the first the second is often already on the way, then you are screwed. The maps are much larger which makes for more epic combat and I must say this is a good thing. You can play with more than 4 players on one map as opposed to TA and that is also good. There are three tech levels instead of two and the ability to customize your commander unit which is also pretty cool but beware that upgrading takes much MUCH more ressources, easily exponential amounts which means if your ressources infrastructures are not ready your facotories will simply stop producing. This is what I had the most trouble with in this game whereas in TA I always got the upper hand on the ressource situation I have a very difficult time maintaining my production in this game because of how expensive good units are. Producing masses of tech one level units is simplky not worht it because a tech two unit can easily outmatch upwards of a dozen tech one units and so on for a tech three unit. Furthermore on the ressource issue, the AI methodically targets your ressource infrastucture before even targetting defensive turrets at times which simply adds to the trouble of collecting enough ressources to maintain production. This is not a complaint in itself just somkething that adds to my troubles with the game.All in all this game is very good though if you liked TA just don't expect it to be a revamped reworked version of the 1997 classic because this game has a flavour all of its own. Epic battles await and Nukes are awesome in this game.cheers			",76,1,0,9,18,0,37

												Where should I start? Well, Forged Alliance is nothing like the original Supreme Commander even it is labeled as its standalone expansion. The game got a little overhauled and much more with mods (look for BattleFeel ), and the somehow they managed to get the gameplay more thrilling, more intensive and more challanging.I'll give  9/10  (I would give a 10 because SupCom2 was waay disappointing, it should deserve a real successor what could take away its throne. )It has everything that a strategy game needs: global warefare, massive amount of units and just massive units. I found the resource system very pleasing, the more extractor you have, the multiplier will increase until it reaches its capacity. It also applies on building things, the more builder you have, the multiplier will decrease into negative, until it depletes.And no f**ing cards like in Red Alert 3, which have nothing to do with strategy games! I don't even know who came up with the silly idea that me as a commander have no authority to build the best weapons they have already researched? Nooo.. Someone have to watch over for me, and give me smiley faces every time I do something right.B*****it.So if You searching for a strategy game which is easy to play and hard to master, I think You already found it. ;)			",499,113,15,59,22,5,50

												This game is heavily based on strategy and such.  game play can be difficult at first but once you know what units are good against others it gets interesting.You command an all important unit that if killed, looses you the game like the King in Chess.This is no first person shooter and focuses on an overall view of the battle field.The campaign is fairly neat and difficult at times but the dialog is lacking, however, this is the only thing that could have been better for me.It is definatly one of my favorite real time strategy games because of the huge divercity in units and structures, maps and settings.anyone who is in to this kind of gameplay will not be dissapointed ",44,5,0,5,15,0,10

												In my opinion, Forged Alliance can only be described as one of the best Real-Time RTS games of its type. Despite its age it still looks modern with high graphics settings and the addition of a 4th race to the game expands the gameplay possibility compared to the original. However the best thing about this game is the loyal community that continue support of the game with new updates and balance changes through the Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) Lobby after support for the game ceased. FAF provides the essential multiplayer this game absolutly thrives on, the game is still very competitive through the multiplayer and therefore I can also recommend Forged Alliance to seasoned veterans of the RTS genre. The game has quite a steep learning curve though and the fact that there can be 1000s of units on the battlefield means that the game can be laggy unless you have a good computer. Despite this, I think it is a brilliant title that is definitly worth your time if you have any interest whatsoever in the genre, especially as this part of the genre has very little competition.

												A bittersweet standalone expansion to Supreme Commander that polishes the user experience to be smoother than before. The complexity and depth of this strategy game can have fans playing for years without ever coming close to mastering it, but it lacks a worthy multiplayer community to take advantage of it. The visuals still seem acceptable despite being over 5 years old and the soundscape is far better than that of the sequel, but oddly enough, it still is very demanding as far as CPU power spec goes, favoring modern desktop Intel processors (ex. Core i5 2500k/3570k), much more than AMDs offerings. For a game with four diverse factions and multiple theaters of war (land/hover, aircraft/low orbit/long range missiles, naval/amphib, etc.), this game has enough strategic variety to produce some truly memorable battles, but could be much better. The campaign treats you to a brief sci-fi story of humanity facing extinction by the hands of aliens, but having no time limit makes it a bit easy if you just build up before progressing to the next stage. The AI in skirmish mode is no challenge once its pattern is figured out, or too hard if you choose to play the cheating ""AIx"". Fortunately, this game is mod friendly and many mods have been released that further enhance and refresh the game experience, such as BlackOps Unleashed. A separate community driven multiplayer lobby, FA Forever, has emerged and is maturing to help keep the fire in this game lit for strategy gamers worldwide to enjoy. Gamers who have enjoyed this or Total Annihilation years ago may likely find it is worth getting [back] into this for some semi-competitive multiplayer action.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have yet to play a game that matches this one's sheer epicness and intricate gameplay, my only complaint is that the unit management system is pretty much broken, causing serious problems in big battles (I am talking hundreds of units here), the units have pathfinding issues, and will bump into each other way too often, the reason I have lost countless battles.

												I recently picked this up after playing alot of Planetary Annihilation. I used to play this and Supreme Commander back when they were first released, years ago. I hadnt touched this game in several years and its been really fun to play it on a system that handles it in high performance.In some ways PA is a harder game to play than this and in others this game is as RTS hard mode as it gets. The economy can be very difficult to learn and hold steady. Keep at it though because once you crack the nut of resource mangment you start playing a game that is wholey unique. The maps are huge and the unit count is massive. This game is slower than PA but in a good way. Long games are beautiful to behold; armies of tanks, bots and mobile artillary duke it out while waves and waves of planes fight in the air. Huge artillary batteries and strategic missle launchers lay waste to the map and it always ends up looking like a metal waste land when all the wreckage is strewn across the map. If you enjoy very strategic thinking and RTS games I highly recommend this game. If your a casual or new RTS player, play this with caution, it may be overwhelming.			",103,8,1,16,5,1,25

												This game has a VERY active community with Forged Alliance Forever.  There is a big reason why this game is still going strong after all these years:  It is the best RTS ever made.  I tried others, such as Star Craft 2, but it felt dated compared to this.  Get this game, go to Forged Alliance Forever, and download what you need to join the community.  Play skirmishes against the computer to familiarize yourself.  Go and watch videos on strategies and build orders for your base.  You won't be disappointed.  I still play this game and have never tired of it after all these years.  I am STILL learning new strategies, unit abilities, etc.  It is DEEP.			",107,5,4,7,13,1,14

												A must-have for every serious gamer out there, specially those who are fascinated by fast-paced and spectacular RTS games. It is based of course on the amazing in its own rights ""Supreme Commander"" (and that in turn on the even older classic gem labeled ""Total Annihilation""), but expands it with a whole new race, new units and game fixes that balance many of its predecessor's features. Not only does it fulfill its RTS expectations but, imho, it expands and sets a new paradigm for the whole genre. Nuclear blasts, incredible massive experimental units of formidable power, shielding and cloaking abilities, are just a few of the things expected in the game. If you are in for an addictive gameplay and an enthusiastic community - even after all these years - that supports the game, then you should go ahead try it.			",65,3,1,6,2,0,8

												Being a fan of Total Anhilation, I quest at the doors for Supreme Commander on day 1 in the UK.The game stands the test of time, and is and amazing platform for a war stratagy game.For years i've upgraded my PC to get a better playing experiance, but after recently buying a max spec iMac (2014), and STILL HAVING LAG with just 80+ units, i figured there must be something wrong with the code. Then i DISSASBLED THE WEAPON RANGE RINGS, and it was as smooth as could be. These rings must be difficult for the code to calculate, although as a programmer myself, i would have thought that a 2d single colour image would have been nothing???Hope this helps someone solve their lag issues			",53,0,0,3,4,0,12

Good thingsI have spent hundreds of hours playing this game and it is really worth its price.  It is a newer version of Total Annihilation. The game is quite innovative and has features not seen before (or very rare) in other RTS games: you can zoom out the main view so that you see the entire map you can split the main view into two hence being able to see to different areas of the map, each of the views has full zoom support so you can use one of them as a global map (i.e. have it always zoomed out) on top of that, there is also a minimap, which is just another view with all the same features (e.g. you can zoom in), furthemore you can place it anywhere you want or switch it off support for multi-display computers, so you can have a ""minimap"" of the size of your secondary display device you can queue and loop factories' production you can queue buildings to be built by constructors in your factories, you can set not only a rally point but the entire path of tasks, e.g. newly constructed robot will go to the transport ship that will transport it closer to enemy base and then it will patrol the area. The transport ship automatically comes back to the pickup point for new robots you can select multiple buildings and save them as a schematic so the next time you can order the construction of all of them with single click the resource management is the most interesting part - instead of having just stored resources you have storage and production. You can start a construction even if you don't have enough resources stored. A few examples how it works: the building costs 1500 metal, you have +30 metal per second and your constructor uses 15 metal per second - it will take 100 seconds you finish construction you add another constructor so together they use 30 metal per second - your metal production drops to 0 and the building will be constructed in 50 seconds you have 3 constructors building two such buildings at the same time, with storage empty you train to use 45 metal per second while your production is only 30. This means that each constructor will be using only 10 metal per second instead of 15 they use normally. So the building with two constructors assigned will be finished in 1500/20 = 75 seconds, by that time the second building with one constructor assigned will have only 75 * 10 = 750 metal used meaning it's 50% complete you can order your constructors to support one or many buildings so they will automatically repair them or rebuild destroyed onesBad thingsThe game has one huge disadvantage with no work around (there are mods which slightly improve it). On large maps with large unit limits (e.g. 1000) the AI creates so many units that it cannot handle it, which slows the game down (there are no FPS issues, but 10 second in reality is 1 second in game). There are no issues in the campaign, multiplayer and on smaller maps.Other notes it is worth playing Supreme Commander's campaign before you get used to new units added in this stand-alone expansion the best features of this game listed above have been removed in Supreme Commander 2, making it a classic RTS which has nothing to do with Supreme Commander, Forged Alliance or Total Annihilation ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first got this game, it was hard as nails, then I played it a little bit more, and got more strategy involved, me personally try to never use the same plan twice, because in this game, strategy is always changing...  Well I couldn't find my disk to reinstall it to this computer, and finally, just got it for steam on this computer...  I love this game, the first one and this one forged alliance...  The mods and maps that you can find online are awesome.  I love these original, I don't like #2, that one is stupid and doesn't even use as much stategy or tactics it takes to actually play like in this one.  This one however is the bomb...  BEST strategy game I've ever played right here.  I give it a 10/10 because this is real strategy with amazing graphics, great story, and the ability to actually see how hard things really get, like Dark Souls, but Strategy.  Recommend= YES!  Expecially if you like/love strategy games and are looking to test you skills, or if you want a real challenge.			",74,13,0,12,46,0,33

												My favorite RTS of all time. More massive in scale than anything I have ever seen, overwhelmed every CPU when it was released in 2007 (due to accuracy in simulation unlike any other RTS), now runs OK on newer generation CPUs.A really different RTS, no research tree, all units are available from the start, very complex and challenging resource system (but a very fair one). Tons of units and focus on strategy, not tactics (like most other RTS that are much smaller scale and deal with mere 40 to 80 units)Uses second monitor as a map screen, game maps range from 5 to 5 km squared to 80 by 80 km huge spaces.This game has a realistic balance between offensive units and defensive units: i.e. unlike most other RTSes, you can actually defend a position with ground based defenses.Contains 4 Tech levels: Tech 1 to 3, plus experimentals, which are super huge units that are more powerful than any other units and take a long time to build. This game is NOT for casual gamers, it takes dedication and learning to handle it. But once you do, it is incredible fun, especially against other human players (AI is boring) Game playtimes range from 10 minutes (rare) to 2 hours. An average interesting game is probably 30 to 50 mins. Like in real war, a lot of time is spend building your army and preparing an assault, it is not focused on mindless nonstop fighting.

												Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance honestly is tied with Supreme Commander 2 in my opinion. This game provides variety of units, buildings and structures. There are more units in this game then SC2, and better experimentals. For a 2008 video game, this game has pretty good graphics. I really enjoy the way how buildings go from Tech 1 to Tech 3. This game has its own unique ways then SC2. The maps are wayyyy bigger in this game then the rest of the games in the franchise. I recommend not only buying this game, but buying the rest of the franchise as well!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I must say that Supreme  Commander Forged alliance is somewhat more interesting than Supreme Commander, Mostly because it is reminisent of a much older game that some probably don't remember, which I played quite often. ""Total Annihilation"", which I still have in my cd collection, Also reminds me of another old out of production game, command and conquer. I am not sure if you can get either of these on steam anymore. As for giving reviews? I am not that good at it, So I will leave the rest to someone, else. Try it, you'll Like it.			",4,0,0,0,2,0,11

												how fitting that the first review I write on steam would be for the first game that I played on PC.All I can say is that its damn good, and I suck at it in PVP. The fact that I can say that I suck at PVP is in its self a testament to this games greatness. The official multiplayer is dead, GPG net died a long time ago, but there is a community driven client that you can download that not only patches and adds content to the game through mods but also has competitive ranking. This client is known as Forged Alliance Forever, google it, love it (you do need this game installed to use FAF).Pros: - Have fun nuking all the things and rolling over your friends/enimies with giant units- The multi-player that livedCons: - Some possible performance issues for lack of multi-threading due to the games age, this is only really evidednt with lots of things going on.

												You might say: “Why should I get this game, instead of planetary annihilations?”Well, you should get this game because of how fun it is to play alone, or with friends! Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance redefined the RTS genre, letting you build an army of thousands of units ranging from submersible aircraft carriers to experimental nuclear missile launchers.If you do get this game, then use the Forged Alliance Forever launcher (or FAF, you can find it on google), it fixes a lot of bugs and the community over there is really active!Note: If this game will run on pretty much any decent CPU, but it can only use one core (or thread)! The framerate will not drop but the actions in game will take much longer to perform (time goes slower towards the end of battles because of this) Again, the FAF launcher found a way to work around this limitation, making the game much more playable when there are a lot of things happening ingame.

												This is my all-time favorite RTS game. I really dislike having to micro-manage units at the level that games like Starcraft II require you to (are my soldiers that stupid?), but in Supreme Commander, macro-management is king and overall strategy is more important, as well as economy management. Check out faforever.com to get a free multiplayer client that receives regular updates (support for the official multiplayer servers was discontinued).The depth and awseomeness of this game is off the charts. I can't even play RTS games without strategic zoom anymore. Definitely worth a buy!			",51,5,0,4,11,0,16

												A great addition to an already great game. They've improved on the resource system and game speed making games faster and less of a waiting for constructions. The addition of a new race, new units for the original ones, new campaign and even little new tweeks from older unit gives a new experience from this great game. Plus its always nice to see one (or several) nuclear explosions on the map.			",143,12,0,25,4,0,23

												Oh how I've longed for such a challenge.After having played countless skirmishes in the original Supreme Commander I longed for a challenge. I downloaded the Forged Alliance, and my wish was furfilled.The first campaign mission is merciless and incredibly hard, took me 2 hours to complete it. I am a slow attacker, so that is no surprise. The easy skirmish enemy is quite competent too, so you're going to have to put everything you can into actually defeating it.Looking for a well made RTS game that proves challenging? Buy this, and you won't waste your money.			",121,17,1,22,14,1,27

												According to me, this is the best real time strategy game ever published:- awesome economy system- base layout really matters- real ballistic trajetory calculation- very nice flavour-designed factions- astonishing experimental units- land, air and navy battles form a whole- immersive 360' strategic approach and not monkey-on-steroids-fast-pressing-to-winIndeed strongly recommended.

												Great game that is a fitting stand-alone/add-on to one of the most inspired sequels (yes I know IP limitations) to the greatest RTS ever made (Total Annihilation).This game captures the epicness of TA and doubles down on it.  It is massive and rediculously fun.  Both in single player and multiplayer.  One of the games that will leave you wanting more each and evertime you play it.  While not the greatest game ever made it is a pile of fun every time you hear.. ""Nuclear Launch Detected""My Score: 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can without a doubt say that this is the best RST game I have ever played in my life so far. I have played a lot of video games in my life so far, and this is one of my all time favorites!If you are looking for a great RTS game, this is definitely it!However beware that the game is from 2007 (not 2011) and is no longer supportet by any game developer team or publisher.Sadly there are not many players who play this game anymore, so there are little to no servers available at most times.This game is still great to play with your friends though.I have spent countless hours playing the game before it arrived on steam. One of the greatest games ever if you ask me!Also! Stay the hell away from ""Supreme Commander 2"". It's terrible and does not do the Supreme Commander franchise justice! ",131,22,4,8,13,1,16

												Absolutely love this game. I have played it for years prior to getting it on Steam. Anyway, just here to let people know that if you're a die hard fan like me, you should get the BlackOps Mods. You can always just turn them off in game if you don't like them, but I doubt that will be the case. They are: BlackOpsACUs, BlackOpsEXUnits, BlackOpsNavalBalance, BlackOpsUnleashed. - These Mods are extrmemely well done, to the extent of not even being able to tell where the original game ends, and these Mods begin. Highlights include new units in every tech level which alter play strategies, and new experimentals which balance the races. About half of the new experientals are superior to the orginal games experimentals. My favorite addition though is what they did to the ACUs. Through a massive restructure, you can upgrade commanders through each tech level up to experimental level. Ever want your ACU to stand toe to toe with a colossus? Well, now you can. I would also recommend getting Sorian_AI_Mod_2.1.2. - This almost doubles the amount of AI to choose from when selecting which AI to fight against in skirmish or multiplayer missions, and at its peak, adds a level of difficulty far superior to the original game, guaranteed to challenge even the most veteran players.

												personal favourite & best rts to date; reference for any competitor.there isn't a single newer title, yet able to hold a candle to it.why?mainly due to the economy concept. you can set up production cycles, no matter how many ressources you got. out of ressources: production stops. this  leads to 'unified approaches' in early game, for sure, but so does chess.2.: scale. you can easily play a huge map over a week or weekend (and save); you can as well rush the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of each other in best c&c style. it pretty much supports the playstyle you like. be a giant turtle, a tick.. what ever.3.: tactics. the game comes with an intuitive command chain style. be it base building, patrols, seek & destroy. plan it, execute it, get kicked in the nuts, start over.4.: mods.if you never played supcomFA, you missed the greatest rts after Total Anihilation.

												Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is the type of Real Time Strategy game that plays well with old-school strategy gamers, requiring players to spend hours of sweat, blood, and tears before they can deploy their fleets of lumbering robots against their foe. SC:FA has great tactical depth and fetches a fair amount of complex resource-management and army organization, yet bears enough sheer RTS joy to appease both more casual and hard-core RTS gamers alike. With SC:FA’s blend of generic alien vs man sci-fi action thrown in with the politics of the previous game’s 3 human factions, the game also concocts a pretty enjoyable storyline to campaign with. The best way, I feel, to evaluate the game is to compare it to the more modern successor, Supreme Commander 2. SC2 has all the trappings of a modern RTS sci-fi product; flying, creeping, and hovering robots of all shapes and sizes zipping around a well sculpted battlefield, brightly colored lasers and missiles flying about under the player’s direction. Being of the same company and storyline, each game uses the same two resources and the same style of base building (with the usage of shields, turrets, and factories that produce everything from small tanks to submarine-aircraft carriers). The storyline of SC2 isn’t as important nor as interesting, but what makes both games stand out as frontrunners of the two different RTS genres is the differing styles of tactical gameplay and resource gathering.Instead of varying sizes of landmasses, such as in SC:FA in which it can take twenty minutes for fuel-thirsty aircraft to reach the end of the map, SC2 possesses much smaller maps, where even the slowest units take no more than five minutes to reach point B. In terms of tactical management, aircrafts of all factions in SC:FA need refueled at specialized staging facilities. This isn’t relevant in SC2, with aircraft being able to fly over targets and friendly bases indefinitely. Also, a notable difference rests in the building of what is known in both games as “experimental units” or just unique units that are the culmination of your particular faction’s military genius (for example, the United Earth Federation’s Fatboy landship). The Fatboy unit in SC:FA can cross over water, possesses shields and anti-aircraft capabilities, and has very powerful guns, all at the cost of twenty minutes of time. However, in SC2, the Fatboy unit only wields the large guns, with all other abilities missing, giving the unit a much cheaper cost at a three minute production rate. These examples serve to set apart the two different RTS styles; the newer version represents how tactical depth and patience have been replaced by spectacle and awe.To conclude, if you’re the type of gamer that likes to spend loads of time setting the pieces up in order to get to the nuclear explosions, then this is the game for you. (Disclamer-I bought the steam version to replace a lost disc version I used to have. So more like 10 hours on record)			",10,2,0,0,6,0,11

												Forged Alliance is a stand-alone expansion to the first Supreme Commander, and is basically 100% better than Supreme Commander - to the point where you really should only buy Forged Alliance.I have a few gripes with this game - the four races are a little too samey for my taste, and your units still do that stupid thing where a perfect square formation given a move command will slowly stretch out into a vulnerable line as it moves - but overall, it's a very enjoyable RTS for those willing to invest some time into learning its mechanics.

												I grew up with SupCom 1 and 2 for Xbox 360... 1 was always the better game, but it had way too many bugs.  When I came over to PC, I found that there was an expansion to 1 (Forged Alliance) - I love it!  I bought this as a bundle with the first one since it's only $5 more to get both - The first one is only realy worth it if you want to know the full story.If you like C&C series, I highly reccomend - same great sci-fi RTS visuals, but WAY more freedom!

Awesome technology, nice campaign (and actually fun to replay in hard mode). Awesome multiplayer - huge guns, tanks, aircrat, battleships - in short everything a boy would want. Sound is brilliant. If you liked Total Annihilation, C&C etc, this is for you. SC2 is also fun, but SC1 is KING. Very nice mods available too.			",130,7,1,19,35,0,40

												Hello!Ahhhh, Supreme Commander, specifically Forged Alliance. I grew up on several games, this being one of them. It is definitely one of the greatest RTS’s I have ever seen. Basically, there are two ways one can play this game, rushing or turtling. But when you add that a wide variety of maps, factions, units, tech trees, and complex AI’s that break your face in with ARMIES UPON ARMIES OF T1 TANKS!?!? It gets pretty darn fun. Graphics are amazing for a game released in 2007, the units mix well with the terrain, and the overlay is perfect. Mechanics are pretty perfect, everything is pretty balanced, and there are plenty of options for stuff in the custom lobby.Price is perfect, the expansion Forged Alliance is a must get, and it is the TRUE sequel to SupCom, not SupCom 2 made by Square Enix.A great recommendation, the learning curve may be a slight bit steep, but this game is a must-have for anybody starting an adventure into RTS Games.~Wolfy ",70,10,0,10,19,1,21

												This is one of the best RTS games as of 2015. When it launched it was an incredible resource hog as it suggested 2 monitors and required a great deal more processing power than most people had. It is a beautiful game overall and the balance is quite good. The ability to make massive super weapons is a real joy because they are quite powerful but they take a long time to build and can be a gamble if the enemy blows them up before they are finished.This game is oldschool in the sense that it doesn't have cheating AI that always knows exactly what you're doing. It will build the tech 3 radar that has a massive detection range... but that's a structure you can build as well. (you can always blow it up or take out his power to turn it off). This game has a slight degree of technicality with your base setup (the wiki can explain it very quickly with a picture). Long story short you can put power plants next to factories and each will reduce the cost of things you build in the factories. The other game resource, mass, will also reduce building costs if you build a factory on top of a mass extractor (often called a mex). The danger with this is that a tight network of touching/linked buildings is more effecient but it is much easier to destroy because power plants are volitile,The bad news is that the AI can't really compete very well on water maps. The AI is also somewhat weak to turtle strategies involving large defensive structure batteries. However one of the interesting aspects of this game is that you kinda need to learn which thing to build to counter what your opponent is building. Did I mention that anything you send at the enemy's base that gets destroyed can have the mass reclaimed by the enemy?One more bit of bad news is that I don't think a lot of people play so you'll probably be playing against the AI. That being said the AI is a good opponent. There is a built in ""cheater"" option if you want to play against a crazy tough AI opponent who will always be 1-2 steps ahead of you. This is a really good game and the first time you see a nuclear missile hit the enemy base you will really be in for a treat. If you hear the words strategic launch detected and don't have countermeasures built you'll be in trouble.This is one of those games you can play for hundreds of hours and never feel like you're still playing to get your money's worth.

												For a 4 year old title, SC:FA has aged extremely well.Still probably the best RTS I've played (a genre that sadly seems to be dying), and easily one of my favorite games in general.Pros:- Great variety of units, both in numbers and utility.- Excellent controls/UI/minimap system, makes handling massive numbers of units simple and intuitive.- ♥♥♥♥ing huge battles, there can be literally thousands of units on the field.- Detailed building and unit models/animations.Cons:- Build times on some things can be painfully long.- Story is kind of forgettable, and a little hard to follow.- Outdated graphics (though they really aren't so bad that it detracts from the game).(P.S. Avoid Supreme Commander 2, it is a massive letdown.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the greatest RTS games I've ever played. The scale is breathtaking and epic, fighting hundreds of enemy units with hundreds of your own. The story mode is excellent, through there are only 6 missions, you can play them a variety of ways and each progresses in a way that will leave you starstruck by just how amazing it all is. I personally play as the UEF, and there is nothing I like more than steam rolling iwth a fatboy or two and watching them crush everything they encounter. This game is utterly amazing, I'd buy it again just for the experience. 10/10			",208,27,5,18,22,2,17

												This is one of the best games I have ever played BUT....... Chrise Taylor was telling a whole bunch of lies when in an interview he once said that this game was future proof, it does not use all cpu cores correctly, in fact it only uses one core of my i7 4790k effectively, thats ok when playing on my computer in campaign mode, but when it comes to playing multiplayer games, this is where this otherwise brilliant game comes tumbling to a halt. this games begins to slow down within half an hour of playing on a 20 x 20 map with 6 players and a unit count of 1,000, so big eppic games are out the window in reality, I do recoment this game for anyone who loves rts games, mainly for its single player mode and not the Multiplayer.

												This is a super awesome RTS. The economy is really difficult to get a handle on, but once you get used to it, start to see how it all fits together, and then start implementing those newfound skills, it feels immensely rewarding. It also blows balls when a bomber takes out one power generator that's connected to an entire grid of power generators and your entire base goes black, just before a different enemy sends in an experimental unit to wreak havok. But those are also the kind of moments in the game that makes it special. There's something oddly amazing about playing defense, but not so much in terms of using units, but rather resource management to make sure your sheild generators don't drop. It feels like a strangely realistic version of over the top sci-fi warfare. On the one hand, you can just spam light units like the Ruskies, or you can focus on developing base defense and researching up to higher-tech units. The crazy thing is that this game doesn't really focus on a ""rock-papers-scissors"" balancing form, as even if one player has tons of low level units, if an opposing player brings in two experimentals, the other player is essentially screwed. The scale of the maps is big enough for large-scale strategies, and the games are long enough to actually develop them over time. It's just... It's unique, and I mean that in a good way.

												An Awesome game, having played the first game, i wasn't surprised as much by the lack of a learning curve. I just jumped in, got to building and blew the enemy away. And by building i mean i took my time, i built formidable bases. Then built me an army and or fleet, to take the first objective, but before taking that i built more armies and or fleets, so i had some left over for when the map expanded. You do not want to get caught without those forces when the final and biggest enemy base finally appears on your map. You must take your time and you must fortify your whole base, lack of proper defenses will have the enemy dropship troops onto your doorstep and blow your infra structure to smithereens. Rushing will lead to you being overwhelmed by the forces the enemy had stockpiled. You'll know what i mean once 4 experimentals are marching towards your base and you don't have anything to stop them with. The story isn't much, just a little something to hang the action onto, but it's okay.  Visiually it does what is neccesary, allowing vast armies to clash and lovely explosions to cover the field from left to right. I get a blast from seeing nukes going off over the enemies productions centers. Special mention should be made of the AI, while not genius level. It did target my radar early on so its attacks would  be more of a surprise, line of sight then being the criteria for a lot of units to shoot despite their range. And it took particular offense to my building the experimental building that would have ended my economic needs. It got bombed conventionally twice as i was building it and actually launched a nuke at it for attempt number three. For me, the whole base building and taking my time is what makes, RTS so much fun. Spending two hours a mission is nothing. (for me anyway)			",59,17,0,25,8,0,24

												If I could, I would give this game 3 thumbs up!<<<PLAY-TIME HOUR COUNT>>>I know Steam says I have twenty-two minutes play-time but that's a bit shy of the actual number. I bought this game retail when it first came out many years ago and have played so many hours I've lost track. With many years of playing, I would estimate my hour count in the thousands. I still use my retail copy so have no real need to use the Steam version. The only reason I installed it was because Steam says I need to play five minutes before I can review.  Anyway, on to what you came here for...the review, enjoy :).<<<OVERVIEW>>>Chris Taylor knew what he was doing on this one (unlike Supreme Commander 2 :P). It was way ahead of its time in graphics. It excels in the use of varied factions and the diversity of their units. No two games are the same; you can play a game with the same exact settings and have a completely different outcome.<<<VISUALS>>>You may think that because this game is old is lacks in good graphics or up-to-date features. I can assure you this is not the case. This game rests safely in my top five strategy games of all time even to this day. The graphics are still quite stunning due to the fact that it was very resource-heavy when it came out. They didn't skimp on models, textures and animations.<<<FEATURES>>>The tactical features are second-to-none.> For example, the use of groups include the ability to move in formation and move-fire.> You can save several camera positions and recall/alter/delete them at will for quick camera movement across even very large maps.> You can use both split screen and dual monitors in any combination.> The ability to queue up builds and save templates makes it very easy to setup your base ahead of time and go fight/build/scout somewhere else on the map while it's getting built.> You can name landmarks and units for easy identification even at a distance.> There are several different ping command types which your AI allies will respond to.There are many different features and key/mouse combos, so many in fact, that after over twelve years of playing, I'm still finding a new one now and then.<<<LEARNING THE GAME>>>Be Warned!This is not a game for n00bs. If you think you're gonna walk in and pwn because you've played StarCraft, you've got another think coming. It's light years ahead of kiddie games like that. While you should be efficient in your building, victory has nothing to do with Clicks Per Minute. SupCom:FA is for serious strategy/tactic junkies. The sheer map size and unit/faction variation makes weeding out the click-kiddies from actual strategists/tacticians a very simple task. A good rule of thumb is, if you don't have the ability and patience to play chess, you probably won't like this game.This game has a fairly steep learning curve; if, for nothing else, for efficiency in shortcut-key/key-combo features.It is not a typical triad-based unit type game either. The factions are given different strengths and weaknesses and the player will have to play to those strengths and take advantage of his opponent's faction's weaknesses. The factions are intentionally unbalanced to create a genuine variation in games, play-styles, over-all strategy and tactics.<<<MODDING>>>While you can enjoy this game vanilla, I would highly recommend modding it. There are many mods out there for it and you would benefit from many of them. You don't have to learn to mod if you don't want to, just install the existing ones you want. ""Forged Alliance Forever"" is a great group dedicated to keeping this game alive. There are many resources available for you with a quick google search. All mods are written in LUA and the base unit script archives can be treated as zips if you want to do some modding yourself. There are wikis out there to help you if you're up for it. The details you can adjust are granular going all the way to salvo size, reload rates and gun barrel turn radius to name only a few. Even game settings and UI can be modded.NOTE: be sure, if you're playing with mods, that whoever you play with has the exact same files or the game will desync. UI mods don't count, you can use as many of these as you like without anyone else needing them.<<<FINAL NOTES>>>If you mod this properly, you can enjoy thousands of hours of fun; I know I have and still do :D. Give it a try, you won't regret it.			",165,21,2,28,22,1,47

												There are other RTS games that are closer to my heart and that I've had more fun with, but I have to admit that this is probably the best RTS ever made, and still one of the best PvP RTS games to play in 2015 if you install the 3rd party FAF (Forged Alliance Forever) client (requires valid steam or cd copy).Epic pretty much sums up this game, as you will be amazed by the great designs (looks better than not only all games from the same time period, but most RTS games that were released the next 10 years as well), massive battles, more than enough units and awesome hero (commander) mechanics that make this game playable in two or three completely different ways. The economy system is also slightly different than other games, and challenges you a lot more to play as well as you can, but is also very forgiving if you design it to be (with minimal economic loss).As long as you play the tutorial it's not very hard getting into the basics of the game, but after a douzen games there might be some things you still haven't figured out and won't either for the next 100 games. Look around, try every button and you will find this game has a lot of good mechanics and features you don't see in a lot of games.The game engine, however, is slightly limited and if you set the total unit cap too high in games with more than 3-4 players it will slow down. 75%, 50% or even 20% game speed is common for games of decent size. There's fewer people who have an issue with this than people who don't, but it's worth keeping in mind when you buy the game. To play with 3000 units on the same map you will have to make compromises.The story is great though, and combined with a multiplayer that will have you playing every map twice or more it would have been worth buying for many times more than what it costs on Steam on full price.If you have ever enjoyed any RTS game, you HAVE TO buy this game!

												The best RTS on the block. Massive battles with units ranging from tiny robots to huge battle-changing experimental robots that cut giant swaths of destruction in their path. Units are balanced against each other but not in a 'rock/paper/scissors' fashion but tiered. Upper tier units can be defeated by superior numbers but lower tier units pack less of a punch. The interface is also fantastic, allowing you to program long strings of build commands, attack commands, coordinated attacks, patrol commands, etc... You can even save good build plans you like so you can use them again in later games. Forged Alliance added new units and while it's an expansion, it DOES NOT REQUIRE SUPREME COMMANDER. It will run on its own containing everything in Supreme Commander. And don't bother with Supreme Commander 2. We don't speak of its heretical existence. SupCom:FA is the alpha and the omega.

												personal favourite & best rts to date; reference for any competitor.there isn't a single newer title, yet able to hold a candle to it.why?mainly due to the economy concept. you can set up production cycles, no matter how many ressources you got. out of ressources: production stops. this  leads to 'unified approaches' in early game, for sure, but so does chess.2.: scale. you can easily play a huge map over a week or weekend (and save); you can as well rush the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of each other in best c&c style. it pretty much supports the playstyle you like. be a giant turtle, a tick.. what ever.3.: tactics. the game comes with an intuitive command chain style. be it base building, patrols, seek & destroy. plan it, execute it, get kicked in the nuts, start over.4.: mods.if you never played supcomFA, you missed the greatest rts after Total Anihilation.

												Absolutely love this game. I have played it for years prior to getting it on Steam. Anyway, just here to let people know that if you're a die hard fan like me, you should get the BlackOps Mods. You can always just turn them off in game if you don't like them, but I doubt that will be the case. They are: BlackOpsACUs, BlackOpsEXUnits, BlackOpsNavalBalance, BlackOpsUnleashed. - These Mods are extrmemely well done, to the extent of not even being able to tell where the original game ends, and these Mods begin. Highlights include new units in every tech level which alter play strategies, and new experimentals which balance the races. About half of the new experientals are superior to the orginal games experimentals. My favorite addition though is what they did to the ACUs. Through a massive restructure, you can upgrade commanders through each tech level up to experimental level. Ever want your ACU to stand toe to toe with a colossus? Well, now you can. I would also recommend getting Sorian_AI_Mod_2.1.2. - This almost doubles the amount of AI to choose from when selecting which AI to fight against in skirmish or multiplayer missions, and at its peak, adds a level of difficulty far superior to the original game, guaranteed to challenge even the most veteran players.

												The pinnacle of RTS. All units have their place in the game, and FA:F keeps the game alive. No race is completely overpowered, but have their strengths in certain areas, like UEF turtling with T3 point defense or Aeon ASF's. The maps feel extremely spacey and the units are scaled appropriately. Where applicable, bullet time is simulated and projectiles travelling at something can miss. Nukes can collide with air units, for instance, as far as I'm aware.I would completely reccomend this to anyone wwanting to get into RTS or anyone who enjoys RTS.			",76,3,4,3,17,0,10

												Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is the type of Real Time Strategy game that plays well with old-school strategy gamers, requiring players to spend hours of sweat, blood, and tears before they can deploy their fleets of lumbering robots against their foe. SC:FA has great tactical depth and fetches a fair amount of complex resource-management and army organization, yet bears enough sheer RTS joy to appease both more casual and hard-core RTS gamers alike. With SC:FA’s blend of generic alien vs man sci-fi action thrown in with the politics of the previous game’s 3 human factions, the game also concocts a pretty enjoyable storyline to campaign with. The best way, I feel, to evaluate the game is to compare it to the more modern successor, Supreme Commander 2. SC2 has all the trappings of a modern RTS sci-fi product; flying, creeping, and hovering robots of all shapes and sizes zipping around a well sculpted battlefield, brightly colored lasers and missiles flying about under the player’s direction. Being of the same company and storyline, each game uses the same two resources and the same style of base building (with the usage of shields, turrets, and factories that produce everything from small tanks to submarine-aircraft carriers). The storyline of SC2 isn’t as important nor as interesting, but what makes both games stand out as frontrunners of the two different RTS genres is the differing styles of tactical gameplay and resource gathering.Instead of varying sizes of landmasses, such as in SC:FA in which it can take twenty minutes for fuel-thirsty aircraft to reach the end of the map, SC2 possesses much smaller maps, where even the slowest units take no more than five minutes to reach point B. In terms of tactical management, aircrafts of all factions in SC:FA need refueled at specialized staging facilities. This isn’t relevant in SC2, with aircraft being able to fly over targets and friendly bases indefinitely. Also, a notable difference rests in the building of what is known in both games as “experimental units” or just unique units that are the culmination of your particular faction’s military genius (for example, the United Earth Federation’s Fatboy landship). The Fatboy unit in SC:FA can cross over water, possesses shields and anti-aircraft capabilities, and has very powerful guns, all at the cost of twenty minutes of time. However, in SC2, the Fatboy unit only wields the large guns, with all other abilities missing, giving the unit a much cheaper cost at a three minute production rate. These examples serve to set apart the two different RTS styles; the newer version represents how tactical depth and patience have been replaced by spectacle and awe.To conclude, if you’re the type of gamer that likes to spend loads of time setting the pieces up in order to get to the nuclear explosions, then this is the game for you. (Disclamer-I bought the steam version to replace a lost disc version I used to have. So more like 10 hours on record)			",10,2,0,0,6,0,11

												If you are deciding between PA or the new PA: TITANS and this. BUY THIS GAME NOW WITHOUT HESITATION! JUST, TRUST ME! I know on Steam it says I only have a few hours, well that's because I only recently rebought the game through Steam. I have owned the game in the box since 2006, back when it was worth $100 retail, and played countless hours on both Supreme Commander and the Forged Alliance standalone.Supreme Commander and Supereme Commander: Forged Alliance are the games that inspired PA, and unlike PA, Supreme Commander has enthralling stories and campaigns. And it most importantly, has personality. PA is lifeless and has 1 shared faction across all players. Supreme Commander Forged Alliance has 4 factions, each unique and screaming personality and lore. With their own advantages and disadvantages.UEF is the all around balanced faction, it posses no real advantages over the other factions. But has no real disadvatnages on that note either.Cybran Nation is a strong early, weak middle and strong again late game faction (early being as far as 30 minutes in depending on gamemode, map and players). They have superior land tech and some of the cheapest units in the game. They output allot of damage at the expense of low health across all their units.Aeon Illuminate is a weak early, OK middle and Extreme late game faction. Aeon Illuminate posses the most powerful experimentals (note: experimentals are no longer game winners in Forged Alliance, they are just game changers.) Although their units take a very long to produce they pay off with extreme damage and high health.Seraphim was added in the Forged Alliance standalone, they are a mix of the UEF and Aeon Illuminate, in my opinion. They have no real advantage or disadvantage, they just added new life to the game. They do have extremely powerful and expensive experimentals, and have the one true game ending experimental left, the experimental nuke. The Seripham have effective land and air experientals too, but the experiemental nuke is on the list of the most feared experimentals in the game.Keep in mind, each faction has it's own ""game ending"" experimental, but they are always super expensive. And can take upwards of 40 minutes real time to complete if you're efficent and have the builders to assist.Machanics: 10/10Story: 10/10Personality: 10/10Multiplayer: 5/10 - It works, but you need a program called ""game ranger"". When the game was released it was too CPU/Network expensive to do anything but LAN at the time.Multiplayer with Game Ranger: 10/10total: 45/50BUY IT!			",141,18,1,9,15,0,20

												Great game. The giant battles are awesome but the game's simulation starts to slow down when there are lots of units, especially on the large maps.The campaign levels are quire lengthy, taking between 1 to  2 1/2 hours each depending on strategies and difficulties. The skirmish AI can derp out a bit on lower difficulties, espcially on naval focused maps in which it mass builds land units but higher difficulties spam all 3 types (land, sea and air). Never let the harder AIs get nukes or it is gg.			",271,27,3,33,60,1,66

												I've put a decent amount of hours into this game, both on campaign and otherwise. I was introduced to it by a friend, and I am glad I was. This is by far one of my favorite RTS games, and I completely reccomend it to anyone who is familiar with the Supreme Commander game series, or just for RTS game fans in general. You do not need prior knowledge of the games to enjoy this one.			",57,0,0,8,8,0,4

												Dont look at this 2h game time. I've spent a lot in this game before i bought it on Steam.For me this is the best RTS I've ever played. The reasons for this are:- Epic battles. Thousands of units of different size and shape on land, water and in the air. Battle between huge armies look really massive and epic.- Great economy model. Buildings receive different bonuses from resource buildings nearby, encouraging you to plan your base's architecture. The game also has build/uprade assistance from constructors and reclamation.- Micro doesnt play a major role, unlike in Starcrafts and other popular RTS tiles, where the winner is the one who does more clicks per second.- Fractions seem alike a the first glance, but the small differences in unit's capabilities, like being amphibious, or having a shield, can become a huge advantage if used properly.- Epic experimental units, capable of defeating small armies alone. They are all different and unique.- Many small things that make the game comfortable, like building queues/plans, possible building distribution between factories, automated unit transportation from assembly point to te battlefield and many others.The only reason this game is a little forgotten is it's complexity. To bad it became a disadvantage in modern gaming world.			",30,0,2,6,2,0,4

												Supcom will forever hold a place in my heart, as well as whatever disk space it needs.  Everyone has their ""top 5 games of all time"" list and this will remain on that list for the rest of my gaming life.  Since I first watched it in development to today, I have never stopped trumpeting just how amazing it really is.  I never miss a chance to try and convince every gamer I know to buy it.  I think I have donated at least five copies to my friends just to have them experiance it.Nearly every RTS before and after have been about just tanks and infantry in small teams... Maybe 100 units at the very most.  Air was usually limited to planes that magically hover in the air and shoot at things until they ran out of ammo, and navy, if present at all, was far less effective than it should really be.  Nuclear weapons and WMD's in Command and Conquer or Starcraft would maybe kill a dozen units and destroy a couple buildings if placed properly.  Nukes in Supcom incinerate everything on the screen, as they absolutly should.Supcom went beyond the level of being a video game and truly pushing the idea of a simulation.  Much like Steel Battalion or high end flight simulators, this game is less a game than it is an experiance.  High APM click-fests (Starcraft) are lauded as the best of the best in the unfairly small RTS genre, but relied far less on tactics and strategy than they did a small group (or in some cases, an individual unit) winning a single battle which mostly judged the outcome of the game.  Supcom recognized that warfare takes a long time, and even the fastest battles are often an attrition match.  The smallest fights often involve dozens of units on each side, with the largest brawls involving hundreds of tanks, artillery support from a secondary line, dozens of aircraft bombing the ground forces and fighting the other aircraft, and fire support from naval units miles away.  This is why Supcom will always stand out as the premier RTS of all time... it is the only one to recognize that there is more to it than a few tanks at a time... Ground air and sea work in conjunction to support eachother.If you have never played this game before, you are truly missing out.  It is something that everyone needs to experiance.  There likely will never be anything else like it.  Even for an 8 year old game, it still looks and sounds amazing.  Nothing else has ever truly given the scale of a warfare simulation like Supcom does.  It is however, punishingly difficult to learn.  There is so much nuance to this game, that people often develop a misconception that the races are too similar when they first learn to play.  It isin't until a deep understanding of the game is reached does the vast differences between the factions becomes realized.  Each side has subtle differences that measure not just the raw stats of the units, but the entire playstyle and even the lore-based philosophy of the faction.  Finally, you can't fanboy this game without mentioning the amazing community of FAF.  It took over running everything when GPG went down.  That so much support exists for a game this old and largely un-mainstream speaks more for it's merits than I ever could.  If you are still unsure of this game being worth checking out, please visit the FAF site at: http://www.faforever.com/ ",56,3,0,13,4,0,15

												After you buy this game, (which if you haven't already, what's taking you so long) head over to faforever.com, a community lobby built by the SupCom community. It is ~10,000 members strong, with a competition ladder, up to 6v6 custom matches, a dozen+ mods, galactic war, the campaigns of SupCom and Forged Alliance redone to allow up to 4 player co-op, and more. It's free and adds far more to this game than any other RTS on the market.Hands down the best RTS game available. This game really does things right by focusing on the obliteration of your opponents through sheer force of strength and easy economy management. Don't like the tediousness of micro-managing your economy and just want to throw hundreds of units constantly at each other? Are you annoyed that you have to wait until you have resources stockpiled before you can build units? Want to build massive units to wipe your enemies off the face of the earth? Do you enjoy being able to specialize in either land, air, or naval units, or use combinations of each? This game is what you're looking for. Now the only question is, what are you waiting for?

												A complete masterpiece, and the mark of one of the greatest RTS games ever created. If you know your history then you are aware that the RTS genre was very popular from the late 90's to mid 2000's, this is also the time slot when some of the best games in the genre were made, like age of empires 2 and company of heroes. However when it comes to destroying other factions on a massive scale no other game even comes close. With the original supreme commander being good, but not great, and the sequal being a total cash grab by square, this game remains the best in the series and I only wish that creative assembly the strategy giant, would buy the rights to a third game. Maybe then the franchise would get the treatment that it truly deserves.			",109,15,1,14,21,0,35

												This game was on my radar when supreme commander was still in beta.  I played ""total annillation"" back in the day, which this game is based off of.  Needless to say I couldn't wait. When this game came out in 2007 you couldn't find or build a computer that could play a game on max units/max map size.  This has kept the game very relevent even 8 years later. The most epic strategy game every made. Its just great. The AI leaves some to be desired. A single cheating AI stomps me most times, and the next step down from that I can kill like three AI's at once. So play against humans if you can. ""FA forever"" is a mod that you allows you to play mulitplayer with a  (i believe) wider community than those who play on steam servers.ALSO. If you have anything the does something tricky with your graphics settings, completely uninstall it or the game wont run at all in windows 8/8.1.. example: Virtu MVP. If you still have problems there are custom video setting ini files you can download that will help you get the game going.Furthermore, supreme commander 2 is complete garbage compared to this game.. unless you are a small child or elderly person that can't handle the complexity. lol.

												In my opinion, Forged Alliance can only be described as one of the best Real-Time RTS games of its type. Despite its age it still looks modern with high graphics settings and the addition of a 4th race to the game expands the gameplay possibility compared to the original. However the best thing about this game is the loyal community that continue support of the game with new updates and balance changes through the Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) Lobby after support for the game ceased. FAF provides the essential multiplayer this game absolutly thrives on, the game is still very competitive through the multiplayer and therefore I can also recommend Forged Alliance to seasoned veterans of the RTS genre. The game has quite a steep learning curve though and the fact that there can be 1000s of units on the battlefield means that the game can be laggy unless you have a good computer. Despite this, I think it is a brilliant title that is definitly worth your time if you have any interest whatsoever in the genre, especially as this part of the genre has very little competition.

												i recommend this game to any of you who are into commanding on the front line, or from a distance. The campaign is great besides the story you can play it at your own pase and/or build up and destroy everything in your path, aswell as the story being the usual (new race/kill it such and such) you will find that getting into the higher stages it gets challenging and you need to be more strategic than usual. I advise getting supreme commander 1 & 2 if you wanna understand the story a bit better but it is no biggie. the skirmish is spectacular, and if you want to know how to startup like the average player i recommend versing an easy bot and building your way up from there because supreme commander 2 is very differant. also the skirmish maps like the (64x64) in most cases slow up your gameplay. but setons clutch i recommend playing whatsoever can be challenging when versing a rush or adaptive bot (especially if an alx rush bot). so i guess i will give it a 8/10!

												One of the best RTS games ever made. Period. It hasn't aged a bit, you can run it well on almost any PC, and it has great native multiple screen support. People still do play it, and even though there are a few bugs that haven't been fixed in official updates, you can easily find fanmade fixes out there, as well as active competitive MP community at Forged Alliance Forever.

												one of the greatest RTS ive ever played. deciding on how to start a game is crucial. and learning how to make a good army is the difference between winning a fight and winning the war. and seeing 400+ planes swarm over your enemy base is hilarious and amazing			",51,8,0,11,13,0,21

												One of, if not the best RTS games ever made. Despite its age, this game never loses its charm and replayable nature and has some pretty awesome graphics for a 2007 game! If you have a good machine (this game is pretty hard on your CPU when there are lots of units in play) and want to see giant Spiderbots tear through enemy defenses and tanks, buy this.Also, check out FAF or Forged Alliance Forever. It offers a great multiplayer service for this game, far better than Steam's own. There are more maps, more mods and a much larger number of players to go head to head with.10/10 - Love this game.

												Although my total play time is not a lot on steam, I have put hundreds of hours into this game on Forged Alliance Forever (Check it out online, the community is keeping the game alive!). This game is a very good RTS if you are after EPIC battles between naval, land and air units. Although normal units like those play a huge part, experimental units is when the game gets epic. This game has so much replayability, considering the amount of time I have put into it (Even if it is not shown on steam). If this game goes on sale, I would highly recommend getting it, since I am yet to play an rts as much as this one! The amount of strategy this game has is very good, considering you have to maintain your units as well as a *somewhat* stable income of mass and energy. Very fun, I give this game an 8/10, considering low end pc's tend to slow down if the game goes on too long.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is real-time strategy in large scale, in all fronts: resources, technology, intelligence, air, naval, orbital, experimental, troops placement and movement, team cooperation. Your armies awaits your command. Don't mess up! Buy, install, LEARN and go play. Thank me later.			",7,7,0,0,2,0,3

												Best game I've played yet in my life, for a number of reasons.The graphics are stunning, beats any game I've played to date.The number of units to choose from are outstanding, theres around 150 constructable units to a faction, and 4 factions.The veternacy, and the requirement to build the lighter units first, really change alot of strategies, I think.The number of strategies is amazing, whether you play recon, defense, or offense, there's always action.

												Easily the best RTS I have ever played. The scale is massive but strategic zoom makes everything fairly easy to manage. There's a nice blend of macro and micro, combat and economy. The economy, by the way, is continuous, allowing for some very dynamic build orders and strategies.There is a very solid fanbase for this game and they've built their own multiplayer lobby, complete with balance patches, mods, custom maps, campaign co-ops, and much, much more. It's all very well-done and professional, so I recommend that everyone give it a look: the lobby is called 'Forged Alliance Forever' and can be downloaded for free.In the meantime, hurry up and buy this game!

												Best game of all time.Has also aged quite well and is still completely playable with a large online community.If you get it check out www.faforever.com to find online games.Why do I like this game so much?  Well it contains all the good micro and balance of small scale RTS games, but keeps scaling to an epic level where macro concepts such as battle front management becomes a thing.If you get this game, and want to play it, tell me, I will play it with you, just about any time you like :)			",139,39,1,27,41,2,48

												This game series has, and always will be my favourite set of RTS games out there, and I have never found anything that even comes close to beating it, this particular game is my favourite of the three currently out and is in general, the biggest scale strategy i have ever seen, with maps spanning a huge distance of 81 x 81 square kilometers, and huge land, sea and air battles, nothing can compete. I advise most to buy this game and I doubt you will regret it, the mechanics are great, multiplayer is awesome, and the storyline is just epic.			",128,10,9,8,13,2,30

												The expansion to Supreme Commander 1. Its standalone so you do not need Supreme Commander 1 (brownie points to devs for that). Has a 4th new faction you get to play with in skirmish/online/lan mode, AI is much tougher,new units for the 3 original factions of Supreme Commander 1. And has lots more strat abilities then the vanilla game did.A caution of warning if you have a single core processor do not get this, it requires at least 2 core to fully be enjoyed, its a slight resoure hog.

												this is the original strategy game for me. After i Seen this in a store the next town over ,bought and eventually played it i was hooked on real time strategy. Overall a great game and one that can at times be easy or extremely Difficult due to an adaptive setting and ever changing battlefield. if you want to play  multiplayer i now advise Forged alliance forever (Search it up online) as there are quite a few games with Player made maps aswell as interesting and for the most part understanding people who wont hesitate to have fun with new to multiplayer players (I wont promise all them will be understanding because every Group has its Haters and people that forget that they were once ""NOOBS"" as well). But if i had to rate this game it would be a 10/10 on my scale of awesomeness among games			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most EPIC RTS I've ever known ! Ofc I recommend it. I am compelled to. Just to bad gpg net went down, it was different back then before that happened. (it's multiplayer network/community platform) I haven't tried playing it since so I don't know how well it is supported today or how easy it is to get a match. Only annoyance I remember from this game was it's netcode, or whatever was the cause of all the connective issues that a lot of people experienced.But for the game itself ? This is...SUPREME COMMANDER.P.s. you might wanna check out FAF: 'Forged Alliance Forever' for your most enjoyment of the game. Just google/search it online and you'll find it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a VERY active community with Forged Alliance Forever.  There is a big reason why this game is still going strong after all these years:  It is the best RTS ever made.  I tried others, such as Star Craft 2, but it felt dated compared to this.  Get this game, go to Forged Alliance Forever, and download what you need to join the community.  Play skirmishes against the computer to familiarize yourself.  Go and watch videos on strategies and build orders for your base.  You won't be disappointed.  I still play this game and have never tired of it after all these years.  I am STILL learning new strategies, unit abilities, etc.  It is DEEP.			",107,5,4,7,13,1,14

												This is a super awesome RTS. The economy is really difficult to get a handle on, but once you get used to it, start to see how it all fits together, and then start implementing those newfound skills, it feels immensely rewarding. It also blows balls when a bomber takes out one power generator that's connected to an entire grid of power generators and your entire base goes black, just before a different enemy sends in an experimental unit to wreak havok. But those are also the kind of moments in the game that makes it special. There's something oddly amazing about playing defense, but not so much in terms of using units, but rather resource management to make sure your sheild generators don't drop. It feels like a strangely realistic version of over the top sci-fi warfare. On the one hand, you can just spam light units like the Ruskies, or you can focus on developing base defense and researching up to higher-tech units. The crazy thing is that this game doesn't really focus on a ""rock-papers-scissors"" balancing form, as even if one player has tons of low level units, if an opposing player brings in two experimentals, the other player is essentially screwed. The scale of the maps is big enough for large-scale strategies, and the games are long enough to actually develop them over time. It's just... It's unique, and I mean that in a good way.
