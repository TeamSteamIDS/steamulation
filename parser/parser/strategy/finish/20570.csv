												INTRODUCTION:Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II Chaos Rising, is the first expansion pack to the Dawn of War II RTS game by Relic Entertainment. Although it uses the basic principles laid out by Dawn of War II, it adds new and interesting mechanics to the formula which makes this expansion unique in itself.The player takes the role of the 'Force Commander' from the original Dawn of War II along with his band of Space Marines. Here, one year after the Tyranid Invasion, the  capital planet of Aurelia, long lost in the Warp, has once again emerged. It is now up to the Blood Ravens to find out what vile things it has brought from the depths of the Chaos infested Warp.PROS:+ Old Formula with new Mechanics: - The expansion adds a 'Corruption' bar that measures how much your characters and soldiers are tainted by Chaos. The player will now have to be more careful on their actions since certain events carry consequences that may drastically alter the story.+ Carry Over Progress: - Rarely do I encounter a game that will allow a carry over of your save files with all (most) of your progress. Lucky for us, Chaos Rising is one such game.+ Fun new Toys: - Extended Skill Tree, New Wargear, new Squad Member(s), some new Maps (also a CON, see below), and an extended story to the Lore of the Blood Ravens will keep the players entertained as they develop new tactics and builds for their Space Marines.+ Squadmates Does not Die as easily: - This is just an observation on my part but it seems that the Squadmates of your Sergeants doesn’t die as often as they did on the original game. This is a huge bonus FOR ME, since I thought it was kinda 'wrong' that Space Marines died way to easily back in Dawn of War II.CONS:- Shameless Map Recycling: - Most of the maps from the original Dawn of War II game were heavily reused in this expansion where the devs just rotated the default camera angle 90 degrees and tried to pass  them off as new maps.- Uneven Voice / Sound Levels: - The OST was great as was the Voice Acting, but the speech sound levels were not properly leveled. Some voices play very loudly which hurts the ears, others play softly that it is drowned by the background music.- Too Short: - I found the campaign to short with fewer missions than the original game. Optional quest are a rarity which limits the possible enjoyment of Space Marine builds.- Heretics: - Filthy Chaos worshiping Heretics.CONCLUSION:GOOD EXPANSION, I like this expansion and enjoyed playing its campaign. It has expanded the lore that surrounds the Blood Ravens Chapter by adding more mystery and intrigue to an already secretive Space Marine Chapter. The new Corruption Mechanic as well as the multitude of new Wargears and expanded skill tree shall keep the players entertained with new build possibilities and tactics.It may be worth the full price for some people but seeing how short the Campaign was, I would rather have people buy it during a Sale. This is still a great game and should be bought at some point by people who liked the original Dawn of War II game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												I've beaten all 3 of the Dawn of War 2 games. They are some of the only RTS games I can enjoy, mostly due to the much lower number of units you are tasked to control. I can actually wrap my head around the tactics, whereas your StarCraft or any other just overwhelms me. The amazing graphics, audio, and dynamic combat with full destruction certainly help things.

												Chaos Rising is the first expansion to Dawn of War II(Please note: Chaos Rising can be played via Dow2, so in reality I have played more than 0.1 hours of this game)Dawn of War II: Chaos Rising takes what Dow2 did well and expanded it. It adds another race (Chaos Space Marines) and another campaign. It takes place after the first campaign, in the aftermath of the Tyranid invasion. You are minding your own buisness when suddenly evil space marines show up and start killing everyone. It is your duty to stop it. Sounds fairly easy right?Wrong.Fighting against the forces of Chaos is no easy matter, and the campaign displays this perfectly. Different actions your strike-team does affects their mental status. Letting your allies die, failing to stop an invasion, and murdering your own people cause your troops to become corrupted. Become too corrupted, and you fall to Chaos, abandoning your former battle-brothers and embracing demonic power. You can also reduce corruption by helping out around the sector, but demon powers are cooler :)Multiplayer is basically the same, but with Chaos as a playabel faction. Overall, a very solid expansion. If you enjoyed Dow2, I would recommend the sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a lovely take on the RTS genre. Instead of maintaining a base of command, you simply control a troop of heroes of your choice. For each mission, you get to chose from the classes you've unlocked so far (your force commander will always be 1 of those 4), and you plan your mission according to scout reports. After each mission you will be awarded experience as well as honor/dishonor depending on your actions on the battlefield. Both paths have their own perks that unlocks at certain intervals, and of course some gear can only be used by corrupted troopers, or ones pure in the eyes of the emperor. This is a game for RTS fans, and even more so if you like Warhammer 40k. Needless to say, I loved it.			",127,43,0,45,21,0,31

												Chaos Rising is an expansion that adds a little more content to Dawn of War 2. Chaos Rising is my least favorite of all the Dawn of War games overall, its still fun considering its a DOW game, I just feel you don't get as much ""bang for your buck"".  I feel like the additions in Chaos rising are pretty small compared to previous dawn of war expansions.  Overall I would recommend you get Chaos Rising if you are interested in continuing your Dawn of War II campaign's story, otherwise there are a good deal of Dawn of War games that are more popular, or have more content. Chaos Rising's most redeeming addition really is its branched story and multiple endings, plus save import of your previous Dawn of War 2 campaign.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

												For none-tabletop players: 9 of 10 stars.For all those of you, who love playing the mix of strategy games and RPG's, its an awesome game.You can choose a race like Space Marines (gen-manipulated super soldiers in the heaviest armors you can imagine), orkz (big, green and tons of aggression), the imperial Army ( normal humans, throw-away-units, but like a mass army, they overrun every enemy) and many others.While playing, your units gain experience and level up. So you can raise their stats and change the equipment of every hero in your squad.The game is split up in more or less 15 missions, individualized for each of the races.Otherwise you can play the ,,last stand"", where you and 2 other players try to survive 20 waves of enemys.Last aspect of the game is the multiplayer mode, where you can play solo or in team against other players.For tabletop players: 7 of 10 stars.Of course the game is still epic. But there are a few bad mistakes in the game, which let your smile disappear....Much of the equipment isn't codexconform, there are characters and Chapters that doesn't exist, an exterminatus that isn't an exterminatus ((it's an overkill in game.....first thousands of lances, and then a magmabomb which is much bigger than usual)(and although it's an planet with a great flora and fauna, there are no virusbombs)).Ok, this could be called pedantically, but if you know the codex and the rulebook, you will notice theese things wether you like or not...In spite of everything i advise you to buy this game ;)			",288,64,1,53,37,5,65

												Warhammer 40K Dawn of War 2 Chaos Rising is the standalone expansion to Dawn of War 2 and it shows in quite a lot of ways that THQ is not only capable of taking criticism, they can take that criticism and turn it into game fixes and improvements.Perhaps most notably and most importantly, the single-player campaign. No longer will you be fighting the same battles on the same maps over and over again. Now every single map is a unique entity, properly designed filled with story and gameplay triggers. Although this does mean the campaign is a good deal shorter than in Dawn of War 2 the trade-off is well worth it. Instead of getting only a couple of good missions and a ton of generic ones you now only get good quality missions. This also makes the storyline more condensed as you no longer have 5 generic missions in between every revelation and it keeps your interest up much more efficiently.The campaign meta-game continues to use the RPG elements from Dawn of War but introduces a new one, corruption. As you play through the game you will find corrupted artifacts and face gameplay choices that result in your heroes slowly turning towards Chaos if you give in to temptation. Although this mechanic is not fully realized, you can't join the forces of chaos, it does give you some interesting choices along the way and a fairly significant storyline consequence towards the end of the game.Perhaps the most immediate impact of the corrupt mechanic is the various abilities your heroes can unlock as they give in the dark influences. Although many of the abilities feel like just filler a few of them are actually powerful enough that you might opt for corrupting one of your men just to grasp that power. The corrupted weapons work much the same way, some of them being immensely superior to their regular counterparts.In terms of multi-player the situation is much as the same as in the main game, nothing has really changed except for the addition of a couple of new heroes in Last Stand. GFWL is still present as are the heavy duty matchmaking and connection issues.Graphically and sound-wise nothing has really changed either, the game still maintains a high quality in both albeit some of that might come from my infatuation with the general art and sound style of the WH40K universe.When it comes right down to it Chaos Rising is an expansion that improves significantly upon the main game and has taken several steps to correct mistakes made in the original. Although it is an expansion that focuses mostly on the single-player aspects of the game it still manages to feel like a total revival and come out looking superior in every way.

												There are many major changes in Chaos Rising coming from Dawn of War II which include newer gameplay mechanics and more varied mission map templates. Expect tougher and more cunning foes that requires better strategies and tactics to defeat. There's are new characters and a new enemy race to contend with. A new Corruption/Redemption system takes the stage towards Blood Ravens combat level advancement where the maximum level is increased to 30 from 20. The Strike Cruiser Armageddon is destroyed but the newer vessel, Retribution, will take you to view planets from its Bridge. Your squads may have special interests on certain missions. The unit customization has been improved upon, new skills and new Unique wargear written in Green, Blue, or Pink text are now added to the game. Wargear drops are random and dependent on your current level. GFWL has been removed and the game is now integrated into steam works. This game has lots of replay value - campaign, coop, last stand, multiplayer modes. I would highly recommend this game to everyone, the game is still fun in late 2014 as it was in 2010 when it was first released! ",375,79,12,35,32,3,76

												Dawn of War 2 is a wonderful tactical strategy game.  Overall, the game is terrific with the only drawback being the miniscule size of armies you're allowed.  Compared to the first installment, it seems like a step back in most areas.  Campaigns are inventive and unique, making the single player just as enjoyable as the multiplayer.  The addition of the Last Stand with Retribution makes this an amazing game.			",130,13,2,8,10,2,39

												Expansion to the original Dawn of War 2 game in which this adds a new Calamitous race known as the 'Chaos Space Marines', Includes the sorcerer and tyranid hero in Last Stand, the campaign is also extended with carry ons from the previous installment or you can choose to start a new campaign straight off the expansion and new gears and skills in the campaign. The campaign also features a new play style 'Corruption System' which allow you to use stronger powers but deserting your righteous path and the ending changes based off on how much Corruption you have received during the campaign.

												This... is the game that got me back into PC gaming. When this game came out I shoehorned a GT 8800 into an Emachine (which necessitated a new PSU, which lead to fresh RAM; which spiraled me down the dark path of building gaming rigs from the ground up).Still don't regret a red cent or a single moment spent on DoW 2 (entire franchise really). This game is a blast, a visible landmark in the evolution between RTS's and MOBA's. Many are polarized between DoW's contemporary RTS'ishness and DoW 2's smaller scale and squad based focus, but I have room in mah heart for both *doe-eyes* One tip would be: break out of your comfort zone on the campaign; beat the game, then replay it (on hard), using wargear and loadouts you normalled wouldn't, it's interesting and worth it.

												Beat single player campaign, have not touched multi-player.Absolutely LOVE this game.PositivesThe customization is great and allows for alternative play styles.The missions are engaging and require your attention, it's definitely action packed.You get rewarded for your different play styles and encouraged to try new things.The characters are likeable, and the story is great so far.You even get to learn history about the universe of 40k through the item lore, etc.BUY THIS GAME, and message me if you want to co-op.9 out of 10 stars. (only because I seldom rate 10/10.NegativesAchievements are tracked separately but for both games on the original and the expansion. Which means you need to get them twice, once in each game, which means you need to play original twice, and chaos rising twice.SO MANY HOURS...			",17,2,0,2,0,0,9

												Chaos Rising is awesome. Everything that was good about the wonderful original Dawn of War 2 is still here, along with a few tweaks, and the addition of the Chaos race.This game's campaign, though admittedly rather short, was an amazing and engaging ride through and through. The corruption mechanic allows high replayability as there are several ways the campaign itself can go, and thus, several endings,  but also the missions are quite well crafted and varied. It ties in perfectly with the vanilla game's single player story as you guide the Blood Ravens into, or away from the allure of Chaos. And although Dawn of War II's campaign was interesting, it didn't wow me nearly as much as Chaos Rising's did, so much that I now strongly recommend playing both in order. Keeping your former squadmates is a nice touch, for continuity's sake.It turned me into a fan of 40k. I want and crave more now. If you're into the unique squad based gameplay, please get Chaos Rising, it's frankly a must have expansion.			",858,258,31,163,96,14,179

												This is a good game, here's why:- It is balanced- You need to apply actual strategy (Not everyone might like this as much, but I do) - It looks difficult, but is quite easy to learn. BUT, if you are thinking of buying Chaos Rising on it's own, DONT!This is a DLC, even though it is not mentioned, you this need the full game to play the others races or campaigns, ""Dawn of War II"" or ""Dawn of War II Retribution"" I will not recommend this because,- They should mention this is a DLC before you spent € 9,99 - There is just not enough content, 1 extra campaign, 1 extra race for multiplayer  ",52,3,0,9,8,0,15

												Somewhere in between the original dawn of war and company of heroes. This game makes much better use of cover and weapon rules than the original.If you're looking for a story then, of the three DoW2 games, chaos rising has the best. If you're new to the 40k universe then there are much worse ways to get initiated than this game.If you played the original and haven't tried this one then I heartily reccommend it. the voice acting is of a higher quality (no spehss mehreens here thanks) and some crowd favorite characters make a return.Whilst DoW2 is a decent game I would reccommend getting chaos rising along with it to start.

												I have absolutely loved the Warhammer 40,000 series - I own almost all the games. The original Warhammer and Medieval: Total War are what pushed me down the deep rabbit hole of strategy games.If you like intense, action-packed squad-based strategy games, then you will absolutely love this game. Warhammer (and Total War) are easily 2 of the granddaddies of real-time strategy. I have to admit, however, that I do prefer the original Warhammer more than the sequel because that one was not entirely squad-based - it was an RTS with building management like the Age of Empires series and Rise of Nations (make buildings to train units). In this game, you do not build any structures, you only need to worry about controlling your squad members. The aesthetics are spectacular - lots of special effects and carnage. I love that your equipment is extremely varied and actually looks different when you change it with new loot you've acquired. The music and sounds are great and appropriate for the gritty theatre of war found in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The controls are not too difficult to pick up, however, if you want to be efficient then you need to become comfortable using hotkeys to maximize your micro-ing ability (you will need to rapidly use skills against your enemies and items to buff/heal you). The learning curve is moderate to difficult - you will have an advantage if you are familiar with RTS-games and/or the Warhammer franchise. If you are new, the tutorial mission is very good - and actually pretty fun even if you already know how to play.The Warhammer 40,000 universe is massive, with so much lore coming from the books (much like Star Wars {before it all got retconned =( }), and the story is very good - it continues after your actions from the previous games (including expansions). Your characters level up throughout the game, and you can invest these points into different skills, unlocking abilities and perks at particular intervals. You can also outfit them with whatever (applicable) items you may find in your adventures. If you have lots of junk items, you can also trade them for experience, which is great for helping you level up faster. During gameplay, you will do a lot of micromanaging to keep your squad alive. You will also utilize cover, flanking, and many of the skills (ex: anti-personnel grenades, warcry offensive buff) to help you survive each level. If you enjoy squad-based strategy games that offer a good challenge, give this game a try. You may also come to enjoy the expansions.Definitely recommend.			",250,88,0,51,38,2,49

												Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II Chaos Rising is a real-time strategy / tactical role-playing video game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ for Microsoft Windows based on the fictional Warhammer 40,000 universe. It is the sequel to the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War video game series.  Dawn of War II features a non-linear interplanetary campaign, as the Space Marines. The campaign can be played either as single-player or cooperatively with another player through an online connection.The game's campaign departs from those of its predecessors in several key features. One of the most notable departures is that there are no base-building elements, unlike in previous Dawn of War titles. Instead, the player chooses the units to be used prior to beginning a mission, cannot build new units once the mission begins, and has only limited reinforcement options. Has serveral multiplayer modes of play.  Adds Chaos Marine, Elves, and Tyranid avatars.Chaos Rising is set one year after the events of Dawn of War II and the defeat of the Tyranid invasion (as well as the Eldar and Ork forces) of sub-sector Aurelia. The campaign marks the return of the Blood Raven heroes from the previous game, the Chaos Lord Eliphas from Dark Crusade, Derosa as the new governor of Meridian, and the heretical Vandis.New to Dawn of War II: Chaos Rising is the Corruption System. In the campaign there are often multiple objectives which will complete a mission; depending on which one a player chooses to complete, they will become more or less corrupted.for more info:

												One part RPG, one part RTS, wrapped in a Warhammer 40k shell. It's heresy not to play this game if you're into Warhammer (or it's heresy to play this game, if you're a Chaos player like me - whatever gets you to play it).The core campaign was great, and the Chaos Rising expansion has added a lot to enrich it (while making one incredibly frustrating change to the way you resupply in battle). I haven't even touched the additional modes and I can say this is a great purchase for any WH40k fan, or for a lot of RTS players.One caveat, though - you can buy Dawn of War II: Retribution and get all the content from the core and Chaos Rising, but I can't recommend it personally, as it won't run on my computer for some reason. There's been some funny business as these games are migrated from Games For Windows servers to Steam, and that's probably the problem, but as it is I only know Chaos Rising as a safe bet.

												The only reason i downvote this is because the campaign is WAY too short and the competitive community is on retribution, i wouldnt recommend buying this expansion if you want the multiplayer experience or a single-player story as lenght as the base game. The campaign is VERY short sadly. Even though it has some new interesting corruption mechanics and ""different"" endings, its not executed properly. It was fun but it should be a lot cheaper for the content it has to offer. I do like however that you dont have to be playing useless secondary quest in order to get a better score before actually playing the main missions. If you can get this game 66% off or better then go ahead and buy it.			",142,26,1,20,5,1,32

												An expansion that refines the best parts of the core game, and gives you more options on how to play. More squads to choose from and a corruption system that affects which of the endings you can get.  Adds in cinegraphic cutscenes and more dialogue from your squad leaders.. All in all makes DoWII into a 4 star game.			",39,12,0,24,9,0,32

												The best singleplayer experience compare to vanilla Dawn of War II and Dawn of War II Retribution. The standalone DLC brings a new faction that is pretty cool looking but i still think they're not so great compare to the others factions present in the game and the choice to be good or evil in the campaign is a good addition. This is the best Dawn of War II standalone DLC in my opinion however the only problem it's the campaign leghth that's too short.			",109,1,6,6,2,0,20

												Nearly identical to the original game, Chaos rising continues where the the original left of. Adding a morale system to the game that has some interesting abilities both ways and that can change combat styles dramatically. New characters and a great story keeping the game fresh. It very short unfortunately and does not have a lot of replay value. Multiplayer gets new classes aswell and a coop horde mode fun can be very challenging. Chaos Rising adds some great things to a already great game butt lacks in some departments, for me it was gear and optional mission that was to few. It is still defianately worth it.

												An excellent expansion to an excellent game. The campign picks up the story where the first ended, and this time it's chaos forces you are up against with your Blood Ravens squad.There is an excellent corruption mechanism that really makes you fight chaos's corruption on a personal level - there are various sideobjectives that you can choose to do for usually a big item reward, for example choose to destroy the statue of a space marine hero. It also comes with corruption points, and those will slowly but surely take away your soul: your corrupting heroes and his fellow squad members will slowly lose their abilities (your saves carry over from vanilla DoW2 by the way!) and gather new demonic ones instead, along with their looks (chaos items have a corruption level requirement) and even their personality in conversations. Other side activities that are sometimes difficult, also come with corruption points - such as defending a temple the chaos forces want to destroy, and at the same time you are on a time limited objective in the other corner of the map. May you fail to defend the temple, your corruption level increases, so you are really fighting to stay pure and also constantly tempted by the power chaos offers. Because of this, there are 6 different ending to the campign that vary based on your corruption level, and the story can slightly change depending on which squad member of yours is the most pushed to the dark side.The campign is way more linear, the endlessly generated sidemissions are also gone, the open maps are gone and you are usually given one or two way of approach, though your tactics with the added corruption changes add another layer to the already big pool of tactical and character build options. There is a new ""support mage"" type of hero joining you, the buffing fireball throwing Jorah. Personally I didn't like him at all, but it's always nice to have additional characters.For multiplayer, you obviously get a new faction in the form of Chaos. Existing factions also got new units (free for all players who own DoW2 only and not this expansion), and obviously new maps with a new chaos hero for Last Stand.WHAT TO BUY CHAOS RISING FOR?If you liked vanilla Dawn of War II's campign, this is a fantastic campign expansion for it definitly worth even full price. The corruption mechanism that lingers above every mission, every man, really makes you personally fight the temping chaos that offers great power, but costs yourself.WHAT NOT TO BUY CHAOS RISING FOR?Multiplayer and Last Stand. The game's multiplayer is entirely played in the last expansion, Retribution, and because vanilla DoW2 and Chaos Rising used Games for Windows Live ( it got removed years after relase, don't worry it's full steamworks title now, just like Retribution ), the multiplayer players are separated from each other (DoW+CR and Retri are the 2 groups). Also Retribution includes everything for multiplayer, including it's new faction, and Chaos aswell without the need to own Chaos Rising.			",265,23,10,15,10,3,39

												Dawn of War II had a very mixed reception. Many wanted to keep the base-building elements of 1, even though they did not fit the 40K world at all. On the other hand, 1 became so perfect with the expansions and the patches that II was definitely a culture shock. The game is split sharply in two, with an isometric, squad-based action RPG in single player and a fast-paced RTS chess in multiplayer.Of those two personalities, the campaign was the weaker. The missions resembled one another much too much and posed very little challenge. Enemy squads could be taken out piecemeal before a slow, slow boss battle. The storyline and the Space Marine characters were interesting, however, and Chaos Rising completely fulfilled the promise of it's predecessor. In single player, all the squads level up as you play, and since there are many more possibilities than resources in the skill trees, it pays to plan forward. You also get loot drops during and after missions, and choosing who uses what requires forethought as well. The actual combat is very intense indeed, with wave after wave breaking themselves on the Emperor's Chosen. You get to retry missions and keep the loot and XP, which is possibly too forgiving, but at least some missions have a turn deadline after which they fail. The campaign also has an interesting Corruption mechanic. The best gear is corrupted by Chaos, and using them or making certain other choices will take your heroes toward power and damnation, with boons and setbacks along the way. The lore side of things is well-studied as always. If you find a powerful Heavy Bolter (a super-deadly machine gun, if you will), for example, it comes with a little lore blurb detailing how this master-crafted artifact ended the lives of hundreds of heretics and was then blessed by the priests of Terra. It is possible that lore professors are not happy but that is in their nature. The rest of us, whether it be ordinary 40K fans like me, or friends of good games in general, will enjoy Chaos Rising. Retribution perfected the multiplayer but those interested in a great single player experience should start here.			",153,47,0,24,9,1,36

												This a very good game and some interseting points would be :-lots of action like a shooter-campaign is very well done , but i would had liked more random missions that keep u busy like in the vanilla copy , which offers lots of gear collecting and selling and allows you to play in many diffrent sectors and regions in a planet and space system-campiagn has a carry over system which u can use your units from the vanilla copy ,but only if u beat it ; futhermore, you carry the equipment and ablitiles you had for the final boss battle into chaos rising , but you gian access to the equipment after you have completed the 1st mission. It set in a way wether you carry over or not the expreince from the 1st mission in CR will treat if it your 1st time playing .-last stand is a really fun game mode, thats put you and 2 others in an arena  where you all try to survive as long as possible -thier is no lvl advangte in last stand , so a lvl 10 and a lvl 1 have no power diffrencees, but what a lvl 10 has over a lvl 1 is options of gear use and the combintaion from that, but it really comes down to the player and thier skill-mutliplayer may be fun online agianst other players but i never tried it -the game has good music and lots of blood being spread in any of it's game modes ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Chaos Units are a mix of Renegades, Demons, the Lost and the Damned, and Chaos Space Marines. They seem to specialize in murdering light infantry and any army facing them should bear this in mind. The campaign is about the same as the first game and includes a corruptions system that allows you to use tainted equipment that will slowly bring the ruinous powers of the warp upon your squads. You don't have to, but it is interesting to allow this to happen.The game uses Games for Windows Live, and may not survive when the service ceases to exist in June 2014.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(..for my full review, look for the heading ""Rager's Review of DoW1&2&Ch.-Rising""..)DoW 2 Chaos Rising is an interesting expansion for Dawn of War 2. I played FPS games, and to a lesser extent third-person games, all my life and I never gave strategy games much of a chance because they did not suite me well. But the Dawn of War series appealed to me with its art work, story explanation, and user written reviews. I gave the series a good try and to say I'm 'just amazed' would not fully describe how much I enjoyed this! I find that because this is a standalone, you might want to purchase the original game first/along side this, but either way they both come with the co op game mode 'The Final Stand,' multiplayer (not very active), and an awesome campaign. I got to enjoy this and the original DoW 2 all day and all night during a free weekend. I fell in love with the game series <3 and planned on picking it up while on sale but I overslept after playing all night and missed it ;(v-v-v-__ (Rager's Review of DoW1 & DoW2 && DoW2: Chaos Rising) __-v-v-v( I wrote my reviews of DoW 1 // 2 // C.R. over the course of an hour, mostly nonstop typing. It may not be the best review of the series but it is an honest review and might convince you that the DoW series might be for you. Enjoy! )[[-_ DoW #1 _-]]-DoW1 is what you would think of a strategy game, meaning you build an HQ, barracks, generators, etc and then dominate your opponent (with the exception of some missions based on command one squad and infiltrate the enemy's territory)---The multiplayer was hardly alive, and I was unable to join a match the first and last attempt I made.[[-_ DoW #2 _-]]-DoW2's campaign is mostly command the Force Commander (the main character which you get to name) and 3 other squads and dominate the enemy orks, farseer, chaos, tyranid. Did I mention it is co op?---That isn't the only great part of #2 though! It also has a co op survival game mode called ""The Final Stand"" where you and 2 others work together to survive and progress through the increasingly difficult waves of enemy A.I. You get to choose your race and also level up each individually, earning new abilities, armor, and weapons. This game mode is still partially alive with players.[[-_ DoW #2 Chaos Rising (standalone sequel) _-]]- DoW2 Chaos Rising's campaign is based on an encounter with the Chaos Space Marines (for those who don't know; the Chaos S.M.s are ""heretic rebels"" to put it quickly). It was quite interesting but I did not make it very far into the story so I won't give it a full opinion. For me it was more appealing than the original DoW2's story because I had an experienced friend play co op with me. ---A few features of Chaos Rising - Corruption meter (scroll to the bottom of the review for explanation), corrupted armor/gear useable by your corrupted space marine squads, and the same goes for those who go the way of purity---Chaos Rising is sometimes said to be dull or predictable; I cannot agree or deny this as I did not get too far into it----Thanks for reading/skimming through my review!! ;)-Chaos Rising - Purity vs. Corruption skill points---Purity; viewed as space marine devoted to his emperor; earned by completing the mission and no corrupted objectives( (10/10) - Would play all weekend long again (Except next time I'll remember to purchase it earlier!) )			",178,57,6,20,16,3,25

												This a very good game and some interseting points would be :-lots of action like a shooter-campaign is very well done , but i would had liked more random missions that keep u busy like in the vanilla copy , which offers lots of gear collecting and selling and allows you to play in many diffrent sectors and regions in a planet and space system-campiagn has a carry over system which u can use your units from the vanilla copy ,but only if u beat it ; futhermore, you carry the equipment and ablitiles you had for the final boss battle into chaos rising , but you gian access to the equipment after you have completed the 1st mission. It set in a way wether you carry over or not the expreince from the 1st mission in CR will treat if it your 1st time playing .-last stand is a really fun game mode, thats put you and 2 others in an arena  where you all try to survive as long as possible -thier is no lvl advangte in last stand , so a lvl 10 and a lvl 1 have no power diffrencees, but what a lvl 10 has over a lvl 1 is options of gear use and the combintaion from that, but it really comes down to the player and thier skill-mutliplayer may be fun online agianst other players but i never tried it -the game has good music and lots of blood being spread in any of it's game modes ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i don't get why people like this game it is just the worst. First of all the controls are flaky at best and cause me to blow a gasket over the most simple commands. Space marines die way to fast for the cannon. The boss battles are a test of patience and annoyance due to the ungodly amount of health that they get and the fact that hey will often ignore your tanks and go after the rest of your squad causeing a daisy chain of reviveals that ends in a unsatifying victory. I would rather see the series go back to it's roots and actually be a RTS with base building.			",80,15,1,28,22,0,37

												I'm a big 40k fan. I'm about 20 books into the Horus Heresy series and was really looking forward to this part of DoW II. It starts off good, thrown into the action on a frozen planet (new) and later on you get to do missions inside a space hulk (ship)(which is also new) but the story was over before it even really began for me.There are four chaos gods in the warhammer universe, each with their own aspect. I was expecting a tour-de-force on the chaos gods but it only really focuses in on a servant of nurgle (god of decay) called Ulkair.This felt more like an experimentation of different game mechanics than a fleshing out of the original. The ability to import your commander and units from DoW II is a nice touch.Lastly, the difficulty ramp for the final boss is ludicrous (by the end of the game my units were all max level with pretty good wargear) and requires you to break stride with the way you have played the entire game in order to succeed. Dow II and retribution and both better than this but it's still worth a few dollars/pounds/euros for the complete picture.			",472,110,17,68,43,3,97

												I rate the game Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II: Chaos Rising 3/5. OK.If you want more of the same campaign with the same characters as the original Dawn of War II game you should definitely give this add-on a try. However, there really isn't a lot else to this game except it lets you play as Chaos forces in the multiplayer modes and has multiple endings.The single player campaign is nifty in that you can easily pick up your characters and their various customized skills and many of their items pretty much where the main campaign of Dawn of War 2 left off. On the downside though the final boss fight of this add-on's final mission is needlessly frustrating and very poorly designed. On the easiest difficulty, playing it twice I must admit I was unable to beat the game's final boss. The ending mission's boss fight is a LOT harder than any of the boss fights leading up to it (those I had absolutely no trouble with but fighting against Ulkair himself is ludicrously frustrating).Perhaps the signle best thing about this game is how the single player campaign also has several endings and which ending you get seems to depend heavily on how you did and what choices you made in most of the previous missions of the add-on leading right through to the ending. These endings range from your main character being executed to you and your squad being proclaimed heroes (an excellent variety of endings). These multiple endings and the manner in which you must arrive at them (through the decisions you make over the course of the entire add-on) are a very welcome change from how most games tend to work, and the manner in which this game executes its multiple-ending structure well done even when compared to many other games which do have multiple endings. Getting one ending versus another in Chaos Rising is not so simple or easy as deciding between flipping one switch after the final boss fight versus another (as was true in Deus Es: Human Revolution). in Chaos Rising, which ending you get depends on what objectives you fulfill or not and what items you choose to use and not all along the way, almost from beginning to end.Although the multiple-ending structure adds some potential replayability to this game, although the game itself, its story and which missions you have access to and what order they are arranged in is, for the most part, arranged in a fairly linear fashion and the frustrating final boss fight serves as a bit too much of a counterweight to this game's various strengths. Also, there are still no single-player campaigns which let you play as any force other than that of the Blood Ravens Space Marines from the original Dawn of War 2 and endings in the Warhammer 40K universe can be predictable due to the sheer implacability of the game's setting. Regardless of what you do, war is going to continue (and so sequels are going to happen) but this is true to the franchise.			",172,24,2,6,7,0,17

												I wrote several reviews about this game, this is my final. This is not a strict strategy game, its a MOBA+strategy, a hybrid. Its good only for 2v2 and 3v3 and that's what most players of this game play. Its well suited for Faction war meaning all 3 heroes of the same faction together in the same team fighting all the 3 heroes of another faction. Playing the game like that its real fun so for i recommend real life friends to get it as this is how i started this game. Dont get the game if you are to play it solo you wont have fun. It would be great if its campaign had 4 player cooperate instead of 2 so that's a big deal negative, if there is a patch  that makes coop campaign for 4 players that would be great. In general i only recommend to get this game if you have a real life premade team lets say or you plan to play it with online friends, its good for that. Its a minimized CoH 1 but its not Warhammer game. If yougonna play multiplayer DoW 2 Retribution then you MUST get Elite mod, if makes the game real good and balanced. The modding team even fixed bugs retail has. The single player sadly has no 4 player coop mode but 2 which is very bad. DoW 2 Retribution is poorly made mini CoH 1 and has nothing to do with Warhammer 40K. DoW 1 mods are WAY BETTER and are 40K SOLID. To a casual gamer i recommend this game, to someone who wants 40K no i dont. This is a review for both DoW 2 and DoW 2 Retribution.****VERY IMPORTANT****Base turrests broke mmultiplayer.

												More of the first, this game focuses on the Chaos and the place where Daemons come from, the Warp. You are able to import your save which is always a + in my opinion as you can carry over the xp, gear, and so on from the last game. There's also a corruption meter and depending on what you do you get more corrupt or less. To remain uncorrupted is hard and you gain no real benefits from it besides a good ending where as if you have become corrupted you gain many different special boons that help enforce your characters, but at what cost? It's game length however is quite short, but then again what do you expect when it's an expansion? If you have DoW2, I suggest getting this as your teams level cap is extended by 10 and you can bring over all your equipment, though your terminator armour is ""damaged"" until you get a tech to repair it.

												Idk why but Dawn of War II and Chaos Rising is hella addicting.....get it dudes!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: 6/20/2015 4:55 p.m.In light of recent events, I feel compelled to provide a much more thorough review of Dawn of War II - Chaos Rising. Though I personally find my own review adequate, certain individuals have brought to my attention the possible vagueness surrounding the review.I have constructed my edited review following a suggested format by a hard-core fan of mine. I understand my position of power makes my gaming decisions influential to those around me. I wholeheartedly apologize for the lack of depth in my original review - I hope my fans can accept my blunder and gain some insight from my revisions. Given the number of repeated requests by an even larger number of dedicated fans, I introduce my more detailed review of Chaos Rising:Graphics: Wow. Where do I even begin? Let's just say that the graphics are exactly what you would expect from Dawn of War. I was absolutely thrilled that I was not let down. Sometimes when it is late at night and I've had a few glasses of wine, I sit there and ponder how the graphics of a game could be so epic. 10/10Gameplay: If I've ever had an adrenaline rush in my life, this is where it's been experienced. The sheer excitement of the combat has truly knocked my socks off. The Force Commander is a Force to be reckoned with, hehe. Oh how I wish I could have his jet pack in my life. One can only dream. 10/10Story: From the first second of this expansion, I was glued to my seat and my fingers glued to my mouse/keyboard. Will I become corrupted? I still ask myself that very same question each time that I play. The plot is filled with twists and turns that give another meaning to the words revenge and betrayal. Every distress call I receive leads to a rapidly beating heart - this forces me to momentarily exit the game until I am able to overcome the overwhelming story. 10/10UI: The buttons look very button-y and things always happen when I click on them. I was sold from there. 10/10Fun Level: I walk away from every Chaos Rising session thinking about how gratifying that last mission was. The only issue with the fun level in this game is it is so extraordinary that everything else in your life will pale in comparison. A wide circle of friends and acquaintances have attempted to bring as much excitement into my life by offering free sky-diving lessons or tours of Jelly Bean factories. I always have to explain to them that they should keep their parachutes and jelly beans to themselves - I am busy experiencing a game with endless happiness and pleasure. 10/10Overall Score: It was hella good. 10/10			",115,34,8,26,8,2,26

												More of the first, this game focuses on the Chaos and the place where Daemons come from, the Warp. You are able to import your save which is always a + in my opinion as you can carry over the xp, gear, and so on from the last game. There's also a corruption meter and depending on what you do you get more corrupt or less. To remain uncorrupted is hard and you gain no real benefits from it besides a good ending where as if you have become corrupted you gain many different special boons that help enforce your characters, but at what cost? It's game length however is quite short, but then again what do you expect when it's an expansion? If you have DoW2, I suggest getting this as your teams level cap is extended by 10 and you can bring over all your equipment, though your terminator armour is ""damaged"" until you get a tech to repair it.

												thinking of buying this cause you liked dawn of war 1? don't bother they have ruined the game by making it more of a MOBA than a RTS, you have more or less no base building features at all you just buy troop that you send around the map taking power points and battling something that feels like a useless battle. i LOVE RTS games and i love Dawn of war 1 but it took me 10 minutes to hate this game. they messed up big time with this one. so if you like MOBA and RTS this is a game for you but i can't stand MOBA and this just felt more like that than a RTS..

												I've always been a fan of the Dawn of War franchise and as the second installment I am pleased but not pleased. One of the things Dawn of War I (Escpecially soulstorm) had over other RTS games is the quantity of units. It had A LOT. This game however had less than the previous (even without expansions this game had less!). But units aren't everything...The game did feature a new race not seen before, the Tyranids. They are quite interesting from my experience of the actual model game (They were quite easy to beat, that and they used the dreaded green dice of hell). However the new customisation of heroes is a nice touch and the graphics are amazing compared to Soulstorm so yeah. Get the game.If you like RTS games involving squads and battles of aliens then get this game. If you like any of the Dawn of War games in the past, get this game. If you like apples get an apple. But overall I rate this a good game worth the money as well.7/10P.S. Make sure you don't mess up your visual settings at the start so your mouse is invisible -_-.			",78,7,1,5,4,0,6

												Dawn of War II had almost everything I like in video games: strategy, good pacing, character choice, and involving characters. The story in DOW II was good, and Chaos Rising doesn't disappoint in that regard. The new chaos race is a blast to play as and the upgrades to the other races are very welcome. In the single player, 10 more levels and the corruption system add depth and more choices. So while the campaign is pretty freaking short, it's easily replayable. I guess the shortness of the campaign could be the only weakness in this package, but come on people, it's an expansion pack! A company with a more renowned name might have released something like this as a sequel. Accept it for what it is: an expansion pack. For half the price of a regular game, I say this is a good deal. If you liked Dawn of War II, you will love Chaos Rising!			",750,185,19,65,52,12,83

												If you think this is a strategy game like Command & Conquer, you're pretty much wrong. It's more of an RPG game where you control four squads of three units each and get special equipment and you choose which equipment to equip on which squads. There's also leveling and you add two stat points in any category each level. Basically, it's World of Warcraft meets Starcraft.			",22,1,0,3,3,0,7

												This is by far my favouite startergy game I have played, unlike other startergy games like AOEO (Age Of Empires Online) Relic care about their players and after the shut down of Windows Marketplace (Thanks again Microsoft) This game didn't just shut down like AOEO, with time and effort Relic made the game online systems still functional, they joined with Steam after the marketplace shutdown, and thanks to Relic you can now enjoy this games online modes, even after the windows marketplace shutdown.Anyway back to the game, if you don't like MMOs like World of Warcraft, but enjoy startergey games like me. Then this game will not dissapoint you. With a well structured online system, campaign and horde mode this game is crafted perfectly by deveopers who care about the players and not just the money *Cough* EA!.Along with the campagin and horde mode, it has the element of loot or geat, and also leveling up and choosing stats, to improve you squad and seperate charecters to make your gamplay suit you. Overall if your looking for a good startergy game with some fancy graphics and enjoyable gamepay, gamemodes and just a great game overall. I am sure you will not be disspointed with this purchase.

												A quality add-on to a quality game, Chaos Rising reintroduces everyone's favorite heretical♥♥♥♥♥holes to Dawn of War in a major way, putting the Blood Ravens through yet more abuse you wonder how they deserved. Chaos Rising has many possible ending variations, the element of ""cursed"" wargear that is more powerful then other items but can corrupt your characters, and the ability to import your save from vanilla DoW II- which is good, because you need the base game to play this expansion anyway. I recommend Chaos Rising heartily and also that you play Retribution afterwards.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												As with the first game in this sequel series, the Dawn of War series has gone Battle Arena style. With the success of the first DoW2 game, it's not too surprising. It's not a real-time strategy, resource management base-building game but more along the lines of a MOBA. If you really really like the original mythology or don't want the resource managment, then this game could be for you. Get it when it's under $7 USD on it's own, or better yet, wait for the inevitable but frequent seasonal Steam sale and get the whole series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far, the BEST Dawn of War title!  I like DoW2, over DoW1... Its not the most popular opinion, but so many rts have base building, and blobs of infantry.. DoW2 ditched that slow 10-15mins of each match, and gave Heros for units.. The Campaign is my favorite part of the game, which ive played dozens of times over.. DoW2 had tons of missions, of which you could earn even more with bonuses met during missions.. DoW2, and Chaos Rising both had TONS of weapons, armor, relics, and useables! (all of these points were dropped for Retribution.. My least liked DoW title). The graphics were top quality for their time, and even today look quite good.. The environment isnt as high quality as the units, but again.. Looked great when released.. You get to crush, shoot, blow up, incinerate, and vaporize your enemies.. Hero units have abilities, all of which are Energy based..  You have 7 different units to choose from, each with different skill sets.. Tarkus, and Avitus were two of my favorites, as well as Davian Thule.. But in Chaos Rising, we got Jonah, the Librarian.. Extremely powerful melee combatant, or ranged spell caster.. Also a great support role, but you emnd up losing a damage unit, and if you also took Cyrus, this can be difficult to voercome.. Tarkus usually is your tank/soaker, and deals slightly less damage overall.. All of your hero units have 4 skill trees that can be advanced, unlocking, and upgrading abilities.;. In Chaos Rising, your progress is carried over, and level cap raised.. Each of the Ability trees have added several new abilities, and unlock to compensate..I could ramble on for awhile, and not even get into the Multiplayer aspect.. Again, the campaign is what i payed for mostly..  Now that its been fixed to remove the GFWL, all achievments had been reset,and playtime reset ( I had between 600-700hrs in DoW2).. I had several hundred hours in both DoW2, and DoW2:CR.. Edit: The Last Stand mode is also a fan favorite, and one of mine as well..But ill leave that for another discussion..			",60,13,0,15,1,0,6

												Two thumbs down. Absolutely broken. You can't save in-game and squads will get stuck _ever single mission_. So you can't even save-load your way out of an unwinable, broken mission.

												By far one of the best strategy games after Company of Heroes. It has many different kind of units and maps for various strategies, the only problem is that it is very hard to find players to play the last stand or a ranked mp match...Anyway, the game is very good and if you play on ultra settings its again better!

												It all started when our protagonist, Civ 5, woke up in a pumpkin patch. It was the fourth time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously exasperated, Civ 5 groped a sock, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unexpectedly, he realized that his beloved ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was missing! Immediately he called his friend, Leroy Jenkins. Civ 5 had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were sassy ones. Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was intelligent though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Civ 5 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very happy Civ 5. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating, yet otters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Civ 5. Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Civ 5? Because he had snuck out from Civ 5's with the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth only four days prior. It was a saucy little ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth... how could he resist?It didn't take long before Civ 5 got back to the subject at hand: his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Civ 5 took the truck, he had take at least eleven minutes before Civ 5 would get there. But if he took the ♥♥♥? Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief. That's when he heard the ♥♥♥ rolling up. It was Civ 5.----o0o---- As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of pencils, so he knew he was running late. With a calculated leap, Civ 5 was out of the ♥♥♥ and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door. Meanwhile inside, Leroy Jenkins was panicking. Not thinking, he tossed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano. Leroy Jenkins was concerned but at least the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was concealed. The doorbell rang.'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins sassily purred. With a careful push, Civ 5 opened the door. 'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling maniac in a Vette,' he lied. 'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness. 'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted. But Civ 5 was distracted. Without warning, Leroy Jenkins noticed a selfish look on Civ 5's face. Civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak.'...What's that smell?'Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when Civ 5 asked this. In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what? I don't smell anything..!' A lie. A insensitive look started to form on Civ 5's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies. She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it. The ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was plainly in view.Civ 5 stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four seconds. Unexpectedly, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Civ 5's direction, clearly desperate. Civ 5 grabbed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and bolted for the door. It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Civ 5,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little insensitive, so Civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking mittens at him or something. All of a sudden, he gripped his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell? That seemed excessive. The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Civ 5. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Civ 5. 'Oh. You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Civ 5 was gone.----o0o---- Just yonder, Civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength. Another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. One by one they latched on to Civ 5. Already weakened from his injury, Civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed. The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth.About seven hours later, Civ 5 awoke, his butt throbbing. It was dark and Civ 5 did not know where he was. Deep in the humid desert, Civ 5 was abundantly lost. A few minutes later, he remembered that his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was taken by the aligators. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life. That's when, to his horror, a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield. It was the alpha aligator. Civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into Civ 5's face. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Civ 5's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.Less than two miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. 'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened spoon. With a heroic thrust, he buried it deeply into his neck. As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Civ 5... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him. But he would die alone that day. All that remained was the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise. And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come. Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead. So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(			",153,15,0,15,9,3,19

												Summary: A definite blast to play through, and worthy follow-up to Dawn of War II- for the most part. Note: This review focuses on the single-player campaign.The Good: There's a fair bit to praise.-The addition of new weapons and more character options for the character's strike team is a definite plus, at least initially.-The addition of Chaos as an enemy faction and the implementation of the Corruption mechanic are welcome additions, with worthwhile bonuses at the completely Pure and Corrupted stages, and wargear that reward either the Pure or Corrupt. The missions tie into this as well- Pure objectives take some effort to achieve, while Corrupt objectives are easy for the careless (or callous) player to accidentally (or deliberately) complete.-Those who have played Dark Crusade will recognize an old friend from that game, and while his new voice is a debatable change, he is very much the same smug, scheming character.-The boss fights throughout the game are suitably epic (as befits 40k), and the atmosphere of being in a galaxy that can never seem to stay safe is also there (as also befits 40k).-Furthermore, most of everything else that DoW II did well is still present here- very competent meshing of RPG and RTS styles with a deep statistics and upgrade system, complented with an extensive range of wargear.-The game generally performs well- the only problems I experienced with it were frame rate hitches when multiple large explosions occurred at once.-Lore. LOTS of it. Knowledge is power, so feel free to empower yourselves.The Bad: The game's definitely not perfect.-Balancing remains an issue- for instance, once the player acquires enough suits of Terminator armor to outfit everyone who can wear it, there generally isn't a reason to use regular power armor, relegating a fair number of late-game wargear choices to either just looking nice in the armory (for the sentimental, like myself), or being donated for experience.-Chaos Rising is still just an expansion- the story is shorter and more directed than it was in DoWII, and there are fewer missions. The objectives from DoWII that originally boosted some wargear options (i.e. the Signum, Rosarius and Relay Beacon) are now just mission objectives and experience boosters. The removal of defense missions definitely reduces the impression that your strike force is stretched thin across the sector and as such the feeling of tension suffers a bit.-The only campaign available is still the Space Marine campaign- while I liked it, those wanting to play as someone else will be disappointed.-The resolution of the Corruption storyline struggles to keep all of its threads consistently tied. Some of the villains' actions don't make a huge amount of sense over the course of the game, compared to others. A mixed bag, as far as this aspect goes.The Debatable: For better or for worse...-The game is still a DoWII-style game. It's more an RPG/RTS hybrid than a full-on RTS. There is no base-building or economy management. Everything focuses on the units you bring with you at the start. I didn't mind, but those wanting an RTS experience like Dawn of War 1 won't find it here.-Corruption and Purity. Unless the player is completely Pure or very Corrupt, the bonuses they get are near-worthless. This way, the game is only tense if the player wishes to stay Pure, as diving headlong into Corruption is easy if the player doesn't find staying Pure worth the trouble. There's no bonus for trying to find a balance, and the tension is lop-sided. That said, it may be the point of the whole exercise, so your mileage may vary.-Steve Blum is EVERYWHERE in this game. Take that for what you will.To wrap up: It's good. Not perfect, but still really good. I'd recommend playing on a higher difficulty (Captain for the average player, Primarch otherwise), and trying to stay Pure. The two lower difficulty levels make staying Pure way too easy and sap the tension out of the game. But, if you're just here to see the plot without wanting your favorite Space Marines fall to the dark influences of Chaos, then Sergeant or Initiate are fine, you spineless abhuman.

												As soon as i picked up WARHAMMER 40k DAWN OF WAR II CHAOS RISING thursday morning at my local GAMESTOP i have been playing almost non-stop and have yet to even be 10% into the expansion this is how challenging yet addictively fun it is. Gameplay- Excellent balance which keeps me on my toes as i use all the new cool tactics and weaponery made available to me. Loot fanatics wont be disappointed with all the choices in killing toys and armor at their disposal. They all compliment certain play styles which adds to the replay value immensely. Of course if your valiant heroes pick up an item off the battlefield corrupted by Chaos there will be a price to pay as the ingame meter shall start warning you of your descent to the..dark side for using such cursed weaponery and armor. All is not lost though for there are ways of resisting and purging the taint from your spirit. Your units feel even more alive and interactive with the CHAOS RISING expansion as they speak of what is going around you on and off the battlefield.  The forces of Chaos are truly terrifying and brutal in their entrance into the DAWN OF WAR 2 reality. Cultist are now fearsome in visual presence and vocal expression who are excellent frontline units that can take and deliever plenty of punishment. Graphics- The forces of Chaos look truly evil appearing as something out of a futuristic satanic inquisition. The Chaos Lord is like some great horned god of old. Cultist no longer seem demoralised masochastic slaves but instead show their strength in joyful slaughtering despoiling psychosis with a more serious side further enhanced by their much more powerful creepy body frames compared to the devious humorous but still fun demeanor of their counterparts in the original DAWN OF WAR.  Sound- I use headphones so for me the audio sounded very full and powerful. Combat effects are devastating with explosive effect and unit vocals bring out the heart inspiring heroic and mind searing horror of the forces at play in this gruesome world of unending carnage. Music is stunning and its because of games like RELIC's CHAOS RISING and BETHESDA's rpgs that my appreciation of classical music never fades but only grows stronger over time. WARHAMMER 40k DAWN OF WAR II CHAOS RISING is a huge magically well done work full of top notch quality professional game design that delievers the goods in gameplay execution and graphical stimulation plus much much more. RELIC is also providing 200%+ support for their product already releasing one small hot fix patch for some reported crashing on some systems. I never had this problem but its great to see RELIC on target with keeping their work the best it can be. It was also great before CHAOS RISING for RELIC to include limited use of the forces of Chaos in the pre-release patch so fans could get a taste of the expansion without even owning it yet. Very nice there :) WARHAMMER 40k DAWN OF WAR II CHAOS RISING buy it and ye shall know the unbound gaming joy which is RELIC!!! ",255,49,4,61,35,1,105

												My review is only Last Stand mode relatedIts idea is good. Damn good. Like always it shares a number of flaws which are more likely found in other modes too.Last Stand mode is sort of survival composed of 20 waves. Up to 3 people MUST play (game doesn't allow to start game with less than 3 peoples present, more players can't join). Players join through search engine and here the♥♥♥♥♥♥storm begins. The very main and constant, yes I play LS withn non-lagging friend and the frequency of finding a random, lagging player is higher than finding a non-lagging.Unfortunately it works like this - if lagging player causes lag due to either low fps or slow connection then EVERYONE on this game/server has to wait for that player. Yes. It's not like entities are teleporting around for lagging player and he has to catch up. No. The game simply stops for everyone present and everyone has to wait for that one player. It's terrible and I can honnestly tell this happens really, really frequently. Imagine one player looking for 2 random players and those 2 do not lag. If one lags then everyone is forced to wait and wait. It's virtually impossible.Another issue is strategy. I know that this is player related. All depends on language barrier and experience, in fact it doesn't matter that much but I think it's somewhat of necessety for a strategy game to discuss the strategy and here is how search engine deals with players.The game starts in next 30 seconds after search engine finds enough players. And when the team will either die or win, then players are taken back to the lobby and there is no longer automatic 30 second start limit again. One player is responsible for starting the game. My question is - why the lobby doesn't work the in same manner like after win or lose? That means there is no chance to discuss strategy after finding players. You have to win or more likely die in order to have a chance to discuss this. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The fact that you have time after lose and not after completing players is makes no logical sense. And how about when one or both players leave after that one game?Here's a little minor complain but still it can be annoying.Search engine can choose you a player half world away. That may cause an connection lag. In fact it doesn't happen that frequently. Seems like in this game ping of around 300 doesn't really matter as much.There are 20 waves where 16th is unique. 20th too but let me say something about this one. It's a glitch that also occurs on 20. You fight 3 clones of characters your team has chosen. They are more powerful but with sort of luck and smart strategy AND with proper items (refering to strategy discussion) 16 wave can be beaten pretty easly. What happens is that Farseer's abilities can glitch out seriously. What happens is that for who knows what reasons you can't use abilities like Confuse on enemies. Instead you can point on your teammates, Farseer will say lines she use when using Confuse, although she doesn't cast Confuse on teammates. Just says her line and that's it but you're still unable to use this ability on enemies and this one is one of the best ability for 16 wave because it usually forces enemy units to fight among themselves. Eventually this glitch somehow worns off but I can't tell what exactly causes this and how to get rid of it. Doesn't matter really. All I wanted to point out is that there's a glitch it shouldn't be present in the first time.Also, Sorcerer's abilities can also glitch out. These happen very frequently through out the whole LS  game. What happens is that projectile abilities like Doombolt or Let the Galaxy Burn sometimes misfire. That is the Sorcerer does lauch animation, energy is consumed but no projectile is launched.Not to mention Sorcerer is glitched so much that with composition of low health teammates, Sorcerer with special set of items can easly beat the whole game by himself. That's a glitch that actually isn't something bad at some point. 16th wave clone can't exploit these glitches but it simply makes the game too easy and such Sorcerer can make the game boring for rest of the teammates. To simply put - using projectile abilities with Sorcerer can cause to drain energy and shoot nothing.Marine with Plasma gun gets a Hellfire grenade. In Campain and Skirmish throwing grenade into building works just fine. You throw at building, grenade explodes inside the building. Simple. In Last Stand in other hand there is no such thing. Of course it's a glitch done on purpose but what happens is that Marine gets stuck. After throwing grenade, Marine just stops, doesn't throw at all and player is unable to control him. Sometimes Marine even automatically chooses his target. Even a target that is out of grenades throwing range.Covers are scattered all over the map. These are very useful for ranged units fighting with ranged units. Covers simply reduce frequency of damage taken. It's mandatory for Ork on Last Stand mode. What stinks about these and usually it's Ork related too is that he sometimes tends to simply leave cover after teleporting behind it. Not too frequent but it happens and can have a major impact on later waves.Another instance related to this issue is when unit hiding behind cover sometimes leaves cover when melee unit is approching. Also happens sometimes but when such low-health Ork is being under heavy fire and an enemy melee unit will draw him from cover... yea.Other than that and some other minor issues I forgot to mention about, this game is a fine RTS with an unique universe. Personally I recommend it. Unless you don't want to struggle with issues like these.I enjoy sharing info about issues certain game has. Not ony it's more entertaining but also shares a useful amount of important information rather than just blatant ""Dis game iz cool. I like it"". Being mad is not the case here. TF2 is anger inducing with rediculous hit detection and a need of powerful machine for optimal amount of frames where these are also hit registration related.			",64,1,0,0,1,1,7

												While the gameplay is exactly like Dawn of War 2, Chaos Rising adds the Chaos Space Marines and the story itself is much darker in very aspect. All I can say is that this is pretty much what you can expect in a expansion. If you truly want the Warhammer 40k experience, get Retribution or Space Marine. This is only a must for those who want to continue the story from Dawn of War 2 and know more backstory going in Retribution.			",85,10,0,23,12,1,42

												One of the most enjoyable campaigns in Dawn of War II, where you can choose your own destiny - is your faith in Emperor's might strong enough to resist whispers from the Warp?Variety of places you visit and fast-paced action doesn't let you get bored, the graphics and sounds are really well done (nothing less expected from Dawn of War series) and flavor in items' description feeds your inner nerd.As for the multiplayer, although many people complain about the new system of only one building and smaller armies, Dawn of War II is in at least few ways superior to its predecessor. It has a gameplay that rewards smart play (though the same could be said about the old one), since in a small army every unit is important and the cover system allows you to use terrain to your advantage.  Each hero can be equipped with his own set of items, adding some variety to your play, just like each race special abilities. Overall, it's a good game, especially for those interested in w40k universe. Very different from Dawn of War 1 we all know and love, but still worth a try.			",93,10,1,13,8,1,21

												Great game. Space Marines, Eldar, Orks, Tyranids and with the expansion you get Chaos Marines. Each of them has its own way to play but in the end what you'll like in this game is its fast paced games, its bloody gunfights and its nasty explosions! Although it features not the same strategic aspects of Company of Heroes, this game rocks!The campaing is good but it tends to be repetitive after a while. It's compensated by the level-up system of heroes you control during the game that offers great customization.Multplayer is well-built with solid mechanics and the gunfights are truly frenetic.Amazing game! Must try the demo and then buy it!::Skrot::			",81,22,11,13,11,0,24

												I've always loved the Warhammer series, and that includes this title :)  Here they went for more a Tactical squad based approach rather than the traditional base building and unit spamming, but it is done very well and has a fun campaign, ways to level up your squad with abilities and gear, plus multiple game modes in multiplayer.  Definitely worth it if you are an RTS fan.			",225,32,1,52,33,0,49

												The campaign mode is like an RTS RPG and a good one. While the campaign missions are more diverse and original than those of DoWII, it is a MUCH shorter experience. However, the corruption gameplay and additional characters, weapons, gear, & etc. help counter this somewhat.I personally haven't dabelled too much into the multiplayer vs modes, but they seem solid from what I understand if you're into that. The Last Stand mode is also a fun survival-type mode that should keep you entertained for quite some time as you try out all the different heroes and level them up.I would also add that Dawn of War II is recommended if you buy this. They're pretty much made to go together.			",185,45,1,25,8,4,27

												Chaos Rising continues the story of Dawn of War II. This time instead of the tyrannids the main enemy is the forces of chaos. The orks and eldar are present but they aren't really important at all. Two new locations are added; a frozen planet lost in the warp for one thousand years and a warp corrupted battle-barge. Corruption has made its way within the Blood Angels and it is up to you to find out who are the traitors. Unlike the original Dawn of War II, Chaos Rising's campaign actually features multiple endings and missions based on how corrupted the player's force commander and other squads are. Choices within missions and equiping chaos war gear will cause your squads to become more corrupted. However Corrupted wargear is much stronger than regular wargear and ""redeeming"" wargear (wargear that reduces corruption) is even worse than regular wargear. This actually makes trying to deal with corruption a very compelling game mechanic if you are trying to stay pure and loyal to the emperor. If you still have your save file for Dawn of War II you have the option to continue using it to keep your levels and gear in Chaos Rising.Multiplayer is pretty much dead but Retribution, the last expansion pack of Dawn of War II, still has an active multiplayer community.

												An even better game than Dawn of War II, it largely makes up for the original's shortcomings. The story is more engaging, the missions are less monotone and the campaign has a higher level of replayability due to the decisions you can make.			",135,50,3,15,10,0,30

												Amazing, fast paced, glamorous RTS game. If you like strategy games such as supreme commander 2 / Empire total war but hate the time it takes to get into epic action, I highly recommend getting this game instead. Also if you like the idea of owning horde after horde of enemies, this is the perfect game for you.			",193,12,7,22,12,1,31

												My review is only Last Stand mode relatedIts idea is good. Damn good. Like always it shares a number of flaws which are more likely found in other modes too.Last Stand mode is sort of survival composed of 20 waves. Up to 3 people MUST play (game doesn't allow to start game with less than 3 peoples present, more players can't join). Players join through search engine and here the♥♥♥♥♥♥storm begins. The very main and constant, yes I play LS withn non-lagging friend and the frequency of finding a random, lagging player is higher than finding a non-lagging.Unfortunately it works like this - if lagging player causes lag due to either low fps or slow connection then EVERYONE on this game/server has to wait for that player. Yes. It's not like entities are teleporting around for lagging player and he has to catch up. No. The game simply stops for everyone present and everyone has to wait for that one player. It's terrible and I can honnestly tell this happens really, really frequently. Imagine one player looking for 2 random players and those 2 do not lag. If one lags then everyone is forced to wait and wait. It's virtually impossible.Another issue is strategy. I know that this is player related. All depends on language barrier and experience, in fact it doesn't matter that much but I think it's somewhat of necessety for a strategy game to discuss the strategy and here is how search engine deals with players.The game starts in next 30 seconds after search engine finds enough players. And when the team will either die or win, then players are taken back to the lobby and there is no longer automatic 30 second start limit again. One player is responsible for starting the game. My question is - why the lobby doesn't work the in same manner like after win or lose? That means there is no chance to discuss strategy after finding players. You have to win or more likely die in order to have a chance to discuss this. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The fact that you have time after lose and not after completing players is makes no logical sense. And how about when one or both players leave after that one game?Here's a little minor complain but still it can be annoying.Search engine can choose you a player half world away. That may cause an connection lag. In fact it doesn't happen that frequently. Seems like in this game ping of around 300 doesn't really matter as much.There are 20 waves where 16th is unique. 20th too but let me say something about this one. It's a glitch that also occurs on 20. You fight 3 clones of characters your team has chosen. They are more powerful but with sort of luck and smart strategy AND with proper items (refering to strategy discussion) 16 wave can be beaten pretty easly. What happens is that Farseer's abilities can glitch out seriously. What happens is that for who knows what reasons you can't use abilities like Confuse on enemies. Instead you can point on your teammates, Farseer will say lines she use when using Confuse, although she doesn't cast Confuse on teammates. Just says her line and that's it but you're still unable to use this ability on enemies and this one is one of the best ability for 16 wave because it usually forces enemy units to fight among themselves. Eventually this glitch somehow worns off but I can't tell what exactly causes this and how to get rid of it. Doesn't matter really. All I wanted to point out is that there's a glitch it shouldn't be present in the first time.Also, Sorcerer's abilities can also glitch out. These happen very frequently through out the whole LS  game. What happens is that projectile abilities like Doombolt or Let the Galaxy Burn sometimes misfire. That is the Sorcerer does lauch animation, energy is consumed but no projectile is launched.Not to mention Sorcerer is glitched so much that with composition of low health teammates, Sorcerer with special set of items can easly beat the whole game by himself. That's a glitch that actually isn't something bad at some point. 16th wave clone can't exploit these glitches but it simply makes the game too easy and such Sorcerer can make the game boring for rest of the teammates. To simply put - using projectile abilities with Sorcerer can cause to drain energy and shoot nothing.Marine with Plasma gun gets a Hellfire grenade. In Campain and Skirmish throwing grenade into building works just fine. You throw at building, grenade explodes inside the building. Simple. In Last Stand in other hand there is no such thing. Of course it's a glitch done on purpose but what happens is that Marine gets stuck. After throwing grenade, Marine just stops, doesn't throw at all and player is unable to control him. Sometimes Marine even automatically chooses his target. Even a target that is out of grenades throwing range.Covers are scattered all over the map. These are very useful for ranged units fighting with ranged units. Covers simply reduce frequency of damage taken. It's mandatory for Ork on Last Stand mode. What stinks about these and usually it's Ork related too is that he sometimes tends to simply leave cover after teleporting behind it. Not too frequent but it happens and can have a major impact on later waves.Another instance related to this issue is when unit hiding behind cover sometimes leaves cover when melee unit is approching. Also happens sometimes but when such low-health Ork is being under heavy fire and an enemy melee unit will draw him from cover... yea.Other than that and some other minor issues I forgot to mention about, this game is a fine RTS with an unique universe. Personally I recommend it. Unless you don't want to struggle with issues like these.I enjoy sharing info about issues certain game has. Not ony it's more entertaining but also shares a useful amount of important information rather than just blatant ""Dis game iz cool. I like it"". Being mad is not the case here. TF2 is anger inducing with rediculous hit detection and a need of powerful machine for optimal amount of frames where these are also hit registration related.			",64,1,0,0,1,1,7

												This game is a perfect mix between strategy and Action. You can play your original strategy game with the 4 races given, then you can buy packs that give you two more races. Then you can use th races to play in a mode where you level up your champion and fight waves of troops. It is a really fun game to pplay when you want to have fun. I really enjoy it, and i would recomend this to anyone. Rate 9.5/10, it lacks some areas of the actual Tabletop game, but it is still a good game. If your not excited about it, then wait for a sale. Note: This game is a couple of years old, so not a lot of people play online, Single player is still fun.			",21,0,0,4,4,0,13

												It all started when our protagonist, Civ 5, woke up in a pumpkin patch. It was the fourth time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously exasperated, Civ 5 groped a sock, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unexpectedly, he realized that his beloved ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was missing! Immediately he called his friend, Leroy Jenkins. Civ 5 had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were sassy ones. Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was intelligent though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Civ 5 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very happy Civ 5. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating, yet otters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Civ 5. Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Civ 5? Because he had snuck out from Civ 5's with the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth only four days prior. It was a saucy little ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth... how could he resist?It didn't take long before Civ 5 got back to the subject at hand: his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Civ 5 took the truck, he had take at least eleven minutes before Civ 5 would get there. But if he took the ♥♥♥? Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief. That's when he heard the ♥♥♥ rolling up. It was Civ 5.----o0o---- As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of pencils, so he knew he was running late. With a calculated leap, Civ 5 was out of the ♥♥♥ and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door. Meanwhile inside, Leroy Jenkins was panicking. Not thinking, he tossed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano. Leroy Jenkins was concerned but at least the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was concealed. The doorbell rang.'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins sassily purred. With a careful push, Civ 5 opened the door. 'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling maniac in a Vette,' he lied. 'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness. 'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted. But Civ 5 was distracted. Without warning, Leroy Jenkins noticed a selfish look on Civ 5's face. Civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak.'...What's that smell?'Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when Civ 5 asked this. In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what? I don't smell anything..!' A lie. A insensitive look started to form on Civ 5's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies. She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it. The ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was plainly in view.Civ 5 stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four seconds. Unexpectedly, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Civ 5's direction, clearly desperate. Civ 5 grabbed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and bolted for the door. It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Civ 5,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little insensitive, so Civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking mittens at him or something. All of a sudden, he gripped his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell? That seemed excessive. The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Civ 5. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Civ 5. 'Oh. You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Civ 5 was gone.----o0o---- Just yonder, Civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength. Another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. One by one they latched on to Civ 5. Already weakened from his injury, Civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed. The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth.About seven hours later, Civ 5 awoke, his butt throbbing. It was dark and Civ 5 did not know where he was. Deep in the humid desert, Civ 5 was abundantly lost. A few minutes later, he remembered that his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was taken by the aligators. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life. That's when, to his horror, a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield. It was the alpha aligator. Civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into Civ 5's face. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Civ 5's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.Less than two miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. 'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened spoon. With a heroic thrust, he buried it deeply into his neck. As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Civ 5... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him. But he would die alone that day. All that remained was the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise. And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come. Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead. So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(			",153,15,0,15,9,3,19

												While not as long as Dawn of War II, Chaos Rising makes up for it with increased depth in the form of the new corruption system. Now certain weapons that you use or actions that you take will lead to increasing your character's alignment with Chaos, giving them new abilities in exchange for betraying their oath to the Emperor. This feeds into several different gameplay scenarios and multiple endings, based on how corrupt you are throughout the game. There are also new abilities (both passive and active) and a level cap of thirty when you carry over your characters from Dawn of War 2. Chaos Rising is a worthy expansion to its predecessor and if you loved DW2 then you'll see it as a welcome return to the Blood Ravens.			",107,19,0,13,2,1,14

												Honestly, this game is simply a fat XP for the orginal. If you played DoWII, you have played this game. DO NOT think that this downplays your enjoyment experience! Everything that was amazing and fulfilling about DoWII is back, along with new strategic concepts, abilities, gear, a new stat to keep track of and perhaps earn new abilities from, and even a new character.  Your courruption (said new stat) also adds a new dyanamic of difficulty to planning in the game, as certain actions, gear, objectives, and even who you bring along on a mission will affect your corruption level. Will you be the uberbad guy for extra power, or stay loyal to the emperor? Both offer their own added challenges, especially since Corruption becomes harder to earn as you become more corrupt. Care to not be corrupt anymore? You can cleanse yourself, but the road to redemption is not an easy one. Redeeming gear makes you take more damage. Redeeming tasks will often make you hate life as you run off to complete them while facing an entire legion of armor. The campaign is more of the same AWESOME. The abilities are more of the same AWESOME. Same said for characters, stories, and planning. You can make your squad into almost any focus, and you can do so CO-OP. If you do not have this game, and you are on my friends list, BUY IT or I will disown you. If you do not know me, but you LOVE RTS games, Starcraft RPG maps, or anything that makes you think on your feet, GET THIS GAME. If you like MOBAs, GET THIS. It is not a MOBA, but you will easily pick this game up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I preferred this over the first and I'm sure what did it for anyone else who likes this as well as myself is the traitor aspect.  The only problem I have with this is that it makes it too easy to avoid using the tainted war gear, so you find yourself giving them to whichever character just to see what will happen.If they engineered it so that you wouldn't be able to tell what equipment is tainted and maybe the character would get possessed by it making him reluctant to take it off or have some form of withdrawal when you do figure out why your assault squad is going mental then this would have been superb.Best of the 3 by a margin so:8.5/10			",47,7,0,2,9,1,10

												If you liked DOW II, then you'll also like Chaos Rising. It is a nice campaign consisting of 15 missions which allow you to choose your path : Purity or Corruption towards the Emperor of men. You'll get gear to complement your choice too. The campaign works a little differently than in DOW II and you can advance up to level 30. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot. Still, I would have liked to have buildings or to be able to field more units at a time, as in DOW I.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great addition to the original game, you can start your campaign anew from level one or take your former DoW2 campaign from level 20 to the new Max, level 30. Chaos as a main enemy faction is a central feature here, which gives more variety to the battles you may have enjoyed in the original. Missions are more story-driven this time around, and they have added broader unit selection (Vehicles, Dreadnaught, Psyker) which changes things up. New ""Corruption"" dynamic in the game -- where there are minor advantages to staying clean, but quick and pronounced gear and character improvements if you are willing to give chaos purchase on your soul -- which adds meaningful change to the storyline and can have effect on the outcome. Several missions are much harder than I remember the original being. All in all, good purchase -- though I still advise buying the entire franchise during a sale, as the price-point by title is pretty high... ESPECIALLY for this game's sequal, Retribution... which is more expensive and arguably less content. (see that review for details)			",292,82,1,91,36,2,74

												One of my favorite games in my library. Great combat, good characters, interesting story, and one of the best good/evil systems I've seen in that it actually conveys  some of creeping subtlety of corruption and temptation because it will make you more powerful than if you stay pure but will also give you a (predictably) bad ending. Also has really intense and fun battles throughout the campaign with awesome villains. Cannot recommend it enough, especially for any 40k fan.			",50,11,0,25,5,1,30

Welcome to Chaos Rising - where nothing is as it seems. set 10 years after Dawn of War II, the planet Aurelia, for which the sub-sector is named, suddenly gets spit out into the materium. And theres an SOS coming from it, but not all is as it appears. Prepare to relive the fun and excitement of the first game, and the Zeal of the Emperor's chosen, or, the drive of the heretical forces of the chaos space marines, and various warp-spawn and daemons. And in the end, you will uncover something that will start a chapter-wide civil war, and brand the Blood Ravens as tainted, and renegade.			",44,3,0,11,3,0,20

												Good:Warhammer 40k lore and storylineBad: GameplayPathing is bad: units get stuck, bugs include units become unable to move or use skill at allTargeting is bad: units are stupid, and required manual targeting. Bugs include units doing nothing behind coverUnresponsive units: click a ranged skill target enemy, nothing happens, they run to the enemy to melee instead - range units tend to kite forward towards enemyThrew a grenade from bunker targeting enemy, it shows that it explodes in your own bunker, killing your teamCover system - plenty of space in cover, but only can fit 1 of the 3 units in squad. Runs to the other side of the cover (where the enemy is firing from) to take coverGameplay on higher difficulties becomes frustratingBut all these are visibly improved in the retribution expansion - where there is good cover system, responsive units, and good targeting.

												A good expansion for DoW 2, Chaos Rising gives you the option to stay pure in the eyes of the Emperor, or condemn yourself and your sqaudmates to corruption and ultimately (and this is quite amusing) execution at the hands of Gabriel Angelos after he berates and lectures you on your poor choices. In this one, you get different types of supplies, rather than just a general ability refill, so tactical decisions are more challenging. The same interfaces, HUD's, hotkeys, controls and mechanics (including leveling sytem) with more wargear, and of course, more story in this instalment of 40k canon. I loved it. *****			",248,128,0,43,14,2,58

												Chaos Rising is a tremendous addition to an already excellent game. The new campaign is challenging and introduces the corruption mechanic which adds an interesting dimension to character and gear management. The story is a solid continuation of the original, involving new characters and exploring the 40k universe in more depth. As an added bonus, a second co-op option is added in Last Stand, which justified it's own independant release and pits 3 players against waves of 40k enemies horde-style.I would recommend buying and playing DoW II first instead of going standalone since you can carry over your squad and all the gear they earned, but either way if you enjoy one you are almost guaranteed to enjoy the other.

												The game that first took me down the rabbit hole that is WARHAMMER 40000, this is one terrific experience. Quick version: if you like WARHAMMER 40k, buy it. If you like RTS games, buy it. Long version: Dawn of War II Chaos rising is a tight-playing squad-based RTS that feels just right for my brain. The campaign is a ton of fun, with lots of loot to collect and abilities to unlock. You’ll want to tackle multiple playthroughs to try out different character builds. Deliciously campy and fun voice acting abounds. The multiplayer is terrific as well, plus the recent removal of the much hated Games For Windows Live makes it all the sweeter.Get the whole franchise package when it goes on cheap. You’ll get a solid 30 hours at least out of DOW II and its two excellent expansions and never look back.PURGE THE XENOS			",111,8,3,11,7,0,22

												This game is a very good sequel. They kept everything that was good about the previous game, with some fixes to solve other problems.1) DoW2 encouraged you to keep the same party: Not here. Refusing to take some units to some missions will make them corrupted by Chaos.2) DoW2 wasn't very balanced: Sometimes, some weapons were simply better. Why bring a Missile Launcher when Thaddeus and a Thunder Hammer set-up will do it faster, quicker and safer? In this game, nearly every choice is equally good.3) Equipment was easy to sort in DoW2: Not so here. There tends to be a lot of equipment which requires a lot from you. A weapon may be much, much stronger than other weapons, but will corrupt you. Only a little bit at a time, so do you risk it for a mission or two? Other weapons will be unable to be used unless you're completely uncorrupted.There are a lot of other good points, but if you like RTS, play this.			",109,44,0,29,28,1,37

												Honestly, this game is simply a fat XP for the orginal. If you played DoWII, you have played this game. DO NOT think that this downplays your enjoyment experience! Everything that was amazing and fulfilling about DoWII is back, along with new strategic concepts, abilities, gear, a new stat to keep track of and perhaps earn new abilities from, and even a new character.  Your courruption (said new stat) also adds a new dyanamic of difficulty to planning in the game, as certain actions, gear, objectives, and even who you bring along on a mission will affect your corruption level. Will you be the uberbad guy for extra power, or stay loyal to the emperor? Both offer their own added challenges, especially since Corruption becomes harder to earn as you become more corrupt. Care to not be corrupt anymore? You can cleanse yourself, but the road to redemption is not an easy one. Redeeming gear makes you take more damage. Redeeming tasks will often make you hate life as you run off to complete them while facing an entire legion of armor. The campaign is more of the same AWESOME. The abilities are more of the same AWESOME. Same said for characters, stories, and planning. You can make your squad into almost any focus, and you can do so CO-OP. If you do not have this game, and you are on my friends list, BUY IT or I will disown you. If you do not know me, but you LOVE RTS games, Starcraft RPG maps, or anything that makes you think on your feet, GET THIS GAME. If you like MOBAs, GET THIS. It is not a MOBA, but you will easily pick this game up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I preferred this over the first and I'm sure what did it for anyone else who likes this as well as myself is the traitor aspect.  The only problem I have with this is that it makes it too easy to avoid using the tainted war gear, so you find yourself giving them to whichever character just to see what will happen.If they engineered it so that you wouldn't be able to tell what equipment is tainted and maybe the character would get possessed by it making him reluctant to take it off or have some form of withdrawal when you do figure out why your assault squad is going mental then this would have been superb.Best of the 3 by a margin so:8.5/10			",47,7,0,2,9,1,10

												Amazing, fast paced, glamorous RTS game. If you like strategy games such as supreme commander 2 / Empire total war but hate the time it takes to get into epic action, I highly recommend getting this game instead.

												Dawn of War II Chaos Rising is the epic expansion to the Dawn of War franchise. The story takes place one year after the first Aurlien crusade where you (Insert name here comander) and your strike force Tarkus,Cyrus,Avitus,Thaddeus and Davian Thule have been containing little pockets of Ork and Tyranid left overs from the first game. How ever a warp storm entered the Aurelian Sub Sector and popped a planet thought long lost. Aurelia has returned. And a recovery beacon is coming from the surface. After you find out that the beacon was a fake and collecting a librarian by the name of Johna Orion. Soon the system is embroiled in war again and its your choice to stay pure and save the imperial forces in the sub sector or become a traitor and slaughter all who get in your way.The game is similar to its first game but instead of just revovering all your items from crates such as Med kits, Grenades and explosive charges are all distunighused by there own making a certain randomness to the game sometimes helpful sometimes not balancing your strike teams.You gain a new unit the Librarian Johna Orion a powerful psyker who adds the ability power and can be built for support or full on assault with his abilities.With the new systems in the game you get new abilities for each unit once you begin leveling up your characters,But there is a catch to the new systems. Coruption.Coruption and purity is two seperate secondary objectives in most missons. Staying pure is good because you keep Davian Thule and you gain support from fellow forces of loyalists. If you go coruption your forces start gaining buffs to dammage and health but they become vunerable to the weaknesses of your enemies watch out.  With more corruption your characters start gaining chaos abilities such as spawing demons or increasing your battle dammage in a blood lusted craze.Of course going evil if fun but it depends on how you like playing. If you stay pure fellow loyalists will fight with you and never attack you. Sadly if you go coruption you dont just lose Davian you lose any support and become attacked by loyalists. Going evil has its catches but staying good makes you a bit weaker. Its what ever your choice the game never asks you to do any secondary objective as mandatory its all up to you and it does not change the out come of the misson but it does effect your squad conversations.Of course Equipment is unlocked, found or repaired by the tech marine on board your ship. But coruption is every where and so is redemption. Redeeming gear usualy is a handi cap such as -25 armour or character takes more dammage in close combat they are shown as gold.  Coruption items are shown as red and usualy give huge buffs but degrade over time and some items of coruption are specific to some characters some like a special traitor bolt gun only avaible to Tarkus.The new chaos army in the game also shows how much evil has come into the game. They are supported by the dark god Nurgle, Khorne, and Thzeentch. With new abilities and balancing ques each army got a boost to keep up with the Chaos army.All in I give this game 8.5 out of 10 the game is short could use some more story elements like what do the characters think of the return of the planet Aurelia or what they think during there coruption. The difficulty is also leaning on the unfair side sometimes with the last mission and two others beining rediculos in some points.Still good game get it if you love Rpgs or strategy.

												This is probably one of the better games in the Dawn of War 2 series. It is technically a stand alone, but it's the same exe file as the orignal DOW2. Think of it as either an expansion pack or a really big DLC.The Good:+If you played the original's campaign, you can import the save file and redistribute ALL of your stats at the begining of the campaign. If not, no biggie.+Your choices in the campaign matter... sort of. The missions don't change a whole lot, but there are 4 different endings and tons of changes in wargear and abilities.+The campaign is a blast. Except the final boss... which is hard... like it should be.+Multiplayer is just as fun, and throwing chaos into the mix only makes it better.+Chaos commanders change the abilities of cultists, making for some cool combos.+Your units alive and controlling the map matter, A lot. Most RTS games are about building bases and armies so you can squash your enemy. This one is about starving them of resources and kills. Kind of like a MOBA...The Bad-If you didn't have a save file from the last game... good luck on Primarch difficulty. I hear that makes it much harder.-Campaign strategies do not translate well (or at all) into multiplayer-Multiplayer matchups are brutal to first timers. -The ""intelligence"" gap between the ""easy"" and ""normal"" AI is brutal. Final Thoughs:This game is fun. I reccomend it for both the challenge of the campaign (at higher levels) and the multiplayer. The concept is great and it's a breath of fresh air from other RTS games. It has some interesting mechanics, like the general lack of base building and global commander abilities. Finding a balance between vision control, keeping units alive, killing stuff, and the general struggle for resources is challenging, but rewarding.			",15,1,1,2,2,0,11

												While not as long as Dawn of War II, Chaos Rising makes up for it with increased depth in the form of the new corruption system. Now certain weapons that you use or actions that you take will lead to increasing your character's alignment with Chaos, giving them new abilities in exchange for betraying their oath to the Emperor. This feeds into several different gameplay scenarios and multiple endings, based on how corrupt you are throughout the game. There are also new abilities (both passive and active) and a level cap of thirty when you carry over your characters from Dawn of War 2. Chaos Rising is a worthy expansion to its predecessor and if you loved DW2 then you'll see it as a welcome return to the Blood Ravens.			",107,19,0,13,2,1,14

												This game's setting is beautifully integrated into the Warhammer 40K universe. Especially the campaign is well scripted and fits to the dark futuristic theme, that is so typical for the Franchise.The troups and the different races of the Warhammer 40K universe are well projected into this real time stragegie game, with their specific abilities, troup types and weaponery.The only thing that I found quite anoying was the long opening szene that plays everytime you open the game if you don't skip it. It is exiting to watch the first time, but I don't need to watch it over and over again everytime I want to play.If you are a fan of the table top game or other Warhammer 40K games, you will definately love this one!

												One of my favorite games in my library. Great combat, good characters, interesting story, and one of the best good/evil systems I've seen in that it actually conveys  some of creeping subtlety of corruption and temptation because it will make you more powerful than if you stay pure but will also give you a (predictably) bad ending. Also has really intense and fun battles throughout the campaign with awesome villains. Cannot recommend it enough, especially for any 40k fan.			",50,11,0,25,5,1,30

												A bit short, but none the less very engaging follow on from classic DOW II.Gear was a little sparse on my playthrough and many of my squads didnt actually upgrade key items, still i found myself devastating everything but Martellus and Ulkair, those two gave me a little more trouble.Again, the game is still highly centric on your strategy, though unlike classic DOW II you will find yourself able to brute force your way through certain segments of the rather short campaign (as long as you dont give an eff about corruption / purity.)Some missions contained ""Forced deployment"" which basically means, if you dont send someone along with the deployment, they gain corruption - thats fine if you want them to, not so good if you dont :PCorruption and Purity were an interesting concept, there are very few pieces that you can get though without some serious ramifications for your actions and alot of the wargear you will loot is corrupted, some of this can be turned in for more powerful corrupted gear and others can be turned in for purified gear with a ""Redemption"" bonus, if you wish to wear said gear that is entirely up to you but, some pieces do require prexisiting corruption on the squad.All in all, still something id recommend - now onto retribution...

												While the gameplay is exactly like Dawn of War 2, Chaos Rising adds the Chaos Space Marines and the story itself is much darker in very aspect. All I can say is that this is pretty much what you can expect in a expansion. If you truly want the Warhammer 40k experience, get Retribution or Space Marine. This is only a must for those who want to continue the story from Dawn of War 2 and know more backstory going in Retribution.			",86,10,0,23,12,1,42

												Interesting add-on to the not-bad-at-all sequel. Planet Aurelia returns from the warp storm, chaos forces join the struggle, plot thickens. Essentialy, it's more of the same: if you liked WH40K:DoW II, you'll like Chaos Rising. More levels, more wargear, more maps, more options. And still no stupid your-typical-RTS stuff. It's really a shame they made Retribution so... generic.			",97,52,1,43,24,3,41

												Chaos Rising is Relic's first foray into expanding DoW II, and seems to be a return to conventional exp antics, with one new race and a small campaign, ala Winter Assault. The story of the Blood Ravens and their exploits continues and strange happenings occur in Sub Sector Aurelia, even among loyalist forces, even among the Blood Ravens themselves..... Of course, the meddlings are due to Chaos, and the campaign continues to see your quartet be heroic and level up to 30, becoming absurdly powerful as they go. The interesting addition however is the element of corruption via decisions made in the campaign, which can offer many powerful rewards, but will have effects upon the story, which can end in as many as 6 different ways, depending on this.The rest of the game is of course, improved and refined, but unfortunately all made redundant with the release of Retribution. Still, if you can get all the games in an all in one DoW II value pack, the campaign is worth playing.			",184,23,3,7,23,2,71

												It all started when our protagonist, Civ 5, woke up in a pumpkin patch. It was the fourth time it had happened. Feeling ridiculously exasperated, Civ 5 groped a sock, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Unexpectedly, he realized that his beloved ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was missing! Immediately he called his friend, Leroy Jenkins. Civ 5 had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) one million years, the majority of which were sassy ones. Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was intelligent though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Civ 5 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very happy Civ 5. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured him that most koalas yawn before mating, yet otters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Civ 5. Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Civ 5? Because he had snuck out from Civ 5's with the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth only four days prior. It was a saucy little ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth... how could he resist?It didn't take long before Civ 5 got back to the subject at hand: his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited him over, assuring him they'd find the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Civ 5 grabbed his desk and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and he had to do it thoughtfully. He figured that if Civ 5 took the truck, he had take at least eleven minutes before Civ 5 would get there. But if he took the ♥♥♥? Then Leroy Jenkins would be alarmingly screwed.Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by seven abrasive aligators that were lured by his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins sighed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he thoughtfully reached for his mitten and aptly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the thicket, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief. That's when he heard the ♥♥♥ rolling up. It was Civ 5.----o0o---- As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Wal-Mart to pick up a 12-pack of pencils, so he knew he was running late. With a calculated leap, Civ 5 was out of the ♥♥♥ and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door. Meanwhile inside, Leroy Jenkins was panicking. Not thinking, he tossed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth into a box of mittens and then slid the box behind his piano. Leroy Jenkins was concerned but at least the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was concealed. The doorbell rang.'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins sassily purred. With a careful push, Civ 5 opened the door. 'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling maniac in a Vette,' he lied. 'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured him. Civ 5 took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. Leroy Jenkins cringed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness. 'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted. But Civ 5 was distracted. Without warning, Leroy Jenkins noticed a selfish look on Civ 5's face. Civ 5 slowly opened his mouth to speak.'...What's that smell?'Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his butt when Civ 5 asked this. In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what? I don't smell anything..!' A lie. A insensitive look started to form on Civ 5's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's mittens from when she used to have pet bunnies. She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Civ 5 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Civ 5 randomly lunged toward the box and opened it. The ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was plainly in view.Civ 5 stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four seconds. Unexpectedly, Leroy Jenkins groped wildly in Civ 5's direction, clearly desperate. Civ 5 grabbed the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth and bolted for the door. It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a eccentric chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Civ 5,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little insensitive, so Civ 5 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking mittens at him or something. All of a sudden, he gripped his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell? That seemed excessive. The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Civ 5. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Civ 5. 'Oh. You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Civ 5 was gone.----o0o---- Just yonder, Civ 5 was struggling to make his way through the pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Civ 5 had severely hurt his arm during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength. Another pack of feral aligators suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. One by one they latched on to Civ 5. Already weakened from his injury, Civ 5 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed. The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of aligators running off with his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth.About seven hours later, Civ 5 awoke, his butt throbbing. It was dark and Civ 5 did not know where he was. Deep in the humid desert, Civ 5 was abundantly lost. A few minutes later, he remembered that his ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth was taken by the aligators. But at that point, he was just thankful for his life. That's when, to his horror, a oversized aligator emerged from the cornfield. It was the alpha aligator. Civ 5 opened his mouth to scream but was cut short when the aligator sunk its teeth into Civ 5's face. With a faint groan, the life escaped from Civ 5's lungs, but not before he realized that he was a failure.Less than two miles away, Leroy Jenkins was entombed by anguish over the loss of the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth. 'MY PRECIOUS!!' he cried, as he reached for a sharpened spoon. With a heroic thrust, he buried it deeply into his neck. As the room began to fade to black, he thought about Civ 5... wishing he had found the courage to tell him that he loved him. But he would die alone that day. All that remained was the ♥♥♥♥♥ of truth that had turned them against each other, ultimately causing their demise. And as the dew on melancholy sappling branches began to reflect the dawn's reddish glare, all that could be heard was the chilling cry of distant aligators, desecrating all things sacred to virtuous men, and perpetuating an evil that would reign for centuries to come. Our heroes would've lived unhappily ever after, but they were too busy being dead. So, no one lived forever after, the end. :'(			",153,15,0,15,9,3,19

												A good expansion for DoW 2, Chaos Rising gives you the option to stay pure in the eyes of the Emperor, or condemn yourself and your sqaudmates to corruption and ultimately (and this is quite amusing) execution at the hands of Gabriel Angelos after he berates and lectures you on your poor choices. In this one, you get different types of supplies, rather than just a general ability refill, so tactical decisions are more challenging. The same interfaces, HUD's, hotkeys, controls and mechanics (including leveling sytem) with more wargear, and of course, more story in this instalment of 40k canon.

												Gnarly real-time tactical squad strategy game. Control wise it is similar to other RTS such as StarCraft and Command and Conquer. The similarities end there, as you control only a small squad of soldiers with no large-army management or base building. Instead the focus is on pure combat with lots of micro'ing your squad units. Fast-paced and brutally difficult on the highest setting, its a fantastic and unique game, mildly reminiscient of X-COM.			",194,36,2,29,8,0,32

												Breaking away from the traditions of the first Dawn of War, this second instillation of the classic and iconic RTS brings a new bold RPG element to it's gameplay. Borrowing game mechanics from hero-based strategy's such as DOTA and Leauge of Legends, Dawn of War II and it's expansions are based around hero units with special and dynamic abilites as well as a few supporting squads of infantry/vehicles. Do not be deterred by this change of pace, the action and combat is fluid and quite manageable. Loot drops and hero unit skill trees bring the player a close connection with the units on screen, and at times you'll find yourself praising whichever deity/ideal as you mow down your enemies with superior tactics!Overhauling the graphics engine, the visuals in this game have never looked better. THQ's and Relic's attention to detail with unit design, level design, and user interface is rivaled by few, and the developing duo captures the spirit of the Warhammer 40,000 universe once again! This is a must-play for Warhammer 40,000 fans, and the gameplay is very player-friendly, allowing newcomers to RTS's to learn the ropes quickly. In a nutshell: A second Dawn of War? What's not to like?!			",22,2,0,0,0,0,6

												As with the original game, I loved what they did with the campaign which was fairly bad in the first installment. I enjoyed the Chaos Rising Campaign even more then the original. The added people for the multiplayer mode was nice as well. Although, as I said before, I feel like they completely gimped their multiplayer. Other then that, this is a great game.

												The game that first took me down the rabbit hole that is WARHAMMER 40000, this is one terrific experience. Quick version: if you like WARHAMMER 40k, buy it. If you like RTS games, buy it. Long version: Dawn of War II Chaos rising is a tight-playing squad-based RTS that feels just right for my brain. The campaign is a ton of fun, with lots of loot to collect and abilities to unlock. You’ll want to tackle multiple playthroughs to try out different character builds. Deliciously campy and fun voice acting abounds. The multiplayer is terrific as well, plus the recent removal of the much hated Games For Windows Live makes it all the sweeter.Get the whole franchise package when it goes on cheap. You’ll get a solid 30 hours at least out of DOW II and its two excellent expansions and never look back.PURGE THE XENOS			",111,8,3,11,7,0,22

												This game is a very good sequel. They kept everything that was good about the previous game, with some fixes to solve other problems.1) DoW2 encouraged you to keep the same party: Not here. Refusing to take some units to some missions will make them corrupted by Chaos.2) DoW2 wasn't very balanced: Sometimes, some weapons were simply better. Why bring a Missile Launcher when Thaddeus and a Thunder Hammer set-up will do it faster, quicker and safer? In this game, nearly every choice is equally good.3) Equipment was easy to sort in DoW2: Not so here. There tends to be a lot of equipment which requires a lot from you. A weapon may be much, much stronger than other weapons, but will corrupt you. Only a little bit at a time, so do you risk it for a mission or two? Other weapons will be unable to be used unless you're completely uncorrupted.There are a lot of other good points, but if you like RTS, play this.			",109,44,0,29,28,1,37

It is also very annoying when you have to retreat your troops every 2 seconds. However I LOVE Warhammer Tabletop I don't like this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn of War II was a nice surprise. Breaking away from the regular mold of RTS games to create something more action oriented was a bold move that paid off. The campaign had a lot of hectic moments and offered some interesting RPG elements to help build a sense of progression throughout it's missions.Chaos Rising takes that RPG-lite system a step further and introduces some branching paths to the games various missions. Doing certain objectives (or failing to do them) may ""corrupt"" your squad, which can unlock more Chaos oriented abilities. You also have the reverse, which is Redemption points. It brings a further level of depth to how you can tackle missions, as well as introducing slight alterations to the story based on your choices.The story is also dramatically improved over what the base game had. It deals with the uprising of the Chaos Space Marines and how one of your own may be a traitor. While you can't directly fail a mission, some of the scenarios are out of your control, in terms of victory. You fight unending odds and need to retreat, which ramps up the tension quite a bit.It all ends with a twist that you shape based on your choices, but it's never directly stated how that works. It makes for a far more realistic take on the morality systems usually in place of RPG systems. Losing one of your finest squadmates to Chaos can be a devastating blow and knowing you could have prevented it makes it more agonizing.As far as the general gameplay goes, there aren't really any new additions (aside from Corruption/Redemption). Everything functions the same and you still can collect gear to improve your squads. You have a new Hero in the form of The Librarian. He acts has a healer and a ranged caster, which can help tremendously in the more closed off environments in the campaign.There are some missions reminiscent of the atmosphere that the Alien films made famous. You will be traversing through derelict vessels looking for Bio-samples and other materials. Ambushes are frequent and your squad is often outnumbered, so a strong emphasis is put on tactical manuevers more so than brute force.The campaign is about half the length of the main game, which is a plus and a negative. While the main game became a bit repetitive towards the end, Chaos Rising seems to teter between being excellent and being bland. While the Corruption/Redemption mechanic does allow for different approaches to certain objectives, they almost always culminate in a boss battle.The general difficulty is also much higher than the main game. It makes for certain missions that feel a bit cheap, as you often just don't have the manpower to overcome the odds. Since you can't build units on the fly, you're often forced to retreat and wait for reinforcements. It makes some missions take upwards of 30 minutes to complete, which just drags out the pacing.Overall, I think the campaign is better, but it does have more problems. It's not a bad attempt at expanding the groundwork set in Dawn of War II, but more could have been done to keep the consistency of quality at a high level. Still, more of the same would have been sufficient, so I admire Relic for attempting to mix things up.As I said in my review for the base game, the multiplayer is practically non-existent. I believe that is more down to the second expansion, Retribution, being the first Dawn of War II title on Steamworks. Chaos Rising and the base game were added to Steamworks only 2 years ago, but that was 3 years after Retribution released.While I couldn't find any games for co-op or competitive, the functionality is present. That means the co-op campaign is an option for people who want to bring a friend along. It would probably mitigate some of the difficulty concerns I had, but it would also be cool to tinker with the morality system with a buddy.Regardless, I would call this expansion unessential. It isn't bad, but it's mostly for the more hardcore of fans. Dawn of War II provides basically everything this game has, save for the Chaos Space Marines. If you really want, you could just get Retribution, which includes a campaign for every race.You could do much worse, though.7.5/10			",388,51,7,30,13,4,36

												Just like its predecessor, it’s another good game, perhaps, much shorter, but still good. The inclusion of Jonah Orion doesn’t feel that good since he already starts at a lower level and his powers don’t seem that good nor he seems too relevant to the story. Corruption is another inclusion to the game, it’s interesting the way its presented in the missions, but ultimately, it can be easily avoided or redeemed, too easily perhaps. The ending sets an interesting ring for the civil war that plagues the chapter.			",158,55,2,69,9,2,45

												The game is good (levels) but This game is a DLC, even though it is not mentioned, you this need the full game to play the others races(""Dawn of War II"")3/10I do not understand because the producers have created 3 games of Dawn of War IIinstead of creating the one game and make the DLC to continue the story and add more unit and races(necron,tau,dark eldar) on multiplayer.I am ashamed to have it in the library.

												Slick well polished RTS that focuses heavily upon squad tactics over resource management. Successfully cuts down some of the more intricate features found in the original Dawn of War, while retaining a satisfying Warhammer experience.			",396,61,7,30,26,1,34

												""And we shall know no fear"" as the Space Marines say.This expansion pack to Dawn of War II was well made, complete with a very unexpected plot twist. However it was still a short game and I disliked the corruption system though I thought that added more realism to the game (Basically if squads do certain missions, fail to do objectives or do types of objectives as well as equiping types of armour and weapons, some/ all squads will gain corruption. Please note that I haven't explained the advantages and disadvantages of corruption)The final level wasn't disapointing however the boss was very over powered (People who completed Final Fantasy XIII will know what I'm talking about). It took me more than one attempt to complete it (I was playing the game on Sergent which is normal I believe) and I had to use some abilities over and over again which added more corruption to my squad but considering it the last mission in the game I didn't really care about it and I was desperate to start playing DoW II Retribution. The corruption system and the last level is the only things about this game that I disliked. I can't express all my views on this game but I probably wouldn't play it again for a while. But overall I really enjoyed it, I recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought the master collection of Dawn of War and i really appreciated it, in my opinion the best of these 3 is without doubt Dawn of War II, but Chaos Rising has some interesting things.PROS:-Continue your Dawn of War II campaign (i found that fantastic)-A lot of new weapons and armours -Corruption or Redemption (corruption at max offers a different end)-Lore (is always interesting to follow the lore of space marines)CONS:-REALLY short (i completed the campaign in less than 7 hours) -Not as good as Dawn of War III bought them all because i really enjoy this genre, i reccomend this game only to continue this series, but i higlhy reccomend the first Chapter.HINT SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER!At some point you'll realize that traitor you're looking for is one of your squad mates, it's hard to find the true one. If one of your squad has a high Corruption level then that squad is the traitor, but if none of your squads has corruption then it's Martellus, which makes no sense because appears in Dawn of War Retribution. The traitor is Avitus.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Your slavery to the False Emperor ends today! Welcome to Chaos Rising - where nothing is as it seems. set 10 years after Dawn of War II, the planet Aurelia, for which the sub-sector is named, suddenly gets spit out into the materium. And theres an SOS coming from it, but not all is as it appears. Prepare to relive the fun and excitement of the first game, and the Zeal of the Emperor's chosen, or, the drive of the heretical forces of the chaos space marines, and various warp-spawn and daemons. And in the end, you will uncover something that will start a chapter-wide civil war, and brand the Blood Ravens as tainted, and renegade.			",44,3,0,11,3,0,20
