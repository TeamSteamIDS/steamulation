												This Addon will add a new British Campaign and some new British units.. If you like ArmA 2 then you should get this addon too. However i must add that i think this addon is abit short when it comes to new vehicles. You'll get the Warrior IFV as their stronges unit, The Jackals and Land Rovers as Light vehicles and some new helicopters.As far as i know the Brits have alot more equipment then this, where are all the Chally's?If you got ArmA 2 and don't know what to think of the game, pass on this and get Arrowhead instead.

												Arma 2: British Armed Forces is a very nice, polished DLC. I enjoyed playing through the campaign, and the single missions are also brilliant. A little touch that I liked was being able to play as the Parachute Regiment :)Pros:-Good campaign-L85s and L86s are very realistic-It's nice that they included things like the Quadbike and the WMIK variants.-Good single missionsCons:There aren't many, to be honest.-Your troops still use American tactics. Crawling is far too loud, the British Army uses Leopard crawling which is silent, and a technique for running on all fours, which is incredibly fast if done correctly. I'd have liked to see this in game, as sometimes it just feels like even more marines dressed in DPMs and putting on accents, and the British Army works VERY differently to the US Army, which I feel could be appreciated more.-No tanks! The BAF use Jackals, Snatches, Quads and Warriors... But no Challies. At the point where I've got to in the campaign, e.g. section-scale assaults and platoon houses, it makes sense to simply have the Jackals, but in the single missions and multiplayer it still feels insufficient only having APCs against Soviet heavy tanks. I've seen Warriors take out WW2 T-45s in game, but facing off with T-70s seems slightly ridiculous, although this is balanced out by the upgraded WAH-64D and the JTAC class, as well as the fact that in the campaign it's similar to the Afghanistan insurgency- Infantry and sometimes trucks, nothing heavier.Still, The Challenger 2 is actually superior to the Abrams in the kind of war that Arma 2 and the expansions portray, so it would have made a brilliant addition to supplement the well-made infantry and air power.Overall, Arma 2: BAF is worth buying. I made a big point about tanks and dressup-yanks but it doesn't make much of a difference. BAF is worth it, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Arma 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arma 2: British Armed Forces (BAF) is a first person shooter simulation game developed and published by Bohemia Interactive and released in August 2010. BAF follows the events of Operation Arrowhead when you successfully overthrow the Takistani regime. In this DLC, the British forces commence Operation Crimson Lance to control the rising insurgent activity in post-OA Takistan. You play as Brian Frost, who coordinates with various British squads to accomplish objectives.  Campaign  In Operation Crimson Lance, you play as Brian Frost. Frost comes across as a completely likeable individual because BAF's dialogue represents him as a driven individual for his nation and also an individual that cares for the mental and physical safety of his teammates. Furthermore, the game successfully attempts to incorporate some personality into Frost's teammates through their heavy British accents. For instance, Frost surprisingly meets an old friend 'Tanny' at the start of a mission. His surprise feels rewarding because it shows that in a short campaign, Bohemia managed to meaningfully and briefly explore the backgrounds and expose the personalities of the main characters such as Frost.Regarding length, BAF features a storyline-driven four mission campaign. I completed BAF in 5.5 hours, which is a reasonable length. I think there should have been more length to the campaign, however what Bohemia presents is quality. The game excels in realism through its focus on communication and teamwork. For instance, your squad cooperates with other British teams to plan and execute missions. Random events also occur that help or hurt you further into the game.  For example, if you decide to help out an individual who had his goods stolen by an insurgent, then he will gather local troops and help you in further missions. If you do not help him, following missions become more difficult. In other words, you are presented with choice and it can affect the game. The game also incorporates a strong soundtrack that features a compilation of rock and Arab instrumentals into various songs.   Issues  BAF feels more tighter and polished compared to Army of the Czech Republic DLC. I did not experience any random bugs and glitches that harm the progression of the game or the enjoyment of the game, so I feel that this was more accomplished in that regard. Regarding AI, the AI feels more reactive towards your commands. However, while better than Czechia DLC, AI driving  still is horrible.  Conclusion  Arma 2: British Armed Forces is a very good DLC. It features a strong four mission campaign that shines in presenting Brian Frost and his personality and background. Missions also vary with optional side missions and missions depend on cooperation and communication. There is also a good soundtrack that complements the environment and operation. My only issue was the AI driving behaviour. I recommend this DLC because it expands on the overall Arma 2 story in Takistan while adding some fresh content to the game. At $8.99, you can't go wrong with this.  Rating  8.5/10  Pros  	- Operation Crimson Lance storyline.	- Background and personality of characters.	- In-game side missions that present choice to the player.	- Soundtrack.  Cons  	- Friendly AI driving still is poor.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Since I'm from the UK, as soon as I saw BAF up on the Steam store I knew I had to have it. I wasn't dissapointed. There's a certain joy when using your countries armed forces in a video game and there is a definite joy when it's in a game such as ARMA II.As for the DLC itself, they do have British voice actors for to give the troops extra authenticity and the uniforms/weapons/veichles have been meticiously recreated in the game. It adds two new CTI modes for both Takistan and Chernarus. It adds some new scenarios to play in CO-OP and SP as well. It also adds a scotland braveheart facepaint for your profile under the name William W. which is an obvious nod to William Wallace.However it's not all sunshine and rainbows, there's no BAF tanks. This means that late-game CTI as the British is gimped seeing as how the other forces can pump out tanks.Overall, if you want to breathe some new life into ARMA II then you should get this. Trying out all the new veichles and guns is fun as well as playing the new scenarios. It's best to get this on sale, with the PMC and Czech Army DLC too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(I should probably make it clear that I have 0.0 hours recorded since I play this through Operation Arrowhead rather than going straight to BAF in the library. Just in case anyone's confused.)Offers a nice SP experience, got it on sale for 1.79. I personally like that it's more focused on taking down insurgencies and whatnot, similar to the situation NATO's facing in Afghanistan today. As made clear in the title, you take control of British forces, putting down insurgent activity in Takistan after the events of Operation Arrowhead. Not much given in the way of vehicles, from what I heard. I can't really verify myself since I'm not very knowledgeable on the British military's arsenal, but I like what they have to offer. There's the Merlin transport chopper, the Wildcat attack heli, some armored vehicles that I don't rightly recall the names of at this time, and infantry in MTP/woodland/desert camo patterns. I'm probably missing some more, but you get the gist of it. Again, I'd personally recommend picking it up on sale like I did just to save as much as possible, but for the base price, can't say it's that bad if you're looking for more single-player missions to fiddle with.

												For the record It mounts onto Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead thus the low play time on it individually.This improves texture quality a fair amount. You should get it for more weapons, an extra retextured backpack, more clothing variety and some overhauled Arma 2 textures. Other than it's content feels kind of small compared to the PMC pack and doesn't really stand on it's own.			",246,13,3,8,1,0,2

												I checked out the free version of Arma II and would recommend anyone whose played it and enjoyed the experience to  go upgrade to the paid version. The graphics are one of the things that let the  free version down in my opinion as you lose the high density textures.  If you like the game play   the next step would be to go  kick some♥♥♥♥♥in beautifully rendered countryside of central Europe; (The forests are amazing), or the  semi deserts of the pseudo Russian Steppes. The commercial version is much more polished and has all of the extra content. Get the complete package   with the 10 year Anniversary edition and they even throw in the game that started it all, Operation Flashpoint, All the ArmA games have 6 Degrees of Freedom which means they work with the Track IR a fantastic piece of motion detector gear that allows you to look around in your environment and is brilliant when flying choppers and jets.The whole franchise is amazing and  is the best mil sim  ever made.

												The British Armed Forces addon brings in a new map, new units, and new weapons in addition to a new campaign. Shapur is kind of small, but still well made and the weapons are your typical Tommy offerings. The units are a good alternative to the usual US Forces for mission making. The biggest downside is that the campaign is not cooperative, which it would've benefited greatly from. In all, this is a great DLC pack for ArmA 2.			",249,12,16,13,48,2,43

												Out of all the DLC's for the game, this is THE single most worthy of buying if you are planning on going on any at all. Troops are beautifully modeled, there are desert, woodland and mixed camo's aswell as vehicles. A very well made addon, along with a whole british campaign too.. If you have Operation arrowhead, then I'd say this is a must.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
