												It's just a turn-based version of Galcon, but with ugly sprites. There's really no reason to get it.			",727,219,17,92,70,7,105

												Don't be fooled by the claims that this is a 4X. This is one of those sort of games where you get a set number of counters on your spaces, which you then move all of to another space, and whoever has the most there wins it. It's been done before, and much better than this. There are none of the standard 4X trappings and the space theme is throwaway at best.If you want to play a game like this, get Eufloria instead.

												It's a basic but very enjoyable and fun indie-game with some strategy elements and appears to be fun with friends for some casual gaming.Although, it lacks any sense of progression, it's still quite fun and sucks you in to the extent that you just lose track of how much time you've played.It may not be everyone's thing, but I highly recommend checking it out.However, I do have an issue with the $9.99 dollar price tag; at most, it should be for $5.00 dollars because it's not particurally feature rich, and not a whole ot of people even bother with playing online with the game, if any at all.It's a dead game in terms of updates; however, this doesn't mean the game is buggy, it seems to be fairly polished with the exception of weird AI behavior at timesand the fact that the game can be easy sauce when using simple strategies such as only holding a few planets and ""upgrading"" them and ammasing a ton of ships just to roflstomp your enemies.

												There's a clone of this game on Desura called ""10 min space strategy"" with many more gameplay elements, factions, and quirks to choose from, and it's free.  Play that instead.In all seriousness, this is a bare-bones game that allows one to build hordes of fighters and throw them at enemy planets.  Once you kill all of the other guy's starships, you win.  If you would like some tactical depth, then the best option is to do nothing for several turns and then react once the enemy starts throwing more mobs at you.If you're desperate for a time sink, I suppose it's better than just sleeping all day.

												This is the answer to, ""What if GalCon Fusion was turn-based?"" I like it, because I'm an old turn-based kind-of-guy. It's not terribly deep gameplay, but if you want a quick diversion that doesn't require a huge commitment, this is nice.			",443,114,3,95,51,1,103

												Mayhem Intergalactic is a very simple Risk-lite and it presents itself as such.  Easy to pickup and the AI (at the Highest setting) provides a reasonable challenge while understanding the mechanics. While some extra UI polish & Numpad support would help, the game is functional and the build & conquer mechanic is classically enjoyable.However, Mayhem Intergalactic feels like a game built for a community. As with many indie titles, any previously existing community has moved on and I cannot recommend it for this reason.			",616,196,24,88,51,11,98

												I really adore this game. When I have those days where just nothing is fun, I play this.Its so simple yet has enough options to make the game play vary from fast paced to totally casual and there is no fluff to get in the way. The small size of the binary makes it quick and easy to play anywhere too!One of my top ten steam games.			",908,371,19,154,173,5,253

												Mayhem Intergalactic is a fun update to a classic game type. To win, a player must eliminate all enemy starships and planets. Planets produce starships, which can be sent to other planets to conquer or bolster defenses. The tricky part is that space travel can take multiple turns. Two fleets might pass one another on long voyages, leaving an undefended planet for attackers to conquer while the planet that fleet departed from gets demolished by the enemy fleet that just left the planet they attacked. If it sounds confusing, it can be odd to try to outthink your opponents to attack them but defend your own holdings, but there's no tech tree or micromanagement to handle. This is one of those simple yet complex fun to play games. The graphics are decent, the music and sound are good, and its mechanics, controls, and help are solid. Mayhem Intergalactic's well worth a few bucks for a bit of mental exercise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
