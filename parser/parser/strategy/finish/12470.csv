												While the game is brilliant, it should be made known that it isn't really compatible with anything over Windows XP. This was working for me on Windows 7 64bit using an ATI gfx card but since updating it past 14.1 the game no longer works. I can get the game to boot onto the main menu screen but none of the selectable menu buttons are visable. On the Port Royale 2 fansite they state there is two option available, either play it on XP or buy the 'Reloaded' version. I guess Steam doesn't have that version.I have since managed to get the game working, here's how:1) (Possibly optional) Try setting your launch options as ""-32bit"" (without quotations)2) Select browse local files for Port Royale 2 from the Steam menu, scroll down and right click PR2.exe and select Properties and then select compatibility mode for Windows 98/Windows ME, then click apply.  3) Finally change your desktop resolution to 1280x720 (this is the key part). You may also find that simply by changing your desktop resolution to 1280x720 that you won't have to bother with the other options.			",84,1,10,4,5,0,16

												i feel i can write a honest review on this game seeing as i have over 1200+ hours on my none steam version.. this game has  by far the best economic engine in any game iv ever played.. and is one of the best business simulators also.... as far as the actual sea battles themselves... iv seen better. but that still is only a small part of the game.. this game is VERY adictive if you are a greedy person (i know i am).... (you will loose your job, your dog will die of starvation, you wife/GF will leave you, you will fail school, when you come outside after playing  the wolrd will have gone through 2 more world wars... as far as all the people giving bad review because the game ""wont run on win 7/8"" thats bullsh*t. there is a very simple fix for that on the form.. i would rate this game a 9.4/10			",57,3,2,5,9,0,8

												There is no better economic simulator that exists that I know of. There are many good City Sims and Tycoon style games that wish they had the economic engine behind this game. Every one of the 65+ cities in this game have unique features and needs based on a complex mix of random events and your ability to supply them. I could go on and on about the complex yet easier to comprehend industry and economic simulation in this game, it is that engrossing and one of a kind. I am actually upset PR3 was so terrible compared to this gem.On top of the amazing economic simulation, there is a pretty decent ship-ship, ship-shore, & shore-shore combat engine. It is no Pirates! but for the game being more a trading sim that a ship combat sim it add a whole new dimension when the trading gets a little stale. Chasing Pirates and Taking over cities for a friendly Viceroy is not a bad pass time either.  I actually wrote the first comphrehensive walkthrough for this game back in 2005. Under the name (GeneralNic) it will get you up and running and getting a few trade routes on auto-trade so you can focus on ship combat or setting up another zone of the trade and dominating another resource. (Hint) once you have a few lucrative trade routes set up, but a book on the space bar and leave it over night, I woke up with 2 Billion gold and had no trouble taking the Carribean in the name of the Dutch!

												A very engrossing and very deep 17th century economic simulator.  You start as a small time trader with a small ship, a warehouse, and a purse of gold. From there you buy goods cheaply at one port and sail off to other ports and hope to find one that will buy those goods at a high price. Once you obtain enough capital you increase in rank. Rank increases allow you to hire more captains to have separate fleets, and obtain more building permits in different ports. The economic depth is amazing. Each port is capable of producing 5 different goods. Some goods production is dependant on having a supply of another good, and that's where you the trader comes in. Do you want to buy rope from Port A? Then they need a good supply of hemp from Port B. Furthermore, once you obtain a building permit in a particular port you can become a greater part of the local economy by building your own warehouse and then manufacturing facilities. If you are smart enough and have the gold you can buy basic crop plantations in one port, produce that good cheaply, haul the goods to your advanced manufacturing facility at another port to cheaply produce the finished good and sell it for a massive profit. For extra profit you can also build housing for the new workers for your faciliteis and have them pay you rent. You also make money buy shipping in surplus workers from other ports to the port that now needs those workers. Not that there aren't plenty of obstacles to stand in your way. When the game starts out in free play there are no pirates active and no nations are at at war.  As the game progresses the four nations, Spain, France, England, and the Netherlands can and will end up at war with each other. You can attempt to stay friendly with each nation and continue selling to all sides or offer to help one side over the other by raiding ship, blockading ports, and attacking ports.  Doing so rewards you, but at the cost of not being able to do business with the other nation until you repair your status with them. Piracy is your other main concern. Pirates start off weak, with a single ship, but quickly grow to a major problem. They will sack ships, and invade ports. The sacking of ports is of great concern if you have a warehouse in that town as they will steal all of your stored goods, otherwise it is a great opportunity to sell the newly ravaged port fresh supplies. You can mitigate the risk of having your favorite port raided by pirates and enemy nations by donating cannons and paying for soldiers at your personal expense, and it is VERY expensive, so don't bother until you are wealthy and have something worth protecting. You could try to kill the pirates, but the game will not let you attack the pirates base until it randomly shows up on the map. Once you do know the secret location you must have a both a massive (expensive) battlefleet and a letter of Marquee allowing you to attack them. Why you need permission to kill non-Marquee Letter holding pirates is a bit of a mystery. That is about as historically accurate as all the white guys who work on your sugar plantations that you pay wages to. While the game is incredibly deep, it suffers from having ZERO in-game help or tutorials. It took me three full days of playing to realize I could have my warehouses auto-buy goods when they were cheap so that I didn't have to micro manage them. The same is possibly with your trade convoys but I haven't been able to fully figure it out yet. Finding an online guide is a must for full enjoyment. There are even deeper aspects of the game and economy, but it would take a book to get in to them all. If you are a lover of deep economic sims this game is 100% for you.  ",80,10,0,26,22,0,37

												I can't be the only person who's gotten a pirate ship or spaceship and spent all their time hauling junk around to sell. There's something quietly gratifying about buying low and selling high, and so there should be no surprise there are games that exist to scratch that itch. Port Royale 2 does just that on the surface, and then surprises you with several more layers of fortune-seeking options.You play an aspiring merchant in the Carribbean of the 1600s, starting with little more than a sloop and some sacks of money. Your ship will get you around to the many ports, each modeled in simple, charming Stronghold-esque 2D. The buildings that comprise each town determine what goods they produce from a list of about two dozen, and the rate at which they consume them. Your job, then, is to learn which towns need which goods, and where the best place to buy them up is.It's not as simple as finding a town that makes shirts and a town that grows cotton, though. Each location is constantly producing and consuming goods, and their prices are determined by dynamic supply and demand. So, if you bring a huge load of cotton to shirt town you might make a pile of money, but turn around and do it again and that cotton might be worthless because they haven't used up the first load yet. Success in the mercantile business means making circuits around the sea, picking up whatever you can at bargain-basement prices and unloading it at whatever port happens to need it. The world map helpfully displays what good a town needs the most at the time, but there are plenty of other trader that can beat you to the punch.The dynamic, living world of Port Royale is what keeps it fresh and entertaining, because not only will demand flip on you, you can be the agent of that change. Strike enough deals in a town and they'll grant you building permits to set up your own farms and workshops, allowing you to add new production sources across the map. With enough capital you can move away from buying and selling random goods and instead working your own supply chains for pure profit. You can have enormous merchant fleets at your disposal, moving around huge loads of goods or broken up across the Carribbean to beat the other traders to the punch.Somehow the developers didn't think that was enough, so if you want to eschew the merchant life for full privateering, even that's an option. Any ship can be designated a warship and outfitted with cannon and sailors to take on pirates or merchants of other nations, or even besiege and ransack ports. Governors in major towns will even give you missions to eliminate particularly troublesome captains if you need guidance. There's real-time combat between ships that's functional but basic compared to other high-seas simulators, and comes with the odd handicap of letting you command one ship at a time while your opponents have their full fleet.Still, the combat is an engaging and welcome addition atop the robust economic simulator, and it isn't even the only one. You can also choose to ferry around settlers and construction materials to help grow towns, gamble in the many taverns of the world, piece together treasure maps, and more. A series of four extensive tutorial scenarios will help you get a grip on the game, and then you have four challenge scenarios or the wide-open freeplay mode to enjoy. The chunky 2D graphics might not have aged very well but they certainly don't detract from the relaxed atmosphere, and the soundtrack is exactly what you'd want in a low-key trading sim. Anyone with even a passing interest in being a high-seas merchant is sure to find something to enjoy here.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Only get this game if: 1.) its on sale, and 2.) you are OK spending some time learning the cryptic UI. Once you get past the interface (it doesnt look bad [for its time], it's just that nothing makes sense) you'll find a pretty solid trading game with lots of different ways to grow your business. To help learn the UI, there are several different ""Let's Play: Port Royale 2"" type videos on youtube where you can pick some things up.All around, pretty good. It grows on you, and is something different for your Steam Library.			",48,13,0,6,9,0,10

												I enjoy this although to get your own town is long long winded and very tricky, making money is quite simple once you work out the prices and the naval combat was considered top dog in its time is very old and slow today but still quite good if not quite realistic in lacking things like front and aft gunnery.It does work in Win 7/8, all you have to do is set the compatibility in the program launcher to 98/Me and works spot on.The only downside is really attacking pirate lairs, the 10 towers can be incredibly boring and they are immensely overpowered if you are in anything less than a military frigate or ship of the line and can reduce your mighty vessel into sawdust quite swiftly, the other niggle is that in naval combat you get one ship to control but the opponent has up to 5 and as soon as you relinquish control of one for another, the first one runs away.

												Port Royale 2 is a 17th century Caribbean themed trading/piracy/military sim. It's the basic mix of buy low, sell high, build up some cities to further expand your trading horizons, build up your fleet, engage in some piracy or privateering. It's a great and easily accessible intro the genre.However while accessibility is a perk of the game, it's also its downfall. The game is shallow and the economic simulation is basic. For instance cities not receiving sufficient supplies will rarely shrink so you'll have a huge array of countries willing to buy whatever product you might have at max price. And the economy is also mostly static. There are some irrelevant short term events (famine for instance increases food consumption x2) but with effectively infinite money to be had everywhere you look you'll probably never even notice these events. The ship combat is enjoyable at first, but weak AI becomes a problem once you learn the system, though that's pretty par for course in this genre.However, in spite of the limited depth it's still an enjoyable game and also has an excellent interface. Things like auto-traders can be heavily configured in a very intuitive fashion. If you're new to the genre or just looking for a relaxing and stress free romp through the caribbean then this is a great buy. If you're more experienced in the genre or willing to tolerate a more steep learning curve (but experience a far richer and more dynamic game in return) then Patrician 3 might be more up your alley.

When economics come in you have to know what town needs what and what towns has what that town needs, when you find two towns close to each other that needs what the other has, you make a large profit. When battling comes in you have to make sure that you have traded enough stuff to buy armaments to fight pirates and enemy nations, so that you can capture or destroy enemy convoys to allow you to trade more, and make money. When production comes in, you can build production facilities that produce: tobacco, wood and various other commodities, so that you can sell them to towns that want said commodities. Gambling can be accomplished by going to an inn and betting how many points you can get in a card game, if you get as many points as you bet you earn as much as you bet, if you don't you lose as much as you bet. Buying ships allows you to carry more goods, and carry more firepower.

												PR2 cannot be reviewed without looking at its contemporaries, Patrician III and Sid Meier's Pirates. While Patrician III is heavy on the trade, and Sid's Pirates lays on the charm of graphics, it seems PR2 tries to find a middle ground. However, they dont do so well at this. But this isn't to say PR2 isn't a fun game. And with Steam Sale price of under $2, its worth it. Lucky me, because PR3 looks to have flopped on it face (metacritic scores). If you liked any of the previously mentioned games, then this one is worth (only) a few bucks. Fun, but i'd go for a dead man's chest and a bottle of rum... Arrr 75%			",21,4,0,8,33,0,25

For a Economist or strategic thinker this game provides some challenge and will have you constantly upgrading ships, planning out sales of goods, and hunting down loose pirates who threaten your trade lines!My only grief is once you get established and have a solid trade route down you can amass a great fleet and then there is nothing to challenge you any more.

												Port Royal 2 is one of the best economic trade games I know. Like Patrician is showing Hanza, that PR is showing Caribbeans. 1 was hard, even too hard and 3 is pretty good but they have make some mistakes making game lame sometimes. I mean trade routes in it. In 2 I spend plenty of time and I will have forever this part in my heart of gamer. It's perfect and the best of them all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												messed with it and got it to start in windows 8, but it wont get past title screen.  Please don't waste your time.EDITED: Tried for Windows 10. Barely playable, but the water glitches like mad.  Still a NO until it's fully functional on Windows 10.  Seeing as there are only 3 options for graphics: Water quality (H,M,L), Ship Details (H,M,L), and Town Details (H,M,L), I think it's safe to say that I've tried everything....

Wait for game to load6. Wait some more for game to load7. Look at title of game in inventory and notice it says ""running"" 8. Look all over my desktop, do not see game anywhere9. Alt, Ctl, Dlt, notice game running on list of things currerntly running10. Click End Task11. Reapet 5 more times, then unistal and file for refund. Game says it is running, yet the game is actually no where to be found running other than in Task Manager			",131,25,2,13,20,0,18

												Pirating is part of my Family History...so maybe there's something there...maybe 75 cents for a game was just too low NOT to buy. This is an attempt at making Sid Meier's Parate Gold into a more polished game...but even though the game runs better and has better graphics and sound..it really isn't that much better...The big difference is in the building of fortunes in port...Pirates had none of this and ended once you got too old to command and fight.... The reality of Wooden ""Tall"" ships and especially Pirating..was brutal and gruesome...In fact, for centuries, Captains based their ppunishments on a tome called ""Rocks and Shoals""...it is the parameter used by the US NAVY...up until the establishment of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The truth is, we have romanticized Piracy to the point that it has become modern Mythology..and favored by writers like Danielle Steele...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
