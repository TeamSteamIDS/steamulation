												At first, I wanted to be a kind, benevolent dictator, in charge of my island which of course would be perfectly green, a land of equality, equal pay, a high living standard, jobs for every Tropican, a high level of schooling and a good member of the United Nations.However, people kept complaining. At first, this was fine. Free Speech and all. But they were not working. Worse, they began to become rebels and attack the work of innocent, hard working Tropicans. ""Right,"" I thought, ""no more of that."" I built guard posts around the nation to protect my other civilians and the economy which kept everyone fed and housed. After a while, the strikes became too much. ""This right to protest is too inefficient"", I thought, ""and we just missed that freighter. We needed that boost to the economy."" In a moment of Thatcher, I had the newly raised guards gun down some of the strikers. The rest returned to work. The right to protest had been removed, but people were happier as everyone got richer.The environmentalists began to get angry. ""It's too messy, too much industry, etc."" I sighed. Look, did they like having money? Money to get houses? Electricity for movie theatres and hospitals? Wind Turbines simply don't do enough, we needed that gas Power Plant. We needed the jobs to keep the whole economy turning. I tried, I added gardens, I protected and grew new forests, but they continued to complain. So I stopped listening, and focused on the higher standard of living.The U.S. came to me, demanding that I give them money, give this, give that, or ""accidents can happen"". But Agent Sasha instead never threatened me, referred to me as comrade and my islanders as Brothers. The Russians understood why I had to silence dissedence, and so we joined the Russians. At least they appreciated their people. The Americans... they didn't like this. But we stopped caring. We built assault rifles and using the funds from that, we built a nuclear weapon. Does it work? No idea, but it looks scary and shows the Americans that we MAY be able to blow something up. They stayed away and all was relatively well.Now, schooling was fine, but a lot of Tropicans were starting to get funny ideas. They didn't understand that I was so strict because I was balancing the house of cards that was my economy. They had food, jobs, entertainment, a good house with fantastic conditions, they were safe from criminals and rebels and they could travel anywhere in the world (but mostly Russia, China and the MIddle East). If they had to not protest or speak against me, it was purely because I couldn't risk this going wrong. So I had to change a few things. I began to ask that schools make sure that children understood how fantastic our nation was, how corrupt the U.S. was, how our military kept us safe. A few people got a bit funny with that, but I needed to make sure this nation would continue after my death. I executed the rebels and burnt any book which said otherwise. People got iffy, but after a few years, they stopped caring. Good. Now we can continue in happiness.Finally, my economy began to crumble. People refused to work the poorer jobs, they sat back on welfare and complained. They refused to pay the rent for better houses and built hovels on the side of roads. They committed crimes despite having social welfare. I couldn't make them work.So, I built cheaper places for them to live, cheaper foods and easier work. But my towns were full, so I built them in another area. To support my now burdened economy, I had to import immigrants. Lots of them. A few people began to complain, but I shot them and they stopped. Now we have a high, middle, lower and underclass, which is executed often to save the economy.However, Tropico is now making more money than ever, we're supporting every country that needs us, our people are famous for their money (when they can afford to travel), people order is perfect, there is no crime, you can go as far as you're willing to work, and you're safe.You're welcome, my comrades.

												Remember Sim City? The game where you take an empty landscape, and slowly but surely transform the area, from a small town, to a gigantic Metropolis?Picture all of that but instead of a landscape, it's a Carribean Island. Instead of turning a small town into a Metropolis, you're turning a third world Banana Republic, into a competent, capable nation, able to compete with the bigger world powers during the Cold War.This is what Tropico is.Tropico 4 is the fourth installment, in a line of City Management/Political Play/Strategy games, that has existed since the very early 2000s. Aside from certain notable additions, the major gameplay, and most of the models and graphics, are recycled from Tropico 3. Which, while I kinda wish they did a revamp of models, I understand the sentament. The gameplay isn't broken, and the models are just visual representations of what they are. There are many additions to this game, some really add something to the game, others are pretty cool and add a bit, and some are just kinda meh. One of the major gameplay mechanics is Political juggling between Seven Factions (Capitalists, Communists, Religious, Evironmentalists, Militarists, Nationalists, and Loyalists) as well as the Unites States, and The Soviet Union. The seven factions are still around, but now there are three more foreign powers, Europe, China, and The Middle East. Unlike the Soviets and Americans, who will invade you if you're relations with one or the other get's too low, these three won't invade you, as much as remove bonuses you recieve during good relations. Somtimes during your reign on the island, you'll get noticed that something bad happened between one of the nations, and you'll have to pick a side. There are also representatives for the factions. They mostly add two things. First, a face and personality to represent the faction they represent. Second, to provide side objectives during your reign to earn respect if you've lost some. The side objectives go for the Nations too, mostly in the form of sending goods that nation likes, or donating some money to that nation to earn respect.There three more additions worth talking about, firstly, there is a story driven campaign, a first for the Tropico series. You are Presidente, being mentored by a Generalisimo Santana, in the ways of managing a nation, and growing it Economically, treating your citizens right, knowing when to ""kick the dog"", and overall just staying in power and not getting killed or kicked out of office.The second is Imports. Generally speaking, if your island is a giant rock and little vegitation for food, then you're screwed and have to make the most of it. Otherwise, you can import! Say your on an island with a free Weapons Factory to build! But oh no, there is no Iron on the island at all! No worries, just have a stable economy, and import the iron from one of the foreign powers. It'll arrive on the next ship, be proccesed in the factory, and you'll earn alot of money!Finally, there are the Disasters. In Tropico 3 you mostly had five ""negative"" events that could occur. A rebel attack, a coup from your own military, a hurricane, an uprising, and a faction disaster if a faction really hates you. Now there are Natural disasters to spice things up. Now you have to worry about events you can predict (via a Weather Station), but cannot control. Things like Volcanic Eruptions (if your island has a volcano), A Tornado (or several if you're really unlucky), a Tsunami, Oil Spill, fires, and droughts. Fires from volcanos and derelict buildings can be fixed by either paying for a helicopter to put it out, or by building a firestation. I personally like these disasters, because in Tropico 3 I was such a good presidente that I never had to worry about a coup or anything like that. Now, there is something I can worry about when my island is happy.So far I really like that the game is still easy to play in general (once you know what to do that is), and the additions are very nice. But I have some cons.Somtimes you'll get a notice about doing something and have to choose an option. You can't exit out to check your almanac to see what it could impact and how to fix it, you have to choose, and that sucks sometimes. Also some missions in the campaign are pretty tough on you. You have to make sure you've picked the right traits for President to make the island truley yours.I don't do reviews, so I won't use a number system, and instead list the pros and cons, and then a final statement as to wether you should really grab this or not.PROS:-Game Mechanics are the same, with additions like imports.-Disasters add suspense and more risk to buildings wrecked.-Story is fun and simple-Characters have well drawn charicature type portraits to represent them-Some new buildings to help out with the new additionsCons:-AI for the Tropicans are competent, but man do they job hop around, and they'll walk through Morder itself just to get some corn.-Sometimes a choice won't let you check statistics to really understand an impact.-Some missions in the campaign aren't easy.Should you buy this game? If you like Sim City, you'll love Tropico 4, if you like Sim City, but want it on a smaller scale, you'll love Tropico 4, if you want to try a ""modern"" Sim City game, but EA screwed it up, then You'll like Tropico 4.But if you don't like statistics, or the recycled models and gameplay, as well as the AI, I wouldn't reccommend it.It's $29.99 on Steam, but I'd also reccomend you grab Tropico 3 for it's cheaper price, and they're the same gameplay wise.

												Tropico 4 is a pretty standard city management sim, except it takes place on the islands of Tropico where you are free to be as dictatorial as you want. You may commit election fraud, kill protestors, create a secret police, and embezzle money into your swiss bank account. All that said, I was struck by how incredibly similar this game is to the previous one.If you own and have played Tropico 3 and you feel like you got about all you could out of that game, there is nothing for you here. If you are new to the series, this is as good a place as any to jump in. Unfortunately this game requires you to register for yet another 3rd party service you will probably rarely ever use unless you are a big Kalypso fan.Another aspect to mention is that the game is not very clear on how some of the buildings and functionalities work. For instance when you place certain buildings you can see the landscape is shaded. When placing a farm, the greener areas are areas where your crops will have an easier time growing, when placing a police station it shows you areas of high crime in red, etc. But for some buildings it is not clear what the colours are really indicating. For instance, should you try to place a garbage dump close to red areas, which are presumably pollution? I wouldn't think so, because they just concentrate into one spot... so why even show it? Instinctively I would place my garbage dumps away from city areas, and I'm unsure what the indication really does to help. Maybe that isn't the best example but there are others.Also construction slows down immensely once your town grows into even moderate size. I keep building more and more construction yards but it doesn't seem to help, and some buildings will simply never be built unless they are prioritised.Thankfully the game is incredibly forgiving so all the issues can largely be overlooked. If you ever are in need of funds foreign powers will simply give you aid, and you'll find in most cases this makes it impossible to 'lose' by running out of money (if it even is possible...).Overall it's worth a play if you're new to the series, but there isn't a big improvement over the last iteration.

Will appeal to any fan of The Sims/Sims City or even some of the Tycoon games as it has a similar build your own city & run it feel.

												One of the few games that I bought when It came out and payed full price for the dlcs as well. Its a fun city building game with humor. It is pleasant to look at and you can almost build your city the way you like. Being on tropical island is refreshing.You are basically a standard Latino dictator (parody of Castro) who has to build up his Island into a prosperous city amidst the Cold war. You can choose to make your government more communist oriented or capitalist. In doing so you get the support from one of the Super powers. Similarly, you get various benefits or disadvantages in your international relations depending on how you run your island.Farming, industry, tourism, education, transport are some of the many aspects of the economy you'll have to manage in order to keep your islanders fed and happy.This is only a single player game though. The only thing you can do is upload your city in sort of high scores fashion where other folks can check it out. But for some reason I had trouble doing so.If you can get it cheap (on sale) then you can easily enjoy it for couple of days at least. Even if you get Tropico 5 when it comes out, some of the content will stay unique as in Tropico 3 like the radio broadcaster/ commentator and music etc.			",1222,532,53,145,147,12,207

												I started an island and in 3 minutes, I was in debt. After that beard guy gave me a final loan, somehow I got my economy up and running.I dominated the market by having hundreds of tobacco and coffee farms everywhere.Then, the hippies were annoying me with their voices and pleas to stop the farms and logging productions.Being the great President I was, I paid $500 to assassinate their leader. $500 well spent.I promised to build better houses and hospitals if I got elected.But in order to build hospitals I had to build a power plant.Around this time, the religious leaders were annoying me with ""messages from god"" saying I had to build cathedrals and churches for god.I already had to spent 80% of my money build the cathedral and hiring priests.So I demolished every single church and cathedral in my island, built a prison and arrested every religious person on my island.Then the communists kept pestering me, I built another prison and arrested them.Finally, the hippies were back. I was doomed.So I arrested all of them and destroyed every single tree on the island with logging farms.After this, I was awarded a win for being so awesome.But no.Since the game is over, I decided to throw my island into utter chaos.But it was so ♥♥♥♥ing hard.I printed money, did nuclear tests, demolished everything. Made wages super low.Somehow, there were only 7 rebels.I tried to do everything in my power to make the entire island rebel against me.But they didnt.I finally concluded I was such a good President, the people would follow me even if I killed all of them.And I left the game.10/10 liek if u cri everytiem			",72,5,0,11,8,0,7

												Now about this game. You start on an Island with the following.- 1 palace to guard your president- 1 teamster office to distribute the goods- 1 construction office to build your buildings- 1 dock to ship your goods and to bring you immigrants- a certain amount of money- random buildings given as bonus. In this game your goal will be the following- to survive economically- to keep the satisfaction level of your peasants at an acceptable level- to fend of any rebels coups and uprisings against your dictatorship in a non controlable fight- to keep the diplomatic relationships with the us and the soviet union at a level where they wont invade your island.- to accomplish the main tasks given by the scenarioI played this game for 200 hours now. And i can say it is a nice game. What is nice about it? I like leveling the stats of my el presidente character. Like to do the game achievements. There are some that i have not finished yet even after 200 hours. And that is because sometimes it is not easy. I played the campain several times. Got 3 stars in every scenario.  With extra missions and Modern times. I think the nicest thing about this game is the fact that everything has a solution. Unlike its predecessor Tropico 3 where you were stuck with high pollution from factories you now have garbage dumps and water treatment plants in Modern times. You have alternative energy sources. You can import goods and smuggle goods. Your island no longer defines what you can do on it but rather your imagination limits the way you play. I will purchase Tropico 5 once i have finished everything in this game and Tropico sells for a 75% or 80% discount.			",54,6,1,17,4,0,5

												Tropico 4 is city building simulation game published by Kalypso Media Digital. It is a sequel to the previous game Tropico 3.Tropico 4 is one of my favorite city building game, it's so fun and feature rich. It's more like island nation simulation game. You can build many things, do many things... in fact many things can happen here. Greatest simulation game I ever play.Gameplay of Tropico 4 is very rich, and they're so great! Start as a small town in an island on the Caribbean, we begin developing by building new living places such as houses, creating infrastructure and public services such as roads, church, hospital and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Everything needs to be addressed here, the happiness of the people, the economy and industry, even diplomacy with other nation and the two world great superpowers, The USA and the USSR. Failed to address even one of these and bad things will happen, like rebellion, or military coup, or worse an invasion! But managing those problem are not easy too.♥♥♥♥♥♥happens mate. Volcano could erupt and explodes, tornadoes may attack or even tsunami can invade! But hey! You are the El Presidente right? Anything is possible.Tropico 4 Graphics are quite decent, while it's not as pretty as SimCity, it's not bad. Still has its own beauty. Performances are great, but some small bug still present in this game, not a big deal though, just some graphical bug with those fisherman.Tropico 4 are one of best city building simulation out there, with some small humor build into it. I recommend this! Become El Presidente today!Rating 9/10			",1158,351,58,143,167,12,228

												    Review linked to August 2016 anniversary sale.    245 hours played.  Wow.    For those that have never played the game before.  Tropico 4 is an island management strategy game set in a Carribean island.  Effectively you build buildings to provide your Tropicans with homes, jobs, religion, medical treatment, food, entertainment.  You have very little to no direct control over the people themselves so you must achieve your aims by building or passing edicts - Presidential orders.   For those that have played Tropico before - there aren't massive changes.  This version has no Juanita on the radio from Tropico 3 who was always helpful in pointing out where your society had problems.  She is replaced by (unvoiced) faction leaders (who are different from the ones you can actually see, bribe and kill on your island).  Overall the game is significantly easier than Tropico 3 - no more having to repeat the same mission over and over.  The economy is generally more forgiving, particularly in the Modern Times expansion which provides some exceptionally helpful new buildings.  However intitial development is slower.  Many edicts require a government minister which requires a ministry and a Tropican with the required skills.  Generally choose the best available.  Competent ministers can bring you valuable bonuses.  Incompetent ones must be sacked to avoid disaster.  The campaign is linear.  Russia and the USA are joined by The Middle East, Europe, and China as world powers.  Another big development is natural disasters.  One of the great horrors of the game is watching four huge tornadoes descend on your island and spend a game year smashing up your carefully built island.  Helpfully Tropico 4 allows you to ""rebuild"" rubble so you aren't left guessing what each pile of busted masonry was before it got destroyed.    Approaches differ.  I always tended to try and maximise happiness on the islands with free and fair(ish) elections and no-one being killed except active rebels.  Even then I'd always try and bring rebels back from the jungle with an amnesty rather than risk the lives of my gallant soldiers with battles.  Others I have heard play as intolerant dictators.    This is actually a great game.  It requires a fair degree of patience although there is a speed up option but there is a gentle pleasure about watching your islanders go about their daily business with a soundtrack of funky Latin music (in fact EXACTLY the same funky Latin soundtrack they have had since the original Tropico).  This edition has virtually all the added missions and costumes that otherwise they'd nickel and dime you for.    Effectively this involves you playing the same game thirty or more times on different islands with different resources, different problems, and different victory conditions.  But it's a great game and the different rules for each scenario do force you to modify your favourite strategies.    Overall of all the Tropicos up to and including 4 this is the one I'd rate as the most fun.  People have talked about Tropico being a challenger for Sim City in the city builder stakes but that's not true.  In terms of fun, personality, and playability Tropico is clearly better.     Buy this game.  You'll never have so much fun demolishing poor people's shacks, either torturing prisoners or exploiting them on work farms, murdering enemy spies, putting down rebellions, and bribing strikers.  And I play nice.S.x. ",153,17,3,25,15,3,28

												""Presidente, an enemy tornado penetrated our defenses!""After the disaster, you read this: Tropican Morale: INTACTYou will find this kind of fun in this game. Tropico 4 is the perfect game for the ""would-be-generalissimo"", where you can always try [and make some mistakes, while] to command your own ""banana republic"". Have you ever wondered ""what if"" all people got the same [low] wages, all to expend at that decrepit pub on the corner? So this is your game.In a comparison to Tropico 3, it's the same experience after all. Some areas were improved, it's more stable on newer computers, and we have some slight changes to game mechanics. The expansion ""Modern Times"" add a high-tech [for Tropican Standards] taste and more funny jokes to the main game. It's a must buy if you liked the original. Despites the derivative sense that a player of Tropico 3 can get about Tropico 4, new challenges, choices and jokes [they are plenty and really funny if you catch the real-world references] await the veteran. For a city-buliding game, it really delivers the experience of commanding the life of each inhabitant. It's a different and welcome approach in front of games with a broad scope like SimCity and CitiesXL.The economic sphere is simple and it's possible to make a nice profit if one follow an economic chain, from tobacco crops to cigar factories, for example. In the welfare case, Tropicans are eager than most to accept dubious services, and have an inexplicable urge to visit churches and cathedrals [don't miss the joke on the Cathedral!]If you want a middle-range priced game that will deliver some dozens of hours at a tropical utopic/dystopic paradise, this is, I wonder, the sole competitor in genre. Players of Tropico 3 will get less of it, but it is worth the price. Newcomers will easily find themselves immersed on this atmosphere.

												In short: The only good parts of Tropico 4 is what hasn't changed from Tropico 3. This makes it a good game, but disappointing. I would not recommend this unless Tropico 3: Ultimate Power somehow cost more money than this, which I'd have a hard time believing is going to happen.This strikes me as a creatively bankrupt sequel, most noticable in how they have adjusted the shaders and bloom to make all the content look different, but 99% of it is the same content as in Tropico 3 Ultimate Power and it now just looks uglier.Speaking of DLC, there is a lot of it for this time, but none of it seems to offer any improvement to the game. The game as it was in Tropico 3 was already fairly complete in terms of options for its setting, and I would attribute the choice of what DLC to create more on marketing decisions and not creative, design decisions that would actually make the game any better. I have a hard time figuring out why else there is no worthwhile DLC.One irritating new feature are the advisors. They don't appear to actually have any effect on the running of your empire, their only function is that they unlock the usage of policies. Tropico 3 did not have this requirement, and there aren't any new, valuable policies that would necessitate an increase in start-up cost. All in all this 'feature' is a downside-- it's one more hoop that you must jump through on every single session. If your choice of advisors meant something, this would be one more wrinkle to make every island unique, but as implemented it just makes each island take longer.Voicework has been redone entirely for this edition of the game, but the lines are all the same. The difference is now the accents and mannerisms are much more muted, much more subtle. Improvement? I guess if you took the voicework in Tropico 3 very seriously and felt it was insensitively broad, then this would be an improvement. Personally I really missed the energetic, light-hearted and boisterous character-line delivery, and the words haven't even changed so if they wanted to be more politically correct this is a half-measure at best; a compromise that pleases no one.If you've tapped out Tropico 3 and its expansions and just want more missions, then by all means, get this game. If you're wondering which Tropico to get, or want the most value for the dollar, get Tropico 3 + its expansion.			",163,61,1,43,44,2,60

												Overall rating: 9/10By far my favourite city-building sim of all time.I actually bought this game because I had heard a ♥♥♥♥-tonne of♥♥♥♥♥♥about how awful the new Simcity was, and I was really craving a Simcity-like game. After playing Tropico, I don't think I could go back to playing Simcity ever again. Tropico is more or less what Simcity would be if it had a nonsensical, but fantastically humorous storyline. You play as El Presidente, ruler of some island, and the game takes you through a bunch of different and ridiculous scenarios. Describing them would spoil the fun of you finding them out on their own. In the meantime, you have to keep everyone happy - be it the religious group, the nationalists or the environmentalists, which often requires a delicate balance in where you spend your hard-earned dollars.As for the gameplay, the learning curve is just about where you want it to be. You have a lot of leeway in the earlier missions and the objectives are relatively straightforward, whilst the later objectives can be a little frustrating and even unfair. There was one mission in particular where after playing for hours and completing the initial objectives, I was told that the next objective had to be completed by a certain date - this date had already passed, and I instantly failed the objective. I was... miserable, to say the least.Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on who you are), once you get the hang of the game and know what you're doing, things become a little bit too easy. Without trying to spoil anything, I'll just say that some forms of income are much easier to obtain than other forms, which creates somewhat of a conundrum - you WANT to diversify your city because it's more fun that way, but it requires more work for it to be successful. The graphics are pretty standard for a modern game, although the Caribbean-inspired music was stuck in my head for quite some time. Overall, I'd most definitely recommend this game for anyone that likes city-building simulation games (be it Sim City, Rollercoaster Tycoon, Theme Park, etc).  ",1146,480,42,159,145,13,200

												You are El Presidente, a dictator that has his, or hers, own topical nation island. The game has a lot of charm and humor, which you can see all over the place. Gameplay is not made for large scale sandbox playing, instead it's heavily oriented towards the campaign missions, but don't worry, here, it has you covered. The ""Modern Times"" expansion brings a lot to the table, like new buildings and a new campaign. The campaigns follow a story and you get to do all sorts of crazy stuff including getting (Twitter?) followers and managing a hiccup outbreak. Every person on the island is tracked individually, you can click on them and see all sorts of data and their thoughts. Here you can also issue arrest warrants, bribes, brand them as heretics, eliminate or arrange ""accidents"".   Unfortunately not everything is happy and sunny, there is a lack of micro-management that I believe is necessary. For instance I had a pretty big problem when instead of exporting what I considered excess food, my subjects decided to first hoard a lot of the food at the market instead of a more balanced approach. ""Modern Times"" times comes with a lot of newer versions for a lot of buildings, unfortunately you're stuck with a pretty inefficient system for the transport of goods, which becomes a bigger and bigger bottleneck as your city develops.Pros: charm and humor.Cons: doesn't scale well for larger cities, lack of some management options.Rating: Have no fear, El Presidente is here!http://pixelloot.com ",71,18,0,5,10,0,30

												If you haven't played the series yet, and you have any interest in the city-building type of game, it's definitely worth a look.  Compared to a game like SimCity, Tropico is more mission-focused.  Islands have specific resources to exploit or ignore, and the infrastructure required for some industries means it's easier to focus entirely on one or two industries than it is to spread your resources around.  Tourism islands rely upon good press and expensive attractions bleeding visitor wallets dry, while farming or mining and industry can make for a relatively more stable economy (if one subject to the whims of international prices) but also require far more effort put into educating and housing the populace.  Also unlike SimCity, unhappiness is a much greater direct threat to your Presidential persona.  Especially early on, you'll be short on food, housing, healthcare, churches, and schools, and extremely short on resources to fulfil those needs.  In the interim, you've got a rebellion fomenting if you don't jury-rig a working city on the double.  Inversely, like with many of these types of games (like the older Pharaoh or Caeser games) once your miniature city starts working at all, you're in the clear, and there are rarely any real threats.  (Although now natural disasters can strike, as well as things like superpower conflicts, which make for late-game threats that Tropico 3 didn't have.) You can play any level past completion of the objective, so you can just keep going until you have an island completely packed to the brim with bustling economic activity, and have money coming out the ears, if you so choose.Tropico 3 is an important comparison to make because... there aren't really that many changes from Tropico 3.  Tropico 3 is cheaper, has the *EXACT SAME ENGINE, GRAPHICS, AND VOICES* and most of the mechanics are unchanged.  You might consider getting 3 first.  The differences are in disasters and mini-quests that pop up mid-mission, which DO keep the game feeling a little fresh, but if you're not certain on the series, but Tropico 3 on sale to test-drive the series.  Tropico 5 is out now, but unless you know you want it, it's probably worth waiting for all the changes that will likely be made to the base game to be made, and play 4 instead until 6 comes out, and 5 is finalized.

 Tropico 4 : Super full of DLC you don't notice edition Let me tell you a story.Once upon a time, a guy came on an island and said ""This is my land."" This man was El Presidente.El Presidente started to lead its people and built a city for them. El Presidente was a proud man, so he built a museum to describe his young times, and Loyalists were happy.Ecologists started bullying his statues, so he sent his militaries to get them away and people were happy.Communists wanted more houses for the people, so Presidente built 20 houses.Nationalists wanted less crime, so Presidente built 20 police stations.Penultimo lost half the Presidente's investments at the bar, so Presidente destroyed 20 houses and 20 police stations to save money.People were not happy anymore, because Presidente doesn't give a fùck, because Presidente is Presidente.People started riot all around the town, but Presidente does not give shïts and sent tanks to roll on people, and Presidente was happy !10/10, would be Presidente again.

												To be perfectly honest, Tropico 4 isn't a bad game at all, but it's almost exactly identical to Tripoco 3 with the interface changed to be much worse. It's been around the time when relasing a tidalwave of tiny small DLCs became a practice, and the developers clearly made Tropico 4 only to jump on the milk train. Content is 99% identical, graphics 99% identical, new UI that's uncomfortable to use after Tropico 3 because it covers the whole screen instead of being the compact nice little interface we were used to... and even Huanito is gone, who made all the radio streaming forever fun and interesting. If you have Tropico 3, just skip Tropico 4. If you don't have either, you can get this, but I'd recommend Tropico 3 over it.			",265,23,10,15,10,3,39

												The game is great. Very enjoyable and with an OK replay value.However, Kalypso sucks as a publisher. Not only they force you to make a stupid third-party account, they release several DLC which could be packed with the original game (or a single expasion, just like they did with Tropico 3). This really frustrates me as a gamer consumer, therefore, I'm giving this negative review. The same warning goes to Tropico 5: wait untill a ""Gold Edition"" or something like that comes out to buy; otherwise, you'll have to pay for the new DLC's over and over again.

												My country has an ageing population issue. My economy is contracting. My people are infected with lupus...or so they say. What should I do?One day, a man goes by the name of Dinko Rizzo chose to become a criminal at the age of 70. Seeing that the good citizens of my country were being robbed, I had him arrested and thrown into a labour camp. It was there he worked as a farmer, like his father and his father's father, for the rest of his days. He finally met his maker at the age of 82.The crops he had grown had given me roughly $10k of income, good enough to offset his social security costs over the years. Seeing that this has made contributions to the ecnomy, it gave me an idea -- why not I arrest all of my retirees and put them in labour camps? As such, I ordered my builders to construct 4 more labour camps and issued arrest warrants to all of my retirees. It was then my economy started expanding, like what it used to be. My people began to trust my decisions more and hailed me as their great leader. Little did they know it all started with a man who thought that retiring was too mainstream.Thank you Dinko Rizzo! You will always be remembered as a hero.			",110,11,3,7,22,1,34

												After fully exploiting the fun from city-builders like Cities:Skylines, Anno2070 and Banished, Tropico 4 hiding in my library for years has caught my attention. I must say this is a brilliant game, a gem in the genre. The graphic is not as good as Anno series, but the writing definitely outshines other competitors as it got me laughing all the time. The mechanism of the game is simple to learn but hard to master. The only thing that bothers me is that the background music is constanly hyped that it gets annoying sometimes. Overall it's a great game and It has sucked me into it. If you are a city-builder fan, you don't want to miss this.			",150,65,4,23,32,1,35

												Fun and interesting game.  I would recommend it, but I feel the company is doing their absolute best to milk money out of their customer base by releasing small DLC at reasonably high prices for what you are receiving.  It's a shame, but then again so many people think capitalism is the greatest thing since the shaved clam.  Keep In mind capitalism is great for a new and burgeoning country in which the people need to have an opportunity to thrive and start up their own business.  The problem people fail to realize is government red tape wasn't the brain child of the U.S. Government, but the genius idea of well-established companies who being loyal and devoted to their shareholders were able to purchase up competition and create red tape through political pressure through lobbyists.  It was by design the rich are the smallest group among all societies, but it is a shame that a person can't work 40 to 50 hours a work week and support his wife and two kids.  The way it was back in the 40's, it should be again today.  I'm rambling so I'll just shut up.  Sorry.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-Have you ever listened to the news, or reading a newspaper and you hear about those dictators who care little of their citizens, exploit their own homelands, or even assassinate political enemies?Guess what! there's a game where you can do just that! No, not Roller Coaster Tycoon *Flash back to all the guests I drowned in my childhood* Tropico 4, is a simulation game, much like Rollercoaster Tycoon, where you attempt to accomplish various goals and earn money to get a higher score.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You are ""Presidenti"", a fictional character who can be pretty much whoever you want him to be. Personally I can't shake the name ""fidel castro"" From my mind. Anyway, I digress; You're whole goal is to shape the Island of ""Tropico"" into a paradise/world-power/luxury-resort/tourist-attraction.There are a number of missions or quests that you complete as you progress through the game, you start out with a tutorial where you're being taught about ""rule and politics"" by ""generalissimo"". (aka, the tutorial)Game Play: There's several different modes, but generally it comes down to two ways to play: Missions, and Sandbox mode. On missions you have various objectives that you must succeed in to unlock the next mission.The controls in the game feel like Rollercoster tycoon had woohoo with the Sims3, I've always disliked moving around the world with the cursor or the arrow keys, because whenever I press ASDW I bring up some rogue menu. However it's not too difficult to overcome the movement keys and zooming methods (mouse wheel).Fair warning: There's a lot to take in when you start this game. Most people who have played Simulator games should already be aware of this quality, you micromanage a whole Island and have different objects that show up that you can choose to complete or not. Achievements: My achievements wouldn't appear until I leave the game and re-enter, most the achievements require really getting into the game and accomplishing various tasks, you would do well to just play through the campaign and worry about what achievements are left once you're finished.Price: Tropico is priced at $19.99, which is a fair price for how much content is in the game, as always; I suggest waiting for a sale so you can get the most out of your money.Conclusion: One last thing to keep in mind about Tropico 4, it was released in 2011. Meaning the graphics look dated, since the graphics tried to go for ""realism"" it's quite obvious the game was designed in 2011. Here's the real question: Do I like the game? Yes, and no. The game is fun, but I need to spend more time learning the mechanics. It's a sound working game, so there's that. But I didn't particularly enjoy this game more then other strategy games I've played.In the end I don't feel one way or another about this game, there is a PC Demo, if you're considering getting this game I recommend trying that Demo to know for sure if you want it.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update February 25, 2015: Formatting correction.

												For a game with revolution constantly under the surface, or on its sleeve, Tropico 4 takes a pretty conservative stance to pushing the series forward. Filled with incremental improvements that make it easier and more engaging than ever to fill the role of dictator of a Caribbean island, Tropico 4 never quite takes the steps to fully distinguish itself from the third entry in the series.For those new to the series, Tropico is a city-builder, where the player needs to balance the needs of citizens in a third world island nation with economic growth through industry and tourism, as well as building up your military for the time when the public gets restless and revolution starts to spread across your island. Along the way, you have to pander to local political factions, try to please the USSR and US to stave off invasions and secure aid, and, in a new addition to Tropico 4, try to work with lesser powers as well, dealing with the EU, China and the Middle East.This complicated balancing act is aided by a new addition to the game's information screen, which shows what each faction and nation expects of you, and what you're doing to displease them, removing the guessing game of previous installments of Tropico and giving you access to a quick and easy to-do list. In a game with so many factors to balance, changing the focus from guessing what will please others, and making it a matter of balancing your priorities.Additionally, faction leaders at home and abroad will always be sure to let you know what they want. While many of these missions are natural extensions of your goals, and were probably things you were planning to do anyways, the times when environmentalists demand you build a wind turbine on an island that has no power draw, when the US requests you start producing and exporting oil on an island with no oil deposits, or when lesser powers ask for a loan from a third world country with a GDP of twenty thousand a year, add a bit of a Kafkaesque vibe to the game's events. Fortunately, aside from a lack of favor and bonuses, there's no real downside to ignoring the more insane requests that come your way.Past the informational upgrades that Tropico 4 provides, there are a fair number of new additions that refine the game, even if they don't revolutionize it. Nearly two dozen buildings give you new options to please tourists and keep your people in line, and new edicts help flesh out your options. On the other hand, the edit system's newest upgrade, requiring a ministry and ministers to enact policy changes, feels a bit like wasted potential. While you appoint islanders, or appoint foreigners, to high government positions, once there, they simply act as edict dispensers. It seems like the game missed a major opportunity for scheming, bootlicking, and potential governmental strife that would have fit in perfectly with the theme of running a tiny Caribbean nation.Making your dictator is as fun as ever. Setting up El Presidente's background, rise to power, and traits customizes the way you play fairly well, running from a tourist president to a military dictator, to a sweat-shop operator. In fact, the last is better supported than ever before, with the ability to import raw materials to manufacture into finished goods and ship to America. This new addition to Tropico's economic system is one of the most notable changes, even if it's not a very dramatic one.When it comes time to play the game, unfortunately, the sandbox mode is where it's at. That's not a bad thing by any means, mind you, since it's a hell of a sandbox, and trying to perform the balancing act that the game demands will keep you busy for a while. The downside is that the game's campaign is fairly lackluster. As a huge fan of campaign modes in strategy games, I was pretty deeply disappointed that Tropico 4's ended up being a rather long tutorial, followed by a number of repeating mission objectives and drawn-out scenarios waiting for counters to hit arbitrarily high numbers. The campaign will certainly teach you how to play the game, but with the enhanced data screens and missions provided to you ingame, it would be pretty safe to skip it and get to the meat of the matter.All told, Tropico 4 is a good game. While it might not have revolutionized the series, it does a good job of fleshing out some of the options that Tropico 3 lacked. For people interested in city-building games who're new to the series, it'll make an excellent starting point, with more intuitive decision-making than ever before. For series veterans, it'll seem more like a standalone expansion than a full sequel, and it might be good to wait for a Steam sale to bring its price down to match. Either way, it's a game that's well worth having.			",2267,868,87,236,310,22,349

												Tropico 4 is yet another sequel to Tropico, still being about dictatorship, and a direct sequel of Tropico 3, being almost like expansion pack. Yep, it's like a building sim, but more centered around small populations of Banana republic, so to say. It was released in 2011 by Haemimont and Kalypso, being on PC and Xbox 360. Steam apparently got this version where they added one more sandbox map and some player costumes. In other words, this is probably the best version.Not much to say technical wide, but the engine was updated and seems to be even more optimized now. I didn't expect it to work better than Tropico 3, so that's great!Albeit they implented Steam achievements in silly way. It only checks when you startup the game. That means that if you want in-game achievements to be noticed by Steam then you have to restart the game after your session of play.And well, what can I say. Tropico 4 without any add-ons feels like a mere expansion pack to Tropico 3: Absolute Power. Sure thing, it came out 2 years after the third one. I am not even sure what to write about.Well, there is now a new campaign which seem to be fun and with humorous characters. Now with proper main story lines. Still given only through text with potraits.It was still a bit of a drag, so with it being so similar to Tropico 3 I didn't feel like beating it.There are a few new buildings, like firehouse. Or salt mine, which promises infinite recources.It still is easy to keep yourself in power and to have money rain on you from indursty. Actually, you can now import recources, making it possible to run pure industry busyness. And if you are tired of waiting for construction workers wasting time with fiesta, then you can now Quick Build construction with money. Which is great, but seeing how money rains on you, it kinda removes a bit more challenge.Disaster are now better implented. You can now actually watch hurricane wrecking up your plans in real time.It's nice to be given side-quests by both campaign and by factions.And now I think I already ran out of any big things to mention.As for those who never played, this game is about building your island nation, by placing buildings, issuing kinda-dictatorship edicts and keeping all political factions happy. Also, unlike first game, it's very easy to keep in power and keep factions happy, so 3 and 4 are very laid back games. Actually, it's easier to be democratic and honest, then try to be dictator, so forget about this part. Sadly. Still will steal hours of your time.It's still is a bit more than Tropico 3 with Absolute Power, so newcomers should buy this one. Just watch it, there is one expansion pack and dozens of lazy tiny DLCes.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												I completed this game just now and I have to say that I am very satisfied. I don't really play a lot of city builders, but this one was a lot easier to get into compared to other major titles within the genre. Tropico 4 has a lot of good points such as..- Expansive wiki & informative community (steam guides, forum guides, articles/tutorials)- Beautiful Graphics that really convert the game into an immersive experience- Colorful cast of characters and their representative factions- Fun custom challenges and expansive DLCThese are only a few things about Tropico 4 that make it a solid city builder. Unfortunately, I have yet to log over 100 hours on this game so any further points would be best commented on by more experienced players.My only complaint after completing the game 100% is that some of the objective descriptions are pretty vague. I encountered 2 such missions which I had trouble fully understanding mainly due to the lack of objectivity in the text. If you google 'canned goods index tropico 4' then you'll be able to see what I mean.Anyway, aside from that small thorn on my side, I genuinly had fun with the game. There were a lot of ways to win and even more ways to lose terribly but all of them simply add to the flavor of the game.I've already gotten Tropico 5 just because of how much I enjoyed this game!

El Presidente in all its glory!Game developers can be criticised for a small number of changes compared to the previous one, nonetheless Tropico 4 appears to be very solid, polished, smart and funny. Graphics is slightly ailing and from the speakers flows still the same (but greatly blending into the atmosphere) music. There is also lack of useful scales (or lists, whatever you wanna call it) like the number of individual buildings, as well as the information how many months left before exporting another batch of goods produced in the factory. Am I picky? Perhaps, but such minor mishaps can be noticed more. However, it pulls like a black hole, entertains like a good cabaret and lasts for a long time.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												Only because of it's recent lower price can I recommend this game. The price was far too high for a long time and Kalypso media need to cut it out.Tropico 4 is an interesting city builder that really shines in its early stages, much like all city builders. It's character and these processes make the game worth it in itself. Unfortunately, it suffers from a typical, rapid decline in things to do in the later game. You simply become too big, too well structured to fail. This is an issue that city builders should strive to overcome. ",25,0,0,3,4,0,4

												Welcome back to Tropico my friends! Not much has changed since Tropico 3. There are new menus, new caricatures, new voice overs that lay on thick personality and accents. The graphics look the same and feel as if they're directly from Tropico 3. The are new disasters like tornadoes, tsunamis, droughts, and volcanoes. To compliment the disasters there are fire stations to put out the fires and a new weather station. To unlock edicts that help or opress your people, you'll not only need a ministry new to the series, but hire people to run each branch. You'll get to chose from viable candidates, or for a price you can import an expert. Buildings can now import resources. If you have a rum factory, but no sugar farms, you can simply import the sugar. There are also more foreign powers such as China, the UK and the Middle East. They won't donate money like the USA and USSR, but they'll give you goals to accomplish. There are new optional goals that you get by clicking the icons over buildings. New to the series is a quick build that will instantly construct a building for a price.Tropico 4 is a surprisingly good city builder or rather a 3rd world simulator. It is very different than games like Sim City and Cities XL. Those two games are more macro city builders, where in two or three mouse clicks you can make city blocks where 1,000 people might live. With Tropico 4 and the Tropico series in general, you need to place each building, each road and your island along with the time it takes your construction company to build it. Your entire island might get to be 200 - 500 'Tropicans.'Each Tropican has needs... Food, religion, job, healthcare, entertainment, safety and so on. The catch is every Tropican's needs have a certain weight to them based on what faction they believe in. Each faction has major and minor demands. The military will want more soldiers, so you need to build an army base. The religious faction will want a church or cathedral. The capitalist party will want privatization or upscale entertainment. The communist party will want you to enable the free public housing edict or have etiquette healthcare.On top of that, you balance political relations with the USA and USSR. If they get too bad, one of the two will basically take over your country and it will be game over. It is interesting how many ways that you can get game over. The most common way to get a game over is to lose an election. You don't have to have elections even. You're in charge. If you don't want an election, the nationalist party will hate you and your loyalist party will love you. If you opt to have elections, it will be vise versca. People will call for early elections and when you have elections, you can see preliminary results and you can even sway (cheat) elections. Its all at the risk of a party's love.It is pretty cool having to pick 3 things to make a speech about and then fulfill campaign promises, but its all pretty easy. Winning elections is pretty easy, especially compared to how difficult it was to win any elections in the original Tropico. It was so bad in that game, that it was almost impossible to win an election without stuffing the ballot box.When citizens hate you, and there will be plenty that do, they will either peacefully protest or become rebels. Once you have enough rebels against you, they will attack your most remote buildings. Your army will then go fight them, but if the rebels outnumber your army, the rebel will win and the buildings will be destroyed. The rebels can attack your palace or flat out assassinate you for a game over.Tropico has a single player campaign with 20 scenarios that each take an hour or two to complete. You don't just pick scenarios, you unlock them. Each scenario seems to have scenario specific events that only occur in the scenarios. Unlike Tropico 3, I don't get a sense in the scenarios of an ultimate goal I'm striving toward. I feel like I stumble into victory when its least expected. At the start of each scenario you can pick a player character from historical tropican dictators or make your own avatar. You can even make personality traits that will result in pros and cons. It can drastically change your play style if you are incorruptible and never have any crime or have a green thumb and have high farm yields at the cost of low factory production.Your businesses, mines, farms, and everything requires citizens in them to function and make you money. Every citizen has different education levels that will impact who does what. So you need to build high schools and colleges. Once built, there are options to gear students to military or religion. You can also click vacant positions to hire foreign experts for a price. If you have more businesses than citizens, build an immigration office and let anyone into the country or change it to only let in skilled workers so you keep bums out of your country.Nothing is done automatically. You place a building, then wait for your teamsters and construction crews to build it. The more crews and personnel you have working, the faster it'll get done. I'm happy with that. Its part of the realism. If there's a building you want developed faster, you can increase or decrease its priority. If its still taking too long, just have your avatar stand next to the building to get it done faster. The fire station works the same way.The graphics are beautiful and you'll see every Tropican walking around, hopping in their car and driving to locations. The music is nice and very Tropican / Salsa music, but there's very little variety from Tropico 3. A few hours in I was bored with the music. The DJs feel gone for the most part. They're still in the game, but they do interviews with one liners here and there. The voice acting consists of great parodies of stereotypes. They really had fun embellishing on characters with tongue in cheek humor. The game knows you're all powerful and while being a dictator is usually seen as a horrifyingly negative thing, the humor twists it into a silly positive thing.If you have Tropico 3, play Tropico 3. Tropico 4 is still a great game, but has a ton of DLC and feels like a cash grab with only minor upgrades. The menu feels more cumbersome and click heavy than Tropico 3. The disasters take way too long and it breaks the flow the game has. The quick build feature feels like a good addition that you don't have to use, but sometimes it takes forever for the construction crews to build, even with several construction offices at full capacity.

												Tropico 4, for no apparant gameplay reason, requires you to register a Kalypso media account before you can play the game. I did so, despite my objections, but never recieved an activation email. Every time I try to login, it asks me to confirm my account using the activation email, and every time I hit the ""resend"" button nothing appears in my inbox. So, I give up. The game itself could be terrific, but I'll never know because I don't have the patience to wrangle with a broken authentication system.			",391,83,7,52,49,5,84

To be fair, it is very similar to ""Tropico 3"", but this isn't really a bad thing. I feel like whenever Tropico does something more unique (""Tropico 2"", ""Tropico 5""), it's losing its charm.

												Tropico 4 is a fun way to casually waste away tens or even hundreds of hours, at minimum.It's not a hard game, at least for someone used to the strategy genre - and in fact there is no difficulty setting either. The missions are almost impossible to lose. Instead it just takes more time to win if you're less efficient.If you haven't played the previous installments, there is well plenty enough to explore and keep you busy for quite a while. If you're already familiar with the franchise (I wasn't), then I hear that this installment does not differ very much from Tropico 3 and you might want to treat it, price-wise, more like DLC.Let me stress that this game is funny. It is riddled with top-notch humour throughout, and the mostly stellar voice acting does justice to the character-specific jokes. I'd even go far enough to call this a good introductory game to the city-building strategy genre: you can easily take your time at every turn, and even if you find the mechanics hard to get around to, the constant jokes should provide a good incentive to stick around.

Product received for free
												Note that i got Tropico 4 for free from humble bundle. Just mentioning it cause i didnt payed for the game and that might (without me realising) affect the review.So Tropico.Tropico as a idea for a City-Building game is beyond great. Its really fun to manage your small nation and see how you interact with the superpowers of the world during the Cold War.I can pretty much say the same about the gameplay too. Its fun, engaging and really really interesting.However, what i personaly feel drags the game down is its replayablility. Now, take this with a pinch of salt. I've seen other people having like 100 and more in this game, but what i ultimately felt about this game is that after the 15 hour mark, the game started feeling really stale. I had experienced almost everything the game had to offer. I have builted everything i could built, i've won the game on medium and the only reason i could go back to the game is to sort off pass my highscore or to do some achievemenets that yet again were to reach some extended statistic which utimately led it to feel more of a chore.However, the reason my review is positive is because this 15 hours i spent playing the game beyond amazing.From the awesome and really fitting into the theme music to the witty and comedic requests from all the different political factions of the island, it was easily one of the best experience i ever had playing a city-builder game.Now, if you intend to buy the game, trust me. It's worth it. Wether you are like me and play for 15 hours and then get bored or for 100 or 1000, you will for sure have a great experience!~I would advise you however to look into other reviews too since i havent played the other Tropico games and they might be better than 4~With that being said Tropico 4 is a great game!Solid recommendation!

												If you already have tropico 3 dont buy this. It is the same game, except crappy graphics. I mean really, a down grade. Why? they turned all the distant trees into 2d images that dissapear the farther you get away, and I couldn't find any way to change this. There are hardly any gameplay differences. I feel like this was just pumped out for the sake of a sequel. But seriously why would a newer game have worse graphics than the one before it. That is why I enjoyed tropico 3 so much (that and it being a great  dictator/simcity/the sims combination game). Don't buy. If you don't have either only get tropico 3. I hope they don't screw up with tropico 5. With how bad tropico 4 was I don't know If I would risk buying number 5. There is just nothing that tropico 4 offers, that tropico 3 doesn't do better. Yes I know there are a few gameplay tweaks (including disasters, and new policies.) but just don't buy it.			",325,91,23,27,41,3,57

												Hello this is el Presidente! Penultimo says this game is very good. You must buy it and build a paradise.The game is very fun. One of the best city building/economic strategy games I've played.I've played only campaign, both main game and modern times. I liked both campaigns. Missions are interesting and different mostly. The game is not realistic, but it reflects the factions pretty well. Communists are always unhappy about healthcare and housing quality, religion faction always wants a new church built and faction leader always gets drunk in the pub, nationalist are killing immigrants, capitalists can do everything for money. Same as in real life. The dialogues and missions are fun and it will make you laugh. There was an earthquake and your mine collapsed and trapped the workers? You paid Chinese experts for the drill which will help to free them? Oh no Presidente the crappy Chinese drill exploded and triggered another earthquake.You can be good dictator, build a paradise where everyone is happy, has a job with high salary and free housing, people are free, etc. Maybe sometimes they get llama flu, but when you have a perfect healthcare it's not a problem.Or you could be a ruthless dictator, shooting at the protesters, living in polluted environment, keeping people in poverty, they die from a bad healthcare or starvation, are homeless. Where do their money go then? To your personal Swiss bank account.The graphics are really nice for a strategy game and performance is very good with everything maxed out on a mid range PC. Music is repetitive but it's not boring, it's not getting old.I know Tropico 5 is out already, but this one is much cheaper and already has all the DLC released.			",702,392,38,104,109,5,116

												Personal Rating: Good game but I liked Tropico 3 betterClassic Rating: ★★★☆☆I do not own any DLC (so far) and I think those might make some difference gameplay wise, so this review is based on vanilla.Keeping it short, hoping you've already played Tropico at least once, this is a nice game in the series with added challenges and game variations, compared to Tropico 3. What I did like better in Tropico 3 was the more freedom you got: I like having missions and objectives in all the games I play, because it gives me a path to follow and keeps me engaged while progressing but Tropico 4 has too many constraints IMHO. You'll be flooded by requests with almost no time left to organize your island the way you like, so the management aspect of the game really suffers a bit.Two good points which I'd like to highlight are the commentary, which is really funny to listen to and full translations in several languages which are always welcome to me.

												First, the Tropico series has not really progressesd much in gameplay and mechanics, so every Tropico release has always felt like a slight upgrade instead of a whole new game. And fans can live with that, as generally ""if it ain't broke...""Second, the value of this game assumes one of two paths; 1) you have been a fan of the series and are considrering T4 as an affordable upgrade to T3, or 2) you've never played Tropico of any flavor and are wondering where to jump in. For Tropico fans:Like 1-3, T4 doesn't change a lot of game mechanics. You get a new concept, ministers, which add a little bit more complexity, and you get several new buildings that allow a slightly different late-game strategy, these really become intriguing in sandbox mode (and you need all the DLCs, as expected). BUT, the downside of 4 is the graphics. No really, I have a nice rig and don't expect Steven Spielberg CGI graphics in a game like this, but T1 was better than this. How does it matter? Because you really need to see what you are doing in any build sim, and the graphics on T4 look like 16 bit Sega Genesis stuff. It truly sucks. The additional buildings and the building upgrade mechanics introduced are nice for the numbers nerd, but really the average sim-fan will be like WTF? The strategies you will use overall haven't changed since T1, and T4 doesn't really give you much more to work with, so if you have T3 or are deciding between T3 and T4, unless the price is no object and you have to see for yourself, stay with T3 and wait to see what T5+ may bring. If you are just a Tropico junky like me, the price is still cheap, go ahea, and see if you don't feel the same way. I had to try it to believe, and sure enough, it is true. T3 is the better Tropico.If you have never played Tropico:Look for the entire Tropico bundle with T3 and T4. It is on sale as well. play T4 first. Then step backwards to T3, give it a whirl, and you will also wonder why they didn't just release a further T3 DLC with some new buildings. It is that much of a let-down. Or just get T3 with the DLC, you'll wish you did in the end.PS: T4 requires a separate account login to kalypso, if you are like me you hate this stuff. T3 does not. T3 wins hands down.

												Would be great to actually play this game, if it were not for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ broken launcher that requires you to have an account, (which I already have apparently as I can't seem to register a new one with my current e-mail.) which wouldn't be so bad if the damn password recovery worked at all. gg kalypso. 0/10 as I can't play your game that I was suckered into buying because of it being on sale, without knowing you had crowbarred in you own pointless DRM.

												Another very solid entry in the Tropico franchise. Easy to grasp city-building with plenty of fun concepts to play around with. Crisp and pleasant graphics and sound really help drive home this game's vacation feel.Tropico 4 not only has a fun and interesting campaign, but a pretty fun and engaging sandbox mode as well. A lot of the time this genre only seems to be able to deliver one of these things, really enjoy getting both in one solid package here.If you like... city-builders, light-economic sims, freedom in attacking your objectives, the Caribbean, you'll like this game.If you always wanted to be a ""El Presidente"" or thought Jim Jones had some good ideas and just sort of messed up the execution - buy this game.

Unless you said El Presidente, you answered wrong. You had worthless dreams.I was such a kid, but it wasn't until I played this game that I realized what an unmotivated fool I was. Sure, like anyone I've thought about taking over a country or two, but never as El Presidente. Now I can fulfill a dream I never knew I had—absolute power over a chain of Caribbean islands—without (much of) a risk of Richard Nixon ordering my assassination.Now when you hear those sirensDon’t you think it's just a drillCause when El Presidente pulls the triggerHe always shoots to kill ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice city building game where you have to take care of your residents' needs. A successor to original Tropico game.Each citizen has its own needs and personality. You need to build houses for your residents, educate them, heal them, protect them, feed them and for sure, enjoy them. You have many ways to do each of theese things, but don't forget that your residents want some variety. They will not be happy if they will eat only one kind of meal. You may also trade with foreigners as you are El Presidente of your own nation. A communist nation by the way, so believe or not, even if it seems that your main objective is to serve your citizens, in fact, they are just a tool for your personal, secret top objective which is: misappropriate as much money as you can to your secret bank account. But don't tell it to your residents or they may assassinate you. Also, take care of an enemy army.			",733,158,61,90,308,8,201

TL/DR REVIEW: Very GoodI like Tropico a lot. It is clear the game doesn't take itself too serious, something a lot of developers can learn from. The city building and management is well designed, but not anything hardcore or super challenging. The characters provide fun backstory and humor that kept me interested throughout all the scenarios. Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. ",84,1,10,1,12,1,7

Look no further, Tropico 4 is an absolute gem of a strategy game.Not only is the game world a sunny paradise, lying to your people and other corrupt acts feel fleshed out as opposed to simply being stat modifiers, all thanks to the brilliant voice acting in this videojuego.Buy it or I will make sure your family is thrown into jail.

												Never really looked at this game before, but it came on sale and i thought why the hell not and pulled the trigger. I downloaded it and thought I'd give it a quick play..... 10 hours later I was thinking I'm hungry, tired and my wrist hurts and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this is addictive. The game is fantastic, i've never wanted to be a dictator before, but this game makes it so appealing. You are initially given a fairly delapidated old island village to bring back to glory whilst building farms and schools and churches all whilst dealing with international diplomacy and factions at home.This is one of the first times I haven't turned the music of in a game, the latino soundtrack compliments the game beautifully and its so upbeat. The graphics are really good when you max it out, you can see every detail of your emerging island and its people. I highly recommend this game, this will add up to many enjoyable hours that make it excellent value, I will be getting Tropico 5 now, thats for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The 4th edition in the comical Tropico Series. I've only played this and #3 at the time of review, but I can tell you the series is fun, as is this game. Each subsequent game doesn't see many improvements other than in graphics, but that's not what this review is about is it? Tropico is a city-building game set in the cold war where you create your benevolent, malevolent, or anything in between dictatorship. It focuses on a single island on a time for you to develop, each with different resources and prime strategies to exploit the island. From tourism, to exporting raw materials, to exporting finished goods. Maintain good relations relations with the super-powers or risk invasion. Receive foreign aid from those you are close to, and military protection from those whose♥♥♥♥♥you kiss. Or create and independent tropico for all of your natives, imported workers, and tourists (or lack thereof) to enjoy!+The graphics are superb+The sounds are good+The controls work just fine+It contains enough improvements over #3 to be worth the purchase from recurring fans of the series.+Has enough content to sustain the price.-Has a really bad marketing strategy. Just look at the DLC list.-Has some bugs.If you're new to Tropico then this is as good of a place as any to start. If you're old to the series, this is a huge improvement over everything before it. However as all tropico games before it, even if you make housing free, there's still that damn glitch of people simply refusing to use houses and thus ruining the beauty of your tropical nation. I give this game a 4/5. It's almost perfect for what it is, but needs some bugs ironed out (And this far from release? They never will be). Full price of $20? Totally worth it.

												Very charming humorous game. Get this and sit down with it in sandbox mode for an entire evening.You´ll have a nice relaqxed time with lots of smiling. Unless rebels. Or desasters. Or elections, those are annoying ;)I hope the next part gets a more sofisticated infrastructure and public transport system.			",338,106,9,52,31,2,67

												This is basically Sim City but with a Cuban dictator, if you're into the build your own city/god simulator kind of games then you should pick it up. It's pretty easy to get addicted and it's fun to start it up every once in a while.Only thing I don't like is the dlc, it's the whole one outfit and mission type of thing. Only dlc that really adds more to the game is the modern times dlc.			",197,23,6,14,16,2,34

												Great ""feel good"", relaxing, simulation game with a very fun story and characters. Controls might feel a bit awkward for someone used to ""classic"" RTS boxing and ""click a worker, issue build command"" gameplay, but that's why you start with this incarnation of Tropico instead of Tropico 3 - this game features a useful tutorial which actually explains how it is played. As in most other ""base building"" games, you start by creating an economy, which can be easy to overlook or underestimate.Some might call this a ""casual"" game, but I don't care. This game is guaranteed to put a smile on your face and make you feel better. The music is expectedly awesome and contributes to the overall impression a lot.			",64,29,0,15,8,0,21

												Tropico 4 is the best city build game i have played.The reason for this is the replayability.You get even in base game alot of missions(20) and a skirmish mode.You useally start out with a small group of people and need to keep your workplace around the amount of people you got(trust me it is very easy to overspent).But here is where tropico 4 flat out crushes other city builders.You accauly need to keep your people happy to avoid rebelions, militery coups, etc.You also got to keep the usa and usser off your back.You get several buildings to achieve the same goal.Want to build a booze free island?you can.Want to build a island where everyone is always drunk you can.Want to create a island of mindless minnions.You canWant to build a island of inteligent people again you can.The strenght in the game is it way of thinking.Here is a problem.Go fix it.You can make any kind socialty.Comunist, capitast, religeus, militerist. etc etcYou can make your own cult island.Or be a shiny example of free speech that makes the usa look like a dictatorship.I highly advise this to anyone looking for a great city build game.I highly disencourge this to anyone who has  an eight second attention span.

												A very good city builder but an awlful dictator simulator. As a dictator your would think you have to work more on stability than economy. The truth is in Tropico4, stability is not an issue and your people generally like you.You would not see protest, hard ethical choices. There is no coup, revolution or USA destabilzing your country. Well, maybe there is but I don't think the game represented these elements well. The only thing that is still functioning in this game is economy building, which is fun until at one point you just got ridiculous amount of money and the game got boring. As some has said, this game is too easy to be fun.			",18,0,0,2,5,0,10

I've checked everywhere for it, had them resend it, made sure my email was spelled correctly, and they still haven't sent the email.UPDATE:1 hour and three new email accounts later, still no email. Seriously, Kalypso? First you don't allow me to window Tropico 3 and then have me make a third party account for Tropico 4? That part I wouldn't mind if you could send the email. This is the last game I buy from this company. It's not worth the headache.UPDATE:After six hours, the email finally came. This game is really not worth the strugle.

												It is an interesting campaign where you (El Presidente) try to get money, florusih islands and fend off the great power and other figures. Each scenario are focused on different concepts of the game, such as tourism, mining, how to handle natural disasters or different intial setbacks. That way it does not get boring building the same island again and again.Not very difficult once you get the basics. It is simple to obtain high respect and income. Even if you screw up, you may be able to get back with the yearly foreign aid.A negative note is the low speed. You will end up playing 99% of the time at max speed since people move very slowly. Waiting for the builders to reach the construction site becomes very tedious, as well as waiting for the freighter to arrive to sell goods.About dlcs and modern times. Modern times adds a ton of new misions and even more new buildings. I would recommend buying it. The DLCS are not that good, they just add a not necessary building plus a standalone mission. They are not necessary and I would only acquire if bundled with the expansion or similar.			",104,31,3,15,19,0,34

												This game is a perfect mix of RTS elements from games like Age of Empires and Stronghold and City builders like Sim City or Cities in Motion. you have the basic population needs found in other city builders where you have to maintain health, food, security, entertainment etc.  as well you need to deal with the political side of ruling which I don't seem much in other games; you need to keep the different factions happy on your own island to avoid getting voted out of office and you need to keep relations with other countries high to ensure trade and extra investments with them. and while trying to balance all that you also have the security of your country to deal with; maintaining a sufficient military force to protect yourself from rebels and angry foreign nations. There are just so many ways you can play this game from a peaceful democratic leader to an evil militaristic dictator.I have been playing Tropico since the first one came out and it is one of those unique gems that no other game can replace.

												19 hours left, grab it for free at https://www.humblebundle.com/store/tropico-4-free-gameAs it's often the case with city builders, Tropico 4 is an effective time sink. On my first playthrough I only put it down when my eyes started hurting from drying out. I guess part of why it's hard to stop playing is that it has these (kind of) repetitive missions where you have to build your whole city up from scratch every time, but there's also an interesting enough storyline to make it all worthwhile.For people who have any idea what living in communism is like, Tropico 4 is a humorous reminder with timeless quotes from Great Leaders and decisions that would be unimaginable in Western democracies while quite pedestrian in the Soviet Union.Goodness of voice acting is worth a mention.Would definitely watch the proletariat fulfil a 5-year-plan in 4 years again.

												In Tropico 4 you play the part of a carribean dictator trying to develop various islands while under pressure from world super powers, rebel groups, unique terrain and mission limitations, and your own populace. In each mission you'll invariably start out with little more than a palace, a dock where you load and unload goods and immigrants, a few garages, a construction office for making new buildings, a teamster shop for transporting goods, and a handful of basic tier production facilities like farms, a mine, or a logging hut. It's up to you to decide how you're going to advance your people. Will you take a balanced approach that provides your people with lower tier jobs while you construct churches, health clinics, and apartments? Will you focus on factories and import raw materials? Will you rush for highschools and colleges in order to get electricity and higher tier industry? You're El Presidente, so you decide. Inevitably you'll find a strategy that works best for you, and I'm pleased to say that there seems to be a decent number of ""winning"" strategies. Crafting this strategy will take some effort, though, as you struggle between the competing demands of a tight budget and citizens who have the temerity of wanting basic housing and food. Regardless of your course in the game, I promise you're going to enjoy the charachters. From your woefully inept assistant and groovy hippie chick to the brash generalisimo and sultry teacher - every charachter brings amusing dialogue with suprisingly good (for the genre) delivery. The worst thing I can say about Tropico 4 is that it feels like an expansion pack for Tropico 3. That isn't to say there isn't plenty of content and missions, just that those expecting an engine jump or major changes are going to be dissapointed. Tropico 4 uses the exact same engine (with the exact same limitations) as its predecessor. Still, with the Tropico 4 collector's bundle going on sale regularly, this is an easy recommend. You'll get tons of enjoyment out of this title if you enjoy this genre.			",195,51,0,98,56,0,84

												Tropico 4 is the latest iteration of the popular City-Sim game that will please both new players and veterans alike. Once again, you take on the role of 'El Presidente', ruler of your own Tropical Island paradise. Gameplay is focused around Resource/Economy Management, Population Control, City Management, Defense, Trade and Politics. Veterans of the series will embrace the unchanged (and intuitive) gameplay mechanics from previous versions, and will enjoy the better graphics and more cohesive single player storyline. What a shine and spit of polish cannot cover up is that this version is extremely similar to Tropico 3 and likely does not justify the full release price tag. A definite recommend for new comers to the series but a hold (buy during Sale) for veterans. (Rated 8/10)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't played many games like tropico but I can safely say that it is a pretty good game with the experience I have with it.Pros:-A nice variety of buildings at the beginning-Fun and simple gameplay-Good humorCons:-There are only two good ways to make money(tourism and industry) and both of them will flood the whole island with money and the game will become too easy, it is still fun but it is not a very hard game(even if you try to limit yourself to make less money it will only make the game slower)-Buildings will get boring through multiple playthroughs since you will always have the same buildings(modern times dlc helps here a bit I guess)-Though it has decent music it will get repetitive(but you are playing on steam so just play some of your own music)-Factions are easy to please, and so are the foreign powers(it is too easy being on good terms with both the communists and the capitalists, the US and the USSR, out of all the factions these shouldn't be so easy to please)Alright, the game has some downsides but I still think that the game is very fun.

												Enjoyable! And highly so. Not without flaws, of course, but playable without any DLC and offering a good 30 hours of content in campaign only. So yeah, you buy that one in sale and you're set for quite some evenings of quite some fun.Although, be aware that you're playing as the dictator (or elected statesman, if you want to) of the very prototype of a ""Banana Republic"". Which is quite... ridculous in itself.Wanna get a taste? ""Presidente, an opposing power is sending a swarm of nuclear missiles our way... I'd suggest building wind power plants - with those 'airscrews' we should be able to move our island out of the way.""Had a quite good time here, and if you're into building sims it may be worth a look. Am rating a solid 8/10. Felt well entertained without too many real design failures.			",164,33,3,19,12,1,25

												Got this on humblebundle and boy howdy letmetellyouboutitSo, I got this nice little regime going on, economy is stable, wages are good, everyone's happy, when I suddenly feel the urge to have a random citizen assassinated in the middle of the street. It is done, because I am El Presidente.Afterwards, I start researching the guys family. He has three sons, and two daughters. One of them is named Romeo Russo. Sounds like an action hero name. Maybe this kid will grow up and overthrow me? Maybe.. I'll be keeping an eye on you, Russo..A few decades pass, and little Romeo has grown into a powerful general in my military, and has even married and started a family of his own. In fact, he very greatly resembles the man I had kill his father. Mayhaps he plans to draw my attention so he can be requested to kill someone and then refuse, thereby proving himself better than his father's assasin and myself? Probably.Unfortunately I am the High King of Tropico, and he just so happened to have married a member of my Secret Police.Accident is arranged, hearts are broken, children are left fatherless, and Presidente gives a speech so boring it caused my Minister of Economy to kill himself.Peoplearepubliclydemandingelections/10			",91,16,1,22,14,0,13

												First off, being a fan of the genre i had high expectations of this game...It did not disappoint :DYou can be a dictator and make your citizens as miserable as you want, only thinking about how much money you can put towards your own Swiss account, or you can actually keep everyone happy (except for the religious people, ♥♥♥♥ them) and actually survive when the Americans decide to come for your crude oil.Definitely give this game a try, it's fun.

												I'm a big fan of the original Tropico game as well as its odd sequel, but one thing I have to admit: Its a difficult game. Tropico 4, on the other hand, provides better balance. It starts off softly and if you play through the tutorial and the campaign mode, it eases the player in pretty good, yet it gets gradually more difficult as the game progresses. Combined with decent 3D-look, more content, the additional challenges, plenty of gameplay available with campaigns, sandbox and scenarios and a good amount of humor; its a great game, good sequel and a nice alternative for Sim City games.

												The campaign is absolutely amazing, following your life story as a president. It's very entertaining (and ridiculous :D). It never fails to impress me. The game guides you enough without making the gameplay too easy. You have plenty of room to do whatever you want. All the missions have something crazy  about them. Sometimes you will have to build a lot of docks  to confuse UN agents that are after you because they think you ordered an assasination of a president and sometimes you will try to get your country to hold the world record in ""The World's Smelliest Cheese"", ""The Most Interesting Animal"" or ""World's Lagrest Mustache on a Woman"".I don't own any DLCs and this game is one of the best!

												The game is pretty straight forward, you run an island similar to Cuba called Tropico and you have to keep the peace while keeping your job. I'ts a lot harder than it sounds and on more than one occasion I got my behind handed to me in rebellion. You have to find a balance between making money and jobs while keeping your stranglehold on the power of the island. 9/10 on graphics, game play, story line, and executionThe only draw back to the game is that the mouse controls are very unintuative and you have to fight with them to get the angle that you want/need to place a building relative to everythign around it. I'd give it a sold 10/10 if that weren't such an issue. If you can get past it like I did, you'd love the game just as much.			",31,8,1,8,13,0,8

												Sasha Baren Cohen starred in the 2012 movie, The Dictator.Tropico 4, is basically stepping into the life of General Admiral Aladeen.You play as one dictator from a variety of historical/fictional south american dictators, and set out to create an Tropical Island paradise as you see fit. The game is a sort of mix between the tried and true city building simulator genre made popular by sim city, and strategy games such as Civilization. This is unique, and puts tropico a step higher than other city simulators. The game is also inviting to history buffs as well. Taking place during the cold war, elements such as Military coups, juntas, nuclear proliferation, taiwan's independence, the bikini atoll testing, Nixon, and other people and events are mentioned. The game is quite charming overall, you'll be laughing at several political pundits, witty humor, absurdity of your advisors, and the caracterization of certain ideologies. But let's cut to the quick.Tropico is as followsCity sim with heavy political elements      You must juggle relations, and policies, as well as an army and a budgetgraphics are decentThe sound is incredibleLovely  soundtrack, with great voice acting.Small spanish grammatical errorsThe gameplay is fluid, full of replay value, and fun.9/10 would reccomend.

												Tropico is a really interesting series.  In a time when the classic RTS is nearly dead on PC, the Tropico series really stands tall as a remaining vestiage from the old Westwood Studios days.  Now that's not to say that Tropico is a classic PC-styled RTS, because it isn't at all, but it does have that same sort of one-more-game feeling.  Tropico is interesting because you never directly control any of your citizens.  You really only can build things and watch and your people use them or not use them.  That may sound boring but it becomes addictive trying to balance the needs of your citizens, versus the missions that the game presents you with.  You may need to strengthen your economy but your citizens are not well educated enough to work in the factories... do you take the time to educate your citizens or do you invite foreign experts to help out or do you pass a law allowing uneducated to work in the factories even though it adds a large risk to their health and well-being?  These kinds of decisions are commonplace in Tropico.  At its very core I find that Tropico is slightly flawed in that each mission can be won by following a bit of a spreadsheet mentality and carefully crafting the perfect island... but finding that out is half the fun of the game.  Tropico uses an unusual asthetic, the island dictatorship, and combines it with an interesting tweek to traditional RTS roots and the result is pretty damn fun!  It's also a game with excellent humor and many tongue-in-cheek charactures of the cold war era.  I really recommend grabbing the full Tropico 4 game with DLC if you can find it for 30$ or less.  I got well over 60 hours playing through ONLY the campign of 4 and the expansion.  I only started playing custom games after about 60 hours of gametime, so it's well worth the value of your dollar spent.			",260,65,4,48,40,2,67

Yes it's more forgiving than, say, Sim City but being a dictator should come with a few benefits.The DLC in the bundle really helps add some depth to what would otherwise be a fairly shallow game but shallow or not there's plenty of entertainment value for the price.Currently $5.99 for the game and all DLC, just buy it.

												Highly recommended if you'd like to play a fun and funny city builder that's equally relaxing and challenging. I enjoyed this game immensely, and I will recommend it to anyone looking for a great game.Downside: the traffic can get a bit out of control.Upside: so many.- Made me laugh a lot.- The storyline is immersive and makes for interesting situations, just like the randomly generated events and requests that come your way.- Balancing things out in this game is a very enjoyable challenge and I could not name any major problems in this aspect. It's fun and you have to work for it a little, but you get lost in the gameplay easily and it does not feel like a hassle.- The music is great, and even though it's a bit repetitive, you just can't get bored of it. It will get you in a good mood :)- The characters are fantastic. Laughably stereotipical. Love them or hate them, I bet you'll enjoy the dialogues.- The graphics are not jaw-dropping, but some parts of your island can be truly a sight to behold, and it's up to you to build a beautiful city. It's worth it to zoom in on occasion and just enjoy the view.- A very interesting glimpse into the world of politics. You don't have to care about it, I'm just saying, it gave me some food for thought and all I did was have tons of fun.I do not regret a cent or a second I've spent on completing this game.I'm gonna go achievement hunting now :DHave fun!

												TL:DR, I recomend this game, it's fun, addictive and a great time waster and I rate it a 8.8/10This game is a very addictive game, if you get easily addicted to games like, say FarmVille or TrainStation on Facebook or that on CityVille game (Whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it was called) then you'll freaking love this game, I'm not fully comparing this game to other facebook or browser games in general, it's far more than just that, this game takes elements from those types of games and creates a work of Art, if you got the money to spare, I do highly recomend buying this game and the DLC, there's really nothing bad about the game itself, the learning curve isn't that bad, this is one of those games that you can play to kill time, and it's quite easy to pick up.I've never done a bullet list in a review before but I'll try here.Pros Great Music and Sound. Very Instructional and easy to Understand. Mechanics are quite solid. Visually pleasing, albeit a bit dated. DLC is rather cheap. Campaign seems relatively solid, as with the rest of the game. Can cater to any skill level. Very Satisfying when you suss it out. Penalties aren't very harsh and can often be fixed with little loss (Unless you royally mess up). Very relaxing and soothing most of the time. Has a comedic touch to some notifications from advisors and such. You might end up acting spanish for a bit after playing.Not alot in the way of cons, mostly just fiddly things.Cons Requires a Kalypso Account to play (Can be avoided if you play in Offline Mode/Without Internet (It will time out and let you in)). Not a whole lot in the way in clothing options for creating a character but there's a good handful to choose from. In Late game there isn't a massive ammount of builing variety went it comes to housing tennants. Can be a real pain to get started but there's a few tricks to get kickstarted such as Cigars and Tobacco early game. Managing Jobs can become a hassle at times, all NPC's will go to the most paying Job and sometimes it's a real kick to the nuts.All 'n' All I rate this game an 8.8/10, the score would be higher if we didn't need a Third-Party account to play a singleplayer game, the Kalypso Account is solely to compare our campagin scores online, and as far as I know, it is not an optional thing, I'd already had a Kalypso Account from a game I'd bought quite some time ago so I never looked at work arounds.

Everything depends more or less on your choice's and it will show in the game.

												Hola, Amigos! It is I, your humble servant, Presidente, here to tell you about the glorious life that awaits you in Tropico... the Fourth!I love this game. Love it. Can't even begin to express how much love I have for it. Ask me what my most anticipated game at present is, and it's not the next big AAA experience, nor some indie puzzle darling, heck, part of me might even tell you it's not the games I'm trying to make. My most anticipated video game at present is Tropico 5, and that's entirely due to the strength of its predecessor. This game's steady stream of DLC, which recently ended, always got me amazingly excited, and I always tried to buy them whenever I could. As City builders go, it's accessible in all the right ways. Simple, but not dumb.First off, it's one of the most chill games I've ever played, not in its attitude, but in mine, while I play it. With Tropico 4, I like to sit back, relax, smile, and play. The game's script and attitude makes me chuckle--it's a humorous game, and one of the funniest titles to have been released in 2011 (has it really been that long?). There are tons of buildings that all work well together, and the new DLC buildings almost all feel as integral to the gameplay as the stuff that came before.Modern Times, the game's large expansion, was superb, sporting a large campaign that, among other things, involved building a ton of shanties to create a mirror to reflect a giant space laser.One thing that really makes Tropico 4 great, though, is the way choice and consequence works. Decisions you make early on in the game can prove to have incredibly positive benefits by the game's end. Or, of course, they can hurt you and drag things out. But... it's hard to lose, and that's a good thing. It's not that it's easy to win, it's just simply hard to completely fail the game. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've hit a negative balance in my account, only to come out swinging with $50,000 and $60,000 balances quickly stacking up after. Winning is fun, and losing's so rare, it's hard to feel bad about.The game is fun, but hey, you don't have to take my word for it, because there's a demo. Go pick it up. Kick back, relax, and give it a go. Have fun. And then realize that Tropico 4's going to give you a ton more of that, but with even more varied and diverse stuff.Tropico is yours for the making.

												Okay, most of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥s are just going to get this game for the cards. You're going to be missing out on finding that one elusive citizen born every 1000 years named 'Juan', whom you want to keep alive and safe by appointing him a very safe desk job and making sure he has access to decent healthcare. This will give you time to raise your secret police to pop a cap in his skull and make his family pay for the bullet, and if they choose not to and decide to take their story to the TV Station then you can just arrest them make and put them to work in the prison farms instead. Why do this? It unlocks an achievement!			",285,104,7,37,20,4,65

												Imagine Sim City, but set in a fictional Carribean island during the cold war. Now add eight bickering political factions and five high-and-mighty international powers, each with their own surprisingly intelligent and hilarious writing, and a 20-mission campaign that's proving to be incredibly addictive. While the first few years on your island tend to become repetitive as you log more and more hours, each island presents its own challenges, and the leaders you select (or create) always add their own twist to the mission. Finally, in a major departure from most civ-building games, the end goal isn't to build up a military; instead, your army is but one of the many things you need to take care of, and in certain cases can be completely ignored. Very happy to have paid extra to get this in the Humble Bundle, and will almost definitely get 5 when it comes out.			",53,21,1,16,24,1,36

												Amazing game! First i thought playing this game will be dull but when i started playing it instantly became fun and relaxing! The tropical music is really relaxing and it doesn't even get annoying. The graphics are beautiful! The gameplay is really fun there are lots of things that ♥♥♥♥ you up as hell like earthquakes and tornados :D!The missions aren't extremely hard nor easy. The people who give you missions are pretty darn annoying sometimes especially from the Religious faction. There's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way im closing the pubs! xD I really recommend this game to everyone who likes building games, being ♥♥♥♥ed by natural disasters and relaxing tropical music! Rated 10/10!

												City building and management simulator with a (tongue-in-cheek) twist - you play as dictator of a banana republic, some imaginary Carribean island nation of Tropico. This doesn't automatically make you a malevolent ruler, although the option is very much on the table. But you can be quite a benevolent leader, too, to avoid social unrest and having to create a police/martial law controlled state.Usually though, you'll play as a mix of both tyrant and quite legitimately democratically elected el presidente, swaying in one way or the other depending on how much actual support you currently have from your population (and there's a whole bunch of factions to appease, with often contradictory goals and beliefs, but you're going to focus on the most numerous ones, with most voters, won't you - politics, yo).While thematically quite distinct and lighthearted (dousing in cheerful latino music accentuates this), and generally comedic - the game is very much competent at what it does, simulating the needs and wants of your population down to individual people, quite organically punishing you for wrong choices by collapsing your economy and/or throwing you into a bloody civil war.Campaign makes you go island hopping, trying to build up individual islands of your nation, playing to their individual strenghts, so Tropico is the best nation ever in the entire world... but things of course inevitably but suddenly go south to comedic effects. Campaign missions have their unique predetermined goals and events, however otherwise play mostly like a sandbox game, and there's of course actual sandbox mode as well to keep you rolling.By now, at least gameplay wise, you'd maybe rather look at Tropico 5 which mixes things a bit more with multiple eras/stages of development, but this doesn't suddenly make Tropico 4 any worse or its campaign(s) no longer distinct.As for DLC business - there's plenty here in Tropico 4, and you definitely do want Modern Times which is a big expansion with its own campaign and new versions of many buildings. Other DLCs however aren't as crucial, but surely can provide some nice buildings like plantations* for more efficient agriculture or cement factory for quicker construction and resource-free export commodity, and there's always some new trait on your leader to select (this tweaks gameplay in some fashion, like more love from some faction or more efficiency in some area) and some specific mission to reinvigorate your desire to develop one more island rather than going pure sandbox again trying your own goals. It's just that for what they provide, they kind of seem individually quite pricey. (*sometimes new stuff may imbalance original campaign missions a bit, like I believe there was a mission with an island which was supposed to be agriculturally challenged and even disabled farms for you.. but didn't disable plantations (oversight?) so you could still start growing plants if you desired - not like your people would die of hunger otherwise unless you imported lots of food - you still could've had cattle ranches, it's just the mission was supposed to make you focus solely on industry rather than agriculture or tourism).

												God this game is really fun for those either looking for a challenge or just wanting to mess around in sandbox. Controls you can easily get the hang of, and other stuff. But the one thing about this is that, This isn't an average sim city copycat, Its basically something that you have to maintain happiness of your citizens, watch out for natural disasters and trying to get everyone to vote you. And basically means you have to have a healthy clean town, everyone has to be happy and basically there's goals for each thing, but unfortunatly if you do want to play this game you must register an account at their launcher site which is  HERE	[launcher.kalypsomedia.com] ",35,8,0,2,5,1,1

												Tropico is a great game, not as a  game to make the best island possible becaue keeping everyone happy isn't that hard. The beauty lies in the fact that the game rewards you to be a crazy dictator and still win the scenario. Playing as a religious zealot that keeps the amoral capalist US and the atheistic USSR from your back by running your own nuclear program, manned by your college educated priests with a personal churchbench for every citizen gets you a better score then kissing the behinds of foreign dignitaries while giving out free food for the poor and giving the US  cheap oil.Be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and be rewarded, that's the way to play and that's awesome.

												There's an easy way to recommend this game: did you like Tropico 3? If yes, you'll dig this, if not, pass. This game's called Tropico 4 but it's nominally an expansion pack to Tropico 3, though a large one at that. Tropico is a nation-building game in the vein of the Anno series, though not nearly as in-depth and with a sense of humor. It features a few new buildings and edicts and some new mechanics, as well as an entirely new campaign. A few of the added structures make things a little easier- like the salt mine, a mine that never runs out, and the chemical plant, a factory that requires no input. The mechanic improvements serve to streamline the gameplay and the added buildings are interesting. The campaign is quite good and about 40 hours long, a decent amount of play can be had. There is of course a sandbox mode if all you wish to build is an island. I very much recommend this game if you enjoy city or nation building games.			",714,201,33,112,78,8,164

												Even though I may not have the hours on steam with this game, i've played it on my Xbox 360. It is overall a great city making game, although the graphics may be a tad outdated, it is still worth the money.Stuff you can do in game, build a city, make a economy, declare war with either or all USSR, US, China, and a few others.Setting up your own democracy and the way you would like your island life to work. There are many forms of stuff in which you can do, you can try and be self suficent or aqquire help from other factions, for army help, food, resources and espcieally financal aid. You should do the tutorial to familarize yourself with some basic skills you will need to survive and strive as El Presidente.Pros+ Runs very smooth+ Cheap for a game of this type and quality+ Is extremly fun once you get set upCons- Graphics are a bit outdated- Windows 10 removes some important textures (Generation problems)- Takes awhile to establlish a system of economyHope this review helped my personal review 8/10Buy it!Rate up :D ",64,2,0,5,7,0,5

												Overall I feel Tropico 4 is a very good game, especially with its music and of caricatures representing the various factions you interact with. The game overall is very well balanced in my opinion, with the campaign being fun most of the time, even if it is a little repetitive, but that is to be expected in any city builder/economy management game, this does not detract from the sandbox experience which in my opinion is the best part of the game. I would definetly recommend this game to anyone it's a great experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think this is the best tropico game in the series so far, it is the right level of complexity and I feel that the tropico series really shows you how you make and spend money unlike in other city building games.The only downside is that you don't expand as quickly however the amount of detail you have to put into each island you work on is probably more, each building has to be placed individually.The campaign is also a great part to this game as it is very light hearted and the it give you very obscure goals to complete with each mission being very much different.

												Tropico 4 adds better graphics and some new buildings (Thats about it). Wind turbines no longer give out the power they did before in the previous versions, and theres some buildings that add some confusion to the game. They seem to be added for just a spacific senerio and left in to add just more content because they seem to have no purpose, kinda like the satalite dish in 3 which the only purpose was (to my knowledge) for the alian invasion scenerio, and that was it! Voice acting and music was better in all the previous versions too in my opinion. The building and edicts  icons are also confusing. They were better in all previous versions.All in all though, it isn't a bad game and I wont take it off my PC. The graphics is the games only redeeming quality, and besides that, it's mostly the same as the rest. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game (a DRM-Free version), over 200 hours, completed the normal game (no DLC's) and most challenges, and well...After seeing the messed up sale of Steam the other day, that had Tropico 4 with all DLC's at 99% instead of the 85% it was supposed to have (Instead of cost like 4€'s, it costed 0,27€'s), I decided to pick it up, mainly for the DLC's.Now, I sure had fun with this game. I f#cking love ""Sim City-like games"", and Tropico is no different. Instead of being the God and Savior of a big♥♥♥♥♥city, you're the main ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a little island. Yeah, that's it, you're the government, and just as in reality, government is corrupted, and filled with egomaniacs and a bunch of fat motherf#ckers. So that's a positive point to the game, it does feel right, it does make you feel like you're the Evil Morgan Freeman, and you're about to ruin arround half a thousand people's lifes.The game, sadly, has a few flaws. I haven't fully tested the DLC's yet, but it seems that some of them where just cosmetic items for the Presidente. Now that's lazy. Another big problem that I have found, is how inferior the Steam version looks, compared to the DRM-Free version: That one went smoother, with much less loading times and♥♥♥♥♥♥ I also had trouble making a new Kalipso account, but that's not the game's fault, the Outlook/Hotmail servers like to annoy their users, for some reason.Another problem I have with the game, is the soundtrack. Now, hear me on this one: It's quite great. It fits perfectly! So, what's wrong with it? It's repetitive as hell. After playing over 30 games that can easily take over 20-40 minutes, the soundtrack turns into a real pain, specially if you never liked that kind of music to begin with.The gameplay, though, it's great. Balanced and fun. My only issue, is that I don't usually get to see Rebel attacks and violent stuff. Not sure if I was too good at the game, or it's too darn easy. I do find Dark Souls an easy game (just with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t-forced Multiplayer, the ♥♥♥♥♥iest Games for Windows servers I've seen, and a few of GOOD bosses here and there), so it's problaby I'm just crazy and nuts.I still think this game can be easily recommended to Strategy players, but be aware, this kind of games have NOTHING TO DO with other strategy games like Age of Empires. You do NOT fight other players, you fight the system. Or in this case, you're the system, and you beat up anything on your way.For this Sale's price, I think it's a darn fine deal. If the sale finishes, you should probably wait for another one, or go look for a DRM-Free version of it, there are plenty over there, even in retail versions, I believe.But now, if the game would stop to tell me that Tropico 5 has been released...WHY WOULD I CARE ABOUT TROPICO 5, IF I'M ON THE 4 ONE!? LET ME FINISH THIS ONE FIRST, DON'T YOU THINK!?			",167,20,8,24,14,4,23

												Absolutely fantastic game, love it - it's similar gameplay to games like sim city but without all the annoying glitchy water pipe system, you also have to deal with relationships with foreign countries and factions within your own community e.g. religious, enviromentalists, capitalists etc and try to keep everyone happy, or not... :PYou also have to educate the people within your community to satisfy the jobs you make available whether it be industrial (factories), farming, teaching, doctors,ministers etc or you can always base your income around tourism.There are many ways of making money on your island, through natural resources such as metals,lumber,fish etc. However, if you lack natural resources on your island you can always import cheap natural resources and make them into more expensive good in your factories such as jewellery and furniture and export them at a greater price. Aswell as the option of developing your island as a 'tourist trap'. I really enjoy it and would recommend it, I play it for hours straight very happily, lots of fun :D			",175,79,5,25,11,0,17

												tyranny , dictatorship , oppression has never looked fun than in this game.basically you're a military coup leader , takeing over a piece of land , with population , doing what dictators do , aside from excuting who oppose you , you can also develop and build your very own empire. Viva la révolution.1) textures and layouts of buildings , people , life forms are on the verge between primitive or modern , in otherwords ""fine""2) missions are quite fun , theres mostly just one main goal , with secondary goals and objects achieved in the way to it.3) well if you like city builder simulator , you may like this game , because its not like city builder simulator , but it actually adds some spice on it , its more than just a plain city builder sim , with no other action or content than ....building?4) if you're not familiar with tropico or haven't play any previous tropico games before , its fine , they're not related to eachother , infact , its a fine upgrade with more choices and more contents than the previous ones.5) if this is the first time you play that kind of games at all , in my opinion it would be the best start.-Awesome game , i personally had enjoyed it , and i'd always recommend it with either full or discount price. 10/10.

												I'm surprised just how similar Tropico 4 is to it's predecessor Tropico 3. Infact I'd say apart from the graphics the game is almost identical.It's not a bad thing necessarily. Tropico 3 was a very good game in my opinion. However if deciding between this or it's predecessor 3, It's recommended to get the cheaper one since they're basically the same game.Granted Tropico 4 does have a lot more DLC that spices things up so that could be the counterbalance. But in general the game also suffers from the same problems Tropico 3 had. Namely the more casualised aspects of the Sim gameplay. Especially compared to Tropico 1 and 2.So if you enjoy a casual sim game where you play either a despot or a wealthy ruler, Tropico 4 is probably the one to go with. But if you want a game with more to it, look elsewhere.			",340,42,5,36,12,5,30

												I love this game! Traffic really jams up once you get into the 2000's. I have seen El Presidente ride in a car from one end of the island to the palace take 7 in game months ... lol But if you play it well, you can beat most maps well before then. It's awesome, and would definitely recommend this game to any strategy/ city builder fan :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tropico 4 builds upon Tropico 3 in almost every way. It's a very fun game that you can play multiple ways though several diffrent islands. There's even a island generator (which is rather basic compared to Tropico 1, but what do you expect when the premade islands are so detailed in this game.), or you can edit your own island. With Tropico 5 being out now, the price went down and now the whole set is 40 dollars. I say it's worth it, but fyi, Tropico loves to go on sale.			",94,9,1,14,19,1,18

												For the most part Tropico 4 is one of the first management games I've played in a while. I had a pretty massive gap with the my last really intense period of playing games from this genre involving Rollercoaster Tycoon and Theme Hospital, man those were some great games, then in the last few years I flirted with Football Manager before getting Cities in Motion and Tropico 4. What really drew me into Tropico 4 though is the theme and world that it built. While doing such world building isn't unique in management games, the world that Tropico 4 had built was. I was just really intrigued by the fact that you could attempt to embody some of the worst dictators in human history like Francois Duvalier or become a revolutionary like Fidel Castro or really be anything in between. I don't doubt that the reason behind this draw I felt to the game was my love for history and politics, so I'm pretty sure that anyone who has similar leanings is going to be drawn into the game much the same way I was.Tropico 4 isn't a game for everyone though. Hell, this entire genre isn't for everyone. At the end of the day the entire management genre is just spread sheet management and its your affinity with the world and theme the developers work on that is the reason you actually engage with it. All I can say for certain is that I really like the game, I enjoyed the use of real dictators, the work that was put into the music and art in the game and the fact that game as a whole doesn't take itself serious with all the characters in the game and its campaign being caricature of various historical figure. But I can definitely see that anyone who has no political or historical interests just won't find this game interesting at all and would lean towards another management game based on their interests.If you want to read a longer review of the game you can check it out on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/08/tropico-4.html.

												To get this gem on sale with all the DLC is one of the better investments on steam you can make. It remains the most in-depth and rewarding Tropico game to date and is a contender for the best city builder title on the market. Great music, real customization, loads of content, freedom with very lax limitations, unique role-play opportunities that promotes a lot of replayability; which overall easily beats the previous and follow-up titles that are a bit lacking in comparison.Rating: 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Made my costum character named Donald Trump. My rise to power was smooth no resistance from my people. And i did what i promised i closed the ""borders"", put more money into the army and economy. Untill i had no more left, i started asking my good Russian friends for some more.  And they delivered. As a good will i spoke some praise of them and how the west was evil. Russia and i become good Tropical friends. The Russians loved my islands coffee and cigars.Then started having problems with to many jobs and to little people on my small island. Meanwhile the world economy of coffee collapsed and my debts would go up. In the end the Americans invaded my New America. Awesome game if you get the hang of it. 8/10 would want get to invaded by the USA again.			",78,7,0,7,26,0,37

												If you like city building games, you are going to love this one. You can decide what kind of president you are going to be. Are you going to slave your people for that little bit of profit and a filled swiss bank account or are you going to create villa's by the sea? Are you going to bride, kill and sceam your way to the top or are you going to earn de loyalty and devotion from your people? Are you going to give people the rights on gaymarriage, abortion, lower taxes and free education?The game gives you an option to create your own president, male/female and special skills and handicaps or play as one of the famous presidents. Really a great game, the DLC Modern Times will let you play with even more buildings and options. This DLC is higly recommended. It gives 12 more scenarios.			",914,575,25,175,192,10,134

Been playing this game for a while now and got my moneys worth from it with plenty of different buildings and way's you can play this game! Industry, tourism or let the local peasants do some crop farming to make you rich. The point of the game is to build, sell your goods and keep your people happy before they revolt and turn all gorilla on ya♥♥♥♥♥ Adding the dlc will keep you even more entertained with even more building choice.

												I suck at this game.  So let's just get that out of the way, I'm TERRIBLE at this game.  But I love it, it's a blast.  Whether I'm dropping a condo onto a shanty town or I'm hiking the prices of medical care through the roof, life as a dictator is sweet.There are a ton of missions, each with altering goals but the same game play.  You'll have to please your people (Or don't, if you don't want to win and just think it's fun to play that way.  No harm no foul) if you want to stay in office long term.   It's a great game in a similar style as the city simulations, but with a ton of great humor mixed in.  I found myself regularly grinning and laughing at things I'd hear them say on the radio or to my dictator.			",164,21,0,36,34,1,38

Let's say number 4 is best for new players in Tropico, first one is best hands down for many reasons (including nostalgia and original concept) and 5 is basically combination of success.+Quests in campaign ""for being the world greatest el presidente!""+Sandbox mode+Graphics+Advisors and voices+City building mechanics+Catastrophes and random events-After medium-long time playing it get slightly repetitive-6 PM: ""I got a hour or so free...hmm let's play tropico? - 2 AM:"" WTF JUST HAPPENED?8,5/10 Our weathermen report that an enemy tornado is going to invade our island!

I do however recomand it because of the fact that it took me awhile to beat the campain and that it is hours full of fun.

												Excellent city building game. Good humour, well balanced gameplay. I love the way you can zoom into individual citizens and see their wants, desires and issues. Good variety of buildings too. Large amount of DLC which is good - but some DLC buildings are a bit overpowered. There are 20 campaign levels with a huge variety of challenges to complete - only downside is you have to start your city again each time. I've been enjoying the campaign for over a year, picking up the game and completing a new city every month or so. Great game and definitely looking forward to Tropico 5!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Who wouldn't love ruling as El Presidente? The main campaign is unfortunately plagued with some late-game gameplay issues (traffic, pollution, healthcare etc) which are all fortunately resolved by the Modern Times DLC. Overall, a large improvement over Tropico 3 and a good city/economy management game for people who don't want to go into too much detail.			",459,83,5,78,58,3,82

												This is an announcement from the Tropico Department of Truth and Equality: The interactive media known as ""Tropico 4"" today received personal recognition from El Presidente himself after his guards were forced to kick down El Presidente's door and drag him away from his computer to stop him from playing it. Despite having been locked away for more than a week, El Presidente is said to have been not at all unshaven, unwashed, sleep deprived and was definitely not wearing a nappy and a My Little Pony t-shirt.The news puts paid to the persistent rumours of El Presidente's death, kidnapping, suicide, resignation and departure from the island, abduction by aliens, attainment of sainthood and overthrower of the false god known as ""Yahweh""El Presidente today awareded this interactive media the Tropico Medal of Greatness, a medal hitherto only awarded to skilled ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that are good at keeping secrets.In reaction to El Presidente's return, all terrorists in the world are said to have committed suicide instantly, and any new acts of rebellion and terror are likely from newer terrorists, or those with extremely poor internet connections.This has been a broadcast from Tropico's Department of Truth and Equality, ordering you to buy this game and play it until you forget what the sun looks like.

												I have to say, I bought this game when it was on sale, I wasn't expecting too much. But if I'd knew, I'd bought it long before. A strategy game I haven't seen since Sim City series. Very intuitive, and a lot of ways to choose in your game. Either an oil king, or a tourism buccaneer. A democracy hero or the true dictator. But the best is hear stuffs like your general saying ""Presidente, an enemy tornado is coming"". lol			",41,3,1,7,8,0,3

												Welcome to Tropico El Presidente! Here you will find a beautiful game with a witty satirical look on the Caribbean during the Cold War. The game offers plenty of challenges and and twist to each mission that will have you managing your island for plenty of fun hours. If you are a fan of the SimCity or any kind of management simulator than this game is up your alley. If you have the extra cash laying about the DLCs attached to the game will add some but not much content to the game.			",71,8,3,11,25,1,23

												This game had intrigued me with its ads but I wasn't sure if it was worth a buy. Finally I got a good sale on it and was stoked to give it a shot. Sure enough this game is fantastic. Definetely has the same feel as other city building games but with some layers of complexity that feel really nice. Instead of putting you in a world that doesn't really make sense or is obviously fictional they give you something that could actually be plausible. I never knew I would enjoy playing the part of a island dictator but sure enough it's an original enough idea that I have been hooked for hours now. If you are on the fence about this game I would say definetely give it a try. If you enjoy games like Simcity or Banished it felt like a mix of the two with extra polital elements tacked on.

												Tropico 4: Steam Special Edition is the first game from Tropico series I have played. Here are my likes and dislikes:Pros:- Great sense of humor (no matter if you are interested in politic related issues or not the humor is great! building descriptions, radio messages, advisors, missions all are really funny - even for an adult player). - A decent graphic with a very detailed zoom-in option- 3-scale game speed up option - I usualy play in the fastest game mode - a wide variety of buildings - a lot of industrial buildings, tourist attractions, housing and social facilities and governmental institutions- interesting economy and political mechanisms -> as the el-presidente you make very important decisions (concerning economy, defence, external or interial policy, education etc.) and you can see what are the effects of your choices- factions - citizens in your island are diveded into a few major factions (religious, nationalists, communist etc.). Your job is to make them happy... or make them be quit :) - a lot of ways you can deal with unhappy citizens - you can bribe one, arrest him/her, arrange accident :) etc. - Music -> you can't hold your feet calm while playing to this caribbean music :)Cons: - a little bit similar development pattern - as the objectives in every mission are different, there is a very similar pattern to complete them. You need a lot of money. You can either develop your industry or invest in tourism. However, once you will find the pattern you like the most you do the same thing in every mission. All over again. - Bugged mission 18 (however bug doesn't occur always) - music - at the beginning you really like it... but after some time you discover that there are just 3 or 4 songs.... for hours of playing way too little. - it is difficult to lose the game - I am in mission 19 and so far I haven't lost one single game (although I needed to restart one mission :P )Finally, my opinion is... you definately should buy this game. If you enjoy strategy games based on economy and political grounds it is something for you. After hours of playing there is always something new you haven't seen yet. And after all, it is so fun to be El Presidente :P			",6,6,0,1,7,0,6

												Fun and immersive citybuilder in an original and colorful setting. Including the expansion and all the DLC the amount of things to do is almost endless and even without a discount the price is still very reasonable.Both graphically and gameplaywise T4 does lean heavily on its predecessor while being only slightly better, so you can skip part 3 altogether if you haven't played either one of them. To me Tropico 4 is the true followup to the original Tropico from 2001. In fact, I would even recommend this over Tropico 5. If you're a longtime fan of the series, you will probably find T4 more to your liking. While T5 takes an interesting new turn with dynasties and eras, T4 just feels more true to the idea behind the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have not played Tropico 1 or 2, I started with 3 and loved it. Once again Tropico delivers a fantastic city builder / economic management game and for those of you who have played Tropico 3, you will find that in terms of the interface and the graphics, not a great deal has changed. The graphics are slighty prettier (but then they were pretty good in 3 imho) and there are a couple of tweaks to the interface that might take 30 seconds or so to get used to, but thats about it.What it does bring however, is more depth in terms of gameplay and a more story orientated campaign to play through. There are a number of new buildings which have been introduced with their own functions, but for me the biggest improvement in the gameplay is the way the scenarios work. When campaign missions are initially presented, it isnt like 3 where you have to hit a specific goal or goals persay, more that in order to reach your goals you will have to fulfill and complete a number of in game missions in order to win the scenario. Along side this are a vast number of other missions that will pop up, which if you complete might award you money, faction respect, foreign power respect etc etc; you get the idea. This makes playing through the campaign (and even doing the sandbox island) a lot more fun.I have only 2 minor complaints; I wish the stats that you are presented in the almanac could be drilled down into more. I love stats and being able to have a little more depth would be great. The second, is that I miss the radio DJ from Tropico 3 :( On a final note, I would totally reccomend that anyone buying this (especially if you are coming off the back of Tropico 3) would do well to have a look at one or two of the guides available on steam. When I started I found that I was playing as if it was tropico 3 and not really utilising all the buildings and infrastructre very well. Looking at the guides help me understand certain aspects of the game better and also highlight why certain things I tried didnt work etc.Anyway, I love this game.10/10			",497,155,24,91,70,9,102

												A very interesting take on a country building / management game where strategy is the key. The array of buildings is quite impressive and the city decor is in ample supply with everything you need to make your mark on your carribean island. You can be a democratic leader giving your citizens all their rights, or become a tyrant and run a submissive country. BEWRAE TYRANTS!! You will make enemies in the form of rebels :) So Bon appetite. This game has decent game mechanics and has quite a in depth feel to it with a strong submerssive experience. You get to get involved in the politics, running of industry's, a commander, and an economic guru whilst all the while keeping relations happy with the U.S.A, U.S.S.R, China, Europe and the Middle East. When I bought it, I bought it on a whim and for a bargain price to at the time and now after many hours I can say its been very much worth it and I still haven't completed it or got bored with it. It could do with some glitches and bugs that could be fixed but they aren't that frequent I have found when playing. Also the game mechanics could be tweaked a little more and have even more building options. Thats just me being picky and my personal preference. I highly rate and recommend this game to anyone who is into this kind of genre. I will continue to keep playing it for many more hours. Nice work Kalypso :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here from Thailand where Tropico 5 is banned by Thai military junta led by Gen. Prayuth Chan-Ocha who did a coup 3 months ago, I bought Tropico 4 and have played it for a while.I would like to recommend this game since it let me learn more things about politics than I know. I can actually learn lessons about what a dictatorship can do when it is in power. I learn from this game about what and how authorities try to suppress their people, how it corrupts a country, how it comsumes people's wealth, and what they might do when there is a people fighting against them.I am an activist trying to spread billboards and flyers as a protest against the junta. I also use online social medias as communication between people who are doing this campaign and I use this game not only just for fun but also a resource of ideas and I thinks I get some ideas for our campaign.One last thing, please pray for freedom in Thailand. Enough men have died by their soldiers under control of the monarchy.Thank you...			",43,10,0,2,7,0,8

Though this game has a few points of improvement: if you are done with the story, the game gets boring because it's always the same thing over and over again.. So not much of a replay value.

												Tropico 4: Steam Special Edition is the first game from Tropico series I have played. Here are my likes and dislikes:Pros:- Great sense of humor (no matter if you are interested in politic related issues or not the humor is great! building descriptions, radio messages, advisors, missions all are really funny - even for an adult player). - A decent graphic with a very detailed zoom-in option- 3-scale game speed up option - I usualy play in the fastest game mode - a wide variety of buildings - a lot of industrial buildings, tourist attractions, housing and social facilities and governmental institutions- interesting economy and political mechanisms -> as the el-presidente you make very important decisions (concerning economy, defence, external or interial policy, education etc.) and you can see what are the effects of your choices- factions - citizens in your island are diveded into a few major factions (religious, nationalists, communist etc.). Your job is to make them happy... or make them be quit :) - a lot of ways you can deal with unhappy citizens - you can bribe one, arrest him/her, arrange accident :) etc. - Music -> you can't hold your feet calm while playing to this caribbean music :)Cons: - a little bit similar development pattern - as the objectives in every mission are different, there is a very similar pattern to complete them. You need a lot of money. You can either develop your industry or invest in tourism. However, once you will find the pattern you like the most you do the same thing in every mission. All over again. - Bugged mission 18 (however bug doesn't occur always) - music - at the beginning you really like it... but after some time you discover that there are just 3 or 4 songs.... for hours of playing way too little. - it is difficult to lose the game - I am in mission 19 and so far I haven't lost one single game (although I needed to restart one mission :P )Finally, my opinion is... you definately should buy this game. If you enjoy strategy games based on economy and political grounds it is something for you. After hours of playing there is always something new you haven't seen yet. And after all, it is so fun to be El Presidente :P			",6,6,0,1,7,0,6

												Tropico 4 is a great, in-depth look at how to manage and run a city and its economy. It differs to that of SimCity and Anno as the economy and the needs of the citizens are of great importance to succeeding; imagine running a Sim household translated to city scenario, with the different aspects of society affecting citizen happiness. It's very humourous and can be considered a great introuction to the city building/simulation genre. With the addition of the multiple factions in the game, including the rebels and foregin powers, you further have to micro-manage your expenses and make sure the right people are pleased. The game did teach me about the numerous factions which can be approriated to real life such as nationalists, commuinists, capitalists, loyalists etc, which adds, for lack of a better term, political realism to the game. You really get a hands on feel to what commodities are being produced, where you are generating money, and where you are losing it, with the aid of an Almanac displaying the numerical statatics of your city for easy referral. You dont feel seperated or alienated during the city building process as you are constantly being advised by the numerous, quirky characters, especially your loyally passionate, animated PA, and you do feel like your actions are being counted on which adds an additional layer of immersion. The soundtrack is EXCELLENT, albeit short (which therefore means you can hear you favourite track again shortly :D), with catchy jives and upbeat tempos as the tropican culture is captured perfectly and you do really feel like El Presidente amongst all the exotic instrumentation. The tutorial could have been further in-depth with explaining certain features as I had to resort to googling some aspects, but overall the campaign is great and it feels very rewarding when your exports return an enromous profit bringing you out of debt :P. The way in which the campaign is structured with individual missions means you can schedule and pace your gaming time, instead of wondering when the end is in sight. The different avenues of money-making, i.e. the numerous exporting commodities, means you can differ your stragety each time you play a mission, without routine-like, repeting methods. With the specific, analytical nature of the gameplay, you aren't looking at expansive, sprawling cities and skylines, so this game does create an attractive niche in the genre without detracting purpose to playing other mainstream city building games. I havent played the dlc campaigns yet, but in addition to that you get more outfit options for your avatar and decorations,  I wouldn't count them as must-have additions, the campaign dlc would probably be sufficient. I'm really keen to check out Tropico 5 now and see how it differs and what new features are implemented. Grabbing Tropico 4 (presumably the Steam Special Edition) for under $10 is well worth it, no buyers remorse. Overall, I rate this game 4 out of 5 spainards.(Forgive the long review, it's 4:30am and I'm carelessly indulging in my BA knowlege, I need sleep.)			",110,6,1,11,9,0,13

												Not having played any other game in the series, getting into Tropico 4 I was afraid of running face first into a learning curve wall, but was pleasantly surprised by the way the game was designed. It's intuitive and does a good job at explaining the core mechanics without holding your hand whilst talking down to you.What I mean is that Tropico 4 is extremely accessible. You almost cannot lose unless you overreach something fierce. Even then, you can tell when things aren't working out, and you're more often than not given time to rectify the situation. The difficulty lies in the unique stipulations and events of each individual scenario, which actually switches the gameplay up to the point where you get to work with all your tools and not just do the same build over and over. I appreciate that, because it's a welcome change of pace from a lot of other strategy games where you just find ""the best"" way to play and then repeat until the end credits.The ambience and tone of the game is spot on for what it goes for, keeping it light and humorous. It's chock-full of caricatured and satirized references to real life leaders and personalities, with plenty of jokes and easter eggs to keeps you entertained even when the gameplay starts getting repetetive and slow. Graphically, it's ok without being especially impressive. Thankfully it's not going for impressive, though, but rather functionally, which it is. You can run it on most systems without any problems. Everything's clear and you won't have any problems getting into the mood of the game.If you're an achievement hunter looking for another perfect clear, be aware that some of the ""harder"" achievements are rare because they're incredibly grind-heavy. I got stuck playing the same sandbox map over and over for more than 20 games after having cleared the campaigns, in order to get all character traits to level 5. Took hours and wasn't much fun after a while, although I hadn't maximized my char traits beforehand so some levels had been wasted.When it comes to DLC, I would actually advice against getting ""Modern Times"", since the buildings you get completely break the game. You will get stuff that just replaces everything you can get in the base game, and all difficulty is thrown out the window. It could be fun for a couple of games or a long sandbox game, but it'll get tired and it'll get tired fast. Just isn't worth it in my opinion.In conclusion, I warmly recommend it. Tropico 4 is a game that'll keep you busy for hours on end, and keep you entertained throughout. It's got character, atmosphere and tongue-in-cheek satire. It immerses you in the world of banana republics and continuously challenges you with new and innovative problems. Just don't bother with the ""Modern Times"" DLC, as it kind of breaks the flow of the game and makes it much too easy and simple. If it's on sale, get it! If it's not, but you like city builder strategy games, why not pick it up?			",143,59,0,12,7,0,9

												Tropico 4 is a great game! Although your workers will sit around with no active projects and there are 10 buildings that need to be built it is still an excellent game. If you like city builders where you can be what ever type of presedente you want, than this game is for you! 10/10 would kill the rebels again.P.S. There should be an edict about building shacks, and if the tropicans build them it is punishable by death!For a more real review though. This game is great. There are small flaws througout the game that can make the play experiance a bit frustrating, but they do not effect the game too badly. Overall it is a fun casual city builder that has great music, and funny dialogue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing if you're willing to invest the time to learn from it.  It's not only a great city building / politics hybrid game, but there's a lot of humor as well.  The soundtrack is very authentic and enjoyable and all in spanish, but very catchy and sets the mood well.  The campaign is very interesting throughout all 20 missions, this is a game that can make you lose track of time, Civ 5 style.  Once you learn the basic controls and how to setup your initial economy, you'll be hooked on this game and want to fire up a big ol' cigar!  Get this game if you've liked simcity type games, but always wondered what would happen if you could rig elections, eliminate threats, and build bigass statues of yourself.			",132,64,7,64,43,0,51

												Tropico 4 doesn’t reinvent the wheel but it certainly polishes it up. The gameplay is simple enough to learn but complex enough to keep you occupied.  Disasters, faction challenges, foreign powers and story objectives make the game even more challenging. The game is rife with political and social commentary that may provide a chuckle or two. The soundtrack is enjoyable even though it’s fairly repetitive. It should be noted that the population limit is low compared to other city sims and roads are easily congested due the lack of multiple lane highways. Still, these are only minor frustrations in an otherwise entertaining game nonetheless! Pick up the Modern Times expansion if you can!			",261,49,4,35,26,2,36

												Welcome to the fourth installment of the popular 'Tropico' franchise. Highly acclaimed with a ton of rave reviews, but is this game as good as people say? Yes. Yes it is.If you are new to the Tropico franchise like I was, then here is a very quick rundown of the game:You are El Presidente, the leader of a small Carribean 'paradise' called Tropico. Your main aim is to transform Tropico, an underdeveloped and practically lifeless bunch of Islands, into a world superpower by any and all means necessary. You will  straight up notice some very funny parallels to the real world as Tropico is basically Cuba, and El Presidente is based off a number of socialist and communist figures such as Fidel Castro and Che Guevera. Throughout the campaigns in the game you will have total control over Tropico which will see you lead your state onto the international platform for either good, or bad reasons. You will need to balance your popularity with your people by pleasing the various factions present within your society; something that is easier said than done. Similarly, you need to stay on the right side of the world superpowers as the game is based during the Cold War and your decisions will vary your popularity with the United States of America (US), or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). There are other world leaders but they don't threaten to invade you, well, as far as i'm aware anyway. Alongside all of this, you must work to transform Tropico by investing money into things like housing, welfare, food and resources, government, tourism, etc. Make sure you don't blow your budget too badly though because the world superpowers don't like broke countries. Also, prepare for major natural disasters that will kill your people, ruin your buildings and crops.Some people may read this and say 'This is just a mix of the Sims/Cities mixed with Democracy or something like that'. In a way maybe it is, but here is why I think Tropico is way better. Political corruption is encouraged in the game. Need to get more products out? Run a sweatshop. Rebels annoying you? Wire tap houses, impose martial law, conscript citizens into your army against their will. Getting too many immigrants and have shacks overunning your beautiful paradise? Force emigration. Faction leader or protesters becoming too popular? Have them eliminated or arrested for herecy. Minister of Foreign Affairs made a bad decision? Fire him and arrest him. . . See what I mean? How does this not sound fun?If you like being the corrupt leader of Cuba and focusing more on being famous than the wellbeing of your citizens who you can force to never leave a state with poor housing, bad health conditions, slave labour, conscription, propeganda, rebels, frequent natural disasters, and 'accidents' or disappearences happening way too reguarly.. than this is the game for you.Buy it. Play it. Live it.TROPICO 4. ",74,6,2,5,10,0,6

												I have not played Tropico 1 or 2, I started with 3 and loved it. Once again Tropico delivers a fantastic city builder / economic management game and for those of you who have played Tropico 3, you will find that in terms of the interface and the graphics, not a great deal has changed. The graphics are slighty prettier (but then they were pretty good in 3 imho) and there are a couple of tweaks to the interface that might take 30 seconds or so to get used to, but thats about it.What it does bring however, is more depth in terms of gameplay and a more story orientated campaign to play through. There are a number of new buildings which have been introduced with their own functions, but for me the biggest improvement in the gameplay is the way the scenarios work. When campaign missions are initially presented, it isnt like 3 where you have to hit a specific goal or goals persay, more that in order to reach your goals you will have to fulfill and complete a number of in game missions in order to win the scenario. Along side this are a vast number of other missions that will pop up, which if you complete might award you money, faction respect, foreign power respect etc etc; you get the idea. This makes playing through the campaign (and even doing the sandbox island) a lot more fun.I have only 2 minor complaints; I wish the stats that you are presented in the almanac could be drilled down into more. I love stats and being able to have a little more depth would be great. The second, is that I miss the radio DJ from Tropico 3 :( On a final note, I would totally reccomend that anyone buying this (especially if you are coming off the back of Tropico 3) would do well to have a look at one or two of the guides available on steam. When I started I found that I was playing as if it was tropico 3 and not really utilising all the buildings and infrastructre very well. Looking at the guides help me understand certain aspects of the game better and also highlight why certain things I tried didnt work etc.Anyway, I love this game.10/10			",497,155,24,91,70,9,102

												This game. There are no words I can use to describe it. It has hilarious characters who never stopped making me laugh. There were so many ways to achieve a single goal and so many different goals to achieve. So many paths to take. Are you a comrade of the USSR? Or Do you perfer being an aide to Uncle Sam? DO you care for the enviornment? Or is a strong military more important? Is God and Jesus Your savior or do you find salvation at the bottom of a bottle of tropican rum? You can do any and all of theese. Sometimes the game can be frustrating due to lag or just pure diffuculty and challenge. But it never stops entertaing me. 9/10			",56,4,3,12,5,1,8

												Tropico 4: Steam Special Edition is the first game from Tropico series I have played. Here are my likes and dislikes:Pros:- Great sense of humor (no matter if you are interested in politic related issues or not the humor is great! building descriptions, radio messages, advisors, missions all are really funny - even for an adult player). - A decent graphic with a very detailed zoom-in option- 3-scale game speed up option - I usualy play in the fastest game mode - a wide variety of buildings - a lot of industrial buildings, tourist attractions, housing and social facilities and governmental institutions- interesting economy and political mechanisms -> as the el-presidente you make very important decisions (concerning economy, defence, external or interial policy, education etc.) and you can see what are the effects of your choices- factions - citizens in your island are diveded into a few major factions (religious, nationalists, communist etc.). Your job is to make them happy... or make them be quit :) - a lot of ways you can deal with unhappy citizens - you can bribe one, arrest him/her, arrange accident :) etc. - Music -> you can't hold your feet calm while playing to this caribbean music :)Cons: - a little bit similar development pattern - as the objectives in every mission are different, there is a very similar pattern to complete them. You need a lot of money. You can either develop your industry or invest in tourism. However, once you will find the pattern you like the most you do the same thing in every mission. All over again. - Bugged mission 18 (however bug doesn't occur always) - music - at the beginning you really like it... but after some time you discover that there are just 3 or 4 songs.... for hours of playing way too little. - it is difficult to lose the game - I am in mission 19 and so far I haven't lost one single game (although I needed to restart one mission :P )Finally, my opinion is... you definately should buy this game. If you enjoy strategy games based on economy and political grounds it is something for you. After hours of playing there is always something new you haven't seen yet. And after all, it is so fun to be El Presidente :P			",6,6,0,1,7,0,6

												At first glance it's a simulation city game. And it is. But when you actually play it. It is far more than that. You are afterall a dictator in this game trying to either satisfy your citizen or your own future self (retired old man). To achieve that you can choose your way of ruling, go all in with the old fashioned way (the military way) or go all peace loving dictator.The first couple of hours was a learning course kinda bored me but then when i played on sandbox mode, a friend sent me a text asking how fun this game is. That was when it hit me, i could'nt believe myself sitting for 5 hours straight trying to satisfy all the NPC and Factions!			",123,13,6,14,15,1,24

												Ohhh Tropico, I believe it brings out the dictator in everyone, what can I say about this game? Well for starters it's your average city building simulator, except you know you're a cold war dictator, that being said, having absolute power does have it's perks, from arraging elections, building labor camps, and making people quietly dissaper. Although you can't be a dictator without people to rule (trust me I've tried) so you're gonna have to balance making your people happy and making your swiss bank account  happy, and making every citizen happy is not easy business, that being said, it can be a bit hard for newer players. All in all I reccomend it, if you're going to buy this game, spend the extra 10$ and get all the DLC, as it makes things a whole lot more intresting			",120,27,2,16,20,0,10

												One of my most favorite games. I love the humor in this game and the gameplay is very addictive. It's also a challenging game, which I like a lot. Though this game has a few points of improvement: if you are done with the story, the game gets boring because it's always the same thing over and over again.. So not much of a replay value.  And apparently Tropico 4 is almost the same as part 3 (though I've never played that one).			",77,36,1,9,16,2,13

												Here from Thailand where Tropico 5 is banned by Thai military junta led by Gen. Prayuth Chan-Ocha who did a coup 3 months ago, I bought Tropico 4 and have played it for a while.I would like to recommend this game since it let me learn more things about politics than I know. I can actually learn lessons about what a dictatorship can do when it is in power. I learn from this game about what and how authorities try to suppress their people, how it corrupts a country, how it comsumes people's wealth, and what they might do when there is a people fighting against them.I am an activist trying to spread billboards and flyers as a protest against the junta. I also use online social medias as communication between people who are doing this campaign and I use this game not only just for fun but also a resource of ideas and I thinks I get some ideas for our campaign.One last thing, please pray for freedom in Thailand. Enough men have died by their soldiers under control of the monarchy.Thank you...			",43,10,0,2,7,0,8

												A very interesting take on a country building / management game where strategy is the key. The array of buildings is quite impressive and the city decor is in ample supply with everything you need to make your mark on your carribean island. You can be a democratic leader giving your citizens all their rights, or become a tyrant and run a submissive country. BEWRAE TYRANTS!! You will make enemies in the form of rebels :) So Bon appetite. This game has decent game mechanics and has quite a in depth feel to it with a strong submerssive experience. You get to get involved in the politics, running of industry's, a commander, and an economic guru whilst all the while keeping relations happy with the U.S.A, U.S.S.R, China, Europe and the Middle East. When I bought it, I bought it on a whim and for a bargain price to at the time and now after many hours I can say its been very much worth it and I still haven't completed it or got bored with it. It could do with some glitches and bugs that could be fixed but they aren't that frequent I have found when playing. Also the game mechanics could be tweaked a little more and have even more building options. Thats just me being picky and my personal preference. I highly rate and recommend this game to anyone who is into this kind of genre. I will continue to keep playing it for many more hours. Nice work Kalypso :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tropico 4 is a great game! Although your workers will sit around with no active projects and there are 10 buildings that need to be built it is still an excellent game. If you like city builders where you can be what ever type of presedente you want, than this game is for you! 10/10 would kill the rebels again.P.S. There should be an edict about building shacks, and if the tropicans build them it is punishable by death!For a more real review though. This game is great. There are small flaws througout the game that can make the play experiance a bit frustrating, but they do not effect the game too badly. Overall it is a fun casual city builder that has great music, and funny dialogue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Welcome to the fourth installment of the popular 'Tropico' franchise. Highly acclaimed with a ton of rave reviews, but is this game as good as people say? Yes. Yes it is.If you are new to the Tropico franchise like I was, then here is a very quick rundown of the game:You are El Presidente, the leader of a small Carribean 'paradise' called Tropico. Your main aim is to transform Tropico, an underdeveloped and practically lifeless bunch of Islands, into a world superpower by any and all means necessary. You will  straight up notice some very funny parallels to the real world as Tropico is basically Cuba, and El Presidente is based off a number of socialist and communist figures such as Fidel Castro and Che Guevera. Throughout the campaigns in the game you will have total control over Tropico which will see you lead your state onto the international platform for either good, or bad reasons. You will need to balance your popularity with your people by pleasing the various factions present within your society; something that is easier said than done. Similarly, you need to stay on the right side of the world superpowers as the game is based during the Cold War and your decisions will vary your popularity with the United States of America (US), or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). There are other world leaders but they don't threaten to invade you, well, as far as i'm aware anyway. Alongside all of this, you must work to transform Tropico by investing money into things like housing, welfare, food and resources, government, tourism, etc. Make sure you don't blow your budget too badly though because the world superpowers don't like broke countries. Also, prepare for major natural disasters that will kill your people, ruin your buildings and crops.Some people may read this and say 'This is just a mix of the Sims/Cities mixed with Democracy or something like that'. In a way maybe it is, but here is why I think Tropico is way better. Political corruption is encouraged in the game. Need to get more products out? Run a sweatshop. Rebels annoying you? Wire tap houses, impose martial law, conscript citizens into your army against their will. Getting too many immigrants and have shacks overunning your beautiful paradise? Force emigration. Faction leader or protesters becoming too popular? Have them eliminated or arrested for herecy. Minister of Foreign Affairs made a bad decision? Fire him and arrest him. . . See what I mean? How does this not sound fun?If you like being the corrupt leader of Cuba and focusing more on being famous than the wellbeing of your citizens who you can force to never leave a state with poor housing, bad health conditions, slave labour, conscription, propeganda, rebels, frequent natural disasters, and 'accidents' or disappearences happening way too reguarly.. than this is the game for you.Buy it. Play it. Live it.TROPICO 4. ",74,6,2,5,10,0,6

												Ok first ill write the review for the game itself then ill go over why its better/worse than T5 as some may thinkAlright, so, city-building games in general don't usually get GREAT reviews but this game deserves better ratings (AKA underrated). The reason for this might be that SimCity already conquered and a title like this just probably will never seek fame as SimCity would. But this game is as good as SimCity. It's such a shame this game doesn't get more recognition as this game has great graphics, interesting campaign and funny character personalities.Now dont get me wrong. Im not saying all other city-building games are bad. Im just saying that this game should be on the level as the others are.Pros: Good graphics, greatly detailed, good campaign, funny charactersCons: DLC's, needs a bit more featuresAll in all it's a great game for it's price and i recommend it. I'd give at a 8.6/10Now for the♥♥♥♥♥♥that happened with T5T5 is a great game as well and although i haven't played it, i can tell both of these are amazing games, i mean, i follow the franchise completely and i can say both are excedingly good, heck, T5 looks like it has even more depth to it, but just like early T4 it's missing a lot of features, probably why it is getting all the hate, just wait a little longer, guys.So yeah, currently it MIGHT be better than T5 but hey, patience is key.

												If you're a fan of sandbox, builder games, you will like Tropico. Pros: The game itself falls just short of being a perennial, all-time classic. The music is great, the plot is fun, including quasi-historical background. Tons of replayability. Fun for fulfilling all of your dictator fantasies :)Pro and con: Tropico 1 and Tropico 4 are practically the same game. Nothing has changed.Cons: The whole Tropico series lacks a bit of polish that would make it ""best-game-ever"". Building can be slow, even on the maximum speed. When starting a new scenario, you tend to build the same stuff over and over. Sometimes the consequences/cost-benefit of buildings isn't always clear.			",120,44,2,19,22,1,29

												Not having played any other game in the series, getting into Tropico 4 I was afraid of running face first into a learning curve wall, but was pleasantly surprised by the way the game was designed. It's intuitive and does a good job at explaining the core mechanics without holding your hand whilst talking down to you.What I mean is that Tropico 4 is extremely accessible. You almost cannot lose unless you overreach something fierce. Even then, you can tell when things aren't working out, and you're more often than not given time to rectify the situation. The difficulty lies in the unique stipulations and events of each individual scenario, which actually switches the gameplay up to the point where you get to work with all your tools and not just do the same build over and over. I appreciate that, because it's a welcome change of pace from a lot of other strategy games where you just find ""the best"" way to play and then repeat until the end credits.The ambience and tone of the game is spot on for what it goes for, keeping it light and humorous. It's chock-full of caricatured and satirized references to real life leaders and personalities, with plenty of jokes and easter eggs to keeps you entertained even when the gameplay starts getting repetetive and slow. Graphically, it's ok without being especially impressive. Thankfully it's not going for impressive, though, but rather functionally, which it is. You can run it on most systems without any problems. Everything's clear and you won't have any problems getting into the mood of the game.If you're an achievement hunter looking for another perfect clear, be aware that some of the ""harder"" achievements are rare because they're incredibly grind-heavy. I got stuck playing the same sandbox map over and over for more than 20 games after having cleared the campaigns, in order to get all character traits to level 5. Took hours and wasn't much fun after a while, although I hadn't maximized my char traits beforehand so some levels had been wasted.When it comes to DLC, I would actually advice against getting ""Modern Times"", since the buildings you get completely break the game. You will get stuff that just replaces everything you can get in the base game, and all difficulty is thrown out the window. It could be fun for a couple of games or a long sandbox game, but it'll get tired and it'll get tired fast. Just isn't worth it in my opinion.In conclusion, I warmly recommend it. Tropico 4 is a game that'll keep you busy for hours on end, and keep you entertained throughout. It's got character, atmosphere and tongue-in-cheek satire. It immerses you in the world of banana republics and continuously challenges you with new and innovative problems. Just don't bother with the ""Modern Times"" DLC, as it kind of breaks the flow of the game and makes it much too easy and simple. If it's on sale, get it! If it's not, but you like city builder strategy games, why not pick it up?			",143,59,0,12,7,0,9

												El Presidente came to me in a dream. He was wearing only a white lace robe which did little to hide his bearlike hair. It floated elegantly in the breeze as he came in through my open window. Gently he cupped my head with his powerful hands, and he leaned in towards me. I could smell his breath, cigars and alcohol.

												If you've never played a Tropico game before, this is the one to get. If you already have Tropico 3 though, you might want to wait until Tropico 4's price goes down to $10 or $15, since the game is largely an expansion of Tropico 3. Still, the new elements of Tropico 4 are considerably fun.The most noticable difference is the 'trait levelling' system. As you play through the game, you'll gain experience in your chosen traits and start levelling them up, improving their beneficial effects. This adds a lot of replay value to the game, since it encourages you to pick different traits for your avatar and try playing with them in order to improve them, rather than simply picking a single set of traits you favor early on and never changing them.Tropico 4 also adds deeper levels of political intrigue; along with Tropico's usual internal factions and Cold War sabre-rattling between the US and USSR, there's now the European Union, China, and the Middle East.

												I was always skeptical when I saw this game on sale or in the shop, during the steam winter sale I finally took the plunge and purchased it. I was wrong to be skeptical. Tropico 4 is fun, vibrant, and doesn't take itself too seriously. You can choose to be a ruthless dictator, a tourism magnate, an oil tycoon, or a ruler for the people, by the people. The choices on your rulership and the comedy from your advisors make the game stand out. So far, I've enjoyed just about every aspect of the game and a play session doesn't last too long. The music is tropical and fun. I can't recommend this game more for civ-building games.			",63,26,0,15,11,2,8

												This game is really great and you should buy it.First, the cons: - There's a bit of a curve in figuring out exactly what the people think is reasonable (for example, protip: housing prices should be 1/3 of the person's salary, rounded down, and entertainment should be exactly their salary). - The missions are very scripted and the gameplay very freeform, resulting in occasional basically-guaranteed losses or complete non-challenges after you complete an objective and the next impossible-to-predict-the-first-time-trying scripted event occurs. - Being a tyrant is really underpowered vs. being totally nice and helpful.Besides that, this game is packed with wit, charm, and fun. Tropico 3 was just a remake of Tropico 1, but this game really takes strides in perfecting the forumula. Any good sim-builder needs lots of knobs and buttons to fiddle with, and this game has a bunch of them - and best of all, they're generally not packed painfully into drab numerical menus. There are no up and down buttons for employment; you actually click a socket for a worker's face to close it off and limit how many people the building will employ. This and *actually helpful* tooltips (some devs get it wrong, somehow) make the game immediately accessible. You'll have your work cut out for you balancing the desires of the various factions, and who you decide to please and who you decide to push to the brink of rebellion will often depend entirely on the resources of the island and your mission objectives. A huge problem with most games of this genre is the tendency for a single strategy to win every time; while this is still present in Tropico 4 to some degree, the missions are crafted carefully enough, with enough special conditions to disrupt your winning strategies, that it's less of a problem here than in any other game I've ever played in this genre.The writing in the game is top-notch and if you don't find yourself smirking from time to time at the bald-faced satire, then you need to get your sense of humor checked out. This game finds creative ways to poke fun at cold-war banana republics, stereotypes, popular video games, and more. At no point do you feel guilty for being a big, stupid tyrant, because all the international powers are bigger, stupider, and more tyrannical. This gives a fun sense of empathy to El Presidente despite his self-serving nature, and motivates you to shelter the helpless people of Tropico from the uncaring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on both sides of the iron curtain... and maybe launder some tax money as payment while you're doing them the service.I can't recommend this game highly enough. I've bought all the DLC and earned every achievement because I can't get enough of El Presidente. If you're actually considering this game enough to be here reading reviews about it, do yourself a favor and go for it.			",205,29,0,47,34,1,40

Not only is it a great builder game, it also0 has a campaign which will keep you playing for weeks and coming back for more. the options are endless as you strive to build the perfect island and keep all the factions happy. you can choose to profit from farming, industry or tourism. become a capitalist or communist. pro US or pro USSR, breed a large army to beat the rebels, hire a secret police to deal with them quietly. please an array of tourists from slobs, eco, wealthy and more. become the ultimate ruler of your own tropico island.

												Fun and immersive citybuilder in an original and colorful setting. Including the expansion and all the DLC the amount of things to do is almost endless and even without a discount the price is still very reasonable.Both graphically and gameplaywise T4 does lean heavily on its predecessor while being only slightly better, so you can skip part 3 altogether if you haven't played either one of them. To me Tropico 4 is the true followup to the original Tropico from 2001. In fact, I would even recommend this over Tropico 5. If you're a longtime fan of the series, you will probably find T4 more to your liking. While T5 takes an interesting new turn with dynasties and eras, T4 just feels more true to the idea behind the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an excellent game. This is the first I've ever purchased of the Tropico 4 series and from the sounds of it, Tropico 5 isn't much better than this. It's definitely a vamped up version of your City Simulator games where you can manage everything.... Straight down to the individual themselves. I recommend this game to anyone who is in search of a great City Simulator game. You won't regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like strategy games and city building this is the best for you (if you cant or dont want to buy Tropico5). There is alot to do and a lot to build. You can choose between lots of islands, and you can choose many different ways to rule your island. Its also great that the game has many different DLCs, so you can purchase those and get new outfits, houses and missions. You can also trigger on ""God-Mode"" which allows you build a beautifull town without worring about money.I really reccomend if you like strategy games, and you want to have fun for a long time. :)			",36,2,0,1,4,0,0

												This game had intrigued me with its ads but I wasn't sure if it was worth a buy. Finally I got a good sale on it and was stoked to give it a shot. Sure enough this game is fantastic. Definetely has the same feel as other city building games but with some layers of complexity that feel really nice. Instead of putting you in a world that doesn't really make sense or is obviously fictional they give you something that could actually be plausible. I never knew I would enjoy playing the part of a island dictator but sure enough it's an original enough idea that I have been hooked for hours now. If you are on the fence about this game I would say definetely give it a try. If you enjoy games like Simcity or Banished it felt like a mix of the two with extra polital elements tacked on.

												This game. There are no words I can use to describe it. It has hilarious characters who never stopped making me laugh. There were so many ways to achieve a single goal and so many different goals to achieve. So many paths to take. Are you a comrade of the USSR? Or Do you perfer being an aide to Uncle Sam? DO you care for the enviornment? Or is a strong military more important? Is God and Jesus Your savior or do you find salvation at the bottom of a bottle of tropican rum? You can do any and all of theese. Sometimes the game can be frustrating due to lag or just pure diffuculty and challenge. But it never stops entertaing me. 9/10			",56,4,3,12,5,1,8

												E' il primo tropico che provo e il gioco, se piace il genere, ti regala diverse soddisfazioni. Non l'ho preso prima perchè non lo conoscevo e grazie ad un sito l'ho preso gratis. Tropico 4 si presenta ben strutturato e con vari tipi di gioco possibili rendendo la longevità strettamente collegata all'immaginazione del giocatore. In che senso? Nel senso che, oltre ad offrire un bel po' di isole dove costruire la tua cittadina, ti offre anche numerosi metodi per fare crescere la tua isola sotto il punto di vista demografico ed economico. Possiamo benissimo paragonarlo alla realtà; Vogliamo puntare sul turismo? Bene valorizziamo il territorio, vogliamo puntare sullo sfruttamento della mano d'opera stile multinazionale sanguisughe? Bene potete. Quindi la durata e soprattutto il gusto di giocarci varia da giocatore a giocatore ed in base a come decide di comportarsi, è ovvio che un giocatore molto metodico che punta sempre sugli stessi fattori si annoierà prima rispetto ad un altro che preferisce uno stile di gioco più vario e ricco di sorprese. La grafica è senza infamia e senza lode, ma per gli appassionati del genere si sa, non è cosi rilevante come lo sarebbe in un fps perchè le priorità sono, ovviamente, altre.Consigliato!!

												This game is amazing if you're willing to invest the time to learn from it.  It's not only a great city building / politics hybrid game, but there's a lot of humor as well.  The soundtrack is very authentic and enjoyable and all in spanish, but very catchy and sets the mood well.  The campaign is very interesting throughout all 20 missions, this is a game that can make you lose track of time, Civ 5 style.  Once you learn the basic controls and how to setup your initial economy, you'll be hooked on this game and want to fire up a big ol' cigar!  Get this game if you've liked simcity type games, but always wondered what would happen if you could rig elections, eliminate threats, and build bigass statues of yourself.			",132,64,7,64,43,0,51

												Tropico 4 is a great game! Although your workers will sit around with no active projects and there are 10 buildings that need to be built it is still an excellent game. If you like city builders where you can be what ever type of presedente you want, than this game is for you! 10/10 would kill the rebels again.P.S. There should be an edict about building shacks, and if the tropicans build them it is punishable by death!For a more real review though. This game is great. There are small flaws througout the game that can make the play experiance a bit frustrating, but they do not effect the game too badly. Overall it is a fun casual city builder that has great music, and funny dialogue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not having played any other game in the series, getting into Tropico 4 I was afraid of running face first into a learning curve wall, but was pleasantly surprised by the way the game was designed. It's intuitive and does a good job at explaining the core mechanics without holding your hand whilst talking down to you.What I mean is that Tropico 4 is extremely accessible. You almost cannot lose unless you overreach something fierce. Even then, you can tell when things aren't working out, and you're more often than not given time to rectify the situation. The difficulty lies in the unique stipulations and events of each individual scenario, which actually switches the gameplay up to the point where you get to work with all your tools and not just do the same build over and over. I appreciate that, because it's a welcome change of pace from a lot of other strategy games where you just find ""the best"" way to play and then repeat until the end credits.The ambience and tone of the game is spot on for what it goes for, keeping it light and humorous. It's chock-full of caricatured and satirized references to real life leaders and personalities, with plenty of jokes and easter eggs to keeps you entertained even when the gameplay starts getting repetetive and slow. Graphically, it's ok without being especially impressive. Thankfully it's not going for impressive, though, but rather functionally, which it is. You can run it on most systems without any problems. Everything's clear and you won't have any problems getting into the mood of the game.If you're an achievement hunter looking for another perfect clear, be aware that some of the ""harder"" achievements are rare because they're incredibly grind-heavy. I got stuck playing the same sandbox map over and over for more than 20 games after having cleared the campaigns, in order to get all character traits to level 5. Took hours and wasn't much fun after a while, although I hadn't maximized my char traits beforehand so some levels had been wasted.When it comes to DLC, I would actually advice against getting ""Modern Times"", since the buildings you get completely break the game. You will get stuff that just replaces everything you can get in the base game, and all difficulty is thrown out the window. It could be fun for a couple of games or a long sandbox game, but it'll get tired and it'll get tired fast. Just isn't worth it in my opinion.In conclusion, I warmly recommend it. Tropico 4 is a game that'll keep you busy for hours on end, and keep you entertained throughout. It's got character, atmosphere and tongue-in-cheek satire. It immerses you in the world of banana republics and continuously challenges you with new and innovative problems. Just don't bother with the ""Modern Times"" DLC, as it kind of breaks the flow of the game and makes it much too easy and simple. If it's on sale, get it! If it's not, but you like city builder strategy games, why not pick it up?			",143,59,0,12,7,0,9

												Vote El Presidente... Or else!Tropico is one of those games that make you appreciate the fact that smaller companies create so good games!Well,the task in this game is quite simple, rule your island as the Dictator, El Presidente, keep the political relations with the other nations to a good level, provide food, work, housing and other important needs for your fellow followers, listen to some of your(at some points) terribly annoying advisors! And last, but not least- Lead TROPICO to the Glory.Alright, this might not sound particularly interesting for many of you, I assume... sounds like yet another boring strategy game, right? Well... actually no. There is so much more to it than meets the eye, hidden in the small details that make this game unique:-The set and atmosphere: You are on a tropical island, Earth's paradise, never before seen beauty. The perfect place to become a dictator! The islands are made so beautifully, it really sets you in the relaxing mood of the tropical culture, so to speak. It is just beautiful to look at, from any angle. The palm trees, the small animals, the buildings(some of which are hilarious), the cars(honestly, I love the design of the cars.. like come on.. who wouldnt drive a car like that in real life? I certainly would!!), and all other small details make up for a really sweet game.-The soundtrack: Now, as I said before, the atmosphere is just amazing. But hold on there, buddy!! It gets even better when the music starts playing. You felt like you are on the island before the music started? Ha, just wait till the music starts, you don't feel like...YOU ARE on the island, right there, just by the Palace of El Prez, listening to his speech regarding the last elections, which he won with the stunning 96% of votes, of course... his opponent went missing after that, Penultimo gave him a ticket to go to a vacation you know... there's nothing more to that.Beautiful soundtrack! They picked the music perfectly. It's one of the best out there for me personally. What better way to cheer yourself up than with some latino music, dances and songs!!!!!! Yaaaay!-The gameplay: simple, yet a little harder to master! Build buildings, get more people on the island, pray not to run out of money- profit out of it.Thing is, you need a strong economy early on, otherwise you will quickly run out of money. Start building tourist spots and them pesky tourists will just pour and pour money in El Presidente's Swiss Bank Account- that is all he needs to know! Build better housing for your citizens, pay them more when you earn more money, make them happy, win the next elections!Or just leave things as they are, gain a few rebels here and there, issue martial law, screw elections, survive an assassination attempt and keep ruling this beautiful nation that Tropico is! It is up to you! But beware, US ans USSR's ships are always seeking for that one moment to invade your country. El Prez must react fast! Quick, Penultimo, build that nuclear program.All in all, this is a fantastic game if you want to spend some free time gaming and to chill after a rough day! It makes you have fun and be happy.I have spent hundreds of hours on it on a non-steam version, and, believe me, every time i come back, I find something new. And this is what I cherish in Tropico!I strongly recommend this game to everyone			",64,16,0,8,7,1,7

												Gameplay, Tropico 4 doesn't delve too far from the generic mechanics of a city building simulation genre. You manage your city/nation's economy, monitor the population, provide housing, food, services and employment, and construct buildings for some of their other needs such as healthcare and spirituality. The definitive characteristic of this one's you'll be tasked to focus on one island and only one island at a time (unlike in Anno where you can build on other nearby islands, here, other islands are almost non-existent). There's also balance on this one in terms of freedom on how you want to run your island. You have options on where to run your economy, be it Tourism or other forms of industry chains.Another strong selling point of this game's the dialogue, the humor is strong in this one. I hope I can also befriend someone from the Middle East who promises me a camel but sends me 30,000 USD on my way instead. Something his wives found while cleaning the couch.Visuals, score and other things, nothing really stands out here.So, yeah. I'd give this one a commend. Buy the DLC's too, if you can. I heard they make the game a little more rounded with options.Camels/10 will be a dictator again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To start off - THIS IS THE BEST CITY BUILDER I HAVE PLAYED. I purchased this a while back, but didn't play much. After buying SimCity 2013 and playing some of that (and enjoying it for the most part), I decided to return to Tropico 4.The music in this game is amazing. Having a latin background, the music is really well picked for the game. I love all the options that you have in this game for buildings, laws etc. Gameplay is great, graphics are great, and maps are all very well sized and laid out. Much better than SimCity (map size was really my only complaint in that game). Anyways, if you like city builders, do yourself a favour and check out Tropico 4, or 3 for that matter. You won't regret it.			",283,46,21,40,45,8,35

It lacked so many features from previous games and took so much control away from the player that I had to give it a bad review.I can 100% recommend Tropico 4 though as it is easily the best in the series.

												Bursting at the seams with charming, satirical humour and a kickass caribbean/hispanic soundtrack, Tropico 4puts the players in the shoes of El Presidente, newly appointed leader of the island nation of Tropico. As el Presidente, the player can choose to govern the island in whatever manner as he/she pleases.The game mostly plays out as a kind of city sim, but with more/less complexity in some departments. On the political side of things, as El Presidente, you are in charge of the government's local and foreign policies, appointing ministers and even building your own army/glorified bodyguard force. However, the city-building aspects of zoning districts, managing utilities and directing traffic are vastly simplified. Ultimately, the game is an island economy simulator, with everything else existing to supplement it.Whilst the possibilities to play Tropico 4 however you want to play it is endless, the only two playstyles that will bring you any sort of success is to become a relentless industrial capitalist or relentless tourism-focused capitalist. Combine that with the game's huge focus on economy and moneymaking, and the campaign starts feeling repetitive.Hold on though! That is where the game's humour holds up it's otherwise weak campaign. Putting aside the campaign's nonsensical and overly convoluted plot, the characters have large personalities that brilliantly lampoon world leaders and common stereotypes. The characters give Tropico 4 a vibrant personality that is the shining pillar that holds it up above the multitude of other bland, boring city sims/ economy simulators.Like the islands in the game itself, one cannot be too fooled with the outwards image that Tropico 4 projects and ignore the less pretty, less polished inner workings. The interface, while elegantly simple, poorly presents vital data and is far too simple for the task of managing an island. Micromanagement is non-existent. Once your island reaches a critical mass of population, traffic inevitably slows down, frustrating all your plans.While I had fun with Tropico 4, it's many flaws stemming from the repetitive nature of it's fundamental gameplay mechanics holds it back from being a true representation of Caribbean island governance. However, the game's exuberant and charming humour serves to alleviate the lack in gameplay variety and somewhat dated graphics.I mean, who doesn't love El Presidente?

												Excellent city builder with intrinsic flaws. I love this game, it is a very good city builder sim. A lot of building types compliment and/or require other buildings, so there is a realistic synergy to how to plan and build a city. For instance you can mine ores and simply sell it. Or you could build factories to refine it and make items out of them and sell those. Most commercial building types have complimentary building types.It's a very layered game, but easy enough to get into, for novice or experienced city sim player alike.Downside is that your city will only last for a certain amount of years, but even with that there's usually ample time to develop and play one, and it has a lot of scenario's to play through as well as the ability to create your own scenario's. You can go as long as you want after a scenario ends but eventually cities become very unwieldy.Overall, a very enjoyable city building sim that touches all the bases; resource management, population, political, commerce and trade, natural disasters. It's the whole package, just served up in nice big scenario's to play through. with lots of inexpensive DLC's introducing new building types and scenario's to experiment with. And if you don't like any of those, create your own scenario with your own set of unique goals. ",42,26,0,50,19,1,5

												Stil addictive as everI bought tropico 1 on a market when i was a kid i only payed 5 gulden and then when i open it the ticket from the shop was stil there saying it was purchased for 95 gulden I was overly happy with the purchase and started playing it on my most crappy pc windows 95 i believe i had back then. the game compleetly got me hooked and tropico 4 is no excuse its have gotten better and better i hope tropico 5 gone be the biggest blast of this original city builder.but still there might not have been big change in the games up to tropico 4 but 5 gone take it to its next lvl but still from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 the game improved i need to say 4 is unbelievebale improvedbut stil im gone wait with 5 im not sure about it also 3 and 4 look very similiar only real diffrents is 4 has more room to fail then its ather version had.but stil i got tropico 1 for just 5 gulden to todays standards thats 10 euros and to compare that to dollar thats around 7.50 a 8.00 dollar i believe but this can always change the valuta's(gulden old coin of my country) Tropico will always be that gem you wane digg up dust off and just start and be el presidente and controll something youre fantasy wanted but couldnt do in the real world.

												This is quite an enjoyable game. Think a mexican styled Sim City. It's surprisingly addictive. Graphics aren't bad, gameplay is good. It's been a long time since I've played a Sim City styled game and I'm glad I picked this one up. I find it quite relaxing in comparison to a lot of other games I usually play. I can sit back, build my city slowly or quickly, whatever I feel is suitable. I'm only upto the 3rd or 4th campaign mission so far, but it seems like a good pick up to me at this point.

												Vote El Presidente... Or else!Tropico is one of those games that make you appreciate the fact that smaller companies create so good games!Well,the task in this game is quite simple, rule your island as the Dictator, El Presidente, keep the political relations with the other nations to a good level, provide food, work, housing and other important needs for your fellow followers, listen to some of your(at some points) terribly annoying advisors! And last, but not least- Lead TROPICO to the Glory.Alright, this might not sound particularly interesting for many of you, I assume... sounds like yet another boring strategy game, right? Well... actually no. There is so much more to it than meets the eye, hidden in the small details that make this game unique:-The set and atmosphere: You are on a tropical island, Earth's paradise, never before seen beauty. The perfect place to become a dictator! The islands are made so beautifully, it really sets you in the relaxing mood of the tropical culture, so to speak. It is just beautiful to look at, from any angle. The palm trees, the small animals, the buildings(some of which are hilarious), the cars(honestly, I love the design of the cars.. like come on.. who wouldnt drive a car like that in real life? I certainly would!!), and all other small details make up for a really sweet game.-The soundtrack: Now, as I said before, the atmosphere is just amazing. But hold on there, buddy!! It gets even better when the music starts playing. You felt like you are on the island before the music started? Ha, just wait till the music starts, you don't feel like...YOU ARE on the island, right there, just by the Palace of El Prez, listening to his speech regarding the last elections, which he won with the stunning 96% of votes, of course... his opponent went missing after that, Penultimo gave him a ticket to go to a vacation you know... there's nothing more to that.Beautiful soundtrack! They picked the music perfectly. It's one of the best out there for me personally. What better way to cheer yourself up than with some latino music, dances and songs!!!!!! Yaaaay!-The gameplay: simple, yet a little harder to master! Build buildings, get more people on the island, pray not to run out of money- profit out of it.Thing is, you need a strong economy early on, otherwise you will quickly run out of money. Start building tourist spots and them pesky tourists will just pour and pour money in El Presidente's Swiss Bank Account- that is all he needs to know! Build better housing for your citizens, pay them more when you earn more money, make them happy, win the next elections!Or just leave things as they are, gain a few rebels here and there, issue martial law, screw elections, survive an assassination attempt and keep ruling this beautiful nation that Tropico is! It is up to you! But beware, US ans USSR's ships are always seeking for that one moment to invade your country. El Prez must react fast! Quick, Penultimo, build that nuclear program.All in all, this is a fantastic game if you want to spend some free time gaming and to chill after a rough day! It makes you have fun and be happy.I have spent hundreds of hours on it on a non-steam version, and, believe me, every time i come back, I find something new. And this is what I cherish in Tropico!I strongly recommend this game to everyone			",64,16,0,8,7,1,7

Mediocrity at its best. Just play Civ or Sims. I don't enjoy giving negative reviews, and im barely able to not like a game. But this one, it was JUST right to make me click that don't reccomend button. The main reason being me barely able to sit through this 10 minutes.Pros: Nice music. A polished atmosphere.Cons: VERY unoptimized. Terrible graphics, even on max settings. Boring, generic Sims gameplay. First thing you have to do when booting the game is to sign in a 3rd party website.Such a wasted potential with a good atmosphere just makes me feel sad.I'd give it a 4/10.			",65,7,1,4,6,0,5

Tropico 4 is a great simulator-construction-management game. Excellent game to build a city on an island of your choice (each island one has a certain degree of difficulty, there are many interesting islands and my choice was not easy). It has several objectives to accomplish and it's very easy to get into debt.The game becomes even more interesting with the various DLC's which add a variety of events in the game (natural disasters like volcanoes, tornadoes or tsunamis, invasions of enemy factions, etc.) and it hardly becomes repetitive; I advise your purchase.The game goes far beyond its dictatorial order, is a true masterpiece at several levels: management, whether territorial, financial and human.+excellent graphics+simple and attractive gameplay+many President's to select+good ways to learn about economy and strategy+unlock of new structures as it moves forward in time+the play of colors in the game is spectacular (weather system)+soundtrack+DLC'sI have fulfilled my desire to be Salazar.My first Tropico game and I could not be more happier.

												If you're a fan of sandbox, builder games, you will like Tropico. Pros: The game itself falls just short of being a perennial, all-time classic. The music is great, the plot is fun, including quasi-historical background. Tons of replayability. Fun for fulfilling all of your dictator fantasies :)Pro and con: Tropico 1 and Tropico 4 are practically the same game. Nothing has changed.Cons: The whole Tropico series lacks a bit of polish that would make it ""best-game-ever"". Building can be slow, even on the maximum speed. When starting a new scenario, you tend to build the same stuff over and over. Sometimes the consequences/cost-benefit of buildings isn't always clear.			",120,44,2,19,22,1,29

												As much as this game is fun to start with, things can get rather repetitive. The campaign missions provided enough events to hold my attention, aswell as being a reasonable length so I didn't get bored, however after about 15 or so missions I found myself doing the same things over and over when building up the island. The major thing holding this game back is the number of buildings you can construct. The island you are given is far too large to accomodate creativitly and diversity in the construction of your buildings, as there is simply not enough buildings to do so. I've only purchased the original game and no DLC, so it may improve with those but I feel like the base game should at least have double the constructable buildings it has.All in all, I've found the game fun, and would recommend it if you're a city builder fan.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",119,14,0,8,11,2,10

												Wonderful game! For me it was very addictive game. I have many fails during my first attempts, but it lead me to discovering different sides of gameplay.Tropico isn't fast game. I like to build strong economy before accepting main missions. But it's not canonical.I think, everyone discover their own ""tropican"" way.

												Playing this Tropico is alot of fun, its different than the 3rd but non the less very enjoyable. There seems to be less bugs about buildings versus terrain, its good thats resolved. Though the secret to this game seems to be changing the import limit to max and starting a weapon factory with some local power to run the extras to make it more viable. the return on it is phenomial.In the end its not the latest but all the new stuff and the rearranged stuff are all great in their place! I do find it odd you get your achievements at the start of the next session, oh and having to make a third party account may seem trivial btu im sure its free information they sold to a third party.Because why else do you need something so pointless to run a game. Its great to play solo but nothing here is for online co op with friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",119,14,0,8,11,2,10

												Despite I only have played 14 hours Tropico 4, I thought to myself to write a short review of how I the game experience. I am experiencing Tropico 4 as super fun. In the beginning I found it quite difficult because I didn't know what exactly I was supposed to do. I have followed the tutorial. The clue is to build an entire city from scratch. The graphics are certainly not bad. Everything came to my expectations true, like the fact that I have managed to build a big city with almost no setback. I recommend you sure to play this game!!!

												I bought this game on an extreme sale not really expecting much other than some cheap entertainment, and I ended up being pleasantly surprised.The player take the role of a South American dictator who undergoes various trials to develop the island nation of Tropico.  You can choose to embrace US-style captialism, Soviet-style communism, or a tourism-based economy.  Your island is home to various competing interests that you must work to satisfy, so there's a lot of things to juggle.  The main campaign is challenging and diverse, I chose to play through that instead of just building stand-alone islands.One of the most unexpected positives of the game is that the campaign is just plain funny.  The banter between your dictator avatar, your advisors, the various diplomats you engage with, and the other NPCs is consistently entertaining, and is a well-written parody of Cold War era foreign relations with Latin America.My wife and I played the game side-by-side and enjoyed bantering about the various levels and the decisions that we made.

												I was about to thumb it down until I found a way to bypass that 2nd layer DRM....heh. So I guess my thumbs down turned into a thumbs up! Also I just notice on the store page it does say ""Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: Requires a free Kalypso account"", but I didn't get my copy through steam, rather through Humble Bundle (HB) which I was lucky enough to be browsing through at the time and checking up what's new there and I happen to come accross this[www.humblebundle.com] and thought ooh, free ay...? What's the catch...? - As there's always a catch to free stuff... In this case you needed to redeem the key within 7 days of and of course Tropico looked decent enough to redeem, I didn't want it to be sitting in my library doing nothing.As of this review, you still got eight hours left to go there and get your free copy!As for the game itself, yes I've actually played some of it; I finished the tutorial and finished the first campaign of the 20 there are, I will continue when ever.Game's like a city building type where you manage and micromanage your city. The only game I can relate this to is Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom (E:RotMK) as that's the only other city type building game I've played. If you've never played nor seen that well then basically you either start from scratch or have a preset of buildings/units that's already setup for you and you either build up from there and conquer the world, like in E:RotMK or build the best place to live in via Tropico.I've yet to invade or get invaded in Tropico so I can't comment on that, but with E:RotMK, assuming this game is the same, you can build up an army and go own a city and then they pay you *rent* money, as you now own them, either through hard cold cash or commodities like Silk or Rice that you want/need. So far, I'm at 12/20 of the campagins(i've finished the entire campaign, and still no ability to invade, the army is only there to fight back the rebels and hold order and that's about it.....pretty lame.... I haven't gotten invaded yet by the USSR or the US, but I'm guessing my army protects me from that too and can fend them? So they are able to invade, but I can't invade either? Or even Europe, Chine and the Middle East? LAME!Also so far I've found that they've recycled a couple of the maps in it through out the campaign...yet calling them different island names....which is odd... One of them is the island where there are no bauxite/iron/gold(so only income is import raw materials and export their final products and or tourism) and the other is where there's a temple at the bottom of the map with two gold mines and two iron mines above it and your base is at the top if you adjust the camera so that the bottom map is flush with the minimap view. Ok, now there's three maps that hve been recycled....Also, the ability to find who's unemployed and other details and such would be nice so I can employ them....and or do other stuff with them....And yeah......that's all I want to say about it...I suppose the other part of me forcing the thumbs up rather than keeping it down is that the graphics is decent, I haven't come across any bugs/glitches and that I like the game so far.====================================Played on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB and 1TB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't think I need to get into what makes Tropico unique - there are plenty of places to read about that. Let me just say that this is the best building game I have ever player - despite the fact that it is so much more forgiving than Tropico 1 was. The feel is great, the interface is easy to use, the voice acting is excellent (by far the best in the series and miles ahead of the dreadful Tropico 5), and as with all the games in the series you can win in so many different ways.

												Tropico 4 is probably the best iteration of this game. As you may guess the core mechanics of the game are basically the same of the previous iteration with some new ideas.Also the Modern Times expand beautifully after the end of the cold war.The great element in this game is the main campaign and the  ridicule character that populate those missions.The music are also good.

												I had always been curious to try this series and I'm glad that I eventually did. I started off with its third instalment and that got me hooked. This game improves upon an already good formula with its superior graphics, campaign and detail. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the series, think Caribbean city-builder. One of the most appealing things about this game is just its all-round humour. While being a tad childish, you can still get a laugh out of some of the jokes - especially the stereotypes. The game's awesome latin soundtrack is also pretty good too. It's a very self-aware game and that's why I love it. If you've never played a game in the series before, this is where you should start.			",61,11,4,5,7,1,3

												The most basic question from a lot of people when they look into Tropico 4 is this: Is it any better than Tropico 3?Short answer, In some ways yes and in other many sad ways nope. The Tropico series for those who haven't played any Tropico games at all is this. You are a Tin Pot Dictator of a small cluster of fictional Islands in the Carribean. You aim is to get rich stuffing as much money as you can into your off shore Swiss Bank Account and try and not get overthrow by the angry factions you have to appease, the people and finally the angry Cold War era Super Powers. Sounds simple right?But anyways, Tropico 4 versus 3. The general improvements between the two games don't seem massive to be brutally honest. Some of the problems from 3 are still there (triggering Edicts still has no visual effects apart from your bank balance, same graphics and the same damn music) but 4 brings some improvements to the table. It is clear they learnt something from the DLC and Expansion of Tropico 3 as quite a few features have been ported over to the newer game. I'm sure there is  a huge amount of under the hook tweaks and additions that make it a slightly smoother experince from Tropico 3.For one Tropico 4 has a bit more soul and is a lot more amusing. Instead of that single irritating Radio DJ with the same 6 voice clips El Presidente‎ pretty much shares his palace with his aides and faction heads who bring a new feature to the Tropico table with missions that appease your government, the factions or just a slightly easier way to help fill your bank balance or satisfy your people to some extent. And it isn't just your guys the faceless super powers from the first game have been given faces AND both the EU, China and the Middle East have joined in to squabble for your tiny Islands precious resources. This is a pretty good thing as it also gives you a reason to actually play the Main Campaign that has been tweaked a lot around these new additions. They also make sandbox games a slightly less tedious treck.There is of course the mandatory couple of new buildings of every type and a couple of new outfits to dress up your Corrupt Carribean Dictator too. And yeah sadly that is it. Of course there is also the suspicious hefty amount of DLC packs with a lot of additional content that should really have been in the game. This game really is more Tropico: The Directors Cut The Electric Phantom Part II than Tropico 4. But hey, they added Twitter with the Facebook Social functions and new achivements if that is your thing!I sort of wish they made the effort and a DLC that added some new Islands or Music as around the 20 hour mark like with a decent old movie you love to break out every few months to comfort yourself you eventually notice the limited flaws.So yeah, final word. Pick it up with all the DLC during a sale if you are a big Tropico/Management game fan or want to try something new.			",298,49,2,65,42,4,70

												Worth it's price! Recommended for budget lovers or even old fans of roller coaster typhoon or even fans of budget games. You have a budget to manage, several challenges and other elements that can cause set backs. Fantastic game and well done. Quite a bit fo humor too. Economy game with a sand box option. Its great.

												First time playing Tropico, its a nice game. You are El Presidente, ruler of a tiny island in the middle of nowhere, you can be a fair and honest presidente or be the greatest Dictator of all times.

												Build your tropical island paradise, or build a fascist dictatorship of tyrrany and oppression. In Tropico 4, you are the dictator of a small Caribbean island. Grow your nation, become an economical powerhouse, a military powerhouse, or a vacation paradise. One major upside to this game is that it has a lot more decoration buildings and items and isn't as strict about buildings needing to be placed near a road, like Tropico 5. So grab your guns and fight for tyranny and oppression, or against it!Viva Tropico! Viva El Presidente!			",48,9,1,7,26,2,12

I already have Tropico Steam Edition, but to be able to buy the Collector's Bundle I would need to buy the entire game again, as it's much cheaper than the cost of the DLC's added.Sorry, despite the fun it's just a sleazy grabbing attempt from the producers to get more money. Not from me, not again.Price of normal edition: 21 Euro. Price of Collector's Edition: 28. DLC price: almost 55 Euros. Robbery.Last time I buy anything from Kalypso. Ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As someone who adores Tropico 3, I felt skeptical about playing this game, since most of the assets are ripped straight from its predescessor, and the mechanics are very similar, although distinctly improved.What I discovered when I finally got around to playing it, however, is a beautifully silly game. Where Tropico 3 had tossed out puns and occasional tongue-in-cheek exclamations over the radio, Tropico 4 has mostly-voiced campaigns, a suite of comedic characters with hilarious interactions, a genuinely funny radio announcement for a lot of the buildings (which does not play as frustratingly frequently as in 3), and a distinct sense of absurdity in the very structure of the campaign. For instance, one of the campaign missions has a series of voice clips which are direct spoofs of ""the most interesting man in the world,"" which left me giggling to myself.			",188,55,6,22,46,1,56

												Haemimont and Kalypso really struck gold with this one. Re-labelling Tropico 3 and marketing it as a new game was really brilliant. I'm very glad I had the opportunity to pay for another copy of Tropico 3, since I enjoyed it so much. I also enjoyed paying for the nickel-and-dime DLC that adds a pitiful amount of buildings that took all of five minutes to cobble together in Haemimont's modeling software. This is really the most pathetic cash grab gaming has ever seen.♥♥♥♥ you Kalypso.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I felt from the very beginning I played this game this one was good. However other people don't think that way:  ''I don't like it. Its a rubish game''- Said me a friend.I like it but that doesn't mean you will like it. I enjoy it 'cause I play  meanwhile i'm watching a film or speaking with friends by any software or doing whatever. That's because this game is a bit slow. For example, you need X $ to build something. If you don't have that money you won't build it and that's why you must wait and since waiting isn't funny doing another thing wil keep you enjoyed the time you are waiting. Apart from that problem I can't say anything more bad about this gem. ITs a really funny game with lot of action and interesting things. All levels are difficult and you must thing whats the best way to be rich in all of them. So coming again to the question if I'd recommend it: I will to those people who likes doing 2 things at once and to those who like calm games of building a city. And well, i wouldn't pay more than 5€ for this, maybe 10€ if you really want it. If it helped you like it! :P Thanks and have a good day!			",98,11,4,19,7,0,10

												I enabled free housing after building so many condos to make my people happy and rid my beautiful country from their filthy slums. Bad Idea. The condos remained uninhabited and the ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥ kept building more slums after I destroyed them, I gave them enough warnings to stop. I had to do what any civilized leader would do.....I sent hitmen from my army to track each of them down, one by one. The ones who built their slums away from the city got to be deported and jailed elsewhere, whereas those who dared to bring filth into my city were executed. And any uprising that fought against my power would end with severe consequences. I swear to you, I remembered the faces of each one of the rebels and kept note on where they lived and killed them all.TL;DR10/10 IGN			",163,28,1,11,11,1,9

												One of the most funny management game ever made, with striking (according to taste) tropical soundtrack and decent graphics, but his relatively easy mechanical reduces the replayability for method players: first search for resources and planning explotations, then make scheme of roads and infrastructures, afterwards, making building schemes of residential and leisure areas, and so on.

												I felt from the very beginning I played this game this one was good. However other people don't think that way:  ''I don't like it. Its a rubish game''- Said me a friend.I like it but that doesn't mean you will like it. I enjoy it 'cause I play  meanwhile i'm watching a film or speaking with friends by any software or doing whatever. That's because this game is a bit slow. For example, you need X $ to build something. If you don't have that money you won't build it and that's why you must wait and since waiting isn't funny doing another thing wil keep you enjoyed the time you are waiting. Apart from that problem I can't say anything more bad about this gem. ITs a really funny game with lot of action and interesting things. All levels are difficult and you must thing whats the best way to be rich in all of them. So coming again to the question if I'd recommend it: I will to those people who likes doing 2 things at once and to those who like calm games of building a city. And well, i wouldn't pay more than 5€ for this, maybe 10€ if you really want it. If it helped you like it! :P Thanks and have a good day!			",98,11,4,19,7,0,10

												Disclaimer: I Recieved this product for free through a giveaway, none of the DLC's were included so this is just a barebones version.  With that said, Tropico 4 is a city builder with some economic, political, and trade elements to it. Doesn't hold a candle though in comparison to other civilization games such as Banished and City Skylines with have more depth, intrigue, economy management, and city planning elements.

												Excellent economics, politics, logistics and overall city building simulation featuring very nicely done funny and overly stereotypical characters.It is true that the basic Tropico 4 is just an improved Tropico 3 which even uses the same engine and mostly the same graphical assets. But the additions are improvements in my oppinion and the things added later with the Modern Times DLC make the game very different from its predecessor. I wouldn't recommend any of the other DLCs unless you buy a whole bundle because the one mission and one building they each provide are barely worth one €uro and most of the added buildings are unbalanced in a way so they just make the game a less difficult.The simulation is very detailed, so you can actually follow every single person on your island on their daily routes through your cities. Finding out about their needs and their thoughts is actually possible. But most of the times I didn't invest too much time into that and focussed on macro-mechanics. Managing to keep your standings on sane levels with both your factions and foreign powers while at the same time doing what is needed to win the mission can be a hard job sometimes.After a long time of playing and optimizing my strategies, the worst thing I found in the game is a point in each round, where the tension is finally removed because the economy is working well, money is flowing in and the people just love you. There was barely ever a game in which there appeared any new difficulty after that point. If you just consider this situation a win it all becomes less of a problem.Another slightly flawed concept seems to be the money in the swiss bank account you can gather through different ways. It makes you have less money available to spend on infrastructure and does not have any other use than improving your game's score. In a future Tropico I hope there is some further use to that. Mechanically sometimes the street building through rocky areas is a bit annoying because you cannot remove the rocks and sometimes need to remove pieces of streets again because there is no angle available anymore to attach a further piece.Also a very unneccessary annoyance is the additional Kalypso account you need to register to access the game. One would think that the need to have a logged in Steam account would be enough to verify that you own the game. I hope for their next game they realize that annoying their legal customers is not a good way to counter piracy.Overall the game gave me more than 120 hours of much appreciated gameplay. I damn well recommend buying this, especially as a complete bundle on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Put into the role of a leader of a tropical nation, you will find yourself deciding to provide fair treatment to your people or to rule them with an iron fist.You spend your money (and tax dollars from your people) on things that will make your city better. Whether you choose to cater to your people with local jobs and exports or outsource and try to bring in tourism, it's all up to you.There are options for corruption too. You can get protesters ""removed"" or run fraudulent banks that will skim off parts of the money for your private off-shore bank account.The choice is yours, but the worse you treat your people the more likely it is you will get assassinated and the game is over.81/100			",645,102,42,87,88,11,104

												Excellent economics, politics, logistics and overall city building simulation featuring very nicely done funny and overly stereotypical characters.It is true that the basic Tropico 4 is just an improved Tropico 3 which even uses the same engine and mostly the same graphical assets. But the additions are improvements in my oppinion and the things added later with the Modern Times DLC make the game very different from its predecessor. I wouldn't recommend any of the other DLCs unless you buy a whole bundle because the one mission and one building they each provide are barely worth one €uro and most of the added buildings are unbalanced in a way so they just make the game a less difficult.The simulation is very detailed, so you can actually follow every single person on your island on their daily routes through your cities. Finding out about their needs and their thoughts is actually possible. But most of the times I didn't invest too much time into that and focussed on macro-mechanics. Managing to keep your standings on sane levels with both your factions and foreign powers while at the same time doing what is needed to win the mission can be a hard job sometimes.After a long time of playing and optimizing my strategies, the worst thing I found in the game is a point in each round, where the tension is finally removed because the economy is working well, money is flowing in and the people just love you. There was barely ever a game in which there appeared any new difficulty after that point. If you just consider this situation a win it all becomes less of a problem.Another slightly flawed concept seems to be the money in the swiss bank account you can gather through different ways. It makes you have less money available to spend on infrastructure and does not have any other use than improving your game's score. In a future Tropico I hope there is some further use to that. Mechanically sometimes the street building through rocky areas is a bit annoying because you cannot remove the rocks and sometimes need to remove pieces of streets again because there is no angle available anymore to attach a further piece.Also a very unneccessary annoyance is the additional Kalypso account you need to register to access the game. One would think that the need to have a logged in Steam account would be enough to verify that you own the game. I hope for their next game they realize that annoying their legal customers is not a good way to counter piracy.Overall the game gave me more than 120 hours of much appreciated gameplay. I damn well recommend buying this, especially as a complete bundle on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played a couple of Tropicos, but this game really bugged my, not the game itself, but the fact that you had to create a login with a valid e-mail adress etc to even be able to play it. That and the launcher with various commercials for other games from the distributor just puts me off. Fair enough for a free game, but with a game I do pay money to play, I most definetly feel I shouldn't be hazzled with stuff like that.			",60,12,2,14,25,2,37

												This game as a city builder and government simulation game is a perfect mixture of genres. You build and industrialize a small island in the Caribbean during the cold war times throughout the game the USSR and USA are constantly fighting for your favor a perfect example of the small conflicts of the cold war that don't get too much attention. The characters that appear to you in the game are all very well done caricatures of their home nation or political alignment and are good for a quick laugh when they bring up the issues of the island to you. The game is complex enough for a veteran of these type of games to enjoy it and simple enough for newcomers to have fun too. You can choose from many ways to rule your country, a democracy, a dictatorship, nationalist, communist. the diversity makes this game feel to have no limits and infinite possibilities. I give this game a 9/10 if you want to get into city builder games or civilization type games this is a good stepping stone.			",28,5,0,3,4,1,7

												I have not played any earlier or later game in this series so I can not compare this one to them. The game is charming and fun for a little while but the game play gets monotonous rather soon, aspecially in the campaign mood. The constant bossanova music drives me crazy after an hour or so, but I guess that is a matter of taste. The satire is funny now and then, but of a rather expected kind, no real suprises there. Overall a nice game, but nothing that really nails it for me, and yet worldbuilder games are my cup of tea. If you feel the price is right for you can get it and have a little fun with it, but there are others worldbuilder games that offer more replayability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bad game. Won't let you play the game without installing a third party DRM client. I should not have to have an additional non-steam game account to play a game I purchased, especially not when the game itself doesn't even tell you that you require a second account. Would have refunded on the spot if Steam let me, will never play a Haemimont Games or Kalypso Media product again, after they have effectively stolen money from me, not letting me use the product I paid for. Only reinstalled the game again so that I could write this review. It's a shame because I was looking forward to this game, its meant to be really good but I will not support anti-consumer measures like this and I won't risk the rest of my steam library to play a game made by people that think this is acceptable.

												Everyone has at least heard of one game in the highly anticipated, highly thought-of franchise 'Tropico' And, well, there's a damn good reason why.Let's do a little bit of the story here...You are El Presidante, and you have just inhabited the island! Sounds easy enough, right? I mean, running an island shouldn't be that hard... right?.. right?! Wrong. This game is hard-as-nails, and it doesn't hide it. You're gonna have to learn to manage your money, look after citizens, control riots and well, just make your island the best it can be, no one wants to visit a dead, deserted island. If you're a fan of city builders and amazing music, get this game!9/10			",366,113,4,36,40,2,37

												tl;dr: Tropico 4 has a pretty large fanbase and a very distinct, very enjoyable style to it. Its more of a feeling than a game, and albeit being very fun it becomes old quickly, further down in this review I will elaborate on this. I dont think it is worth 14,99€ just for that, so definately do wait for a sale before picking this up if you wanna be cautious. That being said of the 60 hours I spent right now on this game I consider at least 30 hours well spent. The reason my review is a downvote is solely to give contrast and a critical view for people that just dont know.And just for reference here: I played Tropico 2 and Tropico 5 too, the core mechanics of the games do not change very much and most people like 4 over 5, so keep that in mind before making any decisions. Lets get to the game.Tropico 4 looks and feels like one big slightly politicized Advertisement for Vacation in Cuba back in the Days. This is not a bad thing. In fact this is propably the most important part of what makes this game so good in the eyes of many, and it held up for most of my playtime. If you are looking for a casual, fun game Tropico 4 cannot possibly dissappoint you. The Devs understood really well what makes this games experience so enjoyable on the surface and crafted just enough details and then alot of DLC's to hold up with that feeling.Sometimes the visuals look a little weird in terms of colors, because everything is so bright and colorful yet at the same time the buildings are so dull. In some instances it makes the game look slightly bad, especially when zoomed out, but its the smallest of problems really. The soundtrack is amazing, as are the general designs of menus et cetera.The game is a joy to see when you zoom in, and I would suggest that you do exactly that for most of the time. Observe, Decorate, build your private dictatorship island. Assassinate people and build roach patrol apartments for the poor. Import  Uranium and build big power plants and nuclear warheads. Do not play this like a strategy game, play this like a story/experience.To get why im saying this I must first give you a glimpse of how the mechanics in the game work. People live in shacks, people really only need 2 things to stay alive for long, those are food and healthcare. Also, people will arrive with immigration, so they are expendable. All of them are simulated on their own, you actually have as many people as the numbers say on the island. If they want to get to work, or want to satisfy any need, the people will leave their place and go to the spot where they can do that. Either they venture to a garage and get a car or they walk. Buildings that are connected to streets automatically supply the people with cars, cars VANISH on the end of one way. This means if you have a farm, people can drive TO the farm, but not AWAY from the farm. Also, you will get at least 500 people in some city after a certain amount of time. All of those people will drive a car if you supply them with one. Walking takes a ♥♥♥♥♥on of time, so its a good idea to build garages literally on every other corner.This is where the biggest problems of the game all stem from.Firstoff, you have NO direct control over traffic other than building roads and garages. All the roads will be single lane two way roads. You wont often find a midgame where you dont start seeing traffic problems. That goes especially for the goods being transported by truck drivers in literally any building that produces goods. The best advise I can give is to make long transport routes around the cities without many intersections for the goods (you need to be careful that those routes are the quickest though, otherwise the AI wont choose them) and hope for the best, you cant avoid traffic problems as a whole. Dealing with all of this makes the economy game incredibly frustrating. Especially because you also dont have control of what goods are being transported first, and therefore its very common to see income fluctiations.Luckily, this doesnt matter.""But how can it not matter?""Because the game is quite possibly the easiest strategy game known to mankind. I never failed and boy did I initially fail hard in some missions. Its really hard to completely get to game over, and its in my eyes impossible to build an entirely failing economy. Your island could have no ressources at all and you can still pull it off by importing and manifacturing.If you desperately need money, just build 2 Jewelry Factories, set gold imports on, set the import slider to unlimited, after a few months they will pay for themselves and after that you're gonna swim in cash. Same goes for Weapons. Same goes for Oil Products. Same goes for Furniture, to be honest same goes for everything more or less.Tourism is a nice steady income and forces you to actually pay attention to how you build things, but its infinitely worse than industry in every way. (Still a fun thing you should try out.)So the economy is not a challenge, what about the politics, do they matter?Yes, the policies you can enact can matter, and thats one of the strongest suits of the game. Often they are just nobrainers to either do or not do, but you actually can manipulate the game and the challenges you bring to yourself so that it feels >slightly< different everytime. Thats the most you can do.I played one Island completely communist, one Island completely capitalist, one Island focused on a Military dictatorship without builing any houses for the general population, just food and healthcare.And what were the biggest differences?In the Military dictatorship more people protested. Sometimes I got a rebel attack.The people also had more time to work. Thats about it. On Average I maybe had 40% Happyness (given a rich militaristic/intellectual upper class), thats 30% lower from my happiest island. Its almost like they dont care.And that while having no Liberty enhancing buildings or anything else, just food and healthcare. If you spend more than 30 hours you will quickly start to think that every island feels like the same, this is very obnoxious to notice if you play through the campaign. The only saving grace MIGHT be the DLC's or you as player going for some self sought vision.Which can always be fun, but in the end, no matter what you do, all your decisions feel like cosmetic overlay over the same broken♥♥♥♥♥island. Again, and again, and again.Thats the game.Theres nothing you could quickly change in the game to fix this entirely, and thats where all the DLC's come from.Your main objective hence should be to build a pretty island and fool around. Can you do that?A little bit, yes. The first island will look really good to you if you give it some patience and care, manually design districts and make everything look good with decorations. Then you go to the second island and guess what? It looks the same.The biggest differences always come through the islands themselves, but if they dont matter economically, and if they dont matter politically, how much of a game do I truly have?I honestly believe this is still a good buy for casual gamers, I honestly believe that you will have alot of fun on your first two or three islands and I honestly believe if you add the DLC it has decent numbers of content to play around with, but is it a good game?My Answer has to be no..And thats sad for me, since I love the series so much that I even listen to the soundtrack in my free time.But its just not a good strategy game, or even a good game. Its a polished but very confused sandbox dictatorship island that over long enough playtime eventually dissolves into a vast nothingness of senseless routine.And for that reason, I just cannot recommend it even though I love the series. I hope they can seriously improve the gameplay for the next one, because 5 didnt add or fix that much either afaik.(And sorry, but disasters are a complete joke. The game wouldve been better without them.)			",87,14,1,18,35,1,24

												I bought Tropico 4 as part of a bundle however despite many attempts and a number of wasted hours have never made it past the 3rd party DRM registration. As a last gasp attempt to get it sorted I have gone directly to their web page and reset two of my email accounts, which were apparentely created by the launcher, even tthough the launcher just whirls away and gives no response. I also created a third email account directly on their web page. However none of this resolved as the emails have never been received (before you ask, I have checked my spam folder).I am pretty tech savvy, working in the industry anyway and have never seen such a poor registration implementation and I include some of the bigger companies in that list as they can often be pretty poor as well. When you are unable to bypass the registration to play a game then you know you are facing an uphill struggle.So in summary I would rate Tropico 4 0/10 as I can't play it and can't bypass the registration (without implementing some hacks, which I refuse to do).The developer response was also pretty poor and never went beyond one question about the issue, which I had already answered in my original post (it would be nice if they actually read it before responding) and one statement to highlight the fact they state the game requires 3rd party DRM registration - I know that, that's why I am posting in their fourms asking for help with the registration!I have read quite a few similar stories in forums, etc.So a big thumbs down from me.

												This is a wonderful game with nice graphics, pretty cool depth and funny moments. Unfortunately its a killjoy when its crashing before it autosaves and resets every graphic detail to the lowest.I also believe the developer sabotages Tropico 4 so Tropico 5 boosts in sales otherwise i cannot explain why is so slow logging on (yes, the idiot kalypso company forces you to log with email and password each time you start the game) each time for like 3-4 minutes of blank and cursor only before the game menu appears.For the above i declare this game a SABOTAGE not worth buying.

												This game is like sim city but better. In Sim City you have to set up water systems for your people and make sure they thrive as a city and more b******t, whereas in this game you can let and your d******d citizens starve and then get invaded by the USSR. It's made by some studios that I have never heard of but it doesn't matter as their servers are still quicker than EA's. Also, it is a very mature game as it has racial stereotypes such as accents of the Chinese and getting awarded by the Middle East with camels. Its dialogue isn't cheesy, boring and s**t like other city simulators but actually says how we think it. The bakground music actually makes you feel happy eventhough you know that you are living in your parent's house basement, have no friends and cannot talk to girls without taking a dose of Xanex and pretending to be drunk but you only get drunk off of 2 sips of water.If you are procrastinating and cannot be bothered doing revision for your upcoming GCSE's, like taking long walks on the beach and/or have a large♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is where to go.

												This is the game I wish I'd been playing, for each hour I spent playing the various simcity games - It's this game that really hits the spot on city building genre. Perhaps it's the added elements of being a dictator?Whatever it may be, this game was brilliant, the campaign (and the add-ons) were fun, engaging and a little interesting too! just playing this actually made me contamplate geo-political issues etc, propbably because of the 'real world' quotes by famous dictators that made me realise that - While I was playing a game and crushing my populous into submission, for some people this was reality.Scary!Excellent game - If you're reading the reviews and sat on the fence if you should get this, Just buy it, It's one of the best games I've ever played.

												In a world of shady devs that sit down and figure out how to milk the most money or privacy invasion out of their customers, and then have their marketing team make it sound like they're doing you a favor, it's so refreshing to see a game like Tropico 4 call attention in its features list to their facebook integration. I can't wait to litter my facebook with updates on my progress in the game, and I guess the game will get free advertisement from that too, so it's really a win-win.I was already excited when I saw how the devs had kindly programmed the game to post to my social media, but when I booted the game and saw that I had to register an email address with them just to play this single-player game, I was overjoyed. I wouldn't want to accidentally start playing without receiving the ""free benefit of game news & updates"" in my email inbox, of course! If a paid DLC came out without my knowledge, I'd be heartbroken.Thank you, Kalypso Games, for this masterpiece of consumer-focused design. I bet you sleep real easy at night, knowing that everything you did was for your players and not pure greed so thinly disguised as a feature as to be blatantly insulting to our intelligence.

												This is a pretty good city builder game - if you played Tropico 3 it adds quite a bit. Both game mechanics, gameplay and graphics have been improved making game progression more enjoyable. The Steam Special Edition is a good bundle making it a good deal so if your like city builders and like how it make a bit of fun with government then go get it now.THE GOOD- Advisors and suggested buildings keep the information from being overwhelming.- Graphics looks great- Voice acting is good- Complex and rewarding strategy- Campaign is very, very long- Great sense of humorTHE BAD- Very similar to Tropico 3- Missions repeat the same general objectivesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			",109,25,0,18,59,0,23

												Have played each game in the Tropico series and would have to give this game a 9.2/10.Excellent small city building game based in the Caribbean, where you are a dictator and manage everything from your citizens everyday lives to a thriving industry based under both tourism with basic resource gathering and factory production to really roll out the profit. There is also considerble detail put into the game's detail and mechanics.The only real drawbacks I've found are your citizens are quite lazy so one must carefully plan out there city, less they begin running into traffic problems or workers not arriving at their jobs quickly enough.The ""Modern Times"" dlc addresses such an issue with subway systems, which as another note, the dlc truly enchances this game to an amazing and well balanced gameplay.

												This game is pretty Awesome, You get to choose an island that you will fully control, There are many leaders to choose from, Including The Infamous Fidel Castro, And the charsmatic Che Guevara, You have to balance every single aspect of your citizen's life, if poverty increases then there's a high chance of less voting for you, or sometimes a military coup, So be careful, Also it's fun playing with cheats, You get to interact with other major super powers like The USSR, The USA, The middle east (Although it's not technically a superpower) and other countries, There's a chance The US might invade you, and annex your island (Imperialists much?), I give this game a 9/10, Solid game, Had some bugs with it not gonna lie, everything else is solid as rock.

												A surprisingly good game!I was never a tremendous fan of Sim City, but i do like the genre.This is actually the second game lately i uninstall because it takes up waaay to much of my time. I've spent nearly 50 hours on it and i'm not even halfway done with the campaign.It does get a bit repetitive after 30 hours and you kind of want more buildings and more of everything really. But it's very addictive despite this. There is ofcourse DLC out there to fix this if you want too.I can highly reccomend Tropico if you have the time for it and like these kinds of games.I wonder if i will play Tropico5...?

												Have played each game in the Tropico series and would have to give this game a 9.2/10.Excellent small city building game based in the Caribbean, where you are a dictator and manage everything from your citizens everyday lives to a thriving industry based under both tourism with basic resource gathering and factory production to really roll out the profit. There is also considerble detail put into the game's detail and mechanics.The only real drawbacks I've found are your citizens are quite lazy so one must carefully plan out there city, less they begin running into traffic problems or workers not arriving at their jobs quickly enough.The ""Modern Times"" dlc addresses such an issue with subway systems, which as another note, the dlc truly enchances this game to an amazing and well balanced gameplay.

												The Tropico series is probably my favorite of the genre, and that's saying a lot.  It takes a while to get acclimated to the rules of running your own island (how rent/wages work, etc.), but is a lot of fun once you get a handle on what you're doing.  The campaign is fairly lengthy though I'm not a fan of the timed quests you'll enconter from time to tim.  Luckily, there's a sandbox mode that eliminates the pressures of the campaign.  Whether it be exports or tourism, your main goal is to keep your bank full whilst keeping your Tropicans happy.  Tropico 3 is almost identical in playstyle, so pick that up for cheaper to see if this is something you'd enjoy.

												Tropico 4 is actually quite pretty. You can watch as your presidente transforms an island from a wild, undeveloped garden into a bastion of industry and wealth. To this end you have an array of options when it comes to development. My recommendation? Play the tutorials – all of them!Nevertheless,if you take the time to learn the nuances of ruling, you'll find it's good to be presidente.			",295,35,4,33,15,4,45

												Much like a Caribbean vacation, you might not want to come home. The atmosphere above anything else really sells this game. The tropical feel and island music spices up what could be another city builder clone. In addition the sense of humor and satire prevalent throughout the game gives levity to what usually could be the typical boring ""Please build X"" communication from advisors. The campaign offers several different scenarios with a moderately engaging overarching story. However, by the last few missions, the typical routine of ""establish industry, save enough money, complete objectives"", starts to get tedious. In addition, the AI pathing can lead to some frustration in waiting endlessly for a structure to be constructed or a resource to be delivered. Despite this though, the game gets a recommendation for city builder fans who are looking for a more tropical change of scenery.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like Tropico 3, you will probably like Tropico 4 too, simply because it is essentially the same game with same things added. If you don't know T3, get it first.Besides little innovation compared to T3, there are two more things that are not that great in T4. First, the main campaign has only a couple of islands that are being reused in later missions. It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the second problem, the repetitive gameplay. Once you get the game, every mission feels a bit samey. This is improved with the DLC, but most missions can be solved in a similar way with a little bit of consideration of the random or not so random events.Recommend if you like Tropico 3.

												This game is fun to learn, by all means! It's an attractive, well-themed, humorously tongue-in-cheek city sim. The radio personalities, the music, and the graphics all contribute to an entertaining experience that will keep you riveted for easily ten maps.However, once you've got the basics down - about 15 missions into the campaign, if you've bothered - there's really no reward for you to keep playing. Every island follows the exact same pattern, every playthrough is identical. The campaign missions themselves are really pathetic, with a lame plot for each mission stretched over way too many pointless and time-wasting checkpoints. The auto-generated faction and foreign power tasks are predictable and lame as well, and utterly ignorable most of the time.The biggest challenge in the game comes from street planning - no joke. By the time your economy has matured, the layout of roads on your island is the only thing that can shut you down. If you have too many intersections, say goodbye to ever turning an export profit ever again. No one seems to be sure if these traffic management problems were entirely intentional, or an idea that snowballed into a monstrosity. I'm told the Modern Times expansion's ""Metro"" building helps with this, but truly, why bother?Tropico 4 offers no reward for mastery or sustained interest, but can offer about 20 hours worth of good clean fun. It's worth picking up on sale if nowhere else, but I'd steer clear of the DLC; save yourself a few bucks.			",114,34,0,26,24,1,44

												Very addicting game. The campaign is really fun considering how much stuff you have to overcome. The Tornados, the Earthquakes, the Tsunamis, their all fun to deal with. The only thing I don't like, and I would love to see, is something like the island becomes flooded, and you have to save people, or parts of the island become flooded... I also wish there was a workshop for this game, and I think people could create some crazy stuff!			",60,8,0,6,13,0,10

												This game is pretty Awesome, You get to choose an island that you will fully control, There are many leaders to choose from, Including The Infamous Fidel Castro, And the charsmatic Che Guevara, You have to balance every single aspect of your citizen's life, if poverty increases then there's a high chance of less voting for you, or sometimes a military coup, So be careful, Also it's fun playing with cheats, You get to interact with other major super powers like The USSR, The USA, The middle east (Although it's not technically a superpower) and other countries, There's a chance The US might invade you, and annex your island (Imperialists much?), I give this game a 9/10, Solid game, Had some bugs with it not gonna lie, everything else is solid as rock.

												Tropico 4 is actually quite pretty. You can watch as your presidente transforms an island from a wild, undeveloped garden into a bastion of industry and wealth. To this end you have an array of options when it comes to development. My recommendation? Play the tutorials – all of them!Nevertheless,if you take the time to learn the nuances of ruling, you'll find it's good to be presidente.			",295,35,4,33,15,4,45

												I received Tropico 4 for free from a Humble Bundle promotion.Tropico 4 is a city building game, a genre not usually my forte, but it's similar to other ones that I've played like Simcity and the Anno (Year #) series. You decide what buildings to make, and your people will semi-automatically fill their roles to become your laborers, craftsmen, police officers, priests, and whatever else you need on your Caribbean island during the Cold War years (1960 onward).Once you get the hang of things, you may begin to find that building a city from the ground up is extremely easy. Your people will demand certain amenities, but these demands are given to you on an almanac you may access at any time. Are people homeless? Build some apartments. Is a demand for healthcare, religion, or entertainment being unmet? Put down a clinic, church, or cabaret, and the problem will solve itself in time. If all needs are met, it's time to make some money with exports or tourism.Throughout the 20-mission campaign (in which you almost always start with the same set of basic buildings and end up populating a small fraction of the island), you are presented with different obstacles... but you can build your city nearly the exact same way every time. One island supposedly has a crime problem, but you'll only need to put down a police station earlier than you otherwise might. One island has a rebel problem, so you'll need more military buildings earlier. The problems are thrown at you one island at a time, and only a small tweak is needed to keep things running smoothly.Despite the wide variety of buildings, many of them either have little or identical effects. Farms growing cash crops, mines, industries, and tourism all make you money behind the scenes. All you need to do is analyze what your available assets are, and place buildings for the one that'll get the most return on investment. Your citizens handle the nitty-gritty of transporting and exporting the goods.There's a wide swath of entertainment buildings, but unless you are going for tourism or trying to build a giant, deliriously happy island, most of them are not useful. Cabarets provide good entertainment for all Tropican citizens, and don't require electricity. Unless you are swimming in money (and you will be after a while), there's no need for pubs, restaurants, casinos, or roller coasters.Your island has different factions like Communists or Capitalists whom you must please if you want them to vote for you in the periodic elections, but it's fairly easy to keep all of them happy. Even if you are in danger of losing an election, there are many ways to steal it at the last second, like signing edicts that people like, upping everyone's pay, bribing faction leaders, or just rigging the election. The same goes for foreign powers. In all my time playing so far, I've gotten China annoyed enough to embargo me once. That's all.I'm going to say that I don't recommend this game, but with the stipulation that if you like city building games with an easygoing pace and low level of difficulty, you may like this anyway. If you're new to city building games or gaming in general, it might be a good starting point before tackling something less forgiving. But if you're looking for a challenge, look elsewhere.

												Ok. So maybe in Tropico my priorities were a bit one sided and may have caused a small uprising. But so what? That's the absolute glory of this amazing city builder. You do one thing to try and impress one person and then suddenly all of your miner's go on strike. Overall, this game is a brilliantly beautiful city builder andif you wan to get your teeth into something before moving on to the sequel, Tropico 5, then this is the game for you.

Surprisingly, it's a really rather good city-builder*disclaimer, long and detailed review, skip to bottom for final verdictI got Tropico 4 in a humble bundle, kind've only wanting the other games in the bundle. So there it sat in my vast Steam library, not really doing anything. And then, my friend told me about a really good city-builder that he had been playing. I thought, ""oh Simcity, right?"" Wrong. He was talking about Tropico, (Tropico 5 however). At this time, I had forgotten that I even had it. So, when I looked it up on the steam store, I realised that I already had it. So, I gave it a shot. And I was quite presently surprised! So, here is a list explaining the good and bad elements of Tropico 4 and there reasons.Pros+Each little person has their own profile;What was one of the elements that made Tropico stand out was the ability to click on every little person walking around, doing there daily routine. Once you clicked on them, a profile of the character came up, explaining their age, wellbeing, faction, name, where they work and where they live. It would also make the camera follow that person. Sometimes, I would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on end.+In the population, there are structured families;A little more of a unnecessary part of the game, (but undoubtedly cool) was the structured families. Sometimes when checking people's profiles, you may find a group of people with the same last name. At first, I thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in. But then, I executed a guy, and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged. Confused, I looked at the effects of executing someone, and it said; ""victim's family will become enraged"" and thats when I realised, there was families, which is really cool!+A system where technology evolves with time;Much like Civilization V (which is an utterly fantastic strategy game), technology would advance as time goes on. This means, that I might start out with some crappy tenements, but when I research more stuff, I could have super high-tec shopping malls. Nuff said.+The ability of extreme POWER;In this game, you have the power of anything and everything on the island, (apart from the rebels, which we will get to later). None of the decisions will be made for you, you have to make them. There are recomendations for what to build, but I mostly found myself ignoring them, as sometimes they can screw you over.+Rebels;The rebels system in this game is rather good. It's simple, when someone becomes too unhappy with the island, they will become a rebel. Rebels can and will screw you over. They will start fires, attack buildings and people and generally become out of control.+Disasters;Perhaps copying other citybuilders, this game has disasters. Dont worry though, you won't be having meteors or aliens or...dinosaurs *cough*Simcity*cough*. Just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes. And it won't just be mildly annoying either, it will seriously screw you over. Once, when I built my city next to a volcano, thinking it would look pretty cool, lets just say it wasn't cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and I went financialy in debt.So, thats the list of things which I think are pretty cool in this game. Now, we will talk about the cons.Cons-Limited time;The thing I can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game, even in sandbox mode! Sure it is a while, but one time, I built a really great city...and then I couldn't play anymore because my ""mandate had run out"", and that was on maximum time. Sure, it adds realism, but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is. This is where Just Cause 2 shined, now you might be thinking, ""what the devil, what on Earth has that got ot do with Tropico?!"" well, my friend; nothing. I was just bringing it up. Anyways, the reason Just Cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic. Tropico should get some inspiration off that.-Lack of help;One of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with ""build a city"". This is a large downside, as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things. Alot of the time, I found myself looking at my amount of money, going down by the thousands, completely confused why.-Graphics;Now, I would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem, especially considering it's a citybuilder. But the graphics are a little lacking.Final VerdictSo, we are down to the final verdict, and, if you couldn't already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on, I most certainly recomend Tropico 4! Even though it has flaws, I can still say this is a great, solid citybuilder. Thank you for taking some time to read this!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A pretty good concept and I liked the graphics, but the game just got a little repetitive and I didn't feel like there was a natural progression that introduced new concepts at the right intervals to keep the game progressing. Not enough new things happened.As a side note, when tornadoes struck it was super annoying. I couldn't find away to turn them off, but you had to sit there and wait for it to finish before you did anything. Also, why do they have to make the female dictators say stupid, sexist crap? All of the females say the same things, which is stuff about getting their nails done or being attractive. I'm guessing zero women helped in the development of this game, but come on, dudes.

												I received Tropico 4 for free from a Humble Bundle promotion.Tropico 4 is a city building game, a genre not usually my forte, but it's similar to other ones that I've played like Simcity and the Anno (Year #) series. You decide what buildings to make, and your people will semi-automatically fill their roles to become your laborers, craftsmen, police officers, priests, and whatever else you need on your Caribbean island during the Cold War years (1960 onward).Once you get the hang of things, you may begin to find that building a city from the ground up is extremely easy. Your people will demand certain amenities, but these demands are given to you on an almanac you may access at any time. Are people homeless? Build some apartments. Is a demand for healthcare, religion, or entertainment being unmet? Put down a clinic, church, or cabaret, and the problem will solve itself in time. If all needs are met, it's time to make some money with exports or tourism.Throughout the 20-mission campaign (in which you almost always start with the same set of basic buildings and end up populating a small fraction of the island), you are presented with different obstacles... but you can build your city nearly the exact same way every time. One island supposedly has a crime problem, but you'll only need to put down a police station earlier than you otherwise might. One island has a rebel problem, so you'll need more military buildings earlier. The problems are thrown at you one island at a time, and only a small tweak is needed to keep things running smoothly.Despite the wide variety of buildings, many of them either have little or identical effects. Farms growing cash crops, mines, industries, and tourism all make you money behind the scenes. All you need to do is analyze what your available assets are, and place buildings for the one that'll get the most return on investment. Your citizens handle the nitty-gritty of transporting and exporting the goods.There's a wide swath of entertainment buildings, but unless you are going for tourism or trying to build a giant, deliriously happy island, most of them are not useful. Cabarets provide good entertainment for all Tropican citizens, and don't require electricity. Unless you are swimming in money (and you will be after a while), there's no need for pubs, restaurants, casinos, or roller coasters.Your island has different factions like Communists or Capitalists whom you must please if you want them to vote for you in the periodic elections, but it's fairly easy to keep all of them happy. Even if you are in danger of losing an election, there are many ways to steal it at the last second, like signing edicts that people like, upping everyone's pay, bribing faction leaders, or just rigging the election. The same goes for foreign powers. In all my time playing so far, I've gotten China annoyed enough to embargo me once. That's all.I'm going to say that I don't recommend this game, but with the stipulation that if you like city building games with an easygoing pace and low level of difficulty, you may like this anyway. If you're new to city building games or gaming in general, it might be a good starting point before tackling something less forgiving. But if you're looking for a challenge, look elsewhere.

												Pretty interesting, more so than one of the Sim City's I played at the very least. Want to build your own little Communist paradise, an oppresssive militarist government, or a joyful little hub of capitalism & consumerism; it's all there.There are also a small host of sterotypical characters which represent every faction/interest group. Besides constantly wanting to decapitate Sunny Flowers, the enviromental activist, they're all either tolerable or interesting.And I do have a pretty good time gunning down religious rebels every now & then who are angry since I won't build churches or have stupid bans on things like contraception. I also quite enjoy tossing devoutly religious and capitalist people into my labor camps. :DLong live El Presidente, Comrade Winston!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tropico is a city building game along the lines of Simcity.  Although a great deal of attention has been paid to creating depth for the game, it suffers from one huge deficit that limits long term playability.  It lacks a way to flatten (or alter) terrain, leaving the most interesting parts of the map unusable.  Really, what's the point of building a huge statue if you can't place it at the top of a cliff, or up on the side of a mountain where everyone can see it?  On one Kalypso forum,  they claimed that this 'feature' was included by design to make the game more challenging.  If so, this was a bad decision.  This same approach to terrain makes road placement difficult and imprecise.  Bottom line : maybe they fixed this in version 5, but I'm not spending the money to find out.			",2,0,0,1,5,0,6

												Tropico 4 is definitely a game to pick up if you like management of cities and a whole banana republic island. You are El Presidente and your people need you to lead them into prosperity... or annilation. If you haven't played any of the Tropico games I suggest this over Tropico 3. But if you have already played Tropico 3, you shouldn't really need to worry about this, it feels more like this should have been an expansion or a patch for Tropico 3. Having said that, it's not a bad game in the least. Sim City fans will enjoy it, but maybe not hardcore fans as you aren't zoning your residential and industry areas but it's certainly nothing like Sim City Societies, and you aren't managing populations of thousands, you are managing hundreds of individuals of whom you can watch their daily routine, and you can hire and fire those individual people. Tropico 4 is a great simulation game. 9/10			",495,124,15,81,68,6,88

												I became a dictator of a small third world country. Raised a great metropolis, built a giant economy, raised gaint catheadrals to show our love for God, made a nuclear program, had a president shot in the face, and allowed gay marrige... then promply got tied to a stake and burned alive by a few religious fanatics. I then narrowly escaped, and got sucked into a spaceship, learned the ways of the predators from that movie predator, retrieved a lightsaber, and escaped to the White House. Promptly cutting off the hand of George W Bush and telling him I was his father and escaping on a boat. Finnishing off by shooting a CIA assassin in the back and pushing him into the water so he loses his memory. Then I came home and played Tropico 4: Steam Special Edition. It was pretty good.

												If you like heavily scenario-based sim city type games then this is a good one. Keep in mind though that this game differs from things like sim city not only in the heavy emphasis on scenario objectives, but also you're in a command economy dictatorship. You don't simply ""zone"" a residential area, you command your peon followers to build an apartment building exactly where you want it, and if they don't like that then they're perfectly free to get shot in the head for their traitorous discontent.One of the great things about this game is the political system which allows you to give speeches that pay lipservice to various things while taking absolutely no actions to further them. For example, praise the spirit of communism while you do exactly the opposite of what the communist faction wants.... it'll still keep them happier for longer than if you didn't. Got annoying peolpe voting against you? Just have them shot or get into an ""accident"", though these kinds of operations will cost you money.Before you buy Tropico 5, I'd recommend getting Tropico 4 on sale to try it out.Only real problem with the game, and its more of an annoyance than anyting, is the extra DRM: they make you create an account on the publisher's servers just to launch the game.

												Picked this game up for free expecting it to be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Installed it after having it sit in my library for a few months and booted it up.  Gameplay 	The gameplay is simple but some things can be confusing unless you do the tutorials.  (Though if you've played city management games it probably won't be too hard).  There's not alot of customization to the buildings and alot are copy/past  with only a few providing alternate models.  The maps are also very uneven and unless there's some world editor I'm missing, a good portion of the map is virtually unusable. With the maps becoming pretty small and after a few hours of playing, the majority of usable space will be taken up.  Some maps don't even have all of the mining resources and thus some foreign deals are unable to be done.    This game is also stupidly easy, I usually suck at city builders yet I was raking in money with everyone in the world and all of my citizens all perfectly happy with me.  Any conflicts or disasters are stupidly easy to overcome and provide no challenge at all.  Once had a tornado run straight through the thickest part of my city and I lost a farm, garage, and church, which took around 3 seconds to fix.  Money can start off slow but eventually if you just spam out farms w/ tobacco and then cigar plants and make 300k per export.  There's variety with paths you can take your goverment but I don't feel as if this gives it along playtime.  Speaking of the playtime the game is really fun at first but quickly gets old and boring.  Going down different government choices can lead to different experiences but those will get old soon along with your original playthrough.   Campaign	The campaign takes 30mins to complete with you just having to win the election through various means.  Even though I was in debt, hated by commies, ecos, religious, and loyalists, I still won majority vote without ANY manipulation of the election.  You can continue the story after that but it's just a repeat. Sound	Voice acting is a bit dull (and racial/politcal stereotyped really hard) but at least the music is kickass.  I could listen to the relaxing music for hours and it really compliments the mood that the game is trying to have.   Graphics	Graphics look pretty nice for being a bit old and enjoyable. Overall This game is fairly simple and lacking of too much content but it's worth a few hours of your time if the price is on sale.  It's a nice game to relax with and enjoy.  Wouldn't recommend to people that play alot of city builders due to the oversimplistic and easier mechanics compared to other games in the genre such as Skylines.			",69,8,1,10,10,1,5

I think I liked the music better in Tropico3 - this one I just turned it off, but that's just personal taste.  The game plays very leisurely after you figure out a good strategy.

												Pros:- Excellent humor/satire. If you like overexaggerated. stereotype humor- or Junot Diaz - this is for you. - Cohesive art direction. (As opposed to, say, T5)- Easy enough that you don't have to micro-manage. Important because I can never built a fully functional city in Sim City, but I've done it 32 times here.- Multiple ways to earn cash, the grease of dictatorship.- Interesting campaign storyline + mission limitations. - Plenty of diabolical dictator things to do - built a city full of crime and exploit the criminals in labor camps. It's not gonna get much into your Swiss Bank Account, but BOY is it fun.Cons:- Every stage you restart building a mostly empty island for the main campaigns. Super repetitive.- Once you know how the game works, the campaigns can be unchallenging.- It's got nothing to offer for someone looking for a detailed city builder. - There's only really one 'true' way to play the game - build a paradise island with an amazing economy and keep everyone happy. Sure, you can build a giant army and keep everyone in prison and labor camps like a true dictator - but since all the missions and goals ends with people being happy, at the end of the day you'll still revert to the default island angelico gameplay. That's not to say it isn't fun to try though...Side note:Get the Modern Times DLC, if nothing else. The voice acting and the campaign is weaker than the main game, but it adds a lot to the game if you already like it.			",30,22,0,22,13,0,9

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it just seems like they should adjust their price tag accordingly. I'd say this game and all of it's DLC is worth no more than 10 dollars. At it's current price (around 70+ dollars) I can't recommend this game, because it's just a rip off.			",139,3,2,15,22,0,54

												I love the game, but my issue is in the distribution. Tropico 4 is available for both PC and Mac, but if you purchase on Steam, you are provided with only the PC version. Unlike virtually every other game on Steam, you are not given access to both PC and Mac versions.The fact i have to boot into windows to play this when an osx version is available has turned me off the tropico franchise. Despite contacting ""support"" several weeks ago, they have not gotten back to me.			",359,77,8,63,69,5,80

												Sorry but Modern Times killed Tropico for me.  I should have gone for Tropico 3. but instead I stupidly bought 5 and when i discovered how dumbed down it had become, thought 4 would be better.  Far too easy and very disappointing as I had not played since 1, which was a delight.			",13,6,0,3,14,0,1

												To say that I became lightly obsessed with Tropico 4 is an understatement. It does offer massive improvements over the previous releases in the franchise, and it does offer all kinds of various play modes and routes you can take. As a city builder, it's one of the most fun games I've ever played. It is a time sink, it does suck up many hours of your life that you'll never get back. However, you're having fun the whole time so it's not a waste of that time, either. I've nearly finished the main campaign, and I've obviously played a good bit of the other options to rack up my game time as it is, and I don't really have any plans of stopping until I play as much of the game as possible. It's fun, sarcastic, satirical, critical, all the things you would expect from something as tongue-in-cheek as the series presents itself. You are guaranteed to have fun if you're a fan of the genre. However, Tropico 4 is not free of issues, and denying the glaring issues would make me a fan to an uncomfortable level. Even for the time it was released, the visuals aren't that great. Then again, with this type of game, the visuals aren't exactly why you're playing. The character designs are quite funny, the dialog and accents are giggle-worthy, and the jokes do get a little bit much after awhile. The largest problem I have with it is the natural disasters. After awhile, they start to lag horribly, in particular, in my case, the oil tanker spills tend to lock up the game and will often unfreeze the game themselves after a somewhat extended period of time (1-2 minutes), or I will have to completely close the game and start whatever campaign mission I'm on over altogether. Even with this issue, it's done little to detract from my enjoyment of it. Another somewhat negative aspect of the game is the soundtrack. It's great for awhile, but after that while, it tends to grate on your nerves a good bit because it's the same 3-4 songs played over and over. It's not that I expected them to have an entirely fresh soundtrack for the game, but a little more variety would've been nice. Luckily you can turn the music off and put your own on in the background and that will take care of that minor complaint. The good parts are many, and again, you WILL enjoy yourself if you enjoy city builders. Ultimately, all the decisions are left up to you, but as the campaign itself progresses, you will have more challenging obstacles to overcome (as is expected.) My suggestion would be to get this on sale, but not to overlook it. For what it is, it's great, and I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to be a well-liked and strong dictator. Now I want to buy my own island. Overall, 7.5/10.			",2910,1137,96,354,354,29,474

												I quite enjoyed the game at first, but cannot recommend it due to the lack of content and how easy it is.Once you have built one mega island with every building on it, the only thing that changes about new islands is handicaps and mission events; the game was just too simple for me to enjoy like I enjoy most economy management games.It's a shame, because the game does do some interesting things with the political side of running a city which other games shy away from, and the artwork for the characters is amazing.It also has some features which may be leftovers from previous games or something, in that you can select people in your game individually and see info on them as well as various options (mostly involving kidnapping or killing them) similar to dwarf fortress.I never one needed to actually use this system as, other than mission NPC's, all my people loved me too much.I completed most of the story missions and tried out some free form games, all my cities quickly reached 80% happyness in all catagories, and my money was always in the hundred thousands. It wasn't particularly challenging once I could afford to quickbuild (it's a button the instantly builds a structure for cash without waiting for a building crew, which shouldn't be in the game IMO) any buildings I wanted and I never once lost an island.All in all, it's a neat little game that lacks any real challenge and isn't quite deep enough on the economy side to keep me interested past the first few islands.

												Tropico has had so many installments and seperate DLC that the whole series has become a joke.Tropico 4 is better than Tropico 5 in my opinion, because it's more focused in it's original goal.  Tropico by nature isn't supposed to be a city builder, it's supposed to be a Political game, in other words it's a game where you literally make your own nation.  T4 gives you much more control and fine tuning to do these things.Sure, T5 looks better, and it's easier to place buildings in perfect placement,  but it fails at it's core concept.I don't explicitly reccomend either game, but if I had to reccomend one, it'd be T4.  It's cheaper, it's more true to the core concept of the series, and it doesn't have an astronomical amount of terrible nickle and diming DLC tacked onto it like T5 does.			",191,11,3,19,40,2,51

												It started out okay and seemed like a lot of fun. The problem becomes when you have to start micromanaging every single aspect of the game. It seems buggy to me that you can be making $100k profits in one year, then the next you suddenly run negative with no change or spending. Without being able to drill down deeper it becomes impossible to micromanage to the level you need. Plus it gets really, really repetitive. I have build more apartments with no rent than I have people, yet still have f***ing shacks everywhere. Not worth the frustration.			",77,4,0,25,4,0,14

												Tropico has had so many installments and seperate DLC that the whole series has become a joke.Tropico 4 is better than Tropico 5 in my opinion, because it's more focused in it's original goal.  Tropico by nature isn't supposed to be a city builder, it's supposed to be a Political game, in other words it's a game where you literally make your own nation.  T4 gives you much more control and fine tuning to do these things.Sure, T5 looks better, and it's easier to place buildings in perfect placement,  but it fails at it's core concept.I don't explicitly reccomend either game, but if I had to reccomend one, it'd be T4.  It's cheaper, it's more true to the core concept of the series, and it doesn't have an astronomical amount of terrible nickle and diming DLC tacked onto it like T5 does.			",191,11,3,19,40,2,51

												It gets boring rather quickly. Personally, for this type of game, Age of Empires Conquerers is an all-time favorite. I find it to have much more action and you make progress considerably faster, depending on how you play it. It is also a lot more interacting with its players. It may be a little more focused on the military aspect of building a society but it is still a more entertaining game by far in my opinion.			",9,0,0,0,1,0,0

												I decided to revisit Tropico in the form of Tropico 4. I played the original as a kid, and skipped Tropico 2 and 3. Ultimately, Tropico 4 seemed promising at first, but I quickly reached a certain point where it started to feel repetitive and too easy. I guess the crux of it is that if you plan your first steps correctly, you can make your profits grow exponentially such that by late game you have more money than you know what to do with. That means that by the the time you progress to a more developed island, the gameplay has gotten pretty boring. A lot of the main story games involve large sum payments, which just feels like a waiting game. Based on my experience, it has no replay value for me and I don't see myself playing this version again. I wish they had added a few more key aspects to the game rather than just updating the art, engine, and adding some more buildings. But it isn't completely terrible, so while I'm not recommending it, I'm not condemning it either. If you find it on sale for a few dollars, it might be worth giving it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has double DRM: You have to launch it through Steam and then register a Kalypso account to begin playing. That's a pretty clumsy/greedy grab at your customer base.This was my first, and last, Kalypso game.			",312,93,6,44,27,4,20

												The only Tropico I've had the pleasure to play, This is a simple city builder; you don't need to manage detailed finances like the old Sim Citys, or zone sections off of the land or deal much with traffic. Just simply pick a building, find a spot, and plunk it down. The meat and potatos is in the export based economy. Find resources to utilize, and ""design"" an efficient economy that keeps goods moving from the initial point, to the docks and out of the country. Important to a lesser extent are the tourism and service industries. Look for a nice part of the Island, and turn it into a kitschy tourist district. You can have them mingle with local Tropicans, or keep them away. Other things to deal with: keeping the various factions happy, and keeping the foreign powers happy. Set in the 1960s, it behooves you to keep the US and USSR content in relations. Otherwise an implied invasion force ends the game. You can also lose the game by losing elections. Keep the people happy, and they'll vote for you. You can be Presidente for life. That is of course if you allow elections in the first place.There's lots of humor to this, and it doesn't take itself seriously. The soundtrack is great, especially if you've listened to the Salsa and Merengue. The graphics and art is beautiful, yet it can look like a slum if you want/cause it to. In the end, this game is perfect if you want to get your city building fix in, it doesn't require much time, and the learning curve is simple.Penultimo beckons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
