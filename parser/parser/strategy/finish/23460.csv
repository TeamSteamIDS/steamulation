												One of my first Steam buys, and money well-spent-- of course, I got it on sale.  ;-)I don't think it's going to replace some of the great point-and-click classics, but it's a nice little game in its own right and is worth a look.It features nice 3D graphics (especially for its time), very good voice acting (eveything is voiced), quite humorous, and a good story.  There are three playable characters: Ceville (the sniveling deposed ruler), Ambrosious the (hilariously) pompous knight, and Lilly (a cute little girl who has great banter with Ceville).  Sometimes you play multiple characters simultaneously, and there are points where you have to do one thing as one character, switch to another, and complete a task.Note that there are a few clearly-identifiable timed elements (a clock will tick) where you have to do something within, say, 10 seconds.  There are no failures that require a re-load, and you can save any time.  You can double-click to skip run animations, and you can hold the spacebar to reveal hidden objects.Most of the puzzles are quite fair and reasonable-- there were a few I had to get help with...which IMO is a good thing.  Many of the puzzles are combining inventory items in a (usually) intuitive way...and using dialog trees to open up new paths.Anyway, give it a try next time it's on sale!			",211,407,9,49,28,3,48

												It was very hard for me to put a positive review. No, don't think that the game isn't nice. The game is really awesome. There's an excellent storyline, funny dialogues (and monologues), difficult riddles, original characters, and awesome cutscenes. So, you're starting thinking why I said that it was hard for me to put a positive review? Because of the countless crashes! The game crashed so many times, that I seriously thought of unistalling it. The constant crashes were making it unplayable. Anyway, I managed to finish the game and if it wasn't for the crashes, I would give a 10/10. But now, I can hardly give a 6/10. Please, understand that, even though I love this game, all these crashes made me really frustrated.			",374,144,15,33,42,8,47

												A fun enough game, awesome if you can get it on special. It's not an exceptionally long game, which I guess can be both a pro and a con depending on how you find the game. For the most part I found it enjoyable. A lot of the humour was pretty cheesy, but they're well done and there's bound to be a few in there to make you laugh. To progress in the game, you have to play a few nasty pranks of some of the other characters which is always amusing. I was able to figure out most of the game myself, but thankfully there was a few good walkthroughs online for when I got really stuck. I guess my mind wasn't twisted enough to solve all the puzzles =P I recomend that you save fairly often though. The game was a bit buggy and it froze a few times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

AUDIOStockVISUALCheesyDIFFICULTYAverageVIBESillyCRAVINGCheesyON SALEOccasionalPROS: Voice-acting is cute, and the cast is likeable. Characters are all stylized like caricatures, making them interesting and unique. Story is done largely from the eyes of the bad guy, a role that is interesting to watch be explored. Interface is familiar and easy to pick up quickly.CONS: Glitchy and has a tendency to crash. the 3D graphics don't look very good. Puzzles are far too easy. Dialogue is one-note and can often be pointless. Cringe-factor is present with some of the jokes.WORTH: This game has that cheap polish to it that's endearing, but not worth much of your cash. Add it to your wishlist to watch out for a sale if you're a point & click fan and don't break the bank for it.OVERALL: Ceville is unspectacular for a point n' click adventure but it's entertaining enough for a few hours of your time. If you're a fan of the genre, it's a quirky little addition to your collection.SCORE:6/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon ",309,150,6,54,38,3,41

												One of the most underrated, unkown absolute PEARLS of point-and-click adventure games. The game design and universe is creative, colorful and the universe is set in a magical medieval time. The music and characters are appealing and varied, and even though you're (mostly) playing as a malevolent king, you will cry not from sadness, but from laughter.I played this several years ago, and I've been looking for it ever since. I finally found it when Ceville was on sale previously this year.Highly recommended.			",94,11,1,9,8,1,15

												Ceville has a true honor in my library, as it is one of very few adventure games I've actually taken the time to complete.  Ceville has great graphics considering what it is, supports my resolution, has a great sense of humor, and the length of the story felt just right. I did occasionally have to google for help, but that is part of adventure games anyways if you ask me. This game is fun if you are into adventure games, and at its current price tag will deffinately be worth adding to your collection. ~Seth			",913,138,59,85,56,7,110

												Very fun, but very buggy. Whenever I was stuck, I would wonder if something was bugged, or if I was just being stupid. Always turned out I was just being stupid. T.T If you're willing to overlook the bugs though, the protagonist's charm easily turns this game into a precious little gem.			",128,67,2,25,14,1,27

												The game is a bit glitchy, and prone to occassional random freezing/crashing. The puzzles generally run a bit more on the easy side than most games in the genre, and the dialogue, while occassionally humorous, tends to more often feel repetitive and useless. And, the graphics may or may not appeal to you depending on your point of view. That said, while these are highly notable cons, there is something endearing about the characters in the game and the overall puzzle that is being solved. That is, the characters are somehow likable, the story engaging, and the puzzles still generally feel fun, and, on the bright side, their solutions actually mostly make intuitive sense. The inventory can get a bit overloaded at times, leading to a bit of guessing being needed at times, but that's not exactly uncommon for such games. Overall, it's definitely not one of the best in the genre, but it is worth a good several hours of playing time.			",1002,431,36,135,117,11,185

												One of the point & click games I remember the most fondly from my younger days. In fact it's one of my favorite point & click games from the 2000's, along with Jolly Rover, Ankh, Vooju Island, Machinarium and the classic Runaway 2.I still need to replay this so I won't get into specifics, but I'll just mention that unlike most P&C's I can't remember being frustrated by the gameplay or annoying sequences, so it's a big plus. It also had me laughing a lot at its main character, halfway between Iznogoud and Gru. (Iznogru?) The visuals weren't exceptional, but as long as you have fun with them it's okay, especially if the animations are cartoonish enough (as they are here). The only problem I've had in my Steam copy is with video not playing (I can only hear the audio), but I'm confident there's a fix around here for that.Well worth a try.

												Ceville is a funny, classic point&click game with medium difficulty. The graphics is fine, the dialogs are really funny.Unfortunatelly I experienced some technical issues. The game craches often, fortunatelly it has an automatic save system, it saves in every five minutes, so you dont have to play from the beginning, if you forgot to save. And I don't no why but I did not see some cutscenes. I heard the voices but the screen was black. I searched on the internet and it is a common issue, but did not find solution.I still recommend this game because if you did like classic Lucasarts adventures like DOTT, Monkey Islands, Sam and Max, you will like this one too.

Humour is okay, the story is okay, the gameplay is okay, so is voice acting, graphics etc... and yet for some reason it's just very boring after a short while. Maybe adventure games fans will enjoy it more than I did, but I would not recommend Ceville to anyone because it simply can't hold one's interest.			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

Even though I feel the game is aimed more at a younger audience, I still enjoyed it. Also the game design visuals and colors were pleasing.

												""Ceville"" is a classic Point & Click adventure, a comedy that follows the adventures of Ceville, former tyrant of a fantasy kingdom, now dethroned and searching for revenge, and a way to recover his throne. The main appeal of the story is the main character: this time, you control the villain, and it's a blast: Ceville is a really fun character, in his comical way. Forget about complex antagonists, with vague moral compasses and troubled backgrounds, because Ceville is just the epitome of the classic ""Bad Guy"". He twirls his mustache, hates good actions, is always rubbing his hands together and machinations perfidious plans, and he's deeply amused by other people's misfortune. If you're used to the good ol' adventure games, you'll feel right at home in this game. Lots of witty lines of dialog, funny characters and tons of puzzles, around a game that doesn't feel too long or too short. The game isn't very hard, most of the puzzles can be solved through logic, and you can press ""SPACE"" to see every interactive element in the screen, so ""pixel hunting"" isn't even a factor. Now, for the cons, the biggest one: Game crashes a lot. At least, it did for me. During the second Act, when you get access to the Map, every time I pulled it out, there was a chance the game would crash to desktop, or just freeze, which made that part very annoying. There's no way to fix or avoid it, so if you're unlucky, all you can do is to be patient and load the game again every time it happens. It's quite telling that in a game where you can't die, the game auto-saves every 5 minutes, rotating through 10 different files.Other than that, while the writing is good, sometimes the humor relies on references too much. And the ending is really abrupt. But other than that, I recommend it to any fans of the adventure genre, just be warned about the technical issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It maybe crashed once but that was likely my fault because I alt+tabbed.

												Summary: Ceville is a very nice adventure game with a good sense of humor, but is also one of the buggiest games I've played on Steam.OK, so Ceville is a very typical adventure game, inspired by Monkey Island and various other classic series. It is funny, traditional, and quite challenging in some parts.You play mainly as a deposed king trying to regain his throne and his little assistant Lilly. The two travel through a very typical fantasy world and solve puzzles to advance the story. It's all quite charming. Some of the puzzles are very obtuse and while many of the solutions are satisfying, some left me saying, ""Oh...that was....the solution?""This game froze up constantly on Windows 7. It usually freezes up when traveling between map locations during the lengthy second chapter. Fortunately, the game autosaves every five minutes and F5 quicksaves. I got used to saving before traveling.  If you like typical adventure games, this one is a good one and should be played by anyone. Just get used to saving often. :)			",115,51,6,19,11,0,15
