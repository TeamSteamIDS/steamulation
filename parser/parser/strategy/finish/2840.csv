												So my review will probably end up somewhere and no one will ever read it but here I go nevertheless.I played this game when it came or some time after it was in a gaming magazine as an extra. It's not that easy as a kid but if you actually know what you are doing it's not that hard. The story isn't the best but it's not that bad either.There are 6 races, with 5 of them you can trade and build space stations in their systems. The beginning can be a bit slow but as soon as you have yor own station, which you can get after about an hour if you sell the shield you get, it gets quite easy. There are some stations which are just flat out better than others but you can either figure that out yourself or just google it. If you want to explore a bit you can, just fly wherever you want, leave some money in you stations and some transporters and when you come back you will have more money then you left.Some tips you should listen to:get the S.E.T.A upgrade  it makes the game much more enjoyable.and get the docking computer from the paranids.if you have questions just leave them here i'll respond to them.

												This game is a bit difficult to start out as the tutorial was... well useless and the manual wasn't really as helpful as it could be. Once you get into the game though it becomes more interesting as you can set up your own production plants and start getting into the finer aspects of trading. If you like trading games this is a good one to get as there is a lot of product to play around with. The combat system is a bit lacking as it's hard to destroy enemies with lasers in the beginning and the enemy AI gets really suicidal taking you with them as they crash into you. Still aside from the occasional nonsense the game itself is unique and can be very fun if your willing to learn how to play the game.			",102,44,0,71,16,0,15

												This game is exactly like the Elite game: Frontier - Elite II. But more better and simplier. The only thing is if you got games like X2 and X3 then you may not adapt to the controls and how to manage those open-ended games. Start with this game and try it! If you get stuck or think you need more cash in-game, look into the Egosoft site. And use the HEX editor tool in your x-btf saves. Read more info in Egosoft or the Cheat sites.The only thing that this game got, compared to the newer X-Series games is the afterburner turbo boost and the SETA Boost Extension that isn't featured in the newer series. I have to warn you if you play X2 The Threat onwards you maybe lost on how to interact, trade and fight -- as it is a steep learning curve. So start with X - Beyond the Frontier and maybe have a glance on my guides and video tutorials if you are interested.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a slow game. 2 hours in you're still in the tutorial. The space physics feel like driving a submarine. It from from 1999 and looks like it and many corners feel like it.But there is so much character, style and love put into this, and so much of the design was made specifically because it would make a better game.If you're a patient person who can enjoy the little things, this game is for you.

												X Beyond The Frontier is the first of the X series and it's funny how little has changed since this incarnation and all the way to Albion Prelude. Some things are sorely missing, such as the ability to change ships but the core of the game back then was much the same.While the technology has gone leaps and bounds since this game was released, the quality of the graphics has exploded and features that were unthinkable back in those days have been added the core of the game, the essence of what an X game is, remains much the same to this day.You are a pilot on a experimental spaceship in a universe, as the game starts events unfold that leave you stranded in alien space with no way home. And that's about all the direction you will get from this game. There is a plot hiding somewhere and occasionally you will come across bits and pieces of it but following it is entirely optional and most players will probably choose to ignore it for the majority of the game.The core of the game is, quite simply, trading, fighting and exploring. You travel around the universe finding new systems, new enemies and new trade hubs. As you increase in notoriety and your financial means increase you gain access to new weapons and equipment for your ship and new avenues open up for you.The learning curve is steep enough to make even the most doped up Tour de France rider think twice before attempting the climb. The game explains only the very basics to you, everything else you have to figure out for yourself. This is something that makes Beyond The Frontier, and in fact all X games, something of a challenge to get into. The game is extremely unforgiving to newcomers and unless you have the patience to restart a few times this probably isn't the game for you.Despite it's age Beyond The Frontier is still a good game with some good solid core gameplay. It is also a game with it's share of faults the most prominent being the lack alternate starting points and the inability to change ships in game something which makes starting a new game rather cumbersome, even for an experienced player. The similarities between this and later incarnations is of course also a detriment to buying it nowadays because you will get much the same game if your purchase the latest installment in the series, only it will be an improved game.

												It's a great game, but it unfortunately suffers from a couple of problems, some major and some minor.The tutorial isn't really all that helpful, it gives you an idea of what you're doing--it lets you get comfortable with the X-Shuttle itself, but what you're supposed to do is not really elaborated on.The trading system is good, but I feel like it would be better if you were able to walk around these production centers and stuff (Although, you can do some EVA in X Tension). The music is good at setting an atmosphere, it gives you a feeling that you really are flying through space--not some high-intensity, strings-heavy Hans Zimmer♥♥♥♥♥♥ of course, the music is well-situated when you get into a fight, but even the fighting has its own problems.The enemy AI is awful, it's just awful. I would find more challenge if the game had them fire back or at least tail you closely, but instead they turn into giant Kamikaze-units and try to ram into you, leading to cheap deaths. You usually have to try to take them out in one pass or just make sure you're ALWAYS behind them, or approaching them in a way where they can't turn and fly into you.The graphics are really a mixed bag. The use of low lighting and lens flare make it feel like a science-fiction title, with stars' blaring light casting through your ship. Planets are also well-drawn. But the ships and centers look very...well...I would say ""1990's"" if this game wasn't developed in 1999. The graphics are bland, a lot of grays, greens and reds when more life could be put in.Ship control is great! The ship handles pretty well. There isn't too much to be said since it flies wrather swell.As an overall verdict, the game is...decent. The ship control is good, and background graphics are good, I love the trading system and it's fun to become anything from a supply merchant, to a drug supplier, to a bounty hunter and, when you amass enough credits, entrepeneur. The game is hampered by poor enemy AI and bland graphics with ships and stations in space. But, overall, I'd recommend it.			",129,18,4,11,23,1,15

												A program of complexity, this game is daunting at first sight, its graphics and mechanics are not of familiarity, and learning anything is severely limited. But with a little patience, this game grows in your favour, as you learn each ship, race, station, and mechanic of this diverse X Universe. Beyond what you think it is, it's a game of occasional trial and error, however with the internet to help, you can be in command. It is the start of a new way to think of this series, to propose a new way you see retro highlights, and to really see Beyond the Frontier.			",20,1,0,0,4,0,3

												Pretty good space trading game, not complicated at all and easy to get in to. I am enjoying it so far. Hopefully the rest of the series will be as appealing to me.  It's worth trying if you like space trading games, and the X super box ever goes on sale or is bundled again.Tip: there is a brief text file in the game directory you should look at first before starting. It will tell you exactly what you need to do to get going. e.g trade solar cells and buy a SETA so you can move fast right away. If you don't know that you may spoend more than 15 minutes moving at a snails pace and that wouldn't be fun. Definitely do 1 trade, then next immediately grab a SETA and keep going from there.

												Unless you're getting this for the sake of nostalgia, don't bother.  It's just full of frustrations and inconveniences that you won't find in modern games.  Credit is owed to the people who put this package together and I do appreciate the effort - there's even a complete guide in the game folder.  It started up on Windows 10 without any problems, and I was able to get it working with my Logitech Extreme3Dpro (thrust control does not work, as with most of these older games you have to bind ""A"" and ""Z"" to the side buttons).I played it for a little bit, but I just can't get into it.  The graphics are too bad for me to tell the difference between the different types of stations.  The trading system isn't too bad, and I like the system for building your own stations.  I'm hoping X2 will be better.			",35,14,0,9,12,0,4

												Complex trade/fight/think/build space simulator. I played so many hours X2, X3 TC and X3 AP I have app 1000hrs logged on + this one several years ago. Still this very first game is amazing even today, which is end of 2015. Will buy it again. It has some charm to push you play it again, game created with love. Only true classics can pass test of the time and X: Beyond the Frontier achieve it. BTW this game does get quite bad reviews back than, because nearly non of the reviewers uncover true and complex space sim inside. Game starts slowly, but I really like how you start from zero and grow to hero. True legend /and I am saying this even after I played a lot elite on my zx spectrum back than/.			",91,21,1,8,20,0,24

												You start out on a routine mission to test a new propulsion system capable of transporting you across space in an instant but during testing there was a malfunction and the player is transported to an unknown part of the universe…The game is rather old now so a fair level of patience is required. The keyboard controls are frustrating at first and mouse support is lacking. AI and space combat is very simple which will probably cause some frustration and panic as the AI enemy flies directly at you but the storyline is solid, learning about the game’s economics and the dynamic feel of the universe is rather fun.

												Sure, the game is a classic, Elite reborn etc. What everybody fails to mention is:Its trading system is surprisingly shallow, and its battle mechanics are almost non-existent.It is uninventively repetitive, time-consuming and requires a lot of grinding, which looks like fun for only a few hours in the beginning.Much of it's downs are so obviously in plain sight it looks more like an alpha than a complete game with lots of fixes.Not a bad game, but to balance out all those ""OMG IT'S FLAWLESS"" reviews this should be mentioned.

												Spiritual successor to Elite.  Much deeper economics model: you can build your own space stations!  There is an overarching story arc, but you are free to pursue your own path.  It is a slow starter though - can be a bit repetative at the beginning when you're just trying to build yourself up.  Cheap, and runs great on older machine specs.  X2 and X3 are for more recent hardware.			",151,49,16,35,18,3,67

												ProsIf you liked the old School Wing Commander Privateer mixed with maybe a bit of some sort of business tycoon you will probably like this game. I really enjoyed creating an empire of factories throughout the galaxy making me money while I was off blasting away bad guys and pimping out my one and only ship.ConsOlder game, bit cryptic... may need to Google things like a manual, keyboard shortcuts and a map. Was also a bit slow at the start until you get your first Solar Power Plant and start to see real money coming in. Graphics are of course also a bit dated, but as such on anything somewhat new it'll run fabulously at full 1080p =)SummaryI was having too much fun in the game just flying around, setting up chains of factories that build off each other and make me profit every step of the way, that it took me 79 hours to finally ""Finish"" this old school game. (Though it just becomes a big open world after)Forgot to say. I recommend using Pinnacle Game Profiler with a controller of your choice (I used an XBox 360 controller). I played the majority of the game without Pinnacle, but definitely more intuitive with the ability to map keyboard keys to the controller in a more intuitive way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm 16 hours in as of the time of this writing and still not even close to being a tenth of the way done. This game is one of the best I've ever played, easily outperforming 3000 AD's ""Universal Combat"" or Lucas Art's ""Jedi Starfighter."" If you're a fan of Firefly, Battlestar, Star Wars, Star Trek, O Game, or maybe even Star Gate, this game undoubtedly hosts at least moderate appeal for you. A sandbox in the purest sense, X gives you nigh unlimited freedom to explore and plunder as you see fit. Reap the profits of interstellar commercial trade or engage in illegal smuggling runs as a roguish pirate. Explore the unknown reaches of space, or just go in phasers blasting and face the consequences. Whether you play as a profiteer, a noble explorer, or a lone ranger, X strikes the perfect balance between free form gameplay and fun. I've just begun building my trade empire and I can't wait to see what lies in store for me. For a game that came out in 1999, the visuals are gorgeous. Vast, intricate, colorful nebulas set in the backdrop of open, black space instill a feeling of mystery and invite an air of wonder. Gargantuan space stations whirl slowly in fixed orbits of the monstrous planets they call home. Warp gates lie dormant at the edges of their respective sectors, occasionaly springing to life with the passage of ships. The cockpit of your craft, while relatively simple and perhaps a bit barren, has been lovingly crafted, with small details like an eject lever when you look up.

												If ever was there to be a game that represents the ideals of capitolisim, it is this. I love space sims sine the first I played X-wing vs Tie, and for the longest time I favored Freelancer of the king of a genre that I beleived to be dead, but no longer, this is the first in an on-going series of great games, that of which has amazed me and gone straight to the top of my what to do list, it has destroyed the credability of the so called next gen gaming that is thrown at you every day, as I play this humble 1999 game and let a shelf of brand new games rot to the left of my computer as I have only disapointment in them, for they can not even hope to embody the ideals of this game, I speak not for this game alone though my friends, I speak for this sereis, and that I have regained hope in the future of space sims and that they are revived and better than ever, with the release of a new game in this sereis on the verge, i dare call myself a hypocrite in saying that all hope is not loss.

												The graphics are of course outdated, and it takes awhile before you can even fight. But the sense of being lost in a strange universe having to struggle for everything makes everything you do seem a massive accomplishment.In this game you are a test pilot who while testing an experimetal drive ends up lost in space, literally you have no clue where you could be or what is going on, oh and to top it off your weapons are fried, and you have no way to return. This means you have to figure everything out for yourself and somehow get some guns. And of course the lack of tutorial or manual adds to the sense of being lost in a strange universe.If you are easily frustrated or like everything handed to you on a platter, this game is not for you.

												I played through this game just for the story so I could move on to the better-looking (and hopefully better all-around) sequals in the X series. I'd like to say I put about 40 hours into this game, 40 hours that I will never get back. The only other open-world space sim I've played was Freelancer back in high school and that game was a hundred times better than X: Beyond the Frontier. Let me tell you exactly what this game has in store for gamers:Start off with almost nothing with no instructions on what to do next. Search the internet for guides and find only a couple. Fly back and forth between space stations buying x number of items to sell to another station for x amount of credits. Repeat this process about 200 times until you can eventually buy whatever stations you want to take the stupid dock-and-trade chore out of the game while they make money for you. Once you've gotten to this point in the game prepare to be further dissapointed. The rest of the game consists of flying back and forth across the universe for hours, finding specific objects and only once in a while participating in some very bland, uninspiring, and unrewarding dogfights against the simplest and easiest AI.I know this game came out in 1999 but it's seriously bad. I wish I could get those wasted hours back. Never have I played a game where after beating it I feel like it was all a chore with no rewards.			",128,8,2,16,18,0,28

This game is about Good Control, EQ, IQ and time... this is very time consuming game...

												I don't recommend it these days. The game engine is very outdated. I would recommend you just try out X2: The Threat instead and up.  X-Tension is suppose to have a good story but still runs on an outdated engine. X3 The Reunion was an okay game but the HUD was a nightmare. I do not recommend X-Rebirth either because it is crap and a disgrace to the community. The main thing I liked about these older X games is that they had great ship and station designs that are lost on the newer X3+ games. A moment of silence for entering Akeela's Beacon. So sad and beautiful.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Usually I don't discriminate games because of their age but this one is too old, it really is. The game mechanics are completely outdated and having your own economic empire is absolutely laborious since you have to approach every station to receive your money from it. Back in 1999 when it was released, Xbtf didn't just live from its atmosphere or story telling. The main reason for its success were the advanced trading possibilities that were phenomenal for that time and the fact that you could fly through three dimensional space in a giant universe with also quite good graphics. Nowadays these won't impress anybody anymore.It's nothing against the game itself but you should better try the other X-series games.			",98,12,5,20,12,1,32

												Okay, so I played this when it was free on steam and it was quite literally one of the WORST games I have ever had the misfortune to play. I spent about an hour trying to finish the tutorial, while coping with inverted controls (which I hate and there is no way that I found to turn off) text that is near impossible to make out, and timed segments. In tutorials I like to figure things out at my own pace, but halfway through the tutorial I was KICKED BACK TO THE MAIN MENU, simply because I hadn't completed the TUTORIAL fast enough. THE TUTORIAL. Another thing that was awful was the looking around. The best way I can describe it is ""drifting"". It never stopped when I wanted to, so I usually ended up crashing into things.Overall, terrible game. Maybe I didn't give enough chances, but I really couldn't get into it. There are much better games like this out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I ""completed"" the accelerating part of the tutorial by doing a BARREL ROLL.  Then I failed the decelerating part because they wouldn't accept the aformentioned barrel roll this time so I got a game over.  Why?  Because thanks to the controls, that was about ALL I could do! (Besides turning around and shooting my instructor's ship anyway)  Turns out, the accelerating/decelerating commands weren't even mapped to ANYTHING, not the mouse, not a joystick, let alone my keyboard.  And it won't even let you set the keys yet it somehow knows which button to reject when you try to because it's already taken by another command, like doing that BARREL ROLL!  Noooo, we could never take that nifty move out to make the game playable, could we?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EXPECTING SPACE COMBAT - there is a combat aspect to it but it is first and foremost a space trader game.The first hour can be summed up very easily.Spend 5-10 minutes flying a tutorialBuy thingFind BaseSpend 5-10 minutes flying in a straight lineSell thingBuy more thingsSpend 5-10 minutes flying in a straight line, discover the new base doesn't buy your thing.Spend 5-10 minutes flying in a straight line, discover the other new base doesn't buy your thingI didn't spend enough time to see if the game ever accelerates out of this monotonous cycle, but frankly after the first hour of gameplay I expect something to make a game seem dynamic. I can see how back in the day this game may have been new and innovative, but if it was something great it has aged poorly. I'm just glad I got to test this on the free weekend before dumping $$$ onto it. My advice would be to skip straight to X2 - the limited plot isn't worth the tediously repetitive gameplay.
