												It's really hard for me to do an unbiased review of this game, so I would rather speak about mypersonal experience.When I was about 11 years old, I played the first X-COM: UFO Defense through and through.As a kid I thought it was the most challenging, well-put togheter game I'd ever played.Time passed by, and, one fateful day, I read the review of X-COM: Terror From the Deep in a frenchmagazine. There was only one thing left to do: BUY. IT. NOW.And, thanks to my parents (and me being a good boy around xmas ;)) I got my hands on a copy of thisgame. I still own the original box, floppy disc edition.I played this game at least one week per month for about a year and a half.It's now 2014, and I still haven't found a game so compelling since. Everything in this game pulled mein, and would never let me go. The music. The atmosphere. This always present feeling of dread. The pressure put on your shoulders when trying to save as many civilians as possible during a Terror mission without sacrificing your favorite soldiers. And, above all else, the incredible depth of the tactical options that were offered to you throughout the game. Both in combat situation and on the Geosphere's more laid-back, strategical planning.This is the kind of game that involves you so much that you start to create your own stories about your pixelated soldiers. I knew their names.I knew what they were capable, or uncapable of doing while on a mission. I knew them, and losing any of them had some kind of impact on me. ""They were my soldiers. my mates. They were good soldiers, and I'll never forget them.""To me, X-COM: Terror From the Deep defines the word ""classic"" when it comes to Strategic planning and TacticalCombat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Playing this game will put hair on your chest, allow you to eat lightning and crap thunder.Bought this game the year it came out.It makes Dark Souls, and Darkest Dungeon-like games seem kind to you.If you make it through the first mission without losing over 1/2 of your team, the A.I. just gave you a freebee.Playing this game on easy will allow you to conquer the rest of the X-Com franchise games, as well as most other games like this as if you were a God.If you like unforgiving, yet rewarding games... this game is for you.If you hate a challenge... run. the. hell. away. very. far. and. very. fast.110/10 would allow this game to humiliate me again for another 20 years.

TL;DR: I was raised on this game. It will forever be my favorite PC game of all time.  I would hide under my covers, way past my bedtime, as my older brother played through the night. It gave me horrid nightmares as an 8 year old. :)The following is an excerpt from an email I wrote to my older brother on 8/26/11: (spoilers below)""Over 15 years ago we began an extermination of an alien threat known as the ‘Terror from the Deep.’ I am proud to inform you that our mission was completed in a “Superhuman”-ly fashion at 0100 hours this morning. CAPT KDW “Da Bomb” lead a team of advanced X-COM aquanauts through the abyssal depths of T’leth. CDR Leviticus, LCDR Sigourney Weaver, and LT Tommy Lee Jones destroyed the final life-support pillars and personally escorted the alien mastermind to the gates of hell. It took 11 months to research and build the Leviathan. In the final month of December, 5 to 12 USOs were detected and engaged daily. From January 2040 (X-COM’s formation) the aliens conducted twice-per-month artefact sites, shipping routes, terror sites, and X-COM base assault missions. Though an alien colony was eliminated for every month beyond June, the entire globe was littered with half a dozen known sites. This wasn't my first attempt. The original X-COM had a glitch that reset the difficulty to Beginner. The true Superhuman difficulty makes TFTD pretty darn difficult. Add on the fantastic modifications from XCOM UTIL, you face a formidable foe. Here are some of my most notable struggles: **Base defense, first month.** Initial layout is nearly impossible to defend. Aquatoids use Mind Control. Thermal tazers are required to neutralize your own soldiers. Calcinite (deep sea diver) take 20+ rounds of Gauss Rifle.**Terror attack, first month.** Live Deep One or BUST. Period.**First Lobsterman encounter.** I am convinced that it is impossible to kill a lobsterman with gauss technology. They take a minimum 2-3 rounds of Sonic Cannon.**First shipping route or artefact site.** Even the weakest alien soldiers have better than 100% aimed shot. The cyberdisk (bio-drone) and triscene (dinosaur) are by far the biggest challenge in the game. I have never seen either one miss and both can fire 5+ shots in a single reaction or turn. I’m not sure if they can be mind-controlled (I never broke 100+ MC skill) but they both can move across the entire map to destroy your squad. The bio-drone’s death explosion is lethal even with Mag. Ion Armour. The triscene is probably the most rare creature in the game, fortunately. No exaggeration here: the triscene will absorb 20+ rounds of sonic cannon before it dies on Superhuman.**Medium to Very Large USOs.** Basically requires Sonic Oscillator. Barracudas often get blown to bits or can’t keep up. Without the advanced weaponry, this effectively ends your game within the month they begin appearing. There were other difficulties; most of them dealing with Molecular Control / Research / Financial. So – what was the ultimate secret of my success?1.       Hand-to-Hand. This was the best tactic and the ultimate key to my success. Half my squad was equipped with Sonic Pistol / Thermal Lance. The thermal lance costs about 8 TU’s, has 100% accuracy, and turns lobsters into meatloaf. The sonic pistol is extremely underestimated and in my opinion the best overall weapon in the game.2.       Research. Weapons, Armor, MC, Submersibles. Proper order is essential. If researched improperly, you cannot complete the game.3.       Manufacture. Technicians can make certain items (Gauss Cannon, Particle Disturbance Sensor) for profit. With a permanent manufacture base, money is never an issue, only sponsorship to avoid losing the game.4.       SWS (Tanks). They die so easily, but they are by far the most effective scouts. Plus replaceable!5.       Aquanauts. I hired over 300 soldiers over the course of the game. Every initial statistic should be over 40, especially reaction, otherwise your soldier is just cannon fodder. MC strength needs to be a minimum of 80. Any soldier vulnerable to mind control was sacked or sent into USOs with primed sonic pulsers.Instead of having a full squadron armed with cannons, I found diversity is best. There is no reason to leave anyone in the ship, ever. MC specialists (as many as possible!!!) should be equipped with pistols and following your scouts. When in doubt, nothing beats the old elevator trick or blasting away entire ships with the Disruptor Pulse Launcher. I was surprised to find that the traditionally difficult Tentaculant (STINKIN’ BRAIN) were relatively easy to kill. Their only real threat potential is their knack for sneaking around the battleground unnoticed. Once you’re well equipped, or have mind control, the game is simply an endurance challenge, regardless of difficulty."" Soon, OpenXcom will release TFTD support. I'm anxious to jump back into this game and try some of the truly difficult challenges: No Psionics, Ironman, Aggressive/Sneaky AI, the works. Thanks for sharing in my passion. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												X-COM Terror from the Deep is a huge strategy game based mainly on the players descision on many things at once. The plot is that Earth is being invaded by aliens from the sea who aren't hesitant to kill anyone preventing them from their main goal: Taking over the entire planet. The player's job is to be the Lead Commander of the whole X-COM facilities. The player is given a simple job: Stop the aliens from destroying the world. Now, when I saw ""Lead Commander"", I mean exactly that. The player controls everything that is given to it, such as sending out patrols, whether to attc\ack aliens or not, buying/selling materials, hireing people to work for you, and a whole lot more.This game is, like I said, a big strategy game. It involves lots of numbers, and money is extremely important. If you don't have enough money till the end of the month, the world governers shut down X-COM and the aliens win. The player has to make the right choices on what to manufacture, patrol, construct, attack, and most importantly, research. I have to say, researching is the key factor of getting the most out of this game. Without research, the player will have to stick to harpoon guns which don't do that much damage at first. But with research, the player can have better weapons that deal more damage, and I mean a LOT of damage.This game is pixelated, so it's graphics are kinda poor. But the strategy, thinking, and the numbers all come together in this, so the player needs to really take everything into account when it invovles money. Battling is pretty intense too. The battle system is based around the player having it's turn to get it's men together and plan an attack. Most of the battles are under water, so it's pretty dark at first. But when the player starts moving it's men around, the environment starts to pan out and you have a good look on the battleground. Once the player has done it's turn, it's time for the aliens turn. The aliens basically do whatever the player can do: move, attack, or run away and group up. It's all based on strategy and knowing what aleins have what, cause it's not just one kind of alien attacking Earth. There are many species of aliens and all have different capabilities than other aliens.I fully recommend this game for the strategic and brain power one has to use, and is my dad's favorite game, so after watching him play a lot, and after me playing a while myself, I've come to fully enjoy this game. I hope you will too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to be a huge fan of Ufo: Enemy Unknown (The European version of the original XCOM: Ufo Defense) and I got this XCOM complete pack recently.I remembered how these old games are incredibly hard, so I started on Easy mode to get used to the game.On my very first mission I took my first step out of the submarine and was immediately shot by a rocket launcher which killed 7 of my 8 soldiers instantly. The 8th soldier panicked and killed himself.Welcome to Easy Mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A great game, but as a sequel it does the bare minimum.The aliens have launched a Terror attack on a cargo vessel. My X-COM operatives have fought their way into the middle cabins on the deck of the tanker. Three units are grouped together, preparing to breach another room. Suddenly, one of the three is taken under molecular control but opts not to shoot the other two and instead runs into the unexplored room. Now I face a decision: do I enter the room knowing that I will likely be fired upon by my own unit or wait it out, leaving her inside with unknown terrors?I decide to wait. As soon as my aquanaut comes to her senses she is blasted repeatedly by a Bio Drone until she drops unconscious. Now I face another problem as the room is quite small and there is nowhere I can safely fire upon the Bio Drone without getting caught in its death explosion. But I have a wounded soldier that needs help ASAP so I burst into action. One unit dashes into the room taking only time to grab the unconscious body of his comrade before rushing back out. While the door is still open the remaining aquanaut pulls a grenade off his belt, primes it and throws it right at the base of the Bio Drone before retreating a short ways. The blast from the grenade blows out the walls, yet still hovering in the smoke is the Bio Drone, now able to see my exposed grenadier. Fortunately his Ion Armor absorbs most of the shots that rain down on him leaving him a little shaken but with no fatal wounds. Suspecting that the alien can't take much more punishment he sets up and fires back. He connects and this time the floating death disc goes down in a fiery explosion even bigger than that of the grenade. My shooter is ok but a poor civilian gets caught in the edge of the blast and is killed.The fighting is over in this sector but there is still drama left. My unconscious warrior is bleeding out but the nearest medic is several rooms away. The medic and the aquanaut hauling her limp form sprint toward each other. Will they make it in time to save her? Yes! He patches her up and pumps her with stimulants to get her back on her feet. Now weaponless, weak and in need of a few weeks off to recover, she is out of the fight; but she is alive.------------------------------------------------------------------------------X-COM has the ability to create moments like these that are wholly your own. This episode felt like something out of an action film to me. It's complete with heroics, suspense, mad dashes, aliens, hard decisions, explosions and a nameless citizen as collateral damage. Combine the combat side with the also enjoyable base management and research side and Terror From the Deep is truly an excellent game.However, taken in context of its predecessor, UFO Defense, it is a weak sequel. It is largely just a reskin with some tweaked stats for equipment and aliens. The biggest additions are new environments to fight in and a bit of alien lore. Ultimately it's more like a standalone expansion than a true sequel.I would be remiss if I didn't mention a few gripes I had beyond the weak sequel issue. First, the game has a few pretty bad bugs, mostly within the research tree. Fortunately there is a small, free, fan made fix for these bugs called XcomUtil that is popular enough that you shouldn't have trouble finding it. And finally, the last place you invade at the end of the game, T'Leth, is just awful. The 2nd and 3rd portions of this mission are seemingly never ending slogs through linear winding corridors and rooms with relatively sparse alien resistance. My units were constantly out of energy from all the running. To top it off you cannot save your game during the final (3rd) portion which made for a marathon of several hours to finish both the 2nd and 3rd maps in one sitting. It left a definite bitter aftertaste lingering after completing this otherwise fantastic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terror from the Deep is the sequel to X-COM UFO Defense that puts you back in charge of the international global defense organization, X-COM, except now the classic stereotypical alien/paranormal encounters have been replaced with aquatic Lovecraftian horrors and B-movie sea creatures.The basic gameplay is very similar to X-Com: UFO Defense. In fact, you could call it a simple retheme with new graphics and not be too far off.I prefer the setting, charm, aesthetics, and difficulty balance of the original, but the sequel does several things that I find to be nice improvements on the formula. There are a number of small gameplay improvements vs UFO Defense; for example, when you destroy an alien base, the game gives you a message saying so, instead of you having to abort the mission before seeing for sure that you destroying every base control panel section. You can also open doors without moving through them, a definitely useful feature. The terror sites in the original all used the same urban terrain set, while the terror sites in Terror from the Deep can use one of four different terrains (seaport, island resort, cruise liner, cargo ship), which is nice for variety. Alien sub designs are also more intricate and complex than the UFOs in the original.Alien base assaults are a bigger ordeal, with 2 parts to the mission; first, you have to fight through the well defended surface entrance to the base, and then explore the comparatively empty inner levels. Melee weapons are fun and new to the series, and are very effective against some tough enemy types.The biggest difference, though, is the atmosphere. The homage to Lovecraft is obvious throughout the game; even the general theme of ""ancient mysterious aliens came to Earth many eons ago and are coming out of their hidden places in the deep parts of the world to reclaim it"" is basically Lovecraftian. The alien architecture is reminiscent of Neo-Victorian era style science fiction and depictions of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea era submersible technology and similar; there is a lot of brass looking riveted metal and almost steampumk-ish looking alien equipment. There are also hints at other undersea myths like the lost city of Atlantis, and the Gill-Man/Swamp Creature and other aquatic B-movie monsters. Compared to UFO Defense, the enemies are tougher, deadlier, and scarier, and the environments are darker and architecture more complicated. It's now harder than ever to keep your soldiers alive, which brings me to my next point.The game is difficult. Very difficult. Terror from the Deep was designed to be hard for people who thought X-COM UFO Defense was easy on 'superhuman' difficulty. Weapon clips are much smaller, there are no infinite ammo weapons, and all weapons are designed for underwater use. Some of them, like torpedo launchers (Terror from the Deep's version of rockets) don't work at all out of water (terror sites). The fact that there are no land only weapons to use (like regular firearms) is annoying and makes the game more difficult, for sure. Speaking of water vs land weapon use, grenades can be thrown underwater as if through air. This may annoy you if you take notice of unrealistic physics in games.I've mentioned that base assaults are long 2 part missions. Terror sites on boats are also big 2 part missions. You will have to kill A LOT of aliens to complete a boat terror site; it's quite an endurance test. Alien bases in particular are heavily defended and almost always deep enough underwater that the environment is dark regardless of the time of day. They can be brutal.Now for as for the game's flaws; the fact that most of the game is underwater makes a lot of the environments feel a bit too similar, even though there are a variety of underwater terrain types. The colors blue and yellow are a bit overused and make the game's aesthetics a bit garish, especially when compared to the pleasingly colorful original X-Com.Also, the game features the same somewhat cumbersome user interface and many of the same bugs as X-Com UFO Defense. The difficulty bug from the original is not present here, but the disappearing ammo bug still is (in the DOS version, at least. The Windows version fixed it). Aliens also like to carry around melee weapons, but they don't ever use them. Worst of all, if you research a couple things in the wrong order, it can make your game unwinnable by making some required research unavailable. Even if you don't screw up your research path, the research tree is more convoluted and requires more live aliens than that of UFO Defense, which can be frustrating because it's not obvious which alien types you need to research to unlock other techs.Maps are, in general, larger. Bases and boat terror sites span across two separate maps instead of 1, and even UFO crash site maps are larger than they were in UFO Defense. The 2 part terror missions can be pretty tedious, and they can drag on forever. The boat maps feature more rooms and more complicated architecture than usually seen in X-Com games, and as a result, there will often be aliens standing around somewhere waiting for you to find them because they won't ever leave the room they started in. It makes for very long missions, and an overall long and drawn out game.MODS:You can play the game by itself, especially if you have the Steam version that comes bundled with DosBox (The Steam version also includes the Windows version, in the 'TFTD' subfolder in the game folder). I recommend some mods, though. XcomUtil is a great simple mod that works for both UFO Defense and Terror from the Deep. It gives Gauss weapons infinite ammo (like lasers in UFO Defense) and fixes other bugs.TftD Extender is a bit more extensive, and makes the game more playable, in my opinion. While much of it overlaps with XcomUtil, it also has options to make boat terror sites only 1 part missions, sub crash site maps a bit smaller (more like UFO Defense size maps), there are optional alternate tech trees, aliens can use melee weapons, and you can tell engineers to make and auto-sell equipment, among other features. With some tweaking, you can run both Xcomutil and Extender at the same time. I HIGHLY recommend using TFTDextender if you are going to play the game nowadays.CONCLUSION (TL;DR):If you've always wanted to try a tactical turn based strategy game where you fight Lovecraftian horrors underwater, or if you are a big fan of the original X-COM UFO Defense and would like a very similar game with additional challenge and variety, then you should definitely try it. I prefer the original UFO Defense, but this game is unique and worth experiencing, in my opinion. (Don't let the difficulty scare you away; if you are very familiar with the first game, this game isn't much worse, except for the alien base assaults, which are absolutely brutal.)

												Summary: A harder version of X-Com 1 set underwaterMultiplayer: NoCompletion: 20 hrsCards: NoCloud: NoI have a love/hate relationship with the second X-Com game. On the one hand, it's X-Com! On the other hand, it's X-Com... but 4x harder! For all intents and purposes this is X-Com 1 with a few important tweaks and changes.The first change you'll notice is that everything takes place under water, with the exception of a few terror missions. Thus you cannot place bases on land. It's essentially the inverse of the first game. It's no big deal, but it's worth noting that some weapons do not operate on land, you cannot use flying suits on land, and some aliens only appear on land while others only appear in water.Clips have been reduced *drastically*. Powerful cannons are now limited to 10 shots, with full-auto removed on heavy weapons, which I think is a good, though perhaps overly punishing change. Sonic weapons should be limited, sure, but I feel the Gauss weapons should have retained unlimited ammo, or at least given much more generous clips. At least the limited Sonic Cannon ammo is somewhat offset by the fact that you'll find Sonic Cannon clips up the wazoo when all aliens start carrying them.Enemies received some interesting changes. Remember how Chryssalids became 100% non-threatning as soon as you got flying suits? Not so in this game. Tentaculats will float across the ocean floor and happily devour your brains wherever you are. Hallucinoids and Xarquids don't explode upon death, unlike pesky cyberdiscs (however Bio-Drones do, but they're relatively rare), but they appear much more often.TFTD introduces my possibly favorite weapon, melee drills, particularly the lowest level drill. If you turn a corner and face an alien, these drills make short work of them using barely any time units with unlimited ammo. Bloody brilliant, and highly effective against lobsters. Blaster Launchers and Mind Control are as effective as they were in the previous game, so roughly the same tactics apply by the endgame.Probably the biggest change and single worst feature about the game is how massive the maps can be. They're not just huge length an width-wise, but they span multiple stories high. I loathe the start of the next month, where shipping route attacks occur. The abominable ships take forever to search, and the disturbance scanner doesn't work if the aliens don't move. Alien bases equally suffer. Go ahead. Take a peek inside one, I dare you.Exacerbating the problem is how quickly your soldiers run out of energy. Your poor energy bar doesn't replenish nearly enough to cover that much ground in reasonable time. It does allow for more time units to be retained for reaction fire, but I'd rather have my troops be able to move into better cover instead of saving up TUs for reaction shots. For this reason, it may be a good idea to take a few Displacers/Coelacanths to scout for you on those gratuitously large maps.The research system in some old versions of the game are somewhat buggy. I believe the Steam version does not have this problem, but it is something to be aware of, just in case.I admit it; I'm too scared to try this game without save-scumming. Even then it's still challenging, and the large maps are still tedious. It's fun, though not as fun as the first game, and the charm goes down very fast because of the problems. Ultimately, if you want a harder X-Com 1, this is it. I rate this a 7/10. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I couldn't get into this game as much as the original. I'm still giving this a positive review however because there are people who swear by this game and prefer it over the original. It plays fairly similar to the previous game in the series except it's all underwater now, which adds a few unique mechanics, such as a few guns which can only be fired underwater. This game is also exceptionally more difficult. The enemies at first don't seem all that much different but soon into the game you'll start to encounter really tough enemies. Also instead of hunting down alien bases and eliminating them, there's some story behind what you're doing. There's also A LOT more two stage missions than the first game. I recommend this game for people who that the original X-com was too easy, and for those others who just want a challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My first experience with the game was a demo that only gave you one playable mission. Needless to say I was hooked but I would not see this game again until a couple years later when I found it at an outlet store...and boy was I in for a surprise. Terror from the deep turned out to be much more immersing then I had previously expected and within just a few hours of playing XCOM:TFTD became one of my all time favorite video games on PC. Where do you start with a video game that is so expansive?! I guess at the beginning. From the onset it's all about decision making. Where is your location going to be, what type of research are you going to work on, how many weapons do you purpose you need to go into battle? These are all decisions that  are up to you and from the gate I've personally never experience such huge responsibility in a video game before. Throw the fact that you only have so much money to do this with then your really in for an intense decision making situation and we haven't even gotten into any gameplay! The games plays on a 24hr(fake time of course) time globe(that is right a globe) that charts everything on a day to day basis so a mission can happen at any moment. There are two types of battle situations. The first situation arrives from alien ship intercepts where you send your weapon fighter space jet to battle with a spotted UFO. These encounters don't last but for a few seconds but it is from this you continue to appreciate the significant amount of detail this game has to offer. From this you may destroy,  damage, or retreat from the engaged aircraft and as a result you may just be in for a very tough battle ahead of you. Enemy ships can crash, or land safely upon the ocean floor and from there the real battle takes place. As it was from the start every decision you make from fitting your squad with the right amount of armor to positioning them in the right area for combat are critical to your overall success in these missions. The gameplay is turn-based and somewhat similar to moving chess pieces across a board, only, in this case your pieces can move a lot more and pack fire power a plenty. All the while an eerie soundtrack is playing as you move your players across an uncharted plain uncertain of where the enemy may be. The decision making, the uncertainty, the sheer adulation of a successful mission where everyone of your crew makes it home safe, these are the experiences that make up Terror from the Deep. Though this is not the more popular game of the series XCOM-TFTD was my first foray into the franchise and the experience was definitely worth more then the price of admission. Though recently the series has found its self on the next gen platform, I recommend you experience this classic masterpiece that once gave me hours of pure on the edge of your seat fun...and its a strategy game people how much more convincing do you need?!!!

												I purchased a copy of this game in the late 90's for DOS. It was the first X-Com game I owned, but not the first turn based strategy. I still have not completed it, as I never played it on an easy difficulty. What is the fun in that? It remains one of the best games I have ever played. And I will tell you why:- This game, unlike the original X-Com and the new X-Com offers nearly limitless tactical combat. Every part of the environments you fight in, except the base ground itself, can be utterly destroyed. My favorite tactic was to equip all my soldiers with high explosive weapons and literally blast the landscape apart. You cannot destroy certain parts until you unlock technologies later in the game, but eventually you can destroy pretty much everything. The best armor has a hover option like the others. You can use motion scanners to map out enemy movements and plan your strike room by room. You can use motion detecting mines to lock down/minimize enemy flanking movements. You can equip a stunning melee weapon and charge unprepared aliens. If you encounter an unwinnable situation you can recover as much gear as possible and evacuate your remaining troops. Even light plays a factor, you can use flares and phosporous weapons to reveal enemies at longer distances, night missions are horribly difficult.- The AI is fantastically brilliant, for the most part. Sometimes Aliens will seem to wander randomly, however, once they ""know"" you are there, they are deviously adept at tearing apart your troops. It really takes a strong tactical strategy to take them down when on a ground mission. On the overworld, the UFO sightings are not random, they are actually building forces, completing objectives, and growing in power over time.- The research projects are wonderful, they are complex enough to require a serious effort in maintaining a technological paralell with the enemy, while not so overburdened to make useless items.It isn't a perfect game, there are some notable issues:- There are bugs with the research tree that make the game unwinnable if not researched in the right order. There are in game fixes to this but they are near impossible to figure out without a guide. Research these before you seriously play the game, or get a community-made patch that fixes it.- Sometimes you may click the wrong spot or accidentially click as you are examining the battlefield and your soldier performs the wrong action or leaves himself horribly exposed. This is an unfortunate side effect of the way the engine was made. Save often.- This game has a hard hard learning curve. You will have to restart several times a-la Dark Souls to actually learn how to play the game.You should play this game. Do it now. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everything I said in my review of X-com: UFO Defense applies here. http://steamcommunity.com/id/markusramikin/recommended/7760/ This is still the same classic, terrific game. Which only makes sense, since this game is almost a palette swap of the original. Well, maybe that's a bit harsh; there are of course some minor changes in gameplay, and some improvements in the interface and controls, there's a new story. I'd say the graphics are nicer in this game - they seem clearer and more colorful.The theme is different, too. It's less X-files now and more Lovecraftian horror.And let's not forget, a major spike in difficulty! So if you thought the original was hard, you're in for a new experience here. The original Ufo Defense came out with a bug that made all difficulty levels play like ""Beginner"", but nobody realized this for a while, and there were a lot of complaints about the game being ""too easy"". Eventually the bug was patched, but the developers were misled for a while, and as a side effect, Terror from the Deep ended up being even harder. This comedy of errors gave us one of the most challenging and satisfying games I've ever played. Straight up firefights won't get you far - you'll want dye grenades, explosives, scout-sniper tactics, everything you can do to desperately counter the edge in firepower, armor, and accuracy that the aliens have on you, at least at the start.As gameplay improvements go, I was particularly grateful for the ability to open doors without having to actually walk through them (and get shot). But that functionality was added back to the original game by openxcom. Which brings me to the obligatory PSA...:<Public Service Announcement>: Make sure that you PLAY IT WITH OPENXCOM.http://openxcom.org/git-builds/OpenXCom is a free rebuild of the game that utilizes original game assets (so you still need to actually own this game). It fixes a bunch of bugs, and improves various interface inadequacies. It's still the same game, just polished more.It also adds easy moddability, with some mods already added to the base installation but completely optional. So you can play completely vanilla, with an experience indistinguishable from the original game except for the absence of bugs - or you can play with a number of common sense improvements - or you can download mods that change and expand the game.</Public Service Announcement>Knowing Steam, the version you get from them is probably not even patched for the infamous research bugs. And you don't wanna play in Dosbox if you have a better option. So just get openxcom. Trust me, I'm from the Internet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is best for fans of the original X-Com franchise.  It is basically a re-skin of the original X-com. This sequel is very difficult, even on easy setting. Finding the final alien on a map can literally take hours.  I hate to admit it but using a mod or a cheat is about the only way I have had any success in this game.

Brutal sequel to the renowned strategy classicLike the original, Terror from the Deep puts you into the shoes of the commander tasked with defending Earth from the alien threat and terrorist attacks.  Aliens have become even more menacing, there are quite a few of new huge underwater maps to explore as well as dozens of ways for your poor operatives to die there horribly. Terror from the Deep's overall gameplay mechanics and base building are mostly the same as the original's and even to this day still offer an impressive amount of depth and control over your operatives and their actions on the battlefield.ConsTftD does have some cons such as research tree bugs, sadly. Research tree bug is the most serious one and it's specifically worth reading about the Deep One bug.ConclusionAn old, but deep, atmospheric and complex strategy classic. If you haven't played X-Com classic games, you may want to start with the original as this game is significantly harder and more challengeing even on the easiest difficulty available.

-Quick Review-Welcome back to the early X-COM games, prepare yourself for no handholding, brutal difficulty for beginners, and much micromanaging to be had. X-COM: Terror From the Deep is a complex, difficult, turn-based, strategy/tactical game. Terror From the Deep was developed by Micro Prose and released in 1995.


World Map Sample 
Community Created Artwork for X-COM: Terror from the Deep
By: Atratzu

			I can't screenshot, so I'll just upload a few of those screenshots here. This is basically like XCOM: UFO Defense.. Just underwater, this is a sample of the world map.		


-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Generally speaking the story is the same as X-COM: UFO Defense; you're humanities last hope, as the head of the X-COM project, all of the major world governments are funding you to keep the world safe from the extraterrestrial invasion.The big difference about this game is that it's more polished and now you're fighting underwater and everything is underwater themed.


Opening Cinematic 
Community Created Artwork for X-COM: Terror from the Deep
By: Atratzu

			I can't believe this game was able to have cut-screens of this quality on a DOS system from the 1990's. It's really quite a feat.		


Gameplay: The controls are the same as X-COM: UFO Defense, so coming into the game, if you can successfully learn the first game, you can learn the second. The strategies do change somewhat, but fundamentally the game remains very similar to the first game.The most note worthy changes I noticed were sound related. (The community for the classic X-COM games is really outstanding: there have been mods created to help make these games easier/more-user-friendly to play. However, I don't like modding games right away... I prefer to just suck it up and learn how to play it in it's native format)


Battle Sample Screenshot

By: Atratzu

			I'm uploading these screenshots, because I can't get my screenshot to work. and I plan to reference them in my review. the purpose of this screenshot was to show the combat mode.		


Achievements: There are no steam achievements for these kind of games. Just playing this game unlocked a self proclaimed title called “I can play a retro video game, and not completely stink at it”. Price: X-COM Terror From the Deep is priced at $4.99 this is a fair asking price for a game that is quite old, and will easy pass my “dollar for every hour” played value system.Conclusion: I personally a adore playing classic video games, and I especially have a softspot for games that were played on PC DOS. I recommend this game to Gamers who enjoy: DOS games, strategy games, and retro video games.Other Related Reviews Reviews coming soonHere's the URL to see my review for X-COM: UFO DefenseHere's the URL to see my review for X-COM: ApocalypseHere's the URL to see my review for X-COM: Interceptor Here's the URL to see my review for X-COM: Enforcer ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

VAST Improvement Over UFO DefenseI played MANY hours on the Openxcom mod/remake, the review would ideally show around 100 hours.TFTD takes everything from UFO Defense and switches it up all over the place. Many people call the game an 'asset flip' because it looks and plays similarly to the first, but that is entirely false once you start digging into the game. The first aliens look like underwater Sectoids with flippers, but that's the only real similar alien between the two. The rules of the game are turned on its head here, Gauss weaponry (which is the equivalent to Lasers in UFO) is a direct upgrade to harpoon technology, is absolutely useless against certain aliens. This game requires you to think on your feet and find some way to deal with these aliens as they are the most deadly. No more laser firing squads on aliens miles away - you have to innovate. Gone are the days of everyone carrying the same weapon type.The only flaw I can find in the game besides all the game-breaking glitches (which are fixed in Openxcom *wink wink*) is the final mission. It's intended to be a test of endurance as you traverse a gigantic alien base, but its just so...boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love this game with all my heart. I played this back when it was released without having played its predecessor, UFO Enemy Unknown. I love the setting, the music, the atmosphere the funny B-movie aliens. It's rock hard, but that's half the fun. When I eventually played UFO Enemy Unknown, I realised that you couldn't choose to open doors without actually moving through them. So big a part of my strategy was this in XCOM TFTD that I couldn't get into the original at all. And I didn't find the atmosphere as compelling, either.Anyway, this might be one for the old DOS folks, but I'll still play this above more recent versions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game for over a year, back in the 1990s, and loved it.  Recently, MetalCanyon, from Slovenia, was playing through it on YouTube, and I had such a good time watching that I started it up again.  The graphics are simpler, but still fun, and it will run on just about any computer, with DOS Box or indirectly through Steam.All the early X-Com games would occasionally develop a buggy saved game and crash, but all I've ever needed to do is go back to an earlier save and move forward.Terror from the Deep is considerably more difficult than the first game.  The tentaculates are more a threat than the chrysalids, as the tnetaculates can reach all levels. We can't avoid them by flying (swimming, in this case).  And the wonderful smart missiles don't work on land.  At least the tentaculates aren't found on land, either.   There are maybe more little hiding places in Terror than in the first game.   It really pays to systematically search the map, keeping a lookout so an enemy doesn't sneak back into an area that's been searched.  It can take a while, but it beats endlessly searching the same areas again. This series does teach some basics of small unit tactics.The previous game is also well worth a look, with perhaps the most beautiful maps.  The next game, Apocalypse, has a real-time option that I prefer strongly, and MetalCanyon, who really likes turn-based, enjoyed it.This series is available for very little money, and there are good Let's Plays on YouTube.  So many people love this series that a seriously updated remake is doing well.  So I think you'll find the old series well worth a look and a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Underwater based instead of land based, with new guns, aliens, etc. Some things are obvious reskin/renames, some are new. Because of the derivative nature this game will always take a slight back seat to the original but it remains a classic in its own right, as the clausterphobic nature of deep sea tactical battles against unseen aliens is classically compelling.

												The most difficult game in existence. It took the gameplay of the original Enemy Unknown and cranked up the difficulty to 11. 1. Extemely difficult enemies appear when you are just into the Gauss phase (Lobstermen).2. Alien PSI ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥te. Really. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥te. PSI. Sorry, sorry: MC, not PSI. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥te.3. Tentaculats. Try to find those $*&^*#&$^%)(@#$*^ers hiding in a remote corner of a massive alien base. 4. Oh yes, MASSIVE ALIEN BASES. Don't go in without a flame thrower-eqivalent. The cabability of wiping out whole rooms with one projectile is a must. Pack a dozen of those.5. Two-part ship terror attacks. I found the ships to be very enjoyable. But VERY long. Oh, so long. Trying to find the last alien hiding in a remote corner (or in a crate that is unnaccessible except for a decently lobbed grenade) is akin to finding that last bloody tentaculat.Non-massochists need not apply. Perfect for Dwarf Fortress players though. Losing is a bread and butter of this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very similar to X-COM: UFO Defense, this takes place in the ocean and at coastal cities instead of the rural and urban landscapes of the first game. Also it is much harder than the original, apparently. So I guess if you liked UFO Defense, play this next since it's the sequel. :o			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you never play this, you must have been born in 90s. Ahhh, I still remember the time when I used to play this for hours on my trusty 486. Imagine it, a 100Mhz computer. Each time I press End Turn button, I waited breathlessly for 2 to 3 minutes!. Today, I can't even see the enemy movement. :). But still I remember the last battle in T'leth under the Gulf of Mexico.

												If  you liked the first X-COM, here's more of the same. The difficulty has been adjusted upwards to make you scream for mercy, and you're gonna want to reload your saved games an unimaginable number of time, but it is still great fun.

												So, remember how I said X-Com was great, but the sequels were basically the same game? Terror from the Deep was basically made in a month, for no money, by like two guys. It is pretty much a reskin of the original game. Somehow, it is twice as terrifying and twice as hard. It may be -too- hard. It's still a solid expansion to the original game, though. 4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sequel to X-com UFO defense felt a lot like a re-skinning of the orirginal. Was this a bad thing? Not really. The first one was so good they didn't really bother to fix something that wasn't broken. Add in a modified story and appropriate changes (basically swicth the empahsis to underwater/aquatic theme) and create larger alien bases. Pretty cool. The one gripe is that sometimes the last weak alien will play hide and seek in their base, dragging out an otherwise finished mission.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This were the first XCOM I played and the only title of the franchise I never managed to finish.I played many hours in my childhood with my sisters, but we never managed to win (well we never watched the graphs) So I started the game again on Beginner because I just wanted to clear the Game for the first time in my life.  The first two times were a failure.The first time I managed to savescumm through the battlescape but got wrecked in the End because I didn't researched the better baraccudas. So in the end I couldn't Interecept the ufos anymore.The second time I started in the Mediterrean Sea and cleared everything in my vicinity but the Aliens decided to havoc the pacific ocean where i couldn't Intercept and did my final attempt at the colony with only sonic pistols and alien grenades researched. Result: Lost my Triton and 10(more or less Brave[Why you Andy?? Why??! ]) Men plus one Vehicle.Didn't beat it yet, but the day will come where I will free the sea of the alien menace.( XCOM: Ufo Defense + XCOM Enemy Unknown with Enemy Within are cleared already several times)I really do like the Underwater setting and as a kiddo I didn't even knew this were a sequel to XCOM: Ufo Defense.I would like to fail at the attempt, to finish this game several times more 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most legendary turn based strategy games ever.Bought this on cd-rom back when it came out and my adolescent mind was hooked. Saving the world from the aliens isn't the most original idea, but back then it was pretty new to computer games. In this time we went under the sea... a lot of people, like myself, probably bought if for the nostalgia value, but I'd recommend this also the younger players to see how great gameplay and (back then) original ideas made a game addictive. The graphics and sound are of course from yesteryear, but the game experience itself and the story is great.Not like some of the later X-COM games that came that had nothing to do with turned based strategy and were just riding off the name. Pathetic I'd say.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty awesome, there's lots to do, enemy ships and bases require strategy to take them down, great research, but be aware there are some bugs that can screw it up for you. Basically the research needs to be done in specific order, otherwise you'll miss important things and possibly won;t be able to finish it.The research bugs aside, the game has great everything, music, acceptable graphics even so many years after being made, The aliens can attack your base so don't forget base defence.The only thing I can as against the game is that once you start it and get into it, it's very difficult to stop ...

												The Sequal to X-com: UFO Defence or ""UFO: Enemy Unknown"" as named in the UK. It starts off showing what happened after you destroyed the alien base and that they had a plan up their sleeve, firing off a pod of somekind into the sea where new under-water aliens now appear.A few problems I have with this is most likely a problem with the game or dosbox because sometimes the sound comes out wrong. However for gameplay like the first game I swear the aliens have a far better vision and can see in the dark, even though people have claimed in walkthroughs that they can't and don't have better vision.Honestly, I stll love this game though. The environments are quite creepy with new and terrorfying (sometimes comical) undersea aliens. You also research new types of submarines, even those that fly out of water to track UFOs. The bases I find are more difficult than the first game and more challenging. That's all I have to say, game on :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FINALLYFinally besides the PS1 version there is a Working WINDOWS compatible version of this game. With Windows 7 i experienced no super-fast gameplay problems like other versions (so there's no need to underclock your processor to dangerously low levels), and all of the original videos and game ran fine without any crashes or freezes or superfast scroll speed problems like other versions.The in-game timer ticks at ORIGINAL speeds and its finally...FINALLY working 99% like the original. (see below for the minor hiccup)Either play it here on Steam, or on Ps1  these are the two, best versions.The only one hickup i found on this version, is that it changes the Mouse Speed on your system to default setting, when i normally run mine 3-4 notches faster, so be sure to correct your mouse speed after playing this.

												I am little torn with this review, as I don't want to give Terror From the Deep a bad review. But in the black-and-white rating system I must give it a thumb down. It is not that the game is not good, it is because the game is unnecessary hard on places it shouldn't be. Also we must remember that TFD is always compared to its predecessor Ufo Defence, which is The Game of its genre, even over 20 years after its debut.The TFD is basically a somewhat tweaked Ufo Defence with all the loved features and ""hated"" enemy arch-types. But it also has one of the most hated missions ever: the attacks on ships. These two-level missions have a lot of places for the aliens to hide and I mean hide. It hasn't been one or two times to spend hours to snoop every crank and closet on a ship, only to find that there is another level waiting you to scrutine it as thoroughly. Second mission type with same flaw is the Alien Base assault missions. First you need to infiltrate an elevator with brute force (seriously, you need a lot of firepower if you want to succeed at all and even that can turn against you) facing the most fearsome enemies there is. Then your survivors face another level with lots of places to be ambushed and an enemy that can withstand enormous amounts of firepower (the infiltration is the key to success here). Honestly, two mission types with two levels is too much of a grind. It doesn't need to be a walk in the park, but neither a climb to K2 mountain.One huge flaw (at least in the original cd-version) was in the technology research. You had to research the vital research in just the right order or else you were stuck. This happened to me more than once back in the days, when I had assaulted the 15th alien base with my pajamas, because I did the research in the wrong order. Another flaw in here is that if you don't manage to capture certain alien in certain timeframe, it becomes almost impossible to obtain it ever again. It could be only couple of mission where you have the chance to capture it and it is vital for your research. Don't know if that has been resolved for this one, but I am not taking any chances ever again.Also I dislike the games ending. It was really anti-climatic after brutally beating the game for two weeks, grinding missions as I concentrated all my efforts on fast-researching the final technologies. For the last minute I waited somekind of Cthulhu-class monster to appear, but nothing like that happened.I recommend this game to those enthusiastic Ufo Defence players who want to experience something little different but still the same. But be warned, it won't be pretty. I myself won't be touching this game for a long, long time and rather play the Ufo Defence over and over again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So if for some wild reason, you’re reading my reviews in order, Terror From the Deep (TFD for brevity) is the second stop in my walk down X-Com classics lane.Although there were a few years between the original UFO Defense and TFD, the game feels largely the same. I would say it was more of an expansion pack than a new title. Again, the port is phenomenal. Sounds are actually more consistent than the original, and all the scaling and UI interactions are perfect and functional. And again, much like the port being equally as good, the game itself is just not doing it for me as a newcomer to the X-Com franchise. Now I’m sure pro alien fighters will tell you all the groundbreaking improvements TFD brought to the the table, but to me it felt like the exact same game migrated into the oceans. As the name implies, the aliens are from the ocean rather than space. In place of interceptor fighters, one dispatches interceptor subs. The one good thing is that from my experience with UFO Defense I was able to get into the actual combat faster; sadly that combat was largely the same and just as frustrating to me fighting with the interface. If you’d like to learn a bit more about my qualms with the way the game plays then just check out my review of the original game.My conclusion for X-Com number two remains the same: newcomers to the franchise will be frustrated and put off but those with childhood memories of the game will find this port to be gorgeous.

												Despite only getting into X-com after playing EU, I instantly fell in love with UFO defense. The gameplay is challenging and rewarding, although it is very clunky. I didn't realise how much the atmposphere meant to me until I played this game. TFTDs music is nothing short of horrible. Remember the music that played before a terror mission in UFO? It was just what you needed to get hyped before the mission started. In this game the music sounds like a 1950s low budget horror film. The starting items are confusing as all hell, I mean what is the difference between a dart gun and a harpoon gun? What does a partical disturbance grenade do and how does it differentiate from a magna-blast grenade?!? In UFO defense you could easily understand an items function by looking at its name. It's due to stuff like confusing names and a game breaking tech tree (researching projects in the wrong order can render the game unfinishable) that you will almost certainly have to rely on a guide if you don't want to restart this game constantly. This isn't even taking into account how difficult the game is which oddly enough is one of the few things that they did right. After getting a hang of the basics and researching some good gear, UFO defense got very easy. The game also feels a lot buggier. I occasionally see a 3 tile long river just floating in the blackness outside the map. Terror missions seem to take place in a village located in bizzaro land where the houses are built into the side of never ending hills. There are 1 tile wide tunnels dotted around the map that exist for no other purpose than to make the mission harder.The only postive thing I can say about this game is that the combat feels a lot better and is more challenging. However I think it sacrificed too much for it.In conclusion, just play UFO defense with mods. The atmosphere as a whole is better and the bugs aren't game breaking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personally, this games feels more like an expansion pack rather than a true sequel. First almost everything is just a clone from the previous game. Which really ruins it as a sequel. Second this much harder and more tedious than the previous game. Mainly for the fact this game is picky on which aliens you have to stun and what you have get in order to research something. Also, this game has some seriously flaws. First the Gauss tank has a problem with ammunition. Second a lot of weapons are BS as they can only work underwater, and as well as the flight feature of the magnetic ion armor. Finally, a lot of these missions are so tedious. Especially the two-part ship missions. Anyway, unless you want a super challenging game or are masochist. I did beat this game on superhuman, but it was the ultimate test of my patience.

												Terror from the Deep on Steam.  Well it uses DosBox but has it configured better than others, but not by much.  No keyboard support, a magical 3 or so frames per sec on the geoscape, and terrible sound syncing in missions.  Alt tabbing is risky.  I've had a crash or two.  I should mention I'm playing on Windows 8.With all that said this version of the game is playable and is probably the most playable one I've seen on new systems, but once you're playing with all those negatives, you're actually playing Terror from the Deep which is a horrid sequal to a great game.  Giant maps on small ships?  Slow movement?  Low accuracy, low ammo, and panicks?  You bet!  (This gun does not fire outside of water!)  Then why let me equip it?!  Have 2+ people standing close together?  Enjoy getting grenaded on your first mission.Until the Open Xcom boys actually support Terror from the Deep you're better off avoiding this one, and its very understandable why they wouldn't want to waste their time on it.

												X-COM is remembered by many old-school gamers as the uber-difficult, tactic-heavy, turn-based strategy game of earth's defense against aliens.While it is still all of these things, it is very difficult to play this game today when there exists the new X-COM games with modern day conveniences. If you've played this game before, it may still get a playthrough thanks to nostalgia. However, if you have never played this game before, it is doubtful that you will both understand how to play this game, nor find it worthwhile to actually play through it.While it may not really have stood the test of time to be playable to the masses, it is a title that will always be remembered by those who enjoyed it many years ago.4/10 ""Not worth playing today""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												X-Com: Terror From the Deep is one of those old games that has really bunch of really nice systems for its time that don't really add up to a great complete game. I personally love it, but for most people this game is going to be an exercise in beating your head against a brick wall and trying desperately to achieve results.The combat is exceptionally difficult, research and development takes a very long time, and everything relies so heavily on randomized elements of the game that it is literally impossible to beat the game in most play throughs. Generally your budding organization will get wiped out before it gets very far into establishing itself at all.You play this game to challenge yourself and see how far you can get before the systems in play destroy you. It's a game you usually play to see how far you can get before you die, but without the kind of self-awareness that modern games in that vein have developed over the years.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here is my perspective of this game, It's garbage. There is literally nothing to do at all, and there is no learning curve at all. Basically you choose a difficulty, then the game tells you to build a base. THAT'S IT! It doesn't tell you how to build a base and it doesn't tell you what you need to build a base, it just says BUILD A BASE!!! I am sure that if you want to find some third-party website to do some reading, you can spend an hour and a half reading and learning how to play this garbage dump of a game, or you could just take your license of this game, throw it out of an airplane, use it to start a campfire to keep you warm, wipe your♥♥♥♥♥with it, etc. and you could get more use out of this waste of ""gaming"" than if you actually played it. 10/10 DON'T PLAY THIS GAME, UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE 5 BUCKS LESS RICH AND BORED AND CONFUSED.

												I would not recommend this game not even to the big fans of the first x-com ufo defense (as I am).This Terror from the deep just brings difficulty to an insane level, at the point that is simply impossible to play it without a savage use of save and reload. Myself, I can finish the original x-com with any difficulty level, with few if no reloading at all: the game is very punishing, but if you start to know the kind of maps, of enemies, how to dispose your men, which equipment to use, how to snipe from afar and eventually destroy covers... There is a lot of tricks and knowledge to apply in an x-com game... But in this one...Unfortunately, TFTD just bring everything to frustration, ruining the perfect balance and gameplay (which was already difficult to be honest) of its predecessor. Aliens have so much life and such accuracy, and could hide for rounds behind a sea weed because of some graphic bug before you find them, or be invisible behind a cactus without any of your 14 men realizing anything untill a granade drops killing everybody: such things might happen also in the original xcom (which in the end is the very same game), but rarely not every time in every single map. It is really embarassing how they got worse every single aspect of this game, exacerbating the defects of x-com without adding any improvement at all and making it look more confusing and clumsy.So, whoever you are, a gamer that does wants to discover this epic serie or a hardcore gamer looking for a challange, just skip this and play the original x-com. If after masterying it and finishing it you will still want more you can give this terror from the deep a try, but you will probably go back to the original, which is really better in every single aspect, from gameplay to music and graphics.

												I love this series, but pick up X-Com, UFO Defense for the original feel or XCOM: Enemey Unknown for the updated play. Terror from the deep has fewer enemy types, less intereseting technology, and a less cohesive story than the original X-Com. There are a lot of game-ending bugs as well. For example, if you research things in the wrong order, you can't get a certain technology you need to move forward. Overall, this is just a sloppy art skin slapped on the original. Pass on this, even if you're a hardcore fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me get started by saying that I'm not only going to point out the bad parts and bash it a round.Anyway so lets begin.....Now I've played the X-com: Enemy Unkown although it was not the first I enjoyed it and to my stupidity I tried basing XCOM around it, knowing I was wrong I bought this one.....Now this game can be fun once you get into it but it's difficult to get around, such as they don't give you a tutorial all that they do is put you into the game with a cut scene, I found this difficult to do - infact due to this I had to restart many times.So after that I gave up on it, I may come back to it in the future and play it but untill then I don't know what to do with it.Also if you enjoy old games or looking for a XCOM game got either this one or the Enemy unkown.

												This Game is one of the best ever!  I remember my first expirience with XCOM.  A buddy and I came acrross a a Demo disk for TFTD (Terror from the Deap).  It was 1 mission which we played over and over on night till we understood the game.  It quickly became a must have and was purchased (DOS).  After playing it what what seems to be several months I finally beat it and moved on to the Original XCOM Enenmy Unknown which was the first of the series.  TFTD is my favoirite of the two but I'm sure thats just because it was my first XCOM experience.  I had been using DOS BOX to play them long before I found them on steam.  When I saw them I was so excieted because I thought Steam had them recoded them to work in the later versions of windows.  I was a little disapointed to find out that I payed for something I already had since I had already discovered how to set them up in DOSBox.  Steam does take the trail and error out of setting up the DOSbox and getting all the sound and stuff working so I still Recomend buying them when they go on special, especially if you want all the Games.  Almost 20 years later I can still play XCOM now I find myself explaining to my wife and child why this game is still better that the newly released XCOM games (which I own and have beeten) nothing made these days takes the same kind of time and effort to beat.  Back in the Day we would buy a game for $30-$50 and have it take almost a year to beat.  No $50-$60 buys you a game you can complete in 20 hours or less of play. :-(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TFTD can be thought of as X-COM: Hardcore. This game, simply put, does not screw around. It takes everything about the first game and makes it meaner, tougher, and in more than a few cases, more likely to make you change your pants. This game is rare in that it manages to take a turn based tactical game and make the player both heavily involved and COMPLETELY PARANOID. Recall those 3P's I mentioned in my X-COM review? You'll need them again, and even moreso. The mechanics of the game are tougher. You generally have less ammo than in UFO Defense, and will constantly be scrounging for clips. However, the advent of the long awaited melee weapons can help solve some of those woes. Fight on land or in the ocean to take down threats new and ancient. Watch for monsters ranging from aggressive nautiluses to bipedal lobsters to brain-eating...brain jellyfish. You'll need all your wits, tactical acumen, and nerve to deal with the horrors waiting for you below the sea. Don't go in the water...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a fan of the original x-com game, this is a must have. There are a few drawbacks, such as the research bugs that were introduced when they made the tech tree extremely complex compared to the first one, and very late game even superhuman difficulty isn't as difficult as in the original.Though if you are craving difficulty, try to survive the start of this game on superhuman. it's way worse than the original.TFTD is basically a standalone expansion pack, and for the price you can pick it up on steam for, it really is worth it. 5/5 for stellar gameplay across the board			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												They need to give me something between yes this game is good and no this game sucks.  Fact is, Terror from the Deep is good.  Is it as good as UFO Defense?  Unfortunately, no it isn't.  While labeled as a sequel, this would be more accurately described as an expasion or perhaps even a mod.  Practically a reskin, while there are new enemies and new weapons and bigger maps and all that jazz, if you look past the surface similarities, not too much has changed between this first game and the second.  I'd even go so far as to say that the changes in map size make the game more annoying if anything, since now hunting down that last alien can be a real trial in map awareness.If you liked the first game a lot I'd recommend getting this on a deal.  If you didn't, you should probably pass.  If you've never played either of them, go check out UFO Defense and come back - between the two UFO is the stronger title, and they're more or less functionally identical.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A wonderful, sometimes underrated, sometimes not strategy game.  Disturbing and compelling.  The game shines in the underwater areas, the cool alien subs and interesting alien technology.Use Xcom Util to fix the game-breaking bugs.  I never cheat, but this tool allows you to.  I also always play ""ironman"", so no save-reloading, and I always play on the hardest difficulty.  My personal tip for enjoying this game is to skip (arrive, but leave immediately) the cruise-ship missions unless you've got a lot of time.  You will lose score (not always a bad thing as the game gets harder the better you do), but better than losing your sanity, do well in other missions, and you can beat the game even when you skip them. Pro-tip:  Buy/build submersible weapon systems, use them as scouts, snipe from afar.An interesting relic from a long time ago, and one of my favourite games of all time.  I don't think my children would ever understand this though, haha.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												a sequel to one of the best games ever made and it dose improve on a few things like the AI is better and the lvls are bigger it has a lot of new aliens most of witch our based on Cthulhu Mythos and this one is a lot harder then the first and most of the maps take place under water witch is cool and they are maps on the surface the only time your on the surface is when the aliens attack a port a ship or an island and theres a lot of new items in the game but most of them work very much like items in the first one and thats the biggst problem with TFD it lacks innovation the gameplay is very much the same and a lot of the aliens are much like the ones in the first and they are a few bugs but this is still a great game cause its the Xcom i love so much so if your like me and love the first one you should get this			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A wonderful, sometimes underrated, sometimes not strategy game.  Disturbing and compelling.  The game shines in the underwater areas, the cool alien subs and interesting alien technology.Use Xcom Util to fix the game-breaking bugs.  I never cheat, but this tool allows you to.  I also always play ""ironman"", so no save-reloading, and I always play on the hardest difficulty.  My personal tip for enjoying this game is to skip (arrive, but leave immediately) the cruise-ship missions unless you've got a lot of time.  You will lose score (not always a bad thing as the game gets harder the better you do), but better than losing your sanity, do well in other missions, and you can beat the game even when you skip them. Pro-tip:  Buy/build submersible weapon systems, use them as scouts, snipe from afar.An interesting relic from a long time ago, and one of my favourite games of all time.  I don't think my children would ever understand this though, haha.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So everyone knows that it's UFO:Enemy Unknown's less popular little sibling, but it's still a great game in it's own right. Especially with the XcomUtil add-ons. It's a lot harder than UFO:EU and a  lot buggier as well. I got stuck on the last mission, on the second level my soldiers materialised but their weapons were scatttered all over the area... must have been an overflow bug but it took me almost 10 turns to collect all my weapons back up. Another 170-odd hours of my life well spent!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love Xcom or UFO - Enemy Unknown. And I do love Terror From The Deep, even if it's the only Xcom I've never played to the end. The new missions like onboard of ships or on coastal cities were a good addition. The music was creepy and it always reminded me of some stories of Jules Verne.The only things I didn't like were the outfits and faces of the aquanauts. It's the year 2050 and they run around in suits and look like it's 1889.If you like the original Xcom (UFO) and never played this one, give it a try. It's a little harder like its predecessor. But fun, too.09/10 would try to build submarine base on land again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What's there to say?  This is, to my mind, one of the ultimate sequels in gaming history.  It takes the gameplay of the original, but improves the AI, changes the gameplay just enough to keep things fresh, and builds on the original strengths.Though many criticise it for being too similar, I find this to be a strength.  If you played the original, it added a more atmospheric and darker story, with maps and creatures pulled from the nightmares of H.P. Lovecraft.  Whereas the original was 100% gameplay addiction, this one added supense through music, setting (underwater...  creepy), and harder difficulty, bringing a natural next ""phase"" to the human war on the alien menace.Though it is now not as accessible as current renditions such as XCOM or Xenonauts, it has a unique setting and compelling gameplay that keeps me coming back 20 years later.Runs well on modern systems via DosBox (included in Steam version).

												Humanity had thought that they had won the war against the aliens in X-COM: UFO Defense, but they were wrong, so very wrong....Now a new and even more dangerous alien threat has awoken in the murky depths of the sea and now it is up to the Aquanauts, a group that has the same mission as the X-COM group but does it underwater as well as on land, to stop the aliens from taking over the world, or destroying it.You will be facing some of the most disturbing and dangerous enemies ever, including one that is a human brain that has been placed in a metallic body and uses the screams from the brain as a very VERY deadly sonic weapon along with creatures not unlike the Deep Ones and more from H.P. Lovecraft's stories.Are you ready to descend into the depths and face the aliens?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The original X-COM games may be old but they are still some of the best turn-based  squad-level combat games ever made. In many ways X-COM: TFTD is a remake of the first game, with some refinements and improvements thrown in. Even with its flaws it is still a true classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite the brutal, unforgiving difficulty (even on ""Beginner"") and occasionally ludicrous setting, this is classic X-COM at its best. The undersea tactical combat is nail-biting, the enemy AI is much trickier than in the first game, and the end-game even has an unexpected cameo. I'm not generally a fan of either massive strategy games or tactics combat games, but I've loved this game ever since I first played it in the '90s.Thankfully, the Steam Terror From The Deep bundles the now-completely-useless Windows 95 version with a custom DOSBox install of the original DOS version. This means if you don't like the up-rez filter or the emulated sound device used, you can change them just by editing a text file. Oh, and this is the CD-ROM version, with the FMV intro. Maybe that's not a huge deal for some, but it's important for folks like me who like to get complete versions of old games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great sennsation of responsibilities cause this game to be a great (and tense) experience, as you learn how to play and develop your own assault strategies as you see YOUR WHOLE SQUAD DYING WITH A SINGLE GRENADE. In one turn. Every movement, every, armor, every research, every corner to be looked at decides the fate of your entire game.The cruelty of the AI (on all difficulties) makes this game addicting and with high replay value, just like Dark Souls. You have to be smart and know exactly what you are doing, else, one-shot-kills and molecular controls will get your squad completely decimated.Together with it's predecessor, the best strategy series I've ever played. Not to be compared with the ""remake"" XCom Enemy Unknown. Side-by-side the most recent port looks like ""Barbie's goes to the beach"", compared to the epicness of the old-school DOS unforgiving destroyer of strategies. One shot, one kill, you lose, you load.The best ambience I've ever seen so far with MIDI music!Warning: Steep learning curve, may seem impossible to play and unfair on the first hours.Actually, it IS unfair! xDThat's the X-Com way to be epic!God bless you guys, may your homes be filled with the peace of Jesus Christ, his Son.

												This game is so awesome. I remember sitting down and watching my Dad play this game for hours when I was little. I barely played it at the time but I always wanted to play it again. Now I have the chance. I purchased it for $4.99, which is a complete and utter steal. This game is worth at least 10x that amount. Graphics are nothing epic, pretty basic and simple, which is okay with me. I like simplicity. The gameplay itself is really smooth, no lag of any sort, and so far I have yet to experience a bug/glitch. Of course every game has some, no game, like a person, is perfect, but I've been fortunate to never have a bad experience with this game. The worst I've had is reloading the game here and there because one of my Aquanauts died. Other than that, it's smooth sailing. Purchase this game and let the enjoyment begin, you will not regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												XCom TftD brings alot to the table for its age. This game revolves around turn based tactical combat during encounters and an global management system. There is a currency system in game and base layout/management. Much like the classic XCom but adds underwater scenarios and special equipment respectively.Nothing beats that feeling when you prepare your crews and set up base in anticipation of detecting your first UFO on radar. When it happens you won't forget that rush when you attempt to down your first UFO and not to mention the threatening dread and creepfactor when you deploy to examine the crash site.While the graphics are dated there's something about XCom and TftD that really gets it right in so many aspects. Once you get used to research chains, selling crafted equipment and navigating the interface it won't seem so overwhelming. Once you are familiarized with the AI's nasty little tricks and how to manage your team's items and movement XCom really reveals it's charm. With little need for powerful hardware and a save feature available at any time there's huge casual replay values. I have yet to complete this version of the game, it can be extremely difficult but I like the expanded items and new locations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is a palette swap of Ufo Enemy Unknown served by 3 headed dragon waiter with no mercy.If you feel like getting your a** handed to you the nostalgic way.
