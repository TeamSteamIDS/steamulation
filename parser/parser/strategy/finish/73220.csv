Posted: April 2, 2015
												This game is hands down the best game in the Supreme Ruler series along with 2020... but it is still kind of bad.First off, everything that happens is completely historically railroaded. No, I am not talking about who wins what, but more, all the wars are scripted (at least, I have yet to see a non-scripted war). For example, East and West Germany could be in an arms race for so long, with tons of British and USA troops in the West, and Soviets in the East. But what happens? Nothing. They are extremely hostile but nope, no war. It may seem logical, but it gets very boring. Especially knowing the AI will never intervene, and there cannot be a WW3. It makes the spheres system useless.Also, a WW3 is nearly IMPOSSIBLE, or maybe it is impossible. One worry about the Korean and Vietnam wars in real life was that the wars would drag the Warsaw Pact into all out war with NATO. However, when the Korean war starts, the USA says ""lel ♥♥♥♥ you guys"" and sits and watches South Korea get steamrolled. Ouch. And then there is Vietnam. The North starts by making large gains on French Indochina, but the French AI sends units by the hundreds over to Vietnam from Europe, and starts steamrolling through the Northern rebels. Now with its ideological enemy creeping towards its borders, China does.... nothing. Units can engage without being at war, and China usually has access through North Vietnam, but they do nothing. In fact, they don't even supply the Vietnamese with weapons, fuel... ANYTHING! They just sit and watch the Capitalists win.And however the AI in this game is likely the best out of any Supreme Ruler hands down, it just doesn't work properly. For example, say you're USA, and you're trying to get Spain to join NATO. Well, they may have super friendly relations, but they're not even under your influence at ALL. In real life, the USA would supply countries with weaponry, and offer protection, and same with the USSR, but in this game you must keep pouring billions into the AI's treasury before they'll begin accepting deals. And once they do start accepting deals as simple as free trade, you need to offer them ALL the diplomatic treaties before they even start to like you. Then, once you are allied with them, only then do they start to slowly go into your sphere. (Unless you are the AI, with their diplomatic voodoo) But this makes no sense, right? I mean, playing as the USA, you end up allied to 40 different nations just because you wanted them in your influence, meanwhile, the rest of NATO aren't allied with eachother at all. Same thing goes for the Warsaw Pact. It is simply just nonsense.And then there is the economy... oh god. The ways to make money in this game are the most gamey and unrealistic ways to make money ever. And the only nations that don't need ultra gamey and exploitive actions to make money are : USA, USSR, China, UK, India, and I think that is it. It is quite dumb that these nations always have their pockets filled with money whilst other nations fill up with uncontrollable amounts of debt. Making money shouldn't rely on being one of few lucky nations who never run out of money or mass producing one resource. In Victoria 2, if you focus all your production, on, let's say, machine parts, it may end very poorly. The massive amounts of machine parts you produce may cause them to become nearly worthless, and your factories may hardly scrape by, or a massive economic collapse in the British Empire may lose one of the biggest buyers of your machine parts and your factories will go bankrupt and close. It really immerses you in the economics of the game. In this game, you feel completely disconnected with the economics as all you need to do is spam produce one resource and you're set with tons of cash. It's really dissapointing and boring.PROS-Decent interface-Very nice cold war map-Nations being released worldwide-Wars are fun-Nuclear wars are more fun-Small border clashes may sometimes occur between hostile nationsCONS-No feeling of competiton between the USSR and USA-AI does not intervene in wars such as Korea or Vietnam, making them extremely predictable and boring-Sphere system does nothing but make nations hate eachother-""Flashpoint tension"" system doesn't do anything, as the AI seems incapable of declaring a non-scripted war-Economy is extremely gamey, uninteresting, and unrealistic-Diplomacy AI is horrendous-Advisors that will start making changes to your nation that you don't want and may not realize-World War 3 is impossible in the first place, which takes most of the fun out of the game (if it is not, correct me)-After everything, this is still a game about world conquest, which is not why I bought this-Same 3 minute soundtrack, looping over, and over, and over, and over and over.....If I had to score this, I would give it a 6/10. It is a kinda fun game, but many of the issues in it make the game dull and uninteresting at times. I really did expect more from a game with Paradox Interactive as the publisher, and knowing their policy of publishing a game, it really seems like Paradox swept this one under the rug. At this price of $11 it is alright to buy, but if you haven't already, buy Victoria 2 instead.			",82,6,2,10,39,0,31

												Cold War takes nearly every element from 2020 and improves it ten fold. The graphics are still somewhat primitive but improved greatly and it almost has a charm to it. The diplomatic elements are still some of the best in strategy games but still lacks some features that could make it the best. Military wise its fun and easy to figure out and the new Merchant marine makes it ten times easier to move troops globally and invade island nations. The economic part of the game is time consuming but makes you think about what you need to make it work well.The interface for managing everything is organised but can be confusing with some elements hidden behind too many other interfaces making it a maze to figure something simple out.The Cold War campaign is well organised with the Atomic and Space races and the many conflicts and problems are there that were present in the 1950s,60s,70s and 80s.The Sandbox mode is also still fun to play and a healthy mod scene makes it enjoyable to try different modes and scenarios.Overall this game is definatly worth your time and money if you into this genre.

												This game is very complex, and it takes a lot to get into it. It's a good game, but hard to recommend unless you really enjoy stratagy games. My intrest in the cold war was really all that kept me playing past the 5 hour mark, but now I'm glad that I stuck with it. It's not a game that I play often, but overall, I do enjoy the game, and it was worth the $30 or so dollars I paid for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ricks Review:Summary:Gameplay: 8/10 - Game revolves around Conflict and Wars, there is little indepth analysis of how the wars start, end etc. There is barely any form of politics or depth to the scenarios. I do agree that the wars are fun and awesome, but I wish there was a way for the wars to matter except for resources. Politics: 3/10 - The only form of politics available is choosing whether you're Liberal, Neutral or Conservative, which barely matters in game (that I've noticed). In my opinion and experience, this is all the politics the game provides, yes you debate the economy and build stuff, but that is pointless if you cannot change how they work or emphasise your opinion on it. Diplomacy: 5/10 - There is a obvious diplomacy in the game where you can negotiate treaties with other countries (alliances, free trade etc.) or buy units, designs, technology or resources from them. However it feels bland and near pointless to negotiate an alliance with other nations if they aren't going to help you (yes an unjustified war should not be supported)Economy: 7/10 - The money side of the economy is decent, trading resources, collecting taxes, DONE. But the building structures side of the economy (mines, labs etc.) makes your country feel too socialist for many players to accept. It would be a nice feature if your citizens (depending on the economy and other issues) would setup their own businesses, buildings etc. like mines or power plants which have a small toll onto the nations economy compared to state construction. I am not debating the rights and wrongs of a pure socialist society, but there needs to be an acceptance for capitalists or businesses to setup like in many countries today, and would give a reason for corporate taxes to accept.Audio: 8/10 - Good music and sounds which fit each need.Story: 2/10 - Basic, generic World War 3 scenario where the worlds resources start becoming few and country paranoia and xenophobia start turning into armed conflicts across the globe. But it is still very basic and generic, yet acceptable for a strategy-simulation.Multiplayer: N/A - Never tried the multiplayer as no one will play it with me :'(. So I cannot comment on its performance, capaibilities or how well it does.UI: 7/10 - Blocky and ugly for such an advanced and modern game, yet it provides the necessaries for it to work.Please Note:Good Conflict simulator - Not a political simulatorGeneric story which is worth no looking atVery indepth view of a socialist paradise			",38,10,0,7,39,1,22

												The A.I is incredibly stupid, diplomacy is useless with a stupid A.I. The game runs very slowly even if your system exceeds the requirements and will start to stutter and lags as the A.I build increasing number of units. The game is very buggy and is not very streamlined. The idea looks good on paper and this game has a lot of potential. The game feels like it's still in beta stage. You will spend most of your time being frustrated at all the bugs and the stuttering plus the stupid A.I.			",16,6,0,9,14,0,19

												I've sunk 140 hours in this game and let me tell you it's painfully slow to progress, It's a game you play in the background while playing a more involving game.  Originally three times the price when it first came out, it's ambitious but fails to deliver, with parts of the unser interface missing, no tutorial and AI that makes no sense and does the same things every time I played through.  The game focuses on the military, but even that is buggy.  There isn't much in terms of a soundtrack, with me hearing the same 3 minute track of music looped throughout the game.  More of a frustrating struggle than a challenging strategy game.			",44,7,0,7,23,0,24

												This is an excellent Grand Strategy game for history enthusiasts and others. The game's worth exceeds its asking price price of only $9.99 (at the time of writing this review), and is refreshing strategy game since most war games generally skip over the Cold War era. Another plus about this game is that it can run on almost any computer that you would have today because it does not have these amazing, hyper-realistic, 3D graphics that everybody seems to need in 2014. If you are looking for a new Grand Strategy game to play, don't want to spend too much, or just are sick of the World War II, Modern, and want a recent-alternate-history game, this is the one for you!

												Supreme Ruler Cold War is a good RTS that has players think on a much larger scale. It is not simply build units abd attack the enemy, the player has to worry about how other nations may see them. You controll everything from your economy to your army, however you will find your self autoing much of this. The Ai in the game is well...bad to say the least, within a few games you will fing it not very hard at all. The online community is practically gone although you can still find the odd game or two.All in all it is a good game that you can spend hours on.			",92,2,1,17,24,1,62

												The gameplay is interesting and is fun managing the economy and building a personal empire but I find that the game has much more potential but was left behind by the developers who focused on making similar clones of this game whilst not improving this game. The AI is initially capable but soon looses and edge, the AI also keep building units which cause the game to lag heavily later one and which cripple the economy of the AI countries and political interactions between AI countries are weak and seem to be non visual. Even without the lag the AI is no balanced match for the player either being too easy or too hard.Another problem with the game is the multiplayer which is not very stable and will frequently desync even on a wired lan. The lack of online services is excusable but the flaws which remain in the base local multiplayer game are game ruining.The lack of fixes from the developers for the issues cripples the enjoyment of the game and makes the interest in the game dwindle fast. I have played enough of the game to come to the conclusion that it is fun to play but was hardly finished and not fun to play. So my recommendation is not to play the game unless miraculously the inherent bugs are worked out			",72,5,3,9,17,0,19

												Maybe i'm just weird but this game can have me in a trance for hours micromanaging every little aspect of my campaign to conquer the globe... sometimes through proxy wars, maybe a backdoor deal here and there, and when all else fails I find myself mass producing tanks and rolololing over the various nation states of the cold war world. I never fail to laugh when north korea manages to win the korean war in 1950s sometimes they lose sometimes not, but either way one korea will remain and there will be no 38th parallel line. All in all I find myself understanding how they might've thought during the cold war.. the superpowers that is.. I stockpile all these nukes but because of my progress as the soviet union or USA or anyone really I am always too afraid to use them... but that doesn't stop me from saving and then nuking everything anyway and then reloading when I am ready to seriously continue or I can attempt to rebuild from post nuclear war..

												So, it takes a while to get accustomed to the mechanics as is par for paradox titles, but I have to say that battlegoat did a fine job with this massive title. These paradox games are so appealing to me because they double as a history lesson; if you aren't playing them with another window open to wikipedia - and youtube, you're doing it wrong ! :PThere are some menus and info that is impossible or difficult to discern and so far I have spent most of my time learning the game rather than playing it, also I've mostly confined myself to sanbox mode so cannot comment on the 'missions' it might have, but I do look forward to playing them out in the future too. All in all this game is captivating if you enjoy other paradox titles, it is an excellent game to run, for example, after playing Hearts of Iron III. It's not perfect, but it's good. I got this on sale for less than $5 and I feel like I ripped the publisher off. Thanks steam !!! ;D(( people who enjoy these but feel combat is weak can suppliment with playing WoWs or WoWp or Company of Heros, etc to get themselves onto the front lines and take a break from the overlording, long-term aspects of the period ;))Take the time to learn about other nations history, pay attention to your economy (or hand it off to a minister and hold onto your butts) !

												The game doesn't give you  a tutorial on how to play so its up to you to figure out how to build your economy if you're playing an undeveloped nation. Also, creating units is difficult and all the wars are scripted with a similar outcome. I haven't played the other Supreme ruler games and after playing this one, I don't plan to. Overall, The time frame for the game is good however I cannot grasp the game and my gametime shows it. Its not like the other Paradox games at all. If you want a grand strategy game, choose either Victoria 2 or for a 20th century timeframe, Darkest Hour as it is very cheap, easy to learn and has serveral mods.			",50,11,1,7,25,0,15

												If you've played SR 2020 or if you are looking for a good strategic simulation that lets you get at just about every aspect of macro-management then this is a good one. There's a bit of a learning curve though, but once you get through the concepts and the management paradigm, it is simple to navigate and get around and work with your Congress and/or Cabinet Ministers to put forth your management plans.The backdrop is very obviously during the period of post WWII and the beginning of the Cold War, right from the years that started the biggest changes in history roughly about 1948. During this period, you will manage foreign affairs, local production and construction, research, finances and budget and military spending and deployment. Its no easy task and it will keep you busy. While this is going on, you will also be in a struggle both diplomatically and technologically to stay ahead of the USSR, who of course are spearheading the Communist movement throughout Central Asia. Keep in mind that you are not an absolute leader, but subject to the effects of the approval ratings of your own citizens, and the approval of foreign nations, so it is a game of leveraging your ability to create positive improvement domestically and abroad. The space race is also going on at this time with a roadmap to be the first nation on the moon. The most pressure comes from the fact that amidst all of this, the nuclear arms race has just started.The pacing is long so don`t expect a short game. You`ll likely play one game over numerous play sessions. The scope of it is sometimes overwhelming but very enjoyable. Not for those who want a short battle heavy RTS. This is definitely for those who enjoy delving into all aspect of macro management and whom like seeing the effects of their leadership on economic indicators as much and if not more than they do by the destruction they can cause on a battlefield though it does have tactical battle. You don`t have to play it like that kind of confrontation but in this one, a good strategic and armed forces helps as part of your strategic deterrent against the real enemy: war though even in this one you`ll find yourself plunged into many conflicts as the world powers and empires of the middle, renaissance and industrial ages change and indepence wars and revolutions are popping up everywhere.Recommended for the history or strategic buffs. If you`ve ever watched the ""Drunken History"" and felt like debating it, chances are this one is for you though you don't need to drink to enjoy it. Just make sure you stop and eat every once in a while.Recommended for detail oriented strategy buffs.			",73,6,0,21,17,1,8

I clicked on things until the entire US Army was swarming all over Korea and they were all promptly murdered by North Koreans. This game makes no sense, and made me cry.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Completely incomprehensible gameplay, without any proper tutorial makes this game pointless without spending alot of time trying to figure out how it works yourself or even with guides. Even when you uselessly grind through the steep learning curve you will be rewarded with a mediocre game at best, that other franchises have overshadowed and those atleast require alot less steep a learning curve. Overall not worth the bother to start with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game drops you in head-first with no explanation on how to actually play the game.  The only tutorials are a couple short YouTube videos that barely even explain how to play the game.  There is no way of knowing how to do something or what effect something you've done has.  Sometimes even if you make a decision your ""advisors"" can decide to do something different regardless of your decision.I would only advise getting this game if you are used to playing other Supreme Ruler games but otherwise, stick to other strategy games.  Especially as even the developer seems to have swept this one under the rug.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Only good thing about it is annex, colonize or liberate a nation option (only you cant liberate a nation when you have annexed it). Buy SR2020 instead, its much better and easier to play.

												It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t do not buy game is unbalanced and unrealistic. The game is riddled with bugs making the game incredibly bad to play. Every time I have suggested ways to make the game better I have been rudley ""told off"" by Battlegoat. The A.I. is full retard, it just clumps units everywhere and dosen't use them effectiveley in combat. I am a veteran at this game, and i can tell you it sucks. Stay away from this game, and stay away from battlegoat aka Sir WEREFUSEALLADVICEFROMOURPAYINGCUSTOMERS. And don't expect this game to get any better after all they relesed this half completed crap and after many patches its just as bad as it was on launch day. You have been warned!!!!!!Also stay away from 1936 and get Hearts of Iron its much much much better. Stay away from this and just get a Cold War mod for a paradox game. Oh yes and did i mention it dosent patch on steam, and then when we complain we are told to just ""do it ourselves"" and are sent to a download location that gives my computer a virus!

												Terrible game. First of all, the cold war context is purely from an ""American"" point of view. Basically capitalist countries are great and socialist countries are dictatorships. Just to give a few examples, Ukraine is considered a ""colony"" of the Soviet Union, Tibet is a ""colony"" of China... But Hawaii is not a colony of USA, it is just part of it... But French Polynesia is a colony of France. As far as I know both Hawaii and French Polynesia are territories originally from the Polynesian people... The only difference is that Hawaii is part of the USA and French Polynesia is part of France. So why considering only French Polynesia as a colony?Second, doens't matter how well you play with the USSR or how bad you play with the USA, the game is connected to historical events and all the countries will lean to the West anyways. You are not able to change the history (even if you invade USA and transform it in a communist country or a colony, you are still going to see -even socialist- countries leaning to the USA). Full of garbage.			",36,2,10,4,5,0,20

The game is kind of crappy and for some reason keeps sending a shutdown signal to my computer but for $2 I get a couple hours of fun turning Best Korea into glorious worker's paradise. I expected much better from something with the Paradox name on it but what can you do. I give it a ヽ(´ー｀)ノ/10 Also, the description made me think that this was some super autistic game with such depth and complexity that there were AI advisors that made decisions for you since you couldn't possibly manage everything on your own. In reality the AI advisors are needed because the UI is so awful that you can't possibly find and react to what you want to do in time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I played Supreme Ruler 2020 first then after I played this one. but After just some time I saw they had Supreme Ruler 1936 and started that one and them they developed Supreme Ruler : Ultimate, wich have all games in one. So what I recommend? Buy Supreme Ruler : Ultimate wich has everything and better gameplay if you like it a lot and want to help this company further buy this one and the others just to give them money. Awesome series.
