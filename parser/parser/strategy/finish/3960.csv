												Here is a guide for getting Shattered Union to work on WIndows Vista/7/8 etc.http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=230301http://forums.majorgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=230085Sorry about that... for some reason I was convinced there was a link to more details in that post. My mistake. Here's how you do it:1. In your Start Menu search field, type in ""msconfig"", without the "" "" of course.2. Click on the Boot tab.3. Click on the Advance Options button.4. Check the little box next to ""Maximum memory"" and set the max to 2048.5. Reboot computer.Now when it reboots, Windows will act and run as if there is only 2GB of memory installed. This will allow Shattered Union to run. After you're done playing, go back to msconfig and uncheck the Maximum Memory box and then reboot, to allow Windows full use of all your RAM.Again, sorry for the lack of detail earlier. I really do need to stop posting after I get home from work, but before I've had dinner...			",529,138,15,47,50,4,96

												As was said the game will not run on modern systems that use Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8. I'm using Windows 7  and get nothing but a black screen and then the game crashes.Read the small print of the system requirements which they have conveniently changed since I bought the game, it used to read XP, Vista and Windows 7.I also think older XP systems that have more then 2GB of memory/RAM may have problems running the game as well. If so there is a workaround where you go into MSconfig and set your system to only use 2GB of memory. Search google for the exact method. Be sure to turn it back though after playing the game as your computer performance will suffer with only using the 2GB of memory.Luckily I bought this game on sale for like $2 so not much lost but be forwarned everyone else.

												Do you like hexagonal wargames? This one isn't really breaking any molds or moving the genre forward, but it's rock solid. Shattered Union has a very niche market and never really sold well for the original Xbox, but interest in the Steam sale may have prompted a brief revival. In all fairness, that's probably a good thing.Shattered Union is an entry-level strategy game that just about anyone can pick up. It's probably not a game most people would put a lot of time into, but it's at the very least worth owning.			",950,289,28,103,75,9,153

												A basic and simple game that appeals to the tactful minded. The main strategy is to keep your units protected from airstrikes while keeping them out of range of groundforces until you decide to attack. With multiple ways to win a mission this game has decent replay value and may appeal to the die hard tactician as well as the casual gamer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To those saying it won't work - there is a simple workaround, easy to find with a quick search.Now, this isn't a great game. It's an ok game. But, for 5 bucks, Shattered Union is well worth it. Fight a modern day civil war across a fully destructable US as one of 7 factions, like the Midwest, California, and even the EU. The AI each has different personalities per game, which affects how it will fight.  Each map focuses on a small region of the US, with accurate towns/geography.  Your actions on the battlefield affect your reputation - preserve landmarks and buildings and you gain precision abilties; destroy everything in your path to victory and gain powerful destructive weapons.All in all, it's a fun, old, tactical turn-based military game.

												Game crashes when loading certain maps. The game was made for the Original Xbox, it seems nothing has changes since then. It does not work on computer running Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8. Look at the forums and reviews and you will see what I mean. If you do get it running, you can expect a simple but fun turn based strategy game. Fighting other states and their armies. Reuniting the nation by force, state by state. Taking cities, destroying land marks, bridges, and factores to gain the upperhand. Dispite being a competent and fun strategy game, I have to say pass on this game since it seems most users can't get it working or working properly.			",113,8,1,20,10,0,19

It simply doesn't work.I used to play this game a few years back, which was an enjoyable - though unoriginal - TBS.

												For people who like the older turn based hexoganal strategy games, (Panzer General comes to mind) this game is for you. The graphics arent all that but who cares! Its got all the military units of the U.S. along with its sound effects. Although futuristic, its still an enjoyable strategy. Its a slow paced games where you have to really think out tactically your moves. Since money is sparse you really have to be careful on losing your expensive units. Yes I cheated a bit and simply re-loaded the game when I would lose an expensive unit. But all in all, this game is awesome for your average day armchair general.			",67,16,0,52,8,0,48

Guess I didn't read the description very closely in my haste to spend 49 cents during a Steam sale. Thumbs up for a creative storyline, but I don't have the patience to play this.Also - be forewarned that it takes some system tweaking to make this run in Vista or 7. You can find that information in the Steam Forums. It's not difficult.			",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												I saw great potential with story and idea.  As one of the few turn based games I was hopeful.  It falls short, however.  The handoff between the strategic level and the tactical level has too many holes.  Also and I hate this common dodge but it does seem handicapped to the AI.  Perhaps with more digging in and such I could find the game worthwhile but it couldn't keep my interest enough for the effort.			",2,0,0,5,1,0,18

												Many games have tried to be like Shattered Union and all have fallen short of the mark.  While this could be far more than it is, no one has managed to do any better.Control US and Warsaw Pact units in a campaign to restore manifest destiny and re-unite the United States.  While the units themselves are more Panzer General than Steel Panthers, it is still very well done.Only major flaw is the need to reset your computer to run on only 2 Megs of memory using MS config before the game will work properly.

												When getting this, I expected some sort of engaging top-down strategy gameplay with a somewhat fleshed out world. Instead I got a clunky menu, unbalanced maps, gameplay that is beyond stiff, an annoying camera, and the same old generic  CoD story about Russia being behind all this and regressing back to the Soviet days. The factions all feel the same and there really isn't much substance as far as engaging gameplay, just build more and bigger tanks than everyone else and try your hardest to steamroll people. Terrain really isn't a factor in most battles and a smaller, more agile army can almost never outwit a larger, high-firepower one, brute force is ALL that matters, very little real tactics. Kinda regretting my purchase.			",93,9,0,10,21,0,19

												Terrible game, it's so slow paced and it's difficult to select let alone control your units. Not even worth free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game doesnt work on modern computers.  All I get is a black screen, not that it matters since it sucks.  The dev stated this game is no longer supported so no patches will be possible.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			",2655,1121,101,267,367,29,398
