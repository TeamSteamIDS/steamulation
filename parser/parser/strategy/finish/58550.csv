												It has been a long time since I had last played a game like this. The type of game you'd label ""A Shameless Cash in.""With the fourth season of Game of Thrones hitting the air, you might feel inspired to do your own bit of dynastic warfare. I am here to stop you. Whatever you do; you don't want to spend a penny on this pile of refuse. Game of Thrones Genesis is a broken and convoluted mess. It has some nice ideas, but pretty much everything stop it from working as it should.Game of Thrones Genesis is a Real Time Strategy game, but it has a twist. Instead of building units and testing your tactics against your opponents you are now in the business of building alliances and brokering treaties between the many colourful houses of Westeros. The goal is out out-prestiege your opponent. You achieve this by earning money, maintaining alliances with towns and castles, eliminating prominent enemy units, uncovering your enemies' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sons, and upholding the faith. To accomplish this you employ the services of assassins, envoys, rouges, spies and even your own daughters to break or make allegiences. If you think that this sounds pretty cool then you are sadly mistaken. The system is a micromanagement nightmare. It is impossible to see what you need to do, because each unit is highly specialised. Even your random highwayman can't just be told to kill the enemy envoy. You need another unit for that. To make matters worse, everything is tiny. Even my HD screen is too small to even give me a remote chance to properly click on the one unit I need. When all else fails you can always resort to war. War is an utter joke. Declaring war will deduct points from your prestige, so you need to trick your enemy into declaring war on you. What AI that cannot even walk from end of the map to the other without burrowing through a mountain is going to take your bait? War cannot be waged with your regular security units. Oh no, you need armies; special units that need food to function. Food is a resource that is advertised in the game as much as Sarin gas is advertised as a nice party trick on children's tv programming. You need to put peasants to work the field. However, both the peasants and the fields are hidden in the horrible interface and the unsightly map textures respectively. The army units then are supposed to work with a rock-paper-scissors system, but it doesn't. You're lucky if your army even goes to where you ask it to go. Just when you thought you had seen it all the crapshoot AI comes in. The campaign is joke. It tells the origin story of Westeros and the Iron Throne. You begin as the Martells and shortly after you play as the Targaryans to subjugate the entire continent. Only to lose it the inevitable alliance of Stark, Lannister and Baratheon in the endgame, followed by a little bit of 'What if' up at the wall. The problem is the crapshoot AI. The moment you start the stage the AI makes it move and beats you. The only way to win is by trial and error. Find out what the AI does, counter it in the first minute, and move from there. The AI will just keep on trying to do what it was going to do, but will fail forever. It is both lame and boring. What's the point of playing a Game of Thrones if there isn't even a real game to play. Don't buy this game. Avoid it like the plague. Put it in chains, drag it up to the wall, send it north, dump a couldron of gold on it, bury it in soft peat and finally recycle it as firelighters to burn the box it came in.

												This game was not what I was expecting at all. It was more like a fast paced board game than the sort of resource management and strategy game I thought it would be. I can't fault it for not being like the Total War games, which I was thinking it was, but I can fault it for not being particularly fun. As far as I can see from playing the tutorial and the first level, you basically run around with envoys and spies trying to keep alliances with towns while your opponents ruin your alliances and make their own. It can get a little hectic keeping up with all of that going on, while also trying to get some food or money together to make an army. You don't build structures in this game, they already exist on the map. What you do is build units, which will carry out certain tasks like assassinations and spying. The goal is to build alliances with nearby towns and castles to keep yourself stronger and richer than your enemies. You do this to collect prestige points, which determine the winner of the map. The combat in this game is not at all exciting, since your armies will consist of around 8 little guys that will hack at the other side's armies until one team is dead. You don't really want to declare war too often anyway, since it will cost you prestige points. So you want to convince the other guy to declare war, and then spend some time chasing around his units to destroy them, all while chasing his envoys with yours so that you can keep them from stealing your alliances.The graphics are decent but not particularly impressive. The music is standard fantasy fare. Not memorable, but not bad either.It's just not as impressives as I was hoping for, and I think I only gave it the time I did because of the GoT license. It does go back a ways to give you a taste of some of the origins of the great houses of Westeros, but I felt like the license was not important to the gameplay. It was like playing a licensed version of Monopoly, wherein the lore of GoT only ran skin deep. Overall I could not recommend this title.Grade: D			",777,367,21,112,93,8,122

												A Game of Thrones - Genesis is a ""boardgame"" style strategy game with real-time-strategy elements. It's a simple concept: you begin with a ""home base"" and slowly expand your empire. But that is where simplicity ends: expanding your empire is accomplished principally by winning the loyalty of neighboring towns and castles with diplomatic envoys. The more towns that are loyal to you, the more income you have, and income will help you produce more units. Then, you will need to create some spy rings in enemy cities, subdue spies in your own cities, assassinate nobles, and other nefarious acts in order to succeed. You can even have the enemy create and command units that he thinks are working for him, but are actually working for you. It is the most layered, deep espionage system I have ever seen in a game (think Civ4 times 15). That being said, I also feel that the game is too deep for an RTS, playing strategically requires a bit of deep thought and I felt intimidated about having to think faster than my opponent, rather than being able to take my time and press ""end turn"" like in Civilization or Master of Orion.Here is most of the game's complexity in a nutshell: envoys create alliances, spies ruin alliances, nobles create blood alliances, assassins ruin blood alliances, guards block towns from assassins, spies and assassins working together can circumvent guards. Spies can reveal hidden enemy units, because about 90% of the units in the game are visible only to the player who controls them. They are on a generous ""stealth timer"" when in enemy territory.The Good* Great interface, smooth controls.* A game so deep that it could never be released on anything but PC.* The game is very well suited for multiplayer matches with a friend.* It is kind of fun to learn, but I assume you cannot truly appreciate it until you have mastered the basics (which I was never able to do.)* Lots of achievements to unlock.* High skill ceiling.The Bad* Long load times* Expensive pricetag, the game would be a fair buy at $10, but not $20.* Very little connection to the A Game of Thrones series that we know and love, except for the Lannisters are all jerks and killed me in my first match.* The game might be too complex for many people. I don't want you to confuse ""complex"" with ""strategic."" There are times when things are needlessly complex.* Some small problems with the tutorial. It will direct you to ""look at the map in the lower right corner,"" when the map is actually in the lower left. Also, the ""back"" button does absolutely nothing in the tutorial's dialogue boxes.* High-learning curve.* The game is not friendly to colorblind players. The fog of war is just a b&w version of the map, but it's very difficult to differentiate between the colored (visible) parts of the map and the b&w (fog of war) parts of the map, especially in snowy areas. If you are colorblind, you will go mad if you try to play as the Starks.* The battle animations are, well, terrible - but I'd rather have bad animations than bugs. Additionally, although war is a large aspect of the game, 90% of the game is the espionage that happens before the war.The Ugly* Uses TAGES DRM. (5 machine installation limit).The VerdictIf you are looking for an ultra-deep strategy game, pick this up. If you are new to 4X games, I would suggest waiting for it to go on sale for >49%, as the game is really hard to appreciate if you aren't already intimately familiar with its genre.I'd be happy to answer any other questions that you may have, just message me.

												This game is rough. It has some interesting ideas about how to do video game diplomacy and intrigue, but those ideas are undeveloped, and make the interaction between the houses of Westeros feel like the mere shuffling around of RTS game pieces. It does have an admirable commitment to the series lore, but to get to the lore, you have to play through a dreary campaign which includes frustrating escort missions. You can control a Targaryen dragon, and it feels pretty powerful, but the actual mechanics of doing so are excessively ""gamey"" (your dragon has a recharge time, making it less a creature of legend and more of an occasional special ability).The presentation of the game is subpar, with a lot of tiny details that are just ""off"" enough to pull me out of the experience. And the RTS mechanics are a bit undercooked - there's not a lot of unit diversity (or distinctiveness to the units that exist) and the tech tree, such as it is, is mediocre. The most interesting part of the game is the specialized intrigue and diplomatic units, and even then, I find the challenge of not knowing which alliances are real or which units are loyal to be more of a test of mental endurance than a genuine political-style puzzle.The game is not entirely without merit, but I would not recommend buying it without first seriously lowering your expectations.

												This game is just the name and nothing else. Basically is just a strategy game with no strategy at all, just a bunch of units of deception, politics and intrigue that doesn't feel coherent or well integrated into the game but awkward and forced.The game forces you to constantly check the status of your alliances, your secret agreements, the enemy's secret agreements with your allies, the protection of your units (you even have to assign bodyguards to farmers because they're a yummy target for assassins), the vulnerable strategic units of your enemies like envoys, spies, brides, rebels and other assassins to send even more assassins after them. And all of that with one single purpose: making and keeping as many alliances as possible while trying to destroy as many as possible alliances of your enemies while producing enough food and gold to bring armies to the table.And for a military based game battles are very simple: just send as many soldiers as you can, no others plan needed.The mechanics of the game are just too complicated to be a game that worths paying for it.

												7/10A great game if you read the books. NOT for the casual fan.I'm sorry if that sounds a little snobbish, but this game is deep in the lore of Westeros, your campaign starts before the Iron throne was even an idea. The history which Arya and Danaerys are determined to honour is right here, and what a tangled web it is.This is a great game, but demanding, with spies and agents under every rock, castle and farm creating the atmosphere.You need a hell of an attention span, a dozen extra pairs of eyes, and a mind as twisted as the imp or Littlefinger to even attempt this one. An RTS where you don't know which assets you truly control until it's too late. You will be stabbed in the back repeatedly by lords who swore allegiance to you, but so will your enemies! If you think you have what it takes to bribe, murder and betray your way to the top, bring it on.I warn you though:When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die!			",514,169,14,124,78,7,213

												Being a massive fan of the book series and television show, I bought this game the day it was released. It has gone down in history as one of my most regretted gaming purchases. Cyanide's A Game of Thrones - Genesis is a messily designed, technically janky game that I wouldn't recommend to any besides the die-hard fan, who isn't reading this review anyway.The game is essentially a virtual board game, in which you send one of a few kinds of units around a map in order to maintain control of them. It's largely tedious and frustrating. You can do this in a story campaign, which gives you small maps and half-thematic objectives. I didn't make it far into this story and wouldn't recommend you do so. Much more tolerable if not actually enjoyable is the multiplayer mode, in which you select a larger portion of Westeros to fight over with computer or human opponents. Though I very much doubt you will find human opponents online at this point. The gameplay in the multiplayer mode is slightly more interesting, with a few more kinds of units and actions you can take. To be frank, Genesis seems like a game designed with bullet points in mind. Marketing materials might say you can marry off your noble daughter to an enemy to cement an uneasy alliance, or send an agent to infiltrate the enemy AS an enemy agent, and then turn him when the enemy thinks he's hurting you with that double agent. Both of these are true, but these mechanics are very shallow and there are only a few of them.In the end Genesis will likely leave you wanting, as a fan of Martin's world. I might recommend instead the actual board game from Fantasy Flight Games, or the Crusader Kings 2 conversion mod. Sadly, an amateur game modification is vastly superior and better supported than this official game.			",219,79,7,32,42,3,33

												I give it a 4 out of 10, because while it does make some reference to the novels, the gameplay and graphics are horrible... The graphics remind me of Age of Empires II which came out almost 10 years ago.The whole game is an attempt to rip off the growing fan-base of the series... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!No matter how good the sale is, it is a waste of money and time. If you like games with simple graphics that are absolutely not fun or enjoyable,then by all means, waste your life playing A Game of Thrones: Genesis.			",222,41,5,20,22,2,36

												There are a lot of negative reviews about this game, for example the lack of combat or real RTS feeling/element.However, although certain parts of that may be true, the game is very unique.The lack of combat allows for a far more political and stealthy way of capturing villages - either by sending a spy to secretly take resources, an ambassador to ensure the loyalty of the village, then cemented with a marriage of a royal lady. This can then be undone by removing the bride with an assassin.The game does feel a bit slow at time and does not feel like a classic RTS, so if you are in to games such as Warhammer etc. I would say miss this one out.But if you are open minded and the game is going for a reasonable price (I'd say below 15/ 10 dollars) I would recommend it, there is also a campaign that can be fairly challenging at times and a walk in the park at others but does provide a lot of gameplay (somewhere between 10-20 hours i would estimate, but that's just a guess).

												I'd feel sorry for writing this if I thought anyone put serious effort into this game, but I have no evidence of that.I'll put it plain: Don't buy this crap. This is not worth your money. It barely counts as Game of Thrones, and I don't know why they put the word Genesis on there (I don't think it means what they think it means.) It's a generic, limited, poorly articulated strategy game that tries to pass pointless tedium as politics and intrigue. Its campaign has nothing to show for itself and I'd apologize to whoever I roped into playing it multiplayer.If you truly want to have a Game of Thrones gaming experience, check out the Game of Thrones mod for Crusader Kings II. I think the current version requires some DLC to function properly but I assure you, it's worth it. For a free modification of an already-good game, it has a thousand times more complexity and good design put into it than Genesis.If at any point you see another review of mine that says ""I can think of worse games"", I'm thinking of this.Do. Not. Buy.			",67,18,0,32,13,1,47

												This game is creative and full of good ideas. It introduces a nice system of spies assassins diplomates and secret alliences. There are suductions and sabatages and bribes and double agents.Unfortunatly the game is horribly executed.The game pace is to quick for its own good. It gives no time to observe the actions of potential traitors or plan alliences the best strategy is just to spend the extra money and go for everyone.But the final blow is the military side of the game.War gets declared and all the best mechanies of the go away and it becomes a build, build build charge game with a lack of strategy. Additionally raiders and assassins are so cheap that they are the only units worth getting. Why bother spying or bribing when you can assassinate everyone with half the effort.This game had so much potential which is why it is so disappointing.			",18,5,0,5,13,1,25

The units and characters are generic tropes and could be set in any universe, the link to GoT is tenuous at best. A  rather disappointing use of the License.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun little juant through the broad strokes of pre-book era Westerosi history. A fun little game, but certainly not a deep and strategic RTS, more of a set-piece manager- moving specially skilled units around to build and maintain alliances is the heart of it, with actual declared war working in a very similar mechanic. Still, depsite the simplistic and somewhat sophmoric gameplay, the game shines with great lore and setting, and should reward loyal fans of the Books and Show. Make sure you get this on sale, it is certainly not worth a full retail price, offering low replay and a 12 hour or so campaign. Someone looking for a more deep and strategic RTS experince in the GoT world would want to check out the great mods for Civ5 and CKII. The former is a world class standard and far better for war and battle while the latter offers an immersive strategic experience in the delicacies of politics, marriage, and subterfuge. Game of Thrones: Genesis attempts both but really only succeeds in atmosphere. Remember that Halo RTS? Like that, except Game of Thrones and  far less exciting. In summary: - good graphics and polish- rewards fans of the lore- simplistic & arcadey RTS gameplay- no real depth to game beyond faction ""unique"" units- campaign is fun and short- low replayability- not a serious RTS- still a fun little game for fans, if bought for a low sale price			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is similar to the structure of Command & Conquer where you have a home base and a mission objective, but you must capture and hold towns for money and farm fields for food to raise army to fight enemy units and capture enemy castles. Its not as boring as it sounds, there is strategy to this use of spies to gather intel and uncover secret agreements, envoys to ally yourself with towns and rogues to make towns rebel against the enemy. This is not like Total war the ideas of morale and combat strategy play no part in this games, you use pikeman to counter horseman, archers to counter men-at-arms. Like Command & Conquer you have set missions, where resources and men arent passed onto the next mission which can be frustrating. The missions state with scarce resources and few troops and each mission is usually a challenge until you reach a tipping point where you have the resources to produce a surplus of troops and other units and victory is almost assured. Id recommend this game to anyone who'd like to see how the history of Game of Thrones, Westeros came to be and the conflicts between houses prior to the series, it offers a lot of detail but unlike most games where you are constantly fed information of the enviorment and current events you struggle to keep up with it. GoT Genesis offers the detail in game and in the form of an encyclopedia which offers indept information into game mechanic, unit information, House information etc, This game of good for those who are fans of the GoT books and series, and for those who enjoy Command & Conquer and those who like strategy games. 90/100Only thing is the missions dont only the mission focus around the Targeryn history and the are not a lot of missions, but AI custom missions seem good.

At the time of writing this review, I've yet to read the books or watch the t.v. series. But this hasn't affected what I'm about to write about this game.It's defiantly an interesting take on the RTS genre, trying to implement the world of Game of Thrones as well. So I will give it that.To start with, I did the tutorial missions to help to get the grips of how the game flows and performs. But when I actually started to play the campaign, it still felt like it was in tutorial mode. Telling me what to do next, and not letting me do anything else. This was the case for the majority of the first chapter, when you're playing as the initial kingdom in the desert. And that's about a good 3 or 4 hours into playing, if you're slow player like my self ;D.I did continue playing into the second chapter, and it did feel like it was picking up with giving you the freedom to actually play. Rather than heavily suggesting what your next move should be.I imagine that this game would be more fun and intriguing to play in a multilayer session with friends, or even against random people.The game is heavily focused around it being a political and backstabbing game, rather than a game based on declaring war on the other kingdoms. So in that respect, it does utilise that well with all the non-combat units it offers and the different buildings on each section of the map. If you don't actually want to go down the political route and such, you can quite effectively go down the war path to win the game. You just need to make sure you have enough influence across the kingdom to fund your army.You'll just need to constantly watch over your spies, rogues, envoys and buildings etc. If not, you can easily be deceived by the A.I. and be quite gimped in your influence and resource gain. You'll also loose units by assassination attempts.The concept is good, it just felt like it was not properly executed with this style of game. It would of performed better if it was like a turn based 4X game, similar to the Civilization series.I will probably come back to this game one day and give it another bash, once I've read the books or seen the t.v. series. Come into it with a new perspective. But it's defiantly a game which isn't for every one, so be warned when purchasing.But if you're committed to playing a game which focuses on tactics other than declaring war and fighting it out, then go for it! It isn't all that bad.In conclusion:  A unique and interesting concept, but not executed well enough to work effectively.  Very hand holding heavy to start with, takes a few hours before it feels like you can play freely.  Very overwhelming with the need to micro manage each individual unit and building. Too much can go on at once.  Would of been better off as a turn based 4X game.  Takes a while to fully grasp on how to effectively play, without the A.I. wiping you out.  Games can take a good while to finish, which is good if you like your RTS games to last.  Pick it up in a sale if you want to try it out, it will keep you entertained for a little while at least.5 / 10, tried to ride the Game of Thrones hype train and got stuck in the homeless cart as a result.

												Don't get this confused with the Game of Thrones RPG.  This has a lot of nice features and it is a very polished game but it is really... short. It would be very hard to make a single session last more than a hour. It is very nice but its not really worth the price. While it might be different in multiplayer it is very shallow though well finished.			",30,4,0,16,11,0,12

												I don't think it's coincedence that the game play is never explained in any of the promo material.  The screenshots make it seem like this is an AGOT RTS with military units but that is completely misleading.  Yes, there are military units but they function so poorly you start to wonder if the programmer had a stroke mid way through programming the units.  Most of the game play is with specialized non-combat units that can only serve one function.  The only sliver of this game I enjoyed (as a book reader) had literally nothing to do with the game.  It was the lore and visualization of events that took place before ASOFAI takes place.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.  THIS GAME SHOULD BE BANNED FROM STEAM.			",79,13,3,18,22,3,28

												Honestly all the hate aimed at this game is kind of unwarranted. If you're a fan of the SOIAF series and universe, its worth a try - I wouldn't want to pay more than 15$ for it to be fair; but its not /awful/. Slow, kind of tedious and lacking the more massive army/Age of Empires level of military combat and absolutely no town/castle building - it still proves to be enjoyable for something slow-paced and involved. You're always having to keep on the lookout for people trying to cut down your alliances and expanding your own alliances is a must to win truthfully - the combat is a bit clunky and simplified and it really is a pain having to worry about holding alliances with every town instead of just marching a massive army on them - but the game isn't /terrible/.

												A slightly undercooked RTS experience in a Game of Thrones flavour. Despite the many glaring flaws with the game, including no actual base building and a sparse smattering of battles, I actually had a good amount of fun. Especially considering I picked it up for a couple of bucks. The campaign is dreary and kind of monotonous. The most fun I had was in the House vs House games on the Westeros map where you control one of the major houses from the books / tv show. The game has some interesting takes on brokering alliances and I found it refreshing that I wasn't having to micromanage units all the time.TL;DR - I had fun with the game but maybe you won't. I will concede that the game has very little for anyone who isn't a big fan of the source material. Pick it up on sale for some good cheap fun.			",72,8,1,13,3,2,9

												It's horrible to see this game next rated so low that it almost reaches the kind of treatment Ride to Hell or No Man's Sky receaved.WHILE IT IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY ADVANCED GAME.Not only that. But it is filled with conent and had so much work behind making it.So let's start with the basics.This is not an RTS.At least it shouldn'T really be considered one.Because while it happens in real time the game it self focuses more around managing your alliances than actual fighting or tactics.The recipie for basics is the following:So send a diplomat to a town/village/castle and he makes an alliance over time.You send your spy to hostile towns to make secret agreemnts which your enemy won'T know about. You can defend your own towns with Diplomats from hostile diplomats.And your spies can reveal enemy spies and your mercs will take shot work of them.Now this is the basic of the politics system. There is much more dpet to it but I'm not going to further explain. The game works like a super advanced combination of Malefic and Risk.Where you have to defend your settlements against enemy ainfluence while simultaniously conquering new ones.The battles are extremely boring on the other hand and there is not much to talk about them.So let's talk about everything else in the game:Graphics : Pretty avareage for its time not nice but not horrible either. It didn't make me womith so in my opinion it is alright. I think if the game would have a similar design as Eu4 or CK2 it would look nicer because the artwork in this game is actually really good.Music and Sounds: For the music part again pretty mediocre. For voice acting I think it is good. You could argue though. I haven't heard all voices in the game so far but the normal units sound alright. Other sounds in the game are not annoying either.Story: since it is based on the historical backstory of the The Song of Ice and Fire there is nothing innovative or stunning about it. It basicly tells the story how it is.SO should you buy it?Is it on sale?Are you in love with the game of thrones games and have read ALL books including documentraies and spinoffs?Do you like slow pased games?Do you want something different in terms of strategy?If 3 of the 4 answers are yes then YES you should.Otherwise pass. You won't like it since there is nothing particulary interesting about the game. I think that's why it's failed.			",60,5,0,10,3,0,18

												I did end up pre-odering this game prior to release, it cost me a fair ammount more than it is avaliable for now and I have it on disk. Anyway, The best part about this game is that it delves into some key parts of the history of ASOIAF / GOT.The gameplay is different, but certainly not great. I think some of the other reviews are a little harsh, but the gameplay did dissapoint me when I first got the game. It is definitely playable but I think I have played all that I ever will do of it. The campaign is, in my opinion, worth the £7. It runs through certain key evens through the history Westeros which is ultimately why I am giving it the thumbs up.My recommendation to play this is more aimed at the book audience of the series. If you want learn about some of the historical events that develop Westeros to be like it is at the start of the series, this is the game for you, but dont expect it to be like a total war game.Plus the game is quite cheap (especially compared to what I had to pay for it -_-)			",231,24,6,26,16,2,20

												This game, in my personal opinion, is difficult to play, compare to other games which are similar in style to that of Age of Empires and Starcraft. It does have it's moments, and if anything, revolutionises the strategy genre, as it adds aspects which you would not consider. This game tries to bring realism into this seemingly boring genre by adding a new form of controlling a town with the spokesmen and through marriage, and a new threat, such as traitors among you're soldiers. I think the biggest let down though, is the fact that the system of controlling neighbouring villages to be to complicated, aswell as the combat system. Maps, I feel should have been larger, and a bit more dangerous, but other wise, it is a decent game...LARGELY better than the one based on the TV show, what a disaster.			",155,20,0,17,14,0,32

												I try my utmost hardest to never give a thumbs down, I really do.I have always been a fan of real-time strategy games. I also fell in love with A Song of Ice and Fire when I watched the first season, then immdiately consumed the 5 current books. When this game launched, I was so excited and thought it would be a fantastic game.Sadly, it was not.The micromanaging in this game is seriously absurd if you are used to playing ANY other strategy game.You do not engage in ""battles"" per se. From the screenshots it really looks like you can have units engage in battle like in the Total War series. That does not happen here. Instead, you have very specific units scurrying around the map. Send envoy here; send assassin there. The feedback and interface in-game is horrendous, it is very difficult to keep track of things.Honestly, avoid this game, even if you are THE MOST die-hard fan of GRRM's work.If you want a FANTASTIC, lore-friendly (and supplementary) game, look at: The RPG version That one has actual meat you can sink your fan-driven teeth into. This one, sadly, is a great disappointment and I sincerely hope no one else wastes their money on this.			",250,88,0,51,38,2,49

												Great idea for a game, bad game. It might be worth it IF you want to try to play through the history of the A Song of Ice and Fire. Apart from that, it is not worth it, even with that idea to want to play through the historical moments, the game mechanics make it unplayable. Clicking does not fully work for some reason. The mechanics and AI of the game are just horribly done. I wouldn't recommend anyone playing this unless you want to punish yourself to just want to get through for the story and achievements.

												This game is by no means a ""Starcraft 2"" type game, but it represents the books and tv show very well (assuming whoever is reading this is a fan thats smart enough to understand everything thats going on in the books/tv show and able to keep up)This game is true to the title it bares and is a must have for intelligent fans of the franchise.However, if you are a gamer that believe RTS games are only about collecting resources and building the best army to figh with, then you're probably the type of gamer that never plays Chess because you suck at it and you'll probly hate this game. But remember, just because you feel naked with out a massive army in a RTS game, that doesn't make it a bad game. It just makes you a bad strategist.... A Game of Thrones is based on the series of books called ""A Song of Ice & Fire"" written by George R.R. Martin. Thse books ARE NOT War Novels. So DON""T walk in to this game expecting epic battles!

												This game fails to capture any kind of Game Of Thrones spirit, and failed to use any decent RTS game mechanics. If they had scraped the idea of making this game an RTS, and had inspired it to be more Total War-esq, then this would probably have been a worth while game if you're a fan of GoT. As it is, it's a failed embarrassment that isn't worth the disk space its stored on.			",112,10,0,28,49,2,43

												The Campaign was♥♥♥♥♥♥br>I got to the point where no matter what I did the npc died and the quest failed, I tried different tactics, leave him behind, and fight them, turtle him and fight them, engage them and make him run ahead, didn't matter they just aimed for him and ignored me and he kept dying. It was so dumb.Single player or free play style was okay but theres only so much you can do, take over this kingdom, marry a noblewoman off, spy on them sabotage them, for something with the game of thrones branding on it, this game was very weak, at first it seemed like an AoE game with more subltey roguish aspects, nope, they didn't do amazing in any aspect.

												Play as all 7 kingdoms during the past of the actual series. Play as Aegon ""The Conqueror"" as he starts his conquest for the realm. Play as Robert Baratheon during ""The Rebellion"". This game is not like other RTS games. This one makes you think like a king. Make Alliances, get towns and castles to join your cause, wed and watch over your territories, build armies and declare war. Ofcourse, always watch for betrayal, a typical GoT thing. If you're looking for a RTS game that's different, give Game of Thrones a try. If you're a true fan to ""Song of Ice and Fire"" (HBO: Game of Thrones) This is a game for you. :) ",51,3,0,6,7,0,15

Selecting one unit becomes a click-frenzy, not acceptable in a game where every second counts and you can't select a squad.And don't get me started on the damnable camera blocking your line of sight.If you like RTS games, run from this as if it was a real dragon.

												This game would be perfect...if it was turn-based. All the possible strategies make it a true GoT experience, full of politics,  warfare and spies. But...well, it's real-time. The amount of things you have to take into account at any given time, combined with all the available strategies will make this game overwhelming even to Starcraft pros. Don't waste your money, unless you're a supercomputer who happens to be a fan of the series. In my opinion, a wasted opportunity.			",104,21,1,13,4,0,18

												Personal rating: 6/10Replayability: LowBudget: ASOIAF fans should get it. RTS fans who have other RTS fan friends who are also interested in getting this, should go ahead. Everyone else should consider it carefully before getting this game. Lenght: A week at least. This game is actually a very good RTS game. I enjoyed it a lot, but the campaign is seriously a drab. Through out the entire campaign, I felt like I was unnecessarily being forced to do things that didn't feel like they were intended to be part of the original gameplay. Further more, the campaign grooms the player to focus on things that aren't important when fully playing the game. ASOIAF fans can get some small lore lessons from this games, and as an RTS game, I think it was excellent, but no one plays it, and lacking a good campaign, I felt it was a failure. If you have friends to play with, this game could quickly get pretty awesome. I haven't seen an RTS game this decent since Battle for Middle earth, which it is also very comparable with. This game also offers quite a bit of diplomacy and trade (or at least attempts to include this) which is nice. Could have done more on that front though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Naprawdę dobra gra jeśli tylko jesteś otwarty na inny styl prowadzenia rogrywki niż  klasycznych RTS-ach. Poświęć jej więcej niż godzinę a nie będziesz żałować. Nie jest to dzieło sztuki, ale kiedy zrozumiesz założenia gry, to zaczynasz czerpać z niej radość. Gra polega na kontrolowaniu mapy, w czym nieustannie musisz konkurować z przciwnikiem. Działania są jawne (jak dyplomacja, wojsko) oraz niejawne (to czego przeciwnik nie widzi: tajne umowy, szpiedzy, skrytobójcy, zdrajcy, przekupstwo). Warstwa militarna jest bardziej uproszczona niż w klasycznych RTS-ach aby zmusić gracza do podjęcia gry bardziej wyrafinowanej, co fajnie wpasowuje się w klimat sagi. Na wyższych poziomach trudności gra jest naprawdę wymagająca i potrzeba sporej podzielności uwagi. IMO warto dać jej szansę.I realy enjoyed this game, mostly becouse It was much different than any other RTS I'd ever played. It focus on operating behind enemy lines, in the shadows. You must take control over the map, and to do so, You have to use plenty of units as spy, hitman, nobles, guards and so on. It's more like conspiracy than military game, and becouse of that it gets harder and much more satysfiying. I felt like in real Westeros. I recomend this game to everyone that wants something new, is open to new style of playing RTS, and mostly Game of Throne fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game had good potential, but it was spoilt by bad interface, controls, camara and gameplay. This stories themselves are interesting but in conjunction with this bad qualities it doesn't redeem the game. It is an alright game if you only pay £2.99 but anymore isnt worth the time.30/100.

												I was a little dubious that this could be another quick cash in on a popular franchise, and while gameplay can be tedious and repetative at times it's true to the lore and a primarily a fun game to play.If you're a casual gamer, I'd avoid it.

A complete rip-off of Game of Thrones.I don't believe they even have the license to label it Game of Thrones so they added an ""A"" before it, lastly with SEGA's ""Genesis"" afterwards? Pulling a South Park there.They don't even have the music/theme, or anything that cause them liability. But the text/wording clearly gives away of it stealing everything from the novel/TV-Show.The game is a Not-So-Massive Multiplayer gamestyle like Age of Empires. Couldn't really get into it it's really f*cking confusing.Not worth it!1/10 ",774,159,33,63,61,3,97

												If this game was somehow turn based, like the GoT Fantasy Flight game, then it would be pretty true to the political intrigue of the series.  I want to recommend it to anyone who is familiar with the cardgame, to try it.. As you may feel the same way. Whilst all the diplomacy pieces are there, the interface for doing things is quite painful. Just a wheel around the characters with the actions on a click would have been fine. Instead the game decides on using old RTS style menus and build screens. Stylistically, if it were layed out like a board game it may feel better too.For RTS fans, this will feel horrible. You don't want diplomacy, you want war.. However this game is about getting a foot hold over every square inch using spies, envoys, assassins, peasants and then underhanded versions of all that.. And of course marrying off your children... In order to hold up a thin impression of peace and compassion for the other players in the game.  There is a blue bar at the top of the screen, the peace bar,  when it goes completely red you are at war with the other factions, so hopefully your political moves pay off and you have sufficient food and gold to create armies to put down your foes. The game really resides more in the ""Ticket to Ride"" boardgame pile. If you have bought this and have yet to play it... Think of it as a real time board game, with a really bad interface, and you might get something out of it.For me.. I'm going to weep a little and bury it, because it touches on everything to make a satisfying experience, but fails to pull it all together.			",595,222,45,89,83,1,128

												The game controls are really iffy. It is hard to make out on the map which are your units and which are the enemy. And even worse when you have to try to click on them to actually make them do anything. This was not a problem so much when there was just on unit in the area, but if eg. at your town you have more than one unit, it is extremely hard to manage to click on the one you want.  The idea of the game was ok, but the controls take all the joy of playing it.			",29,8,0,9,3,0,12

												I am die-hard fan of books, but i couldn't stomach this game. While the concept is good, the world feels the same as in books, and there're many great ideas for an RTS game, the execution is sadly awful. I really wanted to like this game, but ... no way. Outdated graphics, no AI to speak of, bad controls/interface, poor combat, no tactics.It's much better to buy Crusader Kings 2 and play Game of Thrones mod.Overall it would be nice game around 1999, but I'd still rather play Dune2000 over this turd.

I went back and forth with Steam and the developers for days on end trying to get them game working. None of the solutions they provided worked and both spent more time blaming the other than actually providing help.Months later when I finally did get it working I find it has some rather debilitating bugs that are pretty explocatable. Some of which include being completely unable to finish the tutorial due to  enemy spies getting stuck in areas you absolutely have to have your spies in order to finish the narrow minded quests. (Two enemy spies can't be near each other or the more recent one will run away and ignore all orders until it gets home) This sort of bug ends up making the game unplayable because there is no natural way to skip the tutorial and get to the real campaigns.The skirmish mode proves to be even worse since in order to win the game you have to please people. Which means this is a war game based on being gentle with people's feelings rather than, you know, warring.  Which means you can be waging war and going so with extreme skill and having a very one sided winning streak in all the battles. Yet still lose because you hurt to many feelings.I understand a large portion of what made up the show was the politics and underhanded negotiations. But it was handled in the poorest way possible. The only way this game could have been made worse is if they took away the ability to pick what house you play as in the craptastic skirmish mode. Then again  I did not see any difference between the houses so in the end it's only a colored flag with no meaningful value.			",81,9,1,19,14,1,27

												an interesting game, a bit slow pase and feels a lot like a wierd clone of age of empires II. Dont allow straying ""from the path"" that much, and that adds some to the slow pace feel. Not really a game for the fans of the tv or book series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   I bought this game when it was on sale for 1 dollar.... what a ripoff. Now i should say ive read through the book series several times and love the show i was such a huge fan i bought this game knowing it was bad, but i had no idea it would be this bad.    In the campaign you start off as Nymeria a character who is literally only mentioned once in the entire ""A song of ice and fire"" series (Arya 1, a game of thrones). Now ive read the books at least 4 times each and the tales of dunk and egg series, and even i don't think this is a good idea, Literally NOBODY i know that has read the series had any idea who she was.    Now it would be ok if it let you pick a stage and a difficulty, for instance if it let you start a campaign doing Robert's rebellion or the war of five kings but it doesnt, it makes you start by doing diplomacy with nymeria in Dorne.  Sorry I am a HARDCORE asoiaf fan and even i couldnt get through the first campaign without being mind numbingly bored.   You have been warned....worst case of ""OMG i got a license lets pump out some crap so we can exploit its popularity as soon as possible."" F*** this game.			",12,9,0,11,4,0,5

												Totally annoying... I bought this game to have some fun playing the time before the HBO-series.Now, I can watch the opening cinematic and then... black screen. I have to admit, the background music of the black screen is pretty nice, but it´s not really worth the money I payed for this game.For everyone interested in this game, I can only advise you to stay away. I hit everyone of the requirements and still can´t play it. Better spend the time and money for some books, BluRays or other games.Really bad decition to buy it :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
