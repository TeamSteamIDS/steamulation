												I like this game, but I don't recommend it for an 'average' player.  Pros:1. Maps. The maps are very beautiful, atmospheric, and very large.  There is lots of Bloom.  The zoom range is very dramatic, and there is lots of space for maneuver.  So much that you will usually have to make use of 2x and 4x time during the maneuver phase of the battles.2. RPG aspects and DLC.  There are magical items and other skills for you to upgrade your units, and the DLC has legendary and supernatural units.  I don't mind this, it adds a bit of spice to the game, but some of the historical wargame enthusiast reviewers don't like this aspect as much.Cons:1. Campaign is not great.  You basically just unlock a series of maps, eventually seizing Bagdad as Richard Lionheart, and then reverse the process as Saladin.  There are some decisions to make along the way, but they still don't add up to what I would call a 'dynamic' campaign.2. DLC units do not appear in multiplayer.  If not for the multiplayer, the game would be a throwaway once you complete the campaigns.  Unfortunately the DLC units are annoyingly absent from the custom and multiplayer battle roster - a pity.3. BUGS.  There is a runtime error that has been widely reported, and supposedly this will not be fixed for Win7 64-bit systems.  I played through the whole crusader campaign only to not be able to complete the last battle.  Very disappointing indeed.4. Can't save battles.  The battles, being on very large maps, also take a long time (over 30 minutes of real time).  They can't be saved mid-battle.  That is all.I cannot recommend this to a casual player, but if you really like historical RTS and want a different perspective and style than the Total War series, then you might find this title interesting.

												Got this at 70% off. I just finished the crusader campaign in this game (8 hours or so.) I didn't really expect to like this game as much as I have. It's kind of a RTS with no real base mechanics. Sort of like X-Com would be if the battles were fought RTS style with squads rather than tactical RPG. Anyways, this company also makes King Arthur which I've played a little bit of. King Arthur seems a bit slower to start, but looks to have more variety. Oh, actually, this game is very similar to Dawn of War 2, another great game. Wait for it to go on sale and get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My first review gave this game a positive, but since then all it does is crash with a runtime error. Uninstalling then reinstalling has made no difference.It seems the devs can't be bothered to fix it for 64 bit systems either, using the excuse that they can't duplicate the error. But apparently, it crashes for many people with a 64 bit PC, so I find that excuse very hard to believe. It's probably more like they won't spend any more time and money going through all the code on this old title just to make it work on some modern machines.My recommendation would be to download the demo first (on their own site, Gamershell, or Fileplanet, etc.) to see if it even works on you computer. IF it does, then it's actually not a bad game if you like the real time battles from Total War, with some RPG elements of its own.			",16,8,0,15,18,0,5

Choose a battle, select an outcome, recruit troops and level them up with experience. Based on what appears to be the Total War engine King's Crusade aquits itself well for a linear but faithful re-creation of the times.			",255,51,4,82,52,8,104

												This is an excellent game. You feel the power of the movement of the trooops as they charge. This engine is really sweet. Money is no problem and your units build skill with every battle. This is a must have for all that love History and I enjoy both camps. Just hold on to your hats and enjoy.  O, build huge amounts of cheap troops going into the first battle. They can upgrade as you have a rest area for units.			",4,0,0,2,2,0,16

												If you enjoyed King Arthur (also a Paradox Game) then you will want to own and play King's Crusade.  It's essentially the same game mechanics with a few new improvements.  The same depth of detail is present as with King Arthur, the graphics are beautiful, the sound and music is top-notch and the history virtually drips off the screen.  The King's Crusade is a must buy for fans of King Arthur, and I highly recommend it to all strategy fans.			",234,56,2,116,42,4,119

												The Kings' Crusade is a crime against gaming. I really wanted to like this game; it's set in an interesting time period, features cool historical figures and looks good on paper. However, all that you will take away from this game is that it is more broken than my dreams, is savagely unbalanced and is about as fun as amateur surgery.The main meat of this game is Total War-style RTS battles. However, where the Total War franchise manages to create suspense, challenge and fun, Kings' Crusade creates frustration, sadness and glitches. The battles themselves are plagued by poor troop-control mechanics (which is to say, they are as unbelievely slow-moving, have barely any formations and run away to attack the enemy at random). This combines with the insanely over-powered enemy to create a massively annoying experience. Take the second mission for example: the Saracens for some reason receive 2 missile launcher squads (I'm not even kidding). These boys will rip through your janky troops like Uncle Phil on a Christmas turkey - and all you can do is sit there and take it like a champ because your troops run at 2 mph and have a mind of their own.The game's biggest crime however is how broken it is as a piece of software. When I first fired it up, the screen was streched out of proportion and this couldn't be remedied through the in-game options. After managing to sort it out through wizardry, I went on to the play the game only to find that there is a near universal crash after the first mission. Though I found a work-around by trawling the forums like a peasant, the game still crashes at random once you get beyond the incredibly boring first mission, rendering all the time you watched your goons crawl painfully across the desert pointless.Bonus burns: the voice acting is absolutely terrible. For some reason the Pope is American and sounds like he has a mouth full of golden syrup. Also, although I've spent a few hours trying to get this turd to work, it says I've only played for 6 mins. Another sign of a well-polished piece of software.All in all, I really did want to like this game, but it is a disgusting mess and is probably the reason why the Crusades failed in real life.1 Deus Vult/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doesnt work. Crashes at the end of 2 hour long battles causing you to have to redo them. I would avoid this company (neocore) completely. Yhis whole series (King Arthur, KA 2, Kings Crusade) seems like it will be a cool alternative to total war. It almost is but everyone contains some sort of flaw that ruins game. In Kings Crusade it is the crashing.  In King Arthur 1 its the bizzare campaign design that lets you get 10 to 20  hours into the game before you realize that you did the quests in the wrong order and cant complete the campaign. In KA 2 its the strangely sluggis frame rate even on new rigs and the fact that they made the strange decision to completely gut the kingdom managment aspect.			",17,6,0,9,1,0,8

												ENGLISH&TURKISH REVIEW (Turkish review is in the comments)Great concept, multiple regional units for both sides, strong medieval atmosphere. Makes you feel like Saladin or a crusader if you are on the wrong side of things... But it does not really matter, because you can not get past first battle of either scenario. It just crashes. This game crashes more than the Bandicoot himself...All jokes aside, this game and Paradox in general is the real JOKE! Why? All they seem to care about is the DLC'n now. Where is that great Paradox these days? Yeah games are still solid but not fixing a well-known bug that makes playing the game impossible, is unacceptible. I am still a devoted fan of Paradox games and i buy every one of then (on sale though but does it really matter?). But this one really pisses me of, because as much as it seems like a bad imitation of Medieval Total War, it does have a unique character as a game. For a hardcore paradox and strategy fan, this game could have been a no-brainer.I am very dissappointed that i have to downgrade this great concept and not have fun out of it. If they somehow decide to solve this problem, i'd be glad to buy this back and liberate the holy lands!			",55,12,1,5,14,0,22

												I had bought this game on disk long before I had a Steam account or internet, and at the time was ignorant of the whole ""must download game through steam"". So, I waited, and then finally got internet and made a Steam account. The install took awhile, but I had been wanting to play this game for a long time. The initial start up took a very long time, and crashed once or twice before finally loading. The first battle ran painfully slow, though I don't have a great computer, it can run Medieval 2 Total War on highest graphics. The combat was sluggish and awkward, and the bloom effects were weird, hazing the picture really. I couldn't even finish the first battle of the game and it crashed when I tried to quit. You could say I was disapointed at the very least. I had high hopes, but they were not held up to. So, I would not recommend this, as a strategy game lover, this one might be good to check out in a demo, but I wouldn't buy it.			",23,1,0,9,2,0,15

												The next one based off of Crusaders Thy Kingdom Come (which was awesome).This one is great too.No serious deviations but lots of new stuff.Fun and great to play.  These are must-own games for strategy junkies.King Arthur the Role Playing Wargame (#1... not #2... don't buy 2) is a perfect game.  It's insanely fun and the Druids/Saxons DLC is great too.Strategy and kingdom managment junkies who also like RPG and Story based stuff (like choose your own adventure/choice making) will love these games.King Arthur is more story as opposed to this with kingdom managment.This game has some managment and some story (a little) but is mostly strategy/war gaming.I liked adding Joan of Arc to my game as a ""cheat"".Not really a cheat, just adding another hero to use.Saladin's campaign was just as fun.Both sides totally different and great.

												I've never played the Rome Total War series. Most war strategy games I play have some form of base building, so the only game I can think of to compare The Kings Crusade to is the Myth series of games released way back when. The Kings Crusade is a blast to play. It looks good, and sounds good even without a heavy coat of polish a higher budget games receives. You get to use the terrain to your advantage, are forced to make quick decisions even with the capability of pausingbefore and during battle to get your bearings. Units that survive can be upgraded RPG style, new units are being introduced and there little side qests and diversions to mix things up that reward the player with goodies and perks.There is even a faction system you must balance to try and get the best from all worlds, and this faction system really captures the historical context of the era and the main reason the subsequent crusades were not ultimately successful: Christandom was not united in its quest.Remember to save your game after each hour of play or else you will lost it to a windows run time error. There are bugs here with no fixes, but there are work arounds. If you have been playing for over an hour and the game hasn't crashed, SAVE! Luckily the missions don't take longer than hour, at least not so far. ",38,15,0,10,7,0,5
