												Dwarfs!? is a top down casual strategy game where you loosely control dwarves as they tunnel for riches. I played this game for about 2 hours and put it down as I was not particularly compelled to continue. The game isn't terrible; there are certainly far worse out there but the gameplay is just ""OK"" to the point where it's not worth playing in my opinion. There are several gamemodes but the main gamemode is called ""Arcade Mode"" where you essentially go as long as you can for a high score.  This game would be good as a tablet/phone game that I would play on the subway but as a PC game I need more of a reason to play this. Priced at $10, this game is far too expensive for what you get. Score: 5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An entertaining micromanagement game. It's a top-down RTS game combined with Lemmings. ""Dwarfs"" are automatically spawned from a base panel and dig through the dirt surrounding the base. You can give them simple movement commands and make them dig towards various caves or minerals throughout the map. That's a basic rundown, there are many more things you need to worry about but if you want a more in-depth look at how it's played, look up some gameplay.To those who enjoy going for high scores, and enjoy optimizing their skill in a somewhat complex game, I highly reccomend this game.I wouldn't reccomend this game to people who want a simple experience, or those who aren't patient enough. This game has a somewhat long tutorial to teach you the skills you'll need to master, and the game itself can be somewhat tedious near the end of a run.There's also no story, if you are looking for a story driven game... Obviously.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like watching an ant farm. Watch your dwarfs mindlessly dig for treasure while you keep them in check. But don't fall asleep because it's your duty to hold off the occasional water spout or lava leak while turning your warriors into cannonballs to fend off those evil minions. Don't forget to build an outpost or two to keep the ale flowing because digging is thirsty work. And make sure you keep your own ale flowing because playing this game sober is not recommended.

												A fun strategy/management game that can keep you occupied for minutes or hours.You are a babysitter to dwarfs. You use arrows, walls and dynamite to guide them towards treasures and away from danger. The dangers that await the dwarfs are lava, water and nasty creatures like goblins and spiders. And the dwarfs love looking for treasure, so much so that they will dig into a lava pit to find some. Fortunately you are given the tools to prevent this from hapening. You get guide arrows to switch their direction, dynamite to create holes for water and lava to flow in and walls to block the flow of water and slow the flow of lava. You can also seal up areas permanently by hardening rock, but this can cost a lot of gold (especially in the harder difficulties).With the game's multiple mode, difficulty and time settings you can enjoy a nice long high score game, or go for a quick 5 minute hardcore challenge. There is also an alternate game, akin to a carnival shooting gallery (throwing axes/shooting at side scrolling targets), which can be fun for a bit.For the achievement & perfect game collectors, this game offers a 2 for 1. Any achievement you get in the paid version will also be unlocked if you play the free version. The achievements themselves are fairly easy to get within a few hours. The only issue is that some of the achievements will not register in the paid version, unless you unlock them in the free version (you can meet the criteria in the paid version and not need to buy the dlc).Overall a nice game, 7/10. Definitely worth picking up in a sale. I wouldn't buy it out of sale (£7.99 / $9.99), but it may be worth it to some, so try the free version first.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very tedius, very aggravating, not very rewardingIn dwarfs!?, you control dwarves (No way!) as they mine to the debths of the caverns to get as much gold possible, the problem? THE DWARVES ARE MINDLESS IDIOTS!The game encourages you to let the dwarves do the work themselves, and makes controlling them very difficult as a way of forcing you to sit back and watch them work. But the mindlessly dig through ANYTHING, including the walls you build for their own protection! Their mindless digging can make the most trivial problems, such as a flood, to become a serious problem as you try to block them off with walls that they simply dig through. To seal off a flood, you have to spend gold to seal off the surrounding area and then bomb the entryway (and suicide bombing is the only bombing available) to make sure a dwarf doesn't dig through the wall blocking the flood, even though the wall blocks the flood just fine. Seriously people, if you can't control the dwarves then you're not really the one in charge are you? Did I mention how difficult it is to try and control them? (You can't actually do it, but you can try to) This game is just endless frustration due to the Dwarves constantly making montains out of mole hills. That just about sums up the whole problem with this game in that one sentance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, guess I should keep things short as I didn't play this much anyway...I wouldn't say this is a bad game, it seems like an alright time-killer, but I simply couldn't get into it.It's a very simplistic sort of an arcadic-strategy game, you'll get the hang of it fast enough with the tutorial (assuming you just read it all quickly and skip the weird dwarf monologues).You basically have dwarves under your control and have to dig around, make them rich and protect their\your base from danger.Again, can't say that's a bad game, yet I could think of some better ways to pass my time rather than watching dwarves doing an endless mining jobs and walking into their deaths in some water\lava\monsters caves. But that could be just me.Oh, well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, this game is neat. You have bunch of different modes to try out, all of them at least a tad entertaining. All of them have something to do with dwarfs. What's up with this game and dwarfs? Anyways, this game can entertain you for quite a while, although it can get a bit (read: insanely) frustrating as your ""minions"" are suicidal and dumb. But still, it's fun!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with  the review.

												This game is distinctly retro, and would probably have done well back in the early 1990s, on the Commodore Amiga or something. Unfortunately, it's very repetitive in nature. Basically, your dwarves dig at random, and sometimes they uncover water and it spews out to flood your tunnels. Lava does the same, only it's slightly more dangerous because it also eats through brick walls that you build in its path. And that's about it. Water or lava, and your efforts to dynamite it and plug it back up, while your dumb dwarves keep on multiplying, and finding new routes to burrow in to the lava or water. (Which kills them.)A real one-trick pony, this one. Obtained as part of a bundle, and only played to unlock an item in Tripwire's far more successful game, 'Killing Floor'. Now that's done, I doubt I'll play 'Dwarfs!?' ever again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't deny I enjoyed this. I played a good 4 hours of it.But the balance between control and escalation in difficulty is not very good and kind of makes the game as simple as tetris.You start off with your base. There are 3 types of enemies: Actual enemies(there are 3 types, bosses, small goblins and spiders, all as easy, since goblins and spiders are easy to get and bosses are based), water and lava.Your base pumps out 1 worker/half a minute or so who starts digging.After awhile you got so many workers that you cant control them, and you'll just let lose. They'll find lava and water which you'll end up walling off over and over since your workers are suicidal. Eventually you lose.I only recommend getting this if it goes on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like dungeon keeper 2 if all your minions were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that constantly attempt to kill you. There are only 2 buildings in the entire game, and 2 unit types. Issuing any kind of order costs you resources. The game encourges you to let the AI handle things, only the AI does a catastrophically terrible job forcing you to micromanage every unit. This micromanagement is awkward and clumsy, forcing you to waste even more resources just dealing with the interface. Do not buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Humorous managment game where you look after bunch of dwarfs while they dig their tunnels in search for gold and other metals. I put my time in Arcade mode and maybe some day I will try other modes too. The dwarfs never know where they are going and might just end up flooding their new tunnel with water or lava or even enemies and then you have to block away the tunnel and make sure no other dwarf open it up again. You can give the dwarfs orders where they should dig but they still like to do whatever they want a lot of time so mostly you are just trying to prevent everyone from digging their way to their deaths. The more dwarfs you have digging in and bigger your map is, more hectic the managing will be! It is lots of fun and even challenging on times! There is no story other than... dwarfs dig for gold. That didn't bother me but it might be problem for someone else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dwarfs!? Yes you heard correctly. Anyways, the game is a strategic tower defense game where you direct and control dwarves to collect minerals and explore caves.Gameplay:The main goal of the game is to defend your outpost, which is the center of the diggers, and explore as much as possible. Diggers will slowly come out and start digging in random areas. You can let them go loose, or direct them on where to dig. Each time they dig, you earn gold. Gold can be used to make more outposts, hire more warriors, or convert an outpost to have more digger dwarves come out. Warriors and Diggers can be directed to go a certain direction. However, the arrows will stay, which can direct wandering Diggers and Warriors to the same path.Each map has three main things to pay attention to: minerals, caves, and of course your outpost. Minerals are what rake the money in. Caves could contain treasure, but can also be full of danger, which is lava, water, minions, and even boss battles. It is important to defend your outpost from these obstacles, otherwise, it's game over.There are a couple of gamemodes: skirmish, base defense, campaign, and the basic arcade mode. There's a bit of variety in this game, but with a common goal.Controls:Controls are a slight hit-and-miss. The reason being is sometimes the clicks do not register when trying to set up dynamite and outposts. Another problem is that sometimes dwarves will ignore your commands on where to go. Just be sure to pay attention and make sure things are going through.Music:If you're used to medieval tones, then this is the type of music it has. It's a bit upbeat and relaxing...well...contrast to the higher difficulties you end up playing.Graphics:The graphics compare to a typical flash game that caters to a cartoony look. The game is overhead, but the art is still detailed with medieval tones.Story:Not much of a story, lad. But I think yer gonna enjoy the witty dwarf who guides ye through the nooks n crannies. What every dwarf loves is killin monsters, ale, and of course gold...the thing that ties the whole thing togetha. Keep everythin in order, kid, and ye'll have the thickest beard known to every dwarf!Overall:Dwarfs!? is a casual or challenging(depends on how you want it to look or play) tower defense game that could mean hours of fun to earn your medals and get the highest possible score. While the controls are a bit off, the gameplay is still fun and simple. Collect money and explore with many different gamemodes. With a classic medieval tone and dwarves that stay true to their heritage, this game can be enjoyed by people of all ages.Pros:-Relaxing Music-Simple game, but with many possible obstacles.-Variety of difficulties.-Variety of gamemodes.Cons:-Controls are a bit stiff sometimes.

												Ok so the only reason I ever played this game to start with was to get an item in Killing Floor lol. But as it just so happens to be, this isn't a bad little game. It's simple enough in design but can yield a nice challenge. Between the lava rushes and floods, mother nature can be one hateful ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game. You may think having only two environmental hazards would quickly become stale, but I didn't find that to be the case. They can be unforgiving. There are several modes in Dwarfs?! but for the most part your goal is to mine as much of the map as you can, without your base being overcome before the time runs out. In each game you'll have ups and downs contained within caves of unknown content until entrance that could either hold Gold, a Boss, mini-hoard, lava, or water. You can spend in game currency to use blocks that block off cave systems and prevent your workers from breaching the containment area but be warned, if you block off the entire system without first discovering it's contents there will be a penalty in the form of a deduction from your gold... an important item I may add. One tactic you may want to try is blocking off all but 1 square then send in 2 workers with dynamite equipped in case it's lava or water. In that event it's best to sacrifice a worker to make a drainage hole in the earth and completely sealing that hazard, which will give you a bonus. Along the way you may construct outposts with your gold and train warriors and workers. Good thing they put this in because the map is rather large and this will cut down on travel time during combat or intervention. In the harder modes controlling your workers becomes extremely important. There are more hazards to be found and they flow faster so having 2 or 3 workers tap into separate conduits will be a quick death for you. So that's the general idea, I'll let you explore the rest of the game for yourself :)Oh yeah, don't forget about the Killing Floor award, whatever it was. Happy gaming!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: When I recommended this game I was unaware of the weapon achievement that grants you a nice weapon unlock in Killing Floor. That alone makes the game worth the small price you'll pay for it. Seriously, give it a shot if you play Killing Floor. You may decide you hate it, but I don't think you'll regret unlocking that axe one bit.EDIT EDIT: Look, playing the game does not unlock the achievement for some reason, but they claim that owning the full version that you paid for in Steam and having your profile set to public so the servers can pick up the fact that you own it should unlock it automatically in Killing Floor. If you get it, it will appear right beneath DLC on your Killing Floor page as Dwarfs!? Promotional DLC. Good Luck. BUT if you have the free version, I think you have to unlock the achievement--which seems not to work for a lot of people. Check the forums. Good luck.Original Review: Addictive little arcade game about dwarves, not to be confused with that other more trendy game about establishing dwarven settlements. For what it is, it's a fun diversion when you're bored or need a little PTSD therapy. The limits eventually get old, but while it lasts, it's a bit of fun.

												It's okay... but kind of disapointing. I wish you had more control over your miners, as they tend to want to kill themselves, block off a lava area but not have enough gold to completly lock it off, and your miner WILL try every thing he can to open that water/lava shaft and kill EVERYONE and EVERYTHING, HE IS DETERMINED! HE WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOUR COMMANDS! HE WANTS TO DIE AND TAKE EVERYTHING WITH HIM!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT: When I recommended this game I was unaware of the weapon achievement that grants you a nice weapon unlock in Killing Floor. That alone makes the game worth the small price you'll pay for it. Seriously, give it a shot if you play Killing Floor. You may decide you hate it, but I don't think you'll regret unlocking that axe one bit.EDIT EDIT: Look, playing the game does not unlock the achievement for some reason, but they claim that owning the full version that you paid for in Steam and having your profile set to public so the servers can pick up the fact that you own it should unlock it automatically in Killing Floor. If you get it, it will appear right beneath DLC on your Killing Floor page as Dwarfs!? Promotional DLC. Good Luck. BUT if you have the free version, I think you have to unlock the achievement--which seems not to work for a lot of people. Check the forums. Good luck.Original Review: Addictive little arcade game about dwarves, not to be confused with that other more trendy game about establishing dwarven settlements. For what it is, it's a fun diversion when you're bored or need a little PTSD therapy. The limits eventually get old, but while it lasts, it's a bit of fun.

												This is repetitive but really fun. It's a casual 2D strategy Indie game which includes a bonus Tower Defense game-mode, and more. This game is more of a game where you run in the background whilst doing other things in the non-virtual world. For example: I love to paint my Games Workshop miniatures, so I play this game in the background, listening to calm, enjoyable music while i'm painting my miniatures. If my Dwarfs need help or require micro-managing so they won't release Doom, I pause my painting and micro-manage them. When it's all safe, I return to painting. The main game-play or game-mode is the, 'Arcade mode'. This is where you select a difficulty a time limit, so a random generated underworld spawns. Your Dwarfs will go mining anywhere they like, although you can set them paths to mine for a bit of gold. Caves will spawn in the map which can contain good or bad things or nothing for your Dwarfs. It could be an empty cave, it could filled with water of lava that will spread killing anything in it's path until contained or until it reaches and destroys your town. It could be filled with goblins, or even a boss goblin; 'Shaman'. It could be filled with treasure or with rich minerals to mine. Minerals will spawn around the map to be mined so it can be turned into gold.The 'Campaign' are basically challenges as well as a tutorial. The 'Skirmish' are basically bonus game-modes. The first one is 'Sandbox'. This is basically where you can play around with the underworld. Spawn in everything you like and mess around with the settings of things like: water or lava speed. You can make the world for your dwarfs to thrive, or just die. It's basically arcade mode but instead of a random generated world, you get to create the world before or during when your dwarfs mine, with no time limit.Rush mode is basically Arcade mode but with one difficulty and no time limit. The catch is however, new Dwarfs spawn all the time and you have 200 lives (so if 200 dwarfs die, you die/loose).Dark mode is like Arcade mode but there is only one difficulty and no time limit. However the catch is, everything that isn't mined is hidden. So you don't know where the minerals are or the caves.Endless mode is basically Arcade mode but you decide how big the map is as well as there is no-time limit.Carnival game mode is basically a bonus game mode. You are a dwarf and you have throw axes at moving targets. You can move within a small area but you only have 10 axes. This game-mode is fun to compete with friends to see who can get the highest score.The last game-mode is called 'Base defence.' This basically tower defence but with a twist. You get to create your own paths with digger Dwarfs. Whenever a portal spawns, just before the goblins spawn, a digger dwarfs spawns. He'll try to dig to your village the quickest way possible, but you can always create him your own paths, for some money. Whenever you kill a goblin, you get money. And like any other tower defence game, you can buy towers and then upgrade them.Overall I think this game is great and fun to play. It's worth getting this game if you like casual games.

												This is probably one of my favorite games on all time. If you like action puzzlers like flight control, droplitz, devil dice, bombastic and miner disturbance you will love this game. Dwarfs!? is nothing like dwarf fortress, the best way i can think to describe is a mixture of flight control and lemmings. Iv had allot of fun competing to positions in the high score board and i know i will continue playing for a long time to come.   The carnival event is the weakest part of the game, it was added a free dlc back before dwarfs was ""f2p"", its just a pointless little addition, completely disjointed from the main game (which i consider arcade mode to be the main game) The campaign made serves as a good tutorial but definitely isn't long enough to be a selling point. I had fun with it but its only 10 minutes long. The base defense mode is playable for a an hour or so but is very bare bone, if you have already bought the whole game it can be a bit of fun but i would not recommend buying it separately.  Iv found most of the fun or this game to be chasing a high score in arcade mode, its mostly free of hacked and glitched high scores which is great. There is a few scores at the top which are over 50,000,000 which i obviously glitched or hacked but i can attest that the rest are legit including all of mine where i can be found in the top 10 of most game modes.

												Imagine Dwarf Fortress if there was a magma pipe, aquifer, or megabeast every 30 squares, and your dwarves dig randomly of their own accord and are so stupid that they will willingly tunnel into magma and thus destroy your entire outpost if you don't quickly set up barriers. But that's where the Dwarf Fortress comparison ends. If you're expecting a pure strategy/sim hybrid like Dwarf Fortress or Dungeon Keeper, you need to play the demo before you buy because it's not one of those.Otherwise, pretty good action strategy game. Decent replay value; aside from the main 'arcade' mode, there's a set of five campaign maps that task you with mastering different game mechanics, four variants of normal play, and a tower defense game.

												[Note: If you're considering this game, I would recommend trying the free-to-play version, which is listed as ""Dwarfs - F2P"" on Steam. (This version is the full game; the F2P version allows you to buy individual parts of the game.)]Dwarfs!? is a strangely addicting game. If you enjoy arcade games, where the main objective is to beat your high score (or someone else's high score), you'll probably love this game.The way you score is by getting as much gold as you can, while trying to stay alive--but you're dwarfs aren't the brightest and will insist on digging into caves filled with water, lava, and monsters, so you'll have to keep a close eye on them, which becomes harder and harder as the game progresses.The game has four difficulties which can be played in 5, 15, 30, and 60 min sessions (but beware, you cannot save the game mid-session).The only problem I've encountered is in long games, where you have thousands of dwarfs in the field at one time, my computer starts to lag--which makes the game very difficult and frustrating to play.Overall, this is a fun, simple, casual game that can keep you entertained for hours or opened for a quick 5-minute session.

												To be honest, I expected something different from Dwarfs!?. What, you ask? Looking at screenshots I was sure there is more things to do - like building your own dwarf village, exploring limitless caverns and such. Well, even tho it was nothing like I thought it would be, I was still surprised. Maybe a little annoyed at beginning, because everything was happening way too fast: just got few dwarfs, ""gave"" them some arrows and there are plenty new ones, something happened on west and OH WAIT WHAT IS ALL OF THIS WATER AND WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I'M IN TROUBLE!? Everything that is happening in this game is fast - you need to have an eye on whole map every second. Little dwarfs are really curious and when you will leave them alone for few second they will for sure find some nest full of monsters, water or lava. Even tho it seems hard, in reality it's not, all you need if focus and some strategy. Once you will have both it will be really enjoyable adventure with this game and hardest difficulty levels will be easy and fun to play.I don't regret playing and buying this game. Challenges, minigames were really fun and free mode is where you can show your skills. There is free to play version of Dwarfs!? so be sure to check it before buying - it's a perfect way to decide if this game is for you or not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is too shallow for a hardcore game (and hey, you've got your Dwarf Fortess, why playing this game?), it is too random and making no fun for a casual-stile game (and there were a few of them not long ago which were better from this point). Besides, the AI was either done dumb or developers run out of money and time to make it nice, but anyway, those dwarves and goblins seem to be just brainless.

												This poor excuse for a game is quite possibly the worst $4 one could spend this holiday season. You are better off buying 4 dollars of cocaine and consuming it through your ear canal while engaging in violent non-consensual homosexual intercourse. At the end of the day, it does not matter which position you are in because I can guarantee that the visual experience that is ""Dwarfs!?"" (appropriately punctuated, I would imagine that the reader is getting anally penetrated while reading the word) is much less pleasing than either of them. I can not possibly express to you the level of masochism required to participate in this visual experience, however the dwarves' constant desire to become engulfed and drown in several common terrestrial liquids should give you at least a hint. Your warriors exhibit extremely debilitating cases of both autism and arthritis, failing to destroy even the most unthreatening shaman. Even telling your dwarves to move or not commit suicide costs massive amounts of currency. You literally have to place explosives and force them to blow themselves into smithereens to prevent them from destroying your own barriers and transforming your entire base into a pile of volcanic mush. Yes, this is an actual game mechanic. If you are still at all interested in this experience, I might also ask if you are interested in the evisceration of your internal organs by your worst enemy after a bad day at work. You will experience approximately the same amount of pain either way, but Dwarfs!? will also cost you 4 dollars. Unless of course you desire the free to play version in which you will also experience internal devastation, but as a filthy casual plebeian.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An extremely shallow Dungeon Keeper clone.  I am shocked this game is priced at $10; it is barely worth half that at best. I was looking forward to this game for some time and recently bought a bundle just for this game....what a disappointment. PROS:-It worksNEUTRALS:-Graphics are bare minimum.-A number of game modes, but several of them are more like a one time play level rather than a game mode (although some are randomly generated, several others are not).-Gameplay is very shallow and repetitive (just watch until your dwarves screw something up, then build some walls)CONS:-EXTREMELY simplistic game. It looks complicated on the surface, but the bulk of gameplay is build a wall or blow up dwarves. -Bulk of gameplay consists of you sitting waiting for something to go wrong (usually because one of your dwarves does something stupid).  -Lots of random involved.-Dwarves will destroy walls you just built to stop water....you can blow up the dwarf but this is purely aggravating design.

												An enjoyable relaxing game. You can play e.g. a 15-minute or 30-minute game before going to bed. It's a bit shame that (except for a few challenge modes) there's no other objective than a high score. Some story mode with different quests would be really great. Currently the game is fun, but you probably won't play it for twenty hours or more. I guess most people will get a bit bored after a gameplay of 5-10 hours and leave for another game.

												Dwarfs!? is simple. You have dwarfs, warriors and miners. Miners roam around the map randomly, straight into different hazards the game has to offer. Your job is to quide miners into treasures and ores, while avoiding different traps. Addictive. Dwarfs!? also includes a free-to-play version, which you should try if in doubt.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dwarfs!? Well now I always thought Dwarfs were supposed to be smart, but playing this game one would think they were the dumbest collection of inbred idiots ever... Now don't get me wrong this game is not that bad actually, it's a good way to pass time if you are in the mood for something similar the old ""Dig Dug"" game from Namco we used to play on our ancient Box style TV's... The aim of the game is to try and control your little idiot dwarfs in a big square of dirt with random black areas which are supposed to be caves, inside these caves can be a number of good or bad things like Lava (Bad), Water (Bad), Goblins (Bad), a Boss to fight (Bad), Sweet Blow Nothing (Bad) or 3 or 4 blocks of treasure (The only good thing in the game) And while you are trying to get your little idiots to get to the treasure they just keep on reproducing themselves up to a point ( Doesn't take very long actually - about 10-15 minutes ) where you are no longer in control of the game at all... you just have to try and keep an eye on the many warning messages that pop up to try and save your little idiot dwarf strongholds and village... My opinion these dwarfs are so stupid I think you would be doing them a favor to kill them. There is one good thing about the game though and that’s the mini games... well its not that amazing, to give you an idea, if you can remember playing the Olympics game on the old tv games where you had the archery challenge well this is the same thing, except you are throwing axes at 3 board targets with a bunch of wood poles getting in your way. Wow this is probably the most sarcasm I ever put in a review... so the verdict.THIS GAME IS CRAP ! My Rating - 4/10 - You have absolutely no control of the game whatsoever, you can just as well sit and watch the computer play its own game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unbelievably boring game. Dwarfs mill about aimlessly unless you direct them, which wastes your gold (for some reason) so you're encouraged to just...watch.There's one goal in this game: walk into the shiny rocks.There are two obstacles in this game, each with only one solution.-If there's water/lava, surround it with rock.-If there are monsters, direct your dwarves at them.If there's no decision points, if there's no action, if there's nothing interesting happening at any point...why are we playing this? I didn't go in expecting Dwarf Fortress Lite, but I expected a fun, arcade-y diversion. Dwarfs!? is flat, lifeless, and utterly without merit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Saruman the White reviewed this game a little while ago: ""The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.""I wouldn't hold it against him. In the beginning it's quite easy to keep them under controll. Set a path there, build a wall there. Then the dwarfs are everywhere and you're putting out fires left and right. By that I mean litteraly fires, because someone dug into a lava pit. Don't worry though, most likely another dwarf is just about to dig a hole into a waterfilled cavern. That will cancel each other out. If not,  it will at least kill these goblins too, that one of your dwarfs let into your kingdom. Next time, you could take a little more care of them. Would you, please.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game for the 'Gimli That Axe!' achievement in Killing Floor.When I have played this game I have more like it than before. It is a nice game. I know this game seems like simple, and you right. But it is not boringly simple.Good things:-More games mod in it.-The 'Arcade mod' is random. So you can play again and again.-Low hardware requirement.Bad things:-To the Killing Floor players: If you want get the 'Gimli That Axe!' achievement, you can't in there. But I suggest buy it if you want all achievement in 'Dwarfs?!' game too. Just install the 'Dwarfs - F2P' too and when you exited the 'Dwarfs?!' game just start 'Dwarfs - F2P' for a minute and the achievements will be synchronizing. I recommend this game those how like the simple or old style games, and those who want the 'Gimli That Axe!' achievement in Killing Floor.			",96,2,0,7,3,0,3

												In this game, you have to pay to tell your dwarfs where to go. And somehow, they always chose the longest way to get where you want them to go, making you pay even more. If you want them to take a specific route, to trap some lava for example, you have to pay even more, because if you don't, the dwarfs will kill themselves, walking straight into lava. Actually, they'll do that anyway, because if you don't tell them where to go, they'll wonder around aimlessly. This ruined my experience.			",38,10,0,4,5,0,8

												this game is just frustrating and boring at the same time.all you do and will do is babysitting a bunch of mole yes mole, they are stupid and blind.wen the game starts you bored to dead until you have enought ""moles"" then you busy cleaning the crap they do like floting everything with water or lave, running in hole, digging through YOUR wall you payed, running into enemy's, digging from the other side in to the same lave/water cave. In the end of the game your ""moles"" will manage to dig in so many water and lave caves that the notification system wont show all breach in a gigantic map and you big cave fills with water until you notice it by accident. build wall around it, it's not like the gigantic map filed wit ""moles"" will dig through YOUR walls. what you manage to secure a giant lake with holes? don't worry the grass that grows bigger will repair the holes. :Dside note:being a addictive game doesn't make it a good game, addictive doesn't mean good, gambling is a bad addictive game for example.

												This is a very addictive game. I've played it alot before I got it on steam, hence why my playtime is low.It has an arcade feeling to it, it's challeging and fun. You have to undirectly guide your miners to find treasures and your warriors to fight monsters. There's one thing though, your miners automatically mine, at any time they can open up a boss room, a water flow, a lava flow, a monster room... And if you are unprepared or have not managed your money very well, you will be in deep trouble.It could be repetitive to some, but for me, this game is well worth playing and I don't know why it's not more popular.

I was only by mistake that I found D spawned a dwarf, thinking this was a feature of the game I was using it for a while until my finger slipped and hit the C key. This ended my current game and gave me a 50 million score. I then tried other keys to find that you could get 1 million gold, spawn monsters and defenders. I gave up on playing a short while after.

												A fun, cute, casual game.  At its core this game is like a very basic version of pacman meets minecraft.  Dwarfs spawn continously and move about the mine map on their own.  You guide them and coax them to do your bidding to explore, gain money/increase score.  As more dwarfs spawn the harder it is to control them.There are no complicated elements to distract you from the main aim of the game which is to guide your dwarfs as they mine the map uncovering resources or caves with rewards or dangers.  You can build outposts with guards to fight off monsters, use dynamite to cut-off dangerous traps or turn earth to concetre to block of sections you dont want your miners to explore.  These simple mechanics mean you can get into the game very, very quickly.  However just because it is simple to play does not mean it is easy to master...  The game has a lot of depth with several game modes including a set of campaign challenges which plays like a tutorial that gets harder and encourages you to develop your technique.  These will become vital in the Arcade mode or the Skirmish challenges.  Gameplay remains the same throughout with the difficultly and the achievements being the driver for you to take on harder and harder challenges.Overall I found this fun if the last few challenges a little frustrating but, its great to start up if you just want some quick frantic fun for an hour or so.  It is repetitive with only the randomly drawn maps changing from game to game.  Though for what it costs its value for money.  Just dont expect AAA graphics. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a fan-tas-tic game ! I didn't expect something good, since it looked 'just' alright and I didn't exactly know what to expect. But it's the best €4,50 I've spent so far during this 2011 summer sale. Allow me to explain what you have to do in this game. You basically control (not directly, it's more like micromanaging) dwarfs who dig on their own. Along the way you find caves, which contain treasures (hooray !), water (nothing you can't handle, if you're quick), lava (prepare to spend your money), or enemies (boo ! boo !). Plus, you can get achievements by digging through 500 blocks, 1000 blocks, killing a shaman, things like that. It all adds up to your total score in the end. Even though it's a score-based game, I'm having lots of fun with the digging and managing. And it's always random. It's awesome ! It's similar to a lot of other sandbox games, since you have no real objectives. You just have to survive for xx minutes and try to do as much as you can. I LOVE IT ![Rating: 86/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Man, this is one of the best, and cutest time-wasters I've come across yet. Adorable dwarfs who dig for gold at a very slow pace, making them more adorable. This game also have different modes from Sandbox to Endless to even Challenges to test your skills you've leant from experience. I love the Arcade mode. Arcade mode is the mode where a randomly-generated map is made and your dwarfs will dig literally mindlessly to look for gold or any other materials. But be warned, apart from Trasure Caves, there are also caves that contain enemies, water that would flood your village and lava that would burn everything in your village. Your enemy will attack your base and kill all the dwarfs they come across. Fortunately, you have guards to guard your village a.k.a. base from evil.I would definitely recommend this game to those who love cute, time-wasting, offline games with a bit of curiousity and a small touch of adventure.

I would give it a thumbs down, but that seems a bit too harsh.  It did keep me around for an hour or two but after that I was done.  It is a bit of a really fast rts, It starts out slow but then it will get hard fast.  you have to manage a buch of little workers indirectly that randomly dig everywhere you need to keep them from digging into water or lava.  I got the hang of it but after a while it becomes impossible to manage everyone maybe thats the way its supposed to be but I couldn't really stay that interested.

												Dwarfs tries to be an arcady action game, but it just feels out of control. You control your dwarves by giving suggestions on where to dig, but overall they randomly mine. You only have so much attention to give to each dwarf, so while you are focusing on one side of the map, your dwarves are busy doing nothing on the other.Overall, it seems unplolished and isn't very fun to play.

												Damn dwarves, always digging too deep… Uh… Erm-ahem. Hi.If you’re reading this, chances are you’re interested in Dwarfs!?. Maybe you think it could be your kind of game. I have to start by saying that if you’re looking for something remotely like Dwarf Fortress, this is not it. Dwarfs!? is a completely unrelated casual game.With that out of the way, what is Dwarfs!?, really? Well, it’s a game about managing dwarves as they dig further and further from their home. If it doesn’t sound too hard, believe me, this job has a lot more excitement than you think.As the dwarves dig deeper, you’ll want to direct them towards minerals and treasure caves, which boost your score. However, they may also find monsters, water veins, or worse, streams of lava. On that event, you have to try and seal that path before the whole level is flooded and/or your main base is destroyed. This requires an escalating amount of micromanagement, but hey, just try to not die.And… that’s basically it, really. It comes with several modes, each of which has few different rules, but I’ll admit I spent most of my time with the default, arcade mode, which gives you a time limit (5, 15, 30 or 60 minutes) to explore the cave as far as you can and maximize your score. I could have stuck with the F2P version for that, but I don’t regret my purchase. It’s a pretty good casual game that I find myself coming back to every once in a while.…it could have done without the obnoxious voice acting, though.			",61,37,0,15,10,0,12

												This game is incretible fun!Basically you have your dwarfs who just digg wherever they want. You can set up arrows for them so they will walk in your direction, however that costs money so you can't issue to many orders at the beginning.You also have different caves where you can find gold... or bad stuff like bosses, lava or water.Basically the game becomes a micro-management game where you need to manage your dwarfs. Deal with the floods, bosses and still make sure you explore and get more gold.You have different dificulty settings & a different time. 5, 15, 30, 60 minutes game. In that minute frame, you need to make as many points as possible.You have local & online leaderboards so it's always a competition!You must try this :)			",713,204,18,96,136,8,129

												A DIFFERENT STRATEGY GAME.You don't have to care about resources, since every dig gives money and,  dwarfs are compulsively digging to random directions.Less complicated than other games, as AOE by example, but, still needs some experience before you can control everything together.Original ideas inside and not a bad game at all.It cames included in the Nordic Indy Pack so, welcome!.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Strategy game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are alot of resolution sizes available.You can play in fullscreen or windowed mode.There is color blind mode.There is a master volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.There is a voice volume slidebar available.Has Challenges.Has a difficulty settings.Has map size setttings.About the game.The game could be best seen as some top-down lemmings. Why lemmings? Because these dwarf miners are pretty stupid. They mine and dig in random locations and miners do keep spawning over time. Which will create a chaos if left unchecked. They wil dig into random holes, area's and other dangerous locations. You can make some contrl point arrows. But they will fade away overtime and they do cost money. Your dwarves are able to get under attack from enemies, die from environment, Train your units and find gold.There is sandbox mode.There is a save and load game available.Has an ability to temporary freeze the game movement.You are able to speed up the time.You are able to zoom in and out.There is an option ingame available.There is a table of contents available.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			",467,171,6,45,49,1,62

												Somehow I have nearly 50 hours.A pretty small game, but I had some fun with Endless mode or whatever. A lot of fun in fact. Since the challenge is being able to preempt lava and water coming at you from all sides, because your stupid dwarves are going to be doing their best to mine that stuff out so they can kill themselves.Like some early versions of Minecraft, lava and water grows exponentially when exposed to huge open spaces. And then never ever shrinks.There's not a lot to do in this game, unlike, say, Dwarf Fortress, so... no, you can't tap the lava for geothermal energy and heat to ensure your dwarves are warm.Game is a lot like a mobile game, really, so, I'm not sure I'd pay $10 for it. I got it from a Humble Bundle.			",433,58,5,45,25,5,63

												its a nice game to kill some time, i will say 6-7/10 score.it does have few annoying attributes like you have to kill your dwarf in order to use dynamite, your dwarfs are ""stooped"" they destroy your own placed walls(???) and fall into there own made dynamite holes (???) and i really dont see the point of this.another thing is you cant permanently made the time faster (like static toggle) which means that while forwarding the time you can't do some things like blocking lava\water caves...other then that its a fun game, try geting it on sale tho :)			",327,76,10,59,19,6,54

												This game is okay, its a bit of a laugh.I am a big fan of dwarf fortress and was very excited about picking this up. I had read about it before hand so I didn't feel disapointed about it being completely different, I think one of the developers said ""don't think DF, think lemmings"" (or maybe it was totalbiscuit, can't remember I'm afraid). Like lemmings, your dwarfs will happily walk to their doom or do something that screws up your entire game. This is where the majority of the challenge comes from and I think the game suffers for that a little. In order to help with that you can change the direction that your dwarf is digging with arrows, make an infintiely deep hole by sacrificing your dwarf (this will allow you to pour water/lava away) and hardening the walls which makes it impossible to dig through. These tools cost you a lot of money so its important to be smart about how you are spending. Yes, those rare crystals would be faster to get to using an arrow but if a dwarf uncovers lava in an open area then you are in real trouble. As the game goes on you will gain more dwarfs which will make earning money much quicker but also opens up problematic areas more quickly too.The nice things about it is that there are a lot of difficulty levels and it requires a lot of concentration. If you enjoy being challenged, you will find that itch scratched in this game. Another nice feature is that you set a time limit before you go in, great if you have a specific amount of time to burn. The graphics and music are nice too.Theres quite a lot of comedy here too. The narrator is voiced by one of the yogscast youtube starts. I'm not too into the yogscast myself but I know it has a lot of fans and some people will just eat that up! The acheivements are fun to get too and its very self aware in its humour.I give it 5/10, to me that's an average game. This doesn't mean I say you should completely ignore it, it's fine and it may turn out that you love it. I think I will pick it up from time to time as it does have an entertaining value to it, but unless its on a steam sale you might want to pass up on this one. I can imagine that people who don't like the ""hands off"" simulation game like dwarf fortress or dungeon keeper then the on purpose dumb AI could drive them absolutely mad. Personally I think that if you watched a gameplay video of this and you think it looks fun, then you will find it fun. I feel a little bad giving it an average score as there are a lot of fun nice little things here there just isn't too much of it, but what is here is very well polished.I'd love to hear what other players think.

												Not worth the money.Have tried all the various game modes and its all very repetitive with very few features. Have tried better flash games that was free to play with no microtransactions. Now I do understand that this is a casual game, but even so, there is so little Entertainment value.I gained this game from a bundle, if I had a choice of not having this game on my steam list, I would take it, since this titel is only cluttering my game list.

												Developed by an indie studio ""Power of 2"" and published by ""Tripwire Interactive"" known for ""Red Orchestra"" and ""Killing Floor"", this is a unique RTS of multi-tasking for single player, while you protect your base from lots of troubles, you simultaneously need to get more scores for online competition.The main mode of the game is Arcade, in which you aim to get high score for the online score board within limited time which can be set to 5, 15, 30, 60 minutes.You take the role of an overseer for dwarfs who randomly moves towards caves for minerals such as gold or silver and direct them at randomly generated map, the more minerals dwarfs get the higher points for score can be gained.While some caves contain gold or silver that give point for the score, others contain dooms you must stop to save your dwarfs such as lava or flood or monsters.Although these troubles can be stopped by putting arrows to direct your dwarfs, each arrow consumes gold which can be gained by getting minerals.In addition, each dwarf gains experience and levels up so careful plan and management for both resource and units are vital.With 7 other game mode and 4 difficulty levels and 29 achievements to unlock, this game can be your long time friend for its low price.Not only simple to play and easy to learn with tutorial but also has its depth which makes the game quite addictive, worth buying if you're ok with fast-paced RTS that will keep you busy during the play.Play F2P (free to play) version, and buy the full version if you like it, it's just for 2.5$ during 75% off sale!Purchasing the full version or unlocking an achievement by collecting a cumulative total of 40k gold on the F2P version, unlocks ""Dwarfs!? Axe"", a two-handed melee weapon for Berserker perk in ""Killing Floor"".(Japanese translation below)==================================================インディメーカーのPower of 2によって開発されRed OrchestraシリーズやKilling Floorで知られるTripwire Interactiveにより販売された、複数の作業を同時にこなす一風変わった1人用RTS、本陣を守りながら稼いだスコアを他プレイヤーとオンラインで競い合います。メインは制限時間内(5分、15分、30分、60分から選択可能)に稼いだスコアを他プレイヤーとオンライン上で競い合うアーケードモード、プレイヤーはランダムに生成されるマップを舞台に、無作為に壁を掘り進んで鉱物を集めるドワーフ達に監督官として指示を出してより多くの鉱物＝スコアを稼がせるのです。ドワーフ達は自動的に壁を掘り進んでゴールドを集めてくれますが、時には溶岩や洪水や魔物の群れといった災害を発生させてしまうのでプレイヤーが指示を出して助ける必要があります。矢印を設置することでドワーフの移動方向を変更できるものの、矢印は鉱物最終によって得られる資源ゴールドを消費するので無闇に指示を出せば良いものではありません。また各ドワーフは経験を得てレベルアップするので綿密な計画に加え資源とユニットの両方の管理が必要です。アーケードモードの他にも7つのゲームモードに4段階の難易度と29の実績があります。単純なシステムに分かり易いルールとやりこみ要素が加味され何度も遊べるのが売り、展開が速くプレイ中は休めないようなRTSが好きなら買う価値があります。無料で遊べるF2P版で試遊して気に入ったら買いましょう、価格に対して長く遊べる良作RTSです。75％オフセール中に買えばたったの2.5ドルです。なお製品版を購入するか無料版で累計40000ゴールド稼ぐ実績を解除することで、Killing Floorで使うBerserker用両手持ちの近接武器Dwarfs!? Axeが解禁されます。			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fun little Arcade/Sim/Strategy game. You start out with a base, which is constantly generating miners which will go out and mine on there on, usually in the general direction of minerals. You can also set down a path that the Dwarf, and any other Dwarf that steps on the path will follow. This is great for getting them to go mine the good stuff. Eventually it gets to the point where there's simply too many miners to micro manage, which is fine and part of the fun. They'll eventually, whether purposely or accidentally  mine into a water reservoir. You have to quickly wall it off and mark the tiles surrounding it as a ""don't mine this!"" warning, else it'll drown everyone. They'll eventually also mine into lava, which acts almost the same, except it'll burn through your man-made walls, so you have to make a hole in the floor, using dynamite and a Dwarf sacrifice, then mark the walls with a no-mine warning. You have to be quick though, since Dwarfs move slow and the lava needs to be secured before it burns through all your walls.It's fun just mining around, then suddenly one of your Dwarfs off screen will tunnel into lava, then you have to rush to fix it.It's a fun game, though perhaps a bit overpriced at $10. I recommend playing the F2P version, and if you like that, buy the paid version, which offers much more. Though try to get that on sale also.			",514,157,9,113,76,5,171

												Although I'm not a real 'casual'/'arcade' game fan and although I was afraid the babysitting (dwarfsitting? >.<)  could get very boring, I actually really like this game. There are 4 flavours of the main game mode: 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes. This makes this game very suitable for short sessions, but it is also possible to have a nice, a bit more complex 1 hour long session. The goal is to reach the highest score and be the player with the highest score in the world, so it is also competitive in a way.Very addictive!			",237,32,5,22,19,1,36

												Great little game that you can sink some time into. You can do the campaign which is basicly a challenge mode, the tower defense or ""base defense"" mode which is unique because it allows you to build your maze with the money you have for your towers, skirmish which consists of different variations of the main game such as dark mode or only have 200 dwarfs die, and of course, you have the main game mode or arcade mode which allows you to let your dwarfs dig around and find you tresure! I reccomend this game because of the varying game modes and, because there is nothing more aggravating than not noticing a creeping lava flow 15 minutes in. Then, try as you might, you cant contain the lava and you lose the game.			",153,21,6,31,28,3,42

												First off, a note;I'm incredibly biased towards this game - a half of my favourite podcast (Simon - YoGPoD) does all the voices in the game. Hilarious.A very cheeky RTS in it's own right. The campaign has an increasing level of difficulty, some borderline impossible at times - depending on how smart you are with your limited Dwarven friends. Sometimes they're smart, travelling to the nearest ore and making you plenty of money - other times their route takes a turn for the worst and enemies will filter through.It's a great timewaster, like most games I review - but put enough thought and energy into it, and you'll realize the game can open up a few doors of complexity not found in even AAA games.

												I heard about this game because Simon from the Yogscast did voice acting for it, and I was watching the Yogscast religiously at the time. The game itself is very straight forward and has a good variety of settings that allow for a few good rounds of playing before the game gets boring. I did enjoy the game, however simple it may be, but unless you really like flat, tunnel exploration, dwarf games, then this game is probobly not for you. If you can get it cheep, such as through Humble Bundle, them pick it up because it is a bit of fun and you can get some quick enjoyment out of it, however do not expect it to be overly emersive. I would compare it to a flash game like Flappy Bird, Temple Run and so on because it could be addictive to some people but in the end will not be a lasting hobby for any one. I will recommend it as a game because I did enjoy it, however I would not spend more than $2 on it.			",81,15,2,11,12,2,23

												Dwarfs!?, a game about mining precious metals trying to get the highest score possible within the allocated time, simple right? No, this isn't as easy as it sounds since hazards appear fairly regularly on higher difficulties requiring you to pay attention to a multitude of things at once (Lava, Water, Monsters), while also trying to prevent your dwarfs from committing suicide (Mining into lava spilling it everywhere) destroying everything you've worked hard to achieve with one small oversight that can be incredibly frustrating. To keep your stupid dwarfs alive requires intensive micromanagement of the units, and with up to a thousand dwarfs on the map at one time, it gets pretty chaotic, extremely fast when you can only control one at a time. Knowing that while you're fixing one problem, that some idiot dwarf elsewhere on the map is plotting to kill everyone while you're not looking.For the low price of this game, along with a free version you can try out as much as you want (Basically the whole game minus harder difficulties) it is hard to complain for the few hours of enjoyment I've gotten out of it.

												It's very hard to put Dwarfs into words that properly describe it. It feels like a combination of Lemmings, Terraria and Lord of the Rings. Essentially you play a dwarf overseer watching over constantly spawning dwarfs as they dig their way in the earth in search of caves that could contain treasures or peril such as monsters, water or lava. It's up to you to dig up the treasures, train warriors, neutralize threats to your base and direct your dwarfs where you see fit. Thankfully the game doesn't require a lot of micromanagement which makes for a game that is deep and exciting at the same time. The game features multiple modes for a lot of replay value and even ... a tower defense mode. Definately recommend this game!			",511,204,20,89,71,8,100

												I originally came here like many others to get the Dwarfs axe and the achievement for Killing Floor, however I brought the full version of the game during the autumn sale, however to get the Gimli That Axe! achievement you must play the free to play version. But I will state for thoses that may wonder both the full and free to play version share between each other is all progress, score and achievments.In the game you have the campain, challenges which tests out your skills. You have arcade mode which has easy normal hard and finally tedi difficulty. You have base defence which pretty much says it in the title, quite a fun experience, also there is a bonis mode which has a ray of diffrent game types, from sand box mode to throwing axes at moving tartgets at the carnvial. Lastly you have the score menu which shows all your scores, achievments, medals and so on.Even though for me I don't play fast paced arcade games, however I found myself really enjoying this game and I would say if you are intrested, try the free to play version if you are not sure. If you got a few hours spare and need something with a diffrent experience, try it out.			",36,1,0,0,4,0,2

												TL;DR: Casual lemming manager. Once you get over the tutorial it's a quite okay managing strategy game.Hi mate! Do you like Lemmings? Because that's what Dwarfs basically are, mindless, gold digging lemmings. Get in here and you'll get to be their overlordseer! For good measure, in the tutorial missions you'll also get a grain of rowdy men (or dwarves) talking a bit like pirates or woodchucks, or that's how I imagine people like that would speak. Voice acting sounds horrible. Tutorial's fine otherwise, and the game turns out not too bad either.In Dwarfs!? you control the mindless horde of dwarves on their quest for digging gold and minerals while protecting your base from monsters and natural hazards. Of course, you could just slack off because handing out orders costs precious gold. The dwarves will work independently and bring gold into your coffers. To direct them just makes them go where you want.So why bother? The mine is full of unknown caves and precious minerals. Minerals bring lots of gold and dwarves will only occasionally find them independently. Also, caves contain either treasure or hazard in the form of monsters or sources of rapidly flowing water or lava. All will destroy your base if you don't stop them. So you got to be ready for some overseeing.For monsters you need to send in warriors: you can either build a fort near or send a team in with a catapult. How that works is beyond me, but the warrior dwarves seem unaffected by the flight. For water or lava you got to seal the passage before it overflows your base. Unfortunately (and that's the point) the dwarves are mindless and they will eventually open up more holes for the flows. Your walls and wall sealing techniques will counter these, but usually you need a dwarf to go over there and go all kamikaze with a dynamite to finish the job. Tens or even hundreds of dwarves die each game.Annoyingly, when something (usually bad) happens, you'd of course want to go there immediately. There's usually an icon showing you where it happens and clicking it will get you there instantly. However, there's no button to get back to where you were and if you don't click it fast enough, you'll have to go find it yourself. If it was water or lava, you're probably screwed for that mine.Several game modes will keep you busy: arcade is the classic mode with several difficulty levels that affect the action costs and the frequency of hazardous caves. The hardest setting is actually very difficult indeed requiring loads of overseering to survive. There's also a sort of tower defense mode, a mode with super fast spawning dwarves, a dark mode where you can't see the caves or minerals (very difficult) and a couple of achievement yielding challenges. Plus a meager mini game where you shoot moving boards like in the games of de olde.Curiously this one and the F2P version are considered different games: still, the achievements are transferrable between the two versions so you get 2 perfect games if you can ace this one. F2P version does not contain the most difficult settings and the silly mini game so that's basically what you're paying for. Top Leaderboards are a joke though, as it seems someone has acquired a ludicrous and curiously regular amounts of points in all of them.I recommend it for casual game sessions because I generally enjoyed hoarding the achievements. I'd recommend getting it on sale though, 50 % discount or better. However, if someone asks you to Dwarf in their mine, just don't: the job safety is just not cut for it.

												Lemmings meets tunnels and dwarves.Dwarfs!? is top down 2d strategy game developed by Tripwire Interactive. You play as an overseer whose goal is to manage the dwarve's mining operations and make sure things go smoothly.As an overseer you have to control the safety of your mine through moving units, dealing with environmental hazards and building new structures. Gold is the main currency in the game. It is obtained by simply letting miners detroy blocks on the map. Miners will go off on their own detroying blocks and earning gold and aren't all directly controlled by the player. However, the direction the dwaf is moving in can be manipulated by selecting them and draging  (which creates a path) in a direction to make them move somewhere else. This can't be done sparringly however as it costs gold and the further the direction you send the dwarf, the more it costs. That is why it is best to let the dwarves do their own thing and simply resolve problems when they arise (like lemmings). There are also traps such as water and lava (which floods the mine). When they reach your town hall, the game ends. To deal with this, you have to block the entrance with walls. Lava will break down walls over time, so you have to set explosives to create holes for lava to fall into. Further hazards are enemies such as goblins, spiders, skeletons etc which can be found within the mines. To help deal with these foes you can recruit soldiers. All units gain experience as they complete their tasks, which makes them perform better when they level up. Besides building walls and dynamite, you can also build outposts. Outposts can be used to train your soldiers which increase health and damage. Training takes time and the more time it takes, the more gold it costs.There are plenty of game modes to play. Campaign involves completing challenges which range between getting a certain score, number of units or defeating foes with limited troops. There is also a tower defence mode, where you have to defend your town hall against waves of foes through clever tunnel and tower placement. Arcade mode has you explore a massive map in timed game, trying to get the highest score. Skirmish includes a variety of different modes including a carnival game (where you have to hit the targets) and endless mode (play a 60 minute game). With all theses game modes available, there is plenty of replayability.Audio is decent. The music is alright and gives a somewhat light-hearted medieval feel. Voice acting from the tutorial guy is decent as well.Graphics are dated. Textures don't have alot of detail to them and the models are basic.If you enjoy games where you can sit back and let your workers do most of the work, and solve issues when they occur, as well as having plenty of game modes, this game is for you.

You can also set down a path that the Dwarf, and any other Dwarf that steps on the path will follow. This is great for getting them to go mine the good stuff. Eventually it gets to the point where there's simply too many miners to micro manage, which is fine and part of the fun. They'll eventually, whether purposely or accidentally  mine into a water reservoir. You have to quickly wall it off and mark the tiles surrounding it as a ""don't mine this!"" warning, else it'll drown everyone. They'll eventually also mine into lava, which acts almost the same, except it'll burn through your man-made walls, so you have to make a hole in the floor, using dynamite and a Dwarf sacrifice, then mark the walls with a no-mine warning. You have to be quick though, since Dwarfs move slow and the lava needs to be secured before it burns through all your walls.It's fun just mining around, then suddenly one of your Dwarfs off screen will tunnel into lava, then you have to rush to fix it.It's a fun game, though perhaps a bit overpriced at $10. I recommend playing the F2P version, and if you like that, buy the paid version, which offers much more. Though try to get that on sale also.			",514,157,9,113,76,5,171

												Great game to play if you want to feel completely out of control. No micromanaging here! Watch your dwarfs dig around and drown themselves or unleash a horrific amount of lava flowing toward home base. This game is basically 100% damage control once you get enough dwarfs out there digging around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I originally came here like many others to get the Dwarfs axe and the achievement for Killing Floor, however I brought the full version of the game during the autumn sale, however to get the Gimli That Axe! achievement you must play the free to play version. But I will state for thoses that may wonder both the full and free to play version share between each other is all progress, score and achievments.In the game you have the campain, challenges which tests out your skills. You have arcade mode which has easy normal hard and finally tedi difficulty. You have base defence which pretty much says it in the title, quite a fun experience, also there is a bonis mode which has a ray of diffrent game types, from sand box mode to throwing axes at moving tartgets at the carnvial. Lastly you have the score menu which shows all your scores, achievments, medals and so on.Even though for me I don't play fast paced arcade games, however I found myself really enjoying this game and I would say if you are intrested, try the free to play version if you are not sure. If you got a few hours spare and need something with a diffrent experience, try it out.			",36,1,0,0,4,0,2

												Dwarfs!? is a surprisingly fun ""minimal control"" game, where the aim isn't so much to tell your dwarves miners where to go, but more steer them in a certain direction, and clean up after their inevitable messes. You're mostly playing damage control, and you'd be surprised how addictive it can be.I recommend it if it's on sale. At full price though, I'd be a little more hesitant.			",492,181,4,114,68,5,82

												This is one of those games you play where you enjoy it enough to play for hours, you tell yourself you will definitely play it again in the future, then realize it's for some reason still installed years later and you haven't played it since. Ultimately, think of it as a baby sitting simulator more than a strategy game. You're not managing an army of dwarfs, you're running a daycare center. Some of the kids thinks it's a good idea to dig up a hole where water comes from, forcing you to build blockades or marking various areas as such. You will realize that, the more they expand, the more frustrating it is to manage. Unfortunately, the game is far too laggy for me to play now... for some reason. The frame rate is unplayable. I do not know why suddenly this is a problem, I blame cancer. Unfortunately, google doesn't provide helpful support. I think it has to due with the forced software install when launched. Since google doesn't help with my issue, the forum has no solution to the issue or even the issue being reported, and the fact the forum has been dead for over four years, I'd say I will never be able to play this again. Buy at your own risk.Overall, I recommend this game, but on sale for 75% off. Oh yah, not all achievements work and you're required to play the demo to unlock them. Have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an ok game, I probably wouldn't buy it stand alone, but with the Tripwire bundle it's a nice neat side dish.			",126,14,0,4,7,1,15

												Great game to play if you want to feel completely out of control. No micromanaging here! Watch your dwarfs dig around and drown themselves or unleash a horrific amount of lava flowing toward home base. This game is basically 100% damage control once you get enough dwarfs out there digging around.			",81,6,0,3,6,0,8

												Great little game that you can sink some time into. You can do the campaign which is basicly a challenge mode, the tower defense or ""base defense"" mode which is unique because it allows you to build your maze with the money you have for your towers, skirmish which consists of different variations of the main game such as dark mode or only have 200 dwarfs die, and of course, you have the main game mode or arcade mode which allows you to let your dwarfs dig around and find you tresure! I reccomend this game because of the varying game modes and, because there is nothing more aggravating than not noticing a creeping lava flow 15 minutes in. Then, try as you might, you cant contain the lava and you lose the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Horrible game about poorly drawn art, bad voice over, B-grade jokes combined with lifeless mobile/flash looking pile of should-be-free2play crap. It's a great game if you like terrible games.			",371,124,6,83,22,5,60

												When it comes down to it, there just isn't enough depth of gameplay for this to be gripping or at all worth Ten dollars. There's not enough player agency, and the gimmick of no control often feels more frustrating than it does interesting.  ",40,9,0,17,14,0,38

												How can one not have fun in this game? It is basically a top view camera and almost exactly like Lemmings, whith a couple of cool little tweaks. I can play this game for hours and still have fun with the randomly generated levels, campaign missoins, and just about everything else about this. I would reccommend this game to just about everyone.			",100,8,1,9,5,0,5

												Hilarious game with a bountiful amount of gamemodes. Purchase this game and you get hours of fun, it's matches can be set with timelimits so you can play a quick 5 minute or go for a hour long adventure. It's highly addictive with its many dwarve jokes and fun. I'll never get tired of this game no matter how many times I strike Lava.			",82,3,1,5,8,0,3

												Theres nothing very captivating about it Tbh.It Would be better if there was a little more too it and the way you interact with the dwarfs wern't so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Feels like they've tried to go their own approach on how these type of games work and it's just made it confusing and boring.Probably won't play much of this... maybe when an update comes out but even then i'd consider using my downloads for something else.
