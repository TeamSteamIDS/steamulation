												I think as a spin off game this game can very adicting to play! its fast paced and lots of familar weapons hope you guys feel the same i know this is short but thats all i can say well the puzzle mode is a bit too hard for my taste seriously its seems like this was made by satan! But i give this game a 7/10 yeas i know i ranked this higher than worms 1 but sry guys thats just how i feel with this. This games graphics are fantastic as well as the music very catchy! but i do reccomend this game if u just want a lil fast paced vs game its not exactly like worms but i like this spin off!

												I can not really recommend this game.   This game is not exactly made for single player.  Of course,  you can play on your own here but I thought the fun factor of this game was much higher with a friend playing the game on same PC.   About controls, I think this game benefit better with a gamepad rather than keyboard which was what I was playing with.  I have this game in my library from the Worms' humble bundle.  I think this game in the series was quite underwhelming compare to other games in the series despite the different genre of this game.   If you do not have any games from Worms' series and are looking into this game, I would suggest you look else where for similar kind of gameplay.  Unfortunately, I would use 7.99 price tag against this.  It is a bit old game that did not age well.  I felt 4.99 price tag at most would have suffice. My rating:  if single-player, I'd say 3.5 / 10.  With a friend for fun, as high as 6 / 10 at best.			",123,17,2,42,38,2,53

The game has an entire (and completely pointless) SP campaign, but if you want to have some real fun, you WON'T play it! XDLike I said before, it's a MP gem, nothing else.			",92,19,1,1,5,0,6

												I am disapointed. That there are so many bad reviews on this game. I honestly feel that this is a great multiplayer game(2player) - and it also has a sadistically challenging campaign ""puzzle mode"" that is extremely rewarding for the solo players. The controls and movement in the game are physically realistic. This game takes skill to be good at. Give it a try- just torrent it or something(jks hehe).			",83,10,7,7,11,1,10

												This game is looked upon as a bad game.But in my opinion, it's a really good hidden gem hidden inside Team17's library of games. Like I am very surprised that not a lot of people play this game. I can see why but I think this game is going to make a comeback on the debate.All I suggest is that you play this game for a good couple of hours and you'll think differently about it.Sure the single player is looked upon as either being too hard or boring, but I only play for multiplayer because that's where it's really at.Multiplayer has a few modes to play and even more to unlock. And the character selection isn't just drab worms. For in-fact we have Boggy B himself in this little number, as well as a variety of different characters too.I remember playing this game when it first came out on the PS2 and I have to say I loved playing multiplayer with a couple of friends.The only thing I would say is that if you do decide to play multiplayer against a computer player (as there is that option) their A.I. is up and down. More up than down.When it is down, it won't know what to do because there is so much on their interface. But when it's up and running, it's really good. It will attack you, call power-ups like a human player and in general play a good mock round of the game!All I can say is give this game a try. Even if you're not a huge fan of games like this. There is some satisfaction to be found if not a lot.			",52,6,4,7,9,2,13

												This is a boring and generic old match 4 style puzzle game that has really nothing redeeming about it to bother spending time or money here.I got this game with a humble bundle for $1, but I'm shocked to see that the developer wants almost $9 CDN for this title on the store page.This game came out in 2002 according to the store page and it really shows it's age here. There are very limited visual settings and gameplay options.The graphics are decent for such an old title, but the gameplay is really unpleasant and simply not fun.You control a character in a boat, shooting a bazooka style weapon at blocks, trying to match colors and generally clear the screen in a time limit.There is also a battle style game where you match colors and use weapons against each other but it's really nothing special.Pros:-Bright colorful graphics, decent music and sound effects-Lots of puzzles if you actually have fun there may be a lot to do here-2 player local competetive-Supports Steam OverlayCons:-Gameplay is incredibly boring and unusual. Controlling a boat while aiming and avoiding attacks from above is not fun.-No Online Multiplayer, No Steam Achievements, No Cards, No Fun.-Character design is lame compared to other worms titles.I'm not a huge puzzle game fan, but the few I have played have been much better than this.Don't buy this game at full price, and if you get it in a bundle you may quickly find it to be a waste of time too.

												If you're thinking about getting this for just the single playerr experience.. then i'd say avoid at all costs. Unless you like being angry, frustrated and doing the same levels over and over and over and over and over again. Game is made by satan. Can't say anthing about other modes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Small, somewhat casual Worms-spinoff.Fun when playing against a friend for a couple of hours.Graphics is outdated and max res is 1024x768.Also does not support controller.So don't buy at full price (which is ridiciously for such an old game anyway), but feel free to grab at a sale :)			",153,26,6,44,44,1,61

												A crappy version of bust-a-move with no windowed mode to allow you to watch something else while you play.The controls feel awful and most of the minigames are really bad. The most interesting mode was VS., but that got boring after a single game.It feels like this is one of those old games that publishers just dump onto steam without updating or caring if it is any good just to get some essentially free money.

												Game is simply boring. Nothing new here and the controls are terrible! I've had a lot of trouble just finishing the tutorial. The Worms theme is nice but that's it. Not worth the asking price of 9$ CDN. Worth 1 or 2 dollars, not more.You can configure a gamepad with this game but the graphic options are limited to 1024x768 in streched mode at best.I haven't tried the two player mode yet but I doubt we'll have much fun with it.

												Boring and OLD block blasting puzzle game, with Worms theme. The age really shows, and resolution is terrible 1024x768. I got this from bundle so no money lost in here, but I wouldn't recommend buying as you can get a lot better games for free for your mobile.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The tutorial alone took me 17 minutes and it just felt like it was going to go on forever, but after that there is nothing left to learn but strategy. I've played this before and I thought I'd try out the keys but next time I'm mapping a comtroller anyway. Beside the tricky keyboard action, which is actually bunched together perfectly on my laptop, there is no graphical adjustments beside the initial resolution, it's an older game so it runs on anything, As for a Worms game it is confusingly not like aaaaany of the others. Worms Golf is better, incase you wondered. I got this for frizzle on Steam Gifts. meh 5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found the puzzles to be more twitch difficult than actually intuitive with close to unfair timers for many levels where your best bet is to just continue to restart the level continually until you memorized the execution.  Overall the sounds and themes of the Worms franchise is here and fans of that may enjoy it but the overall gameplay is a bit lacking in this offshoot from the main franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only versus mode is fine. You can play this game against a friend on same keyboard in split screen. I didn't like other modes. The game doesn't support multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
