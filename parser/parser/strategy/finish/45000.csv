												Sol Survivor is one of my top favorite tower defence games (defence grid is my 2nd fav), Sol doesn't really have much of a story to it but it makes up for it with it's sheer number of tower types and possible tower combinations which is in the 1000's.It has a good multiplayer system with modes like co-op survival and head to head wars and has quite a large number of maps to play them on and in a recent update a level creater was released.If you enjoy tower defence games Sol Survivor is one you definitely need to get!

												A game any TD fan needs to have and play. SS has a lot to offer and gives you so many options (after you get access to different commanders who each have their own combination of towers/powerups) on how to approach each level. It even has multiplayer vs and co-op. Brilliant game with a lot of depth and replay value.Only thing that bugs me is you can't fast forward.			",2199,857,88,271,226,28,362

												This is a classic tower defense game that copies significant features from Defense Grid: The Awakening.  There are numerous uncanny similarities.  That being said, there are many worse formulas to copy than Defense Grid, and I highly recommend this game as well as an excellent entry in the Tower Defense genre (but play Defense Grid first).  It doesn't do a lot to differentiate itself, but it executes well on the basic Tower Defense tropes... tower building and placement, tower synergies, etc.The campaign is relatively short, but there are numerous ways to replay the same levels giving it longer legs than it would otherwise have.It is a solid tower defense game that deserves attention.  That being said, if you're only going to play one Tower Defense game, it should still be Defense Grid.			",380,53,16,88,49,7,122

But be forwarned at the one hour mark the npc's get super hard to kill which i consider a sad thing as were near the end of the game. But if u have someone that isn't good at games but still want to play with them this is the game for you, you can talk about where to place towers what to place in other words you can interact with each other and thats the best part.

												Sol Survivor is an excellent tower defense game that has a lot of replay value.  The ability to customize your loadout, the plethora of towers and weapons available, the freedom to place towers where you want, the various multi-player modes...all of these things serve to keep me coming back for more.  It's definitely worth its $9.99 price tag, though there's a demo available if you still aren't sure.

												It may not have the razzle-dazzle of more recent tower defense games, but Sol Survivor is a solid entry in what is a crowded genre. Cadenza Interactive does an excellent job in delivering a graphical style that is both elegant and visually appealing. I never felt like I wasn't able to identify what each turret's function was even in the thick of battle. I especially like that each type of turret damage is color coded, allowing you to easily spot where areas of your defense may be lacking in certain damage types. Piercing turrets are yellow, concussive turrets are orange, support fields are green and electrical damage is blue. It affords an interesting ""temperature"" to a fleshed out defense and makes each level a paint-by-numbers process of constructing creep murder.The soundtrack is exceptional, and I must take a moment to point it out. It's not heartpounding, thrilling or action-y. You play the role of an ensign, rapidly rising through the ranks in a battle for humanity's survival. The music fits that theme. It's immersive, sad, and desperate. Kudos to the composer, because the soundtrack is amazing and fitting in every way.Some tower defense fans will balk at the lack of ""mazing"" or ""zoning"". Each map already has its path laid out a la the original Warcraft tower defense maps. You simply place your turrets along the path and attempt to capitalize on the various types of damage you have available and the various creeps you are facing. As above, each tower can deal a certain type of damage. This damage is more or less effective against the various types of creeps, so planning your resource expenditure is necessary for a successful defense. Where Sol Survivor lacks the strategy of ""zoning"", it makes up for it in the addition of support powers. Each field commander brings a variety of support abilities to the table which can either be used to shore up a weakness in your tower selection or to bolster an already solid defense strategy. Your satellite arrays adapt to the support powers you use which allows them to level up over time, increasing their range of effectiveness, power and recharge time. The missions are carefully balanced to allow for this feature, making it necessary to take an active role in combat (rather than simply laying down towers and waiting for enough mass to upgrade or place more).Sol Survivor also features multiplayer co-op, which is mind-blowing. I have yet to see another tower defense game offer up the same, and the fact that it has slipped under the radar is disappointing. You will be hard pressed to find partners (there are rarely any random people hosting an open lobby) but the playerbase is still active and you can find partners on the discussion hub. You can also send me an invite. I'm always willing to play.All in all, Sol Survivor is an excellent game. It looks gorgeous, has an amazing soundtrack and it definitely has a story to tell. It may not have voice acting or other fancy features, but the gameplay is solid. I highly recommend it.			",1008,210,12,156,61,5,116

												Sol SurvivorSol Survivor is a tower defence game in which the goal is to hold off an invading alien horde consisting of organic, cybernetic, armoured and air units hell-bent on sucking the souls of your helpless colonists. Worried? You should be! Don't despair as you have been issued with an extravagant variety of turrets including shotgun, machine gun, laser and rocket to name but a few as well as a range of support towers to enhance the abilities of neighbouring weaponry. If that wasn't enough to keep you busy, you have a choice of special abilities that can be called in from off map such as fire bombs and nuclear missiles to aid you in your struggle.I have been loving this game after picking it up in the Steam Sale. It's a simple concept but well executed. The graphics are good for the genre so should be more than playable no matter what system you're running. The multi-player co-op function is incredibly fun as it adds a lot of replay value to the maps and missions although it is still highly addictive going it alone. The hordes vary depending on the amount of players as well as the difficulty level. You can choose from the standard difficulties or an endless assault (my current record on that is 35 minutes!). Personally, I would like the option of choosing a specific amount of waves as there is a not a big difference between the easiest mode and the most difficult in terms of numbers of waves. As a side note, the soundtrack is sublime. This game is worth every penny of the £1.99 I paid for it in the sale and still would be worth it even at the full price of £7.99 (at the time of writing).If you love tower defence games, you'll love Sol Survivor!

												Sol Survivor is yet another indie Tower Defense game. They really are spitting them out on an assembly line these days.Sol Survivor is one of the better examples though as it takes great care to provide you with a multitude of different play-styles and tactics as well as decent multi-player component although it's a bit depopulated these days.The rather long campaign provides you with the option of choosing which commander to play as which in turn changes which turrets and abilities are available to you. Everything from the standard ""Gun"" turret to nuke silos and booster towers is available to you from the tower side and on the abilities you have simple damage abilities, slowing and stunning abilities and even an ability that permanently sacrifices the power you use to cast abilities in exchange for more resources to build towers.The abilities are a big part of the game and where other Tower Defense games like Defense Grid focus on building the most minimalistic defense possible Sol Survivor is all about intelligent tower placement and well timed ability use making it a very thoughtful and tactical game.Sol Survivor also comes packaged with some excellent multi-player modes which in my opinion is one of the most important things in a Tower Defense game. Unfortunately there aren't a whole lot of people playing this online anymore so unless you got friends to play with you might have a bit of a hard time finding opponents and coop partners.Probably the most intelligent Tower Defense game on steam and definitely one of the best.

												I didn't know what to expect from this game, but it's actually a solid tower defense.  It's pretty easy to get used to and they did a really good job at making effective tutorials to make sure you understand everything.  The difficulty curve was also well constructed.  It makes sure you know the basic concepts first and then gives you more to learn.  You can also unlock different officers who use different kinds of towers which can change how you play the levels.  If you're a fan of tower defenses, this is a pretty good one.			",2434,893,80,224,291,26,357

												Sol Survivor is a tower defense game with some interesting twists. The general gameplay is fairly standard - aliens walk down a path trying to steal your stuff, place towers to stop them, yadda yadda yadda... What makes this game unique are the various ""commanders"" from which you can select before starting a level. Each commander has their own set of turrets (which are placed once and work autonomously) and special abilities (powers that can be used actively by you during the match). This results in a huge variety of playstyles that are available, which encourages experimentation and replay (in order to find the best combination for certain maps, or whatever suits you best). The game has multiple difficulty levels as well as leaderboards, so if you are into competing with your friends for high scores, this is a good game for that. It also features a co-op mode, so you can play with a friend if you prefer working together (though I haven't tried that mode so can't speak to how it is). On the down side, the game is what I would call somewhat ""rough around the edges"". I mean, it's not bad or anything, just the presentation, interface and controls could be a bit better. But considering the fact that the game was built by a miniscule team of people, it's quite easy to forgive such minor inconveniences. All in all, this is a decent tower defense title with some unique aspects that is worth the asking price if you are a fan of the genre. B-			",828,379,20,113,78,6,151

												I was introduced to Sol Survivor by someone who'd read my review on Heretic and asked if I'd ever played it using the Doomsday engine.  He had an extra copy that he gifted me after we spent a couple hours kicking each other's asses in some Dukematches.This is my first ""real"" Tower-Defense game, and it's a great way to be introduced to the genre.  Before Sol Survivor, my only glimpse into this genre were the UMS ""Turret Defense"" and ""Pylon Defense"" user-created maps for Battle.net StarCraft matches (classic, mind you, not II).This is an old game by today's standards, but I would consider it and oldie-but-goodie.  However, the multiplayer pool is quite small, so only buy if you intend to play the single-player or have friends who want to play with you.  It's easy to get into, and the music is kick♥♥♥♥♥  The graphics are also quite contemporary, and I'm rather impressed that a tower-defense game has that much love put into it.  Story is somewhat nonexistent, but it's a moot point when you're watching your towers launch volley after volley of defensive flak to a kickin' soundtrack.  If you buy this game based on my review, feel free to look me up!  I'd love to enter a match with you.			",97,27,0,11,16,0,8

												A fun turret defence game with a lot of options.  It includes many maps and a variety of modes (both single and-player), and additional maps may be created.  I enjoy this game, but I have three main complaints:1. There are not many players hosting or looking to join servers.  However, there are a few.2. This game tends to crash right at the end of multiplayer rounds.  By that time, the game is over so it's not a big deal, but it should have been fixed.3.  In survival rounds, there comes a point where the game seems to just decide to kill you.  In Normal and Easy difficulty, this happens at just over an hour, while in Hard and Intense, it happes sooner.  At this point, enemies are sent which are simply too strong to be stopped.  They cruse right through, and you loose, even though you did everything right.Nonetheless, I still recomend this game.  It is certainly enjoyable.			",166,23,5,19,15,1,20

												One of the most unique takes on tower defense, the single player requires you to actually act on your feet as a commander and crush anything getting past your towers by hand, while the multiplayer is some of the most clever mode design you'll encounter (try balancing laying down/upgrading turrets, picking off anything that gets by, and MOUNTING THE ASSAULT ON OTHER PLAYERS WITH CREEPS all at once). Also, if you're like me and play everything windowed, this has one of the best windowed modes I've ever run across. That's like a +2 on my scale.It honestly pisses me off that this game doesn't get as much love as the bog-standard Defense Grid, which, admittedly,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.			",2447,961,90,309,287,27,386

												While i'm a huge fan of Defense Grid, i also like Sol Survivor a lot. It's also a tower defense game, but with less ""sterile"" maps to defend. They are a lot bigger than in Defense Grid and you have a lot more towers as well. I mean like tons of them. You also have several generals with different abilities and towers or you can even make a general of your own with towers of your selection. There are several missions and also many achievements to conquer. I seem to prefer the Survival mode the most. It's a simple, survive for as long as you can. It's just cool to watch those aliens suffer :)Graphics are pretty good, sound effects and music as well, aliens are very challenging and maps are also very interesting. It's just a properly good tower defense that you just have to own and play. Highly recommended!			",241,35,5,14,10,1,32

You can now even make your own maps with the map editor to extend the game's life spawn. Not to mention the value you get for so low price. The co-op survival mode is where this game shines. Lots of hours burned with different turret combinations on various maps.Sol Survivor is simply amazing and has probably the best price/enjoyment ratio out of my games. It's simple yet addicting.

												Great TD game. This game has a great tower selection system and simple and easy to understand. The game also has a large intresting amounts of mobs. The game has a great balancing system for players who like a challange and for players who want a kick back for a normal or easy time. One of the best features which you rarely see in a GOOD TD game is multiplayer with awesome VS. mode or just simple survival. The multiplayer also has leaderboards just like single player so you and your friends can team up and try to beat the boards. In conclusion Sol Survivor is an amazing TD game although I don't agree with the $10 price I think you should not let it change your mind I would highly reccomend this game if you enjoy TD games.

												A few days ago I was talking a friend and he had said that ""[Sol Survivor] is the pinnacle of tower defense games"" or something to that effect...and I have to agree with him. Most would say PvZ, Dungeon Defenders, or Defense Grid, but I really think if most people gave this game a shot they would see where I'm coming from. It's a seemingly simple game, that is more complex than meets the eye, there are many strategies to play around with and it's an amazing learning process, you master the game only through playing around with different builds. Even at 100+ hours I'm still coming up with tweaks to my best strategies, as well as coming up with new bizarre ones that somehow work. Although it's nearly 5 year olds it only shows it's age visually and remains the best true tower defense game I have ever played and I consider myself a tower defense junkie. The basics of this game is to place turrets around the paths of the enemies (which is already determined and easy to pick out on the map). Most turrets have pretty good range, so it's easy to make a good choke. Sounds simple, yet surprisingly there is a lot you can do. There is a fairly good variety of turrets and each of them specialize in something, making them all valuable in some way (or you can at least incorporate them all into some solid strategy). It takes time and playing around to really learn the ins and out of each turret. A lot of information is included in the in-game encyclopedia, but even that isn't completely exhaustive. On top of damaging turrets there are also a slew of support turrets that also mix up how you strategize placement and spending priorities. (note: money is gained in-game in different ways depending on what the income setting is set on) Another element of gameplay is the powers, your character has 100 max power. You can only choose so many powers and towers (I want to say about 8 each) every time you play a map, so that's another aspect you have to strategize. Regardless of you what you pick you'll be limited to casting your abilities based on how much power you have, it regenerates over time like mana would, so using your powers efficiently and at critical times is key.One argument could be made against my assertion that this is perhaps the best tower defense out there and that is it doesn't feature path building. That's to say you can't influence the path an enemy takes or build constructions, something that is key in games like Sanctum, Orcs Must Die!, and Defense Grid. Admittedly the ability to structure enemy pathing really adds to the strategizing process. At the same time, it can also make it easier (leading orcs to one solidified choke is key in OMD, and in DG the only way to get on the top 10 leaderboards is to bounce enemies back and forth blocking and unblocking sections of your structures), so it's arguable about what's better, I definitely like path building, but even so Sol Survivor still somehow captivates me more than games that allow for that.I think this is due in part to how relaxing and inviting this game is. There is never a time where I don't feel like playing this, that I'm not in the mood. The game is very laid back, the soundtrack is quite ambient, a lot of the levels are nighttime or snowy levels which means a lot of cool colours (grays and blues). The enemies move a nice constant rate, they aren't ferocious or in your face as they are in games like Sanctum or Orcs Must Die. As mentioned before you do have powers (abilities) but also mentioned before you can't spam them so even the ""combat"" aspect of the game is laid back. Overall it's a great game to kick back to, especially if you're with friends since you can spend most of the time chatting, both strategizing with each other and just talking about whatever strikes your fancy.This game has a good chunk of content, and playing survival in particular has yet to get old. I've played the campaign with friends quite a few times and still always enjoy replaying it. The difficulties are well balanced, you won't be mastering the hardest difficulty anytime soon, and since the survival mode is endless (and it gets exponentially harder) there is never a skill cap where you can essentially ""beat"" the survival mode. I don't feel like I've said enough about one of the games I love the most, but I'll wrap up by saying if you want a good tower defense game with focus on tower placement and a less active combat role then look into Sol Survivor, and if you're serious about trying it, find some friends you like playing and nag them to play with you, since friends really do make this game even greater than it already is (or ask me).

												some of the turrets are trap options (silos, railguns, tesla coils) or just way too expensive for what they do (silos, railguns, boosters, inhibitors), and there's not enough resources to go around most of the time unless you abuse Mass Scrap. So it's an improvement over defense grid in that regard, if only by a little.otherwise it's a neat tower defense. much better when played cooperatively or with PvP given the flexibility of resource splitting.10/10 would get angry over roaches again			",188,15,0,40,28,0,48

The ability to play the whole campaign and other modes in co-op, along with good options to control those co-op games (such as income distribution, etc.) - made it very good!  Played through the standard campaign on normal in a day with Seriok and had a great time.			",375,94,10,44,36,3,74

												A true thinking man's tower defense game.  Every enemy type is designed to counter a specific defense tactic.  For example, some enemies can regenerate health while not being attacked, making staggered towers difficult.  With a wide range of turret and support options (active support is a crucial component of this game, turrets alone won't do everything), Sol offers several tactical routes to accomplish your goals.

												One of the best Tower defence games, I've ever played. Much more crude than say Defence grid 1+2, but SO many options and tactics, based on the shere number of different turrets and support. Highly recommended in suvival mode, which imo is the most fun. Multiplayer does not work(unless you play with friends), since people usually are idiots, and play for themselves, which to me seems idiotic, when you sign up for a multiplayer match. But it is pretty much unbeaten in single player mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely hooked on this game.  One of the best in my collection.The gameplay is excellent, the soundtrack is amazing, the multiplayer adds more than plenty replay value, and the game is a quite solid production with lots of potential for enhancement later on.The only drawbacks I have with this game are the survival capping after the hour mark (eventually the mobs just start cheating and there's no way to survive after a certain point just after about an hour into the match but this isn't too bad of a thing, keeping games shorter than an hour and a half especially since in multiplayer there is no pause feature yet) and endgame, the brightness of the lighting can white-out the action.. also the grid is crucial for the game mechanics yet most of the time it is incredibly difficult to see.. instead of using bright green and red circles on a disappearing faint grid.. they could have made the grid a bit more visible.Overall though, excellent game, I very much enjoy it and recommend it.

Mechanics is easy to understand. Don't like games without active pause, but in this one that is not big problem except beginning of each mission when You have to quick review battlefield, choosing place to defend and start building first few turrets.

												Sol Survivor - simply one of the best Tower Defense games out there. Relatively free placeable turrets and a variety of weaponry and upgrades with a good amount of different enemies make Sol Survivor one of the cornerstones of nowadays TDs. The campaign isn't too hard to play. The different commanders make every single level a recurring challenge, it's fun to try every one of them. No matter if you're more into fire-it-up-gameplay or controlling the whole area with more defensive equipment, every commander has an own strategic plan to offer.The 3d graphics might appear a little old compared to younger games but is still what I would call bearable.Another highlight is the incredibly beautiful composed Soundtrack, which consists mostly of electronic space sounds and melodies which remind of late 80s synth pop.All in all a fantastic game!

												This is a classic tower defense game and while it's entertaining there are some better choices. That said, if you've played Orc's must die and finished up Sanctum. You might enjoy this one.It has several levels where you basically make towers and use abilities from the fleet to help supplement them. It can be a challenge but it's not impossible and there are plenty of achievements to be had. I really wish I could've given the multiplayer a try before writing this but unfortunately the game seems mostly dead as of 2014 in terms of an online following with the internet lobby being completely bare so buy this keeping in mind that it's only going to be a solo experience unless you grab a friend to buy it with you.All that said, there isn't too much that sets it apart from other tower defense games.  I enjoy it, but don't expect anything revolutionary.			",152,21,0,30,23,0,52

												A decent little indie Tower Defence title, this pretty much focuses on doing everything well rather than trying to break new ground.The basic campaign has you cast as a military officer on the ground, which sets up the interesting premise of selecting 'Executive Officers' - essentially a fancy way of selecting pre-set lists of turrets and support powers. Each one has a slightly different theme, some of which are orientated towards certain strategies and some towards certain 'flavours' - so one officer emphasises sheer pin-point damage while another emphasises... errr.... fire and heat.After completing the campaign (or rather, acquiring enough medals to unlock all the EXOs), you get a far better option in that you can choose which powers and towers from the full list, but you'd be surprised how hard it is is to put together an effective selection. Turrets and powers are interesting. You have your basic lasers, machine guns, missile pods etc etc that you'll likely have seen a million times before, plus a few interesting options like pillboxes (machine gun pods that divide their fire between all enemies in range) and various silos (extremely long range, powerful missile sites). Support powers are mainly satellite strikes which range from the obvious (laser beams, missiles, EMP strikes) to the weird (gas bombs, Fear effects, supply drops). There's even a nice encyclopedia to find out about them all.The only real issue I have with the game is that it looks a lot deeper than it is. The number of creeps that make up the waves looks amazing and you'd think you need evey bit of your tactical skill to handle the various monsters, cyborgs and robots arriving via ground and air... but in reality, all you have to do is build as many lasers and other air/ground-capable turrets on u-bends as you can and bombard everything you can. You can't alter their path so there's a limit to how much you can actually do on levels, and with the exception of a few levels, they're all basically the same - a few spawn sites, one or two bases for you to defend, and some hilly roads between. It isn't helped by taking place over fairly boring landscapes - you get a desert, lunar, snow and volcanic planets that are functionally identical beyond their colour.Overall it's worth the sale price I paid. Hardcore TD fans will likely power through it fairly quickly, but its fun while it lasts. It just isn't quite as polished or as deep as stuff like Sanctum 2 and Defence Grid: The Awakening.

												A well-rounded tower defense game. Good mix of tower placement vs. direct intervention to help fill in the gaps. Enemies are varied and have different weaknesses. Towers are varied and have different strategies. They also interact with other towers for more destruction. Multiplayer works well. I love the Shared Bounty mode so that you aren't permanantly sidelined if you suck. Easy enough to learn, but plenty of depth when you're ready for it. We pull this one out at most LAN parties.Edit: Just wanted to give a shout out that as of Nov 2015 my wife and I still pull this out now and again to try to push each level to at least one hour. Super fun and well balanced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was hoping for more with Sol Survivor. As it stands it's a little generic and lacking in style. I question some of the balancing, some towers just seem to dominate (ie. Laser, the tower that lets you cash in Energy for money works too well in some missions) while others not so much. Similar with the ""Actions"" available.The different ""commanders"" were the biggest let down, I was hoping for something along the lines of the classic Warcraft 3 ""Burbenog Tower Defense"" which requires co-operative play between completely distinct sets of towers.There's a lot to enjoy, and the multiplayer available here makes this game definitely worth a look.

The amount of customization in game modes, to turrets, to how money is distributed, this game can keep a goup entertained for a long time. And the addition of Survival mode was a good one, as it creates a neverending drive to do better. Take one friend, or take 3, it doesn't matter. The game will adjust to the amount of commanders there are so your game is always balanced for every situation. Good buy if you have friends, if you don't, go make some friends then buy a 4 pack.

												Probably one of my favorite indie game tower defenses. The games tower list and upgrades, along with its nice selection of game modes, including a good single player campaign, makes this a favorite among tower defenses for me. A good buy, but you might want to consider a 4 pack purchase, because like me, you'll probably want to play this with your friends.			",202,18,7,22,19,0,38

Man kann seinen eigenen Spielstil anpassen indem du selber auswählst welche Türme du mitnehmen willst. Es ist echt das Geld wert und bietet langen spielspaß mit oder ohne Freunde.

												I was hoping for more with Sol Survivor. As it stands it's a little generic and lacking in style. I question some of the balancing, some towers just seem to dominate (ie. Laser, the tower that lets you cash in Energy for money works too well in some missions) while others not so much. Similar with the ""Actions"" available.The different ""commanders"" were the biggest let down, I was hoping for something along the lines of the classic Warcraft 3 ""Burbenog Tower Defense"" which requires co-operative play between completely distinct sets of towers.There's a lot to enjoy, and the multiplayer available here makes this game definitely worth a look.

												This games single player campaign is very boring, even for a tower defense game. The game only truely shines in multiplayer, and in that aspect, it is amazing. The amount of customization in game modes, to turrets, to how money is distributed, this game can keep a goup entertained for a long time. And the addition of Survival mode was a good one, as it creates a neverending drive to do better. Take one friend, or take 3, it doesn't matter. The game will adjust to the amount of commanders there are so your game is always balanced for every situation. Good buy if you have friends, if you don't, go make some friends then buy a 4 pack.

												A solid tower defense game that just misses that mark that keeps you coming back.  It has lots of different towers (almost too many), and it has diffferent ""commanders"" you can choose who bring slightly different sets of towers into each level.  You also have abilities you can summon with a separate set of energy - things like poison clouds, nukes, etc, that let you do direct damage.  There are badges awarded for killing a certin enemy type a certain number of times, or building a certain tower a certain number of times.  These things def give it replayability.  The graphics are nothing special, and you can't make the waves come faster, so it can get slow at parts.  It's hard to explain, but while it had more cool things going for it than say Defense Grid, I didn't like it nearly as much.  Still a solid game though.			",733,177,23,71,37,7,90

												Sol Survivor, a very underrated or unknown game by most. Not much to it, honestly what you see is what you get, a tower defense game with a basic economy and powers that allows you to destroy hordes of invading aliens to save your people.A rather lengthy single player campaign is present but the true strength of this game lies in the coop survival feature. I have personally logged over 50 hours playing with friends and it never gets old. A wide variety of towers are availiable ranging from combat to support accompanied with a large selection of ""abilities"" used to help turn the tide of battle.If you enjoy tower defense games, you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot.

												The information in the co-op campaign says ""Join forces with up to four other players"". Four other player would result in a total of five players.This is incorrect, you can only be 4 players, not 5. If you try to join a fifth player that player gets a completely non-sensical error message that does not in any way inform you that you have reached the max number of players.Sloppy work. Still good.			",60,13,0,18,4,0,15

												I love Tower Defense games!But i couldn't bring myself to love this one.Even with it's awesome use of different Commanders with a specific mixup of abilities, all set in a sci-fi universe, i never caught on. In a moment of weakness i might say that the game had no soul, but i shan't.The towers and difficulty seemed strangely balanced. When i upgraded a tower i never felt it was worth it. I never got a sense of the math behind it, and that is important in a TD game. The enemies felt even more lifeless then normal TD enemies.So even with sci-fi, commanders, lots of towers and abilities and also high replayability, i was ultimately bored with an uninteresting game.What a shame.

												Sol Survivor is a well done game.  I enjoyed playing and played Coop with a friend.  It's challenging and fun to play as a team.  The types of defensive structures are varied and makes it fun to create combos for defense. My only complaint on the game and it isn't really a big deal is that it's pretty impossible to go past 1 hour and 30 minutes on a mission.  Maybe it's different on single player.  The good part of that is that if you don't want to be playing all night you know you won't be. Wait for this to go on sale and pick it up!			",113,26,1,32,16,1,44

												One of the best tower defense games ive played...definitley in the top 5. Also for the people saying this is a copy of defense grid, I did not see this. I disliked defense grid and this game was great. Totally worth the money. Wish it had more levels in the campaign..9/10!			",173,55,0,68,46,1,89

Captains Log, 06.12.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Sol Survivor. Apparently this is one of the Tower Defense Games that you might have overlooked. And it really does not look like it is worth a second look. But it is! So let´s have a closer look! First look at the game: also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]Sol Survivor offers everything a Tower Defense game should offer; it also offers a bit extra and does not deliver on the looks and sounds. Here is what you get:You control the building of defensive towers and the use of tactical skills or activated abilities like air strikes, EMP blasts etc.The Towers you are able to build depend on the officer that you chose for a mission. Each officer has a unique mix of towers and skills at his or her disposal. The tower placement happens on a grid based mesh that is restricted in some areas. Tower placement needs thinking and thinking ahead. Although the selling of tower is possible it is also less efficient from a resource perspective.Speaking about resources: You manage your available energy for active skills and your available resources to build towers. Energy regenerates over time and resources are collected from defeated enemies. (With the need to collect them by hovering or clicking with the mouse like in some other games.)What else makes it worth a second look? Features! Single Player Campaign and Survival Mode, Co-Op Survival mode with up to 4 Players (Online and LAN), Campaign mode Co-op for 2 players (one builds the turrets the other controls support skills), Co-op Campaign with up to 4 players (each player builds and has support skills), Wave based Survival with shared lives (up to 6 players) and a Versus mode where the last player standing wins (up to 8 players) – There may not be many Players around in Online Multiplayer anymore so bring your friends! One thing that set Sol Survivor apart from other games in this genre is the fact that you don’t get a preview of the upcoming waves of enemies and their composition. This forces you to adapt quickly and according to your current skillset and tower setup. I enjoyed this very much and found it to be more refreshing than getting a heads up before every upcoming wave.Look and feel and sound: Like I hinted in the introduction the game does not look very fancy. It also lacks some satisfying booms and `splosions and laz0rs soundeffects. If that turns you off, move on. If not: Please consider looking at the game past the tutorial. It really has the ability to drag you in. You can for example set up the camera at every angle and distance you like. That is pure freedom that other games do not offer and also very enjoyable and convenient in a tower defense game. Word of advice on one feature that is missing: Speeding up the game is not possible. If you are not patient this may trigger a nervous breakdown. On the other hand it includes a color blind mode. That is awesome! Captains Orders:If you have played all of those tower defense games in a shiny suit you may need a fresh perspective. Sol Survivor does offer that, but it is delivering on the core mechanics that makes this genre enjoyable. A solid and somewhat indie / underdog game that deserves your attention if you enjoy Tower Defense as a genre.Verdict: Cargo! Sol Survivor offers a good alternative to other tower defense games. It is also one of the few Tower Defense games with a satisfying Co-op mode. Will play more!

												This is a pretty good TD, one of the better ones that I've been able to find. Even so, it's still not perfect by any means. The game frequently crashes. The developer of the game is no longer in business, so don't expect any support. The multiplayer and survival modes are kinda limited in the sense that after around an hour and fifteen minutes, you're screwed, no matter how many towers you have in place and no matter how much you spam abilities. Also, multiplayer is totally dead... you have to add people who own the game and organize matches outisde of the game itself because you aren't likely to ever see a randomly hosted game. Last but not least, some towers are clearly better than others, so once you figure out what works best, there's hardly any point in going with something different. On the up side, it's pretty satisfying to play and there's loads of fun custom maps out there. It's worth ten bucks for sure, but I wish that the game would get updated.			",139,46,11,27,17,1,46

												I am a fan of tower defence games and i enjoy what Sol Survivor brings to the table. The terrain is three dimensional and organic looking (a bit unusual for this genre), and i like the sense of scale in this game.So why do i not recommend it? The game doesn't work. For the last couple of years I, and many others, are unable to launch the game for some unknown reason. If you look at the forum discussions around this game you can see some people manage to get it running, and others not. I suspect that this will unfortunately not be fixed since it seems that the developer has dropped support for this game.I did like this game and would play it some more if it worked.
