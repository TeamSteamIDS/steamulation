												This expansion is not a representative of what King Arthur: The Roleplaying Wargame 1 or 2 is like. The only thing that is accurately represented would be the choose-your-own-adventure style visual novel which are pretty spot on. with the choices you make directly influencing the units you will have in the battle at end. The consequences of your actions are not always clear either. forcing you at times to carefully think about your decision lest you wish to redo the ""novel"" chapter to get the ideal end.The battles themselves play more like an Age of Empires campaign level in the sense that you progress. sometimes linearly. through a battle to complete objectives such as defending for 20 minutes or gathering forces from different parts of the battlefield to attack an enemy. The campaign map has no free-roaming and is simply select one of the three champions' storylines and begin the next mission.All in all, only get this if, like me, you love the series and are interested in what happened between King Arthur 1 and 2 (the story doesn't have anything at all to do with the legends of King Arthur, so if buy this solely because you love the King Arthur legends then this won't serve you any purpose.)For five bucks (USD 5) the game is to me a 7/10. nearly an hour of entertainement for each dollar!

												If you liked the original King Arthur, you'll probably like this.If you didn't, there still may be some differences you may enjoy.Fallen Champions is a linear expansion to the original King Arhur in which you take control of 3 different heroes and their armies and follow their stories in what is essentially a story-based prequel to the events of King Arthur 2. This game uses the exact same engine as the original game and the combat and CYOA book sections play out the exact same, albeit the combat had some improvements. It is much less of a full game than its predecessor, because it is not a game. This is a stand-alone EXPANSION to the original King Arthur. So it is missing many features from the original game such as kingdom management, but this is intentional as the entire point of this expansion is to be a plot-filler between both King Arthur Games.If you enjoyed the open world and kingdom management features of King Arthur the most, you may want to skip this. If you don't mind linearity and would like to see the before-events of King Arthur 2, definitely pick this up.			",180,24,2,40,36,1,42

												NO save feature during a scenario, and the scenarios aren't short.  Bad combination.  Gameplay not that interesting,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sadly what could have been so much more remains to be a badly executed Total War ripoff.			",529,261,7,96,60,4,154

												Pretty disappointing attempt at a traditional RPG using the King Arthur: the Roleplaying Wargame as a source.  The original game and all its expansions are fantastic, but this standalone has such terrible gameplay that it's essentially unplayable.  Don't buy it unless you're getting it automatically as part of a King Arthur bundle--in which case, play all of the others and don't even install this one.			",132,99,0,41,12,2,23

												I highly recommend the whole King Arthur series. beautiful game engine and some nice rpg elements to the deep story driven campaigns. Not saying this game is perfect, it has some flaws, but the good out weighs the bad by a long shot.3.5/5  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
