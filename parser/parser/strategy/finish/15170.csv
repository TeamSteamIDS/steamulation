												When it came out, I bought the original CD. 2006 I was a kid and I just played it for fun.4 years later I played it and from then on it became my favourite game ever! I finished all the campaigns!8 years later I bought it for steam and will play it again just because this game deserves it!8/10 for Graphics (for a game that came out in 2006 it's badass)8/10 for Gameplay (turn based game in this game is fine)9/10 for Story (best fantasy story game I ever played)10/10 for music and soundtracks (I think this is the best part of this game)If you want to start to playing Might and Magic, I recommend starting with V!Here on V you have more factions to play, and the play style is different on each one. The first missions are too simple and you can't enjoy that much playing with Heaven (people, knights and angels) but when you start playing with necromancy (spoiler alert) you will be able to play with Heaven too.I like this game because it's somewhat difficult... You need to calculate your moves, take troops in all your cities and strike enemy only if they don't have reinforcements... And most of the times you need run away from the enemy just because they have thousands of troops and you have few peasants.The final battle of the final mission gives you something different... (spoiler) You will be able to play a battle with 5 heroes.The expansions like Tribes of the East and Hammers of Fate are awesome too but the original MMH5 is better...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Heroes of Might and Magic V is a turn based strategy game in a long series which started back in 1995 with Heroes of Might and Magic: A Strategic Quest and has been an extremely popular and successful strategy game for many years with the 6th game in the series coming out in October of 2011. As mentioned, HoMM V is a turn based strategy game where you control one hero for each army. The hero has 8 slots for 8 different units but they can have as many units as they would like under their command with that unique unit. The different units include classes such as archers, soldiers, cavalry, archangels and devils, ghosts, ghouls and many more. When your hero travels along the map they can pick up different relics and items that can increase attack, defense, luck, moral and other abilities and items that will help in a battle. They hero can only travel so far per day and after they are done they pass their turn on to the other opposing player whether that be AI or Human. 	During their turn they can fight any enemies within their range which in turn starts a battle with a grid like system. These battles are also turn based and are based on the units speed not necessarily strict turn order. If an archer gets a lucky shot in they can get a boost and moral and actually go again either right after or sometime before their original turn order. Some units are faster than others; for example, griffins can go twice before the peasants even go once. 	During the game the player can also take over cities, towns and keeps. The main city can be upgradable which allows you to build different units and upgrade others. Along with that the player can also higher other mercenary heroes that can have their own armies and travel around under the player’s control. Towns and keeps have certain units tied to them that each week replenish and can be bought by the heroes to add to their armies. In order to upgrade/build buildings and buy these units the player must capture strategic resources all along the map that include wood, ore, gems, mercury, sulfur, crystal and gold.   	The story is a pretty simple one and spans across 6 different campaigns (the expansions add 2 more) which include Haven, Inferno, Necropolis, Dungeon, Sylvan and Academy. I only got through the first campaign as the game is very long but in this one Isabel the Queen is about to get married to King Nicolai when the demon invasion causes them to get separated and she is working towards getting back with the King while killing as many demons on the way as she can. She eventually finds him dying from some demonic spell that Agrael, a demon, attacks him with and is determined to get revenge against all demons and after which the dying king declares her ruler of the Holy Griffin Empire when he dies. 	The graphics of the game are fairly basic and even for their time they weren’t anything special. In 2006 when we saw this game launch we saw other RTS and TBS games such as Empire at War, Company of Heroes and Warhammer 40k. So even if I was judging this by today’s standards it didn’t really even live up to the standards of 2006 when the game launched. Though there isn’t anything really wrong with the graphics, they just feel dated and not as impressive as other games of the time. There was one thing that kept bugging me about the game and that would be the camera. You couldn’t click on different items in the world without moving it around or if there was a fog of war it forced the unit to go all the way around or wouldn’t allow the unit to go forward at all.	The Sound was also equally bland and the music was very repetitive. The music didn’t so much get in the way or be annoying it just didn’t change very much. The voice acting wasn’t anything special but it wasn’t awful either. However the sound effects were unique for each unit so there is that. The biggest thing for me however was the setting the game was in. There are so many different areas and creatures in the game that it made for a very interesting adventure through the first campaign just getting to know this world. 	Overall I can’t really compare this to any other game in the series as I haven’t played them however I have really enjoyed the gameplay of the game so much that it made me want to buy the 6th game in the series since I know the graphics have been vastly improved and look very impressive. I am giving the game a little boost in rating due to the limits of technology at the time however my 5 tiers are what the game rates to today’s standards.•	Story  - 2 out of 5•	Gameplay – 5 out of 5•	Graphics – 2.5 out of 5•	Sound  - 2 out of 5•	Fun – 5 out of 5Pros: -	Great Turn based gameplay-	Can be Hard and rewarding-	A nice learning curve-	Interesting world and loreCons:-	Music/Sound are ok, nothing thrilling-	Story is ok however the world is great-	Irritating CameraI’m giving a Total score of 74% ",713,127,11,115,87,11,120

												Have you ever read reviews stating a game is so good, that the reviewer just needs one more turn?This game is such a game more than most games, imo.So, many years ago when I was a teenager, I played Heroes of Might & Magic 3 and 4 alongside other few top classics, such as the Age of Empires games.Therefore, I decided to buy the fifth installment in this game series in the Steam summer sale,as I never got to play it.And, I didn't regret it. The game has the same old feel to it, as the other older games in the series.You can tell by the graphics, that this game is from 2006, but it doesn't matter.Gameplay is awesome! The graphics are neat and the music is making the game immersive.The exploration, combat system and fantasy setting is better than most.The gameplay is deep, but you can jump right into the game, and try it out, untill you get it, without getting frustrated or confused about the gameplay. Here I am in the middle of the night, wanting just to play half an hour before going to bed,but almost three and an half hour has surpassed/flown away, and I had to close the game, because I really need sleep.9,5/10 for epic classic turn-based strategy.One of the best on the market, if you like these types of games.

												Pretty darn good stuff.Purists (much like Resident Evil purists) will say that it sucks balls, that it doesn't even touch the shining paragon that is HoMM 3, that it should never have seen the light of day, blah blah blah♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's as good, even maybe slightly better than HoMM 3. With expansions mind you.All the races end up being really balanced (with the expansions lol) while still having a VAST array of differing unit, hero and ability choices. That alone is quite a feat.But on top of that is a killer art style, a fabulously rendered world map, and an updated (for the better, morale was way way overpowered in HoMM3) combat system			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay first off, for all those who want this game but read the system requirements and thought ""Oh drat, I cannot play this on my system, I have a windows 8 and it says up to XP only"". I have GREAT news for you-I have this game, on a cheap 350 dollar notebook from walmart. It has a windows 8 OS. This game-runs PERFECTLY on it. I did not even need to change or alter any compatibility settings or mess with the graphics or audio configuration. On default layout, no changes at all-it runs perfectly. Now, obviously, I cannot guarantee this will be true for absolutely everyone. I can however say given how cheap my own computer system is-I think this game would work for almost everyone running a windows 8 system. Probably also the same with windows 7 but I cannot say for certain on that one. Now onto the game itself. Heroes of Might and Magic series is a well known and well loved series for a number of good reasons. First of all, there are different races, all with their unique units and hero specializations. This particular Heroes of Might and Magic is I feel the best of the series so far (Yes, better even that Might and Magic Heroes VI.) The graphics are fine if not great, but the game itself is what makes this game so much fun. With both single player, multiplayer, and even hot seat player capability you can play with friends far or near, or solo. It has campaigns for each race, all of which combine into one epic story on love, loss, and each faction.race fighting to survive and rule over all.  Combat is laid out on a open fiend or fighting to defend or gain control of a castle/keep with wall fortifications between you and the enemy. You have control over all of your units and can even through leveling you hero, gain control over the war machines in your unit such as the first aid tent, the ballista, and the catapult, allowing you to heal the units of your choice or aim the ballista at a particular target, or have the catapult try and take out only the door or remove the turret towers aimed at you as a example. The units themselves can have special abilities. For example, the demon units can use a skill called gating, to summon up more of their own kind to join you for the battle (These gated units are temporary and vanish after each battle). The Undead units with the help of their hero can rise again after death, and if you defeat living targets, can even spend dark energy points to raise them again as undead units in your army (the type of unit they turn into depends on how powerful they were before). The list goes on. Outside of the campaigns which are fun and throw new challenges at you to keep the game fresh and fun (and also tie into the storyline perfectly), such as having to avoid a enemy or outrun them to a safe zone to meet up with a particular hero or town. Other times you have one week to take over a town and set up camp before having to wipe out the enemy that stands in your way and so on. The game play itself has a little learning curve, to understand what different objects on the map do for you, and figuring out how best to defeat units or how to control your own to the best advanatage-but the learning curve is built into the storyline so you are not derailed by some overtly lengthly tutorial. You simply learn as you progress and by the mid-part of the very first campaign, you'll be a expert hand at building up your keep, controlling your units, and understanding how to level your hero to your advanatage (Though more time playing with all the races will be needed to fully see what is the best way to level a particular hero).  Each hero has it's own unique talent as well. There is a elven hero who has a powerful ranged strike and boosts the damage of all it's groups hunter (archer) units. There is a demon hero whose spedciality is making each ballista shot explosive, doing extra damage each time the ballista's turn comes around. There is a Magic Hero who specializes with the smallest of units, the gremlins, who jhave a ranged blunderbuss shot attack that means a huge army of many small minions with a combined strength enough to take down far more powerful units of lesser numbers. The list again goes on. So it is in your interest to read up when you build your tavern, where you recruit new heroes, to see what each hero does and choose the one whose specialization you need most-someone who can race over the landscape and explore it our simply outrun the enemy, someone who brings extra firepower, or someone more specialized for a particular foe or to best defend your keep while you take your main hero out into the fray. The game is, in fact-complete in every sense as is, but if you finish the campaigns and want more-good news again! There are two expansion campaign games for this game (look at the DLC for the game or buy the whole collection at once for $19.99 USD). Each one adds a new race and continues the storyline. First, the dwarven race and then the orcs-also calle dht eribes of the East.) I highly recommend both expansions as the races are fun, enjoyable, and and a completely fresh set of skills and tech and units to the game. The orcs are particularly amusing, as you can have cyclops through goblin in a kamikaze fashion into the face of enemy units. It only costs one mere goblin, the cheapest of units, to do a massive damage spray with the help of your powerful cyclops' throwing arm. If you love having complete control over a army, a castle, and a hero-if you enjoy besieging castles and trampling the enemy under hoof and claw, if you have ever enjoy any turn based, fantasy game with a bit of storyline-then this game is for you. You will NOT be dissapointed by it.For this game by itself without the DLC, it costs a mere $9.99 and offers many hours of gameplay and has endless replayability with the multiplayer mode (Which you can play solo as well against as few as one or up to 8 AI competitors).  So really, there is no reason to NOT buy this game unless you truly despise everything turn based.Even then, this game may well change your mind or at least make you willing to put up with the turn based combat for the sheer fun of everything else about the game.

												Peak point of the franchise, a worthy successor the nostalgia of Heroes II and III. The classic gameplay and the incredibly well designed 3D cities, combat finally got mixed together the right way, every way. While the graphics certainly look aged at this point and you have to get a widescreen mod for it too (takes like 5 seconds of googling), writing this in 2016 I can say the game is old enough now to have a nostalgia wave when you think about it, and the graphics certainly support the good looking and well designed desired quality measure, while looking just old enough for your fantasy to fill the rest.The singleplayer campign is while full of tiresome and cringeworthy dialogue, has interesting characters and character development (!), if you stick around for a few missions to let it unfold. The skirmish battles are needless to say, what keep this game ageless. Too bad multiplayer got shut down, because even if I didn't play it once, the extra mode that was a single combat with selectable premade heroes and armies was great. Local co-op of course still exists, if you can get people sitting next to you in front of your PC for like 2 days... oh man I miss the '00s.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Heros of Might & Magic V is a classic game of epic strategy. This game combines turn-based, army-oriented combat with RPG-like logistics to grow the various forces. Instead of clicking on a building to query up troops, you must either send out your general out to rally them, or recruit them from you town. It's a refresting, and unique take, on the stregy genre of games. The graphics of this game havn't aged very well, as with most games published around the same time as this one. Also, it's art style is pretty much a rip-off of the Warhammer Fantasy tabletop game. But that is basically what this game is: ""Warhammer: the Campign"". And thats not a bad thing. If the idea of a semi-casual, low-APM, army campign game sounds even mildly interesting, then you'll love this game. Just, try not to look the in-game characters in they eyes during dialoge. The uncanny valley is strong here, after all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Heroes of M & M 5 is a good game, a bit dated but a solid Fantasy Turn Based Strategy with RPG elements.TBS is a niche genre and sometimes intimidating, but Heroes has simple and easy gameplay, you control heroes who must explore the scenarios in search of goals and has troops to assist you in combat. Just like on the scenario map, combat is turn based and also easy to understand as well as the towns managing. The AI is good and challenging, tricky sometimes. Is graphically outdated but perfectly playable, the weak point is the animation of campaign cut-scenes, badly made.The overall campaign is ridiculously large, there are 6 factions and each has a campaign with 5 phases with a storyline that connects them, the plot has no big deal and the feeling that remains is that the campaign was made to play and better understand each faction in case of playing in skirmish mode.Being long the campaign becomes tiresome and the heroes skill system is a bit complicated to understand. I had performance issues and the game only opened when installed in the same directory with Steam. I recommend this game for those who enjoy strategy, fantasy, and looking for something different then RTS or with a slower pace.7/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												Heroes V brings all Heroes fans back to their origins as the game builds on all of the series' past experiences to make a truly epic game. Days of campaigning is involved in beating Heroes V, and RTS fans will most definitely feel that their money has been well invested.Heroes V is a presentation marvel. The game boasts some fantastic bright, colourful 3D graphics that bring the experience alive. It’s brilliant to see some of the old regular structures from previous Heroes games and recreated in 3D.I am truly spellbound by the splendor of this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Heroes of Might & Magic series is probably the one, apart from The Elder Scrolls, that has devoured the most of my time.It started with HoMM3, that I was introduced to by my friends in 5th or 6th grade, and I ordered it soon after that.After playing HoMM3 for so many hours, I thought HoMM4 would be as good, but was deeply dissapointed when almost EVERYTHING was changed, from the town-system to hero-mechanics. Therefore, my hopes for HoMM5 were somewhat lower than what should have been appropriate, because HoMM5 brought back what HoMM3 was, in 3D graphics!I have loved almost every hour spent on this title (it far exceeds the ""105 hours"" listed on steam, I had the game on CD years before even joining steam), and this one is a strong ""Must buy""-title!If you like tactical turn-based strategy set in a rich fantasy world with many different factions to choose from, this is the game for you! (If you want to go a bit more retro I would also recommende HoMM3, of course ;) )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fun and interesting game to play with friends and you can even play online or in hotseat.Unfortunately there is an even better version with more units.races,spells,events and maps called ""heroes of might and magic five:tribes of the east"".So I actually recommend getting that instead of this,still if you want to complete your set or just want to see the campaign of this game(which is really fun)go ahead and buy it.The gameplay and graphics are great.

												Heroes of Might and Magic V is yet another attempt to revitalize the franchise. A new developer with a new vision, only the developer has no vision. This installment is in many ways just a recreation of Heroes III with a few features and some new technology. Unfortunately simply recreating an old game isn't enough to warrant a new purchase and the new features introduced does not quite meet the standard you would expect from a big name franchise like this.Although the basic gameplay is still great there simply isn't enough new in the game to really consider it a continuation of the franchise. New features, like spell-less heroes getting a free attack and an initiative list that lets you see in what order units are going to get their turn, are nice additions to the core formula but they don't really add anything new to the game overall when not combined with more extensive overhauls and improvements.One of the more significant additions to the game is the new racial abilities that helps distinguish between the heroes, separating them into more sub groups than the usual Melee vs Magic that previous games in the series used. Unfortunately, as with all such systems, without proper balance it adds very little and this was not properly balanced which makes much of what the system tries to do an exercise in futility. Once you realize which abilities are strong and which are weak you will pretty much only have one or two hero builds that are worth following, regardless of what racial abilities are available to you.The second and without a doubt the biggest change to the game is the move to full 3D. The game sure looks pretty but a number of bugs, jerky camera movements and items on the map being obscured by the wrong camera angle detracts much from what should have been a major graphical improvement.The multi-player is heavily marred by bugs and crash. In particular the out of sync issues makes it near impossible to finish a game online.Heroes of Might and Magic IV is not a very notable step in any direction, it seems like the developers was so scared of doing any wrong that they ended up doing almost nothing at all which leaves us with what is just a prettied up Heroes III with a few new issues that need fixing.Like Heroes III it is still an enjoyable game however because of many lacks and faults in the game you can't help but feel it is a step backwards for the franchise.

												The best HoMM game in the series IMO. I grew up playing HoMM 2 and got a physical copy of this game as soon as it came out. I've put hundreds of hours into it and still enjoy it to this day. After 5 the series takes a nose dive in the wrong direction - seriously, Ubisoft what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing to this series? I have the sixth game and it's 'playable' but won't be buying the 7th which is out now and looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ I hope the future of the franchise isn't beyond saving already - just revamp the old games with modern graphics and animations and my wallet is yours to violate how ever you please.

												Coming from HoMM 2 and 3 I must say I was surprised with this one.I was quite well surprised because before I played V, I first played IV (4th) and that one just lacked everything for a HoMM game.This one feels like it went more back to it's roots and the classical HoMM formula which makes it such a great game. The visuals are pleasing, the minions and leaders are also quite well made and it still has that ""Just one more turn and I'll go to bed"" in 4 in the morning to it.Can't say I got that into the story of the game but then again I never have played the HoMM series for the story.If you liked HoMM 2 & 3 I find it hard NOT to enjoy this gorgeous piece of Might and Magic.

												Excellent game! Played most of the Heroes games over the years, but this one is one of the best, if only because the missions in the campaign are much more varied than in previous games. The graphics are good, the gameplay is excellent and very compelling. Also, it's challenging without becoming stupidly difficult like HOMM 3 tends to do. If you enjoy turn-based strategy I can really recommend this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A must have for anyone who enjoys strategy RPGs This whole series is required reading in my classroom. It has it's flaws, as any older game would, like how some missions can drag on, due to some monsters being scripted to fight you, regardless of how overwhelming your advantage is, but if you can get over that, you'll find days and days and days of enjoyment in the campaigns. Slightly improved Ui over the previous installments, and a fun new ultimate skill unique to each clast (though they did balance that a little poorly, since by time you have the required levels and skills to get your ultimate, the campaign will be mostly over, if you can get it at all). I woukd also strongly suggest getting both the DLCs for this, as they both include new campaigns that are just as long as the main game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a long time veteran of HMM, I can say this game is solid. The story is not as good as some before, but still OK. Somehow it feels a little less complex. On the other hand, the animations look nice enough and the maps are cool. The campaign is long and will take ya plenty hours to complete. Only a few missions are really hard in normal setting. No bugs. Nice music. Different camera views. Little heroes just doing their might and magic as they should and that's always a classic cool gaming experience.			",47,23,0,21,5,0,31

												A superb entry in the Heroes franchis, Heroes V is exactly what you expect as a heroes fan.  If you've never played Heroes before, I's like to recommend this title to you as an excellent intro to turn-based strategy gaming.You basically run an empire, determined by the scenario setup, of a few towns, and can recruit army leaders (""heroes"") to lead your forces to victory.  The heroes level up, RPG-style, as they win combat encounters and explore the map, and the towns develop in a similar fashion, as you invest in them -- producing larger, more interesting armies as they get better.Heroes is very much a strategic title, rather than a tactical one -- its true that bad tactics can lose you a battle very easily, but good tactics can't really best a vastly superior force, because the AI simply never plays in a manner to would allow you to overrun it, in a such a manner.  You win the battle before it starts, as it were. If you're into strategy, and high fantasy, this is a game for your library, plain and simple.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 I did manage to find an even BETTER deal, outside Steam; speccifically being a copy of it, with it's expansions included.---- When I first played this game, I was dissapointed due to the fact that, when it came to some custom standalone scenarios, I couldn't choose a faction type, to play as. But then again, at least this game is definitely not terrible, and overall, doesn't quite have the glitches, that ""Might & Magic: Heroes VI"" does. What makes it convincing is, this game combines the genres of turn-based strategy games with minor town development involved, (so in other words, games like Sega's ""Total War"" franchise, only with being fantasy-based) with tactical-rpg elements. Only thing is, only your leaders are able to level up, and NOT the recruited army members; they're simply being LED, by your leaders, that you get to play as. There are two types; ""might"", which focus more on strength, and ""magic"", which focuses more on spells that can be cast, to fight against your foes, but still being a bit more tricky, in some cases.---- In other opinions, This game is quite interesting; as an in-depth strategy game, I first remember playing the original ""Heroes of Might & Magic"", as a used computer game bought from a thrift store, and I did play it, back when I was a younger child. It was pretty good, and overall, I LOVED IT; it definitely had some depth into strategy-based gameplay, even for it's time. While the game definitely is not the greatest game on Steam, it's definitely a gem that not everyone knows about. I never cared for games outside the ""Heroes"" series, within the ""Might & Magic"" franchise.			",64,17,0,13,2,0,9

												This is (for the most part) a proper successor to Heroes 3, which is generally thought of as THE best title in the HoMM series.  I still prefer 3, but 5 is in many ways a recasting of Heroes 3 in a prettier skin.  Mechanics remain largely the same, although I felt like the bigger maps were still a bit small.  Enemy AI cheats too much, so it might be worth seeking out third party mods to see if anyone was ever able to address that.  Regardless, this is a good buy if you can get everything on sale.

												Why has nobody ever told me about these games?! I just bought the M&M bundle a couple days ago and started with this game. I'd only every played Dark Messiah, and that was not at all what I expected (see my review). I thought Heroes was going to be similar to Warlords: Battlecry or Warcraft. I couldn't have been more wrong.The only thing this game has in common with Warcraft is the fantasy setting Warcraft is an RTS; M&M is a turn-based wargame with RPG elements. You start the game with one hero, who has a small army attached to her (like twenty troops or something). You run your hero around the map, picking stuff up and claiming buildings for your team. When you get into a battle, you get whisked away to a battle board where you play out a strategic turn-based battle.The controls are so intuitive that there are times I can't figure something out. Them I DO figure it out and I'm like ""oh. I didn't think it could be that simple.""I can't wait to play M&M 6, and I can't wait to play the two expansion packs for this game.My advice: remove your head for a few hours and play this game. It's very easy to play, and there is a decent tutorial.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game if you can overlook some of the dated elements, such as the graphics and art direction, and lack of combat balance resulting in a lot of hair pulling on your part. The difficulty spikes are very obvious and off-putting for some people, which I fully understand. If you are a fan of min-maxing gameplay and thinking out your moves several turns ahead, this game can seriously fill that niche. Basically though; HOMM V isn't for everybody, not by a long shot. It's also not a particularly good introduction to the series, for that I would advise HOMM III or VI. So why the positive recommendation? Because of the highly rewarding experience HOMM V provides, as well as the overall feeling of authenticity that simply oozes out of the game. Few games make me feel so good for winning a particularly difficult scenario, especially with some of the worse classes/heroes. I would advise not skipping out on HOMM V if you are playing through the series, no matter what long-time fans say.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oldschool game. If you haven't played it when you were 8-13 years old, you will think this one is not worth the money. I love it because I have played this game soooo long ago and it brings me good memories and nostalgic feeling about it. All enviromoment reminds me of GOT or LOTR (In my perspective). V one is awesome because battles is a lot more improved than before in IV or III one. Also all of your army charackters has three levels not two (if you have bought gold edition) which is really cool. I would give it a strong 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful graphics, excellent story line, great game play. If you like Turn based games I highly recommend this one. I do with there were better skill trees as it is a bit confusing at first especially trying to figure out what skills are worth getting and what they lead to. But I am only a few hours in. Also I wish the UI size could be changed. It is HUGE and rather ugly compared to the beauty of the game. LOVE LOVE LOVE the 3D moveable camera. I wish they had kept that in all their  later games but alas for some reason they did not... perhaps in HOMM 7.  Get this game, You will not regret it and it is a heck of a deal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buggy UI and AI.My biggest gripe is the AI. It used to be fine, but now that my hero learned Deflect Missile (and taught it to all my other heroes), that's all they cast in battle. I will be battling against casters or just foot soldiers, and if left to his/her own, my heroes will just start uselessly defending against missiles!UI is super buggy. Clicking is a little off on buttons but the worst is using sliders. For instance, using the marketplace to exchange resources REQUIRES using the slider. Most of the time the slider doesn't work. Sometimes as you grab and wiggle around it will jump the bar somewhere around where you wanted it. It is impossible to get it exactly where you want it, so after 20-30 seconds of trying to slide, you will choose a value that is ""close enough"". Same thing when you split your armies, the slider is terrible so it's easier to split army in half (default position of slider), do transfer, then continue splitting the result in half until you get the exact amount you wanted.This is definitely a keyboard-only game. Most of the screentips show you which buttons to press, but there are still many that you can only figure out by trial/error. For instance, there is no way to split armies without using the keyboard, and there's no tooltip letting you know to hold shift and drag the army.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After quite a bit of of relatively fun play, I had to spend hours repeat level 6 multiple times, and I couldn't get past it even on easy difficulty.  I kept getting stuck and killed.  That was after having spent a couple hours on level 5 trying to figure out some extremely vague quests about finding something and meeting someone, but with little clue as to who, how, or where, and so eventually I had to look it up in a walkthrough.For me, generally I play games to get away from the frustration in my life, not add to it.  That's why I decided it wasn't worth headache to continue playing.  Unfortunately I guess that means it will be impossible for me to experience the rest of the game.I can never understand why some people seem to enjoy games that require hours of repetition and failure.  In my opinion, the easy setting should be for people who don't like that sort of frustration.In summary: frustrated and dissapointed are not emotions that I want to experience when I'm playing a game.

												Summary: If you're a fan of the genre, it's the same formulaic gameplay you expect from a turn-based fantasy game. It gets amazingly repetitive halfway into the game, there is a fair amount of challenge to push you along the way but the game has its' bugs and the difficulty spikes unrealistically at times. The lore and storyline is there to string a series of missions together, the characters for the most part unremarkable and limited development put forth. I rate the game as a 3/5, purchase if you already know what you're getting into or if it's heavily discounted for the unitiated.I've been playing the HOMM series since it first came out on my father's i386, playing custom maps and amassing a ridiculous stack of creatures to steamroll through the enemy. The game was addicting because there was nothing like it for its' time and to have limitless power and to just build the most amazing kingdom you wanted held its' charm on me. This and Civilization were the PC games that I remembered burning hundreds of hours playing as a child and so I have a certain nostalgic leaning towards them. For those that have never played the series, it's a hex turn-based strategy role-playing game. It is a strategy game from the perspective of the combat involved, the resource collection and kingdom management, and the numerical emphasis of armies. At the same time a role-playing game from the hero creation and customization, to the fantasy lore and storyline, and the implementation of spellcraft and quests. Resources and territories will be contested by players and those that can manage both kingdom and hero well will be favored to win.Now to speed forward to the fifth installment, at its' core HOMM follows the same formula from previous games. But to me, take away the updated graphics and audio enhancements, and you're left with a game that is remarkably similar to the very first HOMM. This can be great for enthusiasts, but you would expect for a fifth entry the formula could be improved, a more compelling method of storytelling created, just a greater way of being both a strategy and role-playing game at the same time. The storyline is weak, the cutscenes really don't add depth or character development, at the end of the game I felt that I was just controlling 5 very bland heroes on a rather generic mission to save the world from another trite demonic nemesis. We could probably comment and say, ""well the cutscenes were done with in-game graphics, which didn't detract from the presentation."" But I would say, watching every character go through his in-game idle animation is really annoying and that was seriously the best they could do? Give me a past, something to make me feel emotion for this character, some anguish that they must overcome, some sense of an impending danger to evade, just an event that makes me feel for the protagonist(s). Sadly, there just isn't any.Another point and the final one I'll make is about the buginess of the game. The game is not nearly as polished as one would assume, especially the base game which has two official expansions made. On probably 4 separate occassions I had not followed the 'script' that the mission 'suggested' (and I use the word suggested because the cutscenes rarely connect with the mission's objective) and it resulted in the game not properly triggering events to progress/finish the level. Just so many frustrating times where I would spend 1-2 hours on a level, completely destroy the enemy and just because I didn't do something in order, the triggers did not execute as it should have. It's BS, cheap, and ultimately buggy. The difficulty even on normal can be challenging, but a lot of times you'll realize that you've invested about an hour into a level and you're in an irreversible situation where you cannot win. Save often, turn on the auto-save, and don't rely on it. Save at key intervals to be efficient with your time. The game is frustrating and many times it's not from the player but just the way the game scenario was coded.Now I'm going to say that I would not recommend this game, which I think it fails on so many criteria. It's not a game I would play again after finishing it, not a game I would tell friends about and insist on buying, and it just did not have anything compelling enough to keep me happy while playing. I am not saying the game is bad, but it certainly isn't that great especially in today's VG market. (Overall 3/5)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So first of all... this game feels incomplete. There is so little content for a HoMM game. Especially compared to the last three. Secondly, maybe it would explain in the campaign but is there any reason none of the characters from past HoMM games showed up? (Even Sandro who pretty much is the MAIN ANTAGONIST of this series!) As well as culture for teams completely swapping also. (When did Wizards become Egyption??)I'm normally the last person to complain about graphics but these graphics have aged so poorly. The faces look super serious but the bodies look like a Chibi! How is it a game made 10 years ago and was a cartoonish styled graphics managed to hold the feel of the series much more than this? There are just so many bad things in this game that overshadow good ideas. I like the idea of your Hero helping in the battle. And I like the idea of choosing between normal abilities or combat abilities. But the castles... Hoo boy the castles.So firstly the castle menu is very unfriendly. Remember how in every other Heroes game before the castle was a very simple set up? Press a building and you can see all the things you can build. Right click on them to see prerequirements. Very friendly. Here it BLOCKS OFF buildings you can build later! If you can't build it now then you don't see what you need to build it. But I suppose it's useless anyway since Prerequirements have been removed really! You need to build a certain amount of buildings to ""Level up"" your town hall in order to build later buildings! Making strange combinations and unique building mechanics for teams like in the OTHER games impossible to pull off! The only good thing that came from the new castle is it showing the resources it will subtract from your stockpile right next to each other. That's actually very nice.And don't get me started on the overworld. You feel squished. Remember how in all the other HoMM games all the info was put on the right side of the screen making your map space feel normal as well as giving you all the info in one spot? I guess Ubisoft decided it was too cool for this and tried to put the info ALL AROUND YOUR SCREEN. Moving around the map feels claustrophobic. This game is just not fun. Play any of the 3DO versions instead. They will be much more rewarding.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My first HoMM game and I really enjoy it.I had played my first Kings Bounty game today as well - KB LegendNot sure how I missed these two game series over the years.They are a refreshing change and FUN.I just finished the game after playing it for the first time this weekend.And loved the game so much I bought the Hammers of Fate expansion as well as HoMM VI and also started playing HoMM Online as well.Way back in 2002 I had purchased what I believe was HoMM IV, my first HoMM game and I recall within minutes not liking it, deleting it and for the next 13 years avoiding all HoMM titles.GEEEEEEZZZZZ, what was I thinking!?!On a whim, I played Kings Bounty for the first time last Friday, ""KB: Legend""...I loved it !And also was happy to find out that HoMM and KB are related.This got me thinking to give HoMM a 2nd chance, so I bought HoMM V and OMG I love it!I could not stop playing it!Although, I finished it, I still have Hammer of Fate to play.I would say to anyone on the fence, that if you have never played a HoMM game before but are interested, give HoMM V a try.Keep in mind the graphics are older, but are good enough to enjoy as they are still 3Dish.Or, you can try Kings Bounty first as a test and if you like that game you will like HoMM V as well.Either way, the two games are so inexpensive that its worth it.I loved HoMM V so much I just bought HoMM VI as well and am playing Heroes Online as well.I do not understand the mixed reviews other than the UPlay issues that are forced on you with those games.Happily HoMM V does  not have that issue.

												As a fan of Heroes IV, I had high hopes for Heroes V. Unfortunately, I quickly became bored after just 30 minutes. The voice acting is subpar, the music is lacking compared to IV, and the combat is boring. The flavor text from IV (like when you pick up an item or visit a shrine) appear to have been removed (to be fair, it could have appeared later) I just found the game underwhelming as a whole.

												Wow, how utterly disappointing. Was a huge fan of Heroes 1,2 and to some degree Heroes 3. Somewhere after version 3, this game series lost it's way. This is a type of game that can do without all the ""3D"" crap because it's about strategy, not how garish and inflated the graphics are. Mindless animations laying over the top of impeded gameplay make for an extremely frustrating experience. I mean, trees in the landscape should not obscure items that would be clear to the heroes. The adventure map is meant to look like... a map! The designers have just over done the heck out of this game, so much that it's totally lost the spirit and overall feel of it's predecessors. To add to this, there are actually no significant improvements in the game just COMPLICATIONS. Dress up the graphics a bit of course but always remember to keep the game mechanics simple, playable and fun! All I'm getting from this game drawn out frustration! I could write a list a few pages long on improvements to this POS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really liked Might & Magic IV. The animation, the soundtrack, the characters, everything. I can't say the same for Might & Magic V. The game starts off with Isabel and Beatrice having a conversation. All of a sudden, I hear Godric's name being called. I become really excited to know that M&M V is going to be a direct continuation of IV and that I get to see all of the characters from IV return. When I saw Godric's appearance and heard him utter a few lines of poorly voiced dialogue, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. This Godric seems like a completely different character from the one I was used to in M&M IV (yea I know Godric is much older now, but still.)  Maybe I'll change my review after playing the game a bit more, but right now, I'm just disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not sure what to say about this one. I like the Heroes of Might & Magic series in general, as the stories are fairly engaging, and I like the idea of playing as a travelling knight commander and his/her entourage/army, as opposed to just one overpowered RPG character. It's very pretty, and generally engaging in gameplay and setting. An excellent example of the genre.However, the multiple layers of Ubisoft DRM, which go on top of what DRM Steam already provides, is just mindbogglingly frustrating. What would be a stable game is made highly buggy by the always-connected DRM.If you can put up with buggy, interfering DRM, get the game, as it's kind of amazing when working. However, if you just like the genre in general and don't want to fight Ubisoft every step of the way, go with something in the King's Bounty series. It's not quite as pretty, but it's got similarly fun gameplay, and no Ubisoft.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just remake Heroes III and make it run on modern systems and everyone will be happy.The fancy 3D-model stuff ruined the series and now it's a joke. The artwork in Heroes III was perfect. But now we must have rotating cameras in the city for added dizziness and disorientation to the player, and also this messy world map that can be rotated. SIMPLE IS BETTER, PEOPLE! I will not buy another HOMM title until they go back to simplicity. A simple, elegant art style with a balanced gameplay like Heroes III.Don't get me wrong, HOMM 5 is not the worst in the series. Gameplay-wise, it sort of improved on the broken predecessor. But they went all fancy with the town themes and art style. So the game PLAYS well in terms of balance and strategy, but feels silly and you can't take it serious because the 3D models have this stupid exaggerated style and the town themes are dumb. It's not a world you feel like you want to daydream into when you play like it was with Heroes III.Obsidian went back to roots with ""Pillars of Eternity"" by returning to a SIMPLE, ELEGANT and FUNCTIONAL graphics style, and the game was a success. The same needs to be done with the Heroes series. A new sequel is releasing now, what, is it 7 or 8? I stopped keeping track after 6 because it's ruined now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's one simple reason why this game should be avoided. It is impossible to protect your rear line by slowing / blocking the enemy with unit placement. This game uses a square grid system but allows diagonal melee attacks and movement. It also doesn't have any penalties for moving past an enemy unit. These combined make the tactical combat a joke and eliminate any tactics whatsoever. Your ranged units will always be prioritized and attacked by melee units with impunity. I've played a good share of similar games including HOMM3 and Kings Bounty. It's a general problem that ruins all games of this type when allowed. Other games that I can't remember off-hand do it right and make unit placement actually mean something. Not this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I loved that game and tried all of the sequels, but none of the upgrades improves upon Homm3.This version adds 3d isometric, which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  It does add deeper variation among creatures, which makes the game richer and more complex, but it doesn't make up for the suck factor of 3d iso.

												This starts out as fun with nice graphics but soon degenerates into a tedious slugfest where the AI spawns at lightning speed no matter what you do till your whole experience becomes an exercise in total frustration.  Seriously overrated game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Remembering how much I love Heroes of Might and Magic games, I thought this would be a sweet bargain but this is complete♥♥♥♥♥ It is worse than any heroes game I can remember. It's ugly, it plays like a hot mess and I can't imagine what kind of person would play this over any other heroes game, or any other game in their library for that matter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1 - Great2 - Great3 - Great4 - Great. Using the hero in battle took some gettings used to, but was awesome. 5 - Crap.  Ruined a perfectly good concept of a game by trying to make it into something it's not.The graphics are very anoying, which I don't understand because IV looked awesome.I really did try to play the game, I forced myself to sit down for few hours but it was boring as hell. I've loved all the Heroes of might and magic games until this one came out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update 2014: A note to the steam community: Don't downrate this review because you disagree with it - that's not what the system is for. This is a well written review that points out important strengths and flaws in this game.Update 2015: 27% approval rate, BAH - this is why steam reviews section is littered by garbage! I criticized it as a poor choice as an entry game of the series - for new players. I still think this review is good and the mechanics will be no less puzzling for anyone else than me. There are very few guides and none in English on steam at the time of writing and there's no good tutorial for explaining how to really compete within the game. Oh well - enjoy your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviews then Steam community. :PHeroes of Might and Magic has always been a puzzling franchise to me and the fifth game in the series is no exception. Heroes of Might and Magic V is a turn based game that goes into a turn based (very turn based) combat system when you meet enemies in similar fashion to the Total War series.PresentationA turn based battle system would be an entirely acceptable thing except that the game has so many variables and numbers that trying to get into it is endlessly confusing. In addition to that we have the fact that the ""armies"" are represented by mere numbers and a single unit model. It does seem like the game could have supported far more models on screen but sadly the user interface hinders you from having more than 7 stacks of units on field, this makes the game's presentation of allowing you to command vast armies seem very dishonest to me. It's always fun to stack numbers up but a game has far more potential for visual presentation that the game truly takes advantage of.What really strikes me with the game is it's fantasy. The basic game of Heroes of Might and Magic offers 6 different factions: Haven (Humans), Sylvian (Elves), Dungeon (Dark Elves), Necropolis (Undead), Inferno (Demons) and my favorite Academy (Wizards)! All of these factions feature classic mythological and fantasy creatures and gives them stats to reflect their strength. Every race is relatively well balanced as well I would say, at least for first appearance. Every single race has 7 available unit types and each of them can be upgraded once (or twice of you got one of the expansions). Haven's units starts off with the lowly peasants and end with bloody angels, in-between they have a sweet mix of medieval flavored units. How these armies are built up are pure genius and there seem to be little to no redundancy in the units neither.I also need to praise the city screen with looks glorious and the upgrades to it is amazing eye-candy.GameplayI cannot keep praising the game much longer though. I have a real problem with some of it's gameplay mechanics. First off is the unit growth system. In order to get together an army the player must build special buildings for each type. You even need to upgrade these buildings in order to upgrade your troops. Fair enough. However, there's a serious flaw that your units numbers don't grow without the buildings. So potentially another player could end up with far more units than another, and there's no way as far as I'm aware to even such a setback out, short off trying to win a battle early on. It seems to be then that unless you get a perfect start a game isn't truly worth playing to the end.The heroes do have magic powers that could be used in an attempt to even the odds between the players but these spells mostly cannot be learned (at least not over 2nd circle of spells) without the respective skills in the magic field. This becomes problematic due to the fact that these skills are awarded to heroes at seemingly random. In addition to that the magic spells are also rewarded at random in different Mages' Guilds in different cities. Due to these facts it seems like the game is controlled solely by luck of the draw and little of good skills. In battle the randomness seems to take far less importance, instead the amount of randomness is mostly determined by creature characteristics.The RPG elements in the game seems to amount solely to stacking stats. A hero with plenty of artifacts and a large army seems to be a force of nature and entirely unstoppable. There seem to be no apparent penalty for having large armies like having logistics problems or slow progress, instead large armies travel with the same ease as small armies, making taking on more powerful opponents very tricky and seemingly impossible.ConclusionThere's a lot to admire in Heroes of Might and Magic V. You might have noticed that I like using uncertain words like ""seem"" a lot and that's because I have only played this game for approx. 15 hours yet and I'm still figuring out the quirks of the game. This pretty astonishing to me really as I've been annoyed at several core things in this bloody game and I still keep playing it for some reason. I guess it's extremely addicting and it shows giant amounts of potential. I still think that the greatest flaw as far as I'm concerned is it's presentation. There's never any real big army feel and as time goes on you, as a player only end up to feel more vulnerable. Don't think I haven't searched for any gameplay guides for this game, there isn't any! There's no good documentation either and pretty lousy ""tutorials"" and it shows that this game was made mainly for the fans of Might and Magic and few others.The gameplay in itself is bad enough and due to the lack of being able to even out unbalances during the game's progress and the dishonest presentation doesn't help either - but in the other hand the game is also very addicting, has great potential and the fantasy aethetics are gripping. Sadly because it's so hard to play this game for anyone new to the series I have to refrain from recommending this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Heroes of Might & Magic V is one of those first video games that I remember begging for for christmas and actually got. And the reason why I begged was because I was playing it at a friends house in one of those situations where you and your friends mom are like ticking time bombs with no visible clock, never knowing when they are gonna stop ticking and make you leave. So we went up and started playing some duels in this game which I started to love it because of the close up shots of the battles which in my early tween ages, thought it was the coolest thing ever. However when I got it I immediatly started playing the campain and after a couple missions I thought ""This is boring"" And moved onto the ever so better multiplayer/scenario mode. This made me feel like a boss building up a huge army full of ents and blade dancers and useless fairies. That was until I realized the other army moving into my territory and thought ""Oh crap"" As I moved my mouse over their army and the words ""About as much chance as having that seinior girl say yes when you ask her to the prom you puny freshman."" Well after that I yelled at my computer screen that ""I don't want to relive my freshmen year computer"" And started playing with someone else. Which led me to another point, the point where the game is like monopoly, as there is no winner unless someone puts the game away, and they you are all winners.However, like monopoly the game is fun for the few moments where you trick yourself into thinking 'I can finish' at the beggening. So if you like extrodanarily tactical games and monopoly, take this game and go play it with any friends you can find. The more the merrier. And the longer it is till your turn again.
