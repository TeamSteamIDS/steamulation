												Having purchased this game in the glorious year of 2010, it marked my true entry into the world of PC Gaming. And for that, I thank Napoleon: Total War.It was early in 2010, and a friend of mine had brought a Game Informer Magazine into school one day, we were in 8th Grade at the time. I was flipping through it in our Computer Class, when I noticed ""Napoleon: Total War"" in there. I had never heard of Total War before, but I sure knew I wanted it as I was in a bit of a Napoleon craze at the time. Of course, my teacher noticed me not paying attention on how to type with the home row keys (77 WPM without it, suck on that Home Row!) and took the magazine away from me. I swore on that moment to buy Napoleon: Total War, and to play the living hell out of it.And I did. I bought it on Friday, August 27th. The day I joined Steam. Got home from Target with my brand new copy of N:TW and a twinkle in my eye. ""What the hell is this Steam stuff?"". So I spent the night getting Steam set up. Then came the instiliation. It wanted to download it, but I was getting roughly 30KB/S at the time, and that would take a long, long time. So I went to sleep frustrated. The next day I learned how to install with the disks. A useful tip. Then came the patches.Most of Saturday, and for the morning of Sunday I waited for the patches to finish installing. They finally did. I hopped into the computer chair with glee, the moment had finally arrived. *Click* and I hit the ""Play"" button on Steam for the very first time.I still remember that music in the intro, and the intro itself ""My enemies are many, my equals are none"". The main menu appeared before my eyes, was I really playing this? I hit custom battle - I don't remember my army composition but I was just escatic I finally got to play it. I only got to play that battle though, I had to go to my youngest brother's Football game. For the rest of my Freshman year, it was nearly all I played. Day in, and day out I was commanding armies. I didn't even have an exceptional computer. It was still like a dream come true for me.That my friends, is just the beginning.Napoleon: Total War is the 6th main entry in the Total War series of Turn Based Strategy and Real Time Tactics game. It takes us back to a simpler time, when the French were ruled by an Emperorer. Having the experience of the failures of Empire: Total War under thier belt, CA was able to fix many of the issues that plagued Empire. It feels much more coherent and fluid. It's a better game, with the exception of the scope to some.The map, unlike Empire: Total War, is limited to Europe for the Coloalition Campaigns, and a few smaller maps for Napoleon's Campaigns. For some, this loss of scale is a detriment. To me, it's a plus. The campaigns feel tighter and more worthwhile, and less daunting.The game's score is wonderful, and takes you back to the time period. With memorable pieces, you'll be sure to remember some of these tunes for time to come. It is truly a highpoint for the score of Total War.The units are well done, and represent the uniforms of the period accurately and beautifully, The graphics, especially for 2010 are great, and have a nice feel to them.The game is also extrememly moddable, and there are many mods for many tastes. From small mini mods, to large overhauls like The Great War mod, you'll never be bored with the game.Overall, I give Napoleon: Total War a 10/10. It truly introduced me to the world of PC gaming, and is a real highlight in the Total War Catalouge. It is by far my favorite Total War game, and one of my favorite games that I have played.

												The Total War series has always experienced pressure to create historically correct games. It is all too often difficult to create a turn-based grand strategy game that is on point with history. This is because the game must inevitably deviate from the historical timeline at some point in order to appease players' wishes for open-ended gameplay. That is, make that nation their own through conquest. Well, Creative Assembly managed to hit the nail dead on with Napoleon: Total War. With Napoleon, there's great gameplay without sacrificing much of the beautiful graphic work or experience. You also get historical content mixed into your play. What I mean by this, Is that you will be required (or asked) to follow in the footsteps of the nation you choose to play as. Also, just as in Empire you will find snippets of Inventions or famous happenings from that time.GameplayThe battles are the best part about this game hands down. Playing single battles, online matches, or just enjoying the battles of the campaigns is what this game is about to me. Napoleon brings some of the most realistic combat to the battle maps. The guns and artillery effects will blast you away (pun intended) and you'll immedietaly notice the change in the beauty and accuracy of the battle maps.Introduction of New Systems to Total WarNapoleon was the first game in the TW series to add the Attrition system, where your armies will take slow damage from extreme weather. It is simply a realistic thing as opposed to being able to march your army over the Alps in the dead of Winter and suffer no losses. Attrition is now seen in all Total War titles. The technology tree for this game is also more simplified than Empire's and the diplomatic features are more interesting. If it is one thing that I know gamers like to see out of a grand-strategy game, it's diplomatic options. The choice of ""Liberating"" a country and ruling over it, the choice to threaten your enemy and make them concede defeat, or the many, many others that Empire and other TW games are lacking in. The newest TW games include great diplomatic systems, but it wouldn't have happened without Napoleon: Total War.DLCThe DLC options that are available for this game are  pretty decent. The DLC campaign is The Peninsular Campaign, an add-on featuring a British campaign against the French in the Iberian Peninsula. Playable factions include Britain, France, and Spain. There is also a great extra 'Propoghanda' element to this game, where you can win over populaces of territories simply with your nations' influence.There are also three Special Unit packs which are all great to improve on your existing armies. The Coalition Battle pack, Imperial Eagle pack, and Heroes of the Napoleonic Wars pack.Pros:- Historically accurate objectives, troop units, ship, maps, and battles.- Inclusion of Napoleon's Italian and Egyptian campaigns and most famous battles. These are great plays.- Graphically breathtaking- The best and most realistic gun/artillery work that I've seen in a Total War game (More realistic than even Fall of the Samurai)- Introduces Attrition, new Diplomatic features, and new military management mechanics (i.e., auto-refresh troops, 'wounded' Important General such as Napoleon or Blucher, etc.)- EducationalCons:- The AI, as in most of the Total War games, is a bit lacking. However, it's still a major improvement from Empire's AI.- Vanilla game only allows you to play as Austria, Prussia, Russia, England, or France. With modding you can play about a dozen other small nations.- The scale of the theatre covers Europe and the mid-Mediterranean, but still feels a bit cramped. Also, the edges of the ocean are treated as Trade Posts to other areas of the world.- Regional Online Play (as with many of the Total War games)Verdict?8/10I can't not recommend this game. It is a pillar in the Total War series, whether you love it or hate it. Napoleon satisfies a battle-map junkie's dream while also giving the player a rewarding experience in the campaign theatre. While the game tends to be historically correct and a great learning experience as well, it almost forces your nation in the footsteps of that country with objectives. You don't have to perform these objectives, but you are rewarded greatly for doing them. The battles are the best experience in Napoleon, hands down. The gun and artillery mechanics are finally done justice and the battlefield in general just has a more realistic feel to it than Empire or previous games. The feature 'Napoleon's Campaigns' also gives you access playing the Italian, Egyptian, and European campaigns which are incredible fun.All around I would recommend this game to anyone interested in the Total War series. If not simply for the realism of the battles and the fantastic graphics/effects. The features of this game are pretty great and represent to me a game-changer in the Total War series.

												Napoleon: Total War is easily the most divisive of all Total War games. Some folks love it, some folks hate it. It is, to be fair, an almost carbon copy of Empire at first glance. The most noticeable difference is that Napoleon concentrates exclusively on Europe whereas Empire allows the player to conquer the globe. Beyond first blush, Napoleon does feature some improvements over Empire that make it worth consideration. Chief of those is better coding - Napoleon is accepted by most to be a much more stable and better running game than Empire. It is also better looking. AI is supposedly markedly better, however that is debatable. There are a number of mods available that greatly improve the Napoleonic experience - but you're fine running the stock game.If Empire and Napoleon look too similar to you - if muskets and dragoons are all the same to you, you may prefer Empire over Napoleon due to the globe. But... If, like me, you have a fascination with the Napoleonic Wars, you owe it to yourself to give Napoleon: Total War - beyond dominating Europe, there is also a series of historical battles and campaigns that are very enjoyable.

												The early vanilla version of this game was pretty good, but limited in many ways: a very predictable AI opponent, limited number of playable factions, minimal battlefield music and sounds, relatively small field 'armies' (max 20 units, usually with a few thousand men total); this is barely a brigade in the actual Napoleonic Wars. Yes, the initial version of this game showed a game with a solid foundation, but unrealized potential for such a fascinating period in history; full of pagentry and spectical, when hundreds of thousands of men clashed on huge battlefields dressed in colorful uniforms with gloriously ornate flags, batteries of thundering cannon and thousands upon thousands of clattering muskets. The designers missed an opportunity to really do something great. Then they failed to developed the uniform editor they had promised for the game and that didn't help. They just didn't seem to want to go the extra mile. I liked the game but was a little dissapointed, even with the DLC they added later.Then I discovered a mod for this game called 'DARTHMOD NAPOLEON v2.6 Epic Edition' and quickly realized this game's potential. Darth Vader (the mod's author), teamed up with a group of similarly talented modders and buffed this game up into something special. They vastly improved the battle sounds, music, unit flag details, battle smoke, etc. They added so much detail that it was like a new game altogether. You can also play the game now as almost any nation state of the Napoleonic Age, which enhances replayability enormously. Want to try building an empire with Ireland, do it. Like to try conquering Europe with little Portugal or the Duchy of Warsaw (Poland), sure. It's harder with these small factions, but it can be done; and with a smaller faction it's a real challenge. This mod also allows 40 unit max armies and 30 unit max fleets for many of the major nations, making for huge battles on land and at sea, and the units can have as many as 500 men in them; so a land army with this mod can often contain 12,000 to 15,000 men. On the new scale, with all the aforementioned visual and audial improvements, the battles become like interactive movies; they are a joy to simply watch, let alone get actively involved in. One warning though: you will be very busy trying to control such a large army. After a big battle you will likely feel a bit worn out, and you will be wearing out the pause button during the battles, both for your army's survival and a means of taking a break from the action just to appreciate the amazing beauty of whats going on before your eyes. It's really quite astounding. You pan in and hear men muttering in the ranks, horses neighing, orders being given in the units and so on. The sea battles are just a spectacular and just as labor intensive (but worth it).Yes, even with DARTHMOD NAPOLEON, the AI could be better, but the rock-paper-scisors tactics of Napoleonic warfare are alive and well. Charge a well formed infantry square with cavalry, bad idea. Let your infantry stay in line when cavalry charges, bad idea. Form infantry square within range of artillery (especially cannister), bad idea. Leave your cannon batteries without infantry or cavalry support to protect them, especially from enemy cavalry, bad idea, and so on... The one main problem I have with game play is the morale model, especially for the French and for cavalry units in particular. I often see units almost die to the last man that should have long ago fled the field. A batallion of 360 men with 20 or 30 left should be long gone, and certainly should not have 'steady' morale. Still, I can overlook this issue and the others that are less severe, because they are so greatly outweighed by the good points of the game. I have come back to this game over and over for the last few years (8,000 hours plus listed but probably about 1,200 to 1,500 or so actual, when you exclude the time the game was in the Strategy Map planning mode or paused in tactical mode). There is really no other game like it for the Napoleonic era, and the entertainment value and unbelievable replayability (with Darthmod installed) are amazing.If you like Napoleonic Wargames with spectacular, realistic battles, rolling drums, booming cannon, thundering cavalry charges, shattering musketry, beautiful, fluttering flags and a smoke enshrouded battlefield, you'll love this game.

												An excellent game overall. Creative Assembly have redeemed themselves more or less from the disaster of empire with this. The AI is a little wonky at times, and the unit sizes are far too small, but the way to combat the negatives of the vanilla version of the game is to download darthmod from modb or the total war forums and it works beautifully. Darthmod increases smoke effects, unit sizes, number of units, campaigns...with this mod, Napoleon Total War is my most played game. The vanilla is good, darthmod make good become great ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far one of the best in the Total War collection, it improves on the gameplay and multiplayer aspects where Empire Total war left off, lacking a large scale camapign it focuses on smaller camapigns based around Napoleon's life (simular to Rome's Alexander dlc). If it be single player or multiplayer this game does both extremely well and you can end up spending hundreds of hours doing both or even just having a ""blast"" with your friends			",218,17,4,39,43,1,52

												For me, this game is a complete 10/10. Especially if you download and use the Darthmod plugin, it adds a whole new dimension to the game. It makes your armies gain sometimes more than 200% unit size. From a 60-man Jaeger squad up to 200 men in your division. I would greatly recommend although you have to be a certain kind of person to like this. If you are nót that kind of person, don't buy it. You probably won't enjoy it. I have a little bit over 120 hours into this and it still hasn't become boring. The campaigns offer really versatile land- and sea warfare at tons of different locations with different strategical set-ups for every single one of them. You're in the hills? Bring infantry. You're in a flat area? Bring artillery, lots of it. Play this game and see how time slips through your fingers like fine sand.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Four Star Scottish General Kyle Kinnard was killed at the battle of Sardinia, 1806. His forces, comprimising of only 500 or so Highlanders, tired and worn out after the beach landings a week earlier, were greatly outnumbered and outgunned by superior Sardinian forces led by an unkown general. General Kinnard had arranged a defensive position similar to his 'semi-hexagonal' formation used at the brave and successful defence in England a year earlier. However, his luck was used up, and, under constant artillery fire and cavalry charges, his men, although fighting valiantly, were in the end routed and cut down. General Kinnard elected to stay in battle. He fought till the last man. He was struck in the shoulder by a musket round and fell off his horse, killing him.---RIP General Kinard, 1778~1806, we will not forget---			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was as Moderator of a big German TW forum at SEGA in Munich / Germany when Napoleon TW was shown by Creative Assembly to the folks 2 weeks before release. The game brought many features and improvements which were missing at Empire and which ... what I know for sure because confirmed later by a member of Creative Assembly ... were planned to give with Empire too. I'm not talking about the Multiplayer Campaign alone, but about things like the craters in batllefield, improved AI behavior in battle (slightly better as at Empire), more provinces as for example ""Meckelnburg"" north of Prussia or ""Oldenburg"" north of the Netherlands or ""Hessen-Kassel"" ... as well splitting France and Spain into more provinces. People asking why this was not done in Empire too get the correct answer that the game machine has problems to handle more provinces and factions as given ... and that's for example the reason why in North America is huge area with no province Between the East and the Plain Indians. Here in Napoleon the focus is only on Europe and so the map could be splitted into these further provinces and factions. Also, other things like the Arsenals were in origin planned to give with Emipre too as well things which were introduced / changed by the Darth Mod in Empire were here at Napoleon given by Creative Assembly.The game makes fun, no doubts ... as well it is again much improved by playing with Darth Mod. It is always interesting that the Greek modder Darth Vader and his team are no wizards here, but as still done at Empire, they change and improve existing things in the game ""only"" ... something what developers of Creative Assembly had to do by their own with proper testing in my opinion.The historic battles and the way of Napoleon with Italian and Egypt campain are a good thing and well done as small level campain feature. One change in the game done at battles is the sort of infantry fire with no fire by ranks etc. Take a closer look and scroll down in a battle to a unit and count who is only fires and make comparison to Empire. Another change is the splitting into 2 types of howitzers with different ammuniution, which I can't really understand why done with historic view on it, but also with gamers view.Conclusion:In general Napoleon is an improved Empire on Europe map only, officially justified by Creative Assembly that this war was on land only in Europe. This is histocally true, but the map of the main campaign should be something bigger by including the same area as Europe in Empire ... means complete Turkey, Palestine / Jordan / Syria, North Africa and in the west the sea area up (and including) Iceland ... as well complete Scandinavia. Pure by number of provinces and factions it ia fact that the game machine could handle without problems and so it is for me not understand able why Creative Assembly did not include.The game itself wasn't so bugged as Empire at release and worked very good. One point I can't forgive is some type of lie done by Creative Assembly here:As part of the promotion of the game and clearly written in promotion text it was told that ""modding tools"" will be given. Sure, most players are casuals and so lesser interested in modding a game, no doubts, but when a company tells it in promotion to give, then it is to rate as promise. People who asked them after release when these ""modding tools"" will come and what they are able to change in game was not told much and if any official answer came it was only a short consoling. Some month later, the promotion text was over night changed and the part with the ""modding tools"" wassimply deleted without any comment or reaction when people like me asked them about it. Result: Which modding tools should be given can people ask now and CA could answer we never told! Fortunatelly I have a screenshot of the original text and even if these tools are not much worth in practice, this behavior of CA is not acceptable!			",8,0,0,1,12,0,9

												Napoleon Total War is a Tactical Wargame set in the Napoleonic Wars. That is why Napoleon Bonaparte is in it. Made by Creative Assembly ages ago, it was the first game I had, and the ultimate reason I ever got Steam. 3 years later it is still among my favourite games, and I still play it - though to a much higher quality than I used to. Set in the Napoleonic Wars, as stated above, the main Campaign covers Napoleon’s Campaigns in Italy, Europe, Egypt, and the Peninsular. You are put in command of the French army, and in a certain amount of turns, must complete the campaign ending in a French victory. These campaigns are fun to play, and it feels good to replicate Napoleon's later military career, slaying his foes on the field, though I must be honest I do not think it is the best part of the game. Alternatively, if you do not want to play as the French, there is the ""Campaigns of the Coalition"" option where you can play as any one of the 5 military superpowers of the era. Those being France, ♥ Great Britain ♥, Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Depending what type of campaign you play, they vary in length and difficulty, but you must strategically put your foes to the sword in your best efforts to meet all of your objectives, thus making your nation the very best it can be. Elite not only in Military and Navy, but also economy, and technological advancements. I wrote a campaign guide (For Great Britain) which you can view here, showing and explaining in more detail what you can do in a Campaign, and things that may aid you, such as Spies, Gentlemen and of course your control over the Government, and how to use them effectively. Napoleon really stands out from all other Total War titles in its battles, which are extremely well made. While I do not like many of the maps, and wish perhaps there could have been more, for the most part, games both multiplayer and single player require a lot of strategy and logic to win. There are varying difficulties, though with some experience, the AI soon becomes too easy for everyone, but each demand a more thoughtful approach to the tactic you use in order to ensure your ultimate victory. I've also made a guide on how I fight battles, again as Great Britain. It was made a while ago, but my tactic hasn't really changed. Sorry if it's written badly in places, but I didn't want to edit it for memorabilia :D This is my opinion, and many don't agree, but I believe Napoleon was the best Total War game. It's interface is simple and easy to use, but effective too, while still looking good. Graphically I think it walks all over the likes of Shogun 2 and Rome II, despite is age in comparison to the two. The combat engine is good, and fights, both shooting and melee, are fun to watch. The only criticism I do have are its musket sounds. They are quite bad, but this doesn't ruin the feel of the game. Another reason I am so fond of this game is undeniably the era. I really like the Napoleonic wars, and oddly enough this game sparked my love for it three years ago, and so, to me, there is not another Total War like it. I've no interest in Roman or Medieval history, so perhaps my high opinion of it is partly because of that. Overall, it is a great game. It's few small floors such as men charging the wrong way, and infantry not forming square in time for cavalry can be annoying, but they don't kill the game for me. I would give this game a proud 9.5/10. It's Creative Assembly's best work, and since then it's on a steady downhill decline for me, with their terrible interfaces and annoying camera restrictions in games such as Shogun 2 and Rome II, but that's for another review. Thank you for reading my review :)			",102,29,1,10,16,0,14

												Empire: Total War is a great in my oppinion, although it do have some elements that should have be done better. Average optimalization or many identical looking units for each country (i.e. line infantry) gave you that feeling that it could be done better. Fortunatelly, year after the release of Empire, Napoleon: Total War came out.What does it offer? - a lot of great looking units (including a lot of exclusives, of course); - several well made campaigns presenting Napoleon's career in Italy, Egypt and in whole Europe; one campaign that allows you to play as one of the strongest countries among anti-French coalition: Great Britain, Russia, Austria, Prussia;- a lot of historical provinces (with some errors like Warsaw as the capital city of the province of Great Poland, while the real capital of it is Poznań);- a lot of nations that can be freed or can free themselves;- more options after conquering a province (you can choose for example if you want to annex it or create a puppet if there is possibility)- breathtaking naval battles; - being Napoleon in one of his historical battles (i.e. Austerlitz, Borodino) including battle of Waterloo, which can be made historical (playing as Great Britain) or ahistorical, trying to win this battle by playing as France.This game also allows you to play a multiplayer campaign with other players, Nice thing, especially when you can try to play as for example Ottoman Empire and try to beat your mate who is playing as France. Normal multiplayer battles allow you to play 2vs2, 3vs3 or 4vs4 games with a lot of maps: from classic grassy one to those that need good maneuvers to win. Some people who leave the game might be annoying, especially when it's ranked and you're winning, but in general it's a lot of fun.Summarizing, Napoleon: Total War is a very good game that has got the things that weren't in Empire and adds some other improvements. If you like Total War series and Napoleonic age, then you're definitely going to love it! :))			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic InformationTitle:  Napoleon Total WarDeveloper:  The Creative AssemblyPublisher:  SEGAGenre:  RTS/TBS hybridGeneral ImpressionThis game managed to fix and improve the unstable and finicky engine that it shares with Empire: Total War. That is a feat worthy of apreciation by itself. Also, Napoleon TW features well designed mini-campaigns which unravel the Emperor's story from his humble beginnings (the tutorial for this game) and all the way to his final defeat at Waterloo. Make no mistake. It is not an easy game but neither are Napoleon's achievements. Europe was never the same after his reign and neither will you after you have played this game on the only dificulty it matters. The hardest one. If you're playing strategy games on Easy or Normal, you're doing it wrong.Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics.+ Modding potential.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Weak AI in its vanilla form.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												Starts a campaign as Prussia based in East Germany- Makes alliances and trade agreements with Russia, Great Britain and Austria- Builds up technologies and military infrastructure, begin to invade France with 3 armies- Captures all of France in about 25 turns- Paris has about 3 major rebellions, all of which are crushed- Spain declares war on me as they are allied with France in this scenario, sends 2 small armies over that are instantly crushed- I send 2 of my successful armies over to Spain, push them right back to Madrid and capture it- Portugal feels threatened and declares war, big mistake and after a major loss against their military we eventually force them to surrender, both France and the spanish peninsular are now mine- Madrid has at least 2 rebellions which are dealt with easily and is to be expected- Invades Saxony and all the other smaller nations in the european theater- Russia and England declare war out of intimidation- Conquers all of russia in about 20 turns due to their lack of tech - England destroys 2 fleets in the channel, i crush their invasion force outside paris- England falls in about 15 turns later after begging for peace - Austria and my Swedish allies are all thats left standing, declares war on austria and takes over all their italian territoriesSuffers about 8 defeats from Austria but takes their capital from behind, which then suffers from 2 rebellions- After about 30 or so more turns all of the old ottoman empire and austrian regions have fallen21/10 would conquer all of Europe again GLORY TO THE PRUSSIAN EMPIRE			",149,23,0,19,12,0,38

												Napoleon Total War is just a glorified Expansion for Empire Total War. It's a very fun game, but if you are looking for a good single play, don't get this. From all the Total War games, this one has the weakest singleplayer campaign. If you like the time period, get Empire Total War. Although Napoleon has a smaller map, less factions, less diplomatic freedoms and a very poor AI, it has a good multiplayer, graphics are better and the battles are more engaging.

												Napoleon is more or less an advanced expansion for Empire.  The campaigns are more story-driven and some basic changes have been made to get rid of the more tedious aspects of Empire's campaigns.  Also, the battles are slightly different due to the later time period.  Overall, if you're a fan of Empire then you will enjoy Napoleon, if not then I would suggest trying Empire first.The Peninsular Campaign is the most fun I've had with a separate Total War campaign.

												Napoleon: Total War is a strategy game from Creative Assembly and published by SEGA. Napoleon: Total War is a sequel to the previous game Empire: Total War.Napoleon: Total War is set and focused on Napoleonic era while retaining almost everything from Empire: Total War, but perfected in this sequel. Features are almost the same as Empire: Total War but with more focus on their category. Troops will now replenish their losses automatically on friendly region, mostly decreasing micromanagement for the series. The campaign map is refocused back to Europe but still large.Graphics doesn't seems to have some big improvements. But the troops animation now plays more smoothly than before.Basically, Napoleon: Total War is a perfected version of Empire: Total War with a Napoleonic era focused. While the game is pretty similar to Empire: Total War, it is better than Empire: Total War. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			",1158,351,58,143,167,12,228

												Played campaign as Prussia on easy. Had read a guide telling me to capture local city-states ASAP to get more territory quick. Do so, accidentally cause war with Denmark and Sweden. Austria hates me, all city states are wary. 99/10 Would f*** up again.But on a serious note, this game is extremely fun. The campaign map is smaller than that of Empire TW, but still good. Just be prepared for Britain to sit on its♥♥♥♥♥the whole time and not help out with the Frenchies. (Should you decide to be an enemy of ol' Franzmann)The mods for this game, although not as diverse as some other games, are still awesome. My two favorites are the Great War Mod, and Darthmod Napoleon. The GW Mod does exactly what it sounds. Converts the whole thing to WWI. My front line never moved, though my tanks won entire battles on their own, with no help from the rest of the army.Darthmod makes it pretty, lots of smoke, explosions, and morale-y stuff. Also giant unit sizes. 320 man grenadier units, 500 man Landwehr units, more swiss troops, an impossibly large number of French units... like Westphalian Fusiliers (whoopdeedoo)Anyway. Enough of my ranting. JUST GET THIS GAME. Graphics are pretty good, just put the settings up, Also some dialogue is rather entertaining. Artillery isn't too OP (in vanilla NTW at least)Final rating- 1815/1799, would hit napoleon with a cannon ball again.Don't forget to mod!			",21,3,0,0,5,0,4

												Napoleon Total war is a brilliant game, graphics are beautiful and the campaign is intruiging. For another time The Total War series have shined. Napoleon Total contains an excelent multiplayer system, even thought it has some connection errors. But besides that I like it. Napoleon total contains many units and many ships. And the Diplomacy tab is very good too. But the most interesting is the campaign where you must leader Napoleon to Glory! I reccomend it. 79.6/10			",16,4,0,4,7,0,8

												Fixes what Empire got wrong, but leaves out some of the things that made Empire great. If you are interested in multiplayer, I would rather recommend Empire as the game is more balanced. Napoleon suffers from balance issues online. Everyone tends to always either play England or France as they're the strongest nations, and there aren't a diversity of playing styles like there are in Empire. I also find players tend to play quite dishonorably by camping, spamming artillery, unicorns, or other cowardly tactics. For campaign: I found Napoleon to be very fun, although slower and a bit more challenging than Empire. What I missed was the  epic grandness that was in empire, however fighting in regions as opposed to countries made much more since. I didn't like how I could easily march a stack into Paris and completely take down France in ETW.  The Campaign AI is also much more sensible, and you have more diplomatic options like Joining Wars, creating Trade Embargos, and Cancelling Alliances. The battle AI is still terrible. A half-decent player will mow through battles to the point that fighting battles will get tiresome, but necesarry if you don't want to get screwed by the auto-resolve. I must admit after 3 hours, fighting armies gets downright annoying.  Still, it's an enjoyable game worth getting. However, Empire lasted much much longer in terms of replayability, grandness, and online fun. Napoleon's online experience is extremely disappointing.Update: Still tons of bad players in this game. If there were a better community you might see me playing more often, but every game is hosted by a coward trying to tip the rules in their favor, camping in spawn/deployment with artillery, putting weather that disadvatages one army over another, just lame♥♥♥♥♥♥ I've only had a handful of enjoyable online MP games in napoleon. It's still terribly unbalanced with a terribly poor community. So many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players. Most of them have memorized the maps and how to exploit them, for instance, playing ottoman on desert maps with high dust and camping in the corner so enemy will be exhausted no matter what they do. Adding an extra 30 mins to the game just so they can win without using any tactics. If you like REAL battle tactics, this is NOT the game for you get EMPIRE instead. If you like doing cowardly♥♥♥♥♥♥and playing like a ♥♥♥♥♥, then get napoleon and just the rest of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s with no skill.			",35,0,0,0,1,0,6

												I got this game, I have not played it very much, but I do have one story for you. Gather round children.I though, ""Yeah, I've studied the Napoleonic wars, I'll be good at this game!"" so I hopped on multiplayer.At first I thought I would be good. I lost all of my Cavalry and most of my Infantry within fifteen minutes. The only reason I was still alive was because of my artillery.Then I realized something: I was going to be Wellington. I was going to recover and route all of his infantry.With the rest of my Line infantry, I ran, leading them into my artillery on a hill. With a combination of cannister shot and Volleys, they were breaking. Then, his cav charged and killed most of my infantry.But I have forgotten about three units.Three units that I had moved into the trees at the start of the round and forgotten about.My rifles.I quickly moved my rifles into position. They quickly killed many of his militia, causing a route. His cav tried killing them, buy my riflemen were not fazed. They killed almost all of the cav as they charged. When they met my brave riflemen, we lost one man. His cav was dead by my brave riflemen.Then, in a last ditch effort, he sent in his Grenadiers. His elite infantry against my rifles. They outnumbered them, and they were stronger.But my Brave riflemen did not run. They fired on them from afar, then, without giving the grenadiers a chance to recover, the brave riflemen, who were full with energy, charged against the tired, wavering grenadiers. My brave riflemen killed all of the Grenadiers.The brave riflemen, the last men on the battlefield, the only men to have not routed or died, had won the battle.Heroic Victory.10/10, would forget about riflemen then say ♥♥♥♥ it and charge again.

												Amazing game even though graphics are a bit outdated.I recommend to get the mod named ""Darthmod Napoleon""  that add better graphics and new features to this ""old"" but fantastic game  http://www.moddb.com/mods/darthmod-napoleon( to start with the mod, install mod and start mod from your desktop.. next start game from steam and you should see a new image with darthwader and napoloen... Choose the new campaign that was added, now you can example play as any nation in the game ;-)    )   I recommend to maybe reduce smoke graphics.game also allow your line infantry to become more realistic, and AI tractics become much better than original game.Sorry to disspoint you of a review but im sure you find other good reviews who better tell you about gameplay and so on.

												One of the best Total War games in my opinion and still competes with newer total war and RTS titles today. + Huge variety of historical units and regiments, like the Old Guard or the Blackwatch.+ Awesome Combat + Great balance overall between units and unit types, Cavalry can kill light infantry easily, but line infantry kills cavalry and so on.+ Alot of Nations to pick from, who all bring different units and ""focuses"" to the table (for example: Russia has very good melee stats)+ The maps are very big and dont feel too clumbed up like in newer titles. + Most Maps provide a variety of strategy you can use+ Siege Battles feel great and pretty balanced, which is hard to do- Minor Nations (Like the Dutch or Denmark) dont have alot of unit variety and their units are practically worse than the units of big nations in every department- Some maps encourage camping due to 2-3 choke points that have to be pushed through- Artillery has infinite ammo- Most Players dont allow Artillery which leads to constant camping/skirmishing fights Overall, I highly recommend you buy the game (especially when it is on discount). It is one of the best Total War titles out there and definitly worth your money.			",61,3,0,1,14,0,14

												Absolutly the best Total War. Here's why:- I have over 400 hours in this offline and 260 online, so I've played it long enough to know it's solid.- Improved from the ground up: Empire's engine is used to great effect here. The map is larger, but the campaign as a whole is smaller. Not a problem though; you'll be too distracted by the enhanced strategy of it to notice this.- Story Mode; Story mode is great for those who are after a more story driven experience. Imagine the Rome 2 Caesar in Gaul expansion, but in the 18th Century and with more scope.- Darthmod Napoleon. There is no better TW mod. You'll hear fanboys saying this, but it really is true; try it for yourself. The ai will stun you. The stability will awe you. DM Multiplayer is also still very much alive, though you do always have the option of switching to Vanilla on startup.- Polished; it is second to only Shogun 2 in terms of polish; graphics, gameplay; it just works. I also have yet to have a single crash in this game. - Naval combat; pretty much the apex of Naval in the series imo. Great selection of ships, tactics and variety of battle possibilities. Quite simply superb.- Versatility; runs on any system; OSX, PC, Old, New.- Re-Playability; I find myself keep returning to NTW. Sure, new ones come out and i'm distracted. But I always find myself back with Musketeers and Jagers.			",2,0,0,1,2,0,13

												Napoleon: Total War is the 6th game of the Total War Franchise and is released at 2010. Napoleon: Total War is a historical turn-based strategy game. The game is really fun to play and with your volume button it sound more realistic. I am a great fan of historical strategy games. I've played a lots of strategy games and I must say; Napoleon: Total War is my favorite (for now). Napoleon was one of the greatest emperor and general in history. The game lets you play a lot of generals and even Napoleon in his campaigns. At the beginning I've started with the tutorial, but after a several minutes I got bored so I started with the Italy campaign on easy mode. When I played the Italy campaign I started with recruiting soldiers for the France Empire, but you need to wait several turns. In the main time the enemy was approaching my lands. When I sent all my armies to enemy countries to capture them the crisis started for France I lose more money then I get. Because of the bankruptcy I couldn’t recruit more armies or upgrade buildings to make profit. I've started the campaign over and tried it again but with better tactics. After I finally completed this campaign I started to play multiplayer, but I can say the multiplayer is dead except you’re a high rank. I tried to find online campaign games for the achievement, but there wasn't any except some locked servers. So I started to host one after some minutes someone joined and I started it, but there was one problem: the game crashed and windows said there was some unexpected error and closed it. I were not able to achieve the achievement. My impressions of the game.The game is sure fun at single player, but I can't say if you get the same fun with the single player campaigns. I sure liked the sound it gives you the feelings to play more and more.....Pros and Cons.Pros.- The game is fun - The game isn't easy to complete, even on easy mode- The sounds gives you more feelings to complete the whole game (at least for me)- The game has trading cards- Amazing graphics- Choices you make decides your empire- Variety in historical characters, like generals and soldiersCons.- Multiplayer sessions are hard to find- Multiplayer crashes - Achievements are hard to get The game is fun and amazing, but I don't recommend the game for achievement hunters or people who wants to play multiplayer. If you just want to play alone then I recommend you the game for sure. This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												Well with just over 109 hours of my life playing this game, I can indeed recommend this to those who enjoy a late Sunday afternoon of killing the french and laughing with your English friends, but all jokes aside. Napoleon: Total war is a game that has a level of strategy that will cause even the best of the game series to sit down and think of their next step in overthrowing their opponent. Many of you who read this will know that Napoleon: Total war isn't the first of its kind, as you already know that the Total war series takes you to different time periods, pushing the player into different scenarios that will test the player's skill to direct his/her army to victory, by any means necessary. In Napoleon: Total war, you fight against the AI in some well done (short) campaigns. But the real meat of this game is the online aspect. Sadly, not many people play this gem, as they say, that Empire: Total war was the better of this time period. I will decline their opinions and state, that Napoleon sits in favour of my taste. The game does better to sit you in the midst of the battles, not only reducing the factions you can choose from but giving them a bit of their own flavour and the diverse nations to bring their own types of units (Up to a max of 20) into battle to take own another player, whom has most likely just chosen their favourite faction that they always play with. Many probably won't believe me, many won't care. But Napoleon: Total war is easy to pick up, but hard to get good at (Not a hard learning curve). Because at every turn, someone will surprise you, whether it be a sudden and devastating surprise attack at the rear, or maybe they have decided to lure you in, only to bring in the good units at the last moment to seize the day. No matter your play style, you will find someone (Mainly if they have better than 3 stars) that will put up a challenge and make you feel like a general, fighting your own battle and making your own tale of glory. Oh and it has a turn-based campaign, but nobody really plays that. If you want to play the campaign, go get Medieval 2 or Shogun 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has to be one of the best, real time strategy games ever made. I still keep coming back to this game, and hope that there will be a Napoleon II, just like they created a Rome II.Multiplayer is brilliant. Some of the best games have been 4 on 4, on a large map, taking hours to finish. Hide units in a forrest and carry out an ambush. Learn to use your howitzers differently than your canon.Don't use your cavalry too early.If you like real time strategy war games, this is the best.And for the record - I don't like Rome II - just saying they need to make an up to date version of Napoleon, were the infantry automatically form squares when they can see they are about to be charged by cavalry and a few other improvements.

												I think that Napoleon is a pretty nice step from Empire, even though they are both pretty good. Napoleon includes the ability to liberate nations and set up their protectorates, like Romania, Brittany, and Poland. The system of converting buildings and the nice tech tree are also pluses. Some things I don't like that much are the limits on generals. Also, no religious agents, although given the short campaign time, they would not be able to realistically and significantly convert populations. Finally, one of my favorite features carried over from Empire: national buildings. For example, the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow.			",3,0,0,1,3,0,5

												Best $5 I've ever spent.Unlike any other strategy game I've played, Napoleon Total War blew my mind. After my first few hours of gameplay, this quikly became my favorite game of all time. The campaigns are enjoyable and make sure to include important points of Napoleon's career. The battles are always exciting and immersive, and the attention to detail is wildly impressive.For someone that would like to give Total War a try, this is your game.			",18,2,0,0,5,0,6

												""In the realm of forest and snow, they said Russia could never be tamed!...and...they were right...""What more can I write? It is a historical total war game, you get battles and campaigns. If you like the Napoleonic Wars, the WWII for 19th-century Europeans, the war that everybody wants to be in and fantasized about, or that you fantasized about being Napoleon or Wellington or a French Imperial Young Guard or a Russian Cossack, then this is the game for you.

												This game is amazing, it is also the first Total War game I have bought, and it was an excellent one to start with...The campaigns in general are very good alone, but you must download darthmod for this, it completely reinvents the game and makes the battles at least 2x as fun. The game is very simplistic and easy to follow and pick up, while still rewarding the strategic thinker and those who plan ahead. It is amazing to play as France and just defy everyone and steamroll Europe. Only bad thing is that their is not much besides the grand campaign and Napoleon's battles, although you can't underestimate how fun the grand campaign is.8.5/10 Perfect for newcomers and verterans of the series			",12,0,0,0,0,0,4

												I was alone, and cold on a rainy day in Mecklenburg. When I was approached by a man, who put his warm body to mine and whispered in my ear, and I'll never forget what he said to me, in that smooth, buttery voice of his, he gently whispered. ""Damn this weather, Sir! Wet powder makes misfires a certainty!""Oh yeah..as for the game..It's a good game, great if you like the time period, and a smaller scale than Empire, but it still has all the issues that plague Total War. Check it out when you get the chance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: November 8, 2016
												Pros and cons of this game.Pros are that it is graphically polished and optimized and that there are no staggering and unfinishness like in Empire Total War. The map is tighter and encompases Europe from the Spain to the Moscow and from the Mediterranean to southern Norway and Sweden. Single player introduces the option that was missing in Empire TW and that is looting of conquered towns which brings you money or option of making puppet states of selected conquered national regions. So you can essentially be an European puppet master who forms huge puppet states dependent politically of you which give you money and with whom you can trade and have steady income. 2nd huge thing different from Empire is that your troops automatically replenish losses in friendly or allied teritory. Also now you have expanded diplomatic options where you can ask your allies to join your wars or you can give them proposal to stop trading or breaking alliances. The AI often gives you similar propositions which are usually to their own gain and your loss. Cons are typical for most recent vanilla total war games - vanilla AI is criminally stupid, battles are arcadey, soldiers die too fast, firepower is buffed to the degree where bayonet attack is pointless. Also there are only 5 playable factions and number of Napoleonic era troops is limited to few generic groups like ''militia'', ''line'', ''elite'' etc., with pretty much similar stats. And game engine cannot endure modding or unit multiplier that adds more soldiers to the units, and that is where all recent total war games stagger. It doesn't help even if you have a beast of a PC with huge amounts of ram.All those things can be fixed and given depth by installation of mods. This game is practically worth of investment because of mods who give it depth and complexity. Personally, I played vanilla limited time and dissapointed by its usual arcadey SEGA style for casual majority of bored gamers I switched to mods. Now once you have tried mods for this game there is no turning back to vanilla and you would be sattisfied.Same goes for Empire TW or Shogun 2 or Rome 2 or Attila - the engine and battle mechanics are pretty same, despite latter games being without firearms - soldiers still die too quickly and it completelly ruins those games. Now with mods, some of them supporting multiplayer, installed this game is worth investing into and I have no regrets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Next to Shogun 2 this is the best Total War I've played out of all of the releases. The battles are simply beautiful and the campaigns are fun as well, only negative is the small scale and lack of alternate factions you can play as, though this game is really centered around France, Spain, and the Coalitions so its understandable. Also this is one of the few games based on the Napoleonic Wars and they did quite well with the attention to historical details which for me is a big plus in any video game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Napoleon Total WarThis is a pretty good game. It is basically Empire Total War with a few changes. It runs and plays well. I like the soundtrack in this game.There are not as many small kingdoms as in Empire Total War. Battles tend to be large. Both of these things can be positive although I like having many smaller kingdoms on the map. Of course a long Empire Total War game has fwe remaining kingdoms late in the game and most are rather large.This is an excellent time peroid for warfare. Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry are all useful on the battlefield. There are many cool units during this time period.There are off map trading sites similar to those found in Empire. These trading sites are nice for extra income.Napoleon Total War is one of the good Total War games. Total War games are great. I like them. I need to spend more time with Napoleon but am hooked on Empire for now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THINGS THAT KEEP THIS GAME FROM ABSOLUTE GREATNESS: - battle AI to easy too exploit - ridiculous diplomacy (also highly exploitable)- little factions not playable (though some of them played a significant role with respect to the conflict)- boring technology exploration- resource-cheating AI which makes a lot of strategic decisions pointless- painfully slow naval battles (I know, thats how naval battles are in general...)- no drum and fife for non-french armies (such a great feature in DarthMod - why is it missing?)- cavalry attacks from behind have less impact than in Rome TW oder Medieval TW (visually and from a tactical perspective)- siege battles completely broken			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Napoleon Total War is overall a improvement from Empire Total War, it had a much better launch with far less bugs. Many of the gameplay mechanics have been refined and improved, with new onessuch as new abilities to Spy. The AI is improved but still pretty bad, some battles they are frozen. Whilst Napoleon Total War is overall a better game, it is not as engaging as Empire Total War, It is on a much smaller scale than Empire and features a less varied gamepley. In Empire there were 3 continents with serveral cultures such as the European, Indian, Middle-Eastern and Native American, therefore the player had to adapt according to which they were fighting. In Napoleon TW the map is focused on Europe alone, with a small Ottoman Empire in Greece. This meant that While I could easily start a new playthrough after completing one in ETW, I could not in NTW unless if it was one of the the smaller campagns in Egypt and Italy. Pros- Far more refined than ETW          More interesting Time period          New and Improved features          Better Trade systemCons-Far less engaging than Empire          Less Variaty of gameplay          Doesn't feel as epic as owning a whole continent			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first Total War game I bought and my most favourite as this game has some of the best mods out there like The Great War Mod,Darthmod and Napoleon Total War III.The only slight negative is that the campaign map is a bit small as they could have added the peninsular campaign and and a few more playable grand campaign factions.Also there is great multiplayer as there are great maps and historical units. 10/10			",58,6,0,1,15,1,10

												This game will never be too old to be played, it's worth its price and the multiplayer is still populated. The only bad note is that players will always try to ""cheat"" avoiding rules, cornercamping ecc... so play with your friends, others can't be trusted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Started playing Napoleon Total War again and i would say it has stood the test of time. Yes Total War Warhammer's graphics look far better and there are so many new things, but compared to Rome Total War 2 and it's problems it is a really enjoyable game. There are a few AI issues, but overall i would buy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Napoleon : Total War  , is one of the best Total War series game. This game has all that i ever wanted to see in Total War :- Multiplayer campaign- The history (Napoleon wars!) - 3 other theatres of war (European Campaign, Italian & Egyptian)- Good technology tree (In my opinnion better than Shogun 2 tree, because Napoleon has those universities that are improving the speed of reaching technologies) - Graphic is pretty goodBut... It has some minuses :- The multiplayer is not much improved- You can't play those smaller countries, like Sweden etc. , maybe some people will not agree with me, but i think that playing as small country would be really interesting and would be challenging to the group of tryhardink people.------------------------------------------------------------------------------From me, that's all. It's one of the best games of Total War series (just after Shogun 2), and it's really worth to play. I would recommend this game to the every Total War player. Cya!			",41,3,0,12,4,0,11

												The Total War Series is my most beloved gaming title on the PC, and this game was a huge step forward for the series at the time of its release.Napoleon: Total War touches up on features from Empire:Total War but also adds more of a in depth look into the combat of the Napoleonic Wars Era.I'd say this game has by far the best depiction of musket and line infantry combat on a large scale.You can have literally control thousands of troops and depending on how you win or lose battles, the generals commanding those troops will gain traits and retainers. Coming from Shogun 2 however, this feature lacks to me only because they are auto asissigned traits, where as in Shogun 2 and Rome 2 you can choose the type of traits, behavior and entourage you want your generals to have. This game (like Empire in my opinion) focuses more heavily on the combat as opposed to being focused on building up cities, having a repuation to keep up with or decisions to be made based on your actions.The AI in Napoleon is up to par but is still un-polished and buggy in some areas, you also have to remember this is a relativly old game (4 new total war games have been released since this game)SINGLE PLAYER & CAMPAIGN-The campaign is fun being very much different pending on the battle and campaign difficulty you choose and has much replay value, on top of that  there is plenty of DLC to download/buy. In total there are 4 diffrent campaigns to play (Europe, Spain, Italy and Egypt)You can play these in single player or multiplayer ether being enemies or coop or both throughout There are a huge variety of units to choose from in this game, if you have the right technology of course. You will notice that alot of the units look the same with similar uniforms and hats, but that is how it was in the time period, again i highly recommend the DLC's because you will acquire over 30 + more units and it will help very much in both single and multiplayer.MULTIPLAYER-For me this game is all about the multiplayer. There is a ranking system which is what keeps me playing. Although you will come across lots of slight or big lag, people quitting and people lagging out, I truly wish they would re master this game. You have to repeat rules in lobby constantly and you can't restrict units to certain rules you want to apply, so new players or trolls choose units not allowed.You will get frustrated if you care about rank, but if you are playing for fun there is plenty to do :).Siege, Naval, Land And Historical battles are available for both single and multiplayer.Pros+-Stellar graphics for a 2010 title-Awesome Single Player & Multiplayer-Unit Variety-Historical Accuracy & Realism-Runs on High - Ultra graphics smoothly on low end PC's-High Replay ValueCons--Multiplayer games crash fairly often and lag, needs to be remastered 0:)-Some bugs when it comes to garrisoning in houses and firing on certain positions (Hills, Corners etc)-Outdated AI  ",43,1,0,6,5,0,10

												This game was one my very first Total War experiences. It provided me with hours of fun and enjoyment. Not to mention the excellent modding community behind this already great game (DarthMod,Napoleon Total War 3). It also has a excellent campaign and it provides a almost complete backstory for Napoleon. Though not many people play this game anymore. I would still reccomend it to my friends and to the Steam Community, *I had a disk version of the game outside of Steam before this.			",42,1,0,4,6,0,5

The game is so immersive and with plenty of mods available to download, the fun won't stop as soon as you conquer Europe! The addition of Napoleon'c Campaigns along with the DLC of the Peninsular Campaign makes for an amazing Napoleonic experience that you could only dream of. Great game, definitely worth a play.

												Pretty good game overall. Managing and bulding up your empire is probaly the most fun thing about it but the battles are still awesome.

												I grabbed Napoleon Total War on a sale years ago for reasons I cannot really remember. Maybe I had been playing Shogun 2 and enjoying that, and thought it would be a good idea to throw money at Creative Assembly.Napoleon has the same two layers of war that all the Total War titles do. You've got your Campaign Map strategic layer where you recruit troops, upgrade settlements, research technology, partake in diplomacy, and move your armies around conquering, retreating, or what not. Then you've got your Battles (when two armies meet on the map) which plays like a slow paced RTS where positioning and unit composition mean the difference between victory or defeat. I enjoy both layers of the game on their own, and put together they make this franchise. It works pretty well here as it does in all Total War games.Empire Total War was very buggy for my then-computer and I didn't really enjoy that style of warfare, so I went into Napoleon Total War with low expectations. It grew on me pretty fast. I still question some of the game design decisions. Select your infantry unit, right click to attack an enemy unit like any other RTS? No. They'll be inefficient and terrible. Napoleonic warfare seems to be a lot about forming big lines and just sitting there, and on a lot of battles you do just sit there and watch your vast lines of troops slowly slaughter vast lines of enemy troops.Napoleon Total War feels like polished Empire Total War, and now that it's several years old I had the pleasure of playing through the game on maximum settings and resolution while maintaining a framerate above 60 at all times (usually above 100). It was not without technical issues. I experienced several Crash to Desktop errors in the Italian and Egyptian campaigns, but none in the European campaign. In battle, there were occasionally weird white-square graphical glitches that would flash across the screen. The campaign map had a few weird audio beeping glitches. At this point, assume there will be no patches for this game, so know you may be getting into some of that.As someone chronically bad at RTS, though, I found ways to enjoy this. I would always try to field 3-4 units of cavalry, and while my line infantry sat there awaiting battle in guard mode, I made my own fun micromanaging a few cavalry units to harass enemy artillery, lone cavalry, or generals. By the time I had to pull my exhausted cavalry back, battle would begin, and I could often micromanage my artillery or tighten infantry lines. I enjoyed the historical approach to the campaigns. The tutorial campaign teaches you a bit about Napoleon's life while learning how to play the game. Each successive campaign after that is slightly larger, unlocks more of the game's complexity, and follows Napoleon's historic conquests. The Italian campaign only has a few factions and is landlocked on a small map, with no diplomacy or technology research. You learn to fight and do some basic economic management. Beat that and you're off to Egypt, where they introduce naval battles, technology research, and a medium-sized map. Finally, you take on the European campaign which is often called the ""Grand Campaign"" in the other Total War titles. Europe (and parts of Eurasia) are rendered on a huge campaign map with plenty of factions. I enjoyed the steady increase in difficulty and complexity. If I had dove right into the Europe campaign I would have done terrible, but after beating Italy and Egypt, I felt ""ready"" for Europe. Good design.I never enjoyed the naval battles much. My own ship AI seemed terrible, requiring massive micromanagement. Any more than a few ships was beyond my effective control, so I ended up building huge navies and autoresolving those conflicts.This part of history still isn't my favourite, and I have a few other Total War games to play in my preferred more ancient settings. But if you're into Napoleonic warfare, this was a surprisingly good game to immerse yourself into. Of course, it is very similar to Empire Total War, which has a more global feel, and in terms of scope that might take the cake. But if you're happy becoming Supreme Emperor of Europe, this is quality game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's difficult to take a break from video games when such visceral and tactile sexiness like Napoleon Total War exists. This game is disturbing my profession, my life as an artist. I just can't wait to get back to warring against France as Prussia. The battlefield, with Darthmod added, creates scenes straight out of some of the artwork of the period. An ingenious game where you share a room with a campaign map attempting to delegate, with precision and balance, the growth of your nation, or kingdom, with battles on a beautifully rendered map. The sound of muskets popping randomly along the long stretched line of troops, the war cry of cavalry swooping in to crush a bewildered enemy, artillery slamming on top of multi-colored troops, the chink of metal as the war ravaged troops fight until lack of morale or blood drowns them in a dusty North African battlefield, or a rain-drenched European battlefield.I have so few complaints about this erudite piece of entertainment, for the exception of, perhaps, the lack of maps for skirmish mode. There's just not much in variety of maps, but I will not allow the lack to hinder my pleasure of this well done and crafted piece of art.The vanilla game is excellent but if you have the space and the time add Darthmod to enhance it to near perfection. I just can't recommend this game highly enough. The Total War series deserves an applause, especially Napoleon. :-) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+Fantastic gameplay, in both campaign and battle+Units are unique for all the major factions, but similar enough that they are balanced example: The UK and France rely on highly trained professional armies (UK with KGL Foot, Highland Foot, the 42nd, 88th etc. and France with the Old Guard, the Young Guard etc.), the UK are more accurate than most factions, and the French have extremely high morale.+Multiplayer Campaigns+Fantastic mods (NTW3, DarthMod just to name a couple)-Gameplay gets a little repetitive after a while-Not many playable factions (5 in campaign), and the minor nations you can play in battles are pretty much just generic units~No extra theatres~AI is mediocreI'd say that Napoleon is probably my favorite Total War title, with Shogun 2 coming in 2nd and Medieval 2 coming in 3rd.I highly recommend it			",25,3,0,5,2,0,10

												The Good:Very fun and in depth game. Few games give you this time frame in world history and let you have the option of both fighting on the battlefield and taking a tactical world view/city managing view of things.The Bad: If you are a single player type of person, this game is not for you. The AI battles are incredibly easy even on the hardest difficulty. The AI troop movements are as if they all suffered some type of dabilitating disease and have become mindless zombies, walking straight into cannon fire and allowing my army to completely destroy them before they even have a chance to attack. This is game breaking for me.Overall:For the price of 20 bucks it really is a fun and fast fix. the battles (though the AI is as dumb as a box of rocks) are very in depth and create a lot of oppurtunities to have fun and expiriment with different unit types, ",31,1,0,4,1,0,8

												 Easily one of the best games in the TW series. Napoleon Total War allows you to play as the Emperor himself, Napoleon Bonaparte on one of many campaigns. You can also play as many other heads of state of the times, although the Napoleonic Campaigns remain the most engaging and entertaining.  Combat is brutally realistic, this game is like watching an epic historical film. Every battle you win, and every enemy you outsmart brings you a feeling of satisfaction like no other.

All the  important battles of the Napoleonic  period are set in the game.  For you to fight over once again. Defeat the great military strategist,  Napoleon, or be defeated and fall to the wayside of history!       The military action is pretty awesome!  You can command huge military units, from artillary to calvary units.             I enjoyed  playing the game.  I think you will too!  Can't comment on the multiplayer section because never played it.  But I'm sure I would  enjoy it just as much as playing  single.  Recently started playing this game again, now  fully loaded with all of the DLCs! Enjoying playing it once again!   So I recommend it, purchase it and join the battle.  Viva la France!

												Napoleon total war is a decent game though i have played empire total war first and feel like Napoleon is just dlc with better graphics compared to the other total war games the campaigns are gutted though gameplay is decent you just don't get a large pallet of factions you either play as britan austria prussia or russia in the coalition campaign or there are 3 Napoleon campaigns. so you can't just be a nuetral nation watching from the sidelines while you go off and destroy someone else. all in all it's a 6/10 barely making a yes for me			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many people think that shogun 2 is the best in the series, but I disagree, I think this one is the greatest total war game, and one of the best games in general. First of all, I liked Shogun and all, but       the battles in it lacked the strategic elements that this one has. If you play these games for the strategy, then this is the one for you.

												Top class game that I have spent many hours happily playing. Others have mentioned all the details but I will say that of all the Total War games, multiplayer on this game is brilliant and arguably the best out of all of them because of the diversity of units and game mechanics. For wargamers, the graphics depict the uniforms and colours of the age very well. The Peninsula campaign add-on is also excellent and was my favourite single player campaign.			",7,1,0,12,21,1,22

												In terms of actual strategy, this game is quite limited. The research and construction are primititve and offer little strategic planning. The AI is terrible; They attack your full stacked cities with a single unit and dont bother to shore up their borders. Raising difficulty really only affects your economy and the rate of enemy troop recruitment as well as the morale of your troops. For example, you can have an experienced line unit that breaks after a few volleys from a unit of MILITIATheir live action battles is still the best in the business however and this is a huge improvement on Empire. Also, multiplayer battles and Darthmod/NTW3 really make this game that much more realistic and exciting. Sega needs competition to get them off their arses, recent games have stagnated and their DLC policy is straight up robbery (5 bucks jsut for blood effects in Atilla, Warhammer). So I guess overall, despite its drawbacks, Napoleon is still very enjoyable and Ive logged many hours on it ! Hope this helped			",7,0,0,0,1,0,4

												Overall, Napoleon Total War is an OK addition to the Total War series... Features:Great Naval Battles, best in the seriesBrilliant special affects and graphics n' shiny things. Nicely done Campaign map. Multiplayer Campaigns. Good Artillery affects. Generals acctually mean something...INCREDIBLY STUPID AI!!!!!!!!!Gennerally laggy Multiplayer, much more so than Shogun 2, Rome II, and EmpireBUT great singleplayer performance.Not much unit variety, except for the Ottomans and some rather epic French and Russian Units (and some Scots, never forget the Scots) there isn't much unit variety. HOWEVER!!!!!!I would like to say that this game is made 1000% better with Darthmod. If you're wavering with the above, I would suggest buying the game, playing it to get used to it (even if you're a TW vet this one is a wee bit different in terms of UI) and then immediantly downloading the mod. It fixes the AI, doubles (or more) unit sizes without lag, and adds EVEN COOLER special affects, like more unforgiving wind in Naval combat, better cavalry physics and chare affects, and some lovely musket noises...Overall, I'd reccomend this game (as you can see I've certainly spent my share of time playing it), esspecially with Darthmod. However, if you're new to Total War, I'd reccomend Empire (and Darthmod Empire!) or Rome 1.			",28,0,0,9,4,0,12

												The thing with this game is that it is unique. It is one of the only strategy or total war games set in this period. What? Empire total war? Please don't buy it get this one instead. Furthermore Napoleon offers some excellent mods. Just try the Great War or the American civil war it's so much fun. Base game is nice as well as it is challenging enough in the end game but easy enough for beginners to get in touch with the mechanics. Last but not least, it is a fun way to learn a bit of history.			",9,0,0,4,4,0,11

												Although this game, in my opinon, should have just been DLC for Empire: Total War, it does fix a lot of the bugs it's predecessor suffered from and decreases the scale a bit, which works in it's favor. It also improves the graphics, which is a plus with all things considered.			",58,6,0,18,15,0,31

												Amazing game if you like the Total War Franchise and strategic games, I always play as England, France or Spain and destroy everything in my path, I always do this when I'm playing the campaign and always get the militia units, I never get the hardcore amazing OP units, Maybe 2 grenediers and one Guard unit to protect my general, I always do the realistic stuff with this game! It's quite fun doing the hardcore stuff though. This is probably the best Napoleonic Strategic game out there in the whole world, I absalutely love it!- Very Good Optimisation- A lot of options / setting to configure- Realistic Napoleonic Wars Formations- Real time battles, Such as water loo battle and lots of realistic campaigns that Napoleon, France, Austria & Spain did!I see no downside to buying this game, It's awesome! Probably the best Total War Game (my opinion)			",44,2,0,4,10,0,13

												I never played many TW games, but I think it's one of the best. Medieval II was great, but graphics and animations... Rome II is the second best, but imo Rome is more simple than NTW cuz there aren't any powder weapons. Can't say anything about Shogun II, haven't seen any gameplays. When I buy the game, the most important things are: graphics, story and mechanics. This game has good graphs, story is also very good AND the mechanics are great. NTW gets even better when u install some mods (Darthmod - great mod, you can play every faction you want! I recommend Poland, hard to get good relationship with Königreich Preußen and Erzherzogtum Österreich while making the best choice - attacking Российская империя, especially Vilnius). If you love history of Europe, I really recommend this game, but be aware: you can't family share this game (or at least I can't :<)!			",44,3,1,6,3,0,3

												Napoleon: Total War was an interesting addition to the Total War series, created in hopes of improving upon the mechanics of Empire: Total War. On it's own, the game is not remarkable at all, but with the right mods, it suddenly becomes one of the best strategy games out there.NTW obviously takes place in Napoleonic times and features prominently a series of campaigns that mirror Napoleon's wars from the 1790s to 1815. The main campaign of the game is his European war effort from 1805 to 1812, beginning with the War of the Third Coalition and ending around the time Napoleon was trapeezing about the Russian steppes. The campaign, like all Total War campaigns, features elements of economy, infrastructure, and regional control that bring about challenges to building your empire and maintaining control, as well as feeding, paying, and supplying your troops. In addition to this and the usual mess that is diplomacy, NTW features weather prominently, with zones of attrition existing across the map, in places where weather and terrain  demoralize men while also killing them off. Spend too long in one of these zones, and you will have no army.You can also play the parts of Russia, Britain, Prussia, and Austria, in this European campaign. It should be mentioned that without mods, you cannot play any other nation in this or any of the campaigns (which include an Italy-centered campaign and Napoleon's expedition to Egypt. In both of these, you can only play as the French). This totally take away from the fun of ETW, in which you can take any nation that existed at the time and turn it into a dominant power. And, because the game mechanics sevearly tilt the odds in favor of Napoleon (which is both fair and unfair), playing as any of the afore-mentioned powers can be a fruitless struggle in futility and swarms of French soldiers.The battles themselves are where NTW, as all other Total War games, truly shines. commanding vast armies of a thousand soldiers on the field of battle in real time is exhilarating. NTW did a particularly good job with programming for soldiers (it is a step up from ETW, which is a relief to many), and especially with artillery. Spectaular graphics make the battles all the more incredible, but this has always been a hallmark of the Total War series. And of course, there are some problems with battles in NTW:-1) You really can just sit there in a defensive starting position while the enemy AI bayonet-charges you. It's like Pickett's charge every ♥♥♥♥ing game.-2) Shooting mechanics are not accurate for the period. There is no firing by rank, and light infantry, which have the same weapons as normal line infantry, can shoot as far and as acurately as most riflemen. -3) AI controled soldiers are prone to fire towards you, no matter if there are three units of their own men in front of them. Again, it's not much of a fight.-4) Battles seperate from campaigns have the added benifit of a complete lack of variety in maps, most of which seem to be geared towards tournament play. NTW does offer compelling battles, when fought against other players in Multiplayer mode. They even tried to add in multiplayer mode for campaigns, which was a brilliant idea and could have been wonderful but instead is a poorly-programmed piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥The only way to have fun while playing a campaign, or to add fun while playing multiplayer, is to use the mod known as DarthMod. There is a DarthMod made by independent sources for every Total War game, and in NTW it is almost essential to have this mod in addition to the game. The mode enhances the sound quality, texture quality (smoke lingers in clouds, and blood splatters when soldiers are shot), melee fighting programming, the number of soldies per unit (from around 160 to about 360!) and most importantly, AI programing. Soldiers now fire by rank, and the AI is a cometent and worth opponent, both in battle and in campaign. Additionally, you unlock every availible nation with DarthMod. I've gone on rampages as Hannover, Portugal, Bavaria, and many more.In short, if you are looking for a good Total War game, this is probably not the one to get. However, if Empire was your favorite Total War game, or if you prefer guns and cannons to spears and arrows, then get this game and the DarthMod for it. Without DarthMod, NTW is a 4 out of 10.With DarthMod, I give Napoleon: Total War an 8 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Have you liked Medieval 2 or Rome Total War? Clash of iron swords and armours? With Napoleon Total War there is nothing like it anymore. Now the smoke of gunpowder, the power of cannons and use of your timing and tactical skills, will help you win. You will plan to out maneuver the enemy.

												A great stratagy game and historical setting. Was very pleased with the World Domination Campain, though the time limit for ""Victory"" or ""Defeat"" seemed a little pointless because you can keep playin after the set year it ""ends"". Mechanics are beutiful, easy to pick up and figure out - and leaves a lot to the stratagy side. Balancing range of weapons, moral, weather, hills or obstructions. A very detailed and well loved game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Have you liked Medieval 2 or Rome Total War? Clash of iron swords and armours? With Napoleon Total War there is nothing like it anymore. Now the smoke of gunpowder, the power of cannons and use of your timing and tactical skills, will help you win. You will plan to out maneuver the enemy. You will put down their lines of defense and in the final moment strike with bayonets.

												NOTE: It says I have low hours on this game, but this is a different acoount. I have invested hundereds of hours into this game. I see a lot pf people go straight to multiplayer, or capaing mode. I will tell you this, you will FAIL. But this is what makes the game fun. By watching my friends and other players, looking at the way they decimate my army, I found so many tactics, the way your supposed to use troops, which factions to choose, I learned so much. This is my favourite part of the game. You can make your own tactics, build your style of army, and play the way you want to not the way the game wants you to. For new players, I reccomend playing battles against the AI. You will enjoy it, it's really simple, and you'lll just get a hang of the game. I never got into the campaing mode, but I loved doing seige battles, land battles, but not so much sea battles. The sea battles arn't as good as other total war games, but some may disagree. What I say, just play the game, and you'll have a blast. Don't go on youtube and search up tactics. Make your own. That's part of the joy of the game!I think if your into total war games this is the best one. Napoleon is my favourite total war game by far. I highly recomend it.			",30,5,0,4,9,0,4

It is a huge improvement over Empire:Total war, And the DLC force you to change playstyles with the different units. The AI is a bit dissapointing when it comes to fighting, such as when I charge with cavalry they don't form square, or how the artillery would target my fencibles when they were in thin line instead of attacking my foot guards who were in squarepros-Very good gamea large array of units, and most countries are playable.first person mode is alright, and when your guy shoots, you spectate the bullet (insert to first person)Cons-Bad AIThe map feels cramped ",58,3,0,7,6,0,8

												All in all I think 'Napoleon' is a bit better than empire. It feels more polished and I think graphics are better, too. I'm playing the coalition campaign with prussia at the moment which is like a mini grand campaign (no grand campaign the scope and size of empire, sadly). I am having a lot of fun so far but artillery and cavalry are really surprisingly weak compared to empire darth mod ( I never played empire vanilla). I tried 3 army compositions, one with focus on either arty, cav or inf. Results were that arty and cav are in my opinion almost useless. I play on highest battle difficulty and the only unit which seems to win battles reliably is special infantry with very high range like prussian 'jagers'. Arty doesn't really hit and heavy cav barely stands a chance against line infantry. I mean, I read that prussian cuirassiers (heavy cav) weren't allowed to wear armor so maybe that's why they have such a hard time defeating infantry? Basically only good to reliably mob up unprotected arty or alrdy fleeing leg infantry. Now, I am pretty sure that mods can fix this issue. Napoleon is a very polished mini version of empire and should be instantly bought when on sale! Make sure, you get the bundle with all DLC included!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're deciding between Empires and Napoleon, get Empires first and whem you get bored buy the second. It's a simpler version of Empires but runs in the same engine than Rome II (shity game): so better graphics, better gameplay; lots of options removed, one map only, and shorter campaign though. The period is a little ahead and your units reflects that, in such a way that is like youre playing a 1790-1810 empire timeline. It's Nice			",6,0,0,0,6,1,7

TL;DRGreat game to watch epic battles unfold without having to think too much about them, but not one to expect any challenge or strategy out of.The Good+Great visuals+Good sound design for its time+Battles are epic to watchThe Bad-Some bugs, such as audio glitches and units not following orders, but nothing game-breaking-Very little variety and replayability, there's little choice in what to build at any given place, only a few buildings in general, and every faction plays basically the same-Very little challenge, even on higher difficultiesThe ReviewI've been a fan of Total War for a good few years, but Napoleon slipped past my radar until a year ago when I bought it on sale and for some reason I just couldn't get myself to play it. Well, today, with a bit of free time, I decided I was going to start a campaign. I never would have guessed that today I would also finish it.I'm by no means a great Total War player. It takes me around 100-200 hours to take over every province on the map in most games in the series. Most of these games have early hours of figuring everything out, building up a bit of a base so I can afford to expand out and carefully picking out weaker targets that I can claim without upsetting our larger, more powerful neighbors, trying to create the best armies that can adapt to varied situations and create new tactics on the fly, winning some hard fought battles with bare-minimum units, establishing a pattern of stretching my borders and then building up infrastructure to support the expansions and taking a little bit to restock my armies and pacify the locals before starting the cycle all over, each time a bit bigger and a bit more efficiently until what begin as a bunch of dudes in tshirts with sticks has become an armoured, trained fighting machine backed by a growing culture and economy and somewhere a point comes towards the end where my economy really starts booming beyond what I can even spend and suddenly countries are falling left and right to my juggernaught of economic and military might as I storm across the rest of the map, so powerful that even if everyone banded together they could not stop me. It's a culmination of a hundred hours, hundreds of turns of planning and pacing and careful execution that feels cathartic as I realize the whole world belongs to me. That final push is what Napoleon is all about. A big part of the Total War experience is the struggle at the beginning: starting from nothing and building up, but Napoleon gave me everything to begin with. I didn't really have to put any work in. The units you start out with are fantastic. Indeed, my first recruits were winning my final battles. There aren't many upgrades, and it's debateable whether the new units you can research are even better at all, and there's very few technologies to research either, further giving the impression that you've begun at the end with all the build-up completed for you. The building in this game is also incredibly restricted to the point where it felt token and unnecessary, like how some FPS games give you the opportunity for a health upgrade or two and call themselves RPGs. There's generally only one, maybe two options that you can build at any given place, so even in this area the game has set up everything for you. You just have to click the picture to build what they've decided should go there (you can also set the computer to manage the building automatically, which at this point might just remove some of the tedium, though I never tried it for fear something interesting might pop up at some point. Nothing ever did.). You begin with such a strong infrastructure that it's more a matter of holding the unbeatable hand you were dealt than fighting your way to the top. That's not to say the game is all bad, though. The fights look and feel intensely cinematic right from the start, with muskets and rifles and canons blasting and smoke filling the air and men dying by the hundreds from battle #1. It was awesome to watch the fights unfold, and the game is beautiful both visually and in terms of audio. That's great, because there's really not a lot for you to do during the fights besides watch things unfold. Every battle I partook in I won easily with the same simple strategy. Every fight went the same way. The enemy always reacted exactly the same. Every faction used basically the same units and fought in exactly the same way which meant that the country divisions were basically meaningless and every battle melded in my mind so that I can't describe any single battle, but rather just what ""the Napoleon battle"" is. My PC really didn't like the naval battles for some reason, so I just ignored it, and yet still came away with the strongest navy in the world: it was, according to the game, twice as powerful as the next strongest navy on the map. Likewise, my army was composed of basic units throughout the entire game that all used the exact same strategy for every single battle and always won, even though some units, especially cavalry, would decide not to follow orders but instead to make up their own galavanting across the map instead of taking a few steps to the side, or charging at enemies to the left instead of ones on the right I had targetted. My spies never failed in their missons, my gentlemen always won their duels (though the effects your spies and gentlemen can have are so insignificant and unnecessary that it wouldn't matter had they all lost), everything always turned up my way. It felt like someone else had played the first hundred and fifty hours of the campaign and then decided to let me have the last 10 once they felt like it was too far gone for me to mess anything up. And that's all it took. 10 hours to beat my campaign, and a good part of those 10 I wasn't even at my computer, though really it felt like the game should have just played itself while I was away for all it expected of me. When I looked at the ""prestige"" screen to find that the only nations left were my unnecessary allies and that I was more than twice the prestige of the next strongest group even in areas I had given no thought to, all I could think was that there really was no other way this could have gone, and that was a disheartening thought. Even Napoleon himself fell while I watched a video on YouTube after setting up my men in their basic formations, assured that they would win without my help.If you love the endgame of Total War and find the early- and mid-game a chore, you'll love this game because it really is just a ready-made endgame set up and waiting for you. But for me those early stages are where the challenges really lie and the necessity for thought and strategy and planning is what entices me to keep playing. For me, the endgame rush is only satisfying in light of the beginning, and with that gone it feels pointless and hollow. I struggled to find motivation to keep playing even for one day, where before these games have lasted me for months. I tried other campaigns as well as the historical battles and was met with more of the same, easy, mindless victories.I could see potentially how this could be a good starting point for people looking to get into strategy games or the Total War series because it does a great job of holding your hand and leading you down the path to victory, but for those who want a challenge I cannot recommend this game. The victory of a Total War game rests on the knowledge of the struggle you went through to get there, and this game takes out the struggle. It delt me a pair of aces, and as I watched the dealer some how turn over 5 more aces, I couldn't feel accomplished or proud of myself when none of my opponents could beat the hand I'd done nothing to win.

												This game is really good the gameplay is solid and if I was reviewing on the gameplay and graphics alone I would rate it an 8/10But if you are looking to start playing multiplayer I absolutely could not recommend this game unless you plan to play it with some friends. I say this because in the 9 hours I have tried the multiplayer I have only played THREE battles. And that isn't because there is a lack of games being started it is because a good portion of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s hosting them have an ungodly hatred for players who have a one-star ranking which means people who have just bought the game have extreme trouble finding good matches and when they do people don't want to be on a team with a one-star because they think ""Oh God he is a one-star I am going to lose if I team up with him"" and then the game ends up with either a bunch of one-stars vs veterans at the game or other players begging the host to kick the one-star because they want more experienced players on.The first game I played was 3 one-stars vs 3 5 stars we lost of course, then the second game no one wanted to be on my side so the host gave me an AI ally, finally my third game was the ONLY game where players greater than one-star were on the same team as me, it was a great experience.So unless you have a friend who you can boost your stars with I would not get this game for the multiplayer as it takes a great deal of blood, sweat, and tears before you can find a single decent host. I unfortunately do not have such a friend.The campaign mode is alright, not as good as Empire though.I assume the multiplayer could be good if you boosted your rank.So I would give this game a 6/10 if you are unable to boost your stats and an 8/10 if are able to boost your stats.TL;DR The game is fun but the community need to get those logs out of their asses and not worry about ranking.

												After putting in over 30 hours into this wonderfully crafted strategy game during the era of the Napoleonic Wars I can say for sure without a doubt that any tactically player or historical player will LOVE this game! Imagine managing any one of the multiple major nations at the time such as Russia or Britain, allowing you to make any decision from controlling your government, trade, industry, research, diplomacy and of course your most important is your military. Now not only are you given objectives to complete within a certain time period but also it gives you the chance for European domination as any one of those major nations. Plan your nation's expansion across Europe allowing you to pick any strategy possible from either destroying large nations to annexing smaller nations into your unstoppable empire! Once you're tired of playing Napoleon's 3 campaigns (Italy, Egypt, and Europe) you can play as any of the coalition nations against Napoleon's France or play multiple different battles that were decisive turning points in history from The Battle of Waterloo to The Battle of the Nile. Finally once you've completed all of that there is multiplayer that is quite entertaining when playing campaigns or battles with friends or anyone else too. Overall this is a pretty good Total War game to buy for you and a friend to play sometime together as a team or as foes.			",49,3,0,6,8,0,16

												This game has a lot of great ideas and is fun to play if you aproach it with a basic understanding of historical battle tactics. However there are a lot of elements to control all at once and the AI is clunky and unhelpful (surprise) so larger battles can get out of hand quickly. That being said, I still enjoyed it a lot.

												This would be one of CA's most successful games in the Total War Series. Now for those who don't agree with me, I kind of understand why. But this game is fantastic in my opinion and I'll say why:1. The game is very beautiful. Even though the battlefields are very similar, its a beautiful game. Its like shogun 2 but in a ""clearer"" way.2. Its almost a better version of Empire Total War. It does have the simialr musket era but only difference is that they differ in differerent time periods. Empire is more of during American Revolution and Napoleon is well, Napoleon's time!3. Its fun! Though it's multiplayer is quite small last time I checked, its still awesome to play!4. Mods. That one word can make any game great. THis game has many great mods like The Great War mod (ww1) and the american civil war! (sorry for my♥♥♥♥♥♥grammer...)Now Here are the negatives:The one thing CA does tend to lack in is AI. Like Empire and its past games, the AI is quite, well, dumb. Its not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like it'll charge everything it got at ya but at least it knows where to position its trooops and all. If you get Darthmod, its like the AI got a boost of 100 IQ. No Joke....BUT OVERALL, GREAT GAME. A GOOD 8.9/10			",52,0,0,1,1,0,7

												Napoleon: Total War is a turn-based strategy game that starts during the Napoleonic era. Playable factions are the great powers in Europe at the time. Unlike to Empire: Total War, the map in Napoleon: Total War is quite small and contains of only Europe.Best strategy is to ignore your enemy's army all together and to blitz his regions. His troops will disappear entirely if you have conquered all regions of your enemy's home theatre. Two new mechanics were introduced: 1. Your troops will slowly replenish its soldiers in your own and friendly territory. 2. Weather: Don't attack Russia or other cold regions during winter or you will lose a lot of men.+ factions have a lot of regions+ Each faction has different units that look great. Check out France and its late game elite units+ battlefield map is actually fun unlike to Empire: Total War's+ a lot of mods that improve on the base game+ research tree+ If you conquer a region, you can sometimes decide to liberate the people, to annex the region or to force a protectorate on them. + Much better optimized than Empire: Total war- the AI is very bad on the campaign and battlefield map.- barely any naval invasions- fort battles are broken- there is sometimes an odd sound bug on the campaign map. can't believe it's still in the game!- The campaign map contains of only Europe, which left me craving for more.- protectorates rarely get attacked by your enemies. So you can abuse the mechanics and make factions like Venice a protectorate in order to secure your flank, which will be safe forever.It's sometimes difficult to decide if you want to play Empire or Napoleon Total war. Empire has a bigger map and more factions, but Napoleon is overall more polished, runs better and has a much better unit variety.Replay value: Average (the campaign map is too small to keep the player interested)Rating 8/10Recommendation: Yes			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do recommend it, but only if you have a strong interest in the Napoleonic era.The game interface is buggy, the strategy map is going to overheat your fans, and once in a while it crashes.The campaigns are not too difficult, and do have some historic value.If you've played Total War before just know it's not going to be as smooth as (the first!)

												Improved artillery units and cavalry units. In this Total War game, morale finally begins to mean something.  Controlls are a bit more smoothed out.  Campaigns play well and provide significant challenge on higher difficulties.  Campaigns are also rather short.  Improvements on building upgrades don't effect the game as much as they probably should.  I've found a few combat bugs that I have exploited to my advantage but they can occasionally ruin a good fight.  Firing on an enemy with artillery during an attack will cause the AI to automatically charge you from across the field.  You can pick off the enemy one by one while never moving your own army to attack.  Takes away from the challenge.  Overall, good game.  Good replay value.  7.5/10			",15,3,0,4,2,0,9

												Amazing game, have been spending a lot of time on it lately.You can fight singleplayer battles, singleplayer campaigns and there are tutorials to get you started off. Then you can start on the multiplayer, a new challenge.The artwork is fantastic, and the in-game experience is amazing. You can have large battles, on land and sea, besieging castles and even play historical events like Waterloo.Away from battles and war, there is a political side of it. You can lower and raise taxes, and even that will have it's consequences. I recommend this game to everyone who loves strategy games with massive battles, cool campaigns and a load of awesome features! :D:			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an interesting game that I believe was created by manlets angry about their height and females making fun of what they the manlets call ""normal size"" to show an alternate history where a frenchy manlet takes over the world, I know, and you know this is BS and would never happen. It is an extremely unlikely situation but it is fun to speculate on what would have happened if the manlets would ever learn, ha.....manlets, when will they learn?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Napoleon is something similar to Empire although a bit worse in my opinion. Battles are better optimized and multiplayer campaign is in there.

												This game has a lot of great ideas and is fun to play if you aproach it with a basic understanding of historical battle tactics. However there are a lot of elements to control all at once and the AI is clunky and unhelpful (surprise) so larger battles can get out of hand quickly. That being said, I still enjoyed it a lot.

												This game represents refinements to gameplay from Empire: Total War.  The map is constrained to Europe only, and it's for the best.  Seasons, attrition, better options in diplomacy find this being my favorite of the TW series.  While it is certainly far from perfect, and not a true simulation of Napoleonic warfare like Histwar: Les Grognards, this game is super enjoyable.  It's best to use either a collection of small mods, or a sweeping overhaul style of mod to make your experience even better.			",19,6,0,6,9,0,7

												Pros: The attention to detail and history of the time period is very well done. The scope seems to be less than some of the other big RTS games, but that will be a plus for people getting their feet wet in the genre. There are a decent amount of variety in the units, and specifically, learning how to use the buffs from the general units is very satisfying. The protectorate system is a nice addition on the surface, but could have been fleshed out more (see below). The minor towns are a nice touch, and since not everything is centralized in the major cities, it makes for some fun times attacking and defending the country side.Cons: A couple of cons, not many, but these two are pretty aggeravting. The AI is horrendous. In my recent playthrough as Russia, I have had to pretty much conquer France and Spain single handly while Prussia and Austria move 2 units around aimlessly. And then I had a French army walk, unattacked mind you, through all of Prussia and Austria, take none of their cities and then attack my lightly defended homeland. Thanks devs. Way to break my emersion. The prectorate system is even worse. I tried to roleplay as the liberater where possible. Don't. Your main allies will just attack them, even before the big enemies are defeated. So count on Prussia to attack one of YOUR prectotrates while YOU are trying to singlehandly finish off Napolean and Spain. And they seem to be less than willing to accept deals. Uh, you owe me your country bud, at least try and be garteful and join a war or two. I'd say that not being able to play as more contries is also a downer, but there are mods for that.

												After putting in over 30 hours into this wonderfully crafted strategy game during the era of the Napoleonic Wars I can say for sure without a doubt that any tactically player or historical player will LOVE this game! Imagine managing any one of the multiple major nations at the time such as Russia or Britain, allowing you to make any decision from controlling your government, trade, industry, research, diplomacy and of course your most important is your military. Now not only are you given objectives to complete within a certain time period but also it gives you the chance for European domination as any one of those major nations. Plan your nation's expansion across Europe allowing you to pick any strategy possible from either destroying large nations to annexing smaller nations into your unstoppable empire! Once you're tired of playing Napoleon's 3 campaigns (Italy, Egypt, and Europe) you can play as any of the coalition nations against Napoleon's France or play multiple different battles that were decisive turning points in history from The Battle of Waterloo to The Battle of the Nile. Finally once you've completed all of that there is multiplayer that is quite entertaining when playing campaigns or battles with friends or anyone else too. Overall this is a pretty good Total War game to buy for you and a friend to play sometime together as a team or as foes.			",49,3,0,6,8,0,16

												Probably one of the best games a person can buy these days! So much stuff to do take over and battle.  The only thing i see wrong is that its only in europe even though i kno it is Napoleons War but id like a bigger campaign map just because it makes the game more fun with Different Factions on other continents why not add Mid East or All of africa it doesnt include north Africa except for Egypt campaign which is a small map.  I like it but the campaign could be a bit bigger...			",79,12,0,11,31,0,50

												Napoleon Total War übertrifft alle seine Vorgänger um längen. Die Neuerungen die bereits bei Empire punkten konnten wurden beibehalten und weitere Neuheiten wurden eingeführt (wie z.B. der Verschleiß oder das ""Befreien"" von Städten), was das Taktieren auf der Kampagnenkarte anspruchsvoller macht. Sehr postiv fällt auch auf, das man die Stärken der verschiedenen Einheiten besser ausbalanciert hat, so das zahlenmäßige überlegenheit nun nicht mehr so viel ausmacht wie in Empire. Dadurch muss beim ""Bau"" der Armee genau überlegt werden welche Einheitenart wie oft vertreten sein sollte. Die zahlreichen Änderungen im Multiplayer eröffnen auch viele neue Möglichkeiten (vor allem die Online-Kampagne) und steigern den Spielspaß ungemein. Was Bugs, Grafikfehler und Abstürze betrifft muss man bei Napoleon glücklicherweise sehr lange suchen oder warten bis man etwas findet. Ein Top Spiel, welches sich ohne weiteres in die erfolgreiche Total War Reihe eingliedern kann.			",79,33,3,22,16,1,33

												Napoleon: Total War is an excellent addition to the Total War ranks. It corrects many of the mistakes made by Empire, while still retaining the Napoleonic grand strategy feel. There are fewer nations, and your world map is almost entirely gone, limited to the more tried and tested method of a European map.Even as a scaled-down version, Napoleon is far more playable than Empire. The game seems far more polished than Empire, with the politics and government branches greatly developed from older titles like the first Rome and Medeival II. Still, the politics, while more intricate, has not detracted from the ultimately military conquest feel of the series, merely added anther effective tool to your arsenal.As a great admirer of the modding community I am pleased to observe that modds exist for Napoleon that enable you to play as any of the minor nations - the vanillia game only enables the larger powers - and even allows you to play as Ireland, which didn't exist as a soverign state at the time.The campaign is excellent, and the option also exists to skip the grand strategy and play Napoleon's most important battles, each unlocking the next until you finally see can you succeed where the 'little corporal' failed and defeat Wellington at Waterloo.I have no hestitation in reccommending this to any Total War fans, and especially those who played 'Empire' and felt that the attempt at grand global strategy took away from the traditional feel. This game is the perfect middle ground between the glory days and the heights that 'Empire' aspired to.			",48,3,0,5,8,0,28

												Napoleon total war is a great game, it has both RTS and Turn Based strategy elements, with the Turn Based portion going on on the overworld map and the RTS portion taking place in all out amazing 19th century battles once you attack something; just on it's own in vanilla it's great but with mods Napoleon Total War is almost a 10/10 for me. As it stands it's one of my favorite games in the Total War series as a whole, it has great atmosphere and has given me some of the best expiriences in gaming. Try as I must there's not allot of bad to say about Napoleon Total War, apart from some historical innacuracies, and the ocassional glitch but that's standard with any game that sets thousands of soldiers against one another in glorious 19th century combat. If you're into RTS games Napoleon Total War is worth the buy, along with it's other companions in the Total War series.			",45,2,0,2,6,0,10

												Napoleon Total war is a decent game, It really feels like an upgrade to Empire but you do not have nearly the scale that Empire had. You are kinda locked into playing Napolians Campaign and I did not like that because they only gave me like 40 turns to complete the missions.I like to play slow, build up and max everything out while I very slowly expand. Then I build massive maxed out army's and crush everything in my path. I loved the Empire Darthmod world domination campaign, it allows up to 500ish turns to win. Napoleon does not allow even a fraction of this. I realize for historical accuracy the way I like to play does not fit well but, I would have much rather had the option to set my own turns per year so I did not feel pressured into expanding until I wanted too. All of that being said this is worth buying just for the great war mod. I think this is the best overhawl mod I have ever seen. The first time I launched a volley from my WW1 arty and litteraly saw 20-30 troops fly through the air and slam into a wall I was all about this mod. Again I wish they would have allowed a longer campaign as I was very rushed.			",20,9,0,25,3,0,23

												This game is a change up for me in terms of genre. To have it simply put this game is what I (if I was a hard RTSer) would want to show other people when Im trying to introduce them to the genre of Real Time Strategy. The setting is beautiful. The battles scenes are glorious. Makes we wish I was born around that time just to admire the style more intimately. The game is decently optimized as well . Ive heard things about the total war games and this game hasnt been the negative stuff that I have heard- which is good. Im pretty late to this series but I also recently bought the atilla and rome 2 total wars because I like this one so much. Ive played a little of those as well and I really like those too. Total war overall is just a great series. TWN would be a great tota war title for newcomers to the series to jump on to. I highly recommend this game especially if yourre into history as well.

												This is certainly my favorite total war game to date.  It features several different campaigns that take from the beginning to the end of the prestigious general's career.  If your computer is capable, the visuals are gorgeous, especially once the combat starts and smoke covers the field and blows in the wind.  The AI is decent for a total war game, and much better than Empire's AI, which could never seem to correctly fight line battles.  I love how tactical the gameplay can get, and this total war emphasizes on positioning and formation to win battles, not just charging everything in sight.  There have been several instances in custom and multiplayer battles when my smaller or less experienced force defeated a much more powerful army simply by being in better formation, and I love that.  I feel like each unit in this game is useful and can succeed when commanded well.  The game itself is crisp and clean and relatively bug free, and local multiplayer games have been a blast.  I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the time period or fans of the total war games, particularly empire due to the simularities.  What I expected to be merely a $15 mod for Empire total war turned out to be a much more polished and enjoyable game all around.			",30,1,0,5,2,0,11

												After the massive and unwieldy campaigns of Empire it was very relieving to play Napoleon. It condences and streamlines the best of the previous Total War, and the close focus on Napoleon works for the games benefit. There are three main campaigns: Italy, Egypt and Europe. Italy and Egypt can be played through in a weekend, rely much on scripts and are likely aimed at new players. Europe is the keystone, and takes many days to finish.Graphics are improved, as are the sounds, and the interface is very clear. The single-player is completed with Campaigns of the Coalition, where the other powers get to try world domination, and scenarios retelling Napoleons famous battles. These battles may be the most rewarding in Vanilla. AI has great difficulties with making balanced armies and then leading them in battles, but the scenarios are built more like interesting puzzles. The multiplayer battles have a cutthroat reputation and there will be challenge there. Campaigns can be played in multiplayer too but that is not practical.Darthmod is absolutely vital, as with all Total War games. The Greek Darth Vader will always get my vote for greatest modder alive. It is a permanent blemish for Creative Assembly that they refused to hire him. Perhaps it was envy, perhaps not, we do not know but should enjoy the fruits of his skill, intellect and passion for completing Total War. Napoleon: Total War is fit for series veterans as well as newcomers and comes highly recommended.			",153,47,0,24,9,1,36

												While Empire: Total War was a grand experiment that took the Total War franchise to an almost bloated scale, Napoleon improves upon its predecessor by cutting down this scale to a much sharper focus. If you loved Empire, you most likely will appreciate the more streamlined approach Napoleon takes to combat and research. For the first time, the weather can also cause attrition to troops. A hightly recommended game for strategy and history fans.Also recommended is the Darthmod, which makes battles much more impressive in scale and adds several other factions with which to play.

												I had avoided this until now due to a belief that it was simply Empire: Total War a few years later. I couldn't have been more wrong. While the basic system (and some windows/messages) are the same, the gameplay feels more realistic and more challenging. In addition to some vitally improved diplomatic options, more detailed region management and troop control, Napoleon: Total War allows an insight to the mindset of Bonaparte throught a rather enjoyable series of campaigns (especially compared to the War of Independance). If you're looking for a game that plays a little like Rome II but with cannons and glorious ships, this is the Total War game for you! I strongly recommend buying it, even for casual play (read as massacre of Frenchmen).			",40,6,1,8,17,0,30

												Napoleon: Total WarPositives:+ Relive key battles from history in the 19th century playing as Napoleon Bonaparte, fighting against the Coalition.+ The campaigns of Napoleon focus specifically on particular geographical locations, like Italy and Egypt. Interesting to play on.+ Real-time battles where you command thousands of soldiers, artillery and cavalry at once. + The Grand campaign map spans Europe, so it's a decent size. However, it's definitely smaller than most Total War games and is therefore less enjoyable.+ Nice diplomacy system.+ DLC packs (The Peninsular campaign) are fun, but be prepared for a challenge.+ Graphics are a step up from the previous title in the series, Empire: Total War and look acceptable, but they're not fantastic by any means.Negatives:- Napoleon: Total War is less complex than its predecessor, Empire: Total War. It's missing a lot of features which would enhance it and seems a bit too simplistic at times. This is an issue which greatly detracts from the potential of the game.Overall Score: 8/10Napoleon Total War offers many gameplay options to players and is downright fun. It could have been a 10/10 like Empire: Total War was, but it falls short. I recommend you grab this at any opportunity when it's not expensive.			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												At this moment I've been on Steam six years, NTW brought me here and is still my favourite, it made me collect all Total War games. The negative reviews you may see are from children who can't appreciate the art and glory of walking into battle; pre-Trump-imminent-end-of-life-wars. Be aware how dangerous donnie-tiny-hands is to everything. The nuckle-dragging evangilists that will not accept science, negative to any progression, and hypocrites in every way ... they have killed this planet. The USA is now an oil company with an army, in your face. Trump is about to start major wars on top of those he has inherited, if you support him please think of changing. Come to NTW, the good old days our ancestors walked in columns into cannons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nahpoleeohn Total War is highly reccomended if you want to recreate the amazing battles of the worlds greatest general. Nahpoleeohn Bonaparte. Get away from the mess of Empire: Total war. Napoleon: Total war fixes most of the bugs, balances the game a lot more. (You can no longer conquer all of France by taking 2 provinces like in Empire, you have to take 8 in Napoleon.) And introduces a lot more units.(In Empire, all the nations have the SAME UNITS exept for a couple that differ for every one.) And theres Updated Textures and Graphics(In Empire, All the *Line infantry* had the exact same texture but mayabe a differant color, In Napoleon, the textures for all units are differant. Napoleon also intruduces: Atrittion , Pulling Generals from army ranks, And  more of a story-campaign. Overall the game looks more professional and more complete than Empire, while introducing features never seen before in Total War.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent game for strategic plans and deep thinking of troop placement to make sure you and your allies win the war or battle it's a game that really takes a lot of mind power to play. There are lots of different types of factions such as the United Kingdom Austria France Prussia Russia Ottoman Empire and moreMy personal favorite favorite faction has to be AustriaOne of the biggest things I really love about the game are the diplomacy options;Meaning you could wage war peace trade and negotiate alliance. You could become the new world superpower.Another key pointer France..... France with the leader Napoleon Bonaparte...when playing his faction or another coalition force like Austria Russia or Prussia(there are lots more factions) you have to conquer the world or liberate from the forces of the mighty French......If you thought this is a good review leave a like if you have any qeustions I'm willing to answer them..""♥♥♥♥ing dope""""@ best game ever""""Dankest shut I've ever played""""You Motha F**ka WITH THE ROCKETS""""Cannons be de dankest♥♥♥♥♥♥♥evevrvrvevrv"" ",28,1,0,4,4,0,5

												Let me tell you of the great Russian general, Sir Mikhail Kutosov. It all begins when the Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire. His force's were immediatly put into action, starting with capturing the 2 towns Moldova and Romaneasca, his great Russian comrades attacked the rest of the Ottoman Empire and together they took all of the Ottoman Empire. After some time, he was deployed in France to fight Napoleon and his forces. After long battles and many casualties, Mikhail took Paris. When Napoleon and his allies were all ""taken care of"" he moved back into Paris to calm down the riots and rebellions of Napoleon's absence. Suddenly, from the north, Das Königreich Preußen declared war on Russia. Those damn Prussians! Who would've expected them to attack! But since Russia owned basically 19/20s of Europe the poor Prussians didn't stand a chance, however during this war he was injured from a stray musket round. He was almost instantly moved back to Moscow and when he was feeling better he was put back into action as Russia's best general, and during the time of Mikhail's injury Russia took England, Sweden, and Denmark. After more city-state battles, there were only 2 countries left in all of Europe.. Russia and their best ally... Austria. Mikhail being the best general had been sent orders to crush Austria and capture Vienna for the good of the Russian empire. However.. on his way over to Vienna, an ambush from a massive army! Mikhail had no chance as his men were shot and cut down. Suddenly in the midst of the already lost battle, a young Hungarian grenzer shot Mikhail Kutosov ending his life. (The ending is made up because Mikhail can never actually be killed in the game) (RIR = Rest in Ruski)RIR 1769~1808 Mikhail KutosovBut for real the game is basically like 9.8/10 in my opinion (I'll be back with a Great War mod version of this) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is basically a stand alone expansion pack for Empire: Total War. It is fun for a while until you realize you are locked into replaying history. In Empires, you can choose from tons of nations, big or small.  In this game, you choose Napoleon and you replay history. If you want to play someone else, you have four choices and 7 years to do whatever you have planned. Since you don't have enough time to customize regions or rebuild armies, it looses strategies I have enjoyed in every other Total War game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best strategic and periodic turn based games around. Although, now relatively old, Napoleon Total War remains one of the most free flowing and eventful instances of the Total War franchise. If you are looking for a strategic game, with multiple maps and various types of battles, then this is the game for you. Taking place during the Napoleonic era, Napoleon Total War brings together single and multiplayer gaming, with each being as much fun as each other. In single player, you have a multitude of options, choose your faction, and begin to build your empire in an environment in which all factions must create trade deals and military alliances to survive and prosper. Or pop over to the 'Play Battle' centre, where you can command troops in some of the more recognisable battles or simply create your own to drill your soldiers and test your own strategic skills.In terms of multiplayer, it’s much of the same. Fight in 1 V 1, 2 V 2 and 3 V 3 battles on either land or see to decimate the armies of the opposition.			",8,0,0,0,4,0,3

												I consider this as one of the best Total War titles to have been released and certainly a dream come true for fans (like myself) of the Napoleonic Period. While its 18th century style predecessor boasted a wider scope in terms of campaign map, in more ways than one Napoleon TW offered a much more refined experience. Creative Assembly carried over all the good things that made Empire work whilst omitting or improving upon any irksome issues. Napoleon: Total War concentrates more on the Emperor's military career. The 'Campaigns' menu allows the player to choose from 'Egyptian', 'Italian', or the longer main 'European' expeditions. Each of these has unique unit styles befitting the period. The Egyptian Campaign would initially prove somewhat easy as the Bedouin faction mostly consists of melee troops - however, the Ottomans are tough nuts to crack, while Great Britain has a powerful naval base and garrison in the area. There is also a time factor; for all three campaigns you must complete victory objectives before a certain date. Historical Battles provide an excellent showcase of the Emperor's famous masterpiece engagements. Finally, it seems this option is now given more serious time and consideration by Creative Assembly; where previous titles only offered five or six, Napoleon: TW is flush with twice that many. Austerlitz, Borodino, Friedland, Waterloo.... It even includes two key naval engagements: Trafalgar and The Nile (despite Napoleon not being present, besides he hardly knew anything about naval warfare).       One improved aspect is the unit modelling: they are superbly detailed and certain factions offer a variety of different types. History fans of the period won't be dissapointed, all the familiar regiments are there alongside the shakoed Fusilier and Foot line infantry, such as Dragoons, Hussars, Highlanders, King's German Legion, Connaught Rangers, Polish Lancers and even the legendary Old Guard. And there's MANY more besides. Access to the more elite regiments requires certain fields of research combined with barrack upgrades to the highest level. Nevertheless, minor nations do suffer from a lack of choice selection thus a player may wish to play as the more prolific, for example, French or British. As before, right-clicking on a unit card displays statistics and historical information concerning that particular regiment. The RTS battles themselves are now much more exciting and fast-paced affairs with an improved AI. Cannon balls leave tell-tale scorch marks whilst powdersmoke adds to the confusing, choking smog of war. Admittedly, sometimes units do still get stuck, while defensive infantry squares aren't quite so effective against cavalry if placed near obstacles - but thankfully neither are common anomalies. Line troops on the march are a magnificent spectacle, even though they don't match pace, while a flautist jollies the (mens' and player's) spirit. This is great, although I would have liked more variation in marching tunes as regards each regiment. And it's a shame they didn't have bagpipes for the Scots regiments. Light infantry lack the pomp of regular line troops, yet clicking on the 'guard' or 'skirmish' order buttons sets off a bugler which adds to the authenticity. Of course, we're never going to attain 'true' perfection of battle experience - and many veterans would consider us foolhardy to desire that - but every detail, small and large, contributes towards a rich experience. Perhaps VR goggles would one day further a player's lust for such an enhanced experience? Having artillery comprise half your army will make short work of fort walls and enemy troops manning the battlements, while any breaches will become bottlenecks guarded by the foe. My advice is have at least one light infantry unit to wear these down from a safe distance. Then, dispatch two or three line infantry to fire several volleys before charging in. Another handy tactic is to attack in this way then suddenly pull back - the hot-headed enemy will then be drawn upon the waiting muskets of two or three other units and catch them in a deadly crossfire. It's a reversal made upon the defenders' position; think about what happened to the Saxons at the battle of Hastings.... However, although sieges aren't at all bad, they could have been better. Certainly, no match when compared against the vast cities and sprawling streets of Medieval 2 and the original Rome. For some reason, such monolithic moments were dropped during development of Empire and Napoleon, almost as if the developers had become bored or even dubious about reintroducing seriously fortified settlements in the age of enlightenment. And it would have been nice to have variation in defences and layout of key cities or even towns. There is always a barracks and armoury, but after a while it seemed too sparse, too generic. In Napoleon, I found seiges something of a chore without the enjoyability nor intense excitement prevalent in Medieval and Rome. Shogun 2 did a little better (not forgetting the Japanese favoured pitched battles and hardly used fortifications in warfare) while Rome 2 faithfully returned to fully fledged fortifications of all types. In Napoleon TW, siege engines such as ladders, battering rams, and mines are abandoned in favour of artillery and troops now automatically equipped with rope grapples to climb the walls. Some towns even lack defences aside from natural barriers and chokepoints - although at least this is true to life. Fortifications are a negative point in Napoleon (and the previous title Empire).              Napoleon: TW's expansion came in the form of the excellent Peninsular War - fans of Sharpe will know and enjoy this theatre of the conflict. It introduces a revised (albeit smaller) reasearch tech tree and some further additional unique units for all four (British, French, Spanish and Portugese) factions. As in reality, the British war effort presented a combined challenge of campaigning with limited funds, strategic maneouvering, and maintaining a careful diplomacy with an unnatural ally. Failure in even one of these could spell disaster for the player's chance at victory. And again, a crucial time factor influences a speedy yet well-planned offensive. Playing as the French means you'll have to maintain authority on a certain number of provinces and hold out until a certain date. Being the Spanish adds a sense of vengeance as you begin to recruit and reinforce Coalition efforts to eject the invader from Spanish shores forever!You're probably familar with all those superb battle scene paintings by Lady Butler, seen countless documentaries on Napoleon, or even possess the film 'Waterloo' from 1971? Well now it's brought further to vivid life where such fans themselves can interact by stepping into the digital boots of Napoleon Bonaparte and marching across Europe to defeat rival nations in a blaze of glory. Certainly, one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Well done, Creative Assembly!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best Total War Series (aside from Shogun 2) all because of the faster loading sequences of the game itself; fast load in the start, fast game loading, smooth gameplay, this game is tailored to be the golden egg. Even though, it didn't focus on other continents other than Europe (not even a North Africa or Middle East setting in this one; Coalition Campaign), it focused a lot of details that happened in the Napoleonic Wars. The different minor factions like the Republic of Veneto (Venice), Italy (not the kingdom of Italy which this Italy shouldn't be here til ~1880ish), Savoy, Ireland, Scotland, Brittany, Catalonia, Westphalia, United Netherlands and Batavian Republic (or Netherlands), Courland, Crimean Khanate, Greece, Hannover, Hessen, Bavaria, Baden-Wuttemberg, Romania, Belgium, Norway, and Poland (I think I named all the possible minor, emerging factions in this game). Its great to see such variety in the gameplay itself. Plus, you can even modify the files for this to your purposes, such as me making a pak file which lets me build Italian Velite Grenadiers (which is a speciality unit) and one of Napoleon's prized unit Grand Artillery and the Old Guard as playing the BRITISH. You can also change attributes of politicans/generals/admirals (name, face portraits, age, etc.) and even replace existing units to have different units (replaced Horatio Nelson's Rose 122 cannon ship to the Santisma Trindad 144 cannon) Sending the Spanish Armada to Davy Jone's Locker in the first turn (all of these are on twcenter.com/forums). Also edited my money so I can pay off nations to get territory without fighting, buying property and encircled my enemies lawl In other words, I play this more and have tendencies of coming back to this game way after I bought this than Shogun 2 (maybe its the lag or lack of campaign replay ability, etc.). Best TW game to replace Empires: Total War			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Napoleon Total War wasn't my favourite Total War game for many reasons. I have now started to play it a lot more than i used because of the Great War mod. The mod just makes the game so much more fun. The only reason i would get this game is so i can get to play the Great War mod.

												When you still play a game from 2010 in 2016, you don't need to write or read positive comments. This game is awesome, Graphics are yet more than decent and the Battles are spectacular. One of my favorites of the Total War Series. If you can find a huge discount for the game and you're  a fan of the Total War saga or strategy games, don't overthink, just buy it. You wont regret.  After 6 years, it  has a 95% of positive votes.			",51,9,1,19,2,1,14

												This game improves upon the falts of Empire Total War, although the latter has a larger campaign map and more nations, Napoleon makes up with quality and depth.If your looking for a Eurocentric capaign with more focus, this game is for you, if you prefer controlling large colonies and more nations, look for Empire Total war.I highly recomend this game and, in my opinion, is a much better game than Empire.9/10			",81,10,0,14,10,0,21

												really enjoy this game and empire total war their is a more vast selection of troops than on fall of the samuri but their is some glitches on here where cannons dont fire or cannon troops run at the enemy instead of fire the cannons other than that great game i really wish they would make a world war one version of it but have the map like empire except you can attack all of the U.S in stead of only half of it and also make it to where the troops either automaticly start in trenches or have the ability to dig them during battle deffintly have a vast selection of artillery and have tanks and light tanks as well maybe even machine guns such as maxium and vickers would be a great game and would most  defintly pre order it or buy it as soon as it came out			",30,1,0,0,11,0,27

												Amazing job, plays with almost no bugs which were mostly ironed out in the Empire TW attempt. The heavy story on one of the greatest historical figures is glorious if not admittedly biased in Napoleon's favor; but I like Napoleon so I'm okay with the French Imperial propaganda. Beatiful graphics, painstaking detail to uniforms, each nation truly feels unique unlike Empire TW. Great music & tonnes of excellent story driven cinematics. I love this game! All Total War games should be like this, CA is usually at their best when they concentrate on a part of history like this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Napoleon: Total War is fundamentally a very enjoying RTS game. I only have two big gripes with Napoleon. The first gripe is that - much like Empire - the textures on units and structures are shockingly low res, even when set to high. Not that it ruins the game, but it's offputting how grainy it can look when zoomed right in. In Shogun, this wasn't as big of an issue. My second gripe is that the offline campaign - which is honestly about the same as that of any other Total War game - focuses strictly on Napoleon Bonaparte's real-world campaign. This shouldn't be a shock, since the game's called ♥♥♥♥ing Napoleon, but it would be AMAZING if this game had the same huge campaign map that Empire did. The time period could have also been a little big bigger - but again, it was to accomodate Bonaparte's epoch, so I get it.I grabbed some DLC for this when they were 0.50$ a piece during the Sega sale, and I really enjoyed the addition of some historical units for all countries. Especially the UK units! Total War has a good example of how to do DLC right - some neat additions that don't make the game better or worse, for a reasonable price. All the DLC does is add some historically accurate units, so really it's just for the sake of eyecandy and to please history buffs.The combat also feels mechanically better than it does in Empire. Not much to say about it, but it feels better. Pretty much all there is to it.9/10, worth the money! Total War never disappoints.			",44,4,0,15,13,0,25

												Love it, Hate it, ntw is arguably better then etw when it comes to quality of the game, and realism. Now the thing that is lacking is the number of nations, and campaign, but for a clan player like myself, this is not much of a gripe since I never mess with campaigns anymore. The clan community of this game, I'm rather new to it, and don't know much about it, as I use to be prominant in etw's clan community, not this game. I guess in general, the players you'll find on here are more skilled overall, but also less trustworthy in my oppinion. I only have one real friend in it's community right now, and i'm admin to one of the most elite clans to the game, so I guess I'm not doing to bad. Overall though, this game just shows you what etw SHOULD have been like......imagine all those factions and each one being as unique as they are in ntw, and the realistic battle mechanics.......ETW2 will make, or break the success of the total war franchise......don't screw this up like rome 2 CA.

												This game combines the massive campaigns we've come to expect from the series with improvements from Empire: Total War.PRO:  It adds slowly regenerating units in friendly territory, that's so useful.CON:  It does suffer the classic problem of the series, the need for massive victories.  You can not allow the AI to resolve battles, it always leads to heavy losses.  Worse, in many campaigns, you simply can not lose a major battle, and you must win almost every fight as a blowout, to have a chance at achieving the goals.			",703,192,22,116,97,7,223

												""Death is nothing; but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily.""So the ""Corsican Ogre"" said. If the title didn't make it completely obvious, this game focuses on ""The Little Corporal"" and all the fun things he did from 1796 to 1815. Frankly I see this as a missed opportunity. Sure, Bonaparte is interesting and is perfectly capable of holding up a game by himself with how many military campaigns he did in his life, but this just as well could have been a game about the whole of the French Revolutionary period (back to 1789) and gotten more out of it. It is worth exploring the fact that Revolutionary France was already powerful and winning a war against almost all of Europe before Napoleon ever began his Italian campaign. If you played any Total War game, and particularly Empire, you know what you are getting: Battles with dummy AI and a strategic map against an AI that is fond of stacking huge armies at the capital and leaving them there until you go kill them. The gameplay is almost identical to Empire's, but with more polish, a tighter focus, a horde of unique units all dressed up in the proper uniforms of the era, and a special series of campaigns. Basically there are two seperate campaigns here. There's the Coalition one which is basically like the typical grand campaign of the other Total War games, and then there's the Napoleon stuff that is much like the Road to Independence in Empire, but of a much better quality. There are also lots of historical battles, and unlike alot of Total War games these ones are actually quite good. Most of the big ones of Napoleon's career: Lodi, Austerlitz, Borodino, Waterloo, and more are all here. There are a few important ones missing (Marengo, Leipzig), and you get two naval battles played as the French where, historically, the British absolutely trashed the French fleets (Aboukir Bay/Nile and Trafalgar). Trafalgar in particular is irritating, because you would think it would let you play as the British since it is probably Britain's most famous naval victory in history. Missed opportunity for a small and cheap Nelson DLC I think. They did make a free DLC where you can play as the British at Waterloo, which makes this Trafalgar omission all the more annoying. Oh well. On a positive note the historical battles are heavily scripted which, while making them predictable, also makes them pretty much just like they were historically. Nerds like me appreciate such things.This game doesn't have the same large scale that other Total War games have, and that will annoy some. Ultimately, this game is for those interested in the Napoleonic Era. If you are such a person, then this game is a treat. Its AI problems are annoying, but they are no worse than other Total War games. I got alot of playtime out of this, and maybe you can too. :3			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												This game is brilliant, I love it!!I give it a 6 out of 10 though, this is because in the Peninsular Campaign expansion Portugal is not playable and it should be since Portugal was the reason Napoleon invaded the Iberian peninsula!Reason 2: The Campaigns of the Coalition. Why not have a normal Grand Campaign like Empire did? You can only be 4 major nations which are Russia, Prussia, Great Britain and Austria in Napoleon Total War, why not have nations playable such as Spain, Sweden, and the Kingdom of Italy, also you have to unlock France by completing the story mode 'Napoleons Campaigns' which is fine because it makes you work to control the French Empire as Napoleon did. 6 out of 10 I suggest you buy it as the multiplayer battles are excellent, the graphics are beautiful in all senses and it still boasts a large community of online players at all times of the day and the week!GOD SAVE THE KING!

												The game is very satisfying .The campaign is fairly good but it's real bright is in the multiplayer battle's(the AI sucks). It demands more strategic thinking than other total war games .Constantly moving troops to get the bestbest fire angles, using the environment to get tactical advantages, each nation has it's cons and pros (Netherlands only cons  )And battles get pretty epic whit 4vs4 and howitzer volleys blasting all over.

												This is a pretty good game. It is basically Empire Total War with a few changes. It runs and plays well. I like the soundtrack in this game.There are not as many small kingdoms as in Empire Total War. Battles tend to be large. Both of these things can be positive although I like having many smaller kingdoms on the map. Of course a long Empire Total War game has fwe remaining kingdoms late in the game and most are rather large.This is an excellent time peroid for warfare. Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry are all useful on the battlefield. There are many cool units during this time period.There are off map trading sites similar to those found in Empire. These trading sites are nice for extra income.Napoleon Total War is one of the good Total War games. Total War games are great. I like them. I need to spend more time with Napoleon but am hooked on Empire for now.  ",34,3,1,4,7,1,16

												awesome game ever  people if you want to download the great war mod do not because it mucks up the game i suggest to stick with the original but the game is superior. The best campaign is the napoleon one you have dozens of units to play with they are also have the best morale in the game. Guys i totally reccomend the game if you want more experience i suggest getting the expansion packs or downloading empire total war. The game is not that good with multiplayer but other than that it is the best pc game ever. Hope this review is good and you all love the game Bye all s_watts8			",10,1,0,1,5,0,4

												Napoleon was done brilliantly.The land battles are a major upgrade from Empire. That I could coordinate my line, light, and grenadier units and position them in accordance to the terrain as opposed see that they have guns was nice. Oh, and Horse Artillery units are a blast when they zip all over the battlefield. In comparison, Empire felt like an add-on to the end of Medieval II when you start mass-producing gun units. With Napoleon, I felt like my understanding of battle tacics was actually important and being tested as opposed to simply trying to outnumber my opponents.The naval battles at least ran smoother, a bonus for me since I like the novelty of them early on. A lot of my friends say it's just another thing to autoresolve, but I like finally having the ability to coordinate my outnumbered and outgunned fleets into capturing massive enemy vessels.There aren't nearly as many options in the campaign, but I'll live with that. I played the Great Britain and Prussia campaign's and neither was overly disappointing. One of the things I didn't like about Prussia though is that you should have the power to join the Coalition or ally with Napoleon, but the game steers you against France the entire time. C'est la vie.Now, Napoleon's mini-campaigns and the like were where the real brilliance of the game shows itself. You play through his conquests of Italy and then Egypt much in the style of Medieval II's Kingdoms expansion, where it's only in one theatre of Europe itself. Egypt got surprisingly tough early on; I had to settle for wiping out the Mamelukes instead of taking only what I need in order to get the Bedouin raiders to leave me alone, and I never did take the deserts from them. After those, you go to the traditional map for taking on Europe as a whole. It was difficult, but not impossible, and I enjoyed my series of battles with Wellington.However, the best part is the very end. After that, you need to play the battle of Waterloo. I sat down, cracked my knuckles, and thought long and hard about what I should do. I know my history and why Napoleon failed, as well as his opening moves that carried into his defeat. I tried 300 different strategies. I set it on easy. I lured Wellington into the plain and smashed him to pieces in time for the Prussians to attack me from behind. I waited for the Prussians to arrive and wiped them out first. Every different move I could make, I made it. And I lost. Every. Single. Time.The game is about Napoleon, about one man and how in both victory and defeat he changed the course of history, and it grants you the power to be him. It wasn't until I lost for the 300th time at Waterloo when I released something; I was thinking the way he did. The game and my past victories conditioned me into believing that not only was a better general than Wellington (and a computer-generated one at that), but that my knowledge of Napoleon's own defeat meant I wouldn't make his mistake. And in doing so, I walked right into his greatest failing, being blinded by my pride and thinking I would win. I've never had a game deliver that specific brand of experience before, and it was incredible. Props to The Creative Assembly for that.Overall, I give it a 9.8/10. My only complaint is that certain generals like Napoleon and Wellington are unkillable in the campaigns. I get that it's supposed to emulate history more than any other of the series, but I'd have liked to be able to change the details. It's one thing to send Napoleon packing back to Paris, it's annoying to have to fight him for every single inch every turn or so.Also, I had no internet access at the time of playing this, so don't be decieved by my hours of game time.I hope that in the near future I can get the Peninsular Campaign and other add-ons to continue the experience.

												Napoleon Total War is definetly a great strategy-game. It shows the history in a quite interesting way which is fascinating a player for many hours. Total War-games in general are a great mix of turn-based and real-time-strategy.In no other game the battles are so impressive like the ones in NTW are, when thousends of soldiers march and fight on a realistic and varied battlefield.The only large problem is the multiplayer-bug with the ""host do not responding""-error which many players, including me do have.But Nevertheless it's a great game.

Instead of conquering these nations France decides to not be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and setup trade agreements with them--Even when there last city was Paris and Strasbourg(Austrians in this game are ♥♥♥♥ing useless, and spend all there time fighting over Munich, which is litteraly conquered once a month by either Austria, France, Prussia, or by rebels annoyed by the fact that foreigners once a month) this trend continues untill Vienna falls in the late game , Russia tries to push back but nobody gets back at Napoleon, who seems perfectly happy to be surrounded by his enemies puppet states (which I use to land troops on French soil whenever I want to)10/10 would troll France again			",43,4,0,8,15,0,9

I disliked the building on the campaign map and the seasonal changes. I disliked the set up of some/most forts. I disliked alot about this game, but since I hate the combat, which defiens a Total War game, I walked into this pessimistic.

												Napoleon: Total War is fundamentally a very enjoying RTS game. I only have two big gripes with Napoleon. The first gripe is that - much like Empire - the textures on units and structures are shockingly low res, even when set to high. Not that it ruins the game, but it's offputting how grainy it can look when zoomed right in. In Shogun, this wasn't as big of an issue. My second gripe is that the offline campaign - which is honestly about the same as that of any other Total War game - focuses strictly on Napoleon Bonaparte's real-world campaign. This shouldn't be a shock, since the game's called ♥♥♥♥ing Napoleon, but it would be AMAZING if this game had the same huge campaign map that Empire did. The time period could have also been a little big bigger - but again, it was to accomodate Bonaparte's epoch, so I get it.I grabbed some DLC for this when they were 0.50$ a piece during the Sega sale, and I really enjoyed the addition of some historical units for all countries. Especially the UK units! Total War has a good example of how to do DLC right - some neat additions that don't make the game better or worse, for a reasonable price. All the DLC does is add some historically accurate units, so really it's just for the sake of eyecandy and to please history buffs.The combat also feels mechanically better than it does in Empire. Not much to say about it, but it feels better. Pretty much all there is to it.9/10, worth the money! Total War never disappoints.			",44,4,0,15,13,0,25

												Napoleon: Total War is easily the most divisive of all Total War games. Some folks love it, some folks hate it. It is, to be fair, an almost carbon copy of Empire at first glance. The most noticeable difference is that Napoleon concentrates exclusively on Europe whereas Empire allows the player to conquer the globe. Beyond first blush, Napoleon does feature some improvements over Empire that make it worth consideration. Chief of those is better coding - Napoleon is accepted by most to be a much more stable and better running game than Empire. It is also better looking. AI is supposedly markedly better, however that is debatable. There are a number of mods available that greatly improve the Napoleonic experience - but you're fine running the stock game.If Empire and Napoleon look too similar to you - if muskets and dragoons are all the same to you, you may prefer Empire over Napoleon due to the globe. But... If, like me, you have a fascination with the Napoleonic Wars, you owe it to yourself to give Napoleon: Total War - beyond dominating Europe, there is also a series of historical battles and campaigns that are very enjoyable.

												BEST TOTAL WAR EVER in my opinion. Being British it makes you feel incredibly patriotic ! ;DThe unit detail is fantastic and the sea battles are just brilliant. Took me a year to complete the total domination of Europe from Britain as I was just casually playing. Most of my hours are just spent doing custom battles as those are most fun. A quick tip just spam  howitzers are the best by far. Only critism is that the infantry done line fire like in Empire which is a bit odd as its a newer game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the Total War series, and this is no exception to that love. I'm a huge history buff and without a question my favorite period of history is the Napoleonic Era and this game was such a step up from the last one. The units feel smoother, the game seems more optimized, and for the most part, it is historically accurate. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the Total War series, the Napoleonic Era, or people looking for a solid RTS.			",189,40,1,23,29,2,53

												This game is absolutely epic. The only disappointment was that many of its features were not patched into ETW and that there are no India or America theaters. However, that does not detract majorly from the overall experience. You can liberate countries and create puppet states, play a multiplayer campaign, and much more. Buy it.			",102,21,2,13,8,1,14

												Love it, Hate it, ntw is arguably better then etw when it comes to quality of the game, and realism. Now the thing that is lacking is the number of nations, and campaign, but for a clan player like myself, this is not much of a gripe since I never mess with campaigns anymore. The clan community of this game, I'm rather new to it, and don't know much about it, as I use to be prominant in etw's clan community, not this game. I guess in general, the players you'll find on here are more skilled overall, but also less trustworthy in my oppinion. I only have one real friend in it's community right now, and i'm admin to one of the most elite clans to the game, so I guess I'm not doing to bad. Overall though, this game just shows you what etw SHOULD have been like......imagine all those factions and each one being as unique as they are in ntw, and the realistic battle mechanics.......ETW2 will make, or break the success of the total war franchise......don't screw this up like rome 2 CA.

												This game combines the massive campaigns we've come to expect from the series with improvements from Empire: Total War.PRO:  It adds slowly regenerating units in friendly territory, that's so useful.CON:  It does suffer the classic problem of the series, the need for massive victories.  You can not allow the AI to resolve battles, it always leads to heavy losses.  Worse, in many campaigns, you simply can not lose a major battle, and you must win almost every fight as a blowout, to have a chance at achieving the goals.			",703,192,22,116,97,7,223

												I really liked Napoleon Total War.  It is one of my favorite total war games, along with Shogun 2.Things I liked: I like the individual city based approach as opposed to the newer 3 cities in a province approach.I'm a fan of the Napoleonic era, and have played many strategic boardgames set in this timeframe.   This game has a similar feel to Empires in Arms, and other strategic Napoleon era games.I like the cav vs. artillery, infantry vs. cav, artillery vs. infantry matchups.AI for all computer games is somewhat suspect.  This AI is ok on defense, but lacking on offense.  For best results, the player should be on offense and the computer AI on defense.The objectives and victory conditions are good.Technology tree is ok, but nothing special.I've played several campaigns: Egypt, Italian, and Grand Campaign (1805-1812, both Napoleon or an allied power (UK, Russian, etc.).  My preference is the grand campaign because of diplomacy, trade, technology, etc., but the other campaigns are also pretty good. ",5,1,0,8,1,0,8

												Another great addition to the Total War series. As per usual, we have the slightly bad AI system, but it has improved from the previous games, correct me if I'm wrong. This game is awesome, however can get slightly boring if you play without mods, it lacks range of units, but that is due to its setting, there wasn't much during the Napoleonic Era of History. Though still a great game to be playing, I love playing as the British, conquering the seas, blowing up French ships sky high, it is truly an epic experience.I highly recommend installing mods such as Darthmod when playing this, it adds a huge range of units and improves the game a lot, makes it much more fun basically. There are also other great mods out there, so you don't just have to play with Darthmod, go knock yourself out with the other mods, they're all fantastic additions to the game.Highly recommend this.

												I think that Napoloen Total War is a GREAT game I love the new inprovements from Empire Total War EX: when you capture a city you can chose to raid it or with out robbing or harming citzens.From my point of view Napoloen Total War is the best Total War in the series.

												BEST TOTAL WAR EVER in my opinion. Being British it makes you feel incredibly patriotic ! ;DThe unit detail is fantastic and the sea battles are just brilliant. Took me a year to complete the total domination of Europe from Britain as I was just casually playing. Most of my hours are just spent doing custom battles as those are most fun. A quick tip just spam  howitzers are the best by far. Only critism is that the infantry done line fire like in Empire which is a bit odd as its a newer game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the Total War series, and this is no exception to that love. I'm a huge history buff and without a question my favorite period of history is the Napoleonic Era and this game was such a step up from the last one. The units feel smoother, the game seems more optimized, and for the most part, it is historically accurate. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the Total War series, the Napoleonic Era, or people looking for a solid RTS.			",189,40,1,23,29,2,53

												Napoleon Bonaparte, arguably Histories Greatest Military Mind of All time, Lead His Armies Tearing through Italy, Egypt, and Later, Brought Europe to its knees, Until Eventually, A Coalition of the United Kingdom, Russia, Sweden, Austria and Eventually Prussia Finally Defeated him at Liepzig and Waterloo. This Game has been a All time Favorite for me, as it was Essentially Empire, But with Much better Battle Gameplay and variety. The Two Side Campaigns for Napoleon Are well made and were a good challenge if you like being under the pressure of time. In Europe, The Fact that you get missions alot more than in empire where you only get one mission as Spain Britain and France. if you buy this game, you should also try getting Darthmod, as it makes Nations a Little more balanced and it allows you to Campaign as any Faction on the European Map.

												Gutted to be thumbing down this game. Its a phenomenal RTS game, the first of the total war franchise that I've played and I've heard it's one of the best. I love the era, I love the story, I love that you have the power to make 160 men stand in a line to shoot and get shot against 1000 if you want. What I do not love, is the community.About 40 hours of my time has been sunk into the first 3 campaign's of Napoleon, the rest are online. The first 30 hours-ish of online were superb, friendly people ready to decimate each other's armies with grand batteries or unicorns (haha). Anything after that has unfortunately, for the most part atleast, been an utter waste of time, due to ""ah nah m8 u ent gt 5 starz so u ent pleyin bruh"", or the ""lets play lets play lets play....... OH EM GEE i sed no ARTILLERIIE"" .... or finally, and the WORST of all....... ""host has left the game"", which happens as soon as they realise you have the upper hand. weird people in the world say gaming is a waste of time, a lot of the community in this game help prove that point. If you like to be winning a strategy game which you've given thought to for it to suddenly end because they can't hack losing, purchase away. Otherwise enjoy the campaign and the story it brings, for a brief spell.			",40,3,1,8,2,0,6

												If you liked Shogun 2...dont ever try this game...it has a bad campaign map with very small army markes and so on...I uninstalled it after giving it 1h...a bit harsh I guess...but it wasnt worth the time even if the battle themselfs are fun... Get shogun2 in stead.- Update -I recommend you to buy it and get the mod ""NTW3"" it makes it an awesome wholesome realistic feel of the battles, slower paced and gives a deeper tactical feel for it, check videos on youtube.

												A tighter more focussed effort than Empire that introduces some nice features. Unfortunately to me this feels like it should have been an Add-On for Empire in the same way FOTS was to Shogun 2. In any case its a great Total war game that just feels a little lacking in scope. A much more tactical campaign this time around. 8.5/10			",280,32,2,25,26,0,48

												This is probally one of the most interesting Total War games. Even tho its quite old, it still packs a punch. It offers 3 different campaigns, which aren't as big as the one big map in Empire, but offers more detail and better combat. The vanilla is great if you don't like mods, all tho the only factions you get to play is a bit on the lame side. As i stated earlier, the combat is better, the AI seems more aggressive and doesn't just suicide, all tho in some cases its pretty stupid. It's good, but the best thing about this game is the campaign and the lack of factions hurts. You can ofc install mods to improve the experience but I don't think I should mention this in the review.			",15,0,0,0,5,0,5

												Napoleon vs Empire:Battles - NapoleonIf you compare the battles, Napoleon wins hands down, the polishness of the battles is great and a loooooot better than empires, the sound effects are simply amazing, and the smoke effects and the fire effect are jaw breaking. Even if you download Darthmod for Empire, it cannot beat Napoleons polishness and amazing battle effects.Camapign - TieI am giving this a tie BUT ONLY BECAUSE EMPIRE HAS EUROPE,NORTH AMERICA AND INDIA TO PLAY IN, THATS IT. Napoleon has only Europe but as I said for the Battles section, the polishness is so much better, and I HAVE NO LAG WHATS SO EVER IN NAPOLEONS CAMAPAIGN MAP AND I RUN IT ON MEDIUM - HIGH SETTINS, Empire is so buggy and hands down, buggiest game in the Total War franchise that I lag on the campaign map on the lowest settings (And no its not pc, ITS THE GAME, I run Napoleon on Medium - High settings, Rome 2 and Attila on Medium and I HAVE NO LAG!)AI (Artificial Intelligence) - NapoleonBoth games AI are not perfect or great, but Napoleon has improved its AI slightly but the less backstabs and the more Geopolitical gameplay unlike Empire...Winner - NapoleonNapoleon is simply waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than the buggy mess Empire is, Dont get me wrong, Empire is enjoyable to play, but you will want to put your head in a bucket of lava when you experience the bugs on the battlefield that will cost you the battle! So Napoleon is hands down the Winner AND I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU GUYS BUY THE GAME! It will be worth the money! :D-Thanks!			",54,5,0,1,2,0,12

												Napoleon Total War, a great game. It reminds me of Realism, and the hardingship of war. Now Napoleon may be hated because its lack of more explore of other Theatres of War. It'd would of been great if they added More Regions to the World like the map on Empire's Europe but more detailed with more Regions. Also the war did take place in India too. So that'd be great as well. But by far. Napoleon Shows you the realism of war. Which makes it hard. Like Great Britain's Campaign, You have Gilibratar And you must defend it from the Hostile-Agressive Spanish. But you can also get Portugal to join in the war if you through acouple of thousends of Shillings in Portugals Face, If you know what I mean, Ya you know what I mean. But Napoleon by far has a great Battle Features, That should of been in Empire. All though Napoleon Total War doesn't nearly show the Factions of Empire. But thats no Problem. Download Darthmod. A great mod Which gives you lots of abillites. Which Napoleon Should of Had. But Again, if you can't download mods Then Still play the game, Its still great! ==========Naval Combat==========    Ok, from 2010. Empire introduced a New Feature to the Total War Series, ""Naval Combat"" Which before it was basicly of a Auto battle. But now its brought to full Feature. Napoleon Brings the realism of Naval Warfare. Which Many new Featrues but alot are old but still clean. Napoleon does also have a Graphic Advancement. So if your a person with no taste in Bad quallity again Napoleon Is your game.  Also. The Battles make you feel like your a Admiral or a General. Leading and deciding were to attack. Every little move you do make effect a problem or a salution to a couple turns in the future. So Be careful. Picking fights with abunch of Countries could lead to Bank rupting on Military upkeep, Or parishing under another Leader's Flag.=========Land Battles=========  Now Have you always wanted to be leading a Siege or a attack on a Open Field. Now Empire/Napoleon Is your game. On Napoleon a whole new and better Engine is used. Which allows you to easier finding of troops and eaiser to see instead of have a big box blocking 1/4 of your Screen. Now With Epic Sounds you can hear the Crackle of a VOlley, You can hear the Drum and Flutes of a Regiment. Makes you feel of so realism it over flows. This is the First time a Total War game follows a Person not a Time of History. But it does take place of the whole Napoleonic Wars, Though Really Napoleonic Total War sounds  abit weird. So Napoleon Total Fits. ",33,1,1,0,4,0,7

												Napoleon is one of the best Total War games out there. For me it is 2nd only to Rome 1. it takes the vast progress made in Empire and refines it without the buggy gameplay seen in Empire. The Delightful textures and very individual styles for each nation brings it back to life most wonderfully. For any person who loves total war or likes all things napoleon it is a must buy in fact you should already have it!			",109,7,2,13,21,3,30

												This game could be so much better. I am going to point out one thing, and that is the horrible logic behind the ranking system. I had a lot of ranking points, and I was playing and almost always winning competitive games. And then all of a sudden when my game crashed, I lost 1000 points, and that is 1/39 of all I had. And the first fighting had not even started! It had taken me ca 10 games to aquire these points, 10 hours of concentrated strategy. The higher ranking you got, the harder it is to get a lot of points. So be warned, those who participate in Ranked matches - this game's ranking system is NOT kind.			",6,0,0,1,3,0,9

												I don't think Napoleon is as bad as some people say. It's a marked improvement over Empire and is incredibly fun, so long as you use DarthMod or TGW. Its pretty fun (if you use either of those mods) and has become my 4th most played game on Steam mainly because i enjoy the time period and style of warfare. Marching in a line towards, most likely, your death, the sound of artillery pounding in the distance all set to a lovely tune on drums and flutes. It took true bravery to do that.

												A great complement to Empire, with it's more focused campaigns, and I can think of no better way to learn of Napoleon's military career than by commanding him in each of his campaign. Each theatre of war is worth playing, and aren't nearly as time consuming as Empire. The Peninsular Campaign is absolutely stunning and covers one of the darker periods in Western Europe's history. 9/10 The gameplay and interface does not feel different at all, but it's basically the same thing CA did with Atilla and Rome 2. I don't like paying full price for what feels like a major DLC, but the quality makes it worth it I guess.			",64,3,0,4,8,0,20

This game requires strategy and the campaign us fun unless you go bankrupt...Once you start making income etc,. man this is a game you will want to put hours into, Sometimes the game will troll you but other then that it is great, Once you add Darthmod and get the most realistic battles possible then you absolutely love this game,if you are a History and a strategy type of person then this game is for you 8/10			",28,1,0,4,0,0,2

												This game could be so much better. I am going to point out one thing, and that is the horrible logic behind the ranking system. I had a lot of ranking points, and I was playing and almost always winning competitive games. And then all of a sudden when my game crashed, I lost 1000 points, and that is 1/39 of all I had. And the first fighting had not even started! It had taken me ca 10 games to aquire these points, 10 hours of concentrated strategy. The higher ranking you got, the harder it is to get a lot of points. So be warned, those who participate in Ranked matches - this game's ranking system is NOT kind.			",6,0,0,1,3,0,9

												For me, I think Napoleon: Total war was an amazing improvement to Empire: Total war, new ways of warfare were introduced in this time from 1792-1815.  So much has come out of this game that has effected each and every other game in from the day this was released and on in the series.  You'll experience Napoleon's glory's, know the effects of the attrition in winter, and feel your enimies fright when you march your army onward, even though they have 5,000 men of Mumeluke's.  Even to this day, the multiplayer is up and running, and the community of total war works hard to bring you the best mods.  Everything I love is in this game, from war to diplomacy, you'll be an Emperor once you buy Napoleon total war.Invaded France and won in 1805    Blew Napoleon up with a 7lbs Howitzer          10/10 ",73,5,1,6,25,0,30

												Standalone expansion to TW: Empire, TW:N is much smaller in scale but still a very interesting release. It's quite similar to TW:E in many ways, but with a much smaller map, centered on Europe with focus on Napoleon, obv.  With mods installed, it definitely enhances the experience. DarthMod (not perfect but overall a very good mod) largely increases the unit sizes and overall scales up the rts warfare. It's main issue, just like with most TW titles (especially TW:E) is the glitchy AI. This can get quite frustrating. Also annoying is the auto-resolve option, which is just completely broken and can easily be abused (by both you and AI).TW:N is not as good as TW:E but it's still good, and definitely worth getting if you're a TW fan.  Skip the DLCs though (The Peninsular Campaign is ok I suppose)			",367,38,12,38,20,2,71

												This game is awesome. I got it a week ago, and it's hard to believe it's 6 years old! Everything looks great and plays smooth.I really love Naploeon's personal campaigns, the voice actor they chose did a great job.I suggest Darthmod for slighly more realistic sound and visual effects with some better AI and extended campaign possibilites.If you're a napoleonic era enthusiast, this one is a no brainer. If you're a video game fan and want a new game with some really awesome battles and fun campaigns then you definitely need to check this one out, you won't be disappointed!This is my first TW and it's begun a new era of series dedication in my life.

												4/5 ""Fantastic"" **** Graphically wonderful, and well programmed. Good sound design, but mods do improve the over all experience. Faction balance is a bit of an issue, but skilled players will be able to compromise. I would have liked to see more balance with the cavalry. Not the best title to play a tournament game, but still highly entertaining. Oh yes and they fixed the artillery, its now one of the most powerful and useful units in the game.

												I had fun with Napoleon: Total War. It has graphic and AI improvements since Empire: Total War. This is the 2nd Strategy game I had played, and had a blast playing the Coalition campaign as Britain. I conquered the French Coast, fighting for Gibraltrar and having to deal with economics and other duties. My first priority was research and money, so I could get a big and strong army, as well as a navy. Then I moved inward, conquering the smaller countries and the weaker ones. I made allies.Then I downloaded the Darthmod. It made the game look 5x Better, and it added the smoke effect. It was really imersive. If your looking for a backup Strategy game, then buy this!9.4/10!

												The game is essentially Empire without the crippling bugs and more tasty unit variety. Where in Empire, most of the mainstay European faction units were painfully generic, thankfully there's much more unit types and looks now. The main campaign is a close knit and somewhat scripted affair, it doesn't detract from the experience, as you are retracing Napoleon's footsteps. If that doesn;t strike your fancy, there's also Campaignsof the Coalition in which it is more open ended but still on a smaller map than empire, plotting Napoleon's downfall. It's not entirely historically accurate, an inevitability in such a game like this. However, it tries its best to stick to period authentic tactics and effects. The battle effects are very lovely to look at although the Warscape engine is starting to show cracks what with wonky animation sync and sound clipping as well as some atrocious balance in some engagements. However, it works and is a decent engine for representing Napoleonic combat. I am a bit biased as I am a monumental Napoleonic and 18th century history enthusiast and if you have a love of history or total war or any other strategy 4x title, I recommend this game highly. Tl;DR thank god it isn't Rome II.			",75,3,0,6,9,1,38

												Take part in the greatest battles the world has ever seen!  This is a great game!  From an avid history fan and a fan of the Total War series... who would not want to partake in ""The Age of Sail?""  The naval battles are unrivaled in this game!This game limits you from global domination as the map did in Empire Total War; but essentially a continuation of Empire Total War with a more polished look.  Battle the AI and conquer all of Europe.. re-writing history as Napoleon crushes every European power of that time period... or take on mighty France as the Brits, Russians, Prussians or Austrians from Napoleon's reign of terror!  Napoleon Total War offers a nice single player campaign mode; or a multiplayer aspect where you can take your skills as a general to fight along allies and crush your enemies on an array of battlefields.  Game has replayability and is historically accurate!  Easily one of the best real-time strategy games ever made!  I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves this time period or is a fan of war games!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its the same engine as Empire, but has better graphics, runs smoother, and has better terrain. Pros: GraphicsStableWeek by Week GameplayCons: Only Europe to play onNo Grand Game like in the previous entriesLimited choice of countriesThe game is broken down into smaller campaigns and you have 2 Short Napolean Campaign and 1 Europe Wide Napolean Campaign, but for the coalliation you have a europe campaign, choice of your country from the coaltitionAs with Empire, the building mechanics are dumbed down from Medievel 2 and Rome TWFocused on Gunpowder Units but has Dragoons and Horse Mounted Infantry with GunsHas a couple of Ships to choose from but in the smaller campaigns, naval power is irrevlevant.I personally would have prefered it if it went longer and maybe spread to the war of 1812 but on smaller campaigns it only lasts half a year and you have to option to continue.The Italy Campaign for France: It is you vs Austria and Piedmont.Take Piedmonts capital and their yours (though i would take it last so i can have the most land possible and it bankrupts them) They will horde all of their units near and in their Capital City so you will need a lot of troops. Take Austria and Clear a path to their Capital (It doesnt go to their capital, it goes to the Eastern Point of Italy and all you have to do it over whelm their cities with men and they will go with out a fightTake the northern part its you slugging away while late game and everyone is taking attrition and losing a portion of their men to snow and desertion, its the same as the rest of austria ",56,6,0,15,21,0,11

												In short NTW's singleplayer is in everyway inferior to ETW's and all the new features they added to the campagin are pretty usless as the lines have already been drawn (refering to the new dipomacy options) and looting settlements is pointless along with liberating them just for them not to help you.Multiplayer Battles: This one is a bit iffy. Yes NTW's community is much larger however the reason being is that ETW's community was ruined by competative cod type trash players and they have all moved on to this, ETW had light dragoons spams where line infantry were there to soak bullets, the lights to break the stalmate and the extremly op light dragoons do all the fighting, Here it is dominated by infantry spams, just like ETW better light infantry wins, thats it. That aside the community is riddled with rage quiters and people who rig the rules in their favor. The biggest issue is the balance, instead of the factions having strengths and weaknesses like ETW and other TW games is bascially France>UK>Prussia>Russia>Austria> everyone else, yes there is still skill involved but some factions are extremly unbalanced and factions like the dutch stand no chance.

												Finally caved and bought this one despite it looking like a stand-alone expansion to Empire.  Autoresolved my way through Napolean's first campaign so far.  So far it looks just like Empire, with a much smaller map, shorter campaign, and mega-overpowered autoresolve.  On hard difficulty it was near-impossible to take less casualties than autoresolve.  Actually fighting the battles though, I must say, after many, many hours on Rome 2, it was incredibly refreshing to not have battles take less than 5 minutes.  Personally I'd stick with Empire, though, if you enjoy this era of warfare.  Unless you are really after the history of Napolean.			",37,4,0,14,15,0,22

												Hey people, My NTW audio isn't working at the moment and I thibk it may be due to the fact that I installed a mod called 'ACW North & South'. Now, I have sinced removed this mod as it bored me however the sound on NTW has stopped for no apparent reason. The sound for the Sega and Napoleon intro still work bu then silence. Also before people tell me the usual way I don't have the 'Creative Assembly' folder on my PC so the only way I can access NTW is by doing the following; This PC - Local Disk (C:) - Users - Fierce PC - Steam - SteamApps - common - Napoleon Total War. And so I don't know what to do, so please any help would be great! :D			",66,1,0,2,10,0,18

												Honestly the only thing that Napoleon beats empire at is graphics. Theres maybe 6 countries to play as and nations like sweden have a whole 12 units to choose from. 4 infantry, 4 cav, and 4 art. And its pretty much the same for every nation unless you want to spend another 15 dollars on all the dlc. Even after I spent 5$ on them i still have very little variety.. Theres about 8 maps. This game should have really been an expansion for empire instead of an entire new game.. the campaigns are average and multiplayer can be exciting at times if you have as much money as possible because everything is so expensive, you probably wont get more thant 10-12 units. As stated earlier theres only about 8 maps and most are borrowed from empire.. Grassy flat, the desert one, only a few are of any decency. Like dresden and that only if more than 2 people are playing. I really liked the Total War series but I feel like they have pulled a Call of Duty on its players with releasing this title.

												Fun until you find the bugs, the AI is stupid as f**k if you set up cannons on the hill you would of thought they will try and go round nope they will run in and die, the game crashes every 10 minutes and the advice voice repeats itself. the game wont remeber that you turned off help so it will keep turning itself on. And the naval battle is a joke you tell your ships to fire at the bad guys they ship will face at them shooting the front cannons not the 32 on the right or left the ships cant decide what to do as will sometimes just chase the bad guys around the map DONT BUY THIS GAME, GO GET SHOTGUN 2 TOTAL WAR INSTEAD!

												Napoleon was a skillless♥♥♥♥♥and thus a game built around his character can't be good.This is basically a less ambitious version of Empire: Total War including less playable factions, less units, less buildings - name anything.The gameplay is, as you might suggest, equal to ETW but what bothers me is that nearly the entire interface is exactly the same as in ETW. The graphics did by no means advance either.The only mentionable ""innovation"" it features compared to ETW are the 4 comprehensive campaigns of Napoleon which would be fun to play if you didn't have to use French units.This again leads us to Napoleon being a ragged and megalomaniac French general who had to conquer significant parts of Europe in order to compensate for his lack of height.But you can play as Prussia and the other coalition powers. And you can experience how it must've felt for the real Europe when the Prussian General von Blücher and Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington crushed the revolutionary French forces at Waterloo.11/10 would shed tears of joy again.

												This review is difficult, as I don't not recommend it, nor do I recommend actually buying it either...In its own right, not a bad game...But don't bother if you own Empire. Its more or less a carbon copy, but with, for some reason, a worse interface.I have to say, Empire:Total War is the superior game to me, I finished the campaign and was left feeling ""Is that IT?"" whereas with Empire I feel like Ive a lot left to do, even thought I've played it for longer.At times, it feels like a straight downgrade from Empire, with a smaller Tech Tree and a sole focus on Europe (rather than India or the Americas, as Empire had).EDIT: Ignore hours played, I usually play offline.

												I do not like this game at all which is a shame because I love the time period. It is dissapointing in almost all aspects: Campaign, Historical Accuracy, Replayability, and Base Game content. Some people do complain about the small scale of 4,000 soldier battles compared to the real historical counter part of 80,000 plus soldiers because th at is simply do to technological limitations. Also the multiplayer is alot of fun. However things like Grenadiers actually throwing grenades is laughable. I simply cannot reccomend this game to anybody and I much prefer Empire with all its bugs to this. If you are looking for 19th century combat total war Fall of the Samurai is MUCH better than this. May not be napoleonic but looks, sounds, and plays much better than napoleon total war.			",36,2,0,2,13,0,18

												I cannot think of anything positive to say of this experience. I hated all of it. The auto-complete doesn't work with logic. The time required to even get into battle is boring. The overall experience left me uninstalling, twice. The achievement progression is weak and I have no reason to install this or my other TW collection again.			",674,170,29,114,120,3,131

												If you love the Contemporary period but hate Empire, buy this game. It largely fixes the vast majority of the bugs that were introduced in Empire Total War.

												Despite what anyone says about NTW, it is a very good game. Matter of fact, it competes for one of the best Total Wars in my opinon.NTW setting is in Europe, during the Napoleonic Wars. Sadly, it is strictly only Europe, which makes the campaign lack variety, even North Africa, or Turkey would be nice. Anyway, The main factions are, France, Britain, Austria, Russia, and Prussia. All of these factions have advantages and dis-advantages, which I will get onto later.The actual Gameplay in NTW is outstanding, with the traditional TW engine, mixed with Muskets, and Line formation warfare, makes for hours upon hours on entertainment, not to mention the Campaigns, and multiplayer.But, my favorite aspect of NTW is the multiplayer battles, more then any aspect.I have hours upon hours with my friends, fighting Public players, as we used outstanding teamwork, when outmatched and numbered, It is just a blast, I do not know how to explain the Multiplayer in a review.I would go more into the gameplay, but there is Youtube Videos, and screen shots for that.Anyway, I would rate Napoleon: Total War an 8/10. Has some under-whelming bugs, but is still a masterpeice, and other games could learn a thing or two on NTW.			",63,2,0,2,10,0,19

												If you're already into the Total War series then you already know what to expect; this game continues from the Total War Empire and is focused on the Napoleonic Wars. The campaign would have you control Napoleon's Army from his lowly beginning, to his conquest of Europe and Africa, and until the showdown in Waterloo. The campaign alone would take you several hours (or days or months) to finish as you have your army crush everything in your path with muskets, bayonets and cannons. They have also added units that is unique to that era which could give your army an edge in the real-time battles. Overall this is a good strategy game and is highly recommended for any armchair general and history buffs!			",546,125,25,87,68,6,121

												This game is very good. As a rabid fan of Empire, it was nice to play a version of Empire that focused on the Napoleonic Wars. The greater focus unfortuately comes at the expense of Empire's expansiveness. You only get a European (with some Middle East and North Africa) map. Although it is more detailed than Empire's European map, the game leaves out all the other theaters in Empire, which is unfortunate because the Napoleonic Wars were a global conflict. That said, Napoleon is a much more manageable experience that will likely run better on your PC then Empire did. The combat also is a shade better then Empire's as they clearly ironed out some of the bugs and optimized the system for Napoleon. If you liked Empire, buy Napoleon. But if you have played neither of them, I would recommend getting Empire if you get only one. You are getting a much more expansive game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As much as I want to recommend this game, it just isn't as worth it as it is for Empire, Medieval II and the other Total War games, and I will explain why.Firstly, the theatre of war.Sadly, this game is LOCKED to the European theatre of war. I mean, yeah, it's Napoleonic Wars, not like it happened in South America, but it would've been interesting to have, oh, I don't know, NORTH AFRICA? MORE OTTOMAN LANDS? Seriously, it isn't that hard, CA.Secondly, the lack of diversity.I mean, sure, it's 19th century warfare. Line infantry, light infantry, horsemen, all that♥♥♥♥♥♥ But it would've been nice if there were atleast some diversity. I mean, a faction like France or the Ottoman Empire will be very diverse as they are very unique, but you didn't have to copy paste faction units to factions YOU CANT EVEN PLAY ON CAMPAIGN without NTF, which brings us to the third factor.Thirdly, you can only play as Austria, Great Britain, Prussia and Russia early game(excluding Napoleon's campaigns which are actually okay)? WHAT? WHY? Why can't I play as the Ottomans? Why can't I play as Sweden? I mean, I like the emergent factions thing. That's awesome. But, why only 4 factions?Now don't get me wrong, there are a lot of awesome features in this game which makes me want to give this a great review so badly, but I just don't want to lie with myself. Sorry.In conclusion, this game deserves a 5.4/10 personally. Slightly above average.tl;dr - Just get Empire and download Darthmod. It fixes the AI and adds a lot of awesome shiz. Have a nice day.

												Another Gaius Julius Ceasar reviewBefore i lost my original steam account and deleted the email attached because it was always spamming my email with mailer demon, resulted in me losing my only way to regain my old steam account this game and shogun 2 were the only steam games i had.However though this is not a 100% like, it is more a 57% like, the game has great things to say but at the same time it also has it's downfalls. Lets start with the upsides first. The game is very good for it's diplomacy, it seperates the minor factions from the major and allows for regions to be swaped, unlike in Rome II, state gifts can be given and trade embargos can be broken via diplomacy. This allows for a really great political feel that i believe is missing a bit in ROME II.The factions are powerfull and most off them are allies, this allows for much more ease of mind, knowing that you will not be facing a war on all fronts. The graphics is good, it has a great campaign graphics.Now for some of the downfalls: As I mentioned above the graphics are good, great campaign graphics but terrible battle graphics, this is a major downfall because you need to get up close and wait a few seconds before you can see the soldiers as normal instead of a weird blurred shape thing. Also as mentioned before, in the coalition ( which for me is the whole campaign ) you are allied with nearly every country that bonaparte is not in control of. This can be good for an ease of mind but also makes it annouyingly difficult to expand at all, because if you are playing as say Austria then you cannot invade RUSSIA, PRUSSIA, this prevents great expansion, the only true places Austria can invade is the ottoman empire or the italian steas, and France. And with France on one side and wanting to invade you you cannot finish of the war you start of with against the ottoman empire, causing you to struggle on a two fronted war. ( end of downsides )However so the game is still a great game that i can tolerate, however so some might not think the same, my only advice is to read as many reviews as possible and make your choice that way. Yours sincerlyGaius Julius Ceasar			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is absolutley a must for RTS fans. I don't mainly play RTS games, but this game and Empire Total War got me interested. I have a lot of fun on the Siege battles, and figuring out different ways of defending my fort. This game has pretty good graphics for a RTS and I enjoy playing on multiplayer every now and again. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												- Load game up. - Play as the glorious United Kingdom.- Upgrade mines, roads, cities etc.- French navy start testing Nelson's fleet.- Dominate the French navy and destroy them with ease.- Spanish navy approaches. - Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥- But then on the horizon another British fleet that has been reinforced arrives.- Suddenly brimming with confidence.- Spanish attack.- Reinforced navy backs up Nelson.- Am fighting a glorious battle.- Realise I'm losing and e reinforcements haven't arrived.- Spanish ships destroy most of my ships. - Start retreating. - Reinforcements arrive just in time.- We attack Nelson's flagship the HMS Victory engages the behemoth Santissama Trinidad.- Santissama Trinidad nearly boards the Victory.- Suddenly a 100-gun ship-of-the-line pulls up beside the Trinidad.- Victory and ship-of-the-line fire broadsides on either side at point blank range.- Trinidad is disabled and sunk.- Now I focus my fleet on the remaining Spanish ships.- I destroy them all.- Another glorious victory for the British. - Nelson is my most trusted admiral.- I rule the seas.- Build 1 unit of line infantry in London. - Go bankrupt.- Rebellion captures three cities and destroys me.10/10 would fall by employing soldiers again.But seriously this is a great game although the AI is not the best to put it politely and is very easy to defeat, and the diplomacy is a bit on the bad side. All else here is good, although most problems are fixed by Darthmod which makes diplomacy and enemy Ai behave like real people and makes the battles intense and challenging by adding realism and making them behave like a general would at the time. This is why I always use it when I play. But even without Darthmod it is a good game and is very fun when playing against a skilled opponent online.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's well made and despite lacking a viable sandbox version of Grand Campaign. (You have limited options, more fun I suppose in a game regarding superpowers. It'd suck to start as a smaller nation, despite that being what I'm ranting about it not having. It's a good game, the campaign is fun, and at the end you get to control one of the best empires in the world, except perhaps Nazi Germany, the Mongols definitely beat these♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on objectives. Well, hell It's a good game, perhaps not a great buy if you are looking for MP, it's dead. DEAAAAD. Used to be a few 1ship games going around, a hell of a lot of NO ROCKETS AND MAX 3 SKIRMS. Games. Good fun, but Rome is probably a better buy unless you are going for Darthmod. Makes things so much more interesting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6.

												The Total war series has had its high points and (regrettably) its low points. Even more regrettably, Napoleon Total war is one of them. Whilst it is a fantastic insight into Napoleon’s career and has a much sharper feel than Empire, it feels too much like an Expansion to be considered a proper standalone game and is the weakest addition to the Total war series.Napoleon Total War is different to previous games in that instead of one clear ‘let’s go out and conquer the world’ campaign; the game is broken down into several miniature ones, each from a key part of Bonaparte’s career; Italy, Egypt, Spain, Europe, etc. In most of them, you start with an army at one end of the map and are tasked with basically matching the achievements of the Emperor himself. The usual Total war rules apply. This would have been perfect, if this was an expansion to Empire, yet it isn’t. Instead the campaigns are too short for you to get stuck into them as you would a Grand Campaign in any other Total war, yet at the same time too long for a fast paced, dynamic expansion. They take up the awkward middle ground between the two and soon become boring and repetitive.You can also play as one of the members of the various coalitions opposing Napoleon; Britain, Austria, Prussia or Russia. Therein lies another problem; too little playable factions over too small an area. As the only other factions that can do you any serious harm are small in number and right beside you from the word go, it feels like a short campaign in Rome, say. In fact it takes about as long to complete. I suppose this could be to allow you to understand how all these fast paced triumphs from Italy to Belgium were all part of one man’s extraordinary career, but it doesn’t feel like it. This is really annoying, as I believe Napoleon would have made a superb expansion to Empire. And whether you like it or not, the warscape engine is here to stay.It pains me to have to say this, because there are some very nice touches. The historical battles are sublime and a perfect addition to a game that centres on Napoleon. I always thought the historical battles in Empire felt swept under the carpet and Napoleon Total war more than makes up for it. They encompass Napoleon’s entire career (just about) from the early days at Lodi (1796), to the mud and chaos of Waterloo (1815) Each one is narrated and explained with a welcome back-story of the events leading up to it. They prove to be just as entertaining as the campaigns (and just as annoying) as you struggle and swear over trying to unlock each one.So whilst we are meant to consider Napoleon a standalone game I honestly can’t see it that way. For those who express an interest in the Total war series I would direct them towards Rome 1 or Shogun 2 and recommend Napoleon only for the die-hard fans of the series. If you have to get it, at least try and get it when it’s on sale!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Please treat with caution before you purchase this game. If you need an epic musket line battle simulator then this game is spot on. The battle aspect of the game has very epic battle scenes and astonishingly satisfying graphics. The naval battles are also really enjoyable to watch with top-tier ship of the line models. However, eye candy as it is, the player might spend the majority of their battle keeping the general alive and tweaking formations. SInce there is no chain of command, the game is pretty demanding for the player as he has to micro each line as well as the whole battle. Simiarly in naval battles, the player is offered an interface more suitable to command each ship, instead of a fleet. The grand strategy aspect of the campaign has little synergy with the battle part, and is flawed in various ways. The player cannot make any significant decisions like when to start a war and make an ally, but are given timed mission to capture certain places. Decisions the player made, like teching and build infrastructures, hardly make any differences. The game also didn't represent Napoleon well. In this game Napoleon seems nothing more than a power-hungary prick eager for land. If you want to learn more about Napoleon, this is not the place to go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Low production quality aside, I can't see why Napoleon was ever produced at all. It adds absolutely nothing on top of Empire. The battle mechanics and units are identical (except for the names) to Empire, while the campaign offers LESS than an Empire campaign. You are given a small map and a few objectives that need to be completed with a very short deadline. There's no strategy, you just march in a straight line.The TW series doesn't always get it right, but they usually try to add. Here, they trimmed down an existing title, for the sole purpose of telling a particular narrative. It is clear that the devs saw an opportunity to work a great general into the franchise, but had no real vision on what the actual game should look like. Unless you have a particular affection for Napoleon Bonaparte, my recommendation is that you skip this repackaging and play the full game instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I see what they were *trying* to do with some of the battle mechanics, this may be the worst of the total war games.  The lack of an open, free form campaign is a major hit against them.   The positively odd ability to completely surround an enemy every time you ambush them, regardless of circumstances, is an interesting choice, but is in itself gloriously unrealistic and turns a game of careful strategy into ""run at the other guy as fast as you can"" pretty repetitively.  That being said, if you've never played any of the total war games and get this one on sale, it's probably worth it.  If you eat, breath and sleep Total War, this is a kinda fun set of mini-campaigns to add to the list.  ""Worst of the Total War games"" is a pretty mild insult, as it truly is an excellent series.  I just recomend if you only buy one Total War, (or two or three for that matter), this probably need not be one of them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a copypaste of Empire Total War. With the exception that it lacks many content and the whole grand campaign scenario. Now you have mini-campaigns instead.

												Think twice before buying.  Cheating is really bad on here but it is a wonderful game when played with the right people but finding good games is hard to do.  A lot of ""five star"" players violate rules so you stop game which is defeat for you.  There are also some bugs that people use to cheat, horse art, etc. It sucks because you spend time learning to play a game and for every epic battle you have 10 filled cheats/noobs/hardcare campers.    I think if you are going to spend the time to learn a game, look elsewhere because the cheating just straight out ruins the game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a good game, but really it's just a dumbed down remaster of Empire: Total War. A few graphics improvements with the addition of Co-Op campaign, yet they don't have America and the native tribes. It's also quite clear that they hardly tried to make their maps. You have open fields with a fort in the middle, or maybe a town. In Empire there was diverstiy to the maps. A fort on a large bluff with cannons on all sides, and it made you put in some actual thought as to how you were going to get up there. A huge valley with a native village nestled inside, with plenty of spots for their archers to ambush you. Meanwhile in Napoleon, you basically have to fire artillery until you break a hole in the wall, and then send all of your infantry to march into the fort. And that happens every single time.Also, you can't see the scouring sticks. Why can't you see the scouring sticks?? WHY??			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An utter and complete disappointment. Napoleon TW just like Empire TW did not offer any new ideas or real improvements compared to its predecessors. I liked both Rome and Medieval II a lot better. Napoleon feels like very much like a scenario DLC for Empire TW, which I also did not really enjoy that much. Somehow Napoleon manages to actually oversimplify important aspects of the game and unnecessarily complicate requiring some tedious and annoying micro management. I will keep playing Medieval 2 instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So five years after its release and its still buggy as all hell. Could be good if it was not for migraine inducing sound bugs, regular crashes to desktop, very very odd unit bugs (like sometime the battle won't end because there is a enemy unit that has no banner, can't be attacked and will not move. Joy!) and my favorite thing of them all: when sometimes a country decides to split there armies up into individual units for no reason other then to make their turn take forever and any battles with them a long line of single units slowly getting killed.I would give it a thumbs up if it was not for the fact that when you look up possible fixes for these bugs you only get ""what bugs?"", ""its common sense this will be fixed first patch"" (dated 5 years ago) or a list of bugs and no fixes. At this point the game is expensive abandon ware, and that is sad as it clearly would have been a good total war game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hate this game. I want my TW games to be grand in scope and playing the life of one man kinda ruins that. This scope for a TW game is just not my thing. Also it's basically Empire TW with slightly more modern units but with hardly any depth. I don't like it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was over-priced at 30$.  It's basically a re-hash of Empire with different maps.  As with that game the AI armies are incredibly stupid and you win battles you really should have lost.  But the thing I most dislike about the game is that campaigns are heavily scripted.  You keep being given missions to attack neighbors before you even have a proper economy established.  You're told what specific attacks you are to make, what province to conquer next, etc.  I haven't played multi-player.  But playing the campaign against the AI pretty much stinks.  It's too easy and the campaigns are too short.  I want to enjoy the game with out being on a strict schedule or being pigeon-holed into a strategy that's not of my design.  An annoying factor is that even if I manually shut down AI verbal advice, those annoying British-accented voices keep returning.  I'll say to myself, damn, I shut that off.  Also, even when you opt out of watching the mindless CPU moves, the AI will make you watch some of them anyways.  So you see your opponents and others marching their Gentlemen and moving their ships around all over the place for absolutely no reason.   Seeing some of these things tipped me off early that just like Empire, this game was going to have bugs.  Like freezing late in a campaign.  I'm going back to play Rome.  Where you build your empire by your own hand.  Medieval Total War 2 is so much better than this game.  If you've never played a Total War game start with MTW2.  It's awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The AI is rubbish and there are many bugs like- The AI will start moving somewhere than keep stopping- When you click to attack the unit will go somewhere else- It randomly crashes-The lag effects the orders and the unit may not move or attack when you want it to-Some of the horses will go on an endless loop of trying to go out one fort entrance and then another-The units/horses/cannons will all die in the same poseJust to name a few but it has very good graphics and game play and being able to go anywhere in the battle field is good.The the pros outweight the cons just, but Napoleon Total War needs massive improvement especially to the AI			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rockets are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in pvp, they get endless volleys which hit directly on their targets, over hills where you couldnt possibly see them.. the result is either your general or any other artillery or your cavalry just get annihilated.. it forces you into melee rushes or just to stack the most rockets yourself. Napoleon wasnt known for spamming rockets, what a frustrating game destroying mechanic.Single player, the series has always been great.. but the multiplayer is pure garbage because of this blunder. Rockets are supposed to be incredibly innacurate..This went from a ""hidden gem"" review into very mad about a single mechanic very quickly I might add... its just a huge mistake on the developers part, the rest of the gameplay is great.I have 45h right now and that will probably be increased many times over, yea its worth the price on sale (I play SP a lot) but there are better TW's out there for online because of this mechanic, most people play this stuff for online thus the non reccomendation.

												A more polished and Europe only Total War game thats alot like Empire Total War. It's better in every way though and would make a great edition to a Francophiles collection or and RTS/RTT/History buffs.18th Century I think is one of the worse,best, and most interesting times in history but the combat,line battles, is something I really enjoy.

												In all honesty, I expected a step up from Empire, new units, more tech advances, unique campaign that allows you to either follow history or stray from it. What I got Better graphics, less units, less playable nations, smaller total map, removale of the Americas and India, confusing tech tree (at least for me), akward unit commanding, paying at least $5 to get more units, near complete copy paste of Empire, just increasing the graphics and removing alot of units and capabilities. Is the game fun, sure if you to be near forced to follow history, enjoy playing as France, because Great Britain, Sweden, Russia are near castrated. If you want a good TW game I suggest Empire or Rome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a lot of fun with this game, and though it had some nice new features for the time, I still enjoy Empire Total War more. More than likely that is because of the scope of the map and tech in Empire as opposed to this: Napoleon is much more focused on Europe alone and as a result has a more detailed map, but of course that is because it covers a smaller area. It's hard to justify playing this when you can either play Empire for the experience of this era in a grander scale or Shogun 2 when you want a more detailed and fleshed-out, feature rich gameplay.

												Don't waste your time with this one, the artificial intelligence is ridiculous.  The battle simulator allows the AI units to exceed unit capabilities such as using formations that are not available to the player (moving infantry in a skirmish cloud, refusing its line and firing in multiple directions), sustaining 75 - 90% casualties without routing (units ought to rout after 20-30%), artillery shooting through its own units with no friendly fire damage but will use your artillery to kill your men unless you control every aim point.  It's kinf of like the AI doesn't like losing and cheats to gain an advantage.  Allowing the AI to autoresolve battles is even worse, the player almost never wins even with clear material superiority, if you do win the attrition is so high your army is useless afterwards.  On a strategic level the AI is also rigging the game, allowing pissant countries that have inadequate funding to field multiple armies it can't afford.  The AI will cause friendly or neutral countries to declare war for no apparent reason.  If you conquer a country and a rebellion occurs you wind up facing two or three whole armies of top line troops, just an absurdity.  The game has potential but the idiot designers have made this AI function in a ridiculous fashion rendering the game experience maddening.  If the game used superior strategy and tactics to present a challenge to the player that would be fine, but giving itself unfair advantages because it controls everything makes the game experience unrealistic.Don't waste your money on this one.

												When it was first released, Napoleon was being charged for at full price ($60 US)... when it has no place being charged at full price. It was released a bit under a year after Empire: Total War and plays almost exactly the same. In effect, it's a standalone expansion for Empire that Creative Assembly and SEGA tried to pass off as ""the next major Total War game."" It certainly has a number of technical improvements over Empire that make it not run anywhere near as badly, as well as some additional features, but I have issues recommending the game.The lack of content compared to Empire is the chief issue I have. It seems at first like there might be quite a bit, as there are 4 campaigns to start with. Two of these are based on the actual historical events of Napoleon's Italian campaign and the French invasion of Egypt during the era. The other two are the French ""mastery of Europe"" campaign and the Campaigns of the Coalition, which are basically the grand campaign limited to France and the Coalition in a campaign to defeat Napoleon's France, respectively. All four of these campaigns feel incredibly limiting compared to what we're used to from the previous Total War games. There are eight playable factions, compared to the 11 that were in Empire, and a few of those factions are only playable in certain campaigns (ie. Portugal and Spain are only playable in the Peninsular campaign). Each faction does have its own units, but they feel pretty much the same across the board due to the nature of warfare during the Napoleonic era. They attempt to supplement the game's shortcomings in variety with a lot of DLC that makes the game seem more like a cash grab than anything else. Like I mentioned before there are some improvements over Empire. The AI is slightly better than it was in Empire (which isn't saying much... the AI in Empire was pretty stupid), but it's a pretty negligible degree that you really only notice if you played a lot of Empire. It runs quite a bit better (probably in no small part due to the lessened amount of content), they improved the battle simulations a bit, and they tossed in some additional multiplayer features like the multiplayer campaign. So that's nice to have, of course. The only real problem with that is CA never really sorted out the netcode all the way with their engine so issues that popped up in Napoleon still persist even in subsequent games.I could go on about how I personally find the warfare of Empire and Napoleon to be rather dull (line infantry squaring off under artillery barrages with cavalry charges to break up the monotony seems cool the first few times you do it... then you realize that's how every... single... battle goes... it wears thin incredibly quickly), but that's just me. I'm well aware there are plenty of people out there who find that incredibly interesting. If you liked Empire, you'll probably be able to get something out of Napoleon. Had CA & SEGA released it as an outright expansion to Empire rather than a full sequel (ie. a ""Napoleonic Campaigns"" DLC), I feel like it would've been better as a whole. As it stands, we have a full standalone product that is basically a stripped down version of Empire with some slight improvements in certain areas, and I just can't recommend it based on that.

												Ugg... this is just a shameful game, that really hurt a great game series. First off this game has the error of basing itself around one mans life. You progress in these pointless story chapter of Napoleon's life, starting in his childhood, then his first battles in Italy, then he becomes Empeor of France blah blah blah. Personaly, I do not have a problem wiht Napoleon though. There is a grand campagin aside from these chapters. There are ONLY FIVE, YES ONLY FIVE PLAYBLE FRACTIONS. France, UK, Prussia, Russia, and Austria. That is all. THE MAP IS ALSO CONFINED ONLY TO EUROPE. THAT IS RIGHT, ONLY EUROPE. THERE IS THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE, BUT THEY ARE VERY INSIGNAFANT IN THE GAME, and it only has it's provinces in Europe. I should also add they are not playable. So to sum it up, this game is fousced around one man's life, and pretty Euro-centric. Get M&B Warband NW DLC. That is a great multiplayer game in the Napoleon's wars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Empire total war gets bad press for being buggy, though from my experiences that's basically all fixed now except for the occasionnal CTD if you alt-tab too much, but this game deserves a reputation for being buggy and just lacking content. i can think of no reason other than an over-fondness for the specific time period to get this game over empire. the research tree is lacking many things from empire, for example fire by rank is gone but fire and advance is not- meaning if you have your units in a defensive line ready to take on the world, you must either abandon your position and advance into your enemy, or sit there like a chump with no real advantage past getting the first volley off.Maybe when this game was new the reduced functionality made it more stable than empire, but having played both for a reasonable length of time i can say that empire is quite simply the better use of your money.

												This game stinks. It's unresponsive. The units never do what you order them to do. The generals are weak as heck and die as soon as they are exposed to battle. The cavalry does nothing but run around enemy units, doing almost nothing. The fighting animations are useless. The guys just fall down around each other. The artillery can't hit the broad side of a barn. When it does make direct contact, it barely damages the enemy unit. However, the enemy cannons are always on target and do immense damage. Napoleon was supposed to be one of the greatest artillery captains in history, but his artillery can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥All in all, this game is a waste of time. If you want to play with muskets, rifles, etc. get Empire Total War. Do no even spend $3 on this crappy title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was looking forward to the single player mode and wanted to do a battle as they came up in the campaign . I had Rome Tw and all the others up to Medieval 2 .  I guess the magic of the TW product is gone for me .  My game $ was refunded in full . TY Steam , I guess my download was a bit scrambled .

 THIS GAME IS IS A LET DOWN  Combat is not at all fun, units are hard to control, which get easier to learn after playing for a while. Campaign was dissappointment. They seems to be not as much strategy as the other total wae games i have tried.Tutorial was confusing and doesn't help much.  the hud is small and confusing.  Maybe i may have to play more of this game to learn strategy, but this game doesn't have as much of the fun component as the other total war games (which i suck at, but non the less fun). Don't recommend this game.			",23,2,0,4,3,0,7

												I recently started playing this again after pretty long break, but the game is now unplayable laughable trash ! ... TW have obviously had an influx of people who think they know what they doing ... they don't ... they have killed this game for me personally. This is NOT the game I bought originally, it has been kiddiefied to an unnacceptable level and I would like my original game back now please, not this trash. Until they sack the incompetants I would avoid this game completely.I had intended buying some newer TW titles but this enbarrassing mess has cost them money now.I would like Steam to re-instate the game I originally bought, this is NOT it, then I can switch off auto updates.

What moron came up with that design choice? It completely breaks the game. I can bankrupt map-spanning empires using a single small boat. I beat the game without even using an army for most of it, I had a small fleet and just kept bankrupting France over and over, then getting them to surrender France to me for money, one province at a time. If this is a bug, it hasn't been fixed. I really REALLY hope it's a bug, because otherwise there was no playtesting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding cheese cake recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients: 1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs3 tablespoons sugar3 tablespoons melted butter40 ounces softened cream cheese1 cup sugar3 tablespoons flour1 tablespoon vanilla1 cup sour cream4 eggsDirections:For The base:.If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375.Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on.Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter.For the batter:.Make sure everything is at room temperature.Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight.Release the sides of the springform.Eat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was a waste of time from the get go. Let's see, well first off they've shortened the factions to FOUR, FOUR BLOODY FACTIONS!!! To put that too scale this game has Prussia, England, Russia, and Austria vs. Empire Total War when you had the choice of the Ottomans, the Spanish, the ones in Napoleon, Poland Lithuania, and so much more (especially with the minor factions mod). Then they threw in ""Napoleons Campaigns"" to replace ""The Road to Independance Campaign"" from Empire and it is nowhere near as good, while ""The Road to Independance"" tells the intresting and heartfelt story of America and it's a real challenge with a new setting, while ""Napoleons Campaigns"" is just forcing you to play France in a diffrent way. I don't know about you but I never liked being told what to do in Total War Games (except RTW with the Senate) and this game basically takes away all that free though. The game spans are short too! The longest one you can get is 1805 - 1815 vs. Empire's 1700 - 1799. Oh and the Battles, the battles... if you try to launch a battle on any of the maps you have about a 75% chance of your game freezing up and crashing, even on the BEAST of a computer I run this game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ The Portraits are♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game is just♥♥♥♥♥♥in General and I have to look REALLY HARD to find anything good about this game, and the best I could maybe say is that the battles are kind of sort of like Empire, but not really....0/1*Really recommend Empire: TW  BTW*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												napoleon in nappies!im waiting for someone to make a mod where all the soldiers are wearing a nappy.fun fact: wellington boots were named after wellington because he invented them as an all terrain comfortable boot.fun fact 2: the nappy (or diaper as they say in america) was invented by napoleon because he's elite guard would rather soil themselves than leave their post & job of protecting their emporer to poo and wee, so napoleon invented the nappy, a bit of cloth that they can poo or wee into on the go.anyway, untill we see some historically accurate dipiction of a frech soldier in a nappy im giving this game a thumbs down.

												Of the Total War series, I've played Shogun 2 and Empire. Of those three, this is the weakest installment.It is a clone of Empire with some changes. Those changes don't affect the core gameplay. I would be fine with the game if was essentially an expansion pack, but there are so many glitches, some which can cost you a battle. Let me name a few:-units will stop responding. In one instance, I had an enemy cavalry regiment bearing down on an artillery group. I ordered the artillery to fire stop firing at enemy infantry and target the cavalry. The artillery stopped firing. They weren't reloading, they weren't doing anything, they just stopped. This happens so often with horse artillery (the really fast artillery pieces) I don't even use them.-Units will sometimes do the opposite of what I tell them. On a number of occasions, I ordered an infantry regiment to charge an enemy. The regiment was at full strength, yet it started running the opposite direction for no reason. I kept ordering it to attack the enemy but this did nothing. The regiment had not broken or shattered, it just ran away for no reason.-ordering grenadiers to throw grenades rarely works-a wall was about to be destroyed on my fort so I ordered my regiment to the center of the fort. While it was in the middle of the fort, everyone in that regiment dropped dead the second the wall was destroyed even though they were no where near the wall. This frequently happens.If you can look past the glitches, you'll like the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Total War series is tagged under the genre “strategy”. I would use this term very loosely when it comes to the Total War franchise. The idea of two armies battling it out to the death sounds pretty awesome, the issue here is that Total War simulates this in a very boring, unrealistic and unfair manner.About half of my playtime is in the campaign, and the rest I’ve put into online battles. Both of these game modes aren’t really up to scratch since they miss many features which would make the game more enjoyable.In the online edition of the game, there is no progression system (although there is a technology tree in the single player campaign), which means that you’ve got nothing to work towards whilst playing the game online. This means that the online gameplay gets very boring, very quickly.Another reason why the online is quite poor is because of the way the “strategy” in this game works. The only strategy in this game consists of spamming the most over-powered units and running to the top of the largest hill as quickly as you can. I have many hundreds of hours in this game, and I’ve yet to win a single battle. This shows how un-balanced the game is; it also shows the lack of strategy involved in the game (I’ve played many hours so I’ve had plenty of time to get good, yet I still can’t win any battles).If you want a game which requires strategic thinking, I recommend that you go and check out Call of Duty. Call of Duty is a game which requires a lot of strategy and teamwork if you want to beat the opposing team. You’ll need good communication with your teammates, as well as good knowledge of the maps and guns. There is also a progression system, so you actually have something to work towards whilst playing the game.I’ve also reviewed other games which claim to be strategic, such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (many claim it’s a “strategic shooter”) and I’ve explained why games such as Call of Duty are better. I will leave a video on this below the review.

												It's ridden with bugs, some of them game breaking, with next to no support or customer service.If you're into historical authenticity or indeed, authenticity of any kind, look elsewhere.This is a cash grab that has no excuse not to be an expansion to Empire: Total War, many of the assets of which still appear in-game and the bugs of which are for the most part shared.Don't support this dev team if you can help it.

												Meh. It's another Total War game. They're all pretty much the same. And if they're not, they're similar enough that I can't tell the difference. I feel like they just keep releasing new campaign packs for the same old game.Okay, to be fair I think we're up to about the third generation of the TW game engine. But Medieval and Rome are basically the same game. Empire and Napoleon are the same game. I haven't played Rome 2 yet, but I bet it's the same as Shogun 2.If you've played TW before, here's more of it. If you haven't, don't start here. Start with Medieval or Rome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Two mods with the exact same infuriating game-breaking unplayable bug? Uninstalled Great War mod.Downloaded a standalone Ai tweak for vanilla NTW. my troops.. of a constitutional monarhcy.. shouting ""revolutionary guard!"" wtf is going on here? That's 3 mods.Came to the conclusion that it's not the mods that are♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's the game. I guess CA is trying to put the point across that they don't want people modding or enjoying their games any more or they'll punish us by deliberately breaking the game to the point of unplayable for doing so.game's unplayable vanilla because of crap ai, weak sound FX and balancing issues. usually CA is happy to leave it to the modding community to fix their games they've always been fine with it in the past; seems they were determined not to let that happen in NTW though. even with mods its unplayable because of the stupid voice bugs CA has boobytrapped it with.i'll be more careful before buying another CA game again that's for sure, if a game isn't allowed to be modded then I lose interest sorry			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can not express how good this game is. When I say that a game was one of the best that i played it is very rare and this game is in my list. Napoleon Total War is similar to Empire Total War but is much improved. It takes you to the Napoleonic Wars where you can play many of Napoleon's battles and campaigns which were excellent and very fun to play. In the campaign of the coaliation however you play as one of the nations trying to stop Napoleon from unleashing hell in Europe. The battles in this game are very fun and the graphics look stunning if you have a good pc. The sound quality is perfect as you see soldiers in a line marching with a French flag in the front then stop and shoot a volley of bullets. This game deserves a 9/10 which is absolutely great I really recommend you to play this!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having played both Empire: and Napoleon: total war, I personally think the Napoleon is th better of the two. I had Empire on a seperate account (Which has been lost to the mists of time) and logged a LOT of time on it. It was fun (like most other games in this series), but I felt like most of the factions were monotinous and that the campaign wasn't all that great. Sure, there was 'MURICA but I still felt like it was more based on small armies and capturing cities, rather than the big-army based Napoleon. Napoleon, as said, has much better battles in campaign in my opinion, and the afformentioned factions that bugged me in Empire are pretty individual in Napoleon (Especially with the unit add-ons). France gets a bit OP in multiplayer battles, but hey, they were that way. My only other complaint is the graphics, but it is comparatively old. Overall, I give it a 9/10.Historically, 10/10: would establish the Prussian states of Italy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very good strategic game.  Both for the campaing and the battles are fun to play.  The one point I find frustating is the diversity of unit.  It becomes very difficult on the campaing map to understand the value and distinct advange of every unit (each nations has there own with their own bonus).  At a certain point there is just too much memorizing to know which fow has which strengh.  On the other hand, you can view your own.The sea batle were a challenging addition to the previous Total War franchise.  Campaings can be quite long to play.The engine for battles remains one of the best for strategy games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay-wise, this game is a lot of what Empire should've been at launch.  If you've played ETW or you're a fan of watching 100 men get shot down with shot and shell because a man in a large hat told them to run towards that hill over there, you're gonna have a good time. That said, very few of my hours with this game are with vanilla. The mods for this game are great and make the game so much better. I can personally recommend The Great War and Darthmod.10/10 would crush England again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome Game!!! the gameplay is smooth and the battles are fun. Ill play this for hours taking over the world. The only thing that I wish was different was that the ship battles would move faster. It takes forever for you and the opponent to reach each other on the battle-field in ship battles. Other than that, I think that this is a flawless game. Its fun to play and overall one of my favorite games to play. I would recomend this game anytime. Totally worth it!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like this game. When Empire: Total War first came out it was extremely buggy and frustrating to play(it still is for some things like sieges). It also lacked atmosphere, there wasnt that rush you got from playing rome or medieval where the music perfectly matched the noises and chaos of the battlefield.Napoleon does a lot to try and rectify these issues. The music is extremely atmospheric, playing music from the period it is set in. There are also many subtle improvements that make the experience fun such as a bar showing morale of units at a glance, ship repairs, melee for units in buildings and other things. Sadly it doesn't have the same scope that empire did where you got to take over most of the planet but the scenarios are fun and it is definitely a must buy for fans of CA.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Napoleon: Total War is an example of how stable of a release Creative Assembly can pull off. This is just a more stable version of Empire with many improvements, especially in the cleanness of the GUI interface. If you want a stable game and are interested in the Napoleonic period, go for this. Although, the title does limit the campaign by a bit. If you want more scope and variety and are willing to sacrifice a bit of stability to glitches, go for Empire.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was slightly scpetical when I first saw it as it just looked like Empire but this game was a pleasant surprise. The story based campaigns give real objective and purpose rather than being lost at what to do. Also, unlike Empire which has hundreds of factions, Napoleon is streamlined and has less factions meaning that you spend more time playing than waiting around.  The new models are awesome, weigh better looking than Empire and each man has a different face making them more human.Therefore I highly recommend this game and it is a great improvement from Empire.

												Napoleon: Total War.   Is the game worthy of the name ""Napoleon?"" That is an interesting question. In Vanilla, It does have it's issues. It is like a more atmosphereic version of Empire. It's campaign is shorter scaled, with a whole 2 cultures to take hold of. Either European (Prussia, Austria, Britain, Russia & France) or other eastern factions (eg. Ottomans, Egyptians, Mamelukes.) This game has, to be honest, a much better AI than empire did. If you enjoy Naval battles, Napoleon is better than Empire. BUT. BUT BUT BUT. The campaign is not anywhere near as wide-scoped as Empire's. With the Vanilla game, my conclusion is that Napoleon is better for a head on, Multiplayer fight. But Empire has a better, Longer and more open campaign. THERE IS A WAY TO MAKE NAPOLEON BETTER THAN EMPIRE ON EVERY ASPECT. This is acheived through ""Darthmod"". As many Total War junkies know, ""Darth Vader"" makes amazing mods for The Total War series. Napoleon is no exception. So if you do choose to get the game, which I beleive is worth the money, get Darthmod Napoleon. Thanks for reading,     Flyboy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me tell you my story in less than 15 lines: 1 year ago, winter time,my friends told me about this game, Mount&Blade Warband: Napoleonic Wars. I loved it! I was playing it day and night. Then I bought myself Warband, and then I traded for the DLC (Napoleonic Wars) I was so amazed by that game, I am still playing it. It is so addictive! Then, searching for Mount&Blade wallpapers, like 2 weeks ago, I found a lot of Napoleon Total War wallpapers. In that moment after I saw a gameplay and some cool images, I knew I wanted that game.  I couldn't buy it because of the money, so I tried to trade. And I did, so. And that's how I got it, after 2 weeks of watching gameplays, trailers, and getting cool wallpapers and playing demos. What can I say... I love Napoleonic Era. I still remember the first time I saw the intro on the internet. I loved the part when Emperor Napoleon says: ""Burn it!"". I give this game 10/10. I feel like playing it every day and night. Buy it and you won't regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A interesting game of the Napoleonic Era in history. Another game in the Total War Series. The game is similiar to Empire: Total War However, all the attention in terms of land warfare is focused entirely on the European continent. Just like in Empire: Total War there are Sea Trade routes to get to using trade ships while building Warships for protection, raiding, invading, and blockading ports. The trade routes are on the western part of the game map in the Atlatic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and even the Black Sea. In Napoleon: Total War you can take the lessons from Empire: Total War and apply them. Will you be one of the greatest strategiest in history Napoleon Bonaparte of France the 2nd AntiChrist (Depending on how you view Napoleon Bonaparte) and conquer all of Europe, or will you be one of the major powers of the time (Great Britian, Austria, Prussia, or Russia) fighting against Napoleon's France and then turning on your Allies to achieve your Victory conditions if need be? How will you create your alternative history in the Napoleonic Era?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fantastic game! In the previous Total War; Empire, I usually concentrated on using infantry, but in Napoleon Total War, you discover the importance of each infantry, calvary, and artillery. You will discover that you can't just win a battle or campaign by just using infantry, you would need to support them with artillery and use calvary as protectors of your flanks and target enemy generals and artillery. Out of 10, I would give it a 7.8. It is indeed a ""must-buy"". The only thing I have against this game is that during the campaign, you don't have a large economic budget as big as you would have on Empire Total War, but units would still be cheaper. It is fun and it gives me chills to see all the infamous commanders during the Napoleonic Wars. What is new about this game, is that units size are slightly increased, units reload A LOT faster, and new animations really bring the game to life. I love it, and you should love it too.   Vive La France!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, I have to say that this is probably my least favorite of the Total War series thus far. It isn't necessarily a bad game, it just failed to captivate my interest. The game seemed to be laggy no matter what I did, and I had frequent crashes. I personally just don't recommend the game, although I do highly recommend other Total War titles. I rate it at 4/10.

												Hey guys, so Napoleon total war, basicly focuses around the time frame of when Napoleon was in power, it is still a great game but i find playing it compared to Empire total war, this game is only a shorter spin off version. So its basicly to me a time killer if your getting bored of Empire. I was expecting abit more with nation choices and ofcourse a larger campaign again. My ratings a 5 outta 10. Good game but could have been better!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Total War is the most amazing game series ive ever played. Not even kidding.This is probally the 2nd worst in the series BUT its still a great game. If you LOVE Napoleonic combat and tactics and just the 19th century in general, then this is amazing for you. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A wonderful game to be sure. Napoleon: Total War thrusts you deep into the time of France's Emperor himself and allows you to wage war, make peace, and conquer the known world. If you don't already have it, you should buy it. If you already have it, why aren't you playing it right now?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For those who want to make the main parts of the european history of 19th century - this is the best strategy game ever! Nice and challenging turn-based strategy level, best real-time tactical battles. Load the cannons, form solid infantry lines, prepare cavalry ambushes and... dominate! 8-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NTW is perhaps one of the best total war games Creative Assembly has made. Percieved by many to be an expansion of sorts of Empire Total War, I find it to be in fact a better game than ETW. The things that I hated in ETW like long turn times and pointless research trees have been reduced. Many of the campaigns feature only a small number of factions so enemy turns only take a minute or two. And with research/technology being minimalized or nonexistant at times, the focus is purely on the army movement and real time battles. This game does a great job of showing off who Napoleon really was. He was a great general who conquered so many nations in the name of France. NTW lets you command in his shoes and experience what he felt in multiple areas of the world.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yep, great game. I reccommend this to everyone who enjoys tactical games. This game provides gameplay that you can't get from other total war games. The game itself has endless things you can do I promise you won't get bored. The one downside to this game that dissapointed me was the sea battles. The sea battles are boring and really hard and complicated to understand otherwise apart from that the game has generally all of the qualities you want in game. Also great cinematics.

												Let's see, When I first got this game it was the third in my steam library. As soon as I saw the intro I fell inlove I remember playing as the French against the Austrians, British, and well the rest of the world. Time and time again any enemy unit was either hunted down as it was shattered or mercifully spared so that I could kick its♥♥♥♥♥again and again! I have to say though that even when looking at Empire along with the fact that Empire has alot of the world Napoleon is a very fun game. The battles can get very immersive when you look through the eyes of a soldier.  Then after a while of playing this game vanilla and getting a stronger PC I got the LME4 Mod which made this game much more immersive and a lot more fun. With or without mod this game is a great total war to start with and gives you the potential immersive experience of Napoleon's La Grande Armee. As for the other countries, well they are fine but in my opionion the game doesn't pay much attention to them but still it provides a different feel for every faction such as Britain's navy, Austria's light infantry, and Russia's territory. However the vanilla game doesn't provide much gameplay for the other smaller countries like the Ottoman Empire or Bavaria. Despite the game's faults vanilla Napoleon total war is a great game to play. 10/10 Game, Vive L'empreur!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This was my second game i bought and my favorite along side men of war assault squad 2. The only problem that i have with it is just how easy the ai's are at times and when calvery units charge infantry units they dont have to be in a complete square to have some resistance against the impact. Other than that really fun and does not take along time to know how to play			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like this game but there are few problems with it. The game is not optimised for new PC's. Especially for the quad (or more) core processors because it mainly uses only one of your cores. And this game is really CPU intensive so that one core is simply not enough. Be aware of that when you'll be thinking of buying it. I have a GTX 860M and a i7 4710HQ 8gb ram and this game is working in 30-35 fps top. When zooming in it can go even lower than this. I've tried every fix that there is one the web and nothing is working for me. Same thing with the Empire: Total War.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I dislike tremendously that they added Sweden but not Denmark althought Danish decision to let Nelson pass instead of destrying his fleet was crucial to the success of the whole war.

Although its differs from the other total wars (empire not included due to the fact this is that improved and more organized) it is still great to play and sure to make to think. With darthmod this game gets even greater and the horizion expands. I would also rec this game to any wargammer or any real time stratagist gamer.

												Verry good game i really like the graphics a little better than empire total war, but the game could run a little better. the gameplay apsaloutly amazing very good to my standards i would sudjest this game 9/10 for someone who likes strategy games. Total War Series make another game in the timeline beetween 1750 and 1870 or like a Napoleon 2 or a Empire 2! It would be awesome to play another game with naval action and combat with rifles with that new game graphics you guys do so well in Rome II.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Napoleon Total War is a primarily European based game in terms of gameplay, do not expect anything exotic. It's gameplay and structure is much improved from the previous Empire Total War, the only thing lacking from Empire being the huge map. Napoleon is poised to conquer Europe and his enemies are many, almost the whole map, you will often be forced out of diplomatic alternatives and forced to fight your way to victory. But just the fact that you're playing as the French Empire, led by Napoleon I, gives you the feeling of invaulnerability and pride, making you undfeateadable in battle. An awe inspiring game, totally worth playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the worst examples of money-grabbing I've ever seen from a studio.  This is essentially the EXACT SAME game as Empire: Total War, just with a simpler and less expansive map.  The absymal AI therefore doesn't struggle as much as it did with Empire.  Other than that, CA essentially charged full price for a slightly-less broken, but much less deep, version of the exact same game they botched the year prior.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beside being recommended by Historia, I'm warning every player that want a real napoleonic warfare experience, because it is not historical AT ALL. For example, the french soldiers in 1805 had a special composition, called battalion. A line battatlion was formed of 4 line company, 1 grenadier company and 1 voltigeur company, and each company contained around 160 men. In Napoleon: Total War you do not play battalion, but company, wich is nonsense to me, because you can't make real tactic there, it limits the army size ( army less than 10.000 men, what.)Also, the moral in this game is a complete mess. There's no moral test when you lose troops, when you get charged....The game miss something epic.Despise being not historical at all, the graphics are really amazing, the animations are cool and the campaign are really well made, that's why I still recommend this game.

												While I still recommend the game because it is pretty good, I think you will find yourself enjoying Empire: Total War a bit more. Napoleon: Total War is a bit less free in that aspect, as it is, surprise surprise, focussed on the campaigns of Napoleon Bonaparte.Still, if you like the other Total War games, you won't be disappointed with this one.

												So, i don't generally write reviews but this game has so much going on. It's fantastically in depth and fun to play, but at the same time if you don't like playing a 20 minute long battle it's probably best you let the battles be done on autoresolve. Also, diplomacy was a little bit underwhelming considering that the game was developed and made in 2010 i was hoping for better AI diplomacy. I love the total war series and this is another great one, but if you would rather play a faster paced version of this game i would recomend a game called Imperial Glory. Same time period and all of that but much faster paced. Again, this is a wonderful game but seems to take a ton of time and devotion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always enjoyed this game and have played it consistently since its release some years ago. Although I played the core French campaigns once over, I prefer focusing on the 'Campaign of the Coalition' (where you fight as Britain, Prussia, Austria or Russia) with Britain as my preferred choice.I found Spain turns into a bit of machine if left unchecked (Their armies went absolutely ham on Gibraltar and I just didn't understand where their income was comign from) So essentially apart from the AI being a little weird from time to time it is very good.Diplomacy is solid and realistic - I really enjoy the seabattles! Campaigns are a bit slow to begin with, since it takes a while to build anything but very gripping once you get going!			",56,1,3,1,8,0,14

												Napoleon: Total War was my second ever Total War game, right behind the original Rome: Total War. I immediately noticed differences from the R:TW that made the game a little harder for me to play, but with the help of a friend and the in-game tutorial guide, I got the hang of it pretty quickly. I completed the Campaign as Prussia, and then downloaded the DarthMod. I can with certainty that I enjoyed the game, and that it had me hooked trying to gradually conquer France for a long time. The game is historically accurate. The Unit Size is a bit unrealistic, but DarthMod fixes this and adds many cool features to the game as well. The units also act stupid pretty often, but that's just something you have to deal with. Once took me 10 minutes to get my cannons to face the right way. If you enjoy strategy games or Total War, I'd definitely reccomend at least giving this a try. After you try the vanilla game, install DarthMod, and try it again. Overall fun. I give it an 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is inferior to empire in the campaign, unit diversity and tactics. It has better graphics and effects but that does not mean much. NTW is a slight improvement over ETW in that its more focused on a few things but overall its no better because the campaign map is 1/3 as big, diplomacy got practically removed, and everyone has freakin' line infantry with a cannon or two. NTW has the best historical battles of any total war game though! It has really good ship battles though! It has thunderous cannons! Screaming frenchies! Overall I barely reccomend it because it feels less like a total war game and more like the same battle you will fight again and again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A truly amazing strategy game, Napoleon Total War challenges gamers' strategic know-how in an outnumbered situation on all fronts. With beautiful graphics and top notch preformance, you are in for a good time. Each mode has its unique play strategies to boast for and i must say I have a lot of fun playing it. The GSA team rates Napoleon Total War 4 out of 5, losing a star only because of the work-in-progress speed settings. Will youy be the next to slip into Napoleon's shoes and rewrite history?

												Total war with guns.  Generals and cav in general are susceptible to quick gun death if they engage head on.   Infantry is more about volley combat rather than melee.  Cannons are an actual big deal unlike most total war games.  All in all good stuff, though a bit different than the traditional total war games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are many layers of strategy in this game.  You have the option of fighting each battle as a general directing troops in the field or auto resolving them if you prefer. When you are certain your plans are sound a surprise will force you to rethink to remain in control of the larger campaign map and it is very gratifying.  The opening cinematic scene impressed me with its voice acting.  There is an element of building up your nation as you are knocking down your opponents which I enjoy.  The help is set to on automatically.  It is useful the first three times you play. After that shut it off.  10/10.			",5,8,0,8,6,0,12

												Napoleon Total War is a primarily European based game in terms of gameplay, do not expect anything exotic. It's gameplay and structure is much improved from the previous Empire Total War, the only thing lacking from Empire being the huge map. Napoleon is poised to conquer Europe and his enemies are many, almost the whole map, you will often be forced out of diplomatic alternatives and forced to fight your way to victory. But just the fact that you're playing as the French Empire, led by Napoleon I, gives you the feeling of invaulnerability and pride, making you undfeateadable in battle. An awe inspiring game, totally worth playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
