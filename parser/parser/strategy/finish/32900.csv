												It's a dated game, yeah.  But for those who like to play tycoon games where they are in control of everything in a restaurant, it gets pretty addicting to check profits and figure out how to reach the goals in each scenario.  The first campaign starts a bit hard because not everything is accessible and the player is expected to play with whatever the tutorial gives.  I had to fire more than 5 servers before I found two that wouldn't be rude to customers because I didn't have access to staff training yet.  Managing the restaurants is no easy task as the player is expected to know how to be successful in finances and food.  Players could easily cheat by using codes that are readily available, but where's the fun in that?  Some might complain about the super bright glowing effects when they first play the game, but that can be remedied by turning off all glow features in ""Settings"".  Eventually, the player will be in control of what s/he wants to put in the restaurant as well as serve in the restaurant while keeping in mind of ratings.  There's a little bit of free customization for the floors, walls, and employee outfits.Time passes in a day in the game's universe, meaning the restaurant operates within 24 hours and every minute counts.  At the end of the day, whatever money that is generated is multiplied by 30 or 31 to represent monthly revenue or profits.  Therefore, the player should avoid wasting too much time by letting the minutes pass while deciding how to arrange furniture or improve recipes, but that's why the pause button is there!Overall, someone who is easily enticed by tycoon or management games can get easily stuck in his or her seat for a few hours trying to get perfect ratings or avoiding debt (at least... I did.) ",155,23,3,17,9,0,13

												This game has two storyline campaigns:1. An improved version of Restaurant Empire 1 where you build French, Italian, and American resturants2. The actual sequal to the first game's storyline where you build desert and coffee houses as well as French, American, German resturantsThe scenarios were really easy to beat such as get X revenue/profit and/or Y customers in the allocated time. All you need to do is align your tables to maximize your servers' mobility and put a bunch of decorations everywhere to boost your restaurant's rating.---I've played a lot of tycoon games in my childhood and it's saddening to see this genre die. After playing this game, I can see why. The concepts are great but the execution is terrible.Gameplay in a nutshell:1. Pause game2. Place tables and decorations in your restuarant3. Hire staff4.  Add recipes to the menu5. Save game6. Fast forward time7. ???8. Profit!My biggest complaint with this game is that whenever you get access to a higher quality ingredient supplier, you need to go into EACH recipe to change your supplier. Once you've done that, you have to adjust the price of that recipe in EACH resturant. If you don't do these, your food rating will suck and/or your profit margins will drop. I guess the developers wanted to allow more micromanagement but it's annoying when you just want to update all of your resturants.Other things to consider:- There's no 16:9 support- The textures/models are outdated (this game was released in 2009)- The auto save for the campaign doesn't work for me- You have a finite number of chefs in the campaign so don't fire them!Overall, I still think it's a decent tycoon game. If you're bored with the other popular tycoon games (SimCity, Game Dev Tycoon, Eve Online), give this game a shot if it's on sale.			",57,14,1,8,12,0,16

												Overall, it's a fun game but there are some negatives to it.Its fun setting up the restaurant.  Placing the tables just right so there are no traffic issues.  That way people don't have to wait too long for their food.  Decorating the inside and outside of the restaurant so your place looks classy.  Entering the cooking contests to climb the chef ranks.  Being able to control every aspect of your restaurants and watching them make money is gratifying.  There haven't been updates or improvements to this game from the first Restaurant Empire.  Heck, you could probably consider this a long delayed expansion pack to the first one.   Armand, the main character is still wearing the same pants.  They were ugly then and they're still ugly today!  If you didn't like the first Restaurant Empire, you won't like the second one.  The AI of your employees is still really frustrating.  Your restaurants are still not going to be perfect.  And no matter what you do or how well you do it, customers are going to complain. They're never happy! (and I do mean never!)  Some of the scenarios can be maddening to try and complete.  Despite all this, the game does keep me entertained.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of your usual Tycoon games, telling the story of Armand LeBoeuf: a young french chef who just graduated from culinary school. We play through the basics of financial management, collect recipes of world cuisine and train other chefs to challenge the authority of OmniFood, a corporate firm that monopolized food industry years ago. Aside from side goals being a bit challenging to accomplish, the actual campaign is easy to get done. All you have to do is get things in order and wait till the end of month, which makes this game real casual and relaxing, more like a simulation even.So far, I can count this game as one of my favorite tycoon games, aside from old classics like Theme Hospital or Zoo Tycoon. It gives you a perspective on food business and presents the basics of becoming a restauranteur. It is fun, and educating in a manner. Never have been a good cook myself, I get to stumble upon some really cool recipes that I'd like to try someday :) If you're into the subject, it's a neat game.			",353,800,0,204,86,0,63

												Let me start with a story;A long time ago, back when Waffles© was just a wee lad, he had a grand total of ten dollars and fifty cents.  Being the spendthrift little boy as he was, he ventured into the local Walmart store to find a jolly old game to play on his parents computer.  Little boy Waffles© soon found a cheerful looking game by the name of Restaurant Empire that he immediantly began to want for.  The total price of the game?  $10.00 (and 50 cent tax).  He gleefully skipped to the check-out counter where he paid his ten and fifty and ran home to enjoy his new-found game.  Ohh but what fun he had playing this joy of a game!  Hours upon hours where spent building restaurants, organizing menus, and hiring staff.  The young boy who was Waffles© was overjoyed at this seemly limitless game!A dozen years later, grown man Waffles© browses the Steam store to find another game to review in a dire attempt to become noticed by the Steam community.  Startled, he runs across a familiar title: Restaurant Empire II.  What?  Was he being decived?  His childhood game had a sequel?  And was on Steam?  Thanking Gaben, Waffles© quickly bought the game instead of Super Noah's Ark 3D, downloaded, and installed it.  A couple hours later, here he is, ready to give his honest opinion on the game.Restaurant Empire II is a restaurant tycoon simulator where you take control of a young chef, fresh out of culinary school and ready to take on the Omnifood corporation.  The game plot is rather simple, and most of the mechanics are even more so.  The main goal of the game is to keep your customer satisfaction level high in order to maintain a five stay rating.  You do so by selecting dishes that have high ratings, updating your furniture to increase comfort levels, placing decorations to... well, increase your decoration level, and hiring and training staff to provide the best customer care possible.  In the sandbox mode, this is actually quite easy as you start out with a large building and you cannot start out with lower than $500,000.  I simply furnished the bottom floor, hired my staff and spent $10,000 a month on training them (after several months there were virtually no complaints about them), added only dishes that had a 75% or above approval rating, and decorated the floor so extravagantly that a four star rating was achieved in a few months in game time.  The five star rating took only about a year!  Really, the main strength of the game is the original campaign which only gives you $40,000 to start out with.  Although you also begin with a fully decked out kitchen, dining room, and restrooms, you still have to add decoration, add dishes, hire staff, etc.  Several of the options (such as advertising and training) are blocked so the jerks who are your staff act all high and mighty for the first dozen challenges without the ability for you to stop them.  To throw a curveball when you least expect it, a well known character in the game gives you $250,000 to set up and maintain his nephew's new restaurant, which has no kitchen or restrooms.  Meaning you have to set up everything with the money you've saved up to that point.  The challenge is real and completing all objectives can be difficult but fun.Because the mechanics are so simple, I really have to look at the game as a whole in order to give my full opinion on it, and frankly, there is not much to see.  Perhaps if the game had a fancy HD remastering, or an ambitious remake, the appeal would be greater.  The game feels pulled out of it's time in the steam market with fancy titles like Prison Tycoon, or Tropico V to keep it company, but without the aesthetic of it's counter parts it largely goes unnoticed.  Despite this, I wholeheartedly recommend Restaurant Empire II to the individual looking for such a game.  Maybe it's the nostalgia kid in me happy to play this game once again, but REII is a joy to play and quite simply a time waster for tycoon fans to enjoy.I rate this game 6.5/10, would loose childhood in again.Thank you for your time!The Older but not WiserWaffles©			",225,49,2,36,36,2,28

												First of all i don't know what's wrong with this game....It's really really geniusI... I.... ok lets be serious now.I have played this game enough to know that this game is a master-game, so to speak. I see no problem with it, the graphics are ehhh but the gameplay and the campaigns are good, the ways and things you can make your restaurant is amazing and controlling the restaurant is even more amazing. The campaign Scenario's can be hard, but if you just want to play this game for killing time or something, you can go with the Sandbox Mode!! This game provides everything for every type of player. You can change the dishes in your menu, you can even give discounts when you want, you can increase/decrease the money you spend on a dish i.e you can raise or decrease the Quality of a dish. You can assign a chef to every particular dish and if you don't have time to do that any of your chef creates the recipe and serves it. You can hire people to work for your restaurant like Servers, and Captains who take orders, Receptionists etc etc... You can participate in a cooking competition. You can do almost EVERYTHING you can do in a real life restaurant as its owner. I really recommend this game, it's worth more than it's price. The amount of people who play this game is low because it's too old but i think if people become aware of this game, It could be in the list of the top sellers.			",70,18,0,10,7,0,7

												Restaurant Empire II is the sequel to Trevor Chan’s Restaurant Empire which was released back in 2003 and although I have not played the original fans of both games give you the distinct impression that Restaurant Empire II is really just a glorified expansion to the original. Taken on it's own merits however, it's a decent enough management game that unfortunately gets bogged down in minutia and micromanagement rather quickly.The game starts you off with the campaign from the original game, a new campaign based more around Desert House's and Coffee Shops and a sandbox mode. The sandbox mode however is pretty barebones and many of the staples from the campaigns, such as the minigames, chef reputation, cooking contests etc are removed. Add that to the fact that in Sandbox you start with pretty much everything already unlocked it becomes a rather futile experience.The campaigns start you off as a small restaurant owner and slowly unlocks content and areas as you progress through various scenarios with pre-set goals. A small dash of storyline is thrown in but it can be safely ignored. Your goals throughout the campaign vary rather wildly in difficulty and it's often best to delay winning the easier scenarios until the very last moment so that you can use the extra time for your chefs and staff to get more skilled and more money to flow into your bank account.The game at it's core is simple enough, you start a restaurant, place a kitchen, some bathrooms, furnish the seating area, hire some staff, pick a menu and off you go. However once you get going the game becomes anything but simple. The game will often tell you that you have trouble serving meals on time but doesn't give you any information as to why that is. Should you hire more servers? Hire more chefs? Move the tables closer to the kitchen? Solving problems with your restaurants quickly becomes purely trial and error until you get that perfect setup that you will never have to change. It doesn't help that the AI path-finding is nothing short of atrocious.And that brings us to the menu. As you progress through the game you will start to unlock specialty ingredient suppliers which allows you to increase the quality of your meals at a cost, however using these new high quality ingredient's have to be done individually for each recipe in each restaurant and likewise for changing the price making it an incredibly frustrating experience.All in all Restaurant Empire II is a game with a few good ideas that are unfortunately marred by it's many design flaws and it's not really a game I'd recommend to anyone but extreme fans of management simulations. If you have a burning desire to play a game that lets you build and manage a chain of eateries I suppose this is really your only choice but if not, then you can find better entertainment elsewhere.

												Great Game, I wish more of these games were made as it actually requires you to think about what you are doing. Yeah sure, it would have been nice if you could pack the tables in tighter and hire more Captains. But this drawback means you have to find a solution which is part of the principle of a good biz strat.I hope they make a 3rd installment and recommend this game highly.			",15,5,4,5,63,0,36

(otherwise i doubt they will be adressed) first off they should have a mode between story and sandbox where you should be able to do as you wish but have challenges and the oppertunity to do cooking tournaments/shows. second there should be a multiplayer option for people to play against thier friends. last but not least they should add player modding. other then those three issues the game is great. if you love tycoon type games this is definately worth getting.i give this game a 8/10			",31,8,0,17,18,0,17

												This is my first review so please bare with me.  What I liked about the game is that I really had to think, I had to think about what kind of servers I wanted, and whether or not I wanted to open the upstairs dinning area or not. I had to use the chefs that was available very wisely, of course once your reputaion is high enough then you get chefs that ask to join you. If I am honest I had to play through a number of times to get it right for myself. Graphics are a little dated but that is not a big thing with me.  Its story mode is very good and I liked how Restaurant Empire 1 and 2 tie in together, in other words if you have never played a simulator game then its best to start with one and go from there.  All in all if you really like to play simulator games and don't really care for graphics or if you want to try something new I recommend this game but wait for it to go on sale.			",9,8,0,2,1,0,3

												I played the orginal and liked it however it seems on steam that after a good bit of gameplay it goes white and I can't make out a thing even if the game is still going and customers still eating as from the actuall game I never had this problem on older systems that when it was not on steam. I don't know if it could be steam or that it just doesn't work with a windows 8.1 os as many old games seem to do these days unless the code was rewritten some how and some way. Heck I bought Rise of Nations from the store and my mouse wouldn't move an inch. Comes to find out it is the Windows 8.1 os as many games. The highest many games go to is 7 or lower. So a lot of games are just not os friendly for new os's. Heck I would love to play some fallout and the same issue many others were having it just doesn't work on our OS as the games are out dated and not a soul is revamping many for new os's. Sad but I know. This game is a good game otherwise back like in 95. I really liked it though. So maybe I am just an ole gessure lol...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think most have covered gameplay, and yes this game could be made nice with an update and some more features added. But the basic game is fun, not for those that don't like simulation games. It does take quite a while to get the hang of how it all works in the finer details. Once you understand then it becomes easier to manage. The shitbag complaining customers need addressing, as some settings need scaling back. A real restaurant would be broke real quick with half the amount of complaining customers. Aside from that...To be honest it is not a game you would play continuously, but is good in here are there. For and old game still is pretty good and the price is good.  Hopefully the game will get a good overhaul.Played a lot more on old game on last PC so steam hours don't reflect. ",11,1,0,3,20,0,4

												As someone who hasn't played the original Restaurant Empire, but has a big love for strategy/tycoon games. I love this!It is an older game, the graphics aren't incredible but the gameplay is quite fiddly and immersive!I have a terrible perfectionist/completist streak, i am constantly fiddling with my restaurant, decorations, the menu. Buying new recipes/techniques off customers, adding suppliers, then having to re go over my whole menu and make sure all the ingredients are coming from the correct place.. So incredibly immersive and fun if you like this genre of game. The only con to the gameplay is the customers...They never stop complaining.Ever.McDonalds gets less complaints.I'd  super advise youtubing this before buying it. The gameplay is completely different to other cooking games i.e Diner Dash, Emily's ect.			",20,14,0,2,12,0,0

												Review: A little over complecated in some respects and over simplistic in others, but this game certainly has its own unique charm that definatly makes it worth playing over and over.Background history: Found this game advertised in a game called ""Capitalism II"" (lot of fun what it was). I downloaded the demo embeded in the capitalism game, and played it over and over, meanwhile searching for a copy of it in stores for months. Thankfully i finally found it and played the game to death years ago, until i found this one recently on steam. Essentually the same game as the origional but with some new features and slightly better graphics (THANK YOU).			",54,10,0,8,41,0,31

												As a fan of the first Restaurant Empire game, at first I was disappointed with this one. A lot of the animations are the same, and this game adds coffee and dessert shops, so you have customers eating sandwiches and cookeis with forks and knives. Also, all the customers are talking on cell phones and using laptops now, which is annoying when you're waiting for a chance to click on them. I actually quit the game for a long time because of these irritations.However, I recently came back to it and I'm glad I did. It's a lot of fun as a strategy game, and still fun just to tinker around with the restaurants and watch the chefs cook. The first game lacked female chefs, aside from Delia, but this time there are plenty of them, and that's a welcome change too. The game isn't very difficult, but it has some challenge to it, and it's hard to find challenging strategy games these days.The storyline is entertaining. Armand gains some fame as a celebrity chef and gets a big head, putting his marriage in jeopardy. I've only played through once, so I don't know if there's a different outcome for different choices. I'll probably play again just to find out. And I hope there will be a Restaurant Empire III because I'll buy it. Yes, the game is old and clunky looking, but it's still great to play.

												Fun game, epecially for those who work in the restaurant industry. Only flaw is captial is tight and it doesn't allow too much freedom in the game as you would seem when you get further in. A couple crashes here and there so save your progress!			",1,11,0,2,6,0,4

												The game looked good at first, but I found it to not be that satisfying.The game is very limited in objects and recipes. I feel like many of the actions doesn't seem to have a reaction. Sometimes, even though you tried all possibilities you have for certain specific points, they all return a negative feedback.  May be part of the game mechanic, but is a little frustrating.The management part is not bad at all. You have to keep an eye in statistics and customer feedback. Need to find the balance between price and quality, accordingly to what your customers expect. This is the part of the game I liked.In my opinion, the tutorial levels are a little exhausting. But I felt it was kinda necessary to give a good overview of the game mechanics, so it's ok.Not entirely sure I should recommend it, but I feel that people who like this type of game may want to play it.6/10			",263,61,3,29,40,3,32

Review in English/Spanish Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  Restaurant Empire II is a tycoon simulator and as you can guess it’s about managing your own restaurant franchise,  unfortunately time has taken its toll and the game is not up to today’s standards, I personally found it rather amusing but the badly designed UI, the poor camera controls among others made the experience very dull.Consider a purchase if you are willing to let those issues slip by. Español:  Se trata de administrar tu propia cadena de restaurantes y llegar a la cima culinaria. Es un juego decente pero que ha sufrido de los estragos del tiempo, la interfaz es torpe, la cámara algo complicada y el juego pese a que tiene un centenar de opciones se resume en crear un menú de comidas y dejar que las cosas sigan su rumbo (no se suele notar mucho el efecto de todas las opciones que puedes tocar)Lo recomendaría dado el caso que quieras un juego de simulación y no encuentres nada mejor.

												It's actually a really fun game once you learn all the in and outs.  If you don't have a good restaurant layout, waiters and customers will get clogged up which will lead to slower service and complaints.  Cramming as many seats into a place might be your first instinct, and maybe it is the best thing to do, but it often ends up in a lower experience and rating overall for your restaurant.  These nuances are what make the game interesting and fun, well worth the couple of bucks.			",38,7,2,18,18,0,34

												The sequel to the widely popular Restaurant Empire game takes you further into the depths and delights of the culinary universe than ever before.Take part in an exciting world where the customers are fickle and the bounty in your cash register changes as quickly as their tastes. With two handfuls of cash and a dream of stamping a legacy, build, cook and hire your way to the very top of the gastronomic biz, where tasty food is king and smart management reels in the cash. And if you're lucky, you just may go further than any other before you and cement your status as a true legend of cuisine...			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												I spent many a time playing this game a while back. I had a crappy computer that wasn't built for gaming but that didn't matter to me at at the time and I played this game alot! I restarted alot and tried different techniques. it was awesome.Now when I saw it on steam I was really excited and happy because I never heard that they made it for steam or that they made a sequel so I purchased it right away and went right back into enjoying every second. I even stopped playing the game I was mildly obsessed with just to get back  into this game. I nailed every challenge perfectly and made it to my second resturant and saved the game so I could get my kids to bed. I was a happy camper.As soon as I had enough time to jump back into my game I logged on immediately to continue my journey and EVERYTHING I HAD ACCOMPLISHED WAS GONE!  I had to start all over again and it's happened 3 times to it's safe to say I probably wont be playing this game again.....very disappointed. It's a great game if you don't mind restarting every SINGLE time you load your game.			",30,13,2,11,14,0,12

												While the game itself is sort mundane, if you're into micro-management it's conceptually good. Once you get your business running, it can be difficult to improve upon anything, as the feedback is minimal. Yes you may learn that one of your servers is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but that's about it. Or that your dish may be disgusting, but you may only pay for over-priced advice on how to make it better. Ingredient tweaking would make this game better, as well as more options in terms of the business itself. Being able to actualy cook some dishes would be immense, and make this slightly more interactive. Even during cooking competitions, we don't actually make the food. There are minigames that are completed that may or may not even increase your chances of winning the competition. Being able to actually interact with the food only makes sense.Basically, you blitz through the initial set up of the restaurant, and then sit and watch your profits barely change. It's good for passing time, and on a whole its sort of fun, but it could be sooooo much better with some effort.			",28,3,0,6,17,0,5

												I unfortunately cannot really recommend this game.The camera controls are horrendous.This game feels like the Sims, only you run a restaurant.As soon as I opened my first restaurant, complaints piled in; mostly about the receptionist.  After firing/hiring receptionists due to complaints, I have exhausted the amount of receptionists available and have begun re-hiring the ones I've fired.  None of them seem to make the customers happy.I did like being able to design the restaurant, including the menu.Also, the tutorial did a great job in explaining how to play.I haven't tried sandbox mode... maybe I'll enjoy it when I do?  But for now, I have stopped having fun while playing this game.			",317,116,16,78,44,5,62

												Restaurant Empire II is restaurant managing game. It a average tycoon game. In my opinion it focuses too much on the customer satisfaction and not enough on the economy aspect. It also has some weird design choices like the cooking contests. Unless you really want to manage a restaurant in your tycoon game I would just play a better tycoon game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Graphics look brilliant on start-up, as soon as you get in-game it lacks the impression you first get...Overall quality was poor in my opinion, the chat is too small even in 1920 x 1080. Poor figures, music is also a let down...Too many options darted around the game which makes it rather confusing, you spend more time looking for a statistic rather than taking control of the restaurant. Types of food wasn't impressive, very limited...Tutorial was long and tedius, lacked what most games would have if they were a simulation game...Don't recommend this at all...
