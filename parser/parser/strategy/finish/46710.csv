												Bad, just bad. It's a very boring and dull game with few game mechanics and I suggest steering to port at 125 degrees before you hit this iceberg of a game.			",6,0,0,2,6,0,5

												Well, I got this cos I'm quite a nerd for ironclad ships, but I think I really wasted my money even though I got it pretty cheap on sale.  The gameplay is barely there, all you can do is steer your columns of ships and tell them when to start firing.  you can't target specific enemy ships, you get very little info about the status of any ships.  I was very dissapointed as I really wanted this game to be at least ok.			",149,18,17,10,18,2,19

												having played now a littl eof this i think it is an okay game to get if on sale perhaps but its appeal is going to be restricted to only the few diehard fans of the period who like their battles to move at a snails pace and also to how a limited role in activity of the battle itselfyou can direct the ship column and you can alter its speed and tell it not to fire if you want, though i cant see any reason ever to do so- there is no way to change formations in battle or even to detach a ship from you column - these omissions i find strangeperhaps the biggest gripe i would have are the non-existent collision physics - for a historical game like this where the close quarters ship firefights happen alot as the AI will come right in to fight, there are frequent collisions, but the ships just bounce of each stutteringly until one a bounce enough to move away - this is ridiculous when the pointy end of an ironclad civil war gun ship rams into the side of a wooden sailing vessel - there is no destruction occurring at all, except for the slight percentage damage added to the ships damage stat - but this sometimes doesnt occur at all - ram a ship like this would certainly sink at least one of them outrighti will recommend the game because it is easy to play with and i think the graphics are nice enough, but with the above caveats about its shoddy collision physics and limited player controls			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do NOT buy this game, here is why:- ZERO help, figure everything out by yourself, there isn't even a text help file you can read- LAGGY interface, you never know if you actually clicked something or not- BAD graphic, I know not to expect much, but the ships looks bad, so does the sea- NO FUN its a really really boring game, doubt most people will finish the first battle (takes quite a while)Worst of all:- NO POINT - It was an absolutely pointless experience			",427,130,29,81,98,5,150

												a very nice game.for those who complain that there is no tutorial, i suggest that you consult the game manual.its brief, clear and does the job.for those who say its a slow boring game i suggest that realistic naval wargames are obviously not your thing.this game is very tactical and rewarding.my only complaint is that i can t turn the music off!
