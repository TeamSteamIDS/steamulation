												The game offers a very unique and interesting gameplay experience. It is well crafted and stable and no bugs have come to my knowing. It has some minor balance issues and design flaws. Overall i can recommend this game to people interested in RTS, who like to take on a challenge. This game is difficult. Stay away from it if you can not stand losing over and over again.The UI is thought out well and is very intuitive.Visuals are done nicely, no eyesore to be expected.The current standard price of about 20$ is more than justified.What is it about?To sum it up: The russian devs have built a hero management simulation on top of a classic RTS basis. It plays pretty fresh, and feels damn good.Basically, the units you build have minds on their own. There is no way to directly control them.They do hero stuff, they wander around in search of monsters and loot, they level up just like all heroes do and can become even better with shinier armor and bigger swords.Given some time, success and little dying they can develop from a wooden sword swinging wannabe knight to a professional murdering machine.They misjudge their chances and die in silly ways quite often, hindering the individual progress, cost you a lot of money and ultimately, cause you to fail the map. So, the chaotic bunch needs to be directed somehow. This is where the player jumps in. You can interact with various Spells on a smaller scale, but: What do heroes like ? Exactly, shiny things and money.Orders are handled by issuing quests. For example, there is a wolves den which annoys you. You can create a quest for your guys, by putting a reward on it. Heroes will take on that quest if they feel like its worth it, and soon, the wolves den will be history.The earned money then goes to that heroes purse and he will use it to buy Potions, enchant or buff himself in Guildhouses or buy new equipment if he doesn't die before he can spend it.The money spent by heroes comes back to your purse for the most part, so its a game of give and take. With the added risk of the hero dying, resulting in loss of that money with additional resurrection costs. (These can become very very costly with increasing levels)All Heroes will be acting selfishly on their own by default, giving little to no support to the ""competing"" heroes. Later on, you get the Option to group them into parties of up to four, making them work together to combine their abilities and increase in power by a lot. But also decreasing their response to quests significantly, which means, they'll consider themselves very elite and move out only for phat lewt.After every mission you get the chance to promote one hero to ""Lord"", saving him for reuse on the following maps. Which is a good but costly option. Some maps can only be won by utilizing this feature wisely. All other heroes are lost on map transition.This might sound all nice and cozy, and, yeah, when the basics are understood, the first few missions are not much of a problem.But the difficulty rises quite fast and brutal. The maps are very different from each other and you will need to come up with a solid build order and make it work over several attemps on each new mission again. You are under constant attack from the very beginning and can fail the mission very fast if attempting the wrong way. Gamechanging scripted events can cause sudden death even later on if handled wrong. It soon becomes a game of Chess, were you will need a clear plan of what to do when and perfect execution. The combination of this with the games occasional randomness can cause frustration at times. You've done nothing wrong, but still are wiped out brutally.This factor will multiply when later on, your opponents have leveling heroes as well, and failure will therefore be punished twice, by losing a lot of money, and having to face more powerful enemies. Resulting in very very frustrating moments.I'd say, the game, a couple of hours in, is a lot about trial and error and aims towards players with some dedication and will to win and has nothing to offer for casual players at all.For the more hardcore, there is a lot of fun to be had here.Having played the first part too, i really hope for a Majesty 3, the Game has come a long way already. I hope the developers see that too and give it another attempt. They could turn this already damn good, but underdog, game into a total blockbuster.			",42,8,1,28,15,0,9

Update 1/2/17 A patch for the DLC has been released, and ""approved"" by Paradox! As that has been patched, this game is once again worth full value. Thank you to Nitrostriker for bringing this up, you can access the fix on the official paradox forums here: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/majesty-2-collector-dlc-fix.983538/I know this game has been out for quite a while, but I'm mostly reviewing it to state it's still worth getting. I have about 300 more hours from a DRM free version, so however many hours I have on here is not accurate.If you're just curious about the ""Collection"" edition portion, it is worth the money based on the sheer amount of content added.For those who haven't played the first... (see below if you have played the first)It isn't important that you have played the first, as there isn't really any important information to transfer to the second. If you have ever wanted to play an RTS in which you don't have to deal with managing everything your units are doing, this is likely the game for you. It requires quick thinking (or average thinking at .2x speed) and some knowledge of each guild and building, but the main campaign eases you into the game at a pace that will teach you all you need to know. Many of the missions have unique side missions to make sure there's variation each time you play.Certain missions can be very difficult and will require you to be entirely precise in your decisions at the start (such as the mission in the King Maker expansion that sends a bunch of dragonlings at you near instantly). Clerics and Dwarven towers will quickly become your best friends.For those who have played the first...I've played the original majesty for likely 400+ hours, and have a lot of knowledge and memories of it to show for it. I see a lot of the negative reviews and comments are based solely upon the original ""being better"". I personally find this one to be much more than the first in almost every way. If you've played the first, you can expect to miss this... (cons) The tournament has been removed (my biggest negative) Heroes are harder to guide. No more naming of heroes. Mushrooms for poison have been turned into just an upgrade. Religious temples are now only able to be placed at set locations. A few other things.However, the additions make this one worth playing. (pros) Much easier UI to use. 3D graphics (which in my opinion are better). Many buildings combined (the library is now inherent in guilds) (may not be a pro to some) More guilds. A few extra skills, including skills gained at certain levels per class. More intuitive spell system. Many more missions. Ability to play as the enemies in a special campaign mode. Buildings don't completely catch fire when a rat bites it (who else was annoyed by this?) Heroes don't feel as squishy. (except for the mage. Expect them to still die every five seconds for their lower levels) Many more things.As for the difficulty...Yes, this game is 0 to 100 on certain missions, but all of them are completely possible. You will have to utilize the .2x speed button very frequently and will occassionally have to baby-sit your lower leveled powerful heroes with the heal spell. If all else fails, you can usually go back to using two cleric guilds at the start. Clerics are the toughest unit in the game as long as you can keep them together, as they're nearly infinitely powerful as long as some mana exists. Shortly after, you will want to get dwarves for both the unit and especially the tower. One tower alone is enough to kill a werewolf or a dragon, which can easily level an entire settlement early on. By placing a normal guard tower behind each dwarven tower, you effectively multiply the effectiveness of each tower by a decent bit.Krypta appears to be the most useful special hero for their sheer ability to stay alive while dealing heavily spread out damage with their minions.Also, do not forget to use inns. Having a few scattered on each side can save your heroes, since often times the guild is just far enough to have them killed when they retreat. Conclusion All in all, I feel this one is more full than the first. There are some noticeable changes, but for the most part, it's just something to get used to rather than miss intensely. This game is worth your time, and will immerse you faster than you might expect.			",107,13,4,22,14,1,14

												A God game comparable to the greatest one, Dungeon Keeper, Majesty 2 has beautiful music and could be one of the best games you've ever played or repetitive and frustrating, depending on your tastes. It's reminiscent of any classic roleplaying game, except the usual player characters are NPCs, and you set the quests and build the cities that they rest and shop in. It is a pleasure to watch the heroes grow in strength, pop the health potions that they bought from you, learn new skills, work together, and sometimes (or often), die together.Majesty 2 is one of those rare and valuable games that is more difficult than its predecessor.

												I can easily say this is my favorite game. Even when I don't feel like playing anything else, I can play a round of Majesty. Some folks like to call out the game's difficulty like it were a bad thing. I won't pretend like it isn't hard, and that I don't routinely restart missions, but that just means you actually have to strategize and plan ahead. I consider it fun! And because of the ""Randomize"" feature (on top of several campaigns + stand-alone missions), the game has incredible replayability. I do notice that sometimes the game crashes when I go to save, which isn't a problem for me because I've completed everything already, but for new players, I should warn you.I recently bought the Collection on Steam because it includes DLC that is no longer being sold. It's a good deal!			",85,38,1,51,33,2,31

												Majesty has been my favorite RTS ever since playing it as a young kid on Windows 98 and the sequel has improved on a lot the first one had to offer. Majesty isn't your regular RTS, you don't actually control your units, you build your kingdom and then use your wealth to bribe your heroes and play into their personalities to get them into doing what you desire. This also isn't an easy game, it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ around you WILL have to restart some missions until you can develop a strategy, also I reccomend to play with the Randomize option on, otherwise when you restart you will just know where everything is. This collection comes with The base game and 3 expansions, I haven't even touched  the expansions yet and already feel as though I got my moneys worth. Highly reccomended to anyone who likes RTS games!			",145,13,1,14,13,1,20

												Hey all.I'm coming from Majesty 1.Basically, to me, it's same game with a little bit advanced graphics.New flag mechanics are satisfying (ie defend flag).In Majesty 2 you overall have more controll on your units which is a good thing... but a bad thing.You see, whole thing about majesty 1 was that you are a King. So you have wishes and a bunch of gold to make wishes come true and there are people who can help you to do that. If they want to. In Majesty 2 you cannot feel that atmosphere of being a king. It's more like an ordinary RTS game.Besides, despite advanced graphics, I like original Majesty art better. I mean buildings, characters etc. They were more authentic than in Majesty 2. Here we have some genereic medieval buldings and not a Rogue's guild or Temple of Krypta.When I'm playing the original Majesty, I always imagine myself as Vetinari, the patrician of Ankh-Morpork. Obviously the city, which I am building is Ankh-Morpork. Dunno, I always imagined Ankh-Morpork just like that.I would like to have sequel, which have art and AI of original Majesty. Not a generic gimped RTS.Nevertheless, if we look at this as a separate game and not a sequel, then it's pretty nice.Conclusion is: if you want some new experience in strategy games definitely get this. If you're an old-school fan of Majesty, then I don't think that you will like this, because it's lacks the atmosphere of original game. It's better for you to view this as a stand-alone game.

												The game is fun.  Well, it WAS fun until it stopped working properly. The issues with DRM and authentication are absurd and unacceptable. It is reasonable to expect to be able to play a product you have paid for and not be locked out of it because the developer is apparently no longer actively supporting it.Not recommended unless this nonsense gets fixed permanently.☠☠☠			",147,61,2,27,5,1,20

												I love this game. I have been playing the Majesty games for over a decade and I absolutely love them. Majesty 2 is definitely not as good as the original, but it has its pro's. For instance, it's way prettier. And I love playing as the bad guys in Monster Kingdom. All this is great, however, steam done ♥♥♥♥ed up. Again. When I bought this collection on amazon (5ish years ago), it was awesome. The game is still awesome, however the steam version is buggy. Enragingly buggy. For instance, crashing AS YOU WIN A MISSION AFTER TRYING IT FOR HOURS. Luckily, whenever I load up whenever this happens it save my campaign and it says I won the mission. Unfortunately, I am never able to pick the lord of the region (or whatever they call it) because it crashed after I win, not after I pick a hero to save. So that's horrible. Even more rageful, the last mission I played, I spent 3 hours trying to beat this level. I finally demolished every single character on the map (other than roaming ones from off the map). It wasn't letting me continue. I checked my quests and it said that one was incomplete... the quest said I had to kill this one Priestess of Agrella and her dwarven allies. I killed all of them. And I spent almost a half an hour searching for a dwarf that I may have missed. I revealed the entire map, and I was right, I killed ALL of them. So the mission derped and didn't recognized that I killed everything. So my game is pretty much trapped in a Majesty limbo. Do I play the entire level again, spend hours to possibly have it not register again? Considering that I cannot advance in the campaign without it, I don't have many options. Instead of spending hours doing it again when I already beat it, I'm leaving an angry review for Steam's lazy♥♥♥♥♥debugging and their  pitiful upkeep on the games they have.I have 104 games on steam. I'm a bit of a game hoarder and I love steam for what it is. However, I have noticed that they BUTCHER perfectly good and perfectly working games on the regular. It's moronic. Majesty 2 and Age of Mythology are, in my opinion, some of Steam's biggest letdowns.So yes, I recommend buying and playing this game (after you play Majesty 1). However, don't try buying and playing it on steam because it will make ANYONE rageful. Whether or not you are a fan of the series. I highly encourage you all to buy it from anywhere else, other than steam.To the steam people, stop royally screwing up my favorite games. It's utterly disgusting. If you want us versatile gamers (those of us who play a wide variety of games) to continue buying things from you, STOP ♥♥♥♥ING UP. This seems almost lazy. You take perfectly working games and somehow make them broken. It's fascinating and aggrivating. If you simply have too many games to make them all work well, then maybe make the games you have work at full capacity instead of offering twice as many broken games? I don't know how your system works and I truly love some of the things you provide- and I respect how much attention you give indie gamers. But this theme of half completed and half broken games is getting old. Not just to me but to everyone.			",35,4,0,10,22,2,24

												A unique spin on an RTS where you try to persuade heroes to attack a target. You control then indirectly, upgrading weapons, armor, and spells. You choose between different guilds to build, because some do hate each other.

												Been reading reviews with some people having difficulty playing and the game not starting/working at all. Bought the game anyway and it works. gameplay is nice since I played the very old version of this one years ago. Many people complain on game difficulty, but all you really need to do is think of a strategy from the start to beat a level. If you fail at first then replay the mission and think of what building to place and start to level your heroes until they can defend attacking monsters to your kingdom. Don't rush placing all buildings as it will spawn more waves of enemies and placing towers and upgrading is a must :) Players with little to no patience don't buy this.			",118,6,4,20,5,0,10

												Played the first in my youth and gameplay hasn’t changed one bit, this is the sequel to an excellent game. Be warned however unlike the original the difficulty gets very hard very quick and not hand holding in the early missions (some easy, some rock solid). The premise of the game being you build up your town and settlement like any other strategy game, recruit heroes and provide them with services. But these heroes go about doing what they will, buying your weapons and potions raiding monster dens etc. You can encourage them to do this by setting rewards for going certain places or destroying certain monster hideouts but in the end they choose.I should also warn you that the game, while not being extremely buggy, has some major issues with the DLC due to the developer no longer being around and a connection issue with a server no longer in operation. This means you may not get everything you were expecting, why this is still sold as it is on steam or why it hasn’t been fixed by the publisher is anyone’s guess, take your chances. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has so many things that will just make you want to punch your monitor. The first few levels are fun, but eventually you get to the dragon level and you have no chance in hell to have a level 1 character survive. The scripting is horrible and in no way could this have been play tested. So- you build a lord hall and parade out your Level 19 characters - and even those get killed - and not by the boss of the level, but by the random creatures (elemental placed right next to my town) in the game. And this isn't something that is a flaw in just that level. I saw this in each of the next levels also - of course I could only get to them with a money cheat, and at that point it isn't any fun anymore. I do love the concept of the game. I am now just hoping that someone else decides to write another type of game like this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its what it says on tin - Fantasy Kingdom Sim - or to translate its ""Theme Park"" genre :)You do not control units directly, you create infrastructure and hire your crew from asorted fantasy cliche. And influence theirs behaviour with creating reward flags. So for example you click on Wolf cave and write 500 gold reward to anyone who will help to destry it [This can be done with one powerfull hero or multiple weaker ones will party up to task and share]Every hero class have its personality, thief will go to suicide scout mission if price is right, wariors are likely to run into defense or clerics will much more likely participate in elimination of undeads and healing other heroesDo not be fooled though.Trough few tutorial missions seems easy and simple game becomes pretty hardcore later, still not its game where even multiple restarts do not frustrate me as its the way how to learn what and when to counter to survive in given scenario.Graphics and GUI is nice and well thought out so you do not have hard time to find what you need.

												This is probably one of my favorite games, with your strategy having to shift depending on the quest/scenario parameters - so you never end up developing a cookie-cutter strat that works for every scenario.  Yes, it means you may frequently have to a mission in order to refine your plan, but that's part of what makes it fun, and ultimately rewarding when you succeed.Although, I do admit, sometimes you really want to yell at your heroes for not doing exactly what you want them to, when you want them to!  But their varying response levels just add another dimension of challenge and resource management to the game.  Very addicting, entertaining, and delightful strategy/simulation game.  Plus the Advisor makes a great narrator, adding a sense of whimsy and fun.			",52,36,1,33,13,0,32

												Warlock won't make much sense unless you've played this.  Also the voice acting in Majesty 2 is way more funny than Warlock!I recommend the base game over the collection.  Why?  Because it does become tedious after a while.  The game pits ""thicker"" and thicker enemies, and once you understand the game mechanics it's just a matter of time to finish any board.  They get longer and longer.I don't think of that as more and more difficult - or more and more ___interesting___ - just more and more tedious.But the base game mechanic is still great, and there's a sense of humor on 2 levels: the voice acting is funny, but also it's funny to set a reward on some enemy who the adventurers are clearly not ready for and watch them all run in to their deaths.  :)  Also, seeing a level 30 skeleton wandering through town blasting everyone and they all go flying and screaming in the air!  Hilarious!!UPDATE1:  While there can optionally be randomized spawns per map, each scenario is a customized story complete with voice acting.  So there is a thread of continuity playing through the campaign which combined with the humor has better effect than other game campaigns.  I am somewhat motivated to dredge myself through the overly difficult levels just to see what story they came up with.  I think the dead bride skeleton king level sold me on the storytelling - it's not ad hoc moments of ""wow"" like might happen in a random map (say in a TBS) but a deliberate story being told.  I would have to finish all of them to make any comment on the quality of the story, but the humor does go a long way for making the experience memorable.UPDATE2:  .. and... there's the music.  I loved the music in Warlock - it was some of the best I think I had ever heard in a TBS.  And now that same theme song plays here.  Great song!			",40,9,2,27,29,1,32

												I've never heard of Majesty 2 until the recent steam sale.  I'm a fan of real time and turn based strategy games and I must say that I've thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.  Just finished the original and kingmaker campaigns, it sure was fun.Don't think multiplayer works for this game but singleplayer is great.  In 64 hours of gameplay it has crashed on me only once.  So can't say it has many bugs.  The game is nicely polished and has good graphics for its age.  Haven't played Majesty 1, the graphics there are a bit of a turn off unfortunately, although many people think the gameplay of the older version is better.The campagn missions can be very difficult but they are beatable.  The increasing difficulty pushes you to explore the game more and read up on some strategies if you get really stuck.  When you are finally able to beat that difficult mission,  like the Rat King or The Avatar, then it feels really satisfying :)  With the Rat King mission I built a mage guild and then a wizard tower and kept activating it to protect my warriors until they levelled up.Economy is very important in this game, try to position your marketplace next to a trade post and then build a tower next to the market so the tax collector doesn't have very far to walk.   Group your economic buildings like the blacksmith and the potions bazaar next to that tower as well.There are a variety of strategies available with each mission.  You can create 'tanking' groups of 3 clerics + 1 dwarf.  Although groups don't seem to retreat as well as individual heroes.  Rangers are a good early to mid game option.  Some players build the Hall of Lords straight away.  Some of the cheap lords like levelled up Rogues and Rangers can be very useful in the early game and mid game, and that's usually the most crucial time.  A levelled up lord is not always the best option, it may be better to have lower level templars with good weapons so they are cheaper to buy.  And so on a so forth.  Sure the first game may have more options but Magesty 2 also offers alot of good gameplay so I think this game is sometimes rated unfairly, because it is a great game.  And if its on sale then its definitely worth it :)			",27,1,1,12,9,0,31

												An Excellenet Strategy Game where you have to manage the kingdom instead of managing the people directly.  I hope they come out with a Third Installment where the AI is somewhat more sophisticated and you slowly have more and more buildings and possibly more updward and downward levels to build into.Just an excellent game and the expansion is COMPELTELY different, the Monster Kingdom is a HUGE game, almost like a complete 3rd game.

The service the game uses to verify and authorize it is no longer running and Paradox doesn't seem to be able to work around this either.I might not write the game off completely, but be aware that much of the content here may simply not work, and if it doesn't, there won't be anything you can do to fix it.

												Hard as nails and unbalanced without mods and some optional editing yourself to adjust some things.  Apart from that a very good RTS game except your units all have free will but you can tempt them to attack/move with flags and gold. They will also upgrade themselves at shops and so on. Lovely game.PS. Since gamespy has shut down I don't think multiplayer works but worth it alone for the single playerEdit: If memory serves I used this then you can also edit it yourself with notepad++ (file to edit shops.set) https://esatire.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/majesty-2-is-actually-fun-now-thanks-to-modding/2nd Edit 2017: DLC seems to no longer work and requires this fix https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/majesty-2-collector-dlc-fix.983538/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some changes from Majesty 1, of which a lot of my childhood was spent playing.Improved AI: You can use this to cheese any map, as your peasants actually repair things in Majesty 2, hero AI is a lot better, with heroes making better choices. With new flags like guarding, you never have to worry about a skeleton ruining your entire economy because it got lucky and killed the caravan carrying much needed gold.Stronger guards: Palace and guard tower guards can now stand toe to toe with moderately strong enemies. Tax collectors seem much happier in this game. Arrows come with the guard tower, no need to spend gold researching them.Stronger classes in general: Mages and Rangers no longer die in 1-2 hits from rats anymore, clerics not only do actual damage, but they are even harder to kill than before. Mages do not have the extreme overkill capacity as they did in Majesty 1 if they survived to level 10, but they make up for it with better defenses / ai / and utility (freezing enemies). Elves have been buffed to the point of being useful unless you have to go with dwarves to fight early dragon onslaughts.Skeletons now reliably killable by level 1 Warriors: Skeletons are no longer magic resist / dodge gods and for the player, dwarves have taken their place for fighting strong magic monsters like dragons.Parties: You can now assign 4 heroes to a party. This allows you to tactically place your clerics where they need to be, and generally makes your heroes almost invulnerable.Enemy spawn rates increased: If you do not plan accordingly, you can have your low level heroes die to hordes of rats and skeletons while your better heroes are off doing the objective. Guard towers fix this problem easily, but I like to keep them to a minimum so that my heroes can level up and acquire gold for upgrades.More upgrades: Your casters now gain magic attack when they upgrade their weapons, and every class has a plethora of upgrades to purchase.I've read many reviews saying this game is too difficult. Without spoiling too much, learn the strengths and weaknesses of the heroes and learn how to set up and properly defend your economy, if your tax collectors die, you get no gold. Do not overlook palace upgrades. Remember your build orders so you can try something different if you fail. ",48,4,0,9,8,1,14

												Fun yet flawed, Majesty 2 has kept the charm of the original, but has fixed few of its problems. There is some dwarf-fortressy enjoyable frustration in not being able to control your little citizens, but less enjoyable is the finicky building placement, the absurd costs of ressurecting expensive heroes with all the self preservation of a snowball in hell, and the very uneven difficulty of the campaign missions. Part of me really wants to reccomend this game, but it just has too many warts.			",32,4,0,31,19,1,43

												Seeing so many negative reviews its a shame I can't add my review to Majesty 2 since I own the Collection edition. So here will suffice. I rate this game 8.5/10 and I played the original Majesty too (rate:9/10). M2 is a sim  RTS+RPG game, Like RTS games you have create an economy, research, create armies and destroy the opponents. The sim part is because you don't control the units (caled heroes). You assign rewards to kill a monster or destroy a building and depending on the reward 0 or more of your heroes will go achieve your task (more money = more heroes). There are soe 5 different kinds of tasks you can assign to heroes. The heroes will buy themselves upgrades provided that you created the necessary buildings and invested  on the research (which cost gold). Placing the buildings is your task and its important. There are defense towers and many other kinds of buildings (15+). Heroes level as they gain more experience (RPG component). I love this whole concept of the Majesty series. Plus points:- Unique take on RTS- A variety of heroes: gnomes, archers, paladins, monks, necromancers (some 15+ types)- Rock-paper-scissors system. .- Varied gameplay in the campaign. - RPG element s great. You can check each of your heroes and see what spells/powers they have learned.- Game is well polished.Minus points:- Some of the latter missions are way too difficult. Basically, large number of monsters are thrown on your base before you even got the chance to set your economy. This frustrates the last 1/3 of the campaign. The first 2/3 are great. Its a shame. Maybe they should have add difficulty levels.- So there are cheats and the player is forced to either spend hours figuring out how to beat each of these later missions or use the cheats, which is a shame either way.- The concept is so amazing, one can't help feel that they could have designed a better campaign. One of the (hard) missions is to defeat two opposing kingdoms. It is incredibly cool as each of the opponents is using different armies. They could have thought other missions like that.

												First of all im sry for my bad english. 2. I give some hints in this recommendation, may help u a lot on your wayIf u love challenging strategy games, this is your choice!the gameplay is quite unique, since you cant control your heroes (units) directly, you have to use your signal flags as often as you canI played this game some years ago, i buyed the Majesty 2 Collection with all 3 dlcsthe main-campaign is about 10-15 hours, depends on how fast you continue and how often u may fail!all in all i got around 30-35 hours to complete all campaigns. There are still a lot of ""scenario""-mapsSince this game is very challenging, there are some fast hints for u:- use your flags a lot, since they are your only way to get some controll over your heroes! they also give some money to your heroes, they need it!- invest in your heroes, seriously, they grow stronger and stronger the more you feed them with signal-flags- if you dont know what heroes to choose as your ""lords"", you can hire 3 in every game, and ""save"" 1 per game, i recommend you to get Thiefs! Thiefs are your key to win! Try to get at least 2 high-lvld thiefs with some awesome equipment, they are extremely cheap. High lvld they almost never die and they are badass killing the most units 1v1! And they have Stun!- Since every hero fits into his own role ""warrior = tank"" ""assasin - melee-dps"" ""Ranger = ranged-dps, good against animals"" ""cleric=healer, undead-killer"" ""mage= ranged-dps, AOE-monster"" it seemes to be pretty good to get at least 1 guild of all kind. It is, BUT:here is where the math comes in: dont worry, i do the math for u ;)if you afford a Ranger-Guild, it costs you 450 Gold, if you get a second Ranger guild it gets more expensive = 650 goldu can Upgrade the ranger-Guild 2 times, 250 gold and 500 gold = 750 goldthere are at all 3 Skill-Upgrades, 200 gold + 1k + 1k makes 2200 Goldall in all, all Ranger-Upgrades costs u a total of around 2950 Gold!2950 Gold - 200 gold from the increased guild-cost = 2750 Gold you SAVE with your 2. Ranger-Guild. Thats a whole lot of money! u can also get a 3. Ranger guild and still save an additionall ~ 2500 GoldU only have to upgrade 1 Ranger-Guild to improve ALL your Rangers!Same with all other guildsMages=there are one of the most awesome dps-monsters in this games, a high-lvld mage can kill groups of strong enemys, mostly single-handed! But its really hard to get them strong and ofc they are pretty expensive if u decide to get mages, get them very early in game, and lvl them to lvl 5 as soon as possible!! with lvl 5 they get a mana-shield which makes them much StrongerI also recommend to have at least 1 high-lvld mage as a Lordhere we goGood Luck & Have Fun guys! :)			",66,1,0,24,19,0,33

												A sequel to an amazing game. However, the sequel itself is okay at its best. Even though the balancement issues are glaring, a huge difficulty creep is present and the AI is dead set on being pretty dumb at times, it's still a pretty fun semi-strategy game to play through. Just make sure to have lots, and lots of patience.Should also note that the game, whilst not being extremely buggy, IS pretty buggy when it comes to the DLC in it. There is a particularly bad bug that renders most of the DLC in this useless, and the company has stopped trying to fix the issue at this point. Take that as you will.Edit: There IS a DLC fix! http://steamcommunity.com/app/73020/discussions/0/215439774859366240/ ",114,10,2,10,8,2,3

												I'm writing this review because It bothers me how little notoriety majesty getsMajesty 1 and Majesty 2 are both incredibly entertaining games that have value that long outlives their price point. Don't let my hours played fool you. I owned these games before steam was so common place and have likely sunk over 100 hours into Majesty 1 and at least 70 or so into Majesty 2.But what is the game like? Well, Majesty is an RTS game yes, but it is best described as being god of your own little fantasy MMORPG. Your units in the game act on their own free will, and you must tempt them to do deeds for the kingdom by setting up quests for them to accomplish in the game by way of bounties. It's an unusual system, that can occassionally be difficult to get the hang of, but once you do it feels natural.Like players in an MMO your units will level up, learn skills, & go to the shops and buy potions, weapons, armor, and whatever magic trinkets your market might have for sale. One of them might even get lucky and come across an extremely powerful weapon early in the game and go on to become a powerful lord of your land, valliantly defending against hordes of creatures that instantly wipe out your younger units, giving them breathing room to grow in power.I could ramble on for much longer about why I love this game, but I'll try to throw together a good old fashion pro's and cons list Pro's:-Beautiful fantasy art style and graphics. Every unit in the game looks great right from the start, but as they level up and purchase new weapons and armor their appearance changes in a satisfying and meaningful way. A level 1 warrior looks like nothing compared to a level 15 warrior.-Combat, while not being super involved on the part of the player, is always satsifying and fun to watch. As your units learn new skills either from training at a guild, or from leveling up, the way they fight changes. It's always neat to see the heroes fighting in new ways as the game goes on.-Intimidating monsters and quests that will challenge you. Because of the unusual method for defending your kingdom, it's not nearly so easy to defend in this game. Bunkering up with thousands of troops is not something you can do, so proper management is something you'll have to learn-Great silly voice acting from the royal advisor, and many good lines from your units. The dialog is just fun, that's all there really is to say about that.-Economics are easy to grasp, not spreadsheet material, but not♥♥♥♥♥♥easy either. You will run out of money, and you will suffer for it, but you wont need a college degree to figure out how to maintain your kingdom.Con's:-The game is hard, and if you've never played a majesty game before, then you're going to have a bit of a rough time starting out (Though for some this can easily be a pro)-It's frontloaded. Many missions are only hard at the start. By the time you establish your kingdom and have several powerful heroes wandering around, you'll easily take the rest of the mission by storm. (This is more of a problem with the vanilla campaign, and not so much with the DLC's)-Takes forever to unlock everything. You will have to complete over 70% of the in game missions to have every building and unit unlocked. This can be frustrating if your favorite unit or building is one of the very last to be unlocked. -AI is sometimes very stupid. Generally your units will do fine without your guidance and only need you to give them a quest for something majorly out of the way, like to raid an enemy keep, or defend a trading post. But sometimes a unit will choose to go to the store when a lich is about to blow their house to smithereens, and....well that is annoying.			",122,49,0,25,14,1,18

												I used to play majesty 1 when i was a kid with my friend. Lots of good times and a fun game it was backthen. You cannot control heroes directly so that was very different if you compare it to games like warcraft and command&conquer. I bought both of these games now on a sale. I actually didnt know there was a majesty 2, but wanted to give it a try. Its ok game, but it doesnt feel like ""the majesty"". If you havent played neither one, i would recommend the first one. It is not 3d, but graphics are still cool (Majesty gold HD version), sounds are surprisingly good too. Its faster and a lot of small things are different and ""better"" i would say. Both are pretty cheap atm so you just might grab 'em both and try.			",16,1,0,1,2,0,4

												Oh my! This game is amazing!Finally some nerve requiring game in this simple times. Of course it's dificult, it's an old school game when things had to be difficult because developers couldn't afford to make 300 maps and people tend to think a little more to beat a level.And that's not a bad thing too, latelly all games are just way too easy, people get frustrated for not 'being able' to ditch lvl 245 of Candy Crush (wich doesn't require much puzzle solving thinkin, in my personal opinion). Over Majesty, you'll have to think outside the box to win some of these levels, and it's just logic! The game wants to beat you the same way you want to beat the game!So buckle up and get ready to use your most important body muscle!Played before and played now and loved all the way!

												This game is great.Kingdom RTS, but you don't directly control units. For example:You build a warrior -> Warrior embarks out on his own to look for quests -> Warrior accumulates money and levels up -> if you build a blacksmith then the warrior uses his money to purchase better weapons -> You then tax the blacksmith and the economy circulates.Do this with all sorts of different warriors. You build the kingdom at home and the units go out and do their own thing. Pretty addicting.			",48,5,1,9,21,0,27

												Ok not entirely sure how to review this. On the one hand it is challenging and can be fun but on the other it can be unbelieveably frustrating with some level design that is so shockingly bad some of the levels are literally impossible unless you retry them 20+ times. The thing is most levels are tough but ultimately fair, if you play them correctly you win. However there are 2 levels very early on where you can literally lose before you have the chance to do anything. I'm not exagerrating with that, your builders can all be killed before you even construct your first building and you have no chance the rebuild. The dragon mission is like that too, sometimes the dragon comes and does nothing, other times it will come and kill all your builders AND destroy the buildings before you have built them. This is extremely stupid level design as you lose before you start. On top of that there is the extremely annoying bug that can cause the game to crash WHICH CORRUPTS THE SAVE! Yep, that one time you do survive and get a save, the game loses it. I cannot begin to describe how insanely idiotic and frustrating that is.You then have cases of heroes being stupid, a hero that is a high level will happily walk past a bunch of enemies tearing your base to pieces despite being more than capable of killing the lot with minimal effort. The paying money to influence hero actions is a good system but let down by the atrocious AI and the fact you can't refund a flag you placed if you change your mind, once the flag is placed the money is stuck to it permenantly rather than losing it upon the completion of the task.All this is a shame because the fundamental idea behind the game is interesting and it would be nice to see it remade. Having said that I cannot recommend this game just because the rat king and dragon missions (which you can't skip) are so SO♥♥♥♥♥♥poor and frustrating that you will be lucky to see the rest of the game without giving up and uninstalling. If those 2 missions were fixed to actually be fair then I'd recommend this as a fun game, all the other missions are acceptable.TL;DR 2 very poorly designed levels (ie impossible 90% of the time) and stupid AI ruin an otherwise interesting and challenging game. Avoid unless you have the patience of a saint.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A unique mix of Warcraft-ish ( or the much-forgotten Warlords style ) RTS and a simulation game. You can give instructions to your peasants to create buildings . You can hire heroes and upgrades from buildings ( AoE like system ).  However, you cannot control the heroes directly . They are like simulated RPG players  going on quests ( if the reward seems interesting enough ) , and gaining experience and levels as they defeat enemies.Not interest in playing this in multi-player mode ( I doubt if anyone is playing this anymore ) , but the campaign is a lot of fun, and does require quite a few map resets , and loading at critical saves. Good ol' style strategy fun . Got the base game in one of the humblebundles , and upgraded to the collection coz I enjoyed the campaign a lot . Holds enough replayability if you start randomizing maps.			",277,73,6,53,40,5,86

												An otherwise decent game marred by having almost all of its difficulty front loaded within the first 10 minutes of each mission. You are immediately beset by EVERYTHING at the beginning of every mission.. if you can survive it and build up your heroes, then the game is a cakewalk. Would give the game a 7/10, if not for the Rat King mission. That mission alone drops it to 5/10. Not a bad game, but not worth the frustration.			",98,18,0,47,23,2,37

												Second iteration of one of my favorite games of all times... I still use the expressions of the characters of the heroes in the original Majesty and probably will forever. In many ways it is much like the first one, with the addition of the Hero party system (which is extremely helpful: you can party up your strongest characters and pwn). You also get artifacts that can be used in future missions, there's new flags, improved multiplayer, and of course much better in terms of it's engine, graphics, and physics. If you loved the first one (and got it with your old Gateway like I did) you'll play the hell out of this one.			",41,3,0,1,3,0,3

I gave it a try and fell in love instantly.Now this is the sequel of the old Majesty. It has almost all of its predecessor's features plus new ones. Do you think that a monster is too powerful for your heroes? Gather them in a party of adventurers and united they can defeat tougher enemies. I love the trading posts as well, they can give you a huge income. The new flags, one for defending a unit or area, and one to keep away your heroes from a monster or area.The graphics is cute. Not great, no eyecandies, but it is cute.I recommend it to anyone who liked the original one or would like to try a new way of RTS games.(Sorry for my english)			",14,1,0,8,4,0,14

												Real fun, most of the people hate the changes made in Majesty 2 but I really couldn't play the first one, not only because of the dated graphics but because the UI in majesty 2 is much much better. The ""flag rewards"" are all on one hud, so is the palace button, the buildings are organized in categories, etc. So what is Majesty 2? You essentially build your kingdom, recruit some heroes and give away some bounties. Heroes will decide if they want to goof around, do some adventuring on their own (very rare but possible), maybe do some shopping in the blacksmith you upgraded for them (and hey, if they spend money, you get it back with taxes) or just follow your ""bounties"". That's right, you don't control them, but you can tell them ""Hey I'll pay you 300 gold for taking out that wolves' den"". In Majesty 2 you can make parties too, seems strange that a King should concern itself with it, but hey, better me than a stupid AI, so you make your parties balanced and off you go for adventure.Haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I heard Internet servers are down and only LAN can be played, but anyway, I really like this game, there is enough rpg elements like abilities, levels, equips, stats for your heroes to love the customization and rts elements (more like city management rts but yeah). The last great part about this, which is highly personal, is that the game is in Ardania, the fantasy world and culture that I learned to love through Warlock - Master of the Arcane. All the bad rewievs didn't give me much hope for this game, but it's awesome, mods heavily recommended (they balance quite some things, I use Majesty 2 Reloaded).			",432,86,11,64,48,1,72

												Fantasy kingdom strategy game where you build your town and motivate your cash driven heroes. You do this by setting rewards for tasks like exploring, killing enemies and destroying nests. Can get a bit challenging at times but is very enjoyable nonetheless.			",858,248,48,82,113,12,198

												$20 bucks for hours of gameplay. Relatively quick to play for many maps making it a good one when you've just got an hour of so. Pretty much unique as far as games go; I don't know of anything else like Majesty.Downsides: Later campaigns are hard and I generally just play the single map scenarios after a certain point. Monster Kingdom can only be played in campaign mode, which is a shame.			",84,16,2,26,48,0,34

												Love this game.  The original Majesty was one of the first computer games I ever played and its sequel lives up to my memories of the original.  The gameplay is awesome, but can get repetitive after 40 hours of play.  Thankfully there are tons of levels and scenarios which each offer new challenges.Seriously though.  Goblin experts are annoying as hell.			",67,25,0,11,21,0,20

												I have played this game for a decent amount of hours now, and I must say the critique of it 'not being as good as the original' is unfair judgement. Yes, Majesty was a good game, but no, Majesty 2 isn't a dissapointing sequel by no stretch of the word. What this game has done is reliven an old game, and add some new difficulty and strategy which will leave you frustrated, thinking upon new ideas to beat the levels, and saying to yourself 'just one more try' at 2am in the morning.I personally think the best thing about this game, is by far the expansions. Monster Kingdom added a new depth and level of play for me, and I loved the idea of facing previous allies as your previous enemy.So, all in all, before I write an essay, I would reccomend this game. If you want a harder challenge than the original posed, then download it and have some fun.			",8,1,0,3,2,0,3

												Game is broken, big chunk of DLC unaccessable. DO NOT BUY!  Paradox strikes again!Edit: I have been directed to a fan made patch which appears to fix the majority of DLC related issues. Servers and internet options still down/broken but this workaround appears legitimate. Link to the patch is in comments for this review.I am leaving the review negative though as being required to download a fan patch for basic game functionality is NOT cool and the fact that it can be fixed yet Paradox has done nothing in some ways makes it worse. At least people who already own this can play it now. If you are considering this as a purchase make sure the workaround is still available for download and decide if you still want this game or not.			",113,40,0,43,6,0,4

												This is nice lil RTS not like any I've played in my past not sure how I missed this lil gem over my 30 year gaming career. You don't directly control any of your units the a.i. controls them but you tell them what to attack sorta it's more like bribe them to lol you spend gold to set rewards for there objectives they get reward you gave them then things to buy in the markets and blacksmiths so you get the gold back eventually lol it reminds me of the sims or a tycoon game in away you give them the things to do they will do it. Think of the gold rewards as priorities higher the reward faster they will do something if you set reward to 100 and then set a rward on same type of attack at 500 they will go for the one has the most pay out. I never felt a learning curve with the game but I am an old school gamer and huge RTS political ecomomic genre player so I understood what was what by time i got to the end of tutorial missions.I'd highly recommend this game for RTS and grand stratgy players maybe even 4x lovers also tycoon and sims lovers might indeed enjoy this lil gem. I picked the game up from a sale worth $5 worth $10 to $20 maybe to me not worth $20 though.			",328,34,12,43,15,0,54

												I like this game as its a very interesting combination of RTS and City Sim. You don't actually control your units but instead build a kingdom to attract, equip and power-up heroes who go on ""quests"" that you ""sponsor"". You also can gain many different spells to directly influence the battle.There are many hero types and they all have certain personality types that effects how they behave i.e. rangers love to scout the map and rogues are easy to bribe to get them to do anything. Game is HARD though so if you are the type to give up or become frustrated easily then you may want to pass.			",244,33,5,58,32,1,65

												A small scale empire builder where you have no direct control over your units. The closest you get are bounties you can set to have them attack enemies/buildings, defend buildings/caravans, explore an area, or stay away from something they are in no way ready to handle. As the king, you decide what gets built, what heroes get hired, things to research and upgrade, and are allowed to spend some of your cash on spells for more influence on the course of the game. Unfortunately, just like the first game, this one suffers from the problem of needing to be lucky for the first few minutes and hope that the den of mini-dragons that can kill every hero in one attack doesn't decide to send a wave towards you before you've even built a single barrack or guard tower. But the times when you don't get imediately ♥♥♥♥ed from the start are what make the game great. Do you invest in upgrading the rouges guild so that all your heroes have their weapons poisoned? Maybe build a guard tower next to the sewer entrance so that the ratmen that come from it don't ravage your marketplace? Or do you research better spells, equipment, and potions for your heroes to use? Coming to forkroads like that  and then playing them out to see if you made the right choice are what gives the game so much character, if you can bear the 10 failed attempts beforehand where a boss teir dragon decided to attack your palace as soon as you loaded the level.

												Amazing game! Anyone that has played the original majesty will fall head over heels for this. It's an RTS that doesn't actually let you control your troops. It's more like you are the king and you see all that happens in your kingdom, order buildings to be constructed, set bounties to ENCOURAGE your troops(A.K.A. heroes)to do things like attack enemy buildings, protect your own buildings or explore a certain spot. It's an actually difficult game that takes a lot more concentration and strategy than you would first think. However there are multiple different stages that can be played and you can improve your strategy, rhythm by doing so. Something cool that was added in for Majesty 2 is the idea of the lords: for each land(or territory or stage whatever you wanna call them) that you conquer, you can ""hire"" one of the heroes you got there to be a lord. They keep whatever eqipment, experience and spells they aquire when you use them and you can hire them again on the other stages for a price. Better yet, there is no money sink. Once you have bought the game, you can buy expansions, but you don't have anything like ""magic gems"" to buy a load of in-game crap. Once you have the game, it's all you: skill, determination, and strategy will help you win.			",2,1,0,11,5,0,11

												I first played this game back in 2010 or so. Since I hadn't played the original at that time I really enjoyed the gameplay and even though the missions got really difficult, it felt good to complete them after trying for so long (with a couple of boosts). I recently rediscovered it when I downloaded the game on my phone and found that there were expansion packs for the PC version. So I decided to buy the collection (since it was on sale for only $5) and I am so happy I did so. Even though the developers seemed to have encoded the game save files to prevent any cheating techniques that people used, making the game a little more challenging, trying to find the ideal formula to win is still enjoyable. That being said, there are still a couple more hacks that you can use to make things a little easier. The only issue that I have is that the DLC isn't available because of the broken content but I'm still happy with all the missions that I get in this collection for only $5 so I'm not complaining too much. I also don't know why people seem to have a lot of trouble with running the game on windows 10. Even though its a little slow (and that's probably because i'm using a pretty old and weak laptop), everything seems to be working fine. I really do wish there were more games like this out there. I don't enjoy controlling more than one character at a time because I tend to get too focused on something and forget the others.			",1,0,0,0,2,0,1

												Unique gameplay style however it will get repetitive. It is also very hard as in impossible or unfair as there is no difficulty. I do appreciate difficult games however replaying the same level not finding the solution is a bit annoying. My biggest praise is in the requirement for units to level up and gain abilities as the game progresses. However for the campaign you are limited to three heroes you can take per level so it kind of falls short on progressing into creating a formidable force. Its major downfall is its repetitiveness. While watching the heroes run around doing their jobs and level is fun, it is the same build and gameplay strategy for most of the levels. It was fun for the first couple of days but watching your units grind away is a bit boring after a while. I would only recommend if you are a fan of the game or are looking for a different gameplay style.			",114,23,1,13,20,1,32

-Quick Review-Majesty 2 Collection is a real time strategy fantasy kingdom simulator, much like it's predecessor, Majesty. However Majesty 2 was developed by a new developer: 1C:Ino-Co. I don't have any other comments on the developer, I just wanted to highlight that this game has a different developer.Majesty 1 was developed by Paradox Interactive and released in 2000, Majesty 2 was developed by 1C:InoCo and released in Apr 19, 2011.


So Far, So good...

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: *impersonates the Majesty Crier* (it's like a Sean Connery impersonation which George Ledoux does) ""Welcome Majesty, it's been some time since we've last met, probably about 10 years. Many things have changed, some changes are good, some changes are bad, but change they have.""Text doesn't really sell the impersionation, but one of the staples of the Majesty series was definitely the voice antics of George Ledoux, who voiced the Royal Advisor, Venn Fairweather.As the story goes, the realm has had years and years of peace, and suddenly something stirs up your old enemies again and you need to return to the battlefield to protect your people.Seeing as this is the Majesty 2 COLLECTION, you're also picking up some DLC with the core game; Majesty 2 (The core game), Kingmaker expansion , Battles of Ardania expansion , Monster Kingdom expansion. Naturally each expansion has it's own twist on the Majesty 2 Narrative. My personal favorite was the Monster Kingdom expansion because you find yourself making an alliance with your previous enemies. For once, *I* was the one summoning hordes of rats and goblins! Payback is sweat.

Gameplay: Not to re-invent the wheel, but if you want a better break down for the majesty game-play mechanics I highly suggest checking out my Majesty 1 review, I'll add a link at the end of this review. The quick explanation for anyone who hasn't played Majesty before: You set various flags with bounties which your hero's will either: Attack, explore, or defend. Depending on the flag you set.You also control the buildings you can construct, and can cast several spells, but only if you have the gold to lay the foundation for a building, or cast a spell. So there's a type of fantasy economy going on in the game. You build a marketplace which sells potions, Hero ""mynameismud"" walks into the marketplace you made, buys some potions, your tax collector walks by, picks up the taxes, returns to your castle, BAM now those coins are in youre treasury which you can use to upgrade your marketplace.There are different objectives and goals depending on the mission you're playing, as you progress you unlock more difficult missions which will have special conditions, sometimes you can only use a certain type of unit, other times you cannot construct something, other times you need to explore to discover the neccessary item/unit/guild/building.Contrasting Gameplay from Majesty 1 to Majesty 2: The gameplay at surface level doesn't seem to have changed very much from the days of Majesty 1... but the game definitely feels different. Somehow the only way I can describe the game is ""....more difficult"". which doesn't seem like a very fair criticism. Majesty 2 feels more fast paced, and less forgiving if you mess up. It also feels like you need to do what I loving call ""over building"" more then I did in Majesty 1.So basically my strategy has always been ""Build as much as you can as early as possible, build enough hero's to keep your servants safe while they construct your money making buildings, then proceed to build the lowest costing guilds moving forward. So if I have 5 ranger guilds, I'll build some rogue guilds, and then warrior, then come back to ranger guilds when the price is lower then the other guilds.You never really felt like you had very much control in Majesty 1, so the fact that I feel like I don't have much control in Majesty 2 doesn't really phase me, but something just doesn't feel quite balanced in Majesty 2. It doesn't take away of my enjoyment for the game, but some people will definitely be put off by it.


This game can be just as Rage enducing as the first Majesty game.

Conclusion: In conclusion... I'm biased for this game. I strongly suggest taking my opinion with a grain of salt when considering if you should play this game or not. I adored Majesty Gold Edition, even replaying the game I started playing and beating hard missions because I just adored the gameplay and had a knack for playing it.Majesty 2 is quite different though, the spirit of the game is kept pretty well, but the changes will rattle most avid Ardania fans. I can't recommend Majesty 2 to everyone like I can for Majesty 1 (Seriously, go try that game out if you haven't, it's so good!) But for those of you who might have an idea what you're getting into, this game could have been WAY worse, trust me, I played Lords of the Realm III recently.Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read my review for the Majesty 2 Collection. I hope to take this game on as a video review sometime, but until that time. My name is Atratzu, and I approve this review.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update November 14, 2016:My Majesty: Gold Edition Review: https://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/25990/ ",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												On it's own merits, it's a unique game as far as strategy games go. It's not like most strategy games where you build a base and recruit a bunch of units, although it's similar. Instead you build guilds and hire heroes, who have their own unique AI patterns they follow and can't be directly controlled, only influenced by the player. Essentially this means the game is more of a simulation with the player playing the part of a quest giver for a typical RPG, with some town building aspects thrown in. You direct heroes with reward bounties for defending, attacking, or exploring whatever you put the bounty on. This costs you gold, which then goes into the heroes pockets, which they then use to buy equipment for further adventuring.This is a bit of a mixed bag. You rely on the AI to choose what to do, so your heroes might pick fights they can't win, run from fights they can win, ignore bounty targets with bounties that are too low, or put off buying better equipment to buy potions instead.It's arguable whether or not this game is better than the original, but it does have a lot of a quality of life improvements over the original. Heroes are always available to be brought back from the dead and the Hall of Lords can be used to recruit already leveled up heroes from past missions. Additionally there is a party system that allows you to have heroes group together. However hero AI is a bit simplified. Heroes don't wander off on their own as much as in the first game, and rarely have unique AI quirks such as the Ranger from the first game exploring on his own. This can make the game feel a bit less alive compared to the first game. The temple system  has been reworked as well. Now both temples and trading posts are built in specific spots on the map. This simplifies things, but also somewhat limits strategy in comparison to the first game.This version also comes with a lot of extra DLC missions. Including a neat and hilarious DLC campaign that has you using monster heroes instead of the typical human ones. Perhaps the funniest part of that DLC is the vampire tax collectors, who will actually attempt to defend themselves when attacked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game a while back during a huge sale period and just finally got around to playing it.  Boy do I regret waiting.  It's an incredibly fun and interesting take on a medieval fantasy RTS. Rather than command troops, you command peasants and set up bounties to encourage champions to go slay beasts or destroy dens or explore the map for you.It's ridiculously fun and time flies playing it.

												The gameplay of Majesty 2 is much like the original, with just a bit more control and alot more humor. You still cannot directly control your heroes, but they appear much more responsive to reward flags. The game feels more challenging with higher level, more difficult monsters appearing sooner and more frequently. Objectives are also not always the clearest after each campaign briefing, but by the time you get your kingdom running you will get the gist.Plays and feels quite a bit like the first Majesty game, and so was exactly what I was looking for. It is an enjoyable, fairly simple mechanics kingdom sim. Not neccessarily a 'serious' game, just something to have some fun with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I played the original Majesty as a kid. I never knew there was a squeal until about a two weeks ago. Of course I had to buy it. Overall, it's a decent game. My only complaints come from being so in love with the original. The AI seems a little iffy. Your heros don't act anything like they did in the original. In my opinion, it is a lot harder to get them to venture aware from your starting area. Also - in the original you were able to follow your heros around very very easily. In this version it is a lot more disjointed.Overall, I would say that the original is better. But if you are really interested - $20 isn't a bad price and you will probably get your moneys worth in the end.			",50,3,0,12,29,0,6

												A decent reinterpretation of an older game, but with all the polish stripped off and some excruciatingly unfun stage design.  The copy/pasted description on every class change (expecting something that describes what the change entails?  Too bad!) literally has a typo on the very first letter, and several of the levels consist of the player being buried under an endless tide of constantly-spawning enemies with no ability to construct buildings, hire units, or in fact do anything other than watch his kingdom burn down again and again until the RNG decides he's allowed to actually play.  Go play the first game instead.			",59,10,0,13,2,0,13

Strategy meets RPGA very nice blend of RTS, RPG and economic game. You are the ruler of Ardania, Fantasy Kingdom. You construct the guilds, economic buildings, research better weapons and shields. But you cannot control your heroes directly. They are controlled by setting rewards for specific goals like exploring a territory or killing a monster.There is a variety of missions and quests, some of which require attacking specific places or killing a monster which requires certain strategy. Others require simultaneous construction of some temples or defending a merchant caravan.""Majesty 2"" has nice, colorful 3D fantasy graphics and music which sets the mood really nice (with some beautifully epic pieces for final monster fights). There is a huge choice of hero classes like warriors, wizards, rogues, clerics, paladins and nice selection of monsters with their dwellings including vampire crypts, elemental portals and wolf dens.The game has a unique style merging some qualities of ""Heroes of Might and Magic"", some of ""Age of Empires"" and others from RPG games. Many missions are really demanding. I needed to consult strategy guides to finish some of the levels, but even after reading a strategy guide you can find your unique tactics to defeating the boss. After 25 hours of playing I have finished this really enjoyable game.			",157,83,9,22,24,1,41

												I think that this game was attempting to make a kingdom building game where armies are replaced by heroes to be sent on quests to deal with threats and scout locations. What they ended up with is a real time strategy game where your armies can't be controlled and only sometimes deals with threats. This game is entirely built upon luck and RNG. Sometimes a werewolf attacks too early and murders every hero in one hit, which spawns a graveyard which spawns skeletons and other undead. Now you have no heroes, a werewolf, and skeletons attacking the town. Other maps are supposed to have bosses you deal with after doing certain quests, but no they'll spawn right away before you get any hero buildings up and you'll lose in about 2 minutes of starting the map. Other maps will send a huge number of monsters before you can get hero buildings.Reading old posts from the original Majesty 2 forums show the last thing the developers did was stop trainers from working and the editing of some files to prevent cheating, but did nothing regarding the clearly broken nature of the game. One developer post from 2013 said that there was a problem with the DLC that would get fixed ""soon"". Three years later and it hasn't. This game appears to be for all intents and purposes abandoned which is strange because they've been jacking off the Ardania world for every drop.			",336,37,6,48,72,3,69

												 The mission designs for this game are mind bogglingly aweful. After the initial maps (which are enjoyable), you are placed into scenarios where you will have multiple enemy spawn points within view of your keep and they WILL spawn monsters before you get your first building completed. You will attempt to get buildings erected but your pesants will get killed (slowing or stopping construction), or the buildings will be attacked (slowing down or destroying your construction and wasting your gold), your tax collectors will get killed as they make their rounds (delaying or halting your income), and your heroes will constantly get mobbed (forcing them to hide in the guild hall for healing and be ineffective, or they'll die), dead heroes cause a graveyard to spawn nearby (which also spawns more monsters), etc...Administrative style games (where you do not have direct control of your units) requre a build up phase to allow a player to prepare for threats. Especially because a player is unable to directly send the heroes to address threats at a moments notice. Using the flags and bounty system to incentivize your heroes takes money from your coffers and only works if you make the bounty large enough to grab their attention. Setting bounties, of course, hinders your ability to build essential infrastructure. The issues that this game has is not a matter of lack of player skill. There is very poor balancing in the game's economy and combat systems. There are some well concieved scenarios in the first third of the game where you are under constant pressure and the challenge is intense and enjoyable. However, in other scenarios where the waves of enemies constantly intensify, your base's capabilities will palteau and eventually crumble, but the enemy will not plateau. When this is combined with a scenario that causes you to constantly struggle to build and keep two or three buildings standing, you end up with a frustrating and disappointing experience.Unfortunately, it takes more than two hours to find this out, so a refund is off the table. My time with Magesty 2 makes me wonder if the devs actually had the game playtested it to understand exactly what kind of play experience they were actually creating. The genere is one of my favorites, the gameplay can be at times enjoyable, but there is too much in this game that is not enjoyable. I recommend not buying this one.			",163,25,0,23,20,1,41

												I enjoyed the first Majesty but this is an absolute waste of time. The developers just took the same sand box over and over. The only real difference is that this time there is no real progression or timeline.  Just about every level is a series of really borning yet stupidly difficult zerg rushes. If you happen to survive past a certain point it is a cake walk. If you try to move time ahead the characters start dying like they wouldn't on slower speeds. I hope the developers are working a fast food counter somewhere suffering with the idea of how they've wasted their potential.			",31,3,0,14,10,0,21

												Majesty 2  takes a spin on the city building RTS genre, Where you will be tasked to build your town and aiding heroes by providing them weapons/armor/potions and whatever else heroes need. In majesty 2 you'll have no direct control over the heroes instead rely on placing bounties and rewards on tasks in order to entice heroes to do your bidding; And like the first installment, majesty 2 is a very hard game.PROS-Very stylistic art style.-Fun sense of humor.CONS-very hard game prepare to lose a lot.-Can be very repetitve.Rating: 7.6/10			",67,14,0,17,10,0,26

												This is an underappreciated series. It's a RTS - sort of - where you only control building construction and a ""reward system"". Through constructing buildings in your fantasy city, you attract adventurers. Warriors, rogues, clerics, mages, etc. They earn gold by completing quests you give them, like attacking monsters and clearing lairs. In turn they spend that gold in your buildings, buying items such as healing potions and weapon/armour upgrades, which in turn gives you gold to buy or upgrade new buildings. It's a unique concept for an RTS. The game is a little dated now and it doesn't quite realize it's full potential, which is a shame. I'd love to see Blizzard make a version of Majesty.

Posted: November 17, 2016
												Let me start by saying I own the original majesty and expansion on disk and have played it for years.  So I will be comparing it  to M 1.The two games are very similar.  Almost identical on the surface.   However, M1 is very hard to play on modern machines.1. The early game is a bit of a struggle financially as your income is severly limited until you are able to get trading posts up and running without losing them.  In M1 you could place a trading post anywhere on the map outside a limited radius from your marketplace.  In M2 you are restricted to only a few preset locations for trading posts, but the upgrade for them is a weak turret able to defend from weaker foes.  Your progress in the game is entirely limited and artificially paced by your gold income, so it can be a little frustrating in the early game.2. Guilds are limited now to 3 heroes while in M1 you had up to 4. The way M2 is set up, the number of heroes you have doesnt have much impact on your income like it did in M1.3. Your marketplace has a set income per level and you can only have 1 marketplace, period. M1 allowed you to build many marketplaces and use the marketday feature to get more money to help you in the early game.  M2 controls the pace of your economic development rather harshly IMO.  It makes one of the campaign scenarios almost impossible that depends entirely on saving up a set amount of gold in a rather short time.  Gold that you need to defend your settlement from the constant onslaught of dragons and elementals from day one.  I tried that scenario a number of times now and still havent managed to save up the required gold(35,000) in the time limit. Im constantly having to hire or ressurect new heroes and upgrading everything so they can survive against dragons and elementals.  I think its possible to win, but I havent done so yet.  So anyway... the economy design in M2 is rather weak IMO.4. They have combined the graveyard with the mausoleum from M1.  Making a graveyard that now produces enemy skeletons on your settlement and you can also pay to resurrect your heros from it.  You do not have to buy a graveyard, it just appears at a random location by your settlement once you have had a hero die.  It takes up alot more space than the M1 graveyard though and that can cause problems when trying to organize your settlement.5. Guard towers are nearly invincible in M2 compared to M1.  However, when you upgrade your tower, your tower guard doesnt get stronger, which was a little disappointing to me.  A tower is cheap and can handle all but the strongest creatures, but also a large number of medium sized creatures can overwhelm a tower without hero help.  The point is, they are strong and I surround my castle with them right away at the start of a game.  I think they are a little too strong, and the guards a little too weak.6. The Inn.  M1 inn were a good source of steady income.  They produced gold regularly just like the peasant huts but a little more and heroes loved to hang out at the inns which also generated more gold when they did.  The Inn in M2 are pretty useless.  They dont generate gold and you can use them to create hero parties up to 4 members after upgrading it.  I think they do get some gold from heroes that visit the inn, but it seems that heroes prefer to run home instead of to the closest Inn.  To me the hero groups seem rather pointless, plus it costs you 500 gold just to form the group.  Overall the Inn isnt worth the investment.7. Temples.  Temples have almost become a moot point in M2.  You cant build one until you have upgraded lvl 3 castle and guilds, AND they cost a fortune to build, AND you can only build them on preset spots on the map whihc often are far from your settlement, AND you cna only hire 2 temple heroes or for an exorbant price you can convert an existing hero to a temple hero.  By the time you are able to get a temple, your heroes are already powerful, have everything, and most of the map will be cleared out.  There literally no reason to get a temple except that its something to spend your late game gold on.  In M1 you only needed a lvl 2 castle to build most temples and then you could hire all the cool temple heroes and get the spells relatively early in the game and enjoy them.  M2 has botched up temples IMO.8. Heroes Inventory space.  Too small.  They get 2 slots for a weapon and armor, and 4 slots for everything else.  Well guess what....   **** the magic bazaar and the 7 different potions available. Maybe its more than 7.  Im not sure since I havent finished the campaign and there are blank slots in the stores.  I will build a magic bazaar because it generates automatic income, but I do not research any potions.  Your heroes have limited inventory space and they need that space for the 2 magical protections at the market, a weapon and armor, healing and mana potions.  There is no room for anything from the magic bazaar.  They ****** up with that.  I dont recall how much inv space heroes had in M1, but I dont recall there being any issue.9. The Hall of Heroes.  Its a nice touch for the campaign, to be able to select a hero that you can hire again in the next scenario.  However...  by the time you can afford to build it and hire those old heroes, your new heroes will have caught up to them in levels and power so its rather pointless.  Better to just build another guild. Plus, what use is it in a multiplayer game?  Or even a custom game(if there is custom games... I havent checked)As far as I can tell... none.10. Scouting missions.  I dont recall from M1, but in M2 it seems only a ranger or elf.. and maybe a rogue will take an exploration mission.  I played one scenario and didnt have any of those 3 guilds and I would place exploration flags out, and not a single hero would do them, no matter how much money I put on them.  That annoyed me.11. The heroes are generally strong at low lvls compared to M1.  In M1 you would have heroes dying all the time at low levels with no equipment.  It made sense.  But was easy enough to just hire a replacement.  In M2 the heroes at low lvl are pretty strong.  Unless of course the incoming foes were high lvl.  They just run away.  Depending on the difficulty, they almost never die.  Warriors get tons of health, and clerics heal themselves... alot.  Plus, each guild can research special attacks, so not only are they tougher, but they hit really hard late game, even without upgraded weapons and armor.  Wait til you hire dwarves.  They are REALLY powerful. A lvl 1 dwarf is the equal of a lvl 10 warrior, at least.12. Something else about the dwarves.  They use hammers.  Or battleaxes.  I cant tell.  But there are no axes or hammers for sale in the blacksmith.  Only blades.  The dwarf can buy the blades and it counts as an upgrade for their hammers, or whatever.  A design flaw?  A cut corner?  Whatever it is, its sloppy and it breaks the immersion factor.13. The game runs really well, even on high settings with all the bells and whistles.  But, its still just as cartoony as M1.Summary.  It seems they tried to cut a few corners here and there, maybe even tried to innovate a little bit from M1, but overall I think they screwed up what they tried to change from M1.  From the restricted economy, which is no fun, to the limited hero inventory and the preset building locations which limits the building freedom you had with M1, and the pointless endgame buildings.There are no custom games in this.  M1 had complete customization, this does not.  Overall its not a terrible game, but it has more than enough shortcomings that I cannot recommend it.			",12,7,0,15,7,0,9

												I fully enjoy the game, and have spent many hours playing it. The difficulty is sometimes a pain but I have had fun trying different methods. I'm not aware of what exactly the dlc issues are, but the reason I do not rec the game is due to it randomly crashing. I'm not great at saving, so going a few hours in and having a successful run end due to a crash is frustrating. Remembering to save and have it crash 50% of the time anyways during a save is infuriating. Buy it on sale and if you have the patience to put up with random crashes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Majesty is one of the best City Sim games I've ever played. It's very different to most. It's kind of a hybrid RTS/City Sim. You don't control your units, you build your builds and use your money as an incentive for your troops to do specific tasks, either defending or attacking. Games can get quite hard and intense.Pros: Very intense, holds your attention for a while.Even though it's old it still holds up against games released now-a-days. Interesting way to do a City Sim game. Easy to understand, but hard to master.Cons: No PvP battlesNo 'eternal battles', all missions will come to an end, you have an objective so it doesn't compare to  a proper City Sim game in this aspect.

												This gets too difficult very quickly and there is no way to lower the difficulty.The first few levels were fun.I am a casual gamer that do not want to spend hours doing the same mission over and over and over.I like the fact that you have to give your units incentives to get anything done. You can not command them directly. It is something different.There is a lot to like about the game, but the fact that you can not lower the difficulty level is a show stopper for me.To quote the elves when they get killed in the game: ""This is no fun - at all""Edit 2015-06-01I got the following advice from a user called ""Patient Zero"" and it made the game a bit more playable (I could get past the ""King Rat"" mission. It was still difficult, but at least it was doable):Try thishttps://esatire.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/majesty-2-is-actually-fun-now-thanks-to-modding/I still do not recommend it without the mod.

												I played the first Majesty game and I remember finishing and enjoying it. I expected the same or better with this second iteration. Sadly, it failed to deliver because of the difficulty for some missions were set to impossible. I got stuck in the ""Mortal Foibles of Kings"" and cannot go much further.  My initial impression felt like the developers did not do a play test.I, for one, truly hate those rogue/rogue-like games that has no option to set the level of difficulty because I feel the developers of those type of games are just plain lazy. They do not care for the rest of the gamers who don't enjoy difficult & stressful game play. I believe good games should have difficulty settings and can be tweaked by gamers to suit their play style.  Majesty 2 is not a rogue-like game but it feels much worse. It is an old school RTS that is impossible to finish due to overwhelming obstacles rendering it unnervingly unbalanced in favor of the game. Rather than presenting an enjoyable experience for their paying customers, the developers chose to punish us. I hope they will release a patch that will enable the players to somewhat configure the level of difficulty... or if they don't have enough resources left to allocate for that, just provide an easy way to enter cheat codes. C'mon! :-P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a placeholder downvote for this game as there is currently NO MULTIPLAYER that I am aware of with this version since Gamespy is now defunct.This will remain until/unless either something like gameranger supports this version of the game or Steam removes the ""multiplayer"" designation from this store page.NOTE: Gameranger says it supports Majesty 2, but was unable to add this version (at least for me).  http://www.gameranger.com/games/Also, if you REALLY care a lot about playing (and perhaps moreso if you have specific people you want to play with) hamachi may be an option, but I'm not about to set up a VPN and look for people to play this game with, for me it's just relegated to the single player list.

												Awesome game! This game is simply great...It's a mix with rts game and like mmo style (but not massive) with level progression, quests and so many others stuffs.The difference with other rts is that you don't interact directly on units. You simply put some quests here and there and make offers. Then your kingdom acts!This is strongly addicting! First time i played this game i stayed 11 hours non-stop without eating or something else! My hand was red because of hanging the mouse.Graphics are good, music are nice, animations are very cool.And the game is pretty hard in some skirmish missions (not campaign) but still not impossible.The only problem about this game is multiplayer that has closed because of gamespy.But there's still a lan mode, so I think you can still play it online with software like hamachi or maybe game ranger, i don't know...Just go into it!

												Great visuals.Love the lore of Ardania as carried on from the original Majesty.Poor design and balance.Campaign is linear - if you get stuck on a tough scenario, not more fun for you.No random maps, a preset number of independant maps exist, but they are still very challenging.If you played Starcraft 2 and like having to refine your build order to combat specific threats, youmight enjoy this.If you want a casual, fun, possibly quirky game and the image of Majesty 2 suggests, buy something else.Overall rating: 6/10			",20,26,0,26,5,0,14

												A game Series that was truely underated, the fantastic voice work and world is so engaging and dynamic. the lack of direct control over units creates a living enviroment for you to observe, you watch as a wizard and barbarian form a strong bond and slowely grow together.

												In Majesty 2 you are just that the king who hires the heros and gives all those annoying kill this explore that escort this quest you see in mmos and rpgs.While I disagree with the art style they went with making an already silly game more cartoonie and how they made temple recruited soliders gods and how u can now revive your heros straight from the graveyard making the game much easier imo I still love the game.

												It's Majesty, what's not to like about it? A little easier than the 1st one and the world looks like Sacred 2 which I happen to have enjoyed, so yes, I say you should get this game. Only bug I found so far was not being able to set an attack flag on the goal castle but I built warrior and ranger guilds next to it and got a hero to lev 20 spam healing him while it ""bugged"" out. Not really a whole lot out there for newer fantasy RTS so may as well play it in my humble opinion.EDITED - 1 thing tho missing is the ability to turn off the non stop Connery spam, it gets annoying after while. I'd much rather figure it out for myself than have the play interupted so much, or at least an option to turn it off.			",10,0,1,5,7,0,5

												It's not perfect, but it's damn fun.You rule a kingdom, you construct Guilds and watch your Heroes (Rogues, Mages, Warriors, Priests etc.)  run around and kill stuff and protect the cities you build. Caravans, marketplace, blacksmith and much more make up your cities. Earn gold and upgrade them for better gear and potions for your heroes. You can also research spells that cost gold to cast, but helps you manage your kingdom. That healingspell at  just the right time can make or break a fight.There's a lot of AI in the game that has to be fine-tuned to make it work. It's ok, but of course not perfect. I do hope for a M3 with even more of the same, just better!It's cheap, and well worth the cost vs. hours-of-fun ratio.			",752,262,30,159,98,4,190

												The mechanics for this RTS are unlike any other I've ever played, and the way it works is very intrigueing. Unfortunately, this game suffers from a sudden spike in difficulty too soon and that turned me off completely. Maybe in the future they will do a re-release with an easy mode or something along those lines.Not really much else to say, just heed my warning.

												Majesty 2 (and the expansion packs) build upon the experience of the first one, that is, a strategy game where you cannot control any of your units. Instead you supply them with potions, new weapons, enchantsments etc. In order for them to do your dirty jobs, you'll have to place bounty flags on targets (whether it's for killing or defending). Now, for the actual review; I found myself drawn into this game rather fast - I was a big sucker for the first one, and even though this one gave off a different 'vibe', I did end up falling in love. It wasn't this ""love-at-first-sight"" dealy like with Majesty 1, but rather a more of a rebound type of love. You know the feeling. She looks like your ex, she talks like your ex, even somewhat similar personalities -- but at the end of the day it's NOT your ex. For all intends and purposes this *is* Majesty - but without the British accent - without the extra edge and charm. The Campaign was interesting, and I'm fond of the fact that they mention the acheivements of the previous rulers (you). The Expansions were... Meh. I mean new missions - yay - doesn't help that they are rather bland. Don't even get me started on the Monsters-pack, so many spelling errors etc. What I'm trying to say is... Don't fool yourself into thinking this is Majesty. It isn't. It plays the same way, and it's great as a standalone title. Just don't be blinded by the title and the shiny ""2"" after it.For this kind of game it's quite nice. 7/10.			",17,0,0,2,7,0,8

												The game is not that hard. It is quite random, so you might have to restart some missions. But I've never died in 20 seconds or because the indestructible lairs like some people say in their comments. The rat king mission is also not that difficult (there are much more difficult ones), but yeah, you won't beat it the first try. The AI is seriously stupid, but I actually find that quite fitting with the comic setting of the game, I've had some laughs, specially with mages ""out for trouble"". My only real problem is, DLC is available exclusively online, and you cannot load a game you start online when offline. I'd recommend this game if you don't mind a challenge, but I cannot, because the DLC issue.			",143,37,6,31,15,1,33

												The game attempts to be like the game ""Dungeons"" except you are the king without an ingame pawn other than spawed subjects. The first few maps are kinda fun and the graphics are pretty good, but the game has no balance after several hours of game play. What I mean by this is you figure out what buildings to build first to survive each map. Then after you can survive without being steamed rolled by AI...but as the the difficulty advance later in game the AI pawns on your side becomes very tuff to bribe( you cant control them..only offer a gold reward on objects to get them to do what you want); and the opponent AI continues to send wave after wave of spawn opponents. Sometimes I wonder if these developers even play test there own game for balance...Well after several maps it becomes repetitive and fustratiing to enjoy...I really wanted to like this game but screenshots are better than the game play.... Many Youtube videos show the first few hours of game play and thats were most of the fun was before it became a choir...			",33,19,0,40,9,0,11

												This is a great game that takes a departure from stnadard RTS games in that you don't have direct control over your units. You start each level with a castle and you have to build various guilds and economic structures in order to grow your kingdom. You decide which buildings to build, which things to upgrade, and how many units to train. The only resource is money, and it is handled either throw your own economy of units buying things at the marketplace to improve their stats, or by building trading posts. Units will interact with buildings by buying better armor, potions, etc. and begin to level up as they face off against creatures that attack you kindgdom. You can manipulate your heroes by assigning reward flags to targets, setting explore flags, or setting defend flags. Each level is designed with a particular objective (kill a target, gather enough gold, defend for x number of days, etc)There is lots of unit variety, from rogues, to archers, mages, warriors, and then high level units which have powerful abilities later on in the game. There are also lots of things to upgrade, and many unit combination to explore once you can build inns and form parties. Leveling your units is also satisfying as they learn powerful skills and maul their enemies in the most impressive and satisfying ways. This game is incredibly addicting once you get the hang of it, and missions easily span hours at a time. Graphically the game holds up great and things animate and look reasonably well. There is some nice humour thrown in for good measure with your advisor having a rather amusing sean-connory-like voice. Also your units say random things as they go about their business in your kingdom, so this game has quite a bit of charm. However, I will say that there isn't much of a story, but the mission scenarios feel varied enough with you having to fight all sorts of mystical creatures in intereting ways.  As far as difficulty, about half way through the game it skyrockets. The premise of the game is to manage to build a starting kingdom with limited resources that can fend off attackers. Once you get comfortable and money starts rolling in you, you can amass a grand army and plow pretty much anything. The issue is that you have to become very clever with where you put guard towers, and were you position your marketplace/guilds. Especially in the later missions, older strategies won't work and you'll have to do a lot of trial and error to figure things out, ie. it almost becomes a puzzle game. This game is definitely not for the faint of heart and it gets really HARD. Reading guides online is sometimes the only way to progress (it's totally frustrating, but also totally worth it once you figure things out). In my case, I couldn't get passed only 2 missions, so I used a hack to get extra money at the start, which is another option to make certain missions more enjoyable. This collection comes with 4 games. The original majesty 2, 2 expansions which just add extra missions, and then the Monster Kingdom. The first 2 expansions ramp up the difficulty even more and I recommend staying away from them unless you really like this game. The last expansion swaps your human-like kingdom for a monster-kingom. The difficulty is much better balanced and makes for a better expeience. In sum, I have put in 25 hours over the course of 3 days into this game (it is hellishly addicting once you get going). In total there is probably 50+ hours packed into this package. I can heartily recommend giving this game a go, because it's an experience unlike any you've ever had. Just be prepared for the difficulty spike (so use those internets to your advantage).			",122,37,2,3,3,1,6

												Great game!Once you get use to how the game is played it is an awesome game! graphics are dated but the game play makes up for it and more, great expansions very hard at the point of fustrating at times, but once you beat a level it leaves you satisfied.The only negative's I have on the game is it is full of bugs, poor technical support. If you can some how manage to work around the major bug flaws you have yourself a great game.			",91,12,1,19,15,0,14

WARNING DO NOT BUY! WARNING DO NOT BUY! WARNING DO NOT BUY!________________________________________________Bought this game yesterday and as many many others I got the error of no internet connection when starting the game (also means no Singleplayer).There is a fishy fix suggested by a Dev where you should register at their forums and verify with your game key to see the details but it's not possible because the forum doesn't send you an email-confirmation link to activate your account. (See pinned discussion in steam forums.)That this game is still being sold is basically a scam and I already requested a refund!P.S.: As far as i have overlooked from crawling the forum threads the game doesn't work because it was made for GameSpy (which doesn't exist anymore) and Devs somehow weren't able to provide a fix through direct steam patching.There are no more paid Devs working on this and it seems like the fix was done by a dude on his last day of work while being drunk.No one cares any more and even people who first bought the game are now pirating because the cracked versions actually do work, lol.

												Coming from many, many, MANY hours spent playing the original Majesty, this game really feels like a letdown.  Where in the original the characters and buildings were unique and instantly recognizable, the opposite is true here.  At first glance, the guilds all look the same.  The same is true for the heroes.  They also seem to have reused much of the audio from the original, which is not a positive in my mind.  This isn't because the original was bad in that respect, but it looks really lazy on their part.  Maybe I'll come back and really put some time into this game at some point and find it has a lot to offer, but probably not before putting in another 100+ with the original (and to my mind, better) Majesty.

												Unique RTS game in that you don't directly control chracters. You do choose what buildings you want made, but after that, it's all about setting a gold reward in order to get your soldiers to explore, attack, or defend something.The game is known for being really difficult, and that's true. It can get frustrating because after the few beginner levels, you are basically under a constant state of attack and need to always be rebuilding. Also, you have to constantly monitor your soldier producing buildings so more soldiers can be made after old ones die, and that is unnecessarily cumbersome.I only played half the game(or less?) The first 1/2 was fun, but the second 1/2 got to difficult, and I had pretty much found out how to max out production on early levels so there was nothing new to do, but grind on. So I quit. Pretty graphics though.			",144,73,13,6,46,1,18

Posted: January 11, 2015
												Alright, here is my review after putting in half a day's worth of time in to this game. Oh, and before I go any further, no, I did not complete the campaign, I'll get to why in a moment. So, without further delay, here is my breakdown of this game.First of all, this game is for masochists, whether you got an unnoficial ""balancing mod"" or not. This is hands down the most frustrating misuse of a fantastic idea I've ever seen. The idea is pretty great, a fantasy sim city builder that tasks you with managing the kingdom by building and providing incentives for things to get done, all while your heroes do their ""best"" to rise in level and maybe usefullness. There's also some great voicing, at least on your side, and some pretty cool ideas that actually pan out (such as creating parties), but that's about it. Now, for the long list of absolutely terrible crap that will continue to make your gaming experience hell. To start with, difficulty, there isn't any way to control this as the game goes from novice to advanced after two missions (read easy to holy hell wtf happened to my town?!) A lot of your completed missions thereafter are based off of luck rather than skill due to enemy spawns and constant zerg-like-rushing. Oh, did I forget to mention that? Yeah, there is absolutely zero room whatsoever for flexible strategy. Thanks to that weird developer minset you'll find that some heroes are just plain worthless, causing you to only waste your gold on their buildings for upgrades. Oh, speaking of gold, enemies don't rely on any kind of resource for whatever unholy reason, and can continue to pump wave after wave at you until you take care of their spawns. This is usually only mildly irratible however, on some later missions, you'll find yourself constantly under pressure or on the brink of ruin merely two or so minutes into a level. So if you like rushing your missions by pumping out the right heroes from the get go without actually taking the time to enjoy the game (read play for more than five minutes per mission) then this is the game for you. If you like to take your time to actually enjoy your purchase, forget this game, seriously just forget it.So, if you've actually made it this far in my review and still wish to purchase this game AND don't consider yourself a masochist, I strongly recommend you dowload an unoffical balance mod. The one I used came from this site: ""https://esatire.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/majesty-2-is-actually-fun-now-thanks-to-modding/"" and it helped me somehow manage to enjoy myself up until a particularly frustrating mission called ""Royal Feat"". Honestly if game developers design it so that you have to play a fantasy/sim builder/RTS as a juiced up version of Starcraft from zerg-rush hell then they're doing something incredibly, moronically, wrong.I get way less stress playing the Ikko Ikki on Total War: Shogun 2. And it's far more enjoyable....			",79,7,0,39,9,0,19

												This is an RTS. Sorta... More realistic than what I would believe a game should be.Instead of the a-typical select units, tell units to go attack in a flank formation, command mid-battle to turn the tide, etc, etc- it's more of a system to entice your units into what you want them to do. You set a reward on a monster, and then put a bounty on it's head. That is an amazingly cool idea- but in practice it doesn't work out so well.I had set my flag, and set the bounty to 100. No one would go kill this monster... I set the bounty to 600, nothing. Finally around the 2000 (more than a 1/3 of all the money I had available) mark someone wanted to try it. They promptly died, so one more decided to try it. They died. There isn't really a symbolence of strategy here as I watched each unit die to just one, the very first at that, monster.At 4,000 I finally got more than one unit to go and they spent more time running away together than fighting. And for 2/3 of my kingdom- it was awful.			",220,22,5,32,15,1,23

												Quite repetitive.... or I didn't get the right grasp of it.Anyway, undestructible sewers and undead-spawning urban graveyards made the trick and eventually discouraged me from playing on.They spawn endlessly, you can't do a thing about them.No walls either... only towers...Such a unrealistic setting does not appeal to me.

												The game is not supported anymore. Without the internet services it's not worth picking up, even on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Compared to Majesty 1 not so innovative but still highly addictive game which offers hours of gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you played settlers and enjoyed it this is the same type of game but you have more hero features less management			",92,15,10,30,35,2,28

												DONT BUY IT.If you like getting beaten down by improperly scaled maps with the rush starting in the first 10 seconds of a map go for it.Once you figured the exact placement of buildings to start off a map, then, and only then, you can start playing. And once we have figured the puzzle (how to survive the first 10 minutes is the ONLY puzzle) then you♥♥♥♥♥♥everything on the map and you've won.Honestly, I tried, and tried, trying to find ANY interest at all. I give up.			",59,33,0,67,15,1,29

												This is of course a sequel to Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim, just a collection with all the DLC (think expansion packs, not just small additions though there are a few). I recommend picking the original up if you can handle dated graphics, the gold edition is available on Steam as well but that's not what this review is for.Like the original game you play as the King of Ardania, who with your trusty comedic aide/advisor you build a fairly simplistic kingdom of a market, blacksmith, guardhouses and various guilds to train Heroes. Heroes are the key to this game as they are the characters that will fight your battles and you have the most influence over. Influence is the best word because you cannot directly command them to do anything, just merely suggest they do some tasks by setting bounties (attack, explore, defend) as well as a fear flag which while it isn't a bountie in the true sense, they work on the same mechanics.The campaign chronicles the journey to become the undisputed King of Ardania, as time progressed from the first king (from the first game) each king has tried to secure their place in history with grander feats of bravery. Lets just say the last king didn't do so well and you should watch the opening cinematic to see the bravery your forebearers had. The campaign is missioned based and you generally need to complete each mission to progress to the next ones, they generally unlock one or two missions at the same time and for replay value the tutorial is completely optional. Be warned, it does start simple but you do get a large difficulty spike later.I recommend a Majesty game to anyone who is remotely interested in the premise of the game, this is a worthy sequel but the changes made sort of balance out the improvements made to make it equivalent to the original. The biggest difference from the original (for me) is most heroes will not respond to your bounties quickly unless you put some real money on them, not necessarily a bad thing because it does seem you get more gold income but it can be slightly annoying if you're used to the original. If you want this as an updated version of Majesty you won't be dissapointed, though you may find yourself wanting a bit more.			",151,38,3,22,24,3,42

												This game is much, but not a Kingdom Simulator. Thankfully, because that would have ruined the game. It is more of an overworld Dungeon Keeper where you build guilds in which you can recruit heroes and then they live there and walk through your town fighting and levelling up.The flag system is interesting, because most of your heroes will not be heroically without a paycheck.The only problem I have is that the difficulty sometimes is to hard and other times to easy.Do not expect to have direct control over things, because you are the king. Think of this game as more of a mastermind game, where you set the board and the figures play by themselves.If you are into that, buy it!If you are into direct control and hate infinite spawns that pump out enemies until you destroy the spawn, then stay away!
