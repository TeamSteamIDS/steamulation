												In short i spend 2600 hours in this game (2 years) and never regret buying and playing it -Awesome game, awesome campaign!! -Brings WH40K to life-Buy it if you love tactical RTS or just a WH40K fan...its totaly worth itThe Long Version~Welp been a fan of WH40k for awile now and still is. As you can see the 2600 hours that i played this was one of the longest games i played and if you like more tactical and up close RTS rather than mass production and watching everything explode, then this game is for you.In my opinion they also improved alot of the Warhammer 40K models/characters to look more badass, Space marines look more heavy/bulky and...well they just made every faction look more believable and cool looking compared to DOW1In terms of following lore they did try their best and improved alot compared to DOW1. but really how can you balance things in a legit game when 1 Marine has the potential to take out a small army in lore wiseIts a good game.

												Most people know what this game is about. The store page is pretty accurate in describing what it is.Is it good?Depends. Some people enjoy making a massive army and steam rolling the enemy. Others enjoy having a smaller amount of units and managing them using their unique abilities. If you fall into the second of these two, then give this game a go. If you prefer large armies, I'd say pass on this.The Warhammer 40k universe is incredibly well presented in this game. The gameplay is mostly focused on smaller squads and managing their abilities. The combat is great with it's array of animations (which you can catch repeating a little too often sometimes) and solid sounds to back it up.The single player campaign is good, although I think most people will be attracted to the multiplayer more than the campaign.What I would add to this game if I could would be to add more races (I miss Tau and Necrons) and have more maps to play on.A solid buy if you enjoyed previous DoW games. Just be aware it does differ from the first and although the addition of Tyranids is awesome, they've left out other races.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When Dawn of War II came out, it was an absolutely groundbreaking title. It offered some of the most competitive multiplayer at the time, and the later addition of The Last Stand mode offered hours of entertainment to both casual gamers and pro-players alike.Now, if in 2015 the size of the multiplayer community has dwindled only to a fraction of what it was, you can still find other players out there (steam forums help in this regard) and enjoy some good games, or just plunge straight through the campaign.Dawn of War II was worth every cent at the time it was released. As part of a Steam Sale, however, there's no reason for you not to pick this up and give it a go. Especially if you're already  fan of the first Dawn of War, or just appreciate the universe of Warhammer 40,000 in general.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II is the next installment to the critically acclaimed Dawn of War franchise. It was developed by Relic Entertainment who has done a fine job handling the series with respect and care, and giving the Warhammer 40k universe justice.Dawn of War II is a Real Time Strategy game set ""in the grim darkness of the far future"" on Games Workshop's popular Warhammer 40k tabletop universe. The player will take on the role of a Blood Raven Force Commander who leads a small task force in a desperate attempt to save one of their last few remaining recruitment worlds from the destructive power of the Aliens who seeks to destroy it.

PROS:+ Good Visuals: -The game could have used better textures but it still looks nice as it is. Combat animation and movements are great which complements the very well done character and unit models. The game should be 5 years old by the time this review is made, but it has that kind of visuals that ages very well.+ RPG Type Campaign: -Also a CON (see below). Although the Dawn of War games are known to be a Real Time Strategy Game, this Dawn of War II's Single Player Campaign mixes an RPG element into it (character progression and wargear customization). The original RTS formula is not lost however, because the Multiplayer experience, whether against players or the AI, is still a traditional RTS experience.+ Wargear and Character Progression (Level Up): -There is an healthy amount of drops and loots in this game which works well on different combinations and situations. This vastly increases the re-playability of the game since the player may experiment with different character builds with different items to attain different results in their missions. This is specially true on the harder difficulties.+ Variety in Difficulty: -Single player offers a good choice on difficulty by having a fun and satisfying normal mode, and a very brutal higher tier difficulties for players who like to challenge themselves in fighting notoriously hard game modes.CONS:- Path-finding Problems: -I noticed that some of the unit's individual AI have a hard time grasping orders. They sometimes run out of cover, charge the enemy even though they are given specific orders for range combat, and even sometimes get delayed response to orders like throw grenades or bombs despite being in range.- RPG Type Campaign: -Some fans of the old games might not appreciate the RPG element since what really made the original Dawn of War games fun for them would be the base building, management and troop training rather than squad based tactical combat.- Recycled Maps: -Map variation in both Multiplayer and specially Single Player is woefully lacking with a majority of maps repeating on missions. Company of Heroes, a game developed by the same studio and using the same RTS principles, had more map variety and originality and it was released 3 years BEFORE Dawn of War II.CONCLUSION:With its flaws its still a good addition to the Dawn of War franchise. Although it has deviated from its original formula of a traditional RTS in favor of a more RPG-esque single-player experience, I can still say that I found it fun.

												3 Awesome and largley different game modesCampaign > control 4 squads, level up, find better Loot. You arent stuck with the same 4 squads either as they can be swapped for others ( dont like Scout marines, no problem, Dreadnaught?), some interesting boss battles aswell. Last Stand > 3 player controlled heros must survive against hordes of enemies, 20 waves with special boss waves, fight the Eldar , Space Marines, Imperials, Tyranids , Orks and Chaos. Level each Hero to 20, unlocking more gear as you level, Play as An ork Mek Boy, Space Marine, or Eldar Farseer. Multiplayer PVP or Ai > Small scale warfare heavily focused on tactics and stratergy, an example of what it can be like is 'Avatar of Khaine is very strong but a good opponent could kill him with a handful of troops if he isnt supported', each race can choose between 3 commanders, eldar for example can have a Seer Council Warlock, Farseer or Warp spider commander, Each commander has its own wargear to purchase in game. All modes are enjoyable, and the game is very well made with a great ammount of detail for an RTS, that being said , last stand and campaign double up as RPG games, I often feel like playing them if I want a change from Torchlight 2 or something similar.  9/10 would highly recommend. - Con - more could have been done for people who play the game offline, a lot of newer games seem to be very restricting to people who don't want to be online, this is no exception, although The campaign and PvsAI alone is solid enough to merit its very reasonable price tag.

												Dawn of War II is a science-fiction real time strategy game based in the Warhammer 40k universe.    When most people think of RTS games, games such as Starcraft and Warcraft typically come to mind. You have workers to build up your base so that you can train more powerful soldiers. Resources must be harvested, but there is a finite amount of them. Indeed, this is how the first Dawn of War functioned.  However, the sequel takes a much different approach.     In the single player campaign, you are given 6 unique squads, and 6 only, to take on missions. No base building whatsoever. These squads can be upgraded with weapons and armour, and can level up to gain bonus abilities. It is a extremely well-executed combination of an rpg and a rts. The story is fairly linear, but you are free to explore the planets and do side missions at your realative leisure (that is, until the space bugs show up. Then you need to be quick or else the bugs will eat the planet).     The multiplayer is also a genre-masher. Each race has three different ""heroes"" which act similarily to champions in DotA or LoL. They level up, can be upgraded, and can oftentimes turn the tide of a battle. All of your other units are spawned from you one and only building, so if it dies you're out of luck. There aren't any workers, and you must collect resources by capping points. A capped point will grant you the resource constantly. The more points you have, the more resources you'll consistently obtain.    The other huge change in DoW II is the ""Last Stand"" game mode. Three players, each controlling one of the heroes, must survive wave after wave of enemies (top-down horde mode pretty much). You're heroes level up, get more powerful, and eventually die because Last Stand is hard.If you enjoy RTS games, but are tired of the same-old same-old style that most RTS's follow, then I would recommend this game (or DoW II: Retribution the stand-alone sequel).

												This is one of my favorite games I highly recommend it! The campaign is very good and engaging, you can also do coop campaign with a buddy, 2 squads per person! The visuals are very good and so is the sound quality, if you have a good sound system or high quality headphones it really stands out! With the removal of horrid GFWL and achievement integration to steamworks new life has been brought to the game! Theres also Multiplayer and Last Stand! Both highly recommended after a run through the main campaign. If you like Company of Heroes type RTS games and/or are a fan of Warhammer Universe I highly recommend this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're new to the DoW fanchise you might like it, but if you're a returning player ehhh...The game is in no way bad, but if you've played the previous DoW games(Dawn of War, Winter Assault, Dark Crusade and Soulstorm) you most likely won't want to waste your money. I've been playing DoW since 2005 so I've grown very fond of the franchise, but this game and all of the titles after it have killed the series for me. They have gotten rid of the base-building mechanics completely; something that I thought defined the DoW franchise. It feels too empty for me to play anymore, maybe one day they'll bring back base-building...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a big fan of Warhammer 40k and strategy games so I couldn't miss this one. Story isn't much entertaining in this Dawn of war II series, but the gameplay where you lead 4 units and use tactics in order to defeat your foes (orcs, eldars, chaos, tiranids) who highly outnumber your forces is much more challenging and enjoyable. Game offers you coop option in campaign, where each of you controls two units, this is huge plus for DoW II, makes it even better and also playable on master difficulty.Game has few multiplayer mods, but with only a few players playing this game, its almost impossible to start MP match. At least some people still play The Last Stand mode, which is for me the best part of this game, 3 players in the arena fighting against enemies wave by wave. i think this game was meant to be played mainly in multiplayer but it didn't work that way. I recommend this especially for its coop campaign, worth to give it a try. 7.5 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Dawn of War 2"" is a very good game, though not necessarily the flagship achievement of the RTS genre. Part of the real-time strategy fans who like expanding the base and microeconomic management will be disappointed almost complete elimination of these elements. In exchange for material management we get a game filled with action, centered on the optimal use of units and requiring deal of intellectual effort on a par with good reflexes and tactical complex management situation. Cons of game, repeatability campaign missions and a small number of maps, does not change the fact that is a very polished product worth recommending to every lover of RTS.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While fun this game doesn't manage to hold my interest like Dawn of War Dark Crusade or Soulstorm. I am also loathe to call it an RTS because it departs from all of the core bits of that game type. There is no base construction at all, or unit construction. What it DOES do well is act more like a real time adaptation of the tabletop game. You command 4 squads on a map to take on various objective. Which squads you take are up to you, within the ones the game makes available, and you can go after 1 optional objective per run. Missions are scored by how you do on several factors, the better you do overall the more XP your squads get. As you level up your squads you can customize their skills and gear. The story is fairly engaging and the voice acting doesn't suck, but also feels like they tried to appeal to a more generic audience than a hardcore Warhammer 40k fan. Really it feels more like strategy roleplaying game and less real time strategy.  3 out 5 stars imo. Definitely worth it on sale.edit:and immediately after I post this the game decides it is going to refuse to launch for any reason, files verified as ok just stuck forever at 'preparing to launch' then it did even more weird things.

												In the grim dark future of the 41st millennium, my imaginary OCD compels me to begin every 40k review with ""In the grim dark future of the 41st millennium"".Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II is, as you may have guessed, a sequel to the popular Dawn of War games. However, it's very different. Basebuilding is nonexistent, you can only have around ten squads or vehicles, and the graphics look better. This is not to its detriment - the small scale of this RTS makes it much more tactical. The Eldar are also far less overpowered, so this is a plus. You gain resources by capturing requisition points and power nodes on the map. The HQ can be upgraded to gain more powerful troops. Squads can only be reinforced when near the HQ. This game is, so I'm told, much closer to the original tabletop than the first Dawn of War.In the campaign, you have four squads of space marines each led by an important character who levels up, gets wargear, et cetera, which gives it an interesting RPG aspect. And yes, I said ""space marines"", because they're the only faction you get to play as in the campaign. Moving between planets does have a great loading screen, though - you see a fleet of Imperium ships shoot off into the Warp.Another feature, although this is common to all Dawn of War games, is the army painter - for the fashion designer in you! It brings the whole ""custom army"" appeal of the tabletop to the PC, albeit in a much more limited form.There are only five factions in the game. Space Marines, Tyranids, Orks, Eldar, and if you get the expansion, Chaos. Space marines are generalists, Tyranids are basically Zerg (to be more accurate, Zerg are basically Tyranids - 40k came first), Orks have strategy that can be described with the word ""WAAAAAAGH!"", Eldar are the gorilla geurilla warfare guys, and I don't know what Chaos does. Dawn of War II's Chaos army seems to be somewhat Nurgle-focused, from what I've seen of other players.While some complain about how it's not enough like Dawn of War, it's still a great game in its own right. If you like 40k, I highly recommend this game, since it's great for short battles. The campaign does leave much to be desired for us non-Space Marine fans, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This the review of the righteous! Fear its divine power!If you're looking for incredibly zealous outcries to inspire your daily actions, then this is the game for you. Dawn of War II is the sequel to the original Dawn of War and all its expansions and it delivers in spades. For starters, this game is built on the rich lore and backstory of the Warhammer universe. After their disasterous defeat on Kaurava, the Blood Ravens are down to but a single star sytem from where to recruit their new members to fight in the Holy Emperor's name. One problem; the Tyrannids are coming and they have an appetite for planets and everything that lives on it. You control the Force Commander. A nameless, and voiceless avatar who leads a small taskforce from planet to planet to stop the Hive Fleet before it devours the precious planets of the aurelia system. Contrary to the original Dawn of War, this game is focussed on tactics rather than strategy and plays out on a much smaller scale. Instead of base building and massing armies you control up to four units, each with their own abilities and weapons. The game also introduces an RPG element that allows you to customise your squads with new armour, weapons and other items to smite the enemies of man. It is therefore such a shame that there is only one campaign to play. This game offers four different races to play as, but does not allow you to play them in the same narrative context as the space marines. That said, this game's campaign is no slouch. It is a fully realised story with stellar voice acting accross the board. If brawny men with zealous convictions are not your thing, then you better pass on this pack of awesomeness. Unfortunately for you, there are no other reasons to not get it, so what are you waiting for?			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												To this date, one of my favorite games of all time, made at the pinnacle of an era now past when companies released complete products to loyal gamers, and when ""DLC"" usually meant a comprehensive expansion pack with hours of additional content. The music, the animations, the graphics, the story, all, one after the other, on point. The mix of RPG-like elements with strategic RTS combat, on point. The limited base-building options forces you to be aggressive and punishes ""camping."" 10/10 with all expansions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to start out by thanking Sega (and Relic) for providing replacement keys for my entire Dawn of War series, years after I had purchased and subsequently lost access to the games. So big ""props"" to them about that!As I have mentioned before I am a big fan of the Dawn of War series, and I have played most of the games. Dawn of War 2 and Dawn of War: Dark Crusade are probably my favorites out of all of them ( I have not played Soul Storm, Retribution, or Chaos Rising).  I like the Direction Dawn of War 2 went with the single player Campaign, and have enjoyed it a good deal. I am also a fan of the multiplayer of course, but I have got to note I am really liking the Last Stand game mode alot!I am hoping Sega ( and Relic of course) sometime in the future further the franchise with another Dawn of War game. We Warhammer fans dont get enough ""good"" games. I have got to say if you are a fan of Warhammer, RTS games,   Sci-fi, or any genre in thereof it would be a shame if you did not look at the Dawn of War series. It may seems a little confusing at first with all of those stand alone expansions, but if you have read this far into my review, do it. Go look at them I am sure if, like I said above, you like any of those genres I mentioned there will be something in these games you will enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn of War 2 is a wonderful tactical strategy game.  Overall, the game is terrific with the only drawback being the miniscule size of armies you're allowed.  Compared to the first installment, it seems like a step back in most areas.  Campaigns are inventive and unique, making the single player just as enjoyable as the multiplayer.  The addition of the Last Stand with Retribution makes this an amazing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I thought it wouldn't be as good as the old one... it wasn't, it really really wasn't.I PERSONALLY found the story kinda of boring and the gameplay dull, the guns had no real impact and the repeditive nature of the maps for every missions was nearly the same, kill all the enemies then go after the boss and it took to long, Xcom knew how to do squad combat.It also pushes a story that is hard to care about, the same could be said about the characters that it tries so hard to push on you.It does have interesting defensive missions but that the only time where the game came to life for me. However, the resources you where defending where completely usuless to the actual gameplay, the arena was an interesting idea but I didn't care for it. I missed the base building where you could create an army where you could actually flank and use actual army tactics, yes the old one had its mistakes but it actually felt like you could build an amry and have massive, exciting battles. Even in the skirmish mode where you are meant to build armys it takes far to long and the battle generally goes back and forth and comes off as boring, with no obvious units that are clearly meant to be used agaist others and even the ones that are useless for the task they were intented for. The campaign in no way prepares you for skirmishers and multiplayer with completely different rules appling for the each type of game mode, I know there are meant to be differences but I feel that there is too big of a gap and so puts people off playing the other game modes. So yea over all point, this is not the amry building game that it claims to be, expect small squad combat that is slow and tedious where you mircomanage your squad. You can do better than this game, my advise play the older one, as I said before they have plenty of mistakes but are a hell of a lot more fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is only about Dawn of war 2 singleplayer campaign.Gameplay is very straightfoward and fast. There are wide variety of abilities and units you can select to slay your foes. Different enemies requires different tools of the trade. There are so many mixes you can combine with available items and abilities that game keeps interesting for a good time. Although 10 000 slayed orcs later you feel like you have seen it all. Boss fights are disapointing as every boss just takes 1 000 times more dmg than average unit and launches some special blast at a pre-marked zone. Bosses gets repetive really fast.Main plot and characters are well written and fits perfect to wh40k's rich lore.  I like the idea that you simple don't have time to do every mission there are available. You have to excecute missions that suits your overall situation best. Also there are usually 2 strategic assets on the map and you can only conquer one of them. There are 3 kind of strategic assets in the game each benefit different kind of boost to you. Choose the ones suits you game style best.It would have been much better if you could just upgrade your weapons with points that you get by completing missions. Now you have to constantly check dmg/stats about weapons that drops during missions and you get like 10 new weapons in every mission. Useless weapons (about 90% of all drops) you just destroy to get small amount of experience points. All this dazzling doesn't bring anything good to the game and this mechanic should have been simplyfied. CGI cutscenes looks outdated and they should have done them with live action like in wh40k: Final liberation (1997). World of warhammer 40k is still well represented in cutscenes and especially in the opening cinematic.Endless slaughter what this game offers goes really repetitive after you have seen all the type of enemies and weapons there is to see. This game is without a doubt recomended if you are a warhammer fan, as you get so much more out of this game if you know the basic settings in warhammer 40k universe. The game kind of assume you are familiar with the lore and goes straight to the ""Bom bom bom"" -part.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lot of things have improved from the original Dawn of War. Now the UI is cleaner. You can easily navigate around during the heat of the missions.The only minor grip is that you can't really hear the voice acting too well during the mist of a heavy firefight. What's funny is that once the battle is over with it goes from low sound to high sound in an almost instant. There is also the issue of lack of saves unlike the original one. This game offers online co-op which is cool. The details are much more improved since the last game. Although, some of the last game's mechanics seem to be more ""needed"" here rather than just the one game.All in all it's a good Warhammer game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bottom line is this shouldnt have been called DOW 2, its too different its more like some RPG/RTS Hybrid similar to the old Spellforce series. Base building is removed, micro is king and there are no longer armies vs armies. it has a lot of good points but fans of DOW 1 will be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn Of War II is easily one of the best real time strategy games out there. For me personally, it easily beats Starcraft 2, as far as the singleplayer mode is concerned, though. It has a brilliant mix of strategy and light RPG elements that all work together quite nicely. Find some random loot, give it to one of your units and you're all set to kill those damn orcs. It adds a certain layer of personalization. Plus, there's quite some loot to be found so there's always an incentive to explore the levels.The levels are set up with a cover system. Green means you get the best cover for your squad and yellow is 50/50. You actually have to set up your units carefully and not rush them towards the objectives. They'll only get killed. You *have* to use the cover properly in order to survive some of the tougher levels. Some of these levels even end with a bossfight, which are epic and awesome, even if they're not all that focused on strategy, but more on action.The graphics are, even to this day, beautiful and colorful. Just don't zoom in too much. The voice acting is also still solid.Now the story I can't remember so that hasn't made such an impression on me. But I admire this game for trying to bring new stuff to the strategy genre. It was really in need of some new and fresh ideas. Relic has done this beautifully.About the multiplayer; I must admit that I haven't really given that a shot, but the survival mode is addictive and hard. I've played that for hours and never once got bored. I don't think any other game before Dawn Of War II has ever introduced that, for the RTS genre that is.As of this day I'm still waiting for that Dawn Of War III announcement. Just don't make the same mistake as with Company Of Heroes 2, Relic. Make it refreshing and new once more, just like you did with this gem of a game.Highly recommended ![Rating: 92/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The old DoW was a basebuilding RTS game ala Starcraft, and it was FANTASTIC... this is NOT the same game, however, it is very in it's own right. Almost all the negative reviews are due to the fact that the core game mechanics have changed, and in my opinion, these negative reviews would likely not have even cropped up had the title of the game been something other than Dawn of War. Being a sequal, people expected more of the same with a few enhancements, instead they got something totally different. Pros:- Decent Graphics for a RTS even today... the animations are a lot of fun.- Great Micro gaming! If you are into Microing your units in RTS games, that is what the focus of this game is. You can pull off some really cool combos and tactics in this game, especially given all the different types of gear you can combine with various skills.- The game is fast paced, bloody, and ultra-violent. It IS true to the name WARHAMMER. - There RPG aspect of the game is pulled off very well, swapping up your team with various skills and loadouts really changes the gameplay. It's very fun to try new tactics and ideas.- The star map and mission selection is cool. Sometimes you will have to pass up on a mission to persue a different one and there are reprecussions for your actions. Let a territory fall and you may lose some of your orbital support in the sector, but maybe it was worth it to get that blue legendary reward from the other mission. You can always comeback and reclaim the territory later with bigger better gear. - The balancing seems pretty great. For every unit there is a counter, this includes bosses. Take heed to the tips before the missions as they will potentially let you know an enemy's weakness, or give you reports as to what the enemy is bringing to the fight so you can adjust your loadout appropriately. - You feel like you are getting stronger throughout the game, and some of the end-game weapons and skills are great!- Multiplayer is a lot of fun- reminds me of some of the greates Starcraft1 RPG mods.- A ton of content. I haven't even touched anything other than the base campaign, and then I get to play Chaos... after that if I'm still binging on the game Ill check out the DLC, but you get a LOT of content with just the base game. Cons- Towards the end of the campaign the game begins to get a bit repetitive. - Same maps are reused a bit too much. The maps are great, wish they had more.- Sometimes the pathfinding will drive you insane. Multiple times Ive lost a team because I told them to fall back, and they do so by charging straight into the enemy to go around the long way. Very irritating sometimes. - Level Cap at level 20 seems to come a bit soon... I want to keep progressing my heroes!- The inventory screen could use some filters. Things tend to get a bit muddled and cluttered as you collect more gear. Also, while the character screen shows base stats, it would be nice if it displayed other bonuses given by your equipment (resistances mainly... many different pieces of equipment will boost resistences, but you can only see this when you hover over the items).- Some of the bosses are kinda lame, while others are pretty awesome with their own unique tactics which can take you by surprise at first. - Multiplayer is dying out. hopefully there will be a greater player base with the announcement of DoWIIII think using the systems built here they have a great formula, and perhaps a different Warhammer franchise of games altogether. I'd love to see the same mechanics expanded upon in another game... BUUUT I also want to see another PROPER sequal to DoW. I enjoy both in their own ways. So, looking at the game in a different lens of NOT a base building RTS, but a tactical squad command game, I would highly recommend it 8/10. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beat single player campaign, have not touched multi-player.Absolutely LOVE this game.PositivesThe customization is great and allows for alternative play styles.The missions are engaging and require your attention, it's definitely action packed.You get rewarded for your different play styles and encouraged to try new things.The characters are likeable, and the story is great so far.You even get to learn history about the universe of 40k through the item lore, etc.BUY THIS GAME, and message me if you want to co-op.9 out of 10 stars. (only because I seldom rate 10/10.NegativesAchievements are tracked separately but for both games on the original and the expansion. Which means you need to get them twice, once in each game, which means you need to play original twice, and chaos rising twice.SO MANY HOURS...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My first steam game, yet still my favorite game. Dawn of War II is really different of Dawn of War I, as you don't have to build buildings anymore. Instead, you get to play with a few squads, which you can level and upgrade like heros, in the campaign. The skirmish is quite the same, except that you have to choose 1 hero, and you have only 1 building (the HQ, which can produce units). If it gets destroyed, you lost. And then you have The Last Stand, which is by far the best DOW II game mode. Pick a hero (Farseer, Mekboy, Space Marine Captain), join forces with 2 other players, and then survive through 20 waves of enemies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Didn't do it for me.  While I loved the first DoW, this one fell short.  Much more action/point-and-shoot than strategy of any kind.The missions felt quite repetitive, especially towards the end of the game.  I won the last few missions by just selecting all 4 squads and right clicking enemies.  (Also, on the last mission you end up being able to control all 6 of your squads but can only see life bars for the first four?  What gives?)There were SO many gear drops I felt like I spent more time sorting thru junk to find the best weapons and armor than I spent time in actual missions.  As other reviews mention, the plot/voice-acting is kinda 'meh'.  Some of the dialogue/arguing between your squad captains after the last few missions seems especially pointless.I can't comment on the multiplayer as I haven't tried it and likely won't.  I feel the first game just had a lot more strategy and was more of a challenge. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was my dad and I's first Warhammer game and we decided to Co-Op our way through it. It was fun and overall a good introduction to the Warhammer universe. We're both looking forward to Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III.Pros:- A lot of content for the price we paid. We picked it up on a steam sale at the time. However, the current asking price of $20 is still quite good in my opinion given how long it took us to play through it.- Gameplay is relatively easy to understand. The only problems we had usually resulted from my dad playing on a laptop. The controls for moving the camera around weren't very kind to him. (A disclaimer though is that it could have just as easily been user error potentially)Cons:- I can't particularly think of anything off the top of my head.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first Dawn of War was great but this is a completely different game and no where near as good as the first one...They've basically made the maps really small and cut out base building.If you were a fan of the first Dawn of War game don't buy this! It's tedious crap that revolves around which side can spam units the fastest. This is literally the Call of Duty of ""strategy"" games.This review will probably get a ton of down votes because the small fan base for this game worship it and attempt to silence anyone who gives it a negative review.

												I strongly recommend the single player campaigns for fans of small squad tactics.  I have loved this type of game since ""Hostile Waters"" and Ground Control"" but sadly  most modern RTS focus on base building and actions per minute rather than squad tactics. There is NO BASE BUILDING and NO UNIT BUILDING in DoW II hurray! You pick a squad of four space marines for each mission outfit them accordingly and then you go kill some bad guys. Combine this with a strong stoyrline,  fun and varied missions, a terrific Warhammer ambience and you have a winner in my opinion. Terrific.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review will be focusing more on the Campaign rather than the other features of the game.As a Warhammer 40k fanboy, I'm gonna write a passionate review about this game and share some of my experience, because honestly, this game deserves my everything.Ive played over hundreds and hundreds of video games, finished all of their singleplayer campaigns, but never has finishing a campaign felt so satisfying to me till now...The campaign of Dawn of War 2 is just incredible to me, I'll count the Pros and Cons to it.Pros:-Great character customization. You level up your squads with the XP they gain in the battles. It has a really good skill tree for your squads, and you have the choice to make a specific squad more damage wise or more support wise, (there is a skill branch for Health, Ranged Damage, Melee Damage and Energy).-Great story. Honestly, the story of the game surprised me, its incredible, you will actually care about the characters, and there are some moments in the game when you'll be like ''oh my...'' and I'm not even going to mention the last mission in the campaign, it litteraly made me SCREAM and gave me a ton of goosebumps from how exciting it was and how epic it was.-Pretty cool campaign concept, you will be able to travel beetwen 3 planets (Calderis, Typhon and Meridian) which all have diffrenent enviroments.-The Characters. Are. Just. BADASS. Seriously, the main characters are just awesome, they all have diffrenent personalities and just say some pretty awesome lines that will be stuck in your head for a while. The other characters such as the Orcs are just funny as hell, I dont think I mannaged to NOT laugh when I heard the Orcs speak, they just say the most hillarious lines ever... an example: ''ITZ DEM HUMMIES, FIGHT 'EM YA GIT''. -Freedom of play. The campaign has side missions in the campaign menu which you can go and do, most of them are missions such as defending a building, or killing some xeno commander. -Tyranid infestation. I think this is an interesting thing they added in the game. Tyranid infestation is a system, where the planets in the game, get infested by the xeno Tyranids. How much the planets get infected, depends on how you play the game. If the Tyranid infestation bar reaches to max on a specific planet, you'll be having a harder time dealing with them on that planet.-THE CAMPAIGN HAS A COOP MODE. Well thats all I'll say about the pros, believe me, there's a lot more things about it that makes it glorious, but the review will be too long. So here are some of the cons Cons:-It can get a bit repetitive during the end. I'll be honest, during the last moments of the campaign, you'll be doing 3 or 2 missions that are basically ''go and kill that Tyranid boss'', which can feel a bit repetitive in all honesty, but it isnt a big issue because thats a very small portion in the campaign and you'll forget about it once you reach the final mission.-Disconnects from the campaign. Well this happenend to me very rarely but I know people who dealt with the frustration of the random disconnects during battles. Dawn of War 2 is connected through its servers all the time, if they suddenly shut down or anything for a split second, youll get kicked out from the campaign to the main menu. (Luckly at most times, the game autosaves).Well thats the best I could, due to the steam limitation I cant write more. I definitely reccomend you buy it. Especially to the Warhammer 40k fans.

												Fans of the Warhammer universe rejoice! Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War II is the sequel to Dawn of War where the epic tale of the Blood Ravens continues.Control & Gameplay:Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War ll renews the Dawn of War genre by adding some new core elements. The well known base building and creation of armies have been replaced by tight squad control, where the micromanagement of these squads will lead to a successful mission. You control each squad's loadout, specialization, abilities and generally everything about them. You will also need to take heed of the terrain, where to take cover, where to move and so on. This might seem as a giant leap away from the first Dawn of War series, and it certainly is. It takes some time to become accustomed with the new game mechanics, but once you get settled, the game is quite enjoyable. In campaign mode, each mission will allow you to choose 4 specialized squads who gain XP and items by completing each mission. There is a fixed number of squads to choose from. In multiplayer, the goal is to capture points and hold them, while building additional squads to supplement your commander in battle. The only building available on the field of battle is the headquarters, from which you can spawn more troops. The controls are accurate and function without any trouble. In multiplayer, however, if a player is experiencing lag issues, it will affect the entire match, thus rendering control of your units more difficult or even impossible, if someone has a high latency. However, this issue is not prevalent, at least not from my experience. Fun Factor:Apart from the new style of gameplay, which can be a huge turn off for some players, Dawn of War ll is as original in its story as the previous games. The story remains rich and plays a significant part in the game, as you uncover dark secrets regarding the unknown past of the Blood Ravens. Currently, the game is being converted to Steamworks from Games for Windows Live. Therefore, if anyone chooses to buy the game now, beware that large segments of multiplayer is currently unavailable for use.Graphics & AudioThe visual aspect of the game is a continuation from the previous style: still dark and gritty, but with added details. The soundtrack is heavy and it enhances the coarse and gritty quality of the game. For the most part, it supplements the game subliminally. After a while, I did not even notice it due to the constant shooting and blowing up of mines, detonation charges and xeno matter flying around. Replayability:I have spent 100+ hours on this game already, so I would argue that the replayability is indeed high. Even more so with the two expansions: Chaos Rising and Retribution. In the original Dawn of War 2, there is a campaign and multiplayer mode. Additionally, the campaign can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer through COOP, which I would highly recommend. Furthermore, another mode was introduced, namely ""The Last Stand"". Here, a group of 3 commandos are pitted against 20 waves of unrelenting xenos. Definitely worth hours of fun and frustration. Conclusion:Despite the fact that Dawn of War ll has moved away from the original Dawn of War games in terms of mechanics, the game still offers exciting gameplay, a well-structed narrative and solid campaign. Where the older games focused on base building and overwhelming your opponent, the new games focus on managing a handful of specialist squads. Terrain, cover and movement patterns play a larger role in succeeding missions.The game does not run optimally online yet, as the whole net client is being transferred from Games for Windows Live to Steamworks. Therefore, this is the only huge minus about the game, for the time being. This will soon change, and therefore, my rating for this game is positive - 9/10.			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

												This game was fantastic. DoW 2 is a squad-based game that plays in real time. Imagine a real-time version of XCOM. With your squads you will defeat hordes of enemies and terrifying bosses. ""Purge the alien!"". You get to play with Space marines, scouts, force commaders, devastator marines, terminator squadrons, assault marines, and even a dreadnaught! ""I have come to destroy you.""+A very intersting non-linear storyline. A story you can get invested in, especially towards the ending. Many choices to be made in terms of ""Shall I defend this, or shall I let it fall and pursue a more-important objective?""+What I think are amazing graphics, a huge step up for DoW 2, pretty dang good for an RTS in 2009.+The sounds. The sounds of glorious battle. The sounds are great.+A huge variety of weapons and armor to equip you 6 squads with.+Each mission has a ""boss"" that challenges you once you fight through hordes of their minions, keeping things challenging. Unfortuntaely due to its age its multiplayer is nearly-dead, I could not find a match. Though I could find a match to the arena-based 3 player coop mode.That is fun but not many people are still playing that either. It plays just like the singleplayer game except you control one unit rather than a squad or several squads. Speaking of that, the singleplayer campaign allows for 2 player coop as well, I didn't have a friend to try it with though.I've got to give this game a 9/10, easy. This game trumps almost all others in its genre. It is not perfect, but it is a hell of a lot of fun. I definitely recommend anyone pick it up. $20 seems a bit steep since the multiplayer is dead but if you enjoy singleplayer and coop, maybe you have some friends that will play it with you? Definitely a must-play. ""FOR THE EMPEROR!!!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Look. Dawn Of War was an amazing game, and the three expansions only kept me playing it. To be quite honest I was also annoyed when I found out the base building is now no longer an aspect. That immediately switched all the original fans off to buy this game, I almost did too. BUT. The graphics are amazing! Usually I'm not one to play games as long as they have good graphics but DOW2 is a stunning game. There is also a loot system similar to Diablo which you can use to upgrade you heroes, yes heroes. We now have actual main characters with a story. You can upgrade all of them with difefrent weapons, amour and abilities. You also get ""skill points"" to selectively choose what you want your character to get better at. e.g There is a badass scout calledd Cyrus, you can upgrade his stealth to get better. But you can still choose to give points to other upgradesThe point is Dawn Of War may not be the game we have all been waiting for. it is sure is a damn good game TYRANIDS ARE FINALLY HERE! Yes finally Tyranids are in the game. and they are great.

												I've waited quite some time to play this game, first my older laptop couldnt run the game, then i bought my ps3 and ran out of money, finally steam had a great sale and i was able to fulfill my long waited dream. As huge fan of warhammer 40k, (since chaos gate, turn based game) and after playing dawn of war I and all the expansions DOW II met all my big expectations, the graphics are superb, the squad dynamics are awesome, and the pace is just right, the story is well written and has some interesting twists.I loved the rpg aspect of the game, improving the loadouts and pursuing additional missions to get better items, the perk system is balanced and suits for every gamer's style.On the negative end, sometimes during boss fights controlling all of your squads to avoid an aoe attack was quite impossible, the ai during formations was a little sloppy so if you moved all of your troops at once it looked like a circus rather than a marching army.Hope this was useful to anyone out there interested in this games.

												Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War II was pretty good. Unlike its predecessor, Dawn of War 1, the base building concept is thrown out the window with this one. Instead it's squad-based, like Company of Heroes for example, which happens to be a Relic game as well. It ends up playing more like an Action RPG really, with you using the specific skills of each of your unique squadmates, each with their own personality and class, collecting new armor, weapons, to change up your playstyle as needed, and last but not least, leveling up and boosting your characters. Hell, even the boss fights keep you on your toes, with their own abilities having you to keep moving around in order to take as little damage as possible. I enjoyed that, and I also enjoyed Relic's streamlined approach to ye olde RTS. And no, streamline does not an easier game make. It very much punished me for getting my priorities wrong when it came to focus fire on the wrong unit. Wasn't a complete cakewalk on Normal difficulty and I'm thankful for that. Though perhaps that could have been because I largely ignored the cover mechanic, which is strongly stressed in these games, yet seldomly did I feel the need to jump into cover.Now Relic knows how to make good RTSes. Not only that, they also know how to give the amazing Warhammer 40k universe the epicness it rightfully deserves. Now I'm not too familiar with the 40k lore at all, but this game got me curious to want to learn more about it, because it just reeks of awesome. The voice acting's awesome, the music fits right into the mood, and the ambience and atmosphere is spot on.The campaign mode isn't Starcraft 2's levels of inventiveness and non linearity, but it's not slouch either. You get all kinds of optional missions to do, special persistent buildings that you can capture that maintain passive bonuses for you throughout the game, that you have to keep defending every now and then against invaders. Though honestly, the missions do get a bit repetitive eventually, and by the end I just wanted to go to the ending and get it over with. Again, it's not because I found this a bad game, I liked it a lot, but I played the Campaign mode only, and RTS single player campaigns are hard to get right. While the old school RTSes didn't care at all about their level design, (build base, kill other guy's base, repeat) Dawn of War II at least gets points in effort for trying to mix it up.As for the story itself, it was admittedly clichéd but again, the epicness of the Warhammer 40k universe is so compelling by itself that I actually want to get Chaos Rising and Retribution eventually just to see how it all unfolds. Dawn of War II was a nice ride, but not one I'd keep coming back to for more over and over again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic campaign mode and story. Skirmish mode kind of sucks though in my opinion. Don't expect a base building rts like in Dawn of War 1, it's heavily focused on squad based real-time tactics. Chaos Rising is also a great extension to the story which I highly recommend along with this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first, I thought the sudden change in mechanics from Dawn of War I would steer me clear of this game, especially since the elements of base-building were removed, but after noticing that the Dawn of War II Complete Collection was on sale for a ludicrously low price, I just had to look into it.  While most of the mechanics in Dawn of War II are radically different from its predecessor, it stands on its own for a variety of reasons.  Improved graphics and better sound quality are always welcome, and while the strategic depth of maintaining an army and bases has been replaced with the complexities of managing squads with tactical planning, there are good things to be had from the latter mechanics as well.  The campaign actually gives names and small facets of personalities behind the characters the player uses that would otherwise simply be called ""Scout Marine"" or ""Terminator"", along with their own abilities and skill points to boot.  The player is able to determine the loadouts and equipment of their space marine squads, improve their combat prowess through experience, and ultimately understands what it means to be a battle brother.  It's worth noting that the player's actions can actually determine how well they complete the campaign with a score system that also gives the main character a badass title to boast.  The other factions have not been neglected either, the Eldar, Orks, (and in the Chaos Rising DLC The Chaos Marines) are all present with their own skills and strengths their squads provide to mix things up.  While I personally haven't bothered with the multiplayer, it's still fairly active, and speaking of multiplayer unlike Dawn of War I a second player can be invited to help out with one's campaign progress, adding new ways to reach, identify, and overcome different obstacles and objectives.  In Short:  While Dawn of War II may seem quite different from its predecessor, DOWII has its own merits worth noting.  If you prefer managing small numbered groups in a quality-vs-quantity sense and would rather focus on tactics than strategy, this game is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've beaten all 3 of the Dawn of War 2 games. They are some of the only RTS games I can enjoy, mostly due to the much lower number of units you are tasked to control. I can actually wrap my head around the tactics, whereas your StarCraft or any other just overwhelms me. The amazing graphics, audio, and dynamic combat with full destruction certainly help things.

												This game is fun if you are into MOBAs or ARPGs. But if you are looking for a good actuall RTS game or the succesor of the greatest game of all time, this is not one of those. The only positive thing I can say: good graphicsWhat I really really hate about the game:-retreat function-no way to stop the retreat halfway-no view range on strategic points and power noded-no ability to place listening posts on your strat points-victory controll point system-lack of bases-vanilla game was so poorly balanced you kinda had to play the elite mod, banshees could jump over nothing and would die long before they could melee any ranged unit in cover.-open maps (+ poor view range on strat points) allowed enemies always to sneak units behind the lines which would decap all your points before you can react.-original campaign was total boring with just 11 soldiers total instead of 100 soldierspoor pop cap + shared vehicle/infantry cap-can never controll areas because you never have enough units/turrets to cover every acces, and even if you could your army was spread tot thin-small squad sizes-game is more about microing special abilities than it is about troop composition and deploymenttypical game was over before anybody could afford a tier 3 unit.-useless minimap with oversized and ovelapping symbols, made it extremely hard to locate units when they were close to a strat point. The square structure symbol would overlap the power symbol when you build a power nod.summary of gameplay; there is no gameplay really... the only thing you do is micromanaging your squads to capture, decapture and recapture strat points, power nodes and victory points. Capture points faster than the enemy and you will win. From my experience I noticed that you quite litterly spend more time capturing stuff than to attend to actual combat. With so much micromanaging it was not even remotely entertaining to play vs an AI opponent as he would have a unit capping your points 24-7.My oppinion, this game is not even remotely an RTS game for it lacks the S part and as such it is an epic fail as a succesor to dow1. The gameplay is so horribly useless and because of the frustrating micromanaging I could not give 2 damns about the goodgraphics. If it was a standalone game I would give it 4.5/10 as DOW succesor 2.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												to be honest I'm a bit disapointed with this game though it was still fun to play I just felt that it just wasn't as good as the origanal in campain and multiplayer you just couldn't have a large amount of troops and tanks on the feild unless you play as orks or imperial gaurd (both in my opinion very weak) all this is, is a reskin with less units than before they removed 4 playable races which were from soulstorm in the first dawn of war (my persanal favriote being the Tau with their big♥♥♥♥♥lassers :P)Pros-good grahpics for game released in 2009-can be quite challenging for new players-they did add a new faction called the Tyranids-campain was interesting to play-has good stratery involved-has some really nice mapsCons-squad sizes are tiny-some units are O.P-could use more units from the previous series-you CAN'T EVEN MAKE A BASE you only GET BUILDING that makes ALL your troops! I mean c'mon the best part of the old one was making a big♥♥♥♥♥base and making a ford base to attack with.overall if you want a good game thats rts with HUGE armies just get the origanal it's much better and way more playable and don't forget WAY MORE FACTIONS!

												Heresy!What do you get when you take a different, albeit risky, spin on a popular franchise? You get Dawn of War II, a squad/tactics-based strategy game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe which is also the first proper sequel in the Dawn of War series.What is striking in Dawn of War II is how Relic decided to throw away all of the base-building and army management mechanics - staples of the strategy genre - and focus on squad/tactics-based mechanics instead where you can control of up to four (out of six) unique squads and capture points throughout various missions in the campaign. In other words, it is something like taking exclusive control of heroes in Warcraft 3. On top of that, light RPG mechanics were seamlessly implemented to give a bit more depth to the gameplay by allowing the player to level up their squads, assigning attribute points, unlocking new abilities, collecting dropped loot and customizing war-gears to their will; essentially a character progression system. These RPG mechanics, while basic, do provide some diversity in tactics when preparing for a mission. With no prior knowledge of Warhammer 40,000’s lore, aside from these Space Marines worshipping this Emperor of theirs and barbarically killing Tyranids (and other races), as if they are BJ Blazkowicz on steroids, Dawn of War II is actually capable of providing an interesting and somewhat immersive story, albeit nothing new to this genre though, with a fairly strong narrative even to someone who knows absolutely nothing about the Warhammer universe, like myself. About an hour or so in the campaign, you will quickly familiarise yourself with the lore in no time. However, this time around you are allowed to play whichever mission your heart desires in the campaign, with each pick having a certain consequence depending on its objectives. If you want to take a break from the main story-missions, distress calls act as secondary missions for you to complete within a limited time, despite most of them getting generic after a time. At least this creates a layer of non-linearity in the campaign, even if it is all just an illusion. And once again, unquestionable high production values all around coming from someone like Relic, especially in its visuals and voice acting. Where do they find these voice actors?Relic has been known for making good campaigns in their games, even memorable ones as seen in Company of Heroes, but ultimately everyone plays these games for the multiplayer. And there is no denying that Relic did well here too, again. With co-op added, it is possible to play the campaign with a friend and/or battle against each other in either the Victory Point Control or Annihilation modes. But the real meat of the multiplayer is in the Last Stand mode where you have to survive waves of AI controlled units. It is simply addicting and so much fun to play in this mode, especially with a group of friends. No wonder most current servers just run the Last Stand mode, because it is that popular.Sadly where Dawn of War II falls short is in its small and quite uninspiring map designs, repetitiveness in some of its mission objectives and levels, underwhelming boss-fights, squads’ poor path-finding and the lack of other playable races in the campaign (see the expansions packs); having different perspectives from different factions is always a bonus in a story. Also, once you clear out the campaign, there is little reason for coming back to it straightaway since the story, while pretty good, is not worth another playthrough for quite some time; unless you want to play on a higher difficulty, collect all of the achievements or maybe delve into co-op with a friend.And frankly, while the gameplay is probably not as deep (as you may wanted it to be), it can still deliver plenty of hours of fun regardless. Come to think of it, the reason why it is fun is because it is simplified, stripped down from its original roots. No more headaches from micromanaging all your troops across big maps. In actual fact, it is almost like playing a MOBA game, minus some aspects and without that overwhelming depth in gameplay. Moreover, due to the small size of most maps, a mission can take can up to around 15 minutes to complete, with multiplayer matches lasting potentially longer depending on skills. This eliminates the possibility of long-winded plays and getting tired by them, although this is fairly subjective.In conclusion, Dawn of War II is a good example where a developer took the risk to try something dynamically new on a popular and acclaimed franchise to at least satisfactory results. Whether this might have caused them to lose some hardcore fans whilst also gaining new ones, I personally do not care. It is a solid squad/tactics-based strategy game nonetheless, backed up by a story faithful to the Warhammer universe, a well-written narrative, high production values (as we are accustomed from Relic) and a strong multiplayer component thanks to its co-op and Last Stand mode, but definitely not without glaring flaws. Overall nothing mind-blowing, but it is tons of fun. If you are looking for a straightforward traditional RTS, either pick the original Dawn of War or try any other RTS out there instead, if you are desperately missing the good-old base-building and army management mechanics. Otherwise, this is a solid recommendation regardless if you know anything about Warhammer in general.And who needs to wear a helmet in combat when you have oversized body armours which weigh a tonne and have jump packs? Crazy, I know. And very impractical.			",457,209,7,77,41,6,76

												First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Warhammer and Warhammer 40k. I have played first Dawn of War when it was released + DLC Winter Assault and I really liked it a lot. Dawn of War II graphics is way better, gameplay has been changed but I enjoyed this one as well. Missions are now divided into 3 types - story missions, ""normal"" missions and defend missions. Story and normal missions are basically the same, story missions just drive the story forward. Anyway, it gets repetitive after some time, as its always the same during whole game - deployment of troops into sector, destroying the enemy, capture all strategic points on map and at the end kill some boss - stronger enemy unit. Together with limited number of maps it gets boring sometimes. At least devs included defend missions where cca 3-4 waves of enemies is trying to destroy your acquired strategic point and you need to defend 3 generators. The best way how to enjoy the game is keep some time between playing it or play something else until you have again need to play this. Why? Because its fun! Its fun to watch how your Space Marines troops are crushing your enemies, its fun to listen to their comments, its fun to improve their skills (yes, there are some RPG elements here), to equip them with better weapons/gears etc. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this game. My personal rating - 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Dawn of War 2 (and Chaos Rising as it is really an extension of Dow2) campaign is great fun to play through with a friend in co-op. The missions are challenging, the atmosphere is great and the cutscenes really add to the atmosphere (and I am not a fan of cutscenes). Highly recommended. Plus Relic are definitely good guys when it comes to long term support. Full marks to Relic for patching out the awful Games for Windows Live and replacing it with Steamworks. They did not have to, but chose to and for that I think they are very cool and it makes me far more likely to buy future games (Dawn of War 3 please!)Dawn of War 2 is a really great adaptation of the 40k universe - it strips out the base building of Dawn of War 1 and focusses on small units and heroes, which is much closer to the fiction and the miniatures game. Some people did not like that, but I definitely did. You control up to 4 squads (or 2 squads each if you are playing co-op) and fight a variety of foes each of which benefit from different strategies of attack. There is also a larger meta-game element of controlling various resource sites and that works pretty well too.All in all I highly rate Dawn of War 2 and Chaos Rising.			",429,147,9,73,45,2,104

												I've been playing the Warhammer 40k tabletop game since 2002 (originally with Space Wolves, now rolling with Word Bearers and Astra Militarum) and I loved the original Dawn of War. Dawn of War II has more in common with Relic's Company of Heroes series then it does the original Dawn of War, in single-player games anyways, as you are only in command of small groups of Space Marines. No massive armies of vehicles, fliers and Squiggoths in this one. Despite the reduced scale, Dawn of War II is still one of the best squad-based RTS games available. The graphics still look good, the music is the typical ""epic"" soundtrack and matches the grim dark setting. Control is perhaps the largest issue as it can be hard to get your squads to go into cover and it gets tough to pick out enemy characters.  Keyboard hotkeys help but it's still annoying. All told, for the price, Dawn of War II is a great pick up if you want a small scale RTS or just a decent game in the 40k Universe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Every mission is basically just land, kill some orcs, reactivate some things, go find a generic looking orc boss (with generic voice acting and generic video game boss type abilities) and kill him. I played 5 missions, but felt as if I had played only 1 mission because they were all the same. The missions are connected by what I would very hesitantly call a primitive ""storyline"". It basically consists of some voice-acted space marine saying some generic stuff like ""ok well there's this big ork guy and he's causing problems, go kill him"". Every mission briefing is pretty much exactly that phrase re-worded to give the illusion of unique missions. The mission content itself doesn't differ much either. Maybe instead of fighting shoota boys, you're fighting stromboys. Or instead of killing an orc warboss in a canyon, you're killing an orc warboss on a mountain top. Or instead of killing ork warboss A who did this one bad thing, you're killing ork warboss B who did another bad thing. See where I'm going with this? You would think that RTS games would have learned from the game design which Blizzard pioneered which included vibrant characters and storylines.The actual mechanics of the gameplay as lacking as well. One thing that makes squad combat games awesome as opposed to army combat/basebuilding games is that you can focus on more meaningful and deep strategic elements relating to the combat engagements themselves. Ostensibly, with less things to control, the micromanagement of what you do control can be more complex. Not so with this game. What you're able to do with a few squads is pretty much the same thing you do with mass engagements. You activate one or two powers or utlility items for max efficiency and that's pretty much it. In other words, all the boring stuff. It's clicky micromanagement and not STRATEGICAL micromanagement. Think the hero missions in starcraft and warcraft, only slowed down. Now true, you can take cover. However, most of the time it isn't necessary and doesn't exactly constitute high tactics. It just means that the game is clicky: click for cover, click to shoot, click to activate ability, click to pick up items, rinse and repeat. The only curve ball that forces you to adapt is when enemies throw grenades or a boss marks a circle of ground that he will soon jump on. But all you have to do is micro your squad away from it and move them back. Again, it's the tedious and boring kind of micro (and not that hard either), as opposed to the strategical kind of micro. This game doesn't encourage careful thinking, risk vs. reward, and lot of out-of-the-box thinking. Some tactics that I came up with were immediately shut down by the game. For example, you can't lure enemies into a killzone because they have a leash. Hit and run or guerilla type tactics don't work for the same reason. Scout units are largely worthless because you can see enemies farther away than they can see you. Basically, the player is forced to play the game one way. You don't even need to think about how best to use limited use items either because the game constantly re-supplies you.Moving on to the other areas. This game has a very rudimentary character progression system. You can assign some stat points. There are only 4 stats though, and they all progress in a linear fashion with little player input. To go along with this system is a gear collection system. It's very incremental and done with the classic white/green/blue scale. Some weapons and armors are objectively better than others, removing any sense of tactical considerations. The right way to do this would to have lots of gear, none of which is better or worse, but just has different tactical implications. Sadly, none of the gear changes the way you approach battles too much, opting to give you better armor or damage or health instead.      As far as production value, I would say the graphics are fine but the voice acting sucks. The layout of the hud and menus is rather poor as well. Overall this game is below average standards for RTS games. I bought it for 5 bucks on a sale and wish I could get my money back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing the Warhammer 40k tabletop game since 2002 (originally with Space Wolves, now rolling with Word Bearers and Astra Militarum) and I loved the original Dawn of War. Dawn of War II has more in common with Relic's Company of Heroes series then it does the original Dawn of War, in single-player games anyways, as you are only in command of small groups of Space Marines. No massive armies of vehicles, fliers and Squiggoths in this one. Despite the reduced scale, Dawn of War II is still one of the best squad-based RTS games available. The graphics still look good, the music is the typical ""epic"" soundtrack and matches the grim dark setting. Control is perhaps the largest issue as it can be hard to get your squads to go into cover and it gets tough to pick out enemy characters.  Keyboard hotkeys help but it's still annoying. All told, for the price, Dawn of War II is a great pick up if you want a small scale RTS or just a decent game in the 40k Universe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn of War II is a very divisive game, it's really nothing like its prequel.  Somewhere between the two games, Relic released another stellar RTS (Company of Heroes) that fundamentally changed the way RTS games play; it was a game less focused on base building and throwing huge armies at each other, but more focused on advancing technology and tactical engagements.  Dawn of War II takes over from there, and iterates the formula into the 40K setting.  Gone are the micromanaged bases and huge armies of Dawn of War fighting Epic-like battles.  You will lead smaller and fewer squads and named heroes, with ability progression and customizable wargear, choose your battles on a campaign map, receive rewards/loot, customize your hero and ultimately stick it to the filthy Xenos.  Don't jump in expecting Starcraft/C&C type of RTS gameplay, keep an open mind, and you will be rewarded with an incredibly rewarding campaign experience leading the Blood Ravens and their familiar heroes to victory and salvation.  Dawn of War II has graphics that still measure up to this day, and its requirements should be a piece of cake for any modern system.  Its campaign coop is incredibly fun, so I strongly suggest that you nag a friend into buying it with you.  Final caveat: Do not buy it for its multiplayer; for that, buy the standalone expansion Dawn of War II: Retribution.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DoW II is a huge departure from the original games, but not necessarily in a bad way. You most likely know that this game is a real time tactics game, rather than a real time strategy title. The difference being you control a few squads of Marines, with heavy amounts of micro needed to perform well. I generally hate that style of gameplay, but the plot and progression system are so engaging that it made up for that change in gameplay for me. Being able to outfit my men before each mission and decide their specializations was a blast, and really made me feel as if they were my troops. If you are a 40k fan you will undoubtedly enjoy this game because it is not only an objectively solid game, but it is 40k to the core. The grimdark aesthetics and brutality are still enjoyable to this day, and the satisfaction of slaughtering your enemies has not grown faint after all these years			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game genuinely surprised me. Great feel for the universe and tone, good variety of missions and the levelling/equipment system is easy to grasp but unexpectedly fun. Bonus points for the fact that your equipment and characters carry over to the expansion.Loses some marks (but not many) due to the amount of map re-use and the fact that tactics become a moot point once your equipment is good enough but still recommend it.

												This is a really fun game.  Looks to reinvent older ideas about strategy games.  Solid amount of expansions which add flavorful armies and unique game modes.  Graphics still hold up after all these years.What this game really has for it, though, is setting.  You don't need to know Warhammer 40k to enjoy the personality stuffed into each faction, and fans of the Wallet-Eater-Before-Steam-Existed franchise will enjoy references to the source material.And that voice acting, oh my.  Do yourself a favor and get this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II is a real-time strategy / tactical role-playing video game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ for Microsoft Windows based on the fictional Warhammer 40,000 universe. It is the sequel to the Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War video game series.  Dawn of War II features a non-linear interplanetary campaign, as the Space Marines. The campaign can be played either as single-player or cooperatively with another player through an online connection.The game's campaign departs from those of its predecessors in several key features. One of the most notable departures is that there are no base-building elements, unlike in previous Dawn of War titles. Instead, the player chooses the units to be used prior to beginning a mission, cannot build new units once the mission begins, and has only limited reinforcement options. Has several multiplayer modes of play.for more info:

												This is Dawn of War II, while I do recommend this game, bare in mind it is NOT like its predecessor, I would call Dawn of  War a classical RTS with a base-capture element, while this is more of a action-oriented tactical RPG with more units. The Campaign is the best mode in my opinion or the online area modes and you won't be constructing buildings at all, all you will do in the regular 1 vs 1 mode is producing units. Controlling units, bases and manage economy but there are no build orders you just upgrade your current base to build more units.A lot of people, myself included did not like this change. I am a big fan of 4X, strategy and RTS games, but this is more of a RPG, I would say the campaign itself is totally worth it if you buy it on a sale, then go ahead, and get ready to gear up your own space marine squad.And the customization in the campaign is awesome, you want to give Terminator Armour to Assault Marines? They pick up the Thunder Hammers, give it to your marines and they turn into regular old Terminators, want some extra range for your assault gun-carrying Termies? Then give 'em the good cyclone missle launcher and let loose havoc.The campaign really is the peak of this game and it lets you play from many different angles, but do keep in mind from an RTS point of view, Dawn of War I is the better multiplayer online game. But DoW also lets you play co-op in the campaign so if you just want to enjoy the Epic Space Marine bad assery with friends then totally pick this game up.			",264,50,7,57,30,1,47

												I could recommend this game for the singleplayer alone, I had so much fun commanding a team of Blood Ravens through a campaign where I felt invested and had to keep a strong will not to give in and fall to chaos in the really good expansion. The multiplayer is still quite good, although it has a few issues. I appreciate how they made it more like Company of Heroes instead of build massive army and steamroll. I didn't like the removal of base building elements however and the low population cap. Overall I highly recommend this game and it's expansions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn of War 2 forgoes its mix of micro and macro management gameplay from its previous series and focuses it all on small squad micro management. Here the player relies now more than ever on using terrain for squad, and structures as vantage points. This creates the pacing for multiplayer matches to become more about capture points rather than destruction of your enemy base. They have also removed creating tech tree structures, and streamlined the tech tree onto a single building.You still have your unit upgrades per squad, and your race specific Heroes. But the cost for upgrades have increased, thus putting more weight onto fewer decisions. Replenishing squad units aren’t on the fly anymore, healing is only available at base. And, since there’s no mention of constructing a new base, you have only one location to heal, your starting point.A match last about 30 minutes. However, the balancing feels a bit tilted. On a classic destruction game mode, if you control all the resources on the field within 10 minutes, you’ll find yourself spending the other 20 minutes trying to just break their base... unless if the AI happened to obtain unlimited resources, it appears they can heal almost indefinitely without any resource nodes. This is why they’ve probably added and defaulted the game mode to Capture Points, where you win by controlling the nodes.If you want to compare this to other game genres, this would be similar to playing a DoTA/MoBA but with a single player controlling all the units on the field. While enjoyable to play, Dawn of War 2 is not my cup of tea.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am just going to take a minute and write down a few thoughts I have had about this game as well as the additional games in this entire franchise. Because it is on a sale at this particular time I am jotting this down, I see from time to time a lot of people who wonder if they should get this game. The quick and easy answer is of course a most definite YES!, and I think for two very good reasons.I will go ahead and put as the #1 reason is that, given how long this game has been out, the developers Relic Entertainment is in my opinion one the best video game development studios to have ever come along. They have done such an incredible job with the way they made this game. Everything from the production values to the voice over acting is just a perfect example of putting big budget resources to good use. Another thing about this is, if you take a moment to look at the news and announcements pages for these games, Relic  is supporting this series and franchise to its fullest extent. There are lots of updates and general postings being made about these games on a constant basis to this day. Good communication with your player base goes a loooong way to helping people make good decisions about what games they should buy.The #2 reason I could recommend getting this series and games, is that the level of polish and overall feel of the games themselves is very top notch. These games run extremely well across a huge variety of PC configurations, low end systems to the very latest PC's. Along with this is that these games play very good without huge game-breaking bugs ruining your playing experience, seems like Relic did a great job with making sure as many bugs were taken care of before they released this series a long time ago, in general I found that all of Relic's older games including CoH, The Homeworld series, etc. were done very well.Some of the other things I enjoy about this series is that while I don't know a whole lot about the Warhammer Universe, I thought the story and characters are good enough to be interesting. Great campaign play, Good multiplayer action, and just altogether a solid, nicely done game series.And lastly, I should go ahead and mention specifically that the DoW II games are just slightly different from the original W40K DoW series. The original DoW series had a classic C&C base-building, resource gathering model while the DoW II series switches over and gets rid that in favor of a squad based, heroes model.Some people were surprised at the change, some liked it while others didn't, in my opinion it looked as if they wanted to go the other direction and that was fine. I would recommend in fact that anybody who wonders what the big difference is, is to maybe watch a youtube game review/let's play video that way you could see for yourself and decide that way because no one but you can decide if you would like that or not.

												Kinda fun but mostly frustrating gameplay that leaves you wishing GW would just make a full digital version of their tabletop wargame. Your squads take cover, fire, and have some special abilities that the enemy instinctually moves out of the way of (those eldar farseers have seen the future, they knew you would throw a grenade there). The battles can be fun but become monotonous after a mission or two. The boss fights are slug-fests against a massive hitpoint enemy that typically runs over or smashes your guys killing them instantly in one hit. The tactics to the boss fights center around you comically keeping one guy alive and trying to revive your men after they are one-shotted over and over. The game makes you wonder wtf is going on when your supposed elite super warrior melee badass captain is one shotted by what is considered a routine troop in the tabletop game. You will end up wishing the game was more dynamic and allowed you to format your attacks and strategies like an actual Adeptus Astartes commander, but honestly you just feel like an IG commander throwing mindless expendable guardsmen against the xeno tide.

												Dawn of War II is perhaps the best example of a sequel outside of StarCraft II in the RTS genre. While it tossed out Base Building for a more streamlined approach, it did so with flying colors combining Diablo style loot drops with an RPG leveling system and an extensive skill tree.Pros: +Decent story with likeable characters+Excellent loot, weapon, armor, and class variety+Great graphics and animations that still hold up to todays standards for RTS games, especially for 2009+TONS OF CONTENT! On top of a 20+ hour campaign that is highly replayable, you have Co-Op on top of that. (The online modes should be played exclusively on DoW II Retribution though as that has ALL the factions and the majority of the community.)+Fantastic combat with great enemy variety, boss battles, special enemy types, and lots of guns, powers, and toys to play around with+Huge open maps meant for exploration to find loot and other goodies as well as mop up any enemies to rack the experience points.+Decent mission variety with story missions being the most focused with optional Assassination and Defense missions to spice it up+The voice acting is SUPERB with some of the best game actors in the biz working it, including Steve Blum, aka Spike from Cowboy Beebop in this game as a grizzled Sniper expert+ITS WARHAMMER 40K! If you love the franchise like I do you will be splooging at all the detail, lore, and awesome stuff that helps build upon the license and makes you giddy just to feel like youre in the universe of W40KCon: -Graphics are great overall, but there is some serious texture quality that is left to be desired, like the ground for instance-While the maps are expansive and fun to explore they repeat them CONSTANTLY in the game. It gets repeitive doing the same maps over and over, but it's the quality of the gameplay and the map design that save this unfortunate problem-Cant respec skill tree :(-Still suffers from bugs. Nothing major, but there are occasional animation bugs where units may get stuck or cant move, and enemies who get killed may fly in circles around the map. It's actually kind of funny when you see that one though-Along with repeating maps the missions themselves feel very repetitive after a while. It's the differing enemy types and awesome loot drops that encourage you to play these and save this unforunate repetition-While the writing is passable by W40K fans, most people will see it as stock and cliche. It really is the setting and license that hold it up. The characters are memorable and likeable enough, but fairly one dimensional in personality and you really need to listen to a LOT of their dialog to feel investedOVERALL: FantasticI mean no exageration when I award this a 9.5/10 as a W40K fan. As an RTS/RPG fan, I award it an 8.5 for those not familiar with W40K. An excellent game none the less and one of my favorite games of all time and my favorite RTS alongside StarCraft II. An easy buy. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A Unique Blend of RTS and RPGPros:A great Warhammer 40K experience. You can tell the developer cared for and respected the Warhammer IP. They did a great job of delving into the 40K lore and made it accessible for everyone.It's a great co-op experience. Playing through the campaign with a friend was extremely enjoyable.Even though it is now starting to get dated, the game still looked great. Lots of graphical options.Plenty of variance in enemy units and environments. It takes a while before it starts to feel repetitive.Aside from the campaign there is also PVP and AI Multiplayer, and a wave survival co-op mode called The Last Stand.Neutral:I'm ashamed to admit that I haven't played the original Dawn of War. That being said I really enjoyed having the small squads with heroes. Managing hero abilities and moving squads kept me quite busy, and the lack of micromanaging was a breath of fresh air. That being said I'm sure it's not everyone's cup of tea.Cons:The online multiplayer community is slowly shrinking, as would be expected as a game gets older. Finding well matched games is only going to get harder and harder.21:9 displays are supported, however, Some of the UI and loading screen are bugged or don't display correctly. Obviously won't effect most people, but it's kind of a big deal to people with ultrawides. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(The online modes should be played exclusively on DoW II Retribution though as that has ALL the factions and the majority of the community.)+Fantastic combat with great enemy variety, boss battles, special enemy types, and lots of guns, powers, and toys to play around with+Huge open maps meant for exploration to find loot and other goodies as well as mop up any enemies to rack the experience points.+Decent mission variety with story missions being the most focused with optional Assassination and Defense missions to spice it up+The voice acting is SUPERB with some of the best game actors in the biz working it, including Steve Blum, aka Spike from Cowboy Beebop in this game as a grizzled Sniper expert+ITS WARHAMMER 40K! If you love the franchise like I do you will be splooging at all the detail, lore, and awesome stuff that helps build upon the license and makes you giddy just to feel like youre in the universe of W40KCon: -Graphics are great overall, but there is some serious texture quality that is left to be desired, like the ground for instance-While the maps are expansive and fun to explore they repeat them CONSTANTLY in the game. It gets repeitive doing the same maps over and over, but it's the quality of the gameplay and the map design that save this unfortunate problem-Cant respec skill tree :(-Still suffers from bugs. Nothing major, but there are occasional animation bugs where units may get stuck or cant move, and enemies who get killed may fly in circles around the map. It's actually kind of funny when you see that one though-Along with repeating maps the missions themselves feel very repetitive after a while. It's the differing enemy types and awesome loot drops that encourage you to play these and save this unforunate repetition-While the writing is passable by W40K fans, most people will see it as stock and cliche. It really is the setting and license that hold it up. The characters are memorable and likeable enough, but fairly one dimensional in personality and you really need to listen to a LOT of their dialog to feel investedOVERALL: FantasticI mean no exageration when I award this a 9.5/10 as a W40K fan. As an RTS/RPG fan, I award it an 8.5 for those not familiar with W40K. An excellent game none the less and one of my favorite games of all time and my favorite RTS alongside StarCraft II. An easy buy. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am just going to take a minute and write down a few thoughts I have had about this game as well as the additional games in this entire franchise. Because it is on a sale at this particular time I am jotting this down, I see from time to time a lot of people who wonder if they should get this game. The quick and easy answer is of course a most definite YES!, and I think for two very good reasons.I will go ahead and put as the #1 reason is that, given how long this game has been out, the developers Relic Entertainment is in my opinion one the best video game development studios to have ever come along. They have done such an incredible job with the way they made this game. Everything from the production values to the voice over acting is just a perfect example of putting big budget resources to good use. Another thing about this is, if you take a moment to look at the news and announcements pages for these games, Relic  is supporting this series and franchise to its fullest extent. There are lots of updates and general postings being made about these games on a constant basis to this day. Good communication with your player base goes a loooong way to helping people make good decisions about what games they should buy.The #2 reason I could recommend getting this series and games, is that the level of polish and overall feel of the games themselves is very top notch. These games run extremely well across a huge variety of PC configurations, low end systems to the very latest PC's. Along with this is that these games play very good without huge game-breaking bugs ruining your playing experience, seems like Relic did a great job with making sure as many bugs were taken care of before they released this series a long time ago, in general I found that all of Relic's older games including CoH, The Homeworld series, etc. were done very well.Some of the other things I enjoy about this series is that while I don't know a whole lot about the Warhammer Universe, I thought the story and characters are good enough to be interesting. Great campaign play, Good multiplayer action, and just altogether a solid, nicely done game series.And lastly, I should go ahead and mention specifically that the DoW II games are just slightly different from the original W40K DoW series. The original DoW series had a classic C&C base-building, resource gathering model while the DoW II series switches over and gets rid that in favor of a squad based, heroes model.Some people were surprised at the change, some liked it while others didn't, in my opinion it looked as if they wanted to go the other direction and that was fine. I would recommend in fact that anybody who wonders what the big difference is, is to maybe watch a youtube game review/let's play video that way you could see for yourself and decide that way because no one but you can decide if you would like that or not.

A Unique Blend of RTS and RPGPros:A great Warhammer 40K experience. You can tell the developer cared for and respected the Warhammer IP. They did a great job of delving into the 40K lore and made it accessible for everyone.It's a great co-op experience. Playing through the campaign with a friend was extremely enjoyable.Even though it is now starting to get dated, the game still looked great. Lots of graphical options.Plenty of variance in enemy units and environments. It takes a while before it starts to feel repetitive.Aside from the campaign there is also PVP and AI Multiplayer, and a wave survival co-op mode called The Last Stand.Neutral:I'm ashamed to admit that I haven't played the original Dawn of War. That being said I really enjoyed having the small squads with heroes. Managing hero abilities and moving squads kept me quite busy, and the lack of micromanaging was a breath of fresh air. That being said I'm sure it's not everyone's cup of tea.Cons:The online multiplayer community is slowly shrinking, as would be expected as a game gets older. Finding well matched games is only going to get harder and harder.21:9 displays are supported, however, Some of the UI and loading screen are bugged or don't display correctly. Obviously won't effect most people, but it's kind of a big deal to people with ultrawides. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun RTS game focusing the taking and holding of strategic points rather than base building. Lots of fun, weird, Warhammer 40,000 color. Single player is pretty fun though back in the day the multiplayer is what I sunk all my time into. Not sure if the community is still there. But worth picking up if you're a Warhammer fan.

												Having been completely obsessed with the first DoW game for years and putting in countless hours into online ranked and frantic base building and huge battles, DoW 2 came as a massive suprise to me. Although I prefer the first game, I can appreciate the change in direction and am enjoying the campaign so far. I do feel this game is a little tedious at times (I find myself dipping into it for an hour and coming back another time) but maybe this is because, I feel, this is a game that is much more catered to a more casual approach rather than 50 minute, off the scale RTS stratergy battles. Overall, seeing as I'd give DoW a 10/10, I feel DoW 2 deserves a 6.5. It's quite fun and the customising of your commanders is cool, but I feel like once I've completed the campaign they'll be little in the way to keep me coming back for more.Here's to DoW3 and the return of base building. Hurrah!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey you! Yes you! Would you like to command a squad in an epic battle against countless enemies across a subsector? Well in Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War 2 you can do just that! in this game you play as a force commander of the Blood Ravens Space Marines and you lead a small team of elite soldiers in defence of the Blood Ravens recruiting worlds (aka homeworlds) in the Aurealia sub-system. Now gameplay wise, this game is a great example of squad based tactics done in a reasonable fashion due to the hordes of enemies you have to face down with just a hand full of men. The only problem i have with the gameplay is that it does away with the base building of the previous Dawn of War but if you look at this game as if it were a plot sequal and not a gameplay sequal then the game is actually rather good.I fully reccomend this game to anyone who likes a nice good fast-paced RTS that requires you to think on your feet and look at everything with a tactical eye.

												More of an RPG than an RTS and with crap multiplayer as a result, I'd advise anyone to avoid this unless all they want out of it is a decent campaign. Even then you'll encounter plenty of bugs that can screw you over, like a squad being too stupid to stop attempting to use an item or ability they can't seem to ♥♥♥♥ing figure out how to do which will glue them to the ground and leave you with only 3 squads to complete a mission you'll likely then have to restart. Mele squads will sit there twiddling their thumbs in the middle of battle and ranged squads will follow the enemy and get caught in mele, because ♥♥♥♥ proper unit logic.It looks good enough for its time if not pretty good. The textures are in Relic's typical crap low-res and I've heard sound assets clearly used in Company of Heroes so its certainly not an aesthetic masterpiece. Just don't buy anything from Relic. They're like EA, if morphed into a development team. Cheapskate buggy low-res DLC spamming♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For once, a good Warhammer 40k game! Where should I start? This game focuses on its singleplayer campaign rather than the (rather unattended) multiplayer, but I'm okay with that. The characters are well written (I'm pretty sure we're supposed to hate Avitus, but I hate Cyrus), the story is brilliant, and the gameplay is immensely entertaining. Everything you do has a ""feel"" to it, as if it matters. Every mission felt like you actually accomplished something; every boss killed giving you a sense of triumph and honour.The final mission was lackluster, however. The final boss in said mission was easier to kill than the first boss. In fact, the whole ending portion was extremely rushed, expecting you to waste time repeating the exact same ""defend the array"" missions for hours before executing the final mission. Besides that, I would give this game a solid 8.5/10. I would certainly recommend this.			",163,9,0,14,8,3,35

												For those expecting a sequel to Dawn of War be prepared to be slightly disappointed because the threads of similarity are very thin. Yes it’s based in the 40K universe, Space Marines battling Orks etc. But that is it, Dawn of War 2 is a game in its own right, you will not be amassing squads of soldiers capturing strategic locations to earn more points so you can build more units faster. In fact the main emphasis will be around a small group of rock hard units which you will take (or not) on missions amass experience and hopefully pick up wargear. Dawn of War was a RTS pure and simple, Dawn of War 2 is a cross between RTS and RPG. I enjoyed playing the game in its own right and would highly recommend it for both RTS, RPG and 40K fans.

												This game is a fantastic RTS where you can play the fantastic single player or multiplayer. In the singleplayer you take control of the Blood Ravens chapter of space marines as battle your way across three different planets attempting to stop any threat to humanity. In the multiplayer you can play as any of four races (Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, and Tyranids) and attempt to get more victory points than your opponent or to destroy their base. Along with these modes there is also the Last Stand mode where you and two other players can each take control one of 3-5 (Depends on if you have Chaos Rising and Retribution) different ""heroes"" and fight off waves of AI controlled units. In general, if you like RTS games you should buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really good, yet simple RTS. The campaign is really neat, dynamic, and engaging. The minute you feel the game becomes repetitive a new element is added, and as soon as you feel that your game is playing too long, it comes to one of these, or draws out to an end. A great way to throw an RTS together in an RPG fashion, and multiplayer is great and was saved from the horrendous experience that was dealing with GFWL. The singleplayer campaign can be played as a co-op, and there are survival and PvP multiplayer modes. Anyone whos a fan or newcomer of the Warhammer 40,000 Universe should love this game, as it was also well executed with wonderful graphics and audio. The soundtrack is great, but as all do, it eventually gets old. Without bugging people, both campaigns reteach you how to play, making this a great start or start-and-stop for new RTS players. The base game can out plenty of hours, infact just getting the first campaign playthrough alone can easily take over 12 hours, and the DLCs are a great extension to the story of the game!

												For none-tabletop players: 9 of 10 stars.For all those of you, who love playing the mix of strategy games and RPG's, its an awesome game.You can choose a race like Space Marines (gen-manipulated super soldiers in the heaviest armors you can imagine), orkz (big, green and tons of aggression), the imperial Army ( normal humans, throw-away-units, but like a mass army, they overrun every enemy) and many others.While playing, your units gain experience and level up. So you can raise their stats and change the equipment of every hero in your squad.The game is split up in more or less 15 missions, individualized for each of the races.Otherwise you can play the ,,last stand"", where you and 2 other players try to survive 20 waves of enemys.Last aspect of the game is the multiplayer mode, where you can play solo or in team against other players.For tabletop players: 7 of 10 stars.Of course the game is still epic. But there are a few bad mistakes in the game, which let your smile disappear....Much of the equipment isn't codexconform, there are characters and Chapters that doesn't exist, an exterminatus that isn't an exterminatus ((it's an overkill in game.....first thousands of lances, and then a magmabomb which is much bigger than usual)(and although it's an planet with a great flora and fauna, there are no virusbombs)).Ok, this could be called pedantically, but if you know the codex and the rulebook, you will notice theese things wether you like or not...In spite of everything i advise you to buy this game ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												LONG REVIEW, WITH TL,DR AT THE END.I did not play the previous Warhammer 40k RTS games before Dawn of War II, yet I'm aware how different they are and I understand why some may not like Dawn of War II as the next evolution of the Dawn of War series. It's true, it is completely different, through that's no reason for hate or prejudgement. Dawn of War II on it's own is a fantastic game, I risk to say maybe ageless to be picked up again years after for it's campign, and if you don't expect an FPS game to be TPS, you'll realize if everything else other than the perspective is marvelously done, you have a great game.The same applies to Dawn of War II. It has left behind base building completely, the entire campign is leading a relatively small elite force, in a gameplay setting that is equal to classic RTS games, plus you have the cover system from Company of Heroes, and a lot RPG elements.

												A really good, yet simple RTS. The campaign is really neat, dynamic, and engaging. The minute you feel the game becomes repetitive a new element is added, and as soon as you feel that your game is playing too long, it comes to one of these, or draws out to an end. A great way to throw an RTS together in an RPG fashion, and multiplayer is great and was saved from the horrendous experience that was dealing with GFWL. The singleplayer campaign can be played as a co-op, and there are survival and PvP multiplayer modes. Anyone whos a fan or newcomer of the Warhammer 40,000 Universe should love this game, as it was also well executed with wonderful graphics and audio. The soundtrack is great, but as all do, it eventually gets old. Without bugging people, both campaigns reteach you how to play, making this a great start or start-and-stop for new RTS players. The base game can out plenty of hours, infact just getting the first campaign playthrough alone can easily take over 12 hours, and the DLCs are a great extension to the story of the game!

												LONG REVIEW, WITH TL,DR AT THE END.I did not play the previous Warhammer 40k RTS games before Dawn of War II, yet I'm aware how different they are and I understand why some may not like Dawn of War II as the next evolution of the Dawn of War series. It's true, it is completely different, through that's no reason for hate or prejudgement. Dawn of War II on it's own is a fantastic game, I risk to say maybe ageless to be picked up again years after for it's campign, and if you don't expect an FPS game to be TPS, you'll realize if everything else other than the perspective is marvelously done, you have a great game.The same applies to Dawn of War II. It has left behind base building completely, the entire campign is leading a relatively small elite force, in a gameplay setting that is equal to classic RTS games, plus you have the cover system from Company of Heroes, and a lot RPG elements. This, as is, works freaking great. You expect it be a base building resource gathering army building game, well it's not, and that's no reason to hate it (reacting to the negative reviews).The gameplay itself is fluid, smart. Tactics, strategies, adapting to new situations and changing (destroyable) enviromentis vital to success, and can be greatly different from playthrough to playthrough, from player to player, depending on the playstyle, RPG build (skill tree and equipment that drasticly change your squad) you choose.The graphics are fantastic up to this day, even if the game can be considered ""somewhat aged"" in 2016, if someone would ask me to pick a classic RTS (classic as in not 10000000000 units at once Total War, more like Command and Conquer used to be)  with the best looks, I'd pick Dawn of War 2 today, even over Company of Heroes 2 that came after it from the same company.

												After having a blast with the original Dawn of War (review link) I decided to pick up the sequel, and I'm glad that I did.The Blood Ravens are back to dispense Space Marine justice once again, and this time it's personal!I don't mean that they have actual personal investments in the story or anything though, this is Warhammer after all.The main difference this time around is that you only control a small number of hero squads (usually 4) in each level, so the focus is far more on squad management and tactics than the previous game. The previous game had some of that too, but definitely a lot of economy and base building too. None of that here though, this is purely a combat game.Your heroes level up as they purge the xenos (that's Space Marine for killing just about everything) and each level up grants them a passive stat boost, 2 skill points and access to better gear (which drops randomly from enemies you kill, almost like an ARPG, but fortunately not quite as frequently).These skill points (and your choice of weapon type and accessories) are your primary means of customization, and you can spend them on 4 attributes. Health, Ranged, Melee and Energy. The first 3 are self-explanatory, and Energy just gives you more ""mana"" to use your abilities in battle. What elevates this system to something far more strategic though, is that specific levels in an attribute can give very specific effects. For example, putting 3 points in Energy could unlock an additional accessory slot or allow your units to equip plasma rifles.There aren't enough skill points to get everything though, as the maximum level is 20 (for your units anyway, I've seen enemy AI with level 27 units... I hate it when games do that). This means that you'll have to decide how to develop your units quite early on, and with no way to respec them and a total of 6 (steady) party members unlocked as the game progresses it is possible that you screw up your build and will have a harder time.In general the game is pretty fair though, and as long as you don't split up your squad or rush into enemy fire unprepared (which will 'suppress' your squad, drastically lowering its movement speed) you should be okay. There is a range of difficulty settings too, though this can't be changed once you start your campaign.I personally went through the game on the lowest difficulty setting, Recruit, and felt sufficiently challenged (lost 2 optional missions, which I was then able to redo at a later time).The story is the standard 40k fare. Sub-sector Aurelia is important to every 40k race, and as the Imperium presence is overrun with Orks the Blood Ravens are called in. This quickly escalates into a conflict against the insidious Eldar and relentless Tyranid as well.In general I had a great time with this game, and I'd definitely recommend it.You're still only able to play as the Space Marines, and they're still stupidly serious about everything, but as a power fantasy they definitely deliver.

												Warhammer 40000 Dawn of War II is definitely the game for anyone who loved 40k and RTS. Its features Team Management and Wider World Exploration / Travelling over Planets, which looks better than that in Dawn of War games. Modifying the Same Crew to your own kill team is totally customized and user-friendly. The Process is also smooth that I'm like commanding an elite team and it has better and more realistic graphics. I really enjoyed it, good work!			",2,0,0,0,0,0,6

""None can stop the crusade of the righteous.""-Captain Davian Thule, Blood Ravens Commander, Sub-sector AureliaI recently replayed Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II from Relic Entertainment & THQ/SEGA.  I can gladly report that it still has the magic it did back in 2009.  Remarkably to this day it remains the most quintessential Warhammer experience to be found in videogaming, arguably tied with the action title, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine.  I doubt DoW2 will be knocked from that top spot by either Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide or the upcoming Total War entry to the IP.  Not sure whether or not to get my hopes up for Eternal Crusade.Note: This review is strictly for the original game; I've played the expansions but don't own them on Steam, and I'll make no comment on those expansions at the time of this writing except to say they're excellent; Chaos Rising adds diversity and great content.  I also did not engage the alternate game modes or multiplayer, only the single player campaign, so I make no comment on those here either.Of the four difficulty settings (Recruit, Sergeant, Captain & Primarch) I did a full playthrough on normal (Sergeant).  At this level, you can pretty much roll through the entire game without worrying overmuch about careful use of abilities or cover.  Not ideal for the RTS veteran but preferable to quickly absorb the campaign story.In this mission based campaign you're allowed one or more deployments per day.  Each mission is rated based on your performance in three categories (offense, survival & speed).  Ratings are also affected by certain side objectives.  Overall rating is presented to the player on campaign completion.Core gameplay is in squad dynamics.  There are: Force Commander, Tactical Marine, Devastator Marine, Assault Marine, Scout & Dreadnought.  I found the gameplay to have a balance of accessibility & depth.  Choosing the right squad composition & gear is half the battle in any mission; the other half requires timely use of cover & abilities.There's plenty of RPG progression mixed in, including gear, experience, attributes, traits and skills.  Gear is looted in mission or given as a reward; each squad can equip weapons, armor, accessories & consumables that should be tailored to the needs of each mission.  You'll gain 2 points per level to put into attributes (Stamina, Ranged, Melee, Energy) & earn strategy altering traits.Your 1st mission on any given day shouldn't be a Defense - those are more difficult to acquire high ratings in for some reason.  It's your performance in that 1st mission that determines how many extra deployments (none, one or two) you receive.  As such, make the 1st one strong to nab extra deployments.On that note, prioritize capturing Foundries over Comm Arrays or Imperial Shrines when possible, since of those three resources it's the Foundry that gives bonus to mission rating for the purpose of earning extra deployment.  Your ability to complete one or two extra missions per day is critical to keeping ahead of the enemy, especially late campaign.  As for the other two resources, I found the shrine bonus (a limited use per mission invulnerability shield) to be slightly more useful than the Comm Array (a targeted orbital strike, also limited use per mission).While Force Commander items like the drop pod beacon & other big area of effect attacks are fun & have a lot of flair, they should be used cautiously; they can & will hit squads too close to the target zone, potentially killing them outright (hurting your Survival score for that mission).Squads that frequently sit on the sideline can & will fall behind your regular squads in level a bit, even with the ""Librarium"" feature which lets the player discard spare items in exchange for experience.  Being lower in level, they'll also inevitably be comparatively undergeared, so rotate them a bit.My biggest issue with the game is no option for restarting a mission, no quicksave or quickload, no manual saving at all except between missions.  Once you load into that mission, you must complete it for better or worse; if you close the game, a day will have passed in your campaign automatically.  It's a bother if you mess up badly, since you have to live with the poor mission rating afterwards.  Of course plenty of players and developers embrace this tough stance towards saving/loading, as it raises the stakes!  Thankfully maps aren't so big as to draw out mission length too much.Story is very straightforward Warhammer fare, with a fun cast of squad leaders to walk you through it.  Visuals, audio & production value leave little to be said, although it does look a bit better than the average game from the year 2009.  There were no technical issues or bugs that I encountered.It's frustrating that the continuation of the Dawn of War series has been complicated by changing ownership & THQ's fate.  I'll believe there's a third installment in the works only when I can click the preorder button on Steam's store page!  WH40K:DoW2 is showing its age visually but is otherwise an admirably well crafted game that holds up to modern standards well enough; I highly recommend it for the excellent science fiction and solid RTS strategy - and obviously it's a must play for any Warhammer fan.

												The game that first took me down the rabbit hole that is WARHAMMER 40000, this is one terrific experience. Quick version: if you like WARHAMMER 40k, buy it. If you like RTS games, buy it. Long version: Dawn of War II is a tight-playing squad-based RTS that feels just right for my brain. The campaign is a ton of fun, with lots of loot to collect and abilities to unlock. You’ll want to tackle multiple playthroughs to try out different character builds. Deliciously campy and fun voice acting abounds. The multiplayer is terrific as well, plus the recent removal of the much hated Games For Windows Live makes it all the sweeter.Get the whole franchise package when it goes on cheap. You’ll get a solid 30 hours at least out of DOW II and its two excellent expansions and never look back.PURGE THE XENOS ",111,8,3,11,7,0,22

												I intially thought that this game was just going to be a way for 40k to advertise their movie or their board games with a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and alot of explosions. My friends, I was sadly mistaken. The amount of depth and effort put into this game is very apparent. The battlefield tactics are wonderfully designed and very balanced. The graphics and background to the worlds you explore are extremely well thought out and put together. Unlike most games, who either prioritize story telling or gameplay mechanic elements, the designers did an amazing job making both engaging and worthwhile. While you won't find hours upon hours of different gameplay in it's PvP multiplayer, it does come with a very interesting and well thought out PvE multiplayer that I personally enjoy playing with friends. Brings the glory of the Warhammer universe, the fun interactive style of the RTS genre, and the immersive graphics of the next gen engines together beautifully. Had fun, would love to see more content created for this game.   9/10			",78,10,0,17,11,0,13

												The difficulty comes from enemies having 2-20x the hitpoints of your units, bosses take so long to kill you just get bored and want to stop the game halfway through fighting them.  Your units can get knocked off the level and you won't be able to revive them.  Unlocking additional unit drops doesn't actually allow you to bring extra squads in the campaign. Controlling 10-11  Space Marines should be freeing instead of extremely tedious.Oh no I'm down to one marine, better just  have him run to the beacon and refill his squad then run over and revive the other guys so the others teleport in and then go fight some more.    Instead of just using ALL your marines at once you can only use X number of squads at a time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That horrible, festering mess is required to even play this game and if you haven't played a game infected with GFWL's poison in a while you will find: 1) You have to go through some procedure to recover your stupid GFWL account, once you do that you will be asked to UPDATE GFWL but 2) the in-game GFWL updater won't work, in fact, it might even hang during the update because ♥♥♥♥ you3) a manual update requires you to download Windows Live Marketplace (not Games for Windows Live because Microsoft tried to rebrand their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as pigshit at some point)4) in order to install Windows Live Market place, you have to first install Windows live id sign in assistant, which won't install. ...in other words TRYING TO INSTALL THIS GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATE IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIMEGames for Windows Live Must DieThe good news is that apparently Relic is working on patching this game so it can actually be played, which is a good thing for a game to be.

												With a improved engine and a redesign game, Dawn of War 2 take places in a slighly smaller scale from the orginal. Instead of constructing a base and pumping out marines and takes you command a small group of Space Marines as the attempt to get to the bottom of a mystery. You play a new Force Commander who is put in charge of an operations and must ""hold the area"" until assistance arrives in the form of a great Astartes fleet. You have no lines and while that normally bugs me in this instance its well done as you listen to your squad leaders speak amongst themselves and then look to you for orders. Good gear customization and tactics really do come into play in this game vs the original where you could just throw the book at them. Boss fights can get hairy and somtimes are stupidly difficult but with proper planning and tactics are winnable.  All and all i would say that i did enjoy this game i just wish they had included a bit more into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was absolutely blown away by this game. I never expected it to live up to the first. But I have never been to delightfully wrong. If you are looking for a copy past of the first title this isn't it. It's a completely new experience and all for the best. It's less RTS and more action RPG. You take control over a small kill team of Blood Raven Marines that as you progress can mix and match to adapt to various missions. The story was as solid as could be and the game play was fluid and beautiful. I spent countless hours on this one years back. And didn't hesitate to buy it again on Steam. An absolute must for ANY 40K fan new and old and worth a test drive for players who have no idea what 40K is all about.			",96,13,0,22,2,0,19

I use to play dawn of war 1 all the time when i was younger and it was just amazing and still is my favorite RTS of all time. I never got the last 2 expansions for DOW and wanted to relive the experence on steam but I saw dawn of war2 on sell and had to buy it. I wanted to like it but they changed the things that I loved about the first one.  Now it is NOT a bad game Its a bad sequel and im just kind of dissapointed with it. I wanted to build a base from the ground up and watch my army grow and kill everything in sight but instead you command a small squad....... Now I like the idea of heros but it just isnt the same.

												*Note This is from my experiences from playing the campaign.A total different type of strategy compared to Dawn of War as it narrows its gameplay to squad based tactics.I had a better experience playing this cooperatively in the campaign, as you have half of the units on the field. Insuring that you really have to stay together to survive. It can also feel somewhat repetitive as you battle, going over the same kill this boss/defend area jungle/desert/city map. But you also get a tons and tons of loot/wargear for your squads to use.Other points:- Visual wise, very flashy.- Can customise squads easily- The campaign is somewhat interesting, But you will be soon selecting missions to loot wargear than anything else. All in all, its is an OK game. Great two player co-op and good for players who are just learning the ropes of tactic RTS’s.			",180,41,0,41,12,0,28

												I don't really like RTS games because my base building somehow never worked. Of course, this was a decade ago and my coordination has gotten better. The primary reasons, though, that I tried Dawn of War 2 out was because there was no base building. This made the game very tactical and my units more valuable. I couldn't just produce more meat for the grinder without risking my important units.Oh and the story is pretty okay. Characters tend to be macho, but since I was using these characters over and over during battle, I've gotten attached to some. Even though your character, the Force Commander, never speaks, you feel like your doing something because the units ALWAYS compliment your leadership rather than their badass abilities.It's also a Wahmmer 40k game. THere's a lot of lore and what not, which makes me wonder why there hasn't been an RPG made yet.So... droning on....... It's a good game? 9/10.			",312,29,2,16,5,0,6

												I LOVE this game. It is basically the perfect mix of a RTS and a RPG and i dont really like RPG's. The game is very well done. i cant even think of something to complain about. In th story mode you could basically play forever if you dont play the final mission. You will stop getting rewards from the missions that are worth anything but the gameply is whats it about.Get it if you a Warhammer fan obviously and if you are RTS fan. *there is no base building. Just your sqauds.*			",34,2,0,0,2,0,7

												I am a huge fan of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. My first exposure to this world was the original Dawn of War franchise, and I loved how they tweaked the traditional RTS style with a new squad based style.With Dawn of War 2 they did it again; the game wasn't going to adhere to standardised conventions. While never fully either an RTS or RPG, it contained the best of these elements. Think party based RPG with loot drops!The game allows you to appreaciate the Space Marine as it should be - a small squad of super human soldiers cutting its way through a multitude of enemies to achieve its objective. No hunkering behind defenses, no building a bigger army than necessary. You are dropped in the centre of the action and you have to literally carve your way through with bolter and chainsword.The story is relatively straight forward, but you will be constantly drawn back to the high paced visceral action and adrenaline rushing music. Nothing can relieve stress as effectively as dropping your assault marines on top of a cluster of enemies and making them go splash.			",39,0,0,10,3,0,8

												With a improved engine and a redesign game, Dawn of War 2 take places in a slighly smaller scale from the orginal. Instead of constructing a base and pumping out marines and takes you command a small group of Space Marines as the attempt to get to the bottom of a mystery. You play a new Force Commander who is put in charge of an operations and must ""hold the area"" until assistance arrives in the form of a great Astartes fleet. You have no lines and while that normally bugs me in this instance its well done as you listen to your squad leaders speak amongst themselves and then look to you for orders. Good gear customization and tactics really do come into play in this game vs the original where you could just throw the book at them. Boss fights can get hairy and somtimes are stupidly difficult but with proper planning and tactics are winnable.  All and all i would say that i did enjoy this game i just wish they had included a bit more into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*Note This is from my experiences from playing the campaign.A total different type of strategy compared to Dawn of War as it narrows its gameplay to squad based tactics.I had a better experience playing this cooperatively in the campaign, as you have half of the units on the field. Insuring that you really have to stay together to survive. It can also feel somewhat repetitive as you battle, going over the same kill this boss/defend area jungle/desert/city map. But you also get a tons and tons of loot/wargear for your squads to use.Other points:- Visual wise, very flashy.- Can customise squads easily- The campaign is somewhat interesting, But you will be soon selecting missions to loot wargear than anything else. All in all, its is an OK game. Great two player co-op and good for players who are just learning the ropes of tactic RTS’s.			",180,41,0,41,12,0,28

												When this first came out the Multiplayer was total garbage. Since then It has gotten better with the DLC. The core gameplay from the single player campain was a huge dissapointment when it first came out as well. People like me who have the orgional DoW I with its expansions were expecting more than 1 race to be avaible in the first release. Sadly there was not. We also hoped to get an updated RTS..Again this was not so. Instead we got a great squad based game with RPG Elements wich was somthing alot of people wanted to see happen via an expansion with the first game. Even with all these flaws and the redundent missions that you play over and over again I found it fun enough to get my money's worth out it. And the story isn't too shabby either. I give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Worthy of a playthrough.			",7,2,0,6,5,0,9

												I was absolutely blown away by this game. I never expected it to live up to the first. But I have never been to delightfully wrong. If you are looking for a copy past of the first title this isn't it. It's a completely new experience and all for the best. It's less RTS and more action RPG. You take control over a small kill team of Blood Raven Marines that as you progress can mix and match to adapt to various missions. The story was as solid as could be and the game play was fluid and beautiful. I spent countless hours on this one years back. And didn't hesitate to buy it again on Steam.

												An exellent game of bringing Dawn of War into the modern day strategy gaming style. Taking a view more like the board game, it allows you to use squads, and moderfy them depending on the gear which drops from monsters and the perks on levels. Varying from 4 different worlds and many different levels to cover in this, this certainly brings forth a cool and fun way to get involved in the Warhammer 40k universe: That there is only WAR!

												The game is not my favorite of all time but It is pretty good as a RTS game, the graphics could be nicer but they do not take away from the gameplay, the interface is pretty smooth and simplistic as well so that is a plus. The feature where you can trade in old gear or gear you simply do not want for extra experiance for your troops and heroes is a very nice addition to the game and helps you keep your inventory of stuff less cluttered and to level up your men faster to handle the challenges of the game. I do however wish that getting behind cover was easier with a larger squad, some troops it seems are bound to wind up in the open sometimes so a few extra points in health is nice but not vital to win the mission.I have not finished it yet but I do like the story so far and do recommend at least trying it out if there is a good sale even if you are new to RTS games.

												Relic Entertainment really outdid themselves when they came to making Dawn of War 2 and it's two expansion packs, Chaos Rising and Retribution. Simply put, I believe this to be the best strategy video game adaptation of the Warhammer 40,000 universe to date.The gameplay is best described as a hybrid of the original Dawn of War formula blended with elements from Company of Heroes. The visuals are exceptional, and stand up very well compared even with new releases. And like always with Relic, the sound and music is superb, drawing you completely into the setting and story with ease. Additionally, the two expansion packs, Chaos Rising and Retribution, add even more value to the original package, and are essential purchases if buying the game.By design, DoW2 (and expansions) is more like three games rolled into one. The Campaign mode (which can also be played co-operatively), a PvP Multiplayer mode and a Co-op Multiplayer mode known as ""The Last Stand"". All three components are similar in feel, but differ slightly in terms of gameplay, offering a unique experience for each game mode. The three modes are all extremely fun in their own right, and combined have provided me with years worth of entertainment.To sum up, Dawn of War 2 (plus expansions) is one of the best strategy games ever made. If the game even slightly piques your curiosity, I recommend you should buy it. You won't regret it. FOR THE EMPEROR! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn of war 2 is very different to its four predecessors as it takes away building a base and army to win the game and leaves us with a small group of units that can be customized and upgraded, however this does not make it bad, if you don't compare it to the other DOW games DOW2 is a fun experience with a solid story and is enhanced if you get chaos rising.

												I played DOW I and loved the strategy, the units and the low need for buildings. However, I don't think I enjoy DOW II as much (But I do like Last Stand). I believe it's mainly due to the map and gameplay repetition. PROS1. LoreMore Warhammer 40K lore in game. Interesting story except for the ""Unknown Primarch"" nonsense. No surprise that it's going to be Chaos orchestrating everything in the end.2. Less ""buildy"" MultiplayerNo need to play base tetris or resource farmer. Mostly combat.3. Cut ScenesVery short. Not exactly a cinematic but it's okay. I would have preferred a full 3-minute cinematic. 4. CharactersQuite interesting to see all the different characters from a. Force Commanderb. Tactical Marinec. Heavy Assaultd. Scoute. Assault Marinef. Dreadnaughtg. Librarian (Psyker)CONS1. Campaign Map and GameplaySo repetitive. Go to point A, kill the Boss. Rinse, repeat. How do I describe the monotonous feeling that I get when I can predict what I am going to do on the next map already? I know that there is going to be a few ""yellow circles"" telling me to attack those locations and kill everything there. I also know that I am going to kill a boss.The rare defense maps are pretty boring too. Defend the generators from being attacked. There. That sums up the defense maps.The objective is just to kill, kill, kill. No escort missions, no tech upgrades, no mixup, no buildup. I'm sorely tempted to just skip the optional missions just to create more chaos so that I can have some fun.2. ""Unloading""Very long unload times. Posted in the forums, seems it's a forced save replay that happens.3. Multiplayer Unit BuildingIt takes too long to wait for sufficient resources to build a T3 unit. Even if you control ALL the resource nodes, the time required is just way too long. In a 1v1 or 3v3, you can't wait to build a full army. Don't forget that I've not even added in the upgrades on each unit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best RTS Ive played in a long time...Pros:-SciFi setting.-Highly tactical: normally you got to choose 4 squads out of 6 different units, each with its own abilities.-Highly customazible: the units progression is amazing: experience - skills, armors, weapons, extras, etc.-Strategical decisions: the campaign mode requires to complete different goals that will affect the developing of your next missions, depending on the order and the amount of failures you got.-Plot: Im not a Warhammer fan, and the story was still quite entartaining.-Graphics: If you got a machine to run it, it is pretty. Otherwise, still looks good ;PCons:-Speed: The combats are supposed to be fast and brutal, but in order to have a proper tactical battle, you have to slow down your actions, go back take reinforcements, order your units, etc... otherwise you get into a chaotic quarrel with little tactical actions.That said, I'd give it 8/10. Have a blast! For the Emperor!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun game, if you go in with the right mindset. Campaign mode is Space Marines only, and you get 4 (of 6 you can choose from) Hero squads to take through the campaign. Upgrade their wargear, upgrade their stats/skills, bring down the wrath of the Emperor on da Orkz and the Tyranids.If you end up liking it, pick up the Chaos Rising expansion.If you prefer the option to micro larger armies and♥♥♥♥♥♥ look into Dawn of War 2 Retribution which lets you swap out your heros for more resources to call in reinforcements with.

												Difficult review to write this. I loved the orginal DOW and I rememeber when DOW2 came out I was a little dissapointed by the change of game style (see how I get of with DOW 3!). This is more a squad based tactical game with some RPG elements but it eventually grew on me. It's only my second play through since I bought it on release and I've got to say I enjoyed it more than my re-run of DOW. The missions do get a bit samey when you depart from the scripted ones, they re-use the maps, a lot. But they are just so damn fun. There retreat system stops you from any catastrophic failures, I dont think I ever lost a mission. I enjoyed the customization of my squad and hero charactor. Theres just a lot more to do to keep your interest, chosing your weapons armour and payload definately gives u a more invested interest in your squad and adds to the experience.Im sure this game will suffer from bad reviews as a knock on of any fallout from DOW3 (internet nerds are relentless) but if your a warhammer fan and liked DOW and haven't tried this, then get it and stick with it. 8.5/10			",75,7,0,10,1,0,13

												One of the best RTS game series i have ever played, they are all good from the first to the last Warhammer game, with even a good variety between their titles.First one works as a classic RTS, with matches/single player campaigns where you build structures, gather resources conquering nodes and recruit/upgrade troops to attack your enemies's base, in order to win.Second one, this one and the Retribution, have a bit different RTS strategy in the singleplayer mode: you control squads of marines with different skills and utility, and accomplish some missions in the area where you drop in, mostly of the time requires you to kill every alien being, even if you are outnumbered, all of this with an exp system that upgrades the squad captains and item drops that improve their stats. The Retribution is the same thing, but with many more campaigns where you can play any race/faction existing in the DoW universe.Both of these games have also a co-op mode that is called The Last Stand, where you choose a unit from any race (in DoW II you need to buy the Chaos Expansion to play one race, and a DLC to play another unit in the DoW II: Retribution), team up with other 2 players and survive as many possible waves you can, using many skills to either control areas, destroy enemies, support allies, etc.And the last one, ""Space Marine"", is a fighting game in third person where you'll take part as a space marine in a war against the Orks and Eretics (obviously, you'll be outnumbered here too)As i said, every game of the serie is great, but for a new RTS style i suggest you trying this out, and then move on the other games to get the emperor's blessing, like i did.FOR THY EMPEROR			",334,41,5,35,10,3,35

												Dlc policy is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥but other then that its worth your time if you liked dawn of war 1. 7/10But i suspose since this is a review i will have to justify my 7/10 rating so here we go, while the game is basicly a simplication of dawn of war 1 it has its moments now i know your thinking ""but why is it simplifed"" well base building is gone, resources are gone so theres no points to capture other then the reinforment points, but besides that the game at its core is still dawn of war the combat is engaging and fun so they did their job on that another thing to point out is that missions can be done quickly however to counteract that you can capture optional points which gives you benifits like extra experince when finishing a mission, the abillty to place down sentry turrets and bomboardments, now lets get onto the main point on why i gave it a 7/10 because from my review most of you are thinking i'm having a lot of fun from this game (which i am) so why aren't you giving it a 10/10, well to answer that question this game does have flaws its not a perfect game like most of this review would have you belive lets go into detail about this, well for starters late game (please note my hours do not reflect my experince with this game most of my time was spent offline due to my internet being down) is very hard if you do not know what you are doing (game was played on sergent difficuty) how you spend your stat points early game will determine how hard the game will be late game if you spent your points mindlessly like i did the game will become extermely difficult, but other then that this game does its job well providing an rts experince while the core is the same as dawn of war 1 it innovates enough to consider your money and time.

												As a lover of strategy games, I have to say this game is quite a blast (and refreshing for those who are used to base-building strategy games).This was my first time playing it so I think I will bother to describe my experience from the very beggining.First, the campaign, the characters have base personalities and they don't strave from them, instead they develop while you advance in the game, side missions are not just side missions, since characters themselves give it some thought and weight after you complete it.The gameplay is fun, quick and easy to catch up with, it's nothing complicated, you can take your time to complete missions, capture important buildings and wipe everyone out, or take the easy way out and blast your guns through hordes of enemies right to the objective. The game rewards you for not having your teammates defeated in the whole mission (they can be revived), the amount of enemies downed and the time you took to complete said mission.The upgrade system is fairly understandable, it could be your usual MMO if it wasn't because even though stats don't increase much, they still matter in battle, and special abilities unlocked while you level up help turn the tides on battles that you wouldn't even dream of accomplishing without said abilities.The Last Stand? Well, now that's a fun thing, I haven't catched the hang of it (seriously, first 3 times playing it and I got squashed in them all, except for one with a level 20 guy), but I'm getting there. The gamemode itself is interesting albeit challenging, and it can be fun if you have people who can play correctly, and are up to flaws. It just boils down to tolerance, but, that gamemode, no questions asked, is extremely fun.I haven't tried multiplayer, but I have high expectations.I would *absolutely* buy this game if I had the money, it's amazing.

												Dawn Of War II. The sequel of to DOW which in turn had about 3 expansions. If you've played the original and are coming into this blind, then be ready for a shock. This doesn't play like a traditional RST game. In fact, it plays more like a Dota style squad based managment game.If you enjoy that kind of game, you'll probably have a right old time with this. The sound design is fantastic. All the guns sounds powerful and weighty, and when someone dies, it doesn't sound good. The graphis also, are a huge step up from the rather dated visuals of the original. The story this time around isn't as memorable as the first, but a decent romp none the less. The Multiplayer still has a solid community also. However with all that said, I would reccomend skipping this one and buying 'Retribution'. It doesn't require DOWII or it's expansion to play, and includes a lot more content, and a better story. Final thoughts: Great game, but made redudent by it's superior sequal. If you're fan of squad based, DOTA style gameplay, you might want to pic it up anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warhammer® 40,000: Dawn of War в свое время был жутко интересной стратегией, с разнообразными расами, интересными юнитами, ну и конечно же, затягивающей и эпичной кампанией. Что бы дать достойный отпор живому игроку, приходилось детально изучать понравившуюся расу, использовать сильные её качества и уметь прикрывать недостатки. В Dawn of War II от стратегии мало что осталось(тупой захват стратегических точек + убить босса), развернуться негде, да и выбор, за кого играть, теперь стал не таким уж большим, Зато графон стал очень приятен глазу, смерти - еще более жестокими(за что мы все и любим эту серию), взрывы техники тоже выглядят очень здорово. Кампания хоть и интересная, но не дотягивает до уровня первых Вархамеров. Я, как фанат серии, конечно поиграл и прошел с удовольствием игру, но сомневаюсь, что она понравится человеку, обычному любителю стратегий.			",360,39,13,54,20,2,50

												Why Relic, Why?They took Dawn of War 1 which was perfect, ruined the engine and gameplay, and called it Dawn of War 2. The game looks visually stunning, and sounds great, but that's all it has going for it. I am starting to think Relic don't do sequels well, because this game is a slap in the face for DoW fans. Think how bad C&C4 was compared to C&C3. That's how bad DoW2 is.			",454,20,6,11,8,3,38

												Warhammer 40k DoW2 is a good game with a nice story line, however I think the game is rubbish due to the devs removing base building. I remember a while back the demo had it where you could build an entire base, research new equipment and be tactical with your resources. Now, you just spam whatever unit you want and just sit on your butt until you get the res to build some more. After the fact I would have rather saved my money to buy a base building game instead of a rush and crush game like this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a big fan of the warhammer 40k games. Loved the first game and it's expansions. I for one found this game a little odd with it's unit size and almost RPG approach compared to the first. I was reluctant to give it a go. However, i'm glad to say that i didn't.This game provides the player with an interesting and engaging story. One of which spans multiple planets and races. The characters in the game are also steller. No two characters are the same, both in aesthetics and functionallity. In terms of difficulty. The game certainlly provides the player with some level of challenge, even in the lower difficulty settings. But this can be made eaiser in online coop (Yes, this game has coop!).This game, as staited above, has online coop, which players control different units within the squad during the story mode. The game also come with two multiplayer modes. One of them being a hord style(""hold them off for a long as possible"") mode, and the other being a normal online competative mode.Finally. It's the Emperors will, that you purchase this game!(Also a side note. This game came with a copy of chaos rising already).			",170,15,3,16,3,2,21

However Dawn of War 3 is coming out so you might need to wait for that. Overall great game but outdated			",71,14,0,13,15,1,22

												I'm am giving my honest opinion.I don't like Dawn of War II because it's an squat based game instead of Dawn of war 1 which was an building based RTS. I liked the way building used to fly from the sky crashing down to the ground ready to be build. After building a base you would create an army to fight off another army that could be from a different kind of race which also got its own abilities etc.But the point is, I hoped that Dawn of War II would be the same good game as its predecessor. but its none of the sort.  Dawn of War® II gives you an small squad putting you down a path which is making the game more story based and thus giving you less freedom in your decision making. The purpose of this was to make you feel more connected whit the protagonists. Than i thought ""Why would Relic fix something that isn’t broken?"". Dawn of War was a good game and a true RTS. Dawn of War II is good looking but completely different from what it should have been. The concept... completely destroyed. And i was very disappointed. ",80,12,0,14,15,1,15

In the grim darkness of the far future there is only Sync Error: please restart your gameI used to play a lot of tabletop 40K, and after playing the first Dawn of War a few years ago I was looking forward to another instalment. I wish I hadn't bothered: stabbing myself in both eyes with sporks while gargling lukewarm badger diarrhea would have been a much more enjoyable and productive use of my time. Unfortunately I can't get a refund as I put more than 2 hours into Last Stand mode before finding out that the rest of the game was completely broken, so I'm leaving this review instead in the hope that nobody else will make the same mistake.When I finally got around to loading up a Private Multiplayer game, I selected game options, invited a mate to play with and the game crashed. So I tried again, and it crashed. And again, and it crashed. A trip to Google later and someone said the only way they managed to get it to work at all was by manually selecting the races of all the CPU players, as leaving any of them on random meant - you guessed it - the game crashed. Colour me stunned.When I finally got into a game, I discovered that it was basically Dawn of War I adapted for short attention spans and low IQs. Base building? Gone. Resource management? Simplified to the point of pointlessness. Variety? You get 5 races to choose from, with the rest gated off behind so many pieces of DLC it would make EA say ""Hang on a minute, don't you think this is a bit of a rip-off?""I'm amused to note that apparently Dawn of War III will re-introduce some of the game mechanics that were removed. This is about as close as a game developer comes to admitting fault, but I've learned my lesson and I won't be buying it; I'll be saving my money for sporks and badger laxatives.If you value your money, your sanity or your time, stay well away from this game.

												Feels less strategic than Dawn of War 1. The lack of Listening Posts or otherwise meaningful fortifications makes map control a merry go round chase, which I have little patience for. The campaign bored me, and on two separate occasions I couldn't force myself to finish it.Buy Dawn of War 1 with expansions, add a good mod (DoWPro, Ultimate Apocalypse, IDH) and have fun.EDIT: To be sure, I have more hours clocked than steam is showing.

												Not a member of top-tier RTS games, but a sincere attempt to bring Warhammer 40K to the genre. The Dawn of War series struggles from one thing more than anything else. It's not Command and Conquer and it's not Starcraft. If you can accept that, and the extensive expansions you might need to acquire in order to play the preferred race, this game will likely keep you entertained for a number of hours. I found the campaign to be fine from a story standpoint, but often repetitive and a bit boring when it came to actual game play. The multiplayer mode was, oddly, lacking some level of immersion. The scale of the battles was quite underwhelming and while the resource acquisition was fine, the objectives were not enough to make up for an experience that was just not very... 40Kish. I can recommend this game for what it is, a 40K RTS. If you are seeking some RTS experience that immerses you for hours and really give you a new take on the genre, this really isn't the game you are looking for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looking to quench that long needed online warhammer game that so many want? Here you go!Pros: Dawn of war II is a game that involves you, a force commander of the Blood Ravens space marine chapter doing things for your Chapter (Avoiding spoilers) average space marine stuff right? Wrong. The campaign is a detailed, canon, and fun experience when played alone or with up to one friend and you can never be short of a good mission in the Campaign mode. Multiplayer is largely outdated by Dawn of war II Retributions multiplayer last stand and base multiplayer. Largely due to this you wont find hardly anyone online anymore on this game in particular. Cons: Sometimes I think of myself as repeating the missions but with diffrent objectives and stuff, although the campaign is good it ends up getting repetitive after a few playthroughs this being my 4th. In co-op campaign game ending bugs on connection and during matches is common, not to mention unresponsiveness to commands. Verdict: This game is a rock on solid for anyone who loves the Warhammer 40k franchise or just likes to shoot xenos in the name of the Emperor. You will find hours of enjoyment and replayability always wondering what new wargear you can earn again and some diffrent choices mid campaign, and you would be happy with the Co-op system that allows for 1 buddy to share Cyrus, Avitus, You, Thaddeus, and Tarkus with eachother.

												DOW 2's shift away from a RTS to something else, Real Time Tactical RPG maybe, took many DOW 1 fans by supprise. Many of them, myself included, felt betrayed and cheated. If I could have gotten my money back I would have. I am not saying DOW 2 is a bad game. It is just not what I would play or pay for and to call it an RTS was misleading. Reading more about Relic I think it was an intentianal money grab (my opinion). The developers should have called this Warhammer 40k (insert something other than Dawn of War 2) but they chose not to. While DOW 2 shares some simularities to DOW 1 the game play is so different it is a strech to call it a sequal. It would be like Die Hard 3 being shot in a film noir style and not displaying this in the film trailers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Squad based strategy set in one of the most interesting sci-fi / fantasy universes you will ever come across. Unlike the first dawn of war games it isn't a true base building RTS, base building only partially comes into the game in the retribution expansion.  This is honestly one of my favorite games and along with the chaos rising expansion, the best squad based game i have come across. Although this is largely due to the awesome setting of the 40k setting. Be very careful when buying this game, it originally came with Games For Windows Live (GFWL) and doesn't work without it. The same goes for Chaos Rising unfortunately. As GFWL is now dead the game does not work (As of 1st of march 2014) and hasn't for several months.  Retribution does work but I found it to be the least interesting of the three games, the campaign involves allot of spamming units and practically no recourse management. It came across to me as some RTS squad hybrid and achieved neither. Not sure about multiplayer in it though could be good. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoy this game and recommend it for those who are looking for a non-traditional RTS game.  It plays much differently from the first Dawn of War game, which is both a positive and a large negative.  When I first played the game, I was turned off by the fact that it was not like the first game at all, where you could have massive armies facing each other, upgrade your forces, and just summon a slew of Dreadnoughts if things weren't working with your 'subtle' approach.  However, once I examined the game on its own merits, I found that I enjoyed it very much.  You have to be careful with your units and determine what their strengths are (and what you want to be their strengths).I recommend playing it, at some point, on the hardest difficulty (Primarch).  The loot is better and the strategy aspect of the game becomes much more pronounced than it does on the lower difficulties (where a suicidal assault works because you're awesome).

												Incase you can't tell from the title, Dawn of War II is a Warhammer 40,000 game. If you don't know what that is you better look it up before you think about buying something with Warhammer attached to it,  they are not for everyone .It is also a Games for Windows Live Game as well as a Steam game, so if you want a game for its' multiplayer look somewhere else. Now... I'm going to break things down into ratings.Gameplay 9/10Very strategic strategy game, tactics will get you a lot more than sheer numbers or unit strength.Single-Player Campaign 10/10The Dawn of War II campaign is a mix between Horde Survival, plot and a RTS. And I'll be damned if it doesn't do it well. Dawn of War II is quite different from its predecessors. No longer is their extensive Base Building. Infact, in a Campaign mission you have NO BASE. You may have a location, a base you need to defend for a mission but it isn't yours. You can't build stuff from it. There are strategic locations scattered around the mission maps though. Your 'army' is divided into 4 squads. Throughout the campaign you will end up acquiring more than 4 squads but you can only deploy 4 squads to a mission. Each squad is unique, they have their own strategies and skills. The game has introduced a Experience system. This system is most noticeable in the Campaign. As you kill and kill, as well as complete missions your Squads will gain levels individually (to a maximum of level 20). With each level your squads gain two points to put in a talent tree of your choice. Most squads have certain trees that they can put enormous amounts of points and skill into, while others they can only put a few in because of previously stated differences in each Squads specialization. Also, you may chose the 'wargear' for each of your squads. Some of these wargear provide statistic bonuses and similar to the squad that has that item equiped. Others are weapons that will allow the squad to better fulfill a certain task. At the end of the day though, you can have considerable flexibility with you squads. Invest you points in the right talent tree and a Squad that is intended to fulfill 1 role a certain way can fulfill a different role in a different way. Customization is one of the primary elements that has been introduced in force in Dawn of War II compared to its' predecessors. An added bonus is that the Campaign is two player, so you can play through the Campaign with a friend (who has the game obviously). From experience, doing the Campaign in co-op is loads of fun.Multiplayer 0/10The Games for Windows Live was a huge hassal, and it was not a hard decision for almost the entire active Dawn of War II playerbase to switch over to Dawn of War II : Retribution. Retribution's multiplayer is through Steam, not Games for Windows Live (thank god).Graphics 8/10There are games just as old with better graphics, but that being said... the graphics are certainly not an eyesore.Audio 9/10Outstanding voicework all around. Very realistic sounds to be heard on the battlefield. Be it the sound of the last spent shell falling onto the ground or one of you squads talking to each other on the field. Music is good.All in all, great game but I would only recommend it for Warhammer 40k fans, particularly ones who have somebody to the play the campaign in Co-Op with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though I love RTS games, I always find myself a little lost commanding an emormous host.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I picked up DOW II, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  Commanding smaller groups and sheparding them through missions allows me to focus on best utilizing special abilities and keeping my men alive.  My only complaint pertains to the difficulty scale, once you get past the entry level difficulty the boss fights ramp up significantly.  This may just be a personal problem though and more experienced RTS players may find the additional challange enjoyable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a member of top-tier RTS games, but a sincere attempt to bring Warhammer 40K to the genre. The Dawn of War series struggles from one thing more than anything else. It's not Command and Conquer and it's not Starcraft. If you can accept that, and the extensive expansions you might need to acquire in order to play the preferred race, this game will likely keep you entertained for a number of hours. I found the campaign to be fine from a story standpoint, but often repetitive and a bit boring when it came to actual game play. The multiplayer mode was, oddly, lacking some level of immersion. The scale of the battles was quite underwhelming and while the resource acquisition was fine, the objectives were not enough to make up for an experience that was just not very... 40Kish. I can recommend this game for what it is, a 40K RTS. If you are seeking some RTS experience that immerses you for hours and really give you a new take on the genre, this really isn't the game you are looking for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I never really got into the DLC that much (and holy schmidt, there's a lot of DLC now), but I remember the co-op-able campaign being a very big highlight, as well as the accessibility of the multiplayer ""melee"" modes. The lack of dedicated harvesting/building units makes the fights very tactical and actiony. Hero units are a lot of fun to work with, as well. Overall it's a wonderful game with a lot of polish and plenty of content (and also loads and loads of DLC).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You no longer build your base up to attack, and no skirmish mode. You only control troops and complete objectives to increase your army's numbers. I feel like they took half the game away while making the graphics only a little better than before.			",27,0,0,3,2,0,17

												Really wished i hadn't WASTED my money on this thing.Ok, thats a bit harsh.Going from DOW 1 to DOW 2 is one hell of a change guys.If you want the same big scale war feel as the previous DOW games then this is probably not the game for you (unless you really *really* love strategy) - Sidenote: it seems to do strategy quite well, which is why they probably limit squad count to about... 4Sure, I didn't know what i was getting into when i bought this game but right off the bat, to me at least, micromanaging 4 small squads doesn't really scream a whole lot of 40k atmosphere to me. I'm not against micromanaging, but this game will really force it onto you whether you like it or not, and if you want to progress anywhere then you have to live with it.Again, the strategy side feels very finetuned and you can kinda tell they put a *lot* of thought into it when they were developing - but you really need to know your stuff if you're gonna beat peeps (i.e. what unit beats what, other races and their units, etc.). The game gives you a large amount of control for less units - each unit tends to have specific abilities or equipment that aid in fighting other specific units and unit types. Not bad, maybe a little overwhelming, i just simply lack the patience to play the game and learn from experience, it's almost physically and mentally painful for me to do so.Campaign drags a little but in general its fairly standard - a bit repetitve and puts a lot of focus on the individuals you control. Whether thats good or bad really depends on what kind of story you came for. It takes up a large portion of the content you pay for (unless it's a pack), but i can't say i care for it that much.personally?:Upgraded graphics -> downgraded gameplaybut you know, hey maybe thats just me			",53,6,0,6,7,0,7

												I have to say this is a very good strategy game. Though you don't build anything, you control mostly 4 squads which are very versatile and you slaughter your enemies in the glory of the Emperah. The squad system is really good. The campaign may be a little shorter if you don't do side-quests but with the expansion: DOW II - Chaos Rising, it makes the game longer and better with the corruption aspect and the multiple endings.The only bad thing is Games for Windows Live, it just sucks. Thankfully it has been removed in DOW II:Retribution. So buy it because it's an awesome game!kill the alien... burn the heretic... purge the unclean...In the name of the God Emperah!!!

I was expecting ""Oh this is a dream come true Dawn of war with high resolution models and textures and new races as well."" Well THQ took that dream and♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it put it into an oven and made a cake out if it. That cake is the vary game your considering on buying. To start with there’s 3 races to start then 1 or 2 more added per expansion and yet THERE IS NO ♥♥♥♥ING NECRONS! That and the new objective system to win is just completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I wanted to play capture point missions I would just go play TF2.Score:2/10 They got the look right but not the game play or features.

												I am sure there will be people who enjoy this, but I found it boring and repetitive.  It is a shame, I LOVED DOW 1 and was really excited at the possibility of DOW II until I actually got a look and played it.  They removed the amazing armies and RTS elements from DOW 1 and decided to go with some small scale band of brothers crap.  There is no real strategy unless you want to over think it.  You just get your heavies to brute force your way through, then run back when you get damage, heal, then go back in.  Rinse and repeat throught the game.  I just played through it for the story and have not touched it again, unlike DOW 1 which I occasionaly still play.			",430,173,3,150,71,1,104

No official word from Relic what so ever, not even a ""we know something is broken, we will fix it"".

												It would have been a much, much better game if the devs had either:a) used different mechanics that actually fit the franchise, orb) dropped the WH40k name on it.As it stands, anyone familiar with the tabletop will be disappointed, because the mechanics don't match the expectations. I've seen squads of 4 eldar guards having more than twice the hitpoints than 4 tactical marines. I've had WoW-style arena boss fights against orcs with 17k hitpoints and the ability to summon flamewaves and earthquakes.Seriously, I'll pass on this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved the original Dawn of War series, each expansion was great. So I was first in line for DoW II. I've been playing it a fair bit, had it before it was on Steam even (back in ye olde days of Windows Live) and no matter how much I really wish I could like it, I can't.It's boring as all Hell. It would probably be better with a friend to co-op with but honestly it's the exact same thing every mission and since you cannot build your own buildings or units there's zero variety. The story is good, the graphics are nice and that alone at least makes me want to try to get through the whole campaign and into the DLC campaigns, but it feels like such a chore because I cannot enjoy the gameplay. To add to the boring campaign missions, you must constantly return to each map you've already cleared to keep the 'threat levels' down; meaning you play the same map, the same way, several times over.The gameplay is meant to be reminiscent of Company of Heroes but it honestly falls well short of that bar. Company of Heroes was great and you had plenty to work with in terms of units and strategies. That is lacking completely here. Even the boss bottles boil down to watching for attack strikes and moving out of the way. Harder difficulties *are* hard and it just felt like I was punishing myself by playing something boring, dying and having to play it over again.I briefly attempted competitive multiplayer only to find I hadn't a clue, the game doesn't indicate what to do and the guys I was with went off in a angry frenzy, demanding that I should have gone and spent hours of YouTube research before I had the audacity to attempt online play. A game that requires study just to get the basics is no game.With DoW III coming soon, based on this miserable experience I shall definitely *not* be preordering and would only be tempted back into it if it looks more like the original series and nothing like this boring, boring, boring excuse for entertainment.

												If, like me, you loved the first Dawn of War, bare in mind that Dawn of War 2 is totally different.I played DoW to death back in the day. Building bases, and barracks, and armies until the early hours of every morning. And I was hoping DoW2 would be more of the same, so I was excited when I saw the collection on summer sale! ... but it's not.It's very linear and more about moving your squads around from cover to cover. No base building, just move and shoot, bit of story, move and shoot, bit of story.Some people might love the tactical side of it, but I personally think that's a bit dull, and not really my bag, so returned it.

Things that I really did enjoy: customising & levelling my squads & characters throughout the campaign - wouldve been cooler if the changes were as visibly obvious as D.O.W one though, the inclusion of using cover (although i still think work needs to be done on how the squads would clip to that cover), the combat animations were cool, and the new design / proportions for the space marines were cool too. Was also fun to finally be able to fight some Tyranids - after all, Tyranids were the first/second species of Warhammer 40k back in the Space Hulk days.			",11,2,0,0,0,0,4

This took everything I enjoyed of the first set, and removed it, leaving nothing but horrible, horrible garbage. Check points are stupid. Basing a ""strategy"" game around a check point and save spots is even worse. This is an excellent indicator in how sequels cannot live up to the original.			",48,5,1,19,3,0,13

												A completely different direction for the Dawn of War franchise has both good and bad points.This game looks great, and carries over a lot of the best parts of Company of Heroes, such as intuitive cover, powerful vehicles, and quick paced combat.The bad side is an over-reliance on heroes and special abilities. The game feels almost like an action RPG.			",44,6,0,3,3,3,16

												If you're looking for a more casual game in the franchise without base building RTS element, but more action, this game is for you. It's more of a bird's eye Action RTS and is very dynamic in its combat system. The story is also quite immersive and you get to meet 4 races in this game. However be warned: there are a ♥♥♥♥♥on of enemies. Like a♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne.			",62,17,1,8,5,0,13

												I am running the Linux version and I think there is some things to work on. I think this game got great potential and I played it a lot during its initial release on Windows. However I got to give this a thumbs down because it seems like it never got patched and there are a couple of things that I find broken.Issues:- Does not run out of the box on some Linux distros because of bad practise when defining LD_PRELOAD_ADDITIONS- The matchmaking in the game mode The Last Stand does not work. It will detect possible games but will not match you with them. This is one of the things I remember as broken since the initial release, the time to find a game in The Last Stand. However in Linux I could leave this on for 20 minutes without finding a game, even though the game presents for me that there are games available and people to match with (this is presented by the UI).Improvements:- Options to change default keybindings. I think this is a problem with the game in general. You cannot change fundamental keybindings like the map navigation, you are stuck with the arrow keys.- No key to reset the camera angle. This is another fundamental feature that you would expect out of a game like this. If you by mistake change the camera angle you are force to either play with that angle or try to manually find that original angle.			",46,6,0,2,6,0,9

												Something I forgot about this game. It doesn't respect your time management. Not being able to save mid-mission is a crippling deficiency for casual gamers. Be prepared to commit 50 minutes to playing a mission, for better or worse, even if you make a crucial error. Because it's never worth rage-quitting, and it's counter-productive to play without being prepared to sink at least 50 minutes into a single mission. Not even any bug-free mods to fix this, either. Can only manually back up save games. Easy mode is therefore the only enjoyable mode for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												they certainly did a change up after the previous games. This time instead of massive C&C like base invasions, now you are given a squad to attack with. This is more tactical and you can't just re-build people to make it less of a concern when your main character dies. Instead they fall incapacitated, but can be revived, though you have to get someone to get back their men for those in squads. I had a lot of fun with this and it felt closer to Warhammer 40K than the previous games and you could be tactical by taking up buildings or hiding behind cover for protection. Definantly worth a buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dawn of War 2 is a great game. (for simplicities sake I will include small references to the expansion Chaos rising here)If you played the original series and loved it, DoW2 is a bit of a departure from the old format but is none the less very enjoyable Overall - New mechanics, taken from Company of Heroes, such as a retreat functionMore defined rock/paper/scissorsNo more base building. In multiplayer you now have one Building from which everything is produced which you can level up through technologies advancesNew race - Tyranids (Space dinosaurs)-races available - Space Marines (super soldiers in space), Orks (they are Orks in space), Eldar (Elves in space) [chaos rising] Chaos Space Marines (Evil Super soldiers in space)Campagin - quick overviewThe campaign (in which you can only play space marines) is now a squadbased/rpg esque series of missions with different characters that you can level up/give different gear to and, in chaos rising, you can corrupt them, turning them to the ruinous powers. The campaign is fun. Missions are often 10-20 minute affairs with varying objectives. The units that you control are powerful and you will smile as 10 Space marines chew through a good 5 tyranids. The campaign is Co-op as well which is fun to play with a friend. Max level for you characters is 20 and chaos rising pushes it up to 30 and adds a couple characters.Multiplayer - quick overviewIn multiplayer, mostly you will be playing matchmaking (though im not sure how much of a community there is so you might be searching for quite a while but if you get it with friends it is still fun) with the sole objective being point control. Resources are gained through capturing requisition points much like in the original DoW. Power is now generated by holding power points and building power generators on it. The four races are all unique and fun each having their own strategies. You can level up all the different races with cosmetic details as you gain experience for games. Last stand - quick overviewLast stand is where you pick one character, which you can level up to level 20, from one of the 4(5) races (you have access to all of them no DLC unlike in retibution). Then you and 2 other people have to withstand 20 waves of enemies. A simple wave survival game mode but very fun when you get to higher waves and you have to fight 50 space marines with armour shredding plasma guns. An exceptionally fun game that i have spent far too long playing. The campaign is fun and quite long. The multiplayer is tactical and quick. Games generally don't take hours and combat can be quite intense. Last stand is a wave survival mode where you can laugh manically as you call in an orbital bombardment or fire massive balls of flame at hordes of poor gaunts.			",56,5,1,7,2,0,18

												I am a big fan of the first game, spent many hours with it almost 10 years ago... So when I saw the discount on the 2nd one I did not hesitate to buy it, but now I am really disappointed. The small changes in UI and gameplay just took away the spirit of the game. The new campaign model and the upgrade tree feels like it is a cheap MMO. So if you expect it to be like the first one I do not recommend it but if you are new to the universe it is a good game to play and this is a fairly good price for it (2,7 euros in Turkey).

												This game is a disgusting joke of a sequel. Dawn of War was an awesome game, and its expansions were really cool. 9 unique races to play? Amazing. There were some balance issues, but the game was really fun and offered so much choice.DoW2 took away so much of what DoW1 offered. It shouldn't be allowed to carry the name. It's radically different, and nowhere near as interesting. I was quite angry when I got DoW2 and realized it wasn't half the game DoW1 was.Now I get a 75% off coupon for this trash? You'd have to pay me to play this crap again. It's been years, and it still ticks me off enough that just being reminded of this travesty has motivated me to leave a review.			",121,13,6,8,12,1,17

												I still prefer the old Dawn of war games, I don't really like that it's less base building/base destruction, and more unit slaughter. Takes out the challenge of having to have enough Req/power to get upgrades, or get certain buildings. It also bothers me how the races are so limited now. Though I did enjoy the Tyranids, they were the only reason why I tried this game. I can't wait for Total war Warhammer 40k though, looks really fun.			",52,8,0,4,3,1,10

												They scaled the game way back, and now you operate with just 11 Space Marines, fighting off what seems like an invasion force from all the enemies of the Emperor! I don't know what the atmosphere was supposed to be for this game, but it should have taken place on ONE planet and involved the same number of Space Marines, instead we got a rather hilariously ABSTRACT invasion scenario where you hop from planet to planet using TEN Space Marines to fight off legions, again supposed legions... of enemies. I have already modded the game to try and SUPPORT what the story is telling me, because otherwise I feel they missed the ball with this one.Beautiful terrain work despite the camera being diffuclt to handle compared to the smoothness of DoW.

												I have always liked the Warhammer series of games, Dawn of war 2 is the exception. I wish they follwed dawn of wars' style. Instead they went with a very boring, controller 4 units game. sure it is great for micro practice but even then it still sucks because in any RTS game i ofter and almost always command more than 4 units. the combat system is ok, its a good reminder of what it used to be. As for story line. i think all warhammer fans think the same way. kill it! it focuses on the space marines, then a latter expansion gives you a choice of race. which is cool but should have been released with the vanilla version. Nothing really pops about this game. after you do 5 missions and meet the eldar you have experienced almost everything the game has to offer, to the point where it feels to much like grinding in an RPG and less like tactical warfare. id give the game a 3/10 and a 4/10 for the latter expansion. i bet if they made a dawn of war 3 and remade the first one they would have a great game, but this... i9 wouldn't give it to anyone. even if they paid me to take it. If you want to play it i will save you some money. go find a rough brick wall, then place your face against the wall and grind your face off till you hit bone. the surgery, pain killers and wasted time in the hospital would be more fun and in the long run would be a better experience than this			",97,6,3,19,3,1,21

												Going to try and make this short...  The game is beautiful, I love how they allowed more factions than in the base game, music is nice and still has some 40k authentic this&that, but sadly it's not feeling like the glove is a good fit this time around.  Was enough of a disappointment I it led to not being able to recommend this game. I was obviously disappointed.  I will try and make this short and give a few examples, but that's it. Dawn of War was great even though it lacked full customized matches (POP, Unit limitations, in-game map maker, etc...).  I love Space Marine; love painting it, reading it and even played some Tabletop, but too many things missing that should be added or not changed from the original.  A few examples are: Unit grouping (Ctrl+# = unit made and should stay within intelligent proximity = This Technology came out many years ago and easily adjusted) and no more unique buildings ....sucks!  Their attempts to lean into a MOBA are more than obvious to disadvantage.  A moba style will kill this game for me and all I know, so hopefully they do not go that route...hopefully.  They will be hiding under the wings of many successful MOBAs.I am a diehard 40k fan/gamer and I really wanted to give this game a great review, but I just can't.  Biggest disappointment for me was simply no buildings, but we are all different and that one was mine...Sirspoony rating: 5/10 ....more buildings and a couple other major changes = 8/10I will come back again and again to check up on this game and really hope a few more patches and things will feel right once again or maybe even better, but with their obvious direction I think maybe after their MOBA fails...ugh :)UPDATED REVIEW:After some dicussion and more exploration in suggested DLC and strategy talks, my review has changed slightly.  I can now recommend this game.  When playing in a team based environment the game can be tons of fun over TS, but without that and trying to PUG, it's still lacking; given how small the community is, among other reasons.  In the end though I granted the game a better rating, but deep down inside I really wanted to find a way to give a recommendation.NEW Sirspoony Rating:  6.25/10			",148,13,5,25,8,0,24

In multiplayer you now have one Building from which everything is produced which you can level up through technologies advancesNew race - Tyranids (Space dinosaurs)-races available - Space Marines (super soldiers in space), Orks (they are Orks in space), Eldar (Elves in space) [chaos rising] Chaos Space Marines (Evil Super soldiers in space)Campagin - quick overviewThe campaign (in which you can only play space marines) is now a squadbased/rpg esque series of missions with different characters that you can level up/give different gear to and, in chaos rising, you can corrupt them, turning them to the ruinous powers. The campaign is fun. Missions are often 10-20 minute affairs with varying objectives. The units that you control are powerful and you will smile as 10 Space marines chew through a good 5 tyranids. The campaign is Co-op as well which is fun to play with a friend. Max level for you characters is 20 and chaos rising pushes it up to 30 and adds a couple characters.Multiplayer - quick overviewIn multiplayer, mostly you will be playing matchmaking (though im not sure how much of a community there is so you might be searching for quite a while but if you get it with friends it is still fun) with the sole objective being point control. Resources are gained through capturing requisition points much like in the original DoW. Power is now generated by holding power points and building power generators on it. The four races are all unique and fun each having their own strategies. You can level up all the different races with cosmetic details as you gain experience for games. Last stand - quick overviewLast stand is where you pick one character, which you can level up to level 20, from one of the 4(5) races (you have access to all of them no DLC unlike in retibution). Then you and 2 other people have to withstand 20 waves of enemies. A simple wave survival game mode but very fun when you get to higher waves and you have to fight 50 space marines with armour shredding plasma guns. An exceptionally fun game that i have spent far too long playing. The campaign is fun and quite long. The multiplayer is tactical and quick. Games generally don't take hours and combat can be quite intense. Last stand is a wave survival mode where you can laugh manically as you call in an orbital bombardment or fire massive balls of flame at hordes of poor gaunts.			",56,5,1,7,2,0,18

												they certainly did a change up after the previous games. This time instead of massive C&C like base invasions, now you are given a squad to attack with. This is more tactical and you can't just re-build people to make it less of a concern when your main character dies. Instead they fall incapacitated, but can be revived, though you have to get someone to get back their men for those in squads. I had a lot of fun with this and it felt closer to Warhammer 40K than the previous games and you could be tactical by taking up buildings or hiding behind cover for protection. Definantly worth a buy.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												I am a big fan of the first game, spent many hours with it almost 10 years ago... So when I saw the discount on the 2nd one I did not hesitate to buy it, but now I am really disappointed. The small changes in UI and gameplay just took away the spirit of the game. The new campaign model and the upgrade tree feels like it is a cheap MMO. So if you expect it to be like the first one I do not recommend it but if you are new to the universe it is a good game to play and this is a fairly good price for it (2,7 euros in Turkey).

												Going to try and make this short...  The game is beautiful, I love how they allowed more factions than in the base game, music is nice and still has some 40k authentic this&that, but sadly it's not feeling like the glove is a good fit this time around.  Was enough of a disappointment I it led to not being able to recommend this game. I was obviously disappointed.  I will try and make this short and give a few examples, but that's it. Dawn of War was great even though it lacked full customized matches (POP, Unit limitations, in-game map maker, etc...).  I love Space Marine; love painting it, reading it and even played some Tabletop, but too many things missing that should be added or not changed from the original.  A few examples are: Unit grouping (Ctrl+# = unit made and should stay within intelligent proximity = This Technology came out many years ago and easily adjusted) and no more unique buildings ....sucks!  Their attempts to lean into a MOBA are more than obvious to disadvantage.  A moba style will kill this game for me and all I know, so hopefully they do not go that route...hopefully.  They will be hiding under the wings of many successful MOBAs.I am a diehard 40k fan/gamer and I really wanted to give this game a great review, but I just can't.  Biggest disappointment for me was simply no buildings, but we are all different and that one was mine...Sirspoony rating: 5/10 ....more buildings and a couple other major changes = 8/10I will come back again and again to check up on this game and really hope a few more patches and things will feel right once again or maybe even better, but with their obvious direction I think maybe after their MOBA fails...ugh :)UPDATED REVIEW:After some dicussion and more exploration in suggested DLC and strategy talks, my review has changed slightly.  I can now recommend this game.  When playing in a team based environment the game can be tons of fun over TS, but without that and trying to PUG, it's still lacking; given how small the community is, among other reasons.  In the end though I granted the game a better rating, but deep down inside I really wanted to find a way to give a recommendation.NEW Sirspoony Rating:  6.25/10			",148,13,5,25,8,0,24

												This is made for people who don't like using their brains, the first Dawn of War; and particularly Dark Crusade were gems of RTS gaming. This is ok for one play thru, but replayability is nil. Oh and I owned the original DoW+expansions on D2D and Soulstorm on DVD back in the day, so that's why it isn't in my library. I put hundreds of hours into DOW 1+expansions, played through DoW 2 and Chaos Rising campaigns once each, loaded the first mission for Retribution and exited within 10 seconds, it's just too boring. For those who like some actual strategy in your RTS games (looking at you 90s gamers), you will not find much depth here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed the campaign, but at the same time was dismayed it was another chapter in the Blood Raven's saga, which is I guess a staypoint of the DoW franchise.Frankly, Relic could make plenty of money off me by offering:A: Another expansion to DoW 1 with a whole new tyranid campaign and tyranid raceB: A whole new campaign for DoW 2 with a Tau update, and EITHER a Tau or Tyranid campaign.Instead we're getting DoW 3 with... better graphics and larger walkers.I really don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about how big or how flashy the graphics are, I want fun stories and amazing campaigns. That being said, this is EXACTLY what Dow II offered, but only for the boring ol' human race.Sincerely, a Tyranid and Tau fan.			",3,0,0,3,1,0,4

												One of the few strategy games WHERE THE CAMPAIGN IS COOP MY GODS THIS GAME IS AWESOME. Grab a friend and play one of the more complex games. Part of the franchise that has been here for awhile and would take over Starcraft anyday. For anyone looking for troop/squad based combat such as company of heroes or men of war. Warhammer dawn of war II takes away the city building aspect of the first game (though some might dislike it specifically for this change) and places down a more tactical based game. Play it!

												I grew up with the original Dawn of War games and i have to say whilst i greatly miss the heavier RTS/building aspects of those games, this game does hold it's own in a different way. DoW 2 sticks to the lore of the franchise quite well and i enjoyed the squad based gameplay. All in all it was a fun game, multiplayer can be a hit hit and miss (sometimes quite dead) but for the single player aspect it's a game i would recommend playing.			",183,26,4,25,28,1,25

												I wasn't very impressed with this sequel. It felt more like a knee-jerk reaction to competition to Star Craft II than expanding on the previous game. There wasn't much ""strategy"" involved and it 90% of the time ended up as a really long stalemate game until someone got relaxed enough that they made a mistake. The lack of units and unit abilities like in the previous game made it very boring as well. I liked some of the ""newer"" units, such as heroes, but it just didn't hit the void in my heart from the first game. Being that it's a couple years later that I'm reviewing this, I can imagine that this game is no longer supported, so I doubt there will be any additions or expansions outside of what is already released for this game.Oh, and GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE. Why on EARTH would you include this in a game that you would sell on Steam?

												Really solid tactical squad based rts with limited base building and more of am emphasis on persistent squads. The world of Warhammer 40k is shown perfectly. The game even supports co-op campaign, and online pvp/hoard modes with multiple races. (campaign can only be played as space marines) However multiplayer is pretty much dead. For a 2009 game it looks nice (same engine as Company of Heroes), but is obviously a little outdated by todays standards.Despite all this though I have to say just get DoW2: Retribution instead. This and Chaos Rising both use Games for Windows Live, an always online drm that will be shut down by July of 2014. The game is not playable offline at all. The Retribution stand alone expansion instead uses Steamworks and supports offline play** NVM, Glorious news my battle brothers! Relic has confirmed as of June 16, 2014 that they will move the servers from GFWL to Steamworks and improve the matchmaking system.

												The game is great! It's got everything an RTS should have (to me anyway) and it is great fun, there's one thing I find dissapointing about it, that is, where did the ability to build your base go? That was the best feature of DoW 1, being able to build it from just a command centre, necron monolith ect. I really miss that. I'd say that DoW 3 should really allow you to do this again, and we need all the species in the game, it just doesnt work, either we have all the species in the game or just set a few like the necron, tau, and dark eldar as dlc (though I'd not prefer it). Still this game is a great one at that, there's just a few things that makes me think the original was a bit better than this, either way, it's fun and enjoyable, so I do recommend you to get this game!

												Great strategy game. The universe is awesome (one of my all time favorites), and the combination of RTS/RPG mechanics is just right. Plus, no annoying base building garbage to get in the way of the fun (and sometimes quite graphic) combat.

												Excellent Co-op game, not so great to play soloControl a small group of Space Marines exterminating hordes of aliens in real time tactical combat. If starcraft, diablo and xcom had a three way, the result would be something like this.The story is not deep, but it is pretty well written, and the voice acting is mostly well done.In single player it can be hard to control all of your squads effectively given the fast pace of the game, but in co-op you divide the squads between the two players, which makes it much easier to get the most out of them.  Playing this game with a friend is a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wasn't very impressed with this sequel. It felt more like a knee-jerk reaction to competition to Star Craft II than expanding on the previous game. There wasn't much ""strategy"" involved and it 90% of the time ended up as a really long stalemate game until someone got relaxed enough that they made a mistake. The lack of units and unit abilities like in the previous game made it very boring as well. I liked some of the ""newer"" units, such as heroes, but it just didn't hit the void in my heart from the first game. Being that it's a couple years later that I'm reviewing this, I can imagine that this game is no longer supported, so I doubt there will be any additions or expansions outside of what is already released for this game.Oh, and GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE.

												Really solid tactical squad based rts with limited base building and more of am emphasis on persistent squads. The world of Warhammer 40k is shown perfectly. The game even supports co-op campaign, and online pvp/hoard modes with multiple races. (campaign can only be played as space marines) However multiplayer is pretty much dead. For a 2009 game it looks nice (same engine as Company of Heroes), but is obviously a little outdated by todays standards.Despite all this though I have to say just get DoW2: Retribution instead. This and Chaos Rising both use Games for Windows Live, an always online drm that will be shut down by July of 2014. The game is not playable offline at all. The Retribution stand alone expansion instead uses Steamworks and supports offline play** NVM, Glorious news my battle brothers! Relic has confirmed as of June 16, 2014 that they will move the servers from GFWL to Steamworks and improve the matchmaking system.

												Coming from the original Dawn of War the new sequel builds on what made the original so immersive and engaging to play. All of what you'd expect from the warhammer universe is recreated in stunning art form and the voice acting has always been exceptional and this installment is no different. Do keep in mind though that if you are looking for the same classic sync-kill animations then this version of DOW doesn't quite have it; it has sync-kill animations, but not on the same level of detail and elaborate smoothness as the original did, which does pull me away from the immersion somewhat. Nonetheless strategy wise this is more of a micro-management RTS versus DOW 1's classic base building, with more focus on detail and unit to unit synergies. The campaign is pretty good too. As of right now, buy this when it's on sale, or wait for DOW III and get them together in a bundle.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not too big on squad based RTSs, though this one was so fun that I couldn't put it down.  Each mission takes about ten to fifteen minutes, give or take, so you’ll be putting a lot of time into this game in order to complete the campaign.  There will also be numerous boss fights of varying difficulties to contend with.  There are two points of interest / buildings on each map that you can capture to increase your squads’ abilities, though you’ll only be able to capture one of them in a sitting.  Don’t worry, you’ll often come back to these maps (optional or not) in which case you can capture the other one you missed.  Capturing them goes a long way into making your team that much more formidable. There’s a lot more that I didn’t cover…squad types, gear slots, factions, special items, and etc.  I will say however that the game is seriously worth the money, especially now that it’s come down in price since launch.  My only complaint is the lack of variety in gear, though “Chaos Rising” offers a bit more in that department.  This is one squad management / strategy game that you won’t want to miss.---Full Review:http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/---

Warhammer dawn of war II takes away the city building aspect of the first game (though some might dislike it specifically for this change) and places down a more tactical based game. Play it!

												Unlike other similar RTS games, this game focuses on squadron tactics combat. You don’t need to build any buildings and gather any resources in order to produce and upgrade units. By this way, you can concentrate your mind on the real-time strategic combat completely and enjoy the intense combat process. I also appreciate the RPG elements in this game.

												Despite the fact that THQ abandoned the original DoW2 in favor of the DLC-ridden Retribution, I still enjoy this game, and it's far superior to the first DoW. Smaller squads make for more streamlined combat, and the addition of perks and level-ups makes you want to keep your heroes alive for the next battle. And you can finally play the most vicious race in the W40K universe: the Tyranids.It's too bad players jumped ship to Retribution when it came out- it's extremely difficult to find a public DoW2 match these days, but that's not surprising considering it uses Games for Windows as a matchmaking service. Why THQ couldn't just have dropped GfWL completely from DoW2 instead of building another version is beyond me (actually, it's all about nickel-and-diming the fanbase now, so I guess it's really no surprise).DoW2 is officially my last THQ product for reasons I won't get into, but I'm glad it was this instead of one of their crappier games :).

												I've played a couple of hours and finished the game. The plot was good and i highly recommend it if you like a dynamic and strategic and tactical games. I think that this is definitley one of my most favourite game series out there so far and hopefully they release more of warhammer becuase i'm just waiting here till the new one comes out. I would rate it 8/10, the reason why it didn't get 10/10 becuase although the plot is good the story is a bit short and is quite easy to complete. Because it only took me a couple of hours to complete which really isn't that long becuase most games with storylines take quite sometime e.g. borderlands and others. This game truely is a wonder but still requires a bit more like most games, you can't just leave it there because there's always more too add. ",32,5,0,5,2,0,7

												I have only one bad point to describe in the game. Please don't say: choose if never played rts in :recruit difficulty. I had to restart campain since I thought it was to easy even though i just randomly klicked. I now started in normal difficulty: seargant. Wich should be the one evryone should use. I felt like Nah i dont wona achieve al those achievements on such easy difficult :p . So that's why. Now for the game! -> read first if saving up for difficulty noncense Realy a fun and dynamic game even in 2016. It's more like a team based rpg fighting hordes of enemies taking cover using skills , items like nades.. etc . And u even have a nice squad that can bomb buildings while being invissible. The interactions are sweet. U can see the enemy trying to shoot u when u trow the detonation bomb to the building. Although you are invissible so they can't hit you ^^ I ended my gameplay for today againt a bossbattle. after boss missions you receive rankings on total enemies killed time and squads alive! Downside? Well you cannot replay the missions you did :( -> be aware I only played 3 hours , but it's on one day .  I feel complete after playing this ! Highly recommended .

												You can't save your game and resume later in the middle of a mission.  You have to start over from the beginning of the mission if you have to stop playing.I played and loved the ""Retribution"" expansion, but games that are difficult to pickup and put down easily just aren't in my time budget.  It's sad, because I do like the small squad RTS style very, very much, but no saves during missions is a deal-breaker.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was skeptical when this game announced that it would only be Gears of War style combat and no strategy. The sequel to the RTS Dawn of War has been turned into an arena combat game along the lines of a MOBA. There is no resource management, no bases to construct, and no squads which are the bedrock of the table-top game on which this series is based.Admittedly, the single-player campaign has a pretty good story line, as far as game storylines go, and the art design of the Warhammer 40K universe is always great.Bottom line, if you're looking for a real-time strategy base-building game, this is not that game. If you're okay with losing those aspects, or are a real fan of the source material, then give it a try if it's under $7 USD.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very good game in terms of squad based RTS- You don't have to build a whole base.- Your squads level up and get better gear / guns- You either attack or defense targets / buildings- Co-op mode is def fun!9/10			",242,15,30,28,29,1,28

												Dawn of War 2 is a squad based tactical real time strategy game in which you command a small platoon of space marines, of which only about 6 of them have names and plot armor.In command of your squads you haveSilent Anime Protagonist (You)Arnold Schartzneger Big Gun McHatesImperialGuardForNoreason (he has about the IQ of a rock)Emo Edge Sniper the Hedgehog (his scout squad is absolute garbage, so no one uses him)Naive Newbie Kid made of glass commanding glass squad with health that scales really poorly even though he and his assault marines wear the same kind of armor as tac marinesBadass super captain who murdered 7 entire armies on Kronus but turns into a vegetable in a coffin because lazy writing (but he is also pretty trash and you don't get him until late, so don't even bother)and finally, Tarkus, the old bald guy and essentially the only actually alright character in the game who seems somewhat reasonable and space marine-y.Together you will fight against a not-so-unstopable tyranid threat and sometimes orks as well as some eldar who fight you also because they are socially awkward neets who are incapable of just saying ""yo, nids r coming fam, if we help one another we can totes beat them"" while you will essentially be reinforcing your squads with more space marines than the Blood Raven chapter physically has available.Directing your actions is Captain Gabriel ""Grave News"" Angelos who chimes in every now and then to tell you about grave news and him being months away from arriving to help you (when you actually beat the game in about a week's ingame time if you've played any basic RTS prior).No spoilers, but considering that you play as some space marines with plot armor it's pretty self explanatory that the good guys win in the end, I know, I was really surprised.All in all it's actually not a bad game, it has a few pretty old mods that change the campaign and MP a bit if you get bored of vanilla balancing, so it's entirely possible to have larger squads and big skirmishes and stuff if you missed those from the DOW1 series.

												Unlike the first Dawn of War, DoW II's first four hours focus solely on RTS gameplay - not base-building emphasis, which I thought would be kind of nice. But 3-4 hours in, the gameplay is SO STALE. I have mostly had the same 4-5 units at my command the whole time, they aren't getting skills fast enough to keep gameplay fresh, and the tactics I'm using against the enemy are pretty much the same, regardless of which map I'm playing. The story was potentially interesting, but again, 3-4 hours in - I've stopped caring at this point. Bounce me back and forth across the universe a couple more times to do the same thing for like the tenth time.So sad that this game exists in such an otherwise incredibly lore rich setting. The Codex Astartes must classify this game as heretical material.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I picked this up for a mere £6 in a Steam sale and BOY am I glad I did!  A very refreshing slant on the slightly dated previous Dawn of War mechanic.  In Dawn of War II the emphasis is on objectives, as ever, but your only tactical choices are made once at the beginning of the mission.  Well worth re-installing if you already have it and WELL worth the few pounds it is currently on Steam!			",194,18,2,26,10,0,36

												This is the successor of the well aclaimed Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War franchise. If you're not a fan of the Warhammer universe or if you have not played the Dawn of War (1) series, then I do not recommend this game. The difference between this game and its predecessor is astounding. This game is consisted of a very strange mix of genres. It's a strategic RPG with more action elements than strategy. The game lacks depth, and this mix of genres might not suit all players. The graphics are improved over Dawn of War (1), and the story is fantastic, however, the gameplay is not that great. Overall opinion: good, but not great, 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played a couple of hours and finished the game. The plot was good and i highly recommend it if you like a dynamic and strategic and tactical games. I think that this is definitley one of my most favourite game series out there so far and hopefully they release more of warhammer becuase i'm just waiting here till the new one comes out. I would rate it 8/10, the reason why it didn't get 10/10 becuase although the plot is good the story is a bit short and is quite easy to complete. Because it only took me a couple of hours to complete which really isn't that long becuase most games with storylines take quite sometime e.g. borderlands and others. This game truely is a wonder but still requires a bit more like most games, you can't just leave it there because there's always more too add. ",32,5,0,5,2,0,7

												You can't save your game and resume later in the middle of a mission.  You have to start over from the beginning of the mission if you have to stop playing.I played and loved the ""Retribution"" expansion, but games that are difficult to pickup and put down easily just aren't in my time budget.  It's sad, because I do like the small squad RTS style very, very much, but no saves during missions is a deal-breaker.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I honestly enjoy this game. I've heard it compared several times to a mix between RPG and MOBA and while those compariosons in the single player game are not untrue, this doesnt take away from the game. While recent issues with GFWL closing down and making the game not work for some people, relic has been working hard to fix those and for most should be able to play it. While certainly not the strategy title that puts all others to shame, what this game does deliver is:Very good graphics for an RTS gameLots of warhammer 40K goodnessA combat system that breaks the chain of resource gathering for that of squad based workCustomization of squads that lets you tailor them to your game play style while still letting them have their own very specific roles. If I had to be frank I would recomend this game to those who are trying to get into strategy games, those who like MOBAs, and anyone whos a big fan of warhammer 40K and doenst mine tromping around as the Blood Ravens. While the GFWL shut down has been a massive disiaster across teh gaming industry I'd say this game has mostly gotten out of those issues and can say that the price I spent on it was worth it. That being said if you are looking for more tradtional base building and game play closer to C&C, then give the original Dawn Of War a try. That being said, I do have a bone to pick with Relic. Guy's, if you are reading this, want to make this the RTS game that defines the Genre and destroys the competion, then you have to adress the major elephant in the room. Yeah, we both know what I'm talking about. No Space Wolf single player. And I'm not saying this as a Space Wolf fan boy. I'm saying this as a Space Wolf fanatic. Toss them in, Space vikings punching Orks. Will sell like hot cakes. We can do this guys! Make it happen!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not like Warhammer® 40,000™: Dawn of War®. If you liked that game, play that game. Don't ruin your memory of it. It's not as good.Not that DoWII is necessarily overtly bad, it should just have had its own title because it's nothing like DoWI at all.I like the multiple commander wargear, and some of the abilities are quite cool. I just want to build bases and play strategy, which this game doesn't really do.			",22,1,0,12,2,1,10

												Ok, I bought this game FULLY expecting to build bases which is BY FAR THE BEST PART of this series. About 8 missions in I noticed that I had already had almost little to no fun, just waiting for the base building to start. Good thing I purchased the GRANDMASTER EDITION so I can be that much more dissapointed in the fact that this game is attrocious and the creators took out the best part. What the hell was I thinking?			",58,5,0,7,11,0,8

												This game takes a step away from the base creation style rts and towards a more tactical squad based one. For some people this may be a step in the wrong direction especially if you were expecting something similar to dow. I personally think it is a refreshing and interesting new way to play, and gives a new edge to the series. I will not argue that the feeling of building an army until it covers the landscape is an incredible experience, the new tactical strategy introduced by Dow 2 does not dissapoint as you truly feel the uniqueness of your squads.

												This is a solid game, and so far a lot of fun. The people complaining and giving negative reviews are just whining that this game is very different from the first. (which is true) But you have to look at this as less of a sequel and more of an entirely unique game.This game is drastically different from DOW1, but I really like it a lot more. These campaigns and battles feel more real than in the original. Instead of building a whole new base every game (Which gets old) you just supervise the troop deployments, and command the forces you are given. Your troops are deployed from the battleships in orbit of the systems you fight on. You also get to customize your squads before battles and tinker with all thier equipment and abilities. By far my favourite thing about this game is leveling up all my squads and outfitting them before missions. It gives the squads personality, and offers unique approaches during skirmishes.All in all, ignore the whiners, they just wanted a clone of the first game with better graphics. I still play the first game now and then cause it's fun, but this is a very fresh experience too, and a load of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS IS FOR THE WHOLE DOW 2 SERIES NOT JUST THIS GAME!!!In comparison to the Dow 1 games with LARGE scale battles and Every race (exept tyranids) *AHEM* Dow 2 has (in MY view) let its ancestors down Which has saddend me because there was alot of potential with the newer graphics tech and people. This series has really made me lose trust in everything sega touches (grubby fingersiss) and has made me decide if i want a real large scale battle ill stay to the origionals.			",64,6,0,13,10,0,14

Like honestly don't read this♥♥♥♥♥♥if you don't want to, this is my♥♥♥♥♥♥ Go away if you don't like it. I don't care. No, get out!Anyways, you know it's Aylix here and today we're gonna' be looking at Warhammer® 40,000™: Dawn of War® II. Yeah I did it, that's the full ♥♥♥♥ing title. First off I'll just come right out and say it, this game is amazing. Like, you can do so much in it. And then again you can't. It's the perfect balance of limitation and freedom. I love the new formula they went for with it, it's much different from the first Dawn Of War! There's more of a tactical type of feel to it. You control a select group instead of a whole army and there's no real farming for resources or whatever you want to call it. This formula allows you to put your Commander (The guy who basically leads your little group of space marines) in cover as well as the rest of his subordinates. There is 'Good' cover and 'Bad' cover. This is indicated by dots under your character sprites. When green that means you're characters will take less or no damage at all. When yellow you're more at risk for enemy fire. There are different types of space marines you'll have command over. Each with thier own different roles. Not to spoil anything though. Well I mean it's been out for like a decade who cares. There's a group of Heavy Bolters (Heavy machine gunners) who will suppress the enemy. They take time to set up and all that. You have the commander who has leadership buffs with abilites that will help his troops. A stealth group with snipers who can sneak up on their enemies with cloak. There's the regular space marines who make up the bronze of your group. And a group of jump pack space marines who fly and and honestly just destroy everything.There are leaders for each of these small groups and you can kit them out with different weapons, buffs, abilites and armor. It's really cool and interesting. The enemies are really smart with their A.I and usually will employ tactics instead of just swarming you. You have to micro-manage all of your squads in order to get the most done in the quickest amount of time. Failing to do this will cause some of your squads to take un-needed damage. They're all a oiled team and keeping them working properly is a must.The gameplay is fluid and there are all types of enemies you can fight, different races and all of that. They are unique in their own way and use different weapons that will cause you to switch up your ways of combating other opponents. This game was really cool when it first came out and it's still very entertaining now. The multiplayer is kind of dead but it's basically, control one character and fight waves of Orks/Tyranid/Eldar. That's it. You'll probably die a lot too because most of the time you'll be playing with randoms. have fun with that! The game is rather long though, the campaign is, and it can get a little repetitive but overall if you just enjoy Warhammer and the game it's self you'll hardly notice.			",66,3,1,6,0,0,2

												Let me just say, the game is fun....if you have someone to play with. If not then I hope you like strategy where you control multiple squads at the same time, moving them around in a strategic pattern, and using multiple skills and equiptment per squad. If you are not a multi-tasker, this is not for you, unless you have a friend to help you through it.			",17,0,2,5,1,0,7

												Imagine the Dawn of War series, the awesome RTS game that introduced the concept of having squads instead of individual units. Now take out the RTS part of the game. That's what this is. There's little emphasis on resource gathering and an extreme emphasis on ""leveling' up your units.Every race is basically copy-pasted from the last race, with a few values barely tweaked. The storyline is boring and forgettable. The campaign is a full-on RPG with literally no RTS elements. While the skirmishes have more of those elements, I'd hardly call it an RTS. Yes, you build units ocassionally, and gather some reasources, but there's no way to construct buildings on or around the resource collecting points so you just end up constantly shuffling around your army to counteract the enemy capturing your points. Most of the units can't be upgraded through buildings with passive stat increases or ability augments, you have to level them up individually.The only redeemable thing about this game and it's ""expansions"" (which only add extra races) is the campaign. It's different for every race (in the beginning at least) and is a marginally fun RPG adventure in which you level up your heros through-out levels and gear them up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Given my die-hard love of the original Warhammer seriers, this was a kick in the balls. There are very few games of this stature that I regret buying, but this is at the top of the list. Lots of people love this game and god love 'em, but this is a change of genre that really can kill a series. I prefer the prior format, and the squad-based action doesn't appeal to me. This is the penalty I pay for not reading reviews prior to purchase. Had I know what I was getting, I never would have purchased the game. I found Command and Conquer 4 to be equally disappointing as it changed the fundamental mechanics of the game, as well. Again, shame on me for not reading the reviews. I'm happy for those who love this game, but for someone who's used to the ""way things were"" this really disappoints.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahhhh Dawn of war. Brilliant game.What's in store for the sequel! A completely different style RTS that removes the simple army management/base building of the first game and replaces it with unit cool-down management. Imagine a single player Dota. That sounds awful doesn't it. It is. Just like Dota you also get to manage your items and stats! but not in game, you do it after each mission. Give item x to unit x. Level up tank stats on the tank character and damage stats on the damage character.Be careful if you're here because you loved the first game. This is a different kettle of fish.

												This game abandons traditional RTS features such as resource management and base building (the two things I hate about RTS) and replaces them with RPG features (leveling and character customization, the two things I like about RPG).You lead a small team of about 6 heroes, and are only able to bring up to 4 into battle. You tend to be vastly outnumbered, but good use of your abilities will give you the upper hand.Co-op is where this game shines. You can give control of 1-3 of your heroes to your friend while you focus on your own. And then there's Last Stand, which I gave its own review. Last Stand in Retribution has more units and wargear, but it's still just as fun in Dawn of War II.			",379,90,4,45,15,1,28

												1: Vanilla gameShort: If you just want to see space marines story - play easy or normal. If you want tactics game - check infested planet game, as this one doesn`t have any tactics.""Cheat wherever you can. A.I.s are handicapped. They need to cheat from time to time if they're going to close the gap... Never get caught cheating. Nothing ruins the illusion of a good A.I. like seeing how they're cheating.""— Jonny Ebert, lead designer of Dawn of War 2 on video game A.I.As a game this thing is just a waste of time. It is not a good tactics nor a space marines game. At least for hard difficulty. The game design is just outright heresy & the code is full of bugs. Storywise is ok (though boring). Main campaign missions don`t really pose much challenge (except for boredom) while defence missions are just impossible - i couldn`t beat any of them except for the first one, and they only become harder with squads level. Must be due to a designer have ♥♥♥♥ed up with balancing of enemy lvl to player lvl (btw leveling enemy with player is the filthiest game design mechanic). The gameplay (captain difficulty) mostly consists of ""hit and run"" or covert tactics, which is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for a space marines game. The working tactics is - put Cyrus in infiltrate mode somewhere in flanks take Tarkus, put him in superarmour advancement mode, taunt enemies, gallop Avitus somewhere there, when imbecile AI groups together, rocket jump Cap into there. In 10 secs some squad would be instakilled, take all survivors, tap X to run back to base like ♥♥♥♥♥es (this is a space marines game, mind you), get Cyrus to raise someone in stealth mode, restore men, get back, until this group of enemies is dead. repeat. repeat. repeat for 30 hours.After acquiring the terminator armor the difficulty suddenly dropped from hardcore to rather easy.. 2: Chaos RisingWell, they made much improvements here, changing the game from bad to mediocre. My captain difficulty game was imported as primarch (or at least I got the primarch achievment after I finished it - either way that`s a bug, one of hundreds). The action is a little more dynamic, the game is a little more fun, still boring though. It is a little hard in the beginning right till the moment when I could use my 3 terminator armor sets from vanilla game, after which the game became a cakewalk. The thing that I don`t understand the most in the game design - why my units have 200-500 hp (dreadnought - around 1000), while single chaos space marine has 25000 and more? The final boss had 2.5 millions. This just makes battles tedious, not interesting.I think the best advice would be to play this game on sergeant, just to see the story, tactics-wise the game is nothing, as i said before.

												I didn't enjoy this at all. There's a complete lack of strategy and the combat feels stale. The upgrades are nice but it doesn't diminish the monotonic nature of each mission.All you have to do is drag your party from one band of enemies to another. You're not encouraged to stop and plan your moves as you're rewarded on how fast you complete the mission.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sigh. This didn't age well. I ground through as much as I could, but it just can't compare to Starcraft. I really wanted to like this due to the 40K fictional universe, but as a game goes, it's just a bit thudding and dull. I like both Starcraft and Civ, but I just can't recommend this 40K game in good conscience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This WAS a great game and enjoyable to play. Unfortunately, it no longer works for me.The original company, Relic, was bought by SEGA. SEGA does have some forum posts that suggest help, but there is no funding for a patch. I have tried every fix suggested to no avail. There are others that have the same problem.It may or may not have to do something to do with Games for Windows Live being phased out.I kills me that I am NOT recommending this game. If you buy it and luck out, you will enjoy the gameplay.			",62,7,0,13,5,0,12

												I'm surprised that this game has mostly positive reviews. I installed the game a few months back just started playing it, and as soon as I got to my third or fourth mission, it would no longer work the screen would go black. I hit the cache button and it got all of the data with no corruption and tried again. went to the third or fourth level and black screen again. I am not the only customer who had this issue. I tried everything to lowering the graphics a little to re-caching it to uninstalling and reinstalling it and Compatibility mode. With everything I did I'm still getting the same problem. So I guess I'll never be able to finish the story to play into Dawn Of War III, I'll just have to just skip into the third game. Thank god I got this game for free from Tremor  games.com  Also I don't know wether or not to recommend this game so I'll let you guys decide yourself.

												A good game no doubt, but a sequel to Dawn of War not so muchIf you want an explanation then sit tight. What Relic has done is mashed the good of Company of Heroes with the skin of Warhammer 40,000. For me personally the mechanics of Company of Heroes only suits a World War II theme, for Warhammer 40K, I think its better to remain what Space Marines was or what the previous Dawn of War games were (An actual RTS) Gone is the building, Gone is the large over powered armies, Gone are the Necrons (my favourite faction)So the game does a good campaign, the Company of Heroes mechanics seem to work well with the campaign but for skirmish, not so good in my opinion. Get if you want, but think of it as Company of Heroes 40K			",10,0,0,1,2,0,6

												An amazing addition to the Warhammer franchise.Even if you don't know anything about the Warhammer universe you can still enjoy this title with ease. In fact, the original Dawn of War game (the version before this one) is what got me into the Warhammer universe.With good looking graphics, solid RTS gameplay, a story that melds with Warhammer story and extra features not usually found in other RTS games, Dawn of War II is an amazing RTS for both single player and multi-player modes.Runs flawlessly on just about any modern PC you should defianetly pick-up this game if you like real time strategy titles.I would give this game a solid 9/10.

												I really liked the Warhammer dawn of war 1st one. But unfortunately I can’t say the same about the 2nd one. First off all the game misses RTS side and got a lot of RPG. I think the game could be good if there would be a good balance between RTS and RPG. But it’s not this time.Second the whole game seems really cheap, if you would look in the story line and champing.

												Relic removed tactical pause from the game after 5 or 6 years after release. Its presence was a major point why I bought this game, and after 7 years I'm sure I couldn't get a refund, so I just removed this piece of now useless s... oftware from my game list.But about the game (not taking into account the thing above):If you liked the first Dawn of War you will like this one too, although the game mechanics changed significantly. It's still an RTS, but you'll have way less units to command at the same time. You may think that's a step backwards, but in fact the game got some RPG aspects: there's loot to be found/earn and equip on your units, and as they fight they get experience points which can be invested into abilities. Nicely done; not too simple, but at the same time you don't have to be an RPG addict to enjoy this aspect.All in all, it is recommended by all means. That's why I got furious about Relic's super♥♥♥♥♥♥move. Way to go Relic, count me out from purchasing any of your future games.			",234,57,3,44,63,1,55

												THIS IS NOT THE SAME KIND OF RTS LIKE THE ORIGINAL DOW. In DOW1, you would construct buildings, plan our your base and defenses, produce units to meet certain types of resistance, and work to destroy the enemy's base and take over the map. DOW2? Nope. It's a squad-based top-down shooter. I liked the original DOW because I'm a fan of Starcraft and I liked this unique take on traditional RTS games, so when I bought DOW2 thinking they just improved on the original formula, I was extremely disappointed to find that they didn't improve the original forumla, they scraped it to make an entirely new game. This would better off be marketed as a different installment to the Warhammer franchise as opposed to the sequel of Dawn of War.Is it fun? Yes, but I can't recommend it knowing that people liked DOW1 for what it was and will be expecting DOW2 to be more of that, which it isn't. This is an entirely different kind of game, and if you liked the original, you won't find more of that here.			",123,5,1,19,3,0,7

												I dont really know, how I should think about this game. While I played Dawn of War for its multiplayer, and Dark Crusade for its campaign (and multiplayer), Dawn of War 2 is like the two side of a blade.The campaign was...well...more than great, it was awesome! While you had simple unit progression in Dark Crusade, you had now the control over small squads you were able to level up, skill and equip!The campaign story itself wasnt that great sadly. The multiplayer is a desaster!Playing as the Bloodravens again, you have to defend their home system against a big horde of orcs and later tyranids.The campaign works like a round strategy game, where you equip your squads, control your planets and choose missions based on their urgency, difficulty and reward.Choosing a mission, the real game begins in RTS style and you have up to four unit groups to control. Every group is lead by a hero unit, that has special abilitys and weapons.Mostly fighting against overwelming enemy forces, you often have to fight tricky and stealthy, use good tactics and know, how to use your forces abilitys.With every mission you get XP and items and can specialize your troops on melee or ranged combat, health and ability points. You get new weapons and new equipment, and sometimes gamechanger like the terminator armor, that awesomely upgrades your troops (except the scout of course) and gave me a big wtf with the upgraded Space Marine Stormtroopers, with teleport and big hammers. Awesome!Having 4 units in every mission but a lot more usable units in your rooster, you can choose, which units you use in a mission, desiding on their abilitys and firepower and the enemys you will face.Now two things shall be said:The campaign is theoretically endless. You can play as many missions as you want. No pressure to do the final missions. You just have to hold down the enemys enough to keep the Xenos Infection low.The whole campaign is coop. Instead of 4 units, each player controls 2. Nothing more to say.Now the big bad:Beside the campaign, there wasnt really anything useful left in this game. I tried the multiplayer, but was highly disappointed. Buildings are completely gone in this game. You only have a main building and troops. Confusing, frustrating and totaly not RTS like. I played Dawn of War for a long time and I played Starcraft and Age of Empires 2 and I couldnt get any fun in the Dawn of War 2 multiplayer.I would like to give this game a good rating for its awesome campaign, but it hasnt much to offer beside it. It is like a HD version of Dawn of War without RTS gameplay. Why not making a complete Shooter out of...wait they already did that and it was awful...			",84,3,0,9,14,0,7

												Yeah this game is pretty boring, It's nothing like Soul Storm. you don't build bases and you don't get armies. It's like a moba but with a few more units to command. If that's what you like then go for it, the campaign is kinda fun, the story is weak, but other than that its really not worth it, maybe for a few bucks it is.			",100,24,1,3,10,0,17

												This is going to be the most difficult game review I've had to give. This game is fun, the 40k lore is on spot. It's not like the original dawn of war games, but it's still fun (imagine the first dawn of war games, but only units, no base building).The reason this is a negative review, is because the game has technical issues that prevent newer systems from working on it.The game DOES NOT have any framerate locking. No V-synch, or anything.Why is this a problem?Because I can play this game at 4k, ultra settings, 60FPS without any issue.So much without issue, that my GPU renders 100+ frames per second.That's bad. Uncapped framerate causes high-end GPUs to spit out as many frames as possible, causing overheat and system issues (lag).On menus, my GPU is rendering 2000+ FPS (Yes, two thousand plus frames per second). It absolutely burns up my GPU.And forget Alt-tabbing to something in the background, because even in the background the game is causing your GPU to be in an endless sprint. It made my computer feel like a windows XP, 3-4 second delays between clicks outside of the game while it was in the background.After about an hour of playing, the game will stutter for 5-10 seconds, every 30 seconds.I've tried turning it down to 1080p medium settings to see if that helped, but it did not. Infact it made it worse because my GPU was cranking out thousands of FPS in-game still.I really want to play this game.But my $650 GPU is worth more than a $20 game.			",34,1,1,10,11,0,10

												Decided to jump back in and try to play Orks on Normal difficulty, got attacked by a tank and antitroop weapon game two, whole team died, I remembered you're penalized for deaths. Quit game and forgot about it.The way this game penalizes death, as I recall from my first playthrough with humans, where i got 3/4 the way through, is that the enemies continue to get stronger, much faster than you, and your team's exp gain slows to a trickle.

												By far the best RTS game ever.. I cant get enough of the campaign.. Even though i now have to reattain all the achievments again, i dont mind.. DoW2 had many, many missions, and loot.. While DoW2:Chaos Rising added the Librarian, and Choas..Every other RTS has base building, like DoW1 did.. I loved DoW1, and all the expansions, but, i hate base building, and pvp of meaningless army blobs.. I prefer the way DoW2 handles your groups.. 1 Hero, and a teammate or two..Not having the beginning of every pvp match the exact same boring BS finding minerals, building bases, etc is one of the major positives imo.. Theres no  other RTS that does this, and i pray they keep this formula for DoW3, if it ever comes.. I did NOT like DoW2 Retribution, because it went back to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ group layouts of no name soldiers.. Not to mention, it boasts having 6 different campaigns, (1 per race) when in actuality its merely 1 campaign, played the same, from a different perspective.. Its exactly the same, 6 times.. I played each race once.. It sucked.. I cannot count how many times ive played DoW2, and DoW2:CR... Amazing! The graphics, for their time, were pretty good as well too.. And the added plus being, the horde mode(The Last Stand), which when people actually played it, was amazing.. Even added a Tau Commander, and Imperial for it.. Very fun!PS: Seems the fanboys really hate my view of base building  XDEdit: Seems DoW3 has been announced, and it looks like some colorful blizzard crap.. MOBA looking garbage, with all kinds of broken lore aspects.. Will be passing!			",60,13,0,15,1,0,6

												an awsome startegy game in all asppects. it's single player is really fun and is faced pased.the multiplayer is intense and has a lot of tactics. you'll need to carefully manage every single squad you have. there will never be a simple ""amass lots of units of one type and crush the opponent""the grahpics and physics engine add a lot to the experience.what's great about this game as well is that you can fully enjoy it even if you have it's expansion packs. each has their own uniqe campeign and gameplay mechanic.it is very satisfying in singleplayer to lead and coordinate your 4 squads of cyborg heroes to destroy armies of alien scum, setting up your squads to cover each other right and fight the enemy from the right angle can be challanging but very rewarding.managing your special items that you have collected in each misson to power up your squads to their fullest potential is also great.the multiplayer is just as good, instead of the old fashion base building game you mainly only control units.instead of crushin the opponent's base you need to secure victory points and hold them long enough.counter each opponents units that he sends against you and learn to quickly adapt to the situation, because it will constantly change.upgrading your units in the heat of battle and deploying all of their awesome abilities makes the multiplayer frantic, chaotic but stratigic and smart none the lessa must have for either WH40K, RTS or even RPG fans...

												Having played Retribution before I played the original campain, I had some idea of what to expect when i started to play this, and yet I was amazed by how good the original campain was. I got very into the campain, which probably ment that my experience was so much better. Would highly recommend trying to get the both dlc games, as the Chaos Rising campain starts right where you left off with the original, and both explain so much of the Retribution campain, so would highly recommend Dawn of War II, Chaos Rising and Retribution.

												This is cool and all but... seriously? Bought the game, excited for Necrons, install the game, excited for Necrons, open the game, V-sync issue is GAMEBREAKING. I have 4 or 5 bands of separately moving screen on every frame. Not a problem, I'll turn on V-sync when the game launches. Go to options menu, my game runs great at 88 fps average with ultra graphics. Congrats, NO V-SYNC. That is gamebreaking to me.Go to start a custom game to get used to DoW2, excited to play as Necrons, notice that there are only 5 races to play as, Necrons is NOT one of them. Will be returning this game, buying DoW3 MAYBE, if they have necrons. I might have been able to swallow my pride and stubborness over the Necron race if there was a v-sync option, but that is not a thing apparently or it is unecessarily difficult to find.If you are upset that the master race was not included in this game or if V-sync is a necessity to you, do not buy this game. Save your money.			",35,2,0,0,10,1,7

												This would be a very good solo game, in fact a great solo game, if it weren't so full of bugs it makes a compost pile look barren. There is some sort of memory leak which eventually causes the video to stutter at an unplayable rate. It seldom shuts down cleanly, nor does the steam client always recover. This is likely related, as rebooting completely fixes it temporarily. There are multiple places in the various maps where troops get stuck, and without warning 25% of your team is now useless. When it happens more than once in a mission you end up unable to finish. This is all made worse because there is no way to restart a mission. The challenge of not being able to replay is great, but when the game itself is this buggy it becomes frustrating, to the point of wondering why you even bothered. I can usually overlook bugs and other problems when a game shows this much promise, but in this case the promises are empty and I have to give it a thumbs down. Which makes me sad.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Have you ever wanted to BECOME a space marine? Well now you can tell them what to do in Relic Games Company's newest comsumer game.Use the mouse to click on space marines and click what they should be doing. Enemies will attack you, especially in multiplayer, so click fast. I reccommend buying a mouse with a good cpm (clicks per minute), at least 900. You could also use the keyboard, but f that.The game centers around space marines although there are differnet types. The tyrants are alien mutants who want to hurt the standard space marine chapter. there are also the Ork chapter which there are lots of, but they are pretty bad at being space marines relaly.The last race is the elders, but they are pretty dumb. Dont bother with these guys.There is no bases in this game. Do not build any base, because your one building does everything for you. It will do your technology and also your men.

												Dawn of War II is a squad based strategy game with elements of Role-play. The Role play aspects are similar to Inquisitor form the 40K universe. It uses cover and angles of attack for the squad based tactics. Included is the ability to have a Battle Brother join you in the campaign. Multiplayer has two primary modes: survivor and classic RTS with flavor. Survivor mode is a Last Man standing multiplayer with 3 other players. You can choose all of the races available in Dawn of War II in both multiplayer modes.  Overall the game and storyline is enjoyable.			",266,41,5,48,8,3,65

												A sequel that lives up to its predecessor. Instead of having you control entire bases, you command a small squad of Blood Ravens, though not the first game to come up with this idea, I certainly think it wins for sticking with it throughout. You may feel a bit overwhelmed in the beginning, but once you get the hang of the game mechanics this games becomes so much more than just another RTS, but stretches into other genres like 3rd personal tactical to an RPG.

												This is probably one of the most incredible rts games I have ever played. It's a squad based rts surrounding the Warhammer 40k universe which makes it even more phenominal. It's much like company of heroes in the multiplayer as you play with 5 different factions.The multiplayer also includes a last stand mode where you will fight off hordes of enemies using 1 of 5 heroes and playing with 3 other players.There is also a co-op campaign/single player campiagn and the campaign is phenominal. It's about 10 hours of gameplay if you play straight through and keeps you sucked into the action for a long time.I reccomend this game hands down if it's on sale it is a must have, though phenominal i did have some problems.cons: some squads got bugged and would not move (fixed so far by restarting the mission/game)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's get it clear, I love 40K! The Universe is just awesome!Now to the game, Dawn of War II is one of the greatest stragety games to come out of this genereation. It is different from it's base building predecessor as instead of building bases and armies you are building elite squads of men or Orks or what ever is available. One of the reasons why this game is awesome is because of the sound design, it's just great, every weapon has a big booming sound and it's just awesome!

												What should be an entertaining tactical strategy game is marred by a litany of baffling design decisions. Single-player campaign is a slow grind through predictable groups of opponents. Doesn't do a good job of pressuring the player or making you think tactically. Whole bases will wait while you clear one building at a time. The game falls particularly short when it tries to challenge the player with RTS ""bosses"". These are effectively standard opponents with a huge amount of health which will cause you to spend 10-15 minutes micromanaging your troops and running in circles to kill. They don't require thought or planning, just repetitive motion while you grind through the endless health pools. Story doesn't carry the dull gameplay, either. I couldn't bring myself to finish the campaign, and that's pretty rare.The game controls are somewhere between bad and unforgivable. Entering buildings causes your squad to be deselected, so you have to reselect them to tell them to fire on an opponent. You can't leave a building without taking all of your squads out of it. Attempting to select anything without using the hotkeys will result in disaster, with your force commander usually being selected even all the way across the map. Hotkeys seem to be assigned haphazardly, with no flow between the basic commands you will issue. Expect to wave your hand wildly about the keyboard unless you customize the business. The game also arbitrarily decides when to use right click and when to use right -- you try to activate a skill and you can't move or attack with right click, but you cannot use right click to use the skill, instead being locked out of doing anything except left click to use it or hit ESC to cancel. It doesn't make sense and is really just bad UI design.There are also technical issues. If the game crashes -- and it does -- the game considers your mission a failure and drops you two ""days"" behind. This can also occur due to GFWL fumblings, even as GFWL is on its last legs. There's no mid-mission save for missions that can last upwards of an hour. Something comes up? Find yourself an extra hour or the game considers you to have failed the mission. You have to wait until you can find another hour until you can attempt the mission again, because progress is not saved in any way: you start all over and have to depopulate the location a second time, taking just as long as the first time. It doesn't make sense, but that's pretty much the game in a nutshell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It feels like they took all the work and threw it away for no reason.  Still for the single player and new game mode alone. I would still say that this game is easily worth 20 dollars.

												One of the best RTS of its' gen. It is fast-placed, tactics oriented. If you like micro-management games like Starcraft, this may not be your cup of tea. If you prefer to focus more on your units and battlefield, than worrying about resources, bases building and who will press the X button faster to create workers/ buildings in time: Get this now.Single-Player: Great campaign, with good story even for non-Warhammer 40K fans. Nothing to do with the original Dawn of War, so it is easy to get into. Multiplayer: You get three modes. Co-op campaign, co-op PvE and competitive (PvP). The first is self-explanotary; you can play the campaign with a friend. Co-op PvE: My favourite mode, it is called ""Last Stand"". You basically pick a hero and fight waves of enemies, alongside with other people. It is your ""arena"" mode; something that we used to see in mods and maps in older RTS games -call me Starcraft, Warcraft II & III, LotR: BFME, etc etc. You have a choice of 4 unique heroes (more if you have the expansions), which you can level-up and get gear for individually. This mode is a bit like a ""free"" extra game that comes with DoWII. My only complain nowadays is the lack of online players.Competitive MP: Includes FFA and team-matches. The biggest cons: Not enough people online and that it still uses Game for Windows as a DRM. Due to the later, I lost my saves twice in the past...			",119,25,1,17,13,3,33

												I've been a fan of the Warhammer 40,000 Universe for many years now (even playing the tabletop games for a number of years). The Dawn of War Franchise has been without a doubt on of the most fun RTS series I've played, I'd fully recommend the first Dawn of War for the storyline alone, and though the subsequent games in the first series on the whole did away with such a strong narrative, the gameplay they gave was well worth the money. I'd also say to most people looking at DoW II to get the first Dawn of War just for the background which while not important at all in the second series, is just nice to have there. Now, for those who have played the first series, be prepared for a difference in game styles in relation to this. During the campaign thee is NO base building, you can't bring in new squads/vehicles throughout the game as you only have a maximum of 4 units deployed (though you can replenish loses easily enough or revive them if the squad is wiped out so that is not an issue). Even in skirmish/multiplayer the armies do not get as huge as the first game, because for example a tactical squad is only 4 men or a devastor/assualt squad only 3. However, this does not detract from the fun of the game. The maps are the perfect size, combined with the more tactical playstyle of needing to use cover and abilities well to make this downgrade in size of armies workable without issue. There is more customazation involved in this, especially during the campaign where you can upgrade your squads and specialize them, making an assault squad for example less mellee orientated but a more mobile tactical squad, and upgrade their armour and weapons through drops during missions. I'd honestly recommend any War40k fan who enjoyed DoW1 to get DoW2 if you're not sure. Even if you dont get the expansions it would be worth your time and effort. Only wait for it to be on sale as £20 for a game a few years old now is too steep and £15 at most should be its cost.			",30,0,0,1,3,0,25

												Dawn of War II is bar none my favorite RTS of all time. No resource management, no economy to manage, instead you have a few squads that can be incapacitated but not killed outright. The strategy comes in using cover, retreating and attacking, and using your squads powers in a synergistic way to overcome the enemy. This game is amazing and a must play for anyone who likes strategy games of any kind. Dawn of War II is one of those games that best in class. Don't miss it.			",327,43,3,41,23,3,74

												Dawn of War II has a captivating solo campaign and great visuals.  At times the gameplay is similar to the old classics ""Syndicate"" and ""Mech Commander II"".  This franchise is extremely well polished.  The game is extremely enjoyable providing some superb adrenaline pumping moments and often requiring players to make tactical choices and snap decisions under pressure.			",355,35,40,87,58,1,118

												Anyone who has ever loved the 40k universe would be hard pressed to be disappointed with this game. If however you were a huge fan of it's predecessor you may be not like that the base building mechanics have been replaced with squad based/ rpg elements. I for one thoroughly enjoy it because it reminds me of the tabletop game without all the bad dice rolls that can utterly screw you. I haven't played the retribution expansion yet, but i have played chaos rising and can highly recommend that as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the RTS that appeals to people even who don't like the generic RTS games. It has little to no basebuilding elements in the multiplayer modes and absolutely none in the campaign. This was my first game on steam and I was not disappointed; it gets to the action quickly and although it's not from a first person perspective has a lot of suspense as you may not know what's coming out of the fog of war. There is also a gamemode called the last stand, a horde mode in which you can choose and upgrade one of three characters however I would recommend retribution for this gamemode as it comes with three extra characters and a new map. Overall I would rate this game an 8/10 because it is a unique RTS but still has a few moments in which the game is insanely difficult and will screw you over if you haven't upgraded your troops properly but later installments have better versions of one of the greatest features (the last stand).

												DoW II isn't your Command&Conquer or Starcraft, it's more like Company of Heroes in space. There are no large armies, just a few squads you have to control. And that's quite enough: nearly no base building, no huge armies. Unit control, moving through cover, equipping your squads with the right kind of weaponery - that's what DoW II is all about. If you fancy base building and macro-management, DoW II is not your game. If you love a nice little skirmish and an immersive combat system, you will love it!Graphics, sound and art design are extremely well done - Relic recreates the WH40k universe once again very well.Only downside: No campaign for other races than Space Marines - the expansions may fix that.

												Similar to it's precedessor Company of Heroes, Dawn of War 2 is a squad based tactical RTS. You get a few Space Marines and have to equip them with weapons you find and select skills in order to best approach a variety of targets. It can range from easy to exceptionally hard. Any fan of either Dawn of War or Warhammer 40k will like this game.			",381,117,3,68,29,4,47

												Simple review: Get this only for the singleplayer campaign, which is a tad repetitive but still reasonably fun and pretty darn long - however for the Last Stand mode or multiplayer, get Dawn of War 2: Retribution since it adds all the Steam stuff.Since it is also so cheap now, especially in the Dawn of War 2 bundle, you'll likely get this by accident with Retribution anyway.

												Defintely one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. Wish more people would buy it. But, with THQ gone Sega now has the license to make WARHAMMER 40K games. Which if they have plans to do, I hope they succeed in the franchise of the WARHAMMER 40k universe. Simply, because I am a huge fan of not only of the games so far. But, also of the lore. Though this it nor your average RTS's, there is next to no base building (Which is mostly in Multiplayer anyways). The other thing is it's geared more towards having a elite group of veterans (Mostly in singleplayer). Which there is nothing wrong with it, in that regard, it turned out to be loads of fun.

												Dawn of War set the bar pretty high for RTS games, but DoWII took it to a new level. Rather than giving the player endlessly huge armies, it concentrates on building the characters, while still using a classic RTS-style interface. Telling the story of a desperate defense of the Aurelia sector by Space Marines who are besieged on all sides, feared by the citizens they're fighting to protect, cataclysmically outnumbered, and racing the clock, this game leads into two expansions, both of which are a blast. If you enjoy Warhammer 40K at all, you owe it to yourself to play this game.			",306,95,10,82,17,1,49

												Awesome game! I'm a life time strategy game player, and long time player of Starcraft 2; played it probably for 3 years with all the different mods. This one is real time strategy but much has shorter missions (they are more engaging) and you use small squads instead of huge armies. Took a bit to get used to the smaller squads, but after I did the single player campaign is a blast! What are you waiting for? Buy it now, seriously just buy it!			",3,1,0,2,1,0,8

												Despite few flaws--such as map recycles and the illusion of freedom in narrative progress--the game's single player campaign is, in the end, robust and highly entertaining. It compensates the lack of traditional RTS mechanics with addictive RPG elements, and overall offers a great cast of characters that the fans of the lore will certainly like. It may not be the most faithful sequel, but it certainly is a great game on its own: to call it a bad game would be a crime.			",172,32,6,27,16,2,52

												When I first started playing Dawn of War 2 I was honestly expecting a re-make of the first game series, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a game that could stand up on its own two feet. People who were familiar with the first game will remember the slightly bombastic cutscenes with in-game models and overly familiar RTS game play, and on these points DOW 2 innovates. Unlike most RTS games you're not expected to manage buildings, which is appealing. The visuals and voices also al feel well-scripted and satisfyingly re-create the chaos we've come to expect from the battlefield.However, if you're not a fan of Space Marines you'll probably be disappointed to discover the single player campaign is somewhat frustratingly geared only to this particular race. Furthermore, DOW1 actually attempted to characterise the protagonist through its cutscenes (Including a last minute plot twist that I found truly touching!) and this is where DOW 2 falls down a bit. Nobody has any real emotion aside from heroic anger or angry heroics, the Marines all talk with an irritatingly fake batman voice and the mute protagonist fails to strike any sympathy with me as a player. This is what comes of Games Workshop trying to characterise a race who are all literally clones of one another.So you'll find the meat of this game (The other 3 races!) in the multiplayer and custom game mode, and this makes for staisfying, if somewhat repetitive, fun. However you should prepare to be screwed around by EA-level connection issues as the game insists you connect to windows live even if you want to play offline, which earlier games managed to do without and adds absolutely nothing to the gameplay. I cannot fathom why anybody felt it needed this feature. Even though the game is competant in single player and multiplayer scenarios, it just can't marry the two together as seamlessly as Dark Crusade did. So yes it's a good game, but it's just not as rich with variety as Dark Crusade was. I don't see why it would have been impossible to have a DC-style campaign mode with four playable races, or even a multiplayer campaign of the same nature where multiple players fight their campaigns across a planet. So in the end it's not a terrible game, it just feels like it took away features from earlier games that worked, added features nobody wanted, and somehow makes the already characterless Space Marines feel even blander.

												If you're an RTS fan and sick of base building and resource gathering and more into action than this game will be perfect for you. Already good, but sometimes repetitive campaign with co-op + tactical multiplayer which is a blast. With the Chaos Rising expansion campaign raises up it's awesomness and new multiplayer rase will make this game kind of complete.			",109,13,5,24,22,0,34

												Dawn of War franchise is one of my favourite and I think both first game and the second game brought some new mechanics to strategy games. I would recommend these games anyone that likes the genre and sci-fi. One problem though these games require Games for Windows Live for which the support ends at the end of this year. Thus, games won't work next year. It is cool to do discounts and all that but whichever company that holds the franchise should do something about this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The campaign was very fun, though not as good as the orignal DoW.I really enjoyed the equipment/upgrade system. I'm a little dissapointed toward the end, I was hoping to finish optional missions however it does create another save so you can do the remaining missions.I honestly recommend this game to any RTS fan or just strategy fans in general. There were points in the storyline where I was very suprised as to how it the story played out.Although the last bossfight wasn't too challanging but it was still a really fun mission. Overall I suggest this game to hardcore Warhammer 40k fans and people who played the first DoWs, now I'm on to Choas Rising...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A unique fusion of the RPG and RTS genres, DoW II is incredible fun, shunning the Starcraft/Command & Conquer derived base-building and resource-gathering of its predecessor in favour of Diablo-style looting and levelling throughout the game's 20-some levels. Some prefer the 2004 original for its strategic elements, but I prefer DoW II as I feel it is the more interesting game, having carved out a niche all its own. The main campaign sees you play as a stoic Space Marine unit, although DoW II's excellent expansion packs have seen new campaigns introduced for several other Warhammer 40k races as well. In addition, the online play is extremely well-integrated, as one would expect from the developer of Company of Heroes. 9/10			",140,28,4,18,4,1,12

I personally haven't dabelled too much into the multiplayer vs modes, but they seem solid from what I understand if you're into that. The Last Stand mode is also a fun survival-type mode that should keep you entertained for quite some time as you try out all the different heroes and level them up.I would also add that the Chaos Rising stand-alone expansion is recommended if you buy this. They're pretty much made to go together.			",185,45,1,25,8,4,27

The skirmishes are a lot of fun as well, as deploying the larger units onto the battlefield was simply a joy.  Loved it when I first played it, and still love the campaign on another play through.

												This is a beautiful, intense and enthralling strategy game by Relic, gameplay is very similar to Company of Heroes but focuses on a single squad of badasses (and some redshirts) getting into all sorts of violent adventures against a plethora of different types of enemies, depending on how deep your pockets are to buy the expansion packs with. This game is truly great but my only complaint is the lack of variety in the maps; here is a game designed to be milked for hours to level your squadmates and get better equipment with which to confront the increasingly difficult battles you have to face (♥♥♥♥ the missions that pit you against Eldar tanks), and you're stuck with the same handful of maps for each planet you visit, same defend the generator missions, same set pieces every time. Some randomization in the map layouts would have given this game some real staying power. I did not care for the multiplayer at all but the single-player is where it's at anyway, and it's glorious despite its flaws. Visceral, personal, condensed tactical strategy done right.

												When I first played the Dawn of War II demo, I was among the groups that disliked the removal of base building and having limited squads. I refused to go further and went back to Dark Crusade.But one day the game was on sale and I thought, oh why not.And what I ended up experiencing actually was miles above what I was expecting.The removal of the bases and high Unit Pop. Actually ended up being in the game's favor for me!Sure sometimes you feel like amassing an army, but we have the other Dawn of war games to fill that void.The combat becomes very personal and requires your full management and focus. Giving a pretty intense battle. Based soley on your wits and use of the cover system and each squad's special abilities. Rather than just overpowering someone with numbers.Oh wait, we have a new race that can do that? Well there you go.The single player campaign turned out to be very enjoyable. Again the feeling of having a small loyal kick♥♥♥♥♥squad that you can put your confidence in feels very satisfying!And Last stand sweet in it's own right.My only complaint is sometimes squad AI can be derpy ever now and again. ""Darn it Avitus; you're not Thaddeus!""And the DlC's are abit pricey, as you'll end up paying 3x's what you paid for to play the full game.But! Still holds up very well and I am looking foward to whatever the Warhammer 40k universe brings us...Yes even you Eternal Crusade.			",44,7,1,7,5,0,5

Instead of endless streams of generic units. you have a small squad of unique characters to customise/specialize. Combat is a little hectic and requires a bit of micromanagement.Great enntry to an often abused franchise.			",95,5,4,8,2,1,6

												Warhammer 40k is a highly addictive Strategy game,the Graphics are beautifuly detailed provided you have the PC to run it. Gameplay wise its highly immersive, watching your troops get into a bloodbath with the enemy never gets old the particle effects are mouth watering. Worth buying for a RTS fan, a must have. I think they should go ahead with a sequel or even more DLC races and Campaigns to play as. As long as they do they will continue to have my support 10/10 Masterpiece.			",110,11,0,16,19,1,13

												Interesting strategy game that in single player is like RPG. You have just 4 groups of units, so it feels more like 4 units and you can upgrade them between missions. However the single player campaign is interesting and somewhat nonlinear.Multiplayer is completely different. It is very balanced and focused on battle strategy and not on building and economy. So you dont have to care about getting resources, you have to care how to push front line and when to fall back. Multiplayer is really interesting. And slightly similar to Company of Heroes.

												Way too late for this one to be relevant, but I have to point out how much FUN it is until you get mid-late into the game when defend/assassinate missions get repetitive as all hell and bosses with absurdly high amount of health show up. Argument could also be made that the game itself is short if you forgo all those optional missions, but different strokes. Still, DoW2 is a great game and definitely worth playing through even if you're singleplayer oriented like myself.			",908,390,16,194,90,8,172

												Dawn of War 2 and its expanisons continue the fantastic squad driven gameplay of the first Dawn of War intruducing familiar mechanics which have been polished and refined to the dull gleam of the war filled 41st millenium. The campaign is solid and introduces an RPG like element in the way you develop your hero units and unlock new types of squad. The joint effect of boosting your hero or holding them in reserve to bolster other squads was a welcome addition allowing you to leave heros you disliked or that didn't fit your playstyle behind, without being penalised for it. Voice acting is solid with some well known names voicing distinct if overtly archetypal characters in style with the setting, and the steady progression of the plot and set pieces doesn't too often detract from the tactical gameplay that this game exceeds at.Multiplayer is truely where this game shines though, with the introduction of the last stand game mode (now a standalone puchase due to its popularity) you can drop in for a quick match with friends fighting against waves of increasingly difficult enemies and develop strateges as a group before taking your freshly leveled character in with an entirely new set of tactics and abilities. It's beauty is in its simplicity by letting you fight the well known enemies of the series on mass with only one character and your ragtag friends.More traditionally though the standard multiplayer is also much improved with easy matchmaking and fast paced fights, against human opponents the easy to manage economy shifts focus strongly onto how units and terrain are used meaning players new to the RTS genre will find it easier to start, but leaves plenty of room for more experienced players to experiment with different combinations of units and tactics with a steady metagame evolution making no one tactic the standard play.Highly recommended to all players of RTS and as a solid introduction for players branching in from other genre's who are interested to see what all the fuss is about.

												The Dawn of War 2 series is the best PC adaptation so far of the Warhammer 40K tabletop game. This is a squad-based RTS. On each mission, you command 4-5 squads of Space Marines. Each squad is unique and has very different abilities. You decide which units you bring on each mission, and you spend points to level them up.Decent story, engrossing gameplay, good controls. But a word on controls. This game does not like alternate keyboard layouts (ie, Dvorak). Or rather, it does like them. Exclusively. Whatever is your default layout, that's what you're using in DoW2. So when the in-game tutorial says ""Press "" ; "" to use this ability"", you just need to know that means to hit the Z key on your standard QWERTY keyboard. Personally, that annoys the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me.Other than that, I got no beef. This is a great game if you like RTS and particularly if you detest base-building (which only ever made sense in C&C 1 and the Dune series). While you will need to capture buildings, you will never buy or build one.A word about multi-player: No.Just don't bother. It's stupid. It's Starcraft: Warhammer edition. It's base-building and mixed-unit combat. You don't have time to strategize; you just build what you can and send it out to fight.Until you get ""Retribution,"" which includes a magnificent multiplayer mode called ""the Last Stand."" In TLS, four players each choose one hero from the game's cast of characters and attempt to survive on a smallish map against infinite waves of enemies of every variety.This is some of the best multi-player action I've had in the past five years. It beats the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Starcraft 2, and it's something that's honestly new. If it is not, please correct me.Both ""expansions"" change the game a lot, and I've reviewed each of them separately.DOW2 gets an A+. Seriously. This is one of the best games I've ever played. It's one of the few games that I'll ever play all the way through multiple times. I just wish I was as good at it now as I was the first time I played through.I initially put a lot of time into the tactics and I got really good at deploying and managing the troops. I don't really do that anymore. I mostly Zerg with an occassional ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ Use a grenade!""			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												It's been more than half a decade and this game still holds up so well. I picked it up on steam sale and the purchase was definitely worth it - still is, even on regular price. No base-building, only tactical maneuvering and character customization. Think CoH where you equip your own soldiers.Pros:- intense yet fair gameplay (the times you really feel OP are few and far between, even during end game when you've maxed out)- RPG elements- cheesy Warhammer dialogue- giant hammers- noteworthy graphics- destructible environments- multiplayer's still kicking- LOOT!Cons:- bugs (ran into a bug that prevented one of my squad from moving; had to deal with a level-boss without him; lost.)- graphics problems- some tedious micromanagement, at times- lag (offline, what!?)- BUGS!BUY IT!

												A change from the firts Dawn of War series, but in my opinion, a good change. More RPG type things like upgrading and experience for the army. You can choose what units you use, and how you hack apart the tactical conflict. I like the choice of where and what battle to hit. Good story, good voice acting, the main heros were even kind of enjoyable. Good game overall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just the game u wanna play when u feel like commanding super human warriors who are damn near indestructable & you wanna kick some Xeno♥♥♥♥♥across the galaxy lol.V.Good game, Alot more tactical & story driven than its predecessors (which expansions seemed to do lil more than focus on base building & zerging opponents with a new unit per release).Stronly reccomended to warhammer fans & arm chair commanders who like or dont mind sci fi, a lil too heavy dependance on getting units into defencive cover i found but just my opinion. just in most war40k storys the space marines are described more like walking tanks in powerarmor that barely gets scratched lol.

												The game has a great atmosphere that only the rich Warhammer universe could provide, and probably the only Campaign I have actually played through to completion since Warcraft II. The multiplayer is also great, whether you're playing against the AI or a real opponent. Much fun also comes from the Last Stand mode where you select a hero with three other players in order to fend off waves of progressively tougher enemies. The only shame is that the online is pretty barren these days.			",22,0,0,4,2,0,4

												One of my favorite games. Good story, good characters, excellent tactical gameplay. Really not much more that needs to be said for that. If you like 40k or sci-fi in general and especially if you like squad-based RTS, this is for you.Just whatever you do, don't play on higher difficulties. The game devs felt that all that was necessary to raise difficulty was massively increasing enemy stats and occasionally adding in massively overpowered enemies. Which means you'll bee going through just fine until you round a corner and there's a carnifex with more health than your entire platoon combined that can take out any of your squad leaders in 2 hits and takes virtually no damage from the best weapons they could have equipped. Or a hovertank that will quite literally wipe out a squad with each and every shot. Combine this with one of the dumbest allied AI I've ever seen (""I'm going to run up and start stabbing that enemy structure instead of the hostile units already in melee with me!"" and ""I'm going to run past the sword-wielding maniacs to try and enter melee with some ranged units, even though I am not a melee unit!"" are two of the most common acts of idiocy) and you have a recipe for incredible frustration, especially if you're like me and you don't remember having anywhere near this much trouble just one difficulty lower. Basically, play on normal because that's when the game isn't being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			",50,11,0,25,5,1,30

												Strategy games have long been about who can build the most massive number of units the fastest in order to simply overwhelm the other player. Dawn of War II's cover system and 5 distinct races make for a play experience that is challenging in every engagement, not just a coin toss win/lose situation.Add to that a single player experience that combines the best of strategy games with Diablo-style loot, character progression, and skill trees, as well as a survival mode pitting 3 hero players against increasing waves of enemies, and you have a game that is incredibly easy to keep playing and find satisfaction in.

												This is a pretty decent squad based RTS. Unfortunately, it takes a different approach of their last games. In the other DoW games, you would construct buildings and then slowly upgrade your forces to amass a large force. I'm not sure if they made a update or expansion for this, but it is a quite good game considering it's change from the prior games.			",191,18,8,18,12,1,35

												A good game. I prefered the first Dawn of War since this one has removed the buildings side of the game (you can't build anymore during the campaign). Also, the number of squads is limited during missions. Still, all the rest is very good, with added RPG elements, with a super nice Armory that allows you to equip your troops as you wish and with a dynamically evolving campaign that gives you a selection of missions. Also, the graphics, the music, the sound are great. A major downside is that this is a Game for Windows Live (GFWL) and this single fact is the source of a ton of frustration. Imagine, I played the campaign a few months ago and now that I've changed my computer and wanted to continue, nothing has been saved online. Even if I had saved the whole folder from ""My Documents"", the game just wouldn't reckonise it and I had to restart all over again. But apart from that downpoint, it's worth a try for RTS fans and a must for WH40K fans. I just hope DoW3 brings back more buildings!			",25,4,0,14,2,0,18

												If you really like the Dawn of War universe, this is more of what you've come to expect. However, the gameplay has moved away from the macro-focused RTS style and more into hero units and micromanaging. It's very little like Dawn of War I. This was disappointing for me (DoW is my favorite RTS) but maybe you will enjoy that sort of thing. Also, this game goes on sale ALL THE TIME. Don't buy it for full price unless you a sucka.

												You know the hero class from Warcraft III? This game pretty much took that concept and ran with it. You don't so much gather materials and build armies, but rather use the limited resources available to you to play a chess game against the npcs. It can get boring for some and if you pick the wrong squad(s) you can really have a tough battle. I would only recommend this game if you're a Warhammer 40k fan.7.0/10.0			",140,29,1,18,16,1,25

												A solid DoW title.If you're a fan of tactical strategy, this is definitely for you. Single-player contains a lot of different elements that effect how the actual fight goes on the battlefield. Even with the different units, you can try out different synergies. Like holding an advancing unit at bay with avitus and ordering Thaddeus to tear them apart with a tactical air strike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When Starcraft, Warcraft and Company of Hereos had a gang bang and produces this masterpiece.When you like Starcraft and Warcraft but the gameplay mechanics are somewhat outdated.When you like Company of Heroes but wish that the theme was a futuristic fantasy.It's got factions from both Starcraft and Warcraft with the gameplay mechanics of Company of Heroes.Space Marines are basically TerransOrks are OrksEldars are basically elves or ProtossTyranid are basically the ZurgOne downside to this game is that the units in multiplayer skirmishes are really limited.But for an early game that was prdocued before Company of Heroes, it is really a next gen RTS at the time of its release.I also really like the theme of the game. There's not much RTS games using these kinds of ""futuristic fantasy"" themes anymore. Probably Starcraft II but hey, it's a completely different game.			",86,8,1,5,4,1,22

												A decent RPG, which relies on you keeping only a few Squads alive- you rarely control more than about 11 Marines, and then you slaughter thousands of the enemy over the course of the game, which is about 27 battles long, but you can easily squeeze it out to 40 or 50 long, which is about 40 hours- that is just single player.Also, you can customise your squads in Single Player, which means you can tailor your squads how you like- my Captain, however, is at home in combat or at range, whereas my Tactical Marines were tough as hell to hold the line, etc.Multiplayer is great, but better with friends. Game modes include:Last Stand- Play with a single Leader model with 3 other friends.Multiplayer- Team games or 1v1, 2v2, etc.Worth it for £20? Maybe. But I'd suggest the £30 deal for this and the next 2 expansions.			",109,44,0,29,28,1,37

Its a gem of a game with lots of possibilites and i hope that a DoW3 comes out. If you like RTS with a bit of RPG components and a rich story then this is the game for you.

												This is an excellent skirmish level Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game; and if you happen to be a WH40K fan, so much the better!  Look and feel of the game is similar to Company of Heroes.  You have to capture certain strategic items on the battlefield and hold them in order to gain resources to muster up more units, there's no base building, and although the single-player campaign on features the Blood Ravens space marines, you get to play as the Eldar, Orks and Tyranids in multi-player.  It is an outstanding game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The removal of buildings in the campagin has given this game a more puzzely statgic game wtih just as much satisfaction as the old ones. You'll need to be quite sure of how you want to play the game though, because changing tactics and squads could mess up your jam and make things difficult.

												A game with a difference - Combining the strategy of the original Dawn of War with a new aspect of RPG, Take control of your hero and upgrade him to be a Tank with melee and Bolter or Hammer and shield or perhaps a Heavy DPS with an autocannon - or if your really want to do some damage, put him in a Terminator Suit and smash through those nasties.Reminiscent of the original cross class game ""Kingdom Under Fire"", DoW2 is a serious time sink that many would consider well wasted.9/10 Dragons			",521,147,16,113,91,8,120

												Heaps of fun & a really nice evolution from Dawn of War I.DoW I featured the classic ""build your base & advance your units into the meat-grinder from there""-concept seen in many other Real Time Strategy games. A word of caution, do not enter this game while expecting the same as Dawn of War I.DoW II is different as it forces you to focus your efforts by presenting only a handful of units, with varying abilities to the player. Bases being virtually non-existent, you advance trough the maps with various objectives at hand, most often consisting of, but not limited to: Kicking♥♥♥♥♥			",140,20,1,10,18,0,31

												Among my favorite Warhammer titles and favorite strategy games period, Dawn of War II is the beginning of a three-part epic tale of the battle for the Blood Ravens' recruitment worlds, continued with the Chaos Rising expansion and concluded in the stand-alone Retribution. This title reperesented a considerable departure gameplay wise from the first Dawn of War and its expansions, moving away from base building, resource gathering and large-scale battles towards a smaller squad tactics format seen in the earlier Company of Heroes series, from which Dawn of War II borrowed its graphics engine: a shift that was not universally welcomed. Dawn of War II is a blend of real-time squad tactics and an RPG loot-and-level system that I found deeply engrossing. The campaign is heavily story-driven and takes you to a variety of environments, including the interior of a space hulk made famous by the turn-based series of that name. Excellent music, visual effects and voice work accompany the proceedings. Series mainstays the Space Marines, Orks and Eldar returned, along with newcomers in the fearsome Tyranids, not featured in the first game due to, supposedly, engine limitations. Epic, pitched battles and a surprising end-game return of a popular character from the first game wrapped up the experience for me in the best way possible. The main flaw of DOW II was its use of the Games For Windows Live client, but it has since been updated to remove that particular pustule. An excellent title overall and worth playing today.

												Dawn of War 2 is a fast-paced, tactics-focused game that's a lot of fun to play.  Sometimes it can be a little chaotic with all the action, but that makes it more awesome :D Single player is nice, but I would recommend playing it co-op as it's a lot more fun. :)			",257,32,19,22,41,3,43

												I will put this in a simple comparison, think command and conquer 3 without base building, awesome equipment that makes large impact, great skill trees that really matter and a looming threat that you have an impact on. But really this game is great for people who miss the 'ol RTS game with a well deserved modern twist. PLAY THIS GAME, (bad pun) or I will daw a war on you...			",42,12,1,10,16,0,13
