												This is the hardest ♥♥♥♥ing game I've ever played. When you can't beat the third mission on easy there's something wrong. I mean sure four guys vs a gazillion tanks and infantry with mounted guns everywhere shouldn't be possible IRL and I guess the game simulates this pretty well, but... it's a game and it's fun to play as it actually has an intersting, realistic campaign that shows the true colors of the Red Army in contrast to Company of Heroes 2. If you beat this game you're a masochist and you got my respect.			",329,74,14,35,26,4,69

												UPDATE: I'm currently going through a second play-through of this game.  Literally the hardest and most frustrating strategy game I have ever played, but I still love it.  I see a lot of negative reviews for this game, but if you love Men of War, then you'll love this.  Each mission will take you between an hour to three hours to beat.  REMEMBER: Save the game as often as you can! You will be redoing many parts of every mission many times! And if you're giving this game a negative review because it is too difficult, then you're not a real Men of War fan. It is actually enjoyable for me that this game is extremely tough.

Men of War: Red Tide Review - Rating: 8.4/10General ImpressionMen of War: Red Tide is a nice strategy game. The graphics and the textures are pretty nice. The atmosphere mostly happens in areas with water surrounding them, such as islands, coasts, etc. The battles also happen in villages, towns, forests, fields, military bases (pretty rare) and even other environments. The audio is pretty nice, I like the sound of everything. What is pretty noticeable: the guns’ sounds. They are pretty loud. This makes the game more realistic. The music is nice, especially the menu one, it really makes you feel nationalist. The gameplay is complex, in each mission you have to complete a lot of tasks, alike killing specific enemies, destroying specific units, combating all enemies on the map, reaching a certain point, etc. The story focuses on the Russian side, which, in this game, will have various battles with the Germans, Italians and the Romanians. It has 6 campaigns. Some of them are long, some of them are medium and 2 of them are short. The missions, which describe the story, happen in places where in the real-life soldiers also fought, due to the fact that this game is a RTS. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and well-synthetized information. I also like the overall design of it. The controls are pretty good, except with 1 thing: the rotations’ controls of the cameras. I highly recommend you to reset them with the arrow buttons. The engines, just like in every Men of War game, are not perfect. The game has rarely crashes, and when it crashes, you obviously lose the progress of your mission. Try and save the game as often as you can, in order to avoid too much progress lose. You don't want to waste your time by restarting the mission from zero, right? The mechanics are sophisticated, being pretty nice and everything moves well-optimized. I also like how the infantry moves on the hills. Now, I’m going to talk a little about the G.E.M. editor. Just like in every Men of War game, you have a G.E.M. editor. You can create your own battles in it. It is complex and with a various number of functions. What I don’t like in this particular G.E.M. editor: first of all, you can’t drive airplanes. That’s a shame, especially that airplanes feel pretty nice. You drive it in the air, you have the freedom to control it however you want. And secondly, the amount of content is not that extraordinary either. There is pretty much content, but compared to Men of War: Assault Squad (both 1 and 2), isn’t the same content-filled. But, since it was made in 2009, I could say that the content in this G.E.M. editor isn’t really a major problem. Overall, this game is a nice simulation of the Russian side of World War 2.Positive PointsPretty nice and well-designed graphics and texturesNice audio and nice musicFun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the 6 campaigns availableInfantry, immobile guns, batteries, vehicles, tanks, airplanes, ships and many other units available3 difficulties availableA nicely designed user interfaceSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNeutral PointsTrading cards would be a nice featureThe editor should have more content, including being able to drive airplanesThe driving of the ships should be somewhat betterNegative Points The multiplayer is not alive anymoreThere are some rare crashes, like in all the Men of War games  ",655,158,18,43,61,10,68

												As part of the men of war series this game is a weird one, it's not great but not bad. On one hand it lacks a lot of the polish that the other games have, i lot of things are missing for example the main menu music or credits at the end of the story, the story itself seems even more like a collection of missions extremely loosely tied together. on the other hand the game does bring some new gameplay focused on the navy, you get to control large battleships, submarines, assault boats and small boats, this adds some variety and extra strategy options, also this time you control a smaller amount of soldiers in each mission and you often have to take whole towns all by yourself, and often fighting behind enemy lines adding to the games difficulty, it's definitely harder than the other games but not impossible, the single-player lasted 20 hours. If you're a fan of the men of war games you should play it.			",214,33,5,16,16,1,25

												Ну что, тяжелая стратегия, кидая сразу в гущу событий, дает под управление амрмию, противник, который всегда преобладает в колличестве и качестве, промахи в тактике не прощает совершенно и отряд который бъет в лоб разбивает без потерь, Правада в дальнейшем (на момент написания каментария прошел 1-ую главу) дают уже маленькие отряды и воевать приходится более продумано, т.к. пока контролируешь захват позиции одними, в других уже гранаты кидают. После любой перестрелки приходится чистить карманы противника ибо патроны у отряда не бесконечные и тратятся достаточно быстро, тоже самое с любой техникой.Это не просто стратегия, а в неком роде симулятор военных действий, в большинстве случаев приходится работать в тылу и надо всегда проявлять извращенность ума, что бы отобрать или уничтожить военную технику противника.С такой сложностью и интересным гемплеем рекомендую однозначно.

												Red Tide is the second chapter in the Men of War series, presenting WWII engagements from the Russian perspective, refreshingly.  There are some subtle improvements over the original.  Large battles in particular are much easier... you are given a relatively small force to command, and the AI forces will advance as you do.  It is strictly a single player campaign, with some challenging maps, even on easy.  I love the game despite its difficulty.  When you are intimately familiar with the controls, and nimble with the view options, every engagement is a treat visially and tactically.  The only thing I would ask for is a replay option that records your battle and then allows you to observe the battle later or share with friends.  Hopefully that option will appear in the Vietnam version due later this year.			",370,73,24,59,48,1,80

												This game is steadily working it's way to become my all time favorite Men of War game. It is a bit buggy sometimes on missions and it is not uncommon to restart a mission sometimes when things just go completely wrong and you get yourself into a position where you just cant win the mission anymore. No music during gameplay (who needs it) and on average missions are hard and require a more deeper analysis of the field in order to figure out how to advance and sometimes there just isn't any easy way forward - which in turn makes for a good atmosphere as we are playing as russian infantry here so one can expect things to get icky and sticky.  Them bodies just keep piling up it seems. And not just enemies this time. First couple of missions can be really tough even on Easy so be warned. Other than that it is very much like Faces of War and Men of War as far as game mechanics go. Game also likes to bring in new units outside the map and/or expand the game area once a objective has been reached. If you are considering MoW series do not start the MoW series with this game. Red Tide is 'advanced class' material so be warned.edit: completed all missions. This game is indeed the best in the series. Hard and demanding but oh so rewarding.			",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												Men of War: Red Tide is a strategy game developed by Digitalmindsoft and published by 1C Company. This game was released in November 2009 and is a sequel to Men of War. It is set in World War II and features a campaign that recounts history of the Soviet Union and its battles through a 20 mission campaign. I personally really enjoyed its predecessor Men of War, but this game is terrible. Furthermore, I wanted to like this game, but I quit after 90 minutes and on the second mission and uninstalled it after giving up. I want to shed some thoughts on why I think its bad because their are many individuals that enjoy this game. Therefore, this review will discuss the positives and negatives of this game.I am familiar with the gameplay and overall feel of the game due to playing Men of War, which is very similiar. You command your squad and you order them to attack in order for you to complete your objectives. This game is realistic  because for instance, tanks destroy infantry, infantry can kill in one shot, and infantry must use tactics to get close to the tank to destroy it. Furthermore, it promotes strategy through tactics and I commend this. There is the micromanagement of supplies aspect in this game, which I adore and was seen in Men of War. The idea coincides with realism as your soldiers need to steal medical supplies and ammo from dead soldiers inventories after using ammo or those supplies. These two positives are standard in the Men of War series, as I did play the later released Men of War: Assault Squad.There are two negatives in this game that annoyed me and/or made me quit. The lighter negative is the voice acting. As this is set in the viewpoint of Russia, I was confused on why American voice actors were recounting battles in the loading screen prior to the battle and why there was mostly American voice actors having dialogue in battles. If this was not confusing enough, the voice acting was bland as it feels overly scripted and not natural. Moving on, the main negative is the AI, which is absolutely awful and made me quit. I am not the only one that has experienced bad AI as many negative reviews for this have reinforced that notion. For instance, your objective is to neutralise the artillery so you need a responsive squad to get around the artilley and machine gun nests. The AI instead runs in circles after I order them to move, wonder whether to be prone, crouched, or standing, and does not automatically shoot the enemy in front of them. These three issues within the AI absolutely make me cringe because the idea of a non-responsive AI and a realistic game where they can easily die, it makes for a terrible playing experience. I feel this game has gone backwards because Men of War featured solid AI that was responsive and tactical and this being the sequel has ruined the series for me.I did not want to downright bombard this game with negative comments because I enjoy the overall gameplay mechanics and atmosphere of the game, hence the positive comments that this game expands upon following the first game. But, the negatives of voice acting and mainly the AI have made me uninstall this game within 90 minutes unfortunately. This is a personal review so as mentioned before, not everyone will agree with this but coming from a strategy fan, its unfortunate I experienced this. I recommend avoiding this game.Ratings:Overall: 2/10Thanks for reading my review!

												""Men of War: Red Tide"" is a WW2 RTS video game made by ""best way"", a Ukranian studio. Unlike the previous ""Men of War"", this is a singleplayer only game, and it does not have official mods support.The game is cut into 6 parts, which can be summaried into a sentence: A tale of brave navy men on the Black Sea	 Chapter One: Odessa must be ours!	This will show you the battles in 1941 between Romanians and Russians and you will be granted with infantry men.(no tutorial) Chapter Two: The Crimean Offensive	The story also happens in 1941. The Germans, lead by Meinstein are launching an offensive in order to take Crimea. Defensive Battles should be expected. You will also see the Soviet counter-attacks that falls the 42nd Army Corps. Additionally, you will be able to play as the Soviet paratroopers(rarely seen in WW2 games)and fight behind enemy lines. Chapter Three: Minstein's Big Guns	This is a legendary story of a group of Soviet soldiers fighting behind enemy lines in 1942. The main objectives are to blow up transport trains and  German & Italian infanstructers. Heroes will also destory the German Rail way artillery ""Bruno"". Germans & Italians will fear soldiers under your command. Chapter Four: Breaching the Blue Lines	Finally, here comes some sweet assaulting missions: powerful vehicles will be with you: Shermans, Valentines and even the Rocket-launching boats! Chapter Five: Company of Heroes	A company of heroes taking the fort of Nikolaev Chapter Six: Reclaiming the Black Sea	One mission included: to liberate Constanza. This time, some Romanians will join your army. German troops are busy destorying the city and you must stop it ASAP. Control the city for ""The Motherland""! Be ware: elite troops with Stg.44 spotted Additional Content	An encyclepedia which shows the history background of those missions Impressions	 The game could be a DLC for ""Men of War""	1. +It does add some new vehicles and some of them are amazing2.+Better Graphics compare to ""Men of War""3.-They almost did nothing with the music4.-God! the weapons sounds are worse than previous ones5.-Weird weapon mechanics. For instance, the SVT 40 is not completely semi-auto6.+They added more environment sounds, but the downgrade is, in actual levels, you will hear cow or dog's sound but you will not find them.....7.+New Factions: Soviet marines. paratroops, German naval forces, Italian forces and Romanian Forces(You only see them as ""Red Tide Mode"" in MOWAS2)8.-No multiplayer, no official mod support9.-the encyclpedia is a ""whatever"" thing10.They never fix the brain dead AI. (Tips#1: make sure you click the ""arrow button""and tell them to hold their ground. Tip#2: please make sure you don't select all units at a time and please command your tanks seperately--the tanks would get stucked by themselves even right on a bridge)11.~third person mode(actually very innovative idea)12.+Multiple approaches(gun blazing & stealthy) in order to complete missions.Many people around the community think this is a moderate Men of War game. I absolutely agree with that(If there is a specific button of ""moderate""). The one thing  I like about the game over other ones is that the game does not spawn infinate enemy soldiers.All these wraps up into one sentence:   If you are a Men of War collector, buy this; If you are not, buy MOWAS2 only	 ",56,1,0,1,9,0,23

It also have a MP mod. Very Realistic. Good for those who like Great battles and Never ending Beach invasions. Also some Special Ops mission... Thats why I got cheats mod...

												Its a good enough game for 3.50 but the AI is terrible, expect men to sit there looking at the enemy and forgetting how to use a trigger, expect men running out in the middle of the field and trying to throw grenades half the time you issue an attack order, I heard this game is supposed to be hard even on easy, so far its proved to be quite easy, the only thing that thus far has been a challenge is trying to work around the horrible AI			",99,4,4,7,11,0,21

												By far one of my most favourite WWII RTS games!Gives me all kinds of nostalgia playing Sudden Strike as a kid :)The good:- Very challenging - Autosave a lot!- Surprisingly detailed- Plenty of destructible environmentsThe bad (in my opinion):- Very challenging - Forgot to autosave!- Too micromanage-y for my taste (like making sure every one of your soldiers always has health, ammo, etc.)- AI isn't quite up to parAll in all, If you like a tough RTS challenge, you might want to give it a try!Also, if you speak Russian or would like to learn Russian then definitely use the full Russian audio support - the voice acting is WAY better than the English version :P			",87,20,2,22,27,3,23

												Well well, Men of War certainly reached its hardest here. Completed the long brutal campaign to show Russians packed with balls of steel who could take out just about anyone, no need for vodka supplies. The game offers scenerios that's built on fueling frustation for anyone who wants jagged their veins to a pulstating state. More so, you have this one mission where a couple of anti tank guns are offered, and only 5 guys control to defend horde of German tanks and soldiers, yes you read, FIVE, in a game that has Boomarang like A.I which takes a while to return back its response after telling your men in crouch mode to get the hell up and run if they're in enemies's sight. It takes 2 seconds for them respond. If these gripes can be ignored, then you're in for a bumpy colossal ride that even two Company Of Heroes would be put to shame in its sheer brutality when it comes to difficulty.  8/10			",67,2,2,2,3,0,17

												As of writing this review I only have 6.8 hours into the game and I want to play many more hours. The game can be difficult and frustrating (even on easy) but it adds to the fun of the game. You have to plan your every move and come up with a strategy to complete objectives and one wrong move could end up in failing the mission or one of your units being wiped out. The enemies are positioned in ways that make it next to impossible to just rush in guns blazing. In many missions the odds are stacked against you and you have to do your very best to make sure you don't lose many troops. Now the game isn't without faults. Sometimes your units will get stuck on walls or something when you go to move them or they'll move right out into the open and get gunned down. There's been a few times where I've had units get gunned down despite the fact that they should have been out of enemy sight. And then there's the occassional times where your troops will not fire at enemies even though they may be set to 'Fire at Will' or 'Return Fire'. But these issues don't happen often enough for them to become major issues that ruin the game. If you like strategy games that give you a challenge this game is definitely for you. There are very few strategy games I've played that have given me such a challenge and sense of accomplishment when I complete missions and I strongly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great strategy game! Definitely a pick for all commandos fans! It does something that no other WW2 strategy does by combining point and click unit orders with full on keyboard control of movement and shooting for an individual unit. Physics in this game are amazing and level of detail is superior to all strategy games I've played. Damage to buildings and vehicles is very realistic and you can do things like setting dry grass on fire to burn enemies that are hiding in the fields. Really cool! Highly recommend!

												The AI are too stupid. They constantly get stuck and don't go where you want them to go. The enemy has way too many tanks to just throw at you. I got too frustrated to even play by the SECOND LEVEL! The game is telling the user to go to the left and fight the enemy over there but the second you get there an armored truck with three AT guns (I think they are AT guns, please correct me if i'm wrong) plus a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of enemys in trenches await to mow you down. This brings me to my next problem with the AI. When you send your troops into the trenchs when you've maraculously cleared them, they want to go to the STAIRS on either side of the trenches. I have tried to go to the right side, but by the time I clear it I don't have enough men to attack the left side... By the time they've gotten to the stairs, the armored truck has either run them over, or has mowed all of the guys down. I don't even want to play anymore at this point. I've spent three hours on this same mission (The second mission I mean. The first one was alright once you get the hang of how the game works.) and I STILL cannot seem to be anywhere close to beating it! If you figure out how to win it, please let me know! I wouldn't recomend this to anyone I know unless they fix the AI or I tell them to buy it as a prank on one of my buddies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I beat the entire game. Do I get an award yet?In all seriousness. This game is a sort of ""sibling"" to Men of War, focusing more on the U.S.S.R (The Black Sea Fleet/Seamen respectively.) than the last game. And it's not some sort of quick-cash in that adds maybe 1 or 2 more missions. No no no, it adds many more. And they are (mostly) all hard as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Even when I replay them. I still reccomend getting Men of War and Men of War: Red Tide over getting something like Company of Heroes 2. Which is basically reccomending two games that are five dollars each, over getting one game that is 40 dollars.And the reason I say this...?You can't have a tiger blown up by rifle fire in this game.In all seriousness though. GET THIS GAME AND Men of War. You will not regretti. And have lotsa spaghetti.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've finally started playing MoW as I finished up old episodes of Close Combat and Company of Heroes, and I can say that this is a very satisfying game, striking a balance between the two aforementioned titles.  Similar in scenery and thatrics to CoH, MoW has more of a serious tactical side akin to the Close Combat or Combat Mission series.  Also, there aren't many games at this level about the 1941 'Siege of Odessa'; Red Tide fills in admirably.			",48,15,0,6,12,1,18

												In case some of you missed ""Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2"", this is one of a series of games made around the same engine and gameplay. ""Company of Heroes"" borrowed heavily from this title, including some interface design and the ""unit direct control"" feature. Out of the entire franchise, this is the best one in my opinon. Get it first if you are unsure about which Men of War you want to try. Oh, and don't forget to read the encyclopedia and memoirs of veterans, otherwise you lose out on the atmosphere.The game is perfect for an accomplished masochist in terms of difficulty, so use an old keyboard and preferably and old computer too (it's a good thing the engine is over ten years old), unless you want to destroy your main PC in a fit of rage. Save often, use grenades over direct fire and never trust your units unless you control them yourself.			",325,44,7,56,59,0,124

												It dousn't seem to add anything to Men Of War outside of being exclusively Russian. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ quasi suicidal AI with even more of the Jank. Has nothing over the original and seems even more duct tapped together. Atleast Assault Squad lets you make more units. Thats a fun and cool addition. Its just more of the overly hard because your guys often don't listen to you or you had no idea there was going to be arty there type of gameplay that I have no interest getting anymore of from MOW.Color me dissappointed.I only played the first mission, but I just got bored and it seemed like it was just going to be another ""slam your face against a wall until you find the weak spot then try again"" types of game that MOW can be at times but the first mission just seemed like thats all it was. A slog through the uninteresting and not very fun mud.Spent 51 minutes on the first mission only to lose because I had no real idea what I was supposed to do besides ""clear the village"" which had a tank and a ton of infantry in the very back and me with no AT capabilities left and no AT to pick up. Very first five minutes the game tells you to ""check those crates for AT rifles"" or some♥♥♥♥♥♥via contextual voice. Those crates were empty. I was unsure of what I was supposed to do so I just rushed the tanks with infantry and took a whole line of them out that way. Not even sure what I was ""supposed"" to do there but meh. Assault Squad is probably the pinnacle of the series. This is down there with Vietnam to me.			",329,48,6,36,35,3,74

												Ok your first mission, you start of by landing on the beach on the left side of the map. This part wasn't very easy, and I enjoy a challenge. You only get 3 units of infantry to charge into howitzers and tanks and MG's. I lost, maybe 2 times. The next part, Jesus Christ it was impossible. You're supposed to take a village with 2 squads. The village is forified with MG's, tanks, and is being watched by a hill with an armoured car, with a 37mm gun. Taking the hill is hard enough. And the howitzers on the hill that may begin to barrage your men in he village, can't even hit near the village once you use them! Even if you get past this part, the next part brings in a wave of enemy tanks, and that is when I gave up. This game is simply unplayable unless you are an expert strategist. I do not recommend this, or the first one. Get Assault Squad, as it is much better! Have a nice day, if you read this!			",31,6,0,5,8,1,7

												While the Men of War series lacks the cosmetics of most depth-lacking RTS games, Men of War: Red Tide has good fit and finish but is a wreck when it comes to actual game play.  The stupidity of infantry AI never ceased to amaze me.  And example: my squad has a clear shot at a MG emplacement and I want them to attack it, with small arms fire of course.  What do my soldiers do?  They  stand up and run straight at it and try to throw anti-tank grenades at the MG.  Every member of the squad is killed within five seconds.  Your soldeirs also start the game with nearly no ammunition or first aid leaving you to constantly be on a savanger hunt for these things.  Always holding the V or tab key down looking for gear keeps you from being aware of whats happening on the battle field.  Sometimes this game gets so difficult you start to think that the game is meant to be played from the side of the computer who has to repel your attacks or attack themselves.  The balance seems far to slanted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the worst RTS games i have played in my life. The AI is unbelievably stupid, and cant even handle a simple move order you issue to them. I cannot tell you how many times i have lost a mission due to stupid ai and poor pathing. The game would have been good, but the ai is so bad that it ruins the rest of the game.

												I've just wasted 10.00 on this game. The game play is ok, but they are missing several game systems i liked from the vanilla. Mainly, I just wanted to play as the italians or romanians, but I 1st have to complete the russian campaign first, and it pisses me off to new levels. also, i wanted to use the editor to make custom battles, but there is no editor.
