												I liked this game quite a bit. It does the whole trade thing pretty well. It's definitely one of the better economy games released recently. It not only allows you to build ships and set up trade routes but also allows you to build colonize and maybe be a pirate if you want. I'll go into some pros and cons:Pros:-You aren't stuck playing the economy game. You can play a military game by being a pirate or fighting with other countries.-The game does the trading really well. The amount of resources aren't overwhelming (although the amount also isn't very impressive either). It's easy to just jump into the game.-There is a good amount of ships and you can customize each one you build by spending a little extra money.Cons:-The colony management is a little too simplistic. It does add to the game but it is only picking a building you want to build from a list.-There are only limited colony spots that you can build colonies on. I would've liked to just see where the resources were and build a colony accordingly.-You have to buy the resources from your colonies to sell them in the Home Country (Europe) and, as far as I can tell, you can't trade with other colonies. Instead you trade resources via diplomacy but those resources can only be traded via diplomacy and you cannot sell them in Europe. Because of this it is very possible to go negative and you can't do anything about it.All in all it's a fun game and I would recommend it. Especially now (11/27) with a sale going on. Certainly worth the $4 for the base and $6 for the complete.			",188,34,3,58,73,1,69

												Commander: Conquest of the Americas is a flawed but still interesting game about the age of sail and colonisation. You start your game as one of the European nations trying to colonise the new world, from the northernmost tip of Canada down to...The northern part of Brazil. Sorry South America, you're not allowed in here, this game is about the north only.You are thrust into the role of the colonial governor and have to colonise the new world. To do so, you'll be sending out a fleet to find a place to settle, and then you will be bringing in new colonists and exporting the products from there to the old world. In time, you will end up with multiple colonies and you will have to set up trade routes and pirate hunting patrols. You will mainly be doing this as you sit back and watch your new world empire grow, trying to make a profit and making sure your advisors are happy so they don't try to get the king to replace you.The campaign stuff is limited, and somewhat repetitive. The AI nations do not really offer you much of a challenge, and it is easy enough to take out their new world holdings and fleets. Given a bit of planning and thinking ahead, you can turn a massive profit and conquer most of the world. You will then be pretty much just waiting for things to happen as your automated routes take care of everything else.The game mostly does well in the ship battles, where up to 3 squadrons of 5 ships per side can join battle in a realistic simulation mode that I have not yet been able to find anywhere else. This is my main reason for saying this game can be a good recommendation for some. If, like me, you are a fan of more slow, simulation style naval warfare rather than action packed speedboats with explosive linings and machinegun-cannons then this is a good way to get your fix.But being entirely fair, I can not really recommend it for other things. The campaign is nice as a way to lend some kind of importance to the battles, but it does not really do much else. The in-battle AI is capable enough that it won't just roll over for you, but it is not amazing either, and the detail of the simulation is still far from perfect.Even though I like this game, and have probably spend way more time on it than I should, I can't really recommend it for anyone who is not a fan of the time period and simulation battles. It does decently well at the economy and trading parts of the campaign, but it is repetitive and you will find yourself speeding up time a lot until something interesting happens.

												This is an amusing game that makes me think of what you would get if you simplified Empire: Total War. Basically you set up cities in the new world, and trade with the home port to grow your economy, eventually waging war (either actual or economic) with the other colonial powers to conquer the americas. the mechanics are straightforward, every building and ship costs maintenance, and all the raw materials and finished good provide income. setup stable trade routes, bring colonists and soliders from the home port and you are set. the graphics are low, but its fun if you like this sort of gameplay.the controls are simple, and the menus make sense, once you get the hang of it its fun to repeat play because there are different ways to win.it is a cheap game though, so there are strange shortcuts that are missing, there are a lack of notifications about current events each turn, although there are popups they are usually reminders about failing a mission or a new missointhat can get annoying for some because well into the game there are a lot of things to keep track of, basically you can set up a trade route bringing ppl and goods in different directions (growing and defending settlements, satisfying needs) but the route you take and the time matter (especially once a good runs out) if you dont mind having to check every turn every single part of your empire because nothing lasts that long then this game is greati actually didnt care that i kept running things into the ground, i never won, but it was interesting to set up trade routes that eventually failed only to have someone declare war on you			",14,0,0,1,3,0,11

												I'm very grateful that I got this when it was on sale.The combat is awful since ships don't respond to controls, and the economy gets extremely repetitive.  Automatic trade routes don't really work either since the commodities are constantly shifting in availability, and the computer creates complex alliances which defy all notions of imperialism.  It gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ too where the computer will deliberately ally, then raid your smaller colonies to take them over without making a declaration of war.  If you take them back, then you implicitly declare war on the whole alliance.It's a great concept, but extremely poorly executed.			",213,64,2,65,48,2,102

												Personally I would recommend this game as a game that you would buy when it is on sale for very cheap.I will go with the pros and cons of this game as far as I personally experienced them.PROS:-a good commerce and civiliazation building game.-The interface is pretty cool.-Useful tips and hints as you first start out.-The Ship combat is fun.CONS: (there is a lot of them)-Poor tutorial (no tutorial for combat? really?)-Advisors can get pretty annoying at times.-The graphic textures are pretty fuzzy (I am not sure if it is my computer or the game itself)-The game can get pretty tedious and long.-Combat can get pretty confusing at first.-Trying to board other ships needs to be fixed.-buggy interface-the art portraits are rather lousy.Now I am not saying this is a terrible game. But I am saying that this is a good game that would buy when it goes on sale for $1.99. However, I do believe this game needs to be updated and it would be cool if they came out with a sequel.

												Many of the achievements seem to be broken and will not trigger. In addition, the naval combat is also extremely broken and buggy. The voice work is terrible. The visuals are average for 2010. The music is bland and repetitive. I think there might only be three tracks in the entire game, at most. Though probably only two. Set on an endless loop, good god. Finally, the commercial and administrative mechanics of the game are extremely primitive and superficial-- this game is, in essence, a poor man's Port Royale or Patrician, as regards the trade sims of this model.I don't know if I've missed anything, but this game is so uninspiring it's hardly a surprise that I don't especially care. Do not pay any more than $2.50 USD for this title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite being a bit enjoyable at its best, this maritime strategy game is scuttled by a very slow start and a lack of depth. Peculiar challenges and a good managerial dimension have to compare with a poorly detailed graphics and an excessive selling price.Strong naval combat is marred by shallow trade and town management.Instead of wrestling with rival nations, you'll tussle with unruly advisors in this naval trading sim.The lack of a tutorial is also not a great selling point.The Age of Discovery has enough excitement and intrigue to fill a hundred video games, just not this timid and repetitive strategy game.Overall, I'd give it a 4/10.A waste of money if you ask me.

												While slow to start off, the game unfolds a great world of opportunity in the New World. While focussing mainly on colonization and trade, this game offers also a pretty decent combat system. It's not a great game, because the interface isn't as clear and fluent as it could be, nor is the trade system presented in a understandable manner. However, when you look past those rough edges you can find a tiny gem that isn't like a lot of other bland games out there. 7/10			",126,40,6,39,59,0,77

Summary:Early game is enjoyable if you like looking at lots of numbers and stats. Then comes the second part of the game where the shortcomings of the game mechanics become clear.The good: The game is visually appealing. It still looks very good 5 years after release. There's a decent amount of tutorials to help you with the game. There is some replay value because the colony spots and resources are fairly randomized.The bad: The user interface is severely lacking: button hitboxes are pretty bad, important information like building queue is completely missing, ... Trade automation is a good concept, but is poorly implemented. Example 1: your colonies have a maximum population and you're supposed to ship in all the new people from your homeport. This can be automated. HOWEVER, if your colony is max size, the ship will just go back and forth instead of dropping off the colonists and removing the automated colonist loading line. Example 2: (the single most annoying thing you'll encounter) Your home port can only take 3000 units of every resource. If you have more than 5 colonies, then you'll have ships going back and forth fully loaded until some of the stock gets consumed in your home port.  There's a feature where colonies demand goods from your home country. However, at full size, the demand is usually higher than what the home country can produce. Having a steady supply line of these goods to all your colonies does absolutely nothing. There's still bugs. I've had traded goods (with other nations) not pop up in my warehouse, I've had a war ship fleet not chasing slower pirates (abandoning the follow move within the second), I've seen AI ships spazzing about, doing nothing, ... The AI is pretty bad. Mid-late game, half of them is bankrupt, while having as many ships as I do. Diplomacy is very simplistic and poorly implemented. You'll have AIs breaking pacts for no reason or becoming hostile for no reason. They also send you pointless trade offers. Selling me a physical boxed copy and then forcing me to install Steam??? I thought only SEGA, 2K and Bethesda were this bad at business.Things that could improve the game, but won't happen because it's old and abandoned: Add RPG-like events where you're in the governor perspective. There's so many possibilities here: natives, pirates, disease, enemy incursions, ... Don't limit colonies to one boring circle. Expand your territory inland with benefits and more encounters with natives. Overhaul the automated trade window to remove obsolete transport lines, like passenger transportation after the colony is full size and include quick options for shipment of all processed goods to the home port Expand diplomacy  Add smaller European nations to the diplomacy list to solve the problem of overstocked homeport warehouses.

Posted: July 27, 2016
												I've given this game a bit of time in campaign mode with the advisors.  I've been playing in difficult mode.  It's a very frustrating and poorly designed game and I don't recommend it.  Here's why.The Starting PhaseYou settle a colony or two.  Then trade back and forwards to your home port.  That's it for an hour or more.  Very slow.  Once you start producing second tier goods, you start producing more cash and can do more than just keep up with you advisors' demands.The AdvisorsThey regularly give you demands.  If you don't meet them, your reputation goes down - and in the end, you get replaced.  The demands are not well timed (eg. they will ask you to settle a colony when you are well below the minimum population threshhold for your next colony).  Sometimes they are impossible (eg. they ask you to send 50 soldiers to a colony that is less than 50 below the maximum limit).  Sometimes they are contradictory (eg. you are at war and one advisor demands you make peace and another demands you take a colony or destroy enemy ships).  As you progress and get your colonies going well with all the buildings they need, the advisors are left with fewer things to demand of you and so you get more of these impossible demands.BattlesYou can do these yourself or auto-resolve.  There is no tutorial.  Battles are complex and buggy.  Once a ship has been set to move in a direction, sometimes you can't change its direction - even if it means it hits a rock or another ship and sinks.  Often ships will file past the enemy without firing.  If a ship is set to attack the enemy, it will sometimes drift off and do it's own thing - drifting  far away if you let it.  Maybe there are solutions to these things.  There is no tutorial or explanation, so who knows - but I fiddled with most of the options and couldn't find anything.  Auto-resolve nearly always produces better results - particularly with attacks on forts.  The only downside with auto-resolve (apart from the fact that you are basically wasting half the game you just bought) is that you can't capture enmy ships.  But given the boarding function doesn't really work, that is not so bad.There is one fight that is always auto-resolve.  This is when you attack a town without a fort.  This requires repeated attacks.  You lose each one until the defending soldiers are reduced to zero.  Then you win the next battle.  The town defends just as well regardless of whether it has 5 soldiers or 1000, so this is really tedious and a huge waste of ships.WarYour advisors will ask you to do this, then hit you with repeated demands to make peace.  Even if you are winning the war, the other country will not make peace unless you pay them A LOT.  So you can get stuck in a long war.  Problem is even if you destroy the enemies ships, they survive, they don't get starved of cash, they don't go bankrupt.  Within the time it takes you to build two warships, they will have built 6 - soon they are picking off your convoys.  This affects your cashflow and once you drift into negative cash numbers, it's curtains (unlike your enemies).The EconomyThis works ok but is done so much better in other games.  Would have been nice to know that there is a tool to find the highest and lowest prices for goods.  Again, no tutorial, so I just stumbled upon this.  It would also be nice to be able to have standing orders to buy things and store them in the warehouses.  This would help deal with the constant demands from colonies for this or that good.  Otherwise - what is the point of the warehouses?  All goods seem to reduce in price and cost over time at a constant rate.  There is no fluctuation based on quantity available or demand.  So why would you put goods aside?  Basically, you want to make as much cash as possible, so you sell them as soon as you can.You can't trade with your other colonies for price reasons.  You can't trade with the other countries except through one off sales through the diplomacy system.Once you go into debt, that is basically the end.  You don't own the goods in your colonies.  You have to buy them (even though you pay for all the buildings that process the goods).  If you lack cash to buy them, you can't make a profit and you get killed by your fixed expenses (all those buildings you own that process the goods you then have to buy).  This can happen pretty quickly.  By 1540 your cashflow can fluctuate up to maybe 400,000 gold just based on the timing of your trade routes.  If you have a war and lose a convoy or two, it's game over  - and remember you can't make peace unless you have lots of cash and taking the other guy's colonies takes forever during which time, he will have twice the number of ships that you have.DifficultyI guess a lot of this is due to the difficulty level.  I have seen in these reviews that the normal level is a cakewalk - which is why I tried difficult.  Not so good if one level offers no challenge and the other is an exercise in frustration.WinningFrom what I can see - there is no such thing.  You play till 1650 and then it ends.  It's just a question of whether you can survive that many hours of frustration and monotony.  No thanks.Overall, this is the skeleton of a game with lots of things missing and lots of issues.  It won't be worth playing until a lot more DLC is issued - and even then, not sure I would trust them given my experience thus far.			",14,14,0,13,6,0,12

												This game had great potential as a both a sea battle and 4X strategy game during its release time, but the complexity fell short.The screenshots are somewhat misreprentative of the gameplay, only because control is somewhat limited.Instead of exciting sea battles, it is more of a ponderous game of waiting and manual control of having to fight every battle yourself in order to save your convoys.The AI is just too stupid to do it themselves.Trade routes and major features just does not have the depth of even Alpha Centauri or Emporer - Rise of the Middle Kingdoms.The only real bonus is the the added ""pirate features"" with hiring privateers.If you want an even more simplified version of the game, the entire Paradox Interactive lineup of the ""East India Company"" can be bought for around $20.

												Bought the game at full price not worth it. As usual for Paradox production of the past few years there is little dept.Game become repetitive very quickly and the battles are not even up to the empire total war naval battle.Good base for a Beta but there are a lot more titles out there which deliver a better game experience.

												Declared war on Spain after conquering their colonies even though I had no chance of winning. Then, became a corrupt French general and wasted all my colonies' budgets on booze and ships. Spain and their ally Portugal came back and killed me along with my colonies. 10/10 would♥♥♥♥♥♥off Spain again. But honestly it's a good game but it might not be the game for everyone.

												I love Paradox and strategy games but this one was just missing alot of basic functionality... It felt really slow to get started and going.. I felt like the ship interactions with ports and towns was counter-intuitive.. forcing me to select the town, instead of the ship/fleet... and then I just up and quit when I realized you couldn't figure out who owned all the colonies around you.. no colour coding.. no name.. and no tiny little flag above the settlement.. just a green, white or red halo depending upon their relationship with you.  Needs a serious over-haul.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its like Colonization in real-time, but without different professions and without the possibility to settle in the inland. Its fun, but not a real challenge against the AI, also in the later game. I recommend the pirate dlc for a new experience having own pirate ships for hunting freighters under the flag of the outlaws.. ^^			",915,344,38,177,134,7,240

												this game is not great, in fact it hard to play. first it seem easy then you go economic downfall in 20 minutes which doesn't explain about buy & sell oh plus you have to pay your own commodities from the colonies that is your instead workers just put them in your Warehouse for free (while being payed for work) then sell them to homeland (Europe) naval battles may be pretty but in the game it not much even the controls are difficult. it not easy which is true in real Life Governor job but it don't just be simple. if you into this lifestyle as I am then try Port Royale 3, it similur to this game but more easy simple except long term as Governor if you own an island while being Richest merchant and total war empire for Military war and naval battles so this game, I give it 2 in half out of 5 (2,5)			",26,9,0,5,10,0,18

												It's not 100% fun, but gets boring after a while.Once you manage to raise a fleet of 3 squadrons.. with 2 of them being full galleons and the last one either barque and/or galleons as well, then you can raise hell and capture all ports.But playing the game till after the 1600s never happened.. by the time it was 1535 i took the entire map.. so you can imagine how boring it will be to wait till 1600 or even 1650 for new ships.. unless you play on harder difficulty.. but i wouldn't recommend it since the mechanics are structured and difficulty will only mean unfair advantage rather than intelligent enemy AI.
