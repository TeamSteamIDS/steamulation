												I really do love this game, the way you have to budget your money and buy more ships to trade more goods over time to make more money and eventually conquer India.  The Politics between Companies is interesting along with dealing with pirates.   Pirate hunting can be costly but the rewards are great, and be careful what you do as far as conquering India, because monopolizing one recourse can cause other companies to join forces against you.  The ship to ship combat is fun, with the abilities experienced Admirals gain over time and the different kinds of ships.  I like how buying Marines actually helps in combat is they fire muskets at other ships and are extremely useful during a boarding.  A gem of a game for anyone who likes RTS Naval combat, and the direct control you can take of a single ship is very interesting and well done as well.  All and all, a great game that for the $10 Dollars is well worth it.  Although, I do advise paying the $15 dollars to get it with all the DLC as well.  The pirate DLC is a blast, and Privateering as very mission based which is interesting as well, and the battle of the Trafalgar is a great challenge for all who think themselves up to it.  It does have some issues as it is a bit old, but downloading some older software for drivers fixes this in under 10 minutes, and is worth the trouble, but is a drawback, for that I give this game a 7.5 - 8/10.  Fantastic.			",203,39,4,18,25,0,42

												I am having a lot of fun with this game. If you enjoy strategy and some challenge it is a great game. A few small issues with sound which isn't a big deal, the tutorial/voice isn't very loud and you have to adjust the volume a bit. Other than that I highly recommend this game for it's price. Bought it on sale and even if I paid the $9.99 I would feel it was worth it. The ship battles are fun and you can grow your fleet by capturing other vessels or sell the cargo if any and the ships you capture if you choose. A little bit of getting used to the user interface, but with the option to play with tips on or off is a big help. Really good game.			",82,15,0,11,6,0,3

												This game is quite buggy. Ever so often you are offered a mission to earn some ""pounds"" by way of missions. They spawn randomly and you can either decline them, as I would recommend, or accept them. If you accept the mission, you are given a short time frame. Far too short. Some missions didn't state a time frame, but failed me as I was trying to prepare for the mission.The missions do not take in account that you are probably doing other things with your boats. I had a boat that just bought some goods from India and was on it's way back to the port. The mission was for me to buy a large amount of goods that could be found in Africa, so I accepted. The mission gave me one year to do this mission. By the time my boat had arrived back in port to unload the goods from India my mission had failed.I couldn't unload the items from India to any location because I would have lost money. It's very limiting.The game requires you to have your boat stop at ports, but allows ports to be taken over. This prevents you from using the ports to move your ships, less they take damage.I find it weird that everyone uses, ""Pounds"" as currency. I played as the Holy Roman Empire and I doubt they used the British pound, although I could be mistaken. This seems like a mis chance of having a bit more complex system of currency.The game is rather easy. When buying goods at home, you can nearly always sell them for a decent price in Africa, or a outstanding price in India. The opposite is true. In Africa most of the goods can be sold for a decent price in home port. India's goods are sold at extreme profits in home port. The game even tells you how much you would profit if you bought a good outside of home port and sold it back to home port.This causes the game to be just, Buy stuff at home port, and sell them in India, allowing you to buy items in India and selling them at home port. Back and forth, ever so slowly. The game plays so slow. It gives you five times speeds. 0.5 Watching grass grow. 1 Lord of the Rings trilogy marathon. 2 A trip to the amusement park. 3 The time it took you to walk to the mall. And number 4 Why isn't this speed the first number?The battles are worse. The ships move so slowly as well. I had been heading towards a small island desperately holding the d key to turn the ship. Instead it slowly turned enough to still ram into the island, which caused damage to the ship and it sunk. Let's just say I wouldn't want to captain these ships.I understand that ships are realistically slow, but I am playing a video game. I want it to be exciting. A bit daring. I don't want to be slowly firing my slow recharge cannons, notice that I am headed towards danger and spend a good minute trying to turn the boat without success.I just want to have fun.With a repetitive game play, and just an over all slow clucky feel. I would not recommend this game.			",70,13,0,28,45,0,21

												Lots of seafaring fun with all of it's parts.  Like a lot of games it can be exasperating at times especially when your maxed out fleet loses to a wimpy faction.  Not a whole lot of differences no matter what level you play at except on Easy you don't have to worry that a port won't buy your cargo or that your homeport won't like any of their cargo.There are 2 methods of combat.  You can control all your ships in a high resolution graphic war or use Autoresolve that determines the winner.   At first I used the graphic option but found that controling 5 warships was a problem, especially since more often than not your surrounded by islands that will rip ships apart and the ships are not capable of sharp turns.  The enemy of course is on the seaward side of the islands.  Additionally your ships will not fire near as often as the enemy.  If you put all the ships on auto except the flagship they will run right into an island and sink.The skill your Captains receive for destroying enemy ships are pretty much useless.  They can still be womped by a wimpy enemy and they will sooner or later.The Galleon is a bit over rated in the game.  It is a slow clumbersome ship more suited for cargo but the game lists it as a war ship.  Back in those days a Scooner captained by an experienced captain could defeat one.  The trick was to sail around behind them and hit them from behind.  Another trick was to watch for the flash of the Galleon's cannon.  Unlike shells of today it took a while for the cannon balls to reach you.  You knew that the Galleon would be leading his target so a quick turn to the port or starboard would cause a miss.  You didn't want to get hit by them even once!When the Frigate came out most nations switched to it because it was faster and more manuverable that a Galleon.Enuf of the history lesson, lol.  It's a fun game if you like strategy sea wars.			",20,3,0,4,20,0,8

												Don't believe all the negative hype about this game. While the game does increase in difficulty rather sharply (What Paradox Interactive game doesn't...?), It's a solid trade sim. The diplomacy system is well fleshed out and the tactics one must employ to slow the devlopment of an opponents growth are fresh and varied. I don't know why everyone complains of save corruption or freezing... In 10 hours of play, I haven't experienced the slightest graphics issue. However, I can see the ship battles dropping Framerate for lesser computers.All in all, not a bad game. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I own this game. Right NOW I can't find any of those games in my library. I thought they would always be visible, but I don't see them in any of my folders. I remember really enjoying and getting into this game, and intrigued by the battles ... but then at some point soon in every game it would start crashing after battles and I could never progress beyond a very short beginning. Never close enough to really get to know it intimately. Very heart-breaking. Such an ""almost lover"". ""What could have been"". If only we had been fated differently in this life, this game and I.

												Its good to see a naval game thats not based on pirates; there is so much potential for games based on colonial powers/navies. The trading aspect is a little difficult to get used to early in the game, but its very cool once you get a foothold. The naval combat is realistic and well-paced, and the ship types accurately depict their 17th and 18th century counterparts. All things considered, East India Company is a very nice game.
