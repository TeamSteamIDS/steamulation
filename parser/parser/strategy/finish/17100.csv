												Children of the Nile is the more modern version of the old citybuilders like Pharaoh And Zeus, allowing you to build a city in ancient Egypt. Some of the more modern things are, aside from the obvious graphics being different, that you no longer need to worry about intersections sending your supply and maintenance people entirely the wrong direction. You can now actually focus on building a city, rather than having to puzzle out the most efficient way to place buildings without them collapsing, catching fire, and starving because the food vendor doesn't show up there.Citizens in your city are in a class society. From top to bottom, they are the pharaoh. That is you, and your family. You have a palace, and your family goes out to collect any sort of material, be it luxury goods or a humble pot to store things in. You are the state. All food belonging to the city also belongs to you, but you will always have a nice supply of food stored away in your palace. Pharaoh gets first pick, and a percentage of all food farmed in taxes. Just below you are the nobles, who live in large houses and get their income from the farmers under them, and in order to support a large farming population, you will need nobles to guide them.Under the nobles are the educated elite. Priests, scribes, overseers, and commanders of the military. They have similar demands as nobles in terms of luxuries, but they are paid by the government for their services. Only the sons of nobles and luxury shopkeepers qualify for education. These are the doctors, the administration, and the tax collectors. Because nobles will try to dodge paying taxes, a scribe can catalogue how many fields have been sown so that you know exactly how much belongs to Pharaoh.Under them still, the middle class. Entertainers and shopkeepers. These earn their bread through their services and the goods they sell. Simple, but neccesary for society to function.Below them, the peasantry. Farmers and servants. The farmers work the land and earn enough food to last until next harvest in doing so, and the servants do the shopping for nobles and collect resources for luxury shopkeepers - So they don't have to mingle with the common folk.Separate from them all are government workers. They fit somewhere between the middle class and peasantry, and are paid generously by Pharaoh's bread. They are the brickmakers, the construction workers for bigger buildings(Small buildings like a servant's shack are made by the servants themselves), and anything else government wants from a papyrus maker up to the military.If at any time your system fails and the people are without food, they will leave their jobs to scavenge for it. Dates, pomegranades, fish and so on are plentiful, so you need not fear you'll ruin your city and have a ghost town.The game starts slow every map, as you have 10 bricks(Enough for one baker, brickmakers huts don't need bricks), and only one educated person in your city at the start. So you will want to build a school and several brickmakers more to ensure you can keep growing. Before you know it, you've spend several hours building. There is no immigration either, from what I can find. You start the map with 200-300 citizens living in huts, scavenging off the land. After that, children will be your main population growth. This becomes an issue when you want a big military, as military men don't get married - They live in their barracks-tent with two other men.Some things that are bad, there are a lot of shrines out there that will take a bit to figure out which goes where and which are popular - If you even have room for them. Sometimes your citizens or a merchant may get stuck on a corner, and sometimes you may find your labourers can't figure out which limestone block they want to pull, and manage to fail to move any of them. In the end, it's still a pretty and somewhat relaxing game where you can spend hours getting your city just right, and then decide to change it up again because you have a new idea. Cosmetic things like gardens, plazas and trees are free to place too, so you can make it look good without having to worry about your workers spending ages watering the plants and not farming.Worth grabbing it if you like citybuilding, it's good at what it does			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An absolute gem. I pride myself in digging up golden PC titles that receive little fanfare, and this game is surely one of those. As an ancient Egyptian simulation, this game is a unique city-simulation concept with excellent execution and historical accuracy. The mechanics are distinct, with the three ""Seasons"" revolving entirely upon the flooding of the Nile. The only currency is the only one that truly mattered in the ancient world; food.Like Ancient Egypt, religion plays a key role in the game, with a rich and diverse pantheon of true-to-life Egyptian Gods and Goddesses to be honoured by Temples and Shrines. Every person in your settlement is represented in the game and has unique needs, most notably religious needs. Soldiers, shop-keepers, peasants and elites all demand an opportunity to pray to the Gods and Goddesses which best represent their needs, while everyone will want to worship Amun, Osiris and Hathor; the Universal deities whose festivals were paramount to most Egyptian cultures.Of course, you will be building an awful lot of pyramids, obelisks and steles to immortalize yourself, mighty Pharaoh, and cement the legacy of your lineage. Throw in a flavourful soundtrack and a diverse array of scenarios and missions and you have the best $2 I have ever spent on steam. I must buy for any city-building lover, Egyptophile or classic game collector.			",161,37,1,54,34,0,43

												CotN is a beautiful city-building game with a slight twist -- instead of ""walkers"" who go out and follow roads around town to distrubute their wares, most of your people take time out to run to the market when they need things (you can follow the individuals out, going through their day, and it's kind of entertaining in itself).   The game itself is pretty laid back and peaceful feeling, and the music is quite nice, too.  My one complaint would be that sometimes, when you select a person roaming around town, they say something utterly anachronistic and stupid, and I find that detracts from the overall mood of the game.  Turn that off, and you're golden.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an old game and I played it when it first came out.  You play in ancient Egypt as a Pharaoh leading his/her people to economic and military supremacy.  If you can keep your people well feed, healthy and happy you will be successful.  There are some glitches in the game I have had a few problems but nothing serious just annoying.  There have been a couple of additions such as the brickyard which are helpful and some new decorations since I first played it.If you enjoy city building you might want to try this one.  You can also do some retexturing of buildings, plazas, costumes.  I enjoy doing that and perking up the city a little bit. The game can be played at various speeds to suit your preferences.

												First off, Children of the Nile isn't really a bad game - but it's tough for me not to compare it with other historical city builders, even those a decade older - in particular Pharaoh, Zeus and Caesar III / IV. Graphically, CotN is quite solid - it looks pretty, plenty of resolution choices for an older title. Gameplay-wise, roads, plazas and all decorative items are free, so you can grid and beautify your city from the get-go. Even on the small maps, you have plenty of room to build. Unlike the other city builders, there is no strict road attachment requirement either, and the open-world pathfinding works well. Where CotN suffers terribly, however, is on challenge factor and pace.The gameplay is slow. Excruciatingly slow. During play, virtually nothing happens that you need to cope with reactively. While there is trade with other cities, each and every site has all the basic resources to thrive alone. Once you know the build order, there's no need to deviate from it, ever. City guards and walls are utterly useless for the cost in bricks and manpower - luckily, you don't need them on any map, ever.I've just finished the campaigns, and each and every map boiled down to this; build the basic city of peasant shacks, noble homes and shops, copy-pasted from previous map. Wait for a harvest. Block out into brickworks and basic infrastructure. Wait two harvests. Expand. Wait more harvests. Begin farming the 'special' resource you need to win that map (army, navy, monuments, imports, etc). Wait a huge amount of harvests. Win the map.I wish I was joking, but my playthrough boiled down to each hour being five minutes of city-building, fifty-five minutes of waiting. I read through several books while I ""played"" this game at maximum speed; there was no need to pay attention at all, not even the 'disasters' that hit are worth any adjustment - mostly because by the time they happen, or the interface tells you people are unhappy, it's already too late to do anything about it save let it ride itself out, be it disease, hunger or discontent.Compared to Pharaoh, where each map was distinctly different and had different challenges based on which resources you had available, what you could import/export and what monuments you could build, Children of the Nile repeats the same tedious thing on every map, and at the same time offers no challenge whatsoever save waiting, and waiting some more. Slow pace is all well and good, especially in a city builder - but Children of the Nile is positively glacial compared to all the other city builders Impressions/Tilted Mill ever produced, and that absolutely kills it as a game.I enjoyed the books I read while the game run. I did not enjoy 'playing' this game. Again, it's not bad or broken - it's just incredibly tedious. For that, I cannot recommend it - save if you want an easy 100% achievements game. All you need is a ton of patience and a few good books. I'd still recommend Pharaoh / Zeus / Casesar III/IV over this one any day, as a game to play and enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NOTE: Looking for the Caesar series, what about Zeus? gog.com ->> http://www.gog.com/game/caesar_3 has it ! :D:Dhttp://www.gog.com/support/website_help/what_is_gog_com gog.com is basically a digital distribution site just like Steam that sells classic games deemed ""the best games ever made"" and they are DRM free.Children of the Nile: Enhanced Edition striked me fairly well, it's a city builder set and centered around ancient Egypt. There were three main reasons why I like this game, 1) the setting is rarely covered, most city builders are focused more on modern architecture. 2) The attention to detail and novel feature of Children of the Nile, and that's it has a very unique economic system -- a food based economic system. Talk about realism, you don't get close to re-living the Egyptian society than paying your government workers food. Children of the Nile also has a strong class system, also representing ancient Egypts strong class society, relying on every member to be in his/her place from peasant, middle class, and noble. How you gain and manage each of these classes is unique, but the game ensures that the player knows that in order to manage more peasants/farmers, you need plenty of nobles. Lastly, 3) the quality of 2006 game is very impressive. Plenty of resolution support and a lot of graphics and audio options, including some for the interface and gameplay. I haven't experienced any crashes or bugs either. The content advertised through the trailer, screenshot, and Steam product store is as advertised, and the voice acting and audio description before a mission is top notch. The graphics and attention to certain Egyptian architectural structures is very pleasing. The music only adds to the immersion and there's plenty of resources and freedom to build your city uniquely to your liking. Decorations are free so you can start planning the layout of your city without much hassle or delay. There's even in-game info, help menu that will explain what the building does and who works it if you are new. There's plenty of missions and content for the price, therefore, it very well worth base price. The developers know it's a great deal too because the game didn't get a price cut during the holiday sale. Even if you played SimCity[4], Tropico, Grand Ages Rome, Anno 2070, Dawn of Discovery, Stronghold, Zeus, Caesar or any other city builder, you'll still get a kick out of this game. It's amazing, it feels original and is very entertaining. Children of the Nile will be perfect for you especially if you are looking for a city builder set in an archaic setting of a former time. Take a look at other reviews as well, lots of other players already have phenominal amounts of hours racked.That sums up my review, if a developer reads this, I hope you guys will be able to bring the Caesar games to Steam, and be able to finish Medieval Mayor with enough support if the series sells well on Steam. Best of luck, your games are amazing, thank you for creating such memorable gems. You guys will always hold the place of the best city builders in the genre. Thanks for reading, if you think you might like this game pick it up -- support these developers, it's way better than the sorry rip-off excuse early access/DLC scams nowadays..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am really into this game.  It fits into a very small niche of citybuilders, has mechanics that don't restrict npcs to road access, and puts massive monuments into the perspective of realistic, long-term projects.  A huge annoyance in the beginning was figuring out how the hell it works, since the tutorials lay it out but the amount of gods just gets ridiculous.Pros:good camera controls allow for essentially any perspectivenot a road-connectivity approach to citybuildersThe prestige meter adds a fun side-goal to merely completing a citycons:can glitch out and exit without warning, or some computers can't run it at allthe worship demands of the citizens are extremely difficult to meetfrickin priestsBuy it on sale.  Don't buy it if you're trying to get achievements, because they'd be easy to get if steam would just fork them over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty fun game once you figure out the mechanics. Not quite like its predecessors Caesar/Pharaoh/Zeus/Emperor. Pros: 3D world which can allow for panoramic views, more interaction with the surrounding world, more focus on city building and managing rather than satisfying objectives quickly, resolution to challenges in the city are discovered by you rather than told how to fix those problems from advisors (for those who like something more engaging), all missions are treated nearly like a sandbox. Pretty much, you can build 100 pyramids if the map can hold it.Cons: Sometimes the game can crash unexpectedly, not many missions in general campaign, not much historical/mythological context is given with missions as in the predecessors (found them to be enlightening and neat).

												There are plenty of historical city-builders, but only two set in ancient Egypt that I know of. One is Pharaoh, an off-shoot of the classic Caesar series, and this is the other. Now over a decade old, Children of the Nile gave players the freedom to build great cities and earn prestige on vast maps, with a detailed citizen simulation that rivaled that of the Tropico series. It may be showing its age, but there's plenty more reasons to take a look at it besides it being nearly the only game in town.In Children of the Nile, you are Pharaoh, absolute ruler of your little patch of desert. From your palace you order the construction of homes and shops, direct the tasks of your citizens, and seek to raise your own prestige. That first point turns out to be blessedly easier than in most city-builders, because this game has a distinct lack of currency or building materials. Most homes are completely free to grant space to, and you need only wait for the residents to move in from whatever uncivilized village they've been grubbing around in. Basic shops and services are also free, and any key buildings beyond that require only a small amount of bricks to erect.Right from the get-go, then, you are completely open to build and expand as you see fit. There ARE resources, of course, but the important ones are very easy to keep track of. Your most basic resource is food, which feeds your people and is used in your civic buildings as a sort of currency. The peasant class farms food for you automatically, but are limited in number by how many nobles you have. And your nobles are limited only by your ability to provide them services, most of which cost you additional food. This simple balance keeps the game on a steady pace of expansion, where you're never really limited by resources and would really have to go out of your way to foul up.As you expand you'll start to run across the more granular resources, everything from papayrus reeds to obsidian quarries. Your shops need access to raw materials to make goods, and the most complex construction projects like statues and pyramids require special stone. As I mentioned, Children of the Nile operates much like Tropico where each citizen is modeled and must go about their day in real-time. This could threaten to cause bottlenecks and catastrophic failures as it does in the earlier Tropicos, but here your citizens have generous ranges of travel and stay focused on their tasks. You'll still run into some folks too busy or lazy to go pray or shop, but the consequences of irritating your citizens is very mild and usually easily rectified.There are dozens of buildings and services to construct, from temples to courts to tombs, and in most scenarios you'll need to make the most of all of them. Key to the progression systems is Prestige, a measure of how respected your Pharaoh is. Prestige is needed to recruit more educated workers, key positions like priests and overseers, and is earned by constructing grand buildings and decorations, winning military victories, and other exploits. Prestige can also degrade over time and you lose some when your Pharaoh passes on, so it's an element that requires constant attention. Usually the paths to earning Prestige in a given scenario are obvious, and the rest of the game is relaxed enough that you'll have plenty of time to focus on your fortune and glory.I did mention military victories and other exploits, because Children of the Nile is not content to give you just one plot of land to lord over. You also have a world map that shows all of Egypt and the surrounding lands, with points of interest marked. For a cost of food, envoys, and other resources, you can open new trade routes, set up labor camps for resources not found on your map (very useful for the limestone needed for pyramids), and attack barbarian encampments. Combat on the world map requires no interaction, you just send troops like resources, but in harder scenarios you may be attacked and will need to raise and outfit an army. It's a pretty sizable undertaking but again there's no real combat to speak of, your soldiers automatically seek out and destroy invaders.You'll find plenty to do in each of the game's 15 scenarios, for the maps are enormous and offer multiple locations that would suit a city. Resources are also scattered liberally so you're never really tied to a single spot except in the case of quarries. All of this is rendered in some chunky but serviceable 3D, complete with shadows and rising Nile waters, but the graphics are really where the game shows its age. Your cities can easily grow into huge, sprawling affairs that are hard to parse without the modern accoutrements of depth of field and fluid camera controls. The sound design still holds up at least, with plenty of quaint sound effects and little dialogue quips from your citizens. As long as the dated graphics don't throw you off this is a fantastically interesting and chill builder that's easy to get into and hard to put down.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Note: I have previously played a non-steam version therefore playtime hours are not accurate.A truly great city-building game, from the makers of jewels like Caesar and Pharaoh, this game has it all. It has good, well thought out gameplay elements and is a must for anyone who has an interest in Ancient Egypt.I love the freedom that your citizens have, compared to previous city-building games from the same makers, where they were restricted to walking on roads and needed to be guided with roadblocks. Observing your citizens do their daily routine is enjoyable.The interface is great and informative, and the tutorial explains things nicely. You have a good amount of freedom in building and positioning, and it feels very natural. There is no penalty for placing certain buildings near others, which is great, I always disliked having to juggle around the placement location.The prestige system is a clever feature, where the game gauges your dynasty by their deeds, such as conquering enemies cities then building monuments to commemorate the victory, explore the world, building statues and of course making tombs like the humble mastaba to the iconic pyramid.My playthrough was done on normal difficulty and the objectives were reasonable, but you cannot lose. Citizens may protest or leave your city, but you can recover from that. Enemy raiders will take your citizens belongings making them unhappy, but they wont destroy any building.On the bad side, sometimes your citizens pathfinding gets glitchy, but its nothing gamebreaking. In one scenario you must build the greatest pyramid possible, even with 3 or 4 labour teams it took so long that it became boring. For people who care about achievements: there are achievements for concluding each scenario on the campaign, and I didnt get it when I completed two of them.Overall this is a great game and I highly recommend it.

												So it crashes at regular intervals. It lags occasionally when a city gets really big, aside from lagging at every autosave. The AI can be infuriating at times: If you like micromanaging, be prepared to sit back and pull your hair at your laborers who will go across the Nile and over 2 mountains to haul limestone, while an overseer stands by himself overseeing no one in a site right next to their houses. Transporting heavy loads, like statues and obelisks across the Nile is also a well known problem, annoyingly time consuming at best, unsolvable at worse (unless you're willing to delve into the editor). It shows its age in a lot of ways, the graphics included, though they still hold their own fine enough.And now that you have all that information, just look at the time I've sunk in this game. It's just a great city builder. Flawed but great. The setting is interesting, the concepts are the same old, yet refreshingly different. It doesn't have an insane depth of strategy (it may even feel a bit simplified compared to other similar games), yet it feels satisfying. Most of the strategy involved is focused in where you build and what you prioritize, which needs to ignore and which to focus on, so really, when to build what where. There is enough you need to balance for it to stay challenging, between food cultivating, prestige maintaining, religious needs and building pyramids. There's also some nice extra bits of historical info hidden away in the interface if you want to learn something new. The game is easy enough to pick up if you play the tutorials, which are ok: basically playable, hand-holding, mini versions of the game - I felt I was playing, not reading a tutorial. Even so, looking up some of the details on how the AI works will help you understand the mechanics better. There are huge forums with tons of info, player maps and walkthroughs available online which can help with that. Also worthy of mention, I found the interface easy to use and perfectly adequate, which I think is very very important in a city builder.Should you buy? Yes. Provided you understand that this is a game released in 2008 that has its share of small annoyances, if you like leisurely paced city builders this is still a solid game that hits many marks.

												This game is ridiculously fun, BUT I've hit a glitch in the first scenario that halts progress immediately forever. My laborers get stuck trying to haul granite, so I can't build anything that needs to be quarried. According to google, plenty of people have had this problem, but no one's mentioned a fix. Since the game is 10 years old, I don't have much hope for a patch. This makes me so sad because I really like it otherwise. Still recommend it, becuase not everone has this problem.

												A very refreshing city building game. Slow pace, your gameplay is dependant on the current season. You will learn to love the harvest season! There is no money in Children of the Nile, food is the common currency. You want new government services, labourers for your monuments or an army? Well, nourish them, and hope that the Nile flood will be generous so that noone has to to starve. User Interface is well designed, you will always easily see if your city is running well or if problems are arising.There are no major gameplay issues. The military part of the game is not that bright, as is often the case with this kind of games.It is not all too difficult to maintain a well managed city if you are used to the genre, but beware of the tremendous building times for even modest pyramids. Maintaining trade with other cities is also a must (you will rarely have all useful resources available on your city map), and can be quite costly. Graphics are old but won't hurt your eyes, the Egypt setting is well rendered. Gazing at the Nile and the papyrus rushes while your people are working to gather resources is a pleasure.

												This game is good once you get the hang of it. Things aren't abstracted at all, so everyone in your town is a real guy with a house and job which you'll have to carefully build and manage but not in a boring way. It's hard to get into it but once you get the idea it's pretty fun. It reminds me of Banished, except this game feels less pointless since you can work towards building cool stuff like pyramids. You can do a lot of decoration and fine tuning which I like.			",80,11,0,6,20,0,11

												I've not played it nearly as much as I should have, but it's a wonderful, very personal city builder.  It operates on a relatively small scale that helps you understand the settlement's workings without a barrage of information and clutter, but also puts you in touch with your little Egyptian dudes.  I'm no expert on the genre, but I've never gotten a better sense of a living, breathing place than I have in Children of the Nile.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Caesar3-style build-grow-explore gameplay, but on a MUCH BIGGER scale. Challenging scenarios in campaign mode ranging from ""easy"" to ""hard"" so you can first practice and then go to tougher terrain after the first playthrough. Do not get confused by these ratings, though, because even the easy campaigns can get pretty messy and challenging at times, not taking any prisoners. The game has quite a good and quick learning curve. In fact, the first scenario should teach ou basically everything you need about the basics. If you get the basics right especially in the beginning of scenarios, the game is more about strategy than micromanagement. If you get it wrong, you will be lost in fixing all that you messed up; better to start over in that case if I'm honest.The game provides hours and hours of gameplay, building, growing and exploring/connecting to the world outside your immediately designated scenario area. You can open trade routes, cooperate with friendly cities, fend off enemies and remotely lay siege to your enemies while supplying all your expeditions with resources you manage to get together (or not). Though not really for complete beginners, I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good challenge in building strategy games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Orginally thought this was 'Children of Denial', which was the new AAA FPS MMORPG that is supposed to be the most realistic modern war simulator today and featured gameplay starting when the character was 13, old enough to hold an AK.. .. but it's not.. this is a City-esque management game about ancient egypt.. and it's pretty darned good at doing that... I don't know if it's a direct sequel, or just inspirated by the old 'Pharoh' series, but it's very similar, and updated version of that. Gfx ♥♥♥♥♥s need not apply here though.. it was good for the year it came out, but not up to modern 2012 standards by far.. but City-mgmt games aren't usually about the graphics... :] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The greater focus of this game is steadily progressing your various wealth classes to bigger and better productivity. The end goal of most of the scenerios is having enough excess good to make deals with your neighbors, some of which are readily available, some of which require you to plan out long-range mining camps.All done at a relatively low-key, relaxing pace.

Once you get a feel for the sequence and quantity of what you need to build, it goes smoothly with the population mostly happy. Don't build too much too fast. I never did see a benefit for having scribes cause I never used them and it didn't seem to affect the gameplay. It is also great to watch that great pyramid rise!!!			",15,7,0,15,11,0,11

												Children of the Nile is a game that encompasses much of what's wrong with the city builder genre these days. It simplifies things that shouldn't be simplified and turns concepts abstract that really needs to be spelled out.The abstract resource gathering system and the almost absent transportation system makes learning how to play the game entirely trial and error. And that just doesn't work in this genre.Graphically the game is very poor and you'll often find yourself having to zoom in as far as you can to find out what your people are doing and often just to select them.The games only positive is that there really aren't that much competition in the city builder genre so if you're a fan, you really don't have much of an option other than to try out Children of the Nile.A truly mediocre game and not really worth your money.

No one is buying goods, with no reason to why they are not. I have shops coming out from my behind, all fully stock. I have plenty of food, till my nobles start to refuse to buy goods, then start leaving, which then takes away my farmers, which then takes away from the rest of my society. I can't seem to find any useful information about the game online or have the ability to force my citizens into action. I'm on the verge of quitting the game. Would not recommend to anyone.

												I like this game because it's a civilization simulator where you don't have to fight other dudes.			",118,20,6,22,20,2,17

												Ugh, what a pain it is to get anything done in this game. No one is ever satisfied.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The concept is nice, I like how the people all interact with each other, and how all the gods are incorporated.  However, it's TOO much.  You have way too much going on at once, and there's just no way to keep everyone happy (especially with the gods).  And once you do get a shrine for all the gods, now it's too far away for everyone and it's a mess.  And why build paths when they aren't even used?  I love city builders, but this one is terrible.

												An excellent game to remind us of the wonders of an earlier game: Pharaoh.As an ancient historian I think this game is rather excellent. The history is there, I like all of the features of the game, and the way the town has to be made is logical. The gathering of resources could not have been done any more correctly and I really like making all these pyramids for no good reason at all!I like the graphics, the music (though I turned it off in favour of my own music), and the whole mechanics of the game.I did not however, like the many bugs present in the game. People get stuck between buildings trying to go past them, which is VERY annoying, sometimes the workers just dont do what you want them to do; for example I wanted to store basalt for a later project and it turned out that I can only mine basalt if Im going to immediately use it. wth.But conclusively, I recommend this game, its great fun and has a relatively good tutorial which can be followed, not to mention all the awesome decorations you can put up ^_^			",144,23,5,25,18,0,30

												Good game, reminiscent of Pharoah but this one centers on food not money as a resource.Only downside is how short the campaign is. There are 3 maps on evey stage to choose from, I think 5 stages in a campaign, there is a map editor however but I am yet to try it.			",78,6,1,11,25,1,21

												I absoloutely loved this game when I was younger, as my sister bought it for me back in 2008, and this game still is the only city-building game that's set in Ancient Times that I STILL play, and even though the graphics aren't mindblowing anymore, It's still one of my favourite games! :3			",25,4,1,0,4,0,0

												quite a fun city sim game set in ancient egypt - there are a few tricks that require some online research in order to play succesfully.			",11,7,0,3,11,0,13

												This game is beautiful. It isn't quite as quick or easy to understand as Sierra's Pharoah, but it is enjoyable. I played it off media for a long time until it became available in Steam. Don't fear it. =]			",187,110,7,15,19,0,17

												I've bought this game three separate times. I still play it from time to time after all these years - there's still something new about each game, oddly enough.			",44,15,0,18,13,0,35

												Excellent game but controls can be difficult to find as there are a few. A better sandbox/relaxed mode would be nice too. I still prefer 'Pharoah' and the Cleopatra expansion to the Nile. But playability is 8/10, graphics are 7/10, storyline 7/10.I would recommend this game if you like Egyptian strategy games.			",25,37,0,10,30,0,12

												Tilted Mill Entertainment was born out of the ashes of Impressions Games and Children of the Nile is similar to their classic city building games Caesar, Zeus and Pharaoh but doesn't play exactly the same way. The basic structure of the game is the same but the city buildings and dynamics are altered so that you have to micromanage a bit more. But if you enjoy these games, you enjoy micromanaging cities so it's not a negative aspect.The production values have taken a hit from the days of Impressions Games, but that's just an unfortunate side effect of having less money for development. This is a very solid city building sim.			",188,70,1,89,21,0,35
