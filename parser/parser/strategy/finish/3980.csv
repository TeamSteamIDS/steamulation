												A strategic level-based city building simulator in the vein of the Caesar/Pharoah series of old. It's easy to understand but operates slightly differently from how most others do (where road access between buildings is necessary for benefits), instead opting for a direct ""distance"" approach in order for benefits to convey. Because of this, some strategies may seem non-intuitive at first to folks who are experienced in the genre.It's competent, and fun - not the best example of the genre, but a good way to spend some time if you're into this type of game.

												I enjoy city builders, and I enjoy Civilization, so this one was very exciting for me. It's really more of a city builder than a Civilization game, though. You can research technologies to unlock new buildings, but it stays in one era (of course), and it has wonders you may build. That's about all for the similarties between Civ and CivCity. The campaign does a good job of easing you into building a city, introducing you to new buildings little by little. I kept expecting it to end, but it ended up being a fairly deep game, the ending having quite a lot of buildings and rescources to manage. I had a lot of fun, especially at the end when I had to make my city pretty with gardens and statues in order to win the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game because it reminded me of Pharaoh and Master of Olympus:Zeus, which I spent plenty of hours on when I was younger. I wasn't disappointed, I enjoyed building my cities which could grow quite quickly once you have managed to start making good money. I found some difficulty when I first realised that when the houses evolved they needed to be rehomed and I had to do a lot of remapping of my city to fit in my estates. My own fault for not checking the tutorial before each campaign mission. It's all about balance. Big cities can be hard to manage if you haven't got the means to meet everyones needs. Also vagrants don't stop coming, by trying to house all your workers more vagrants come to the citie even if you don't have the jobs for them. This doesn't stop you from being able to play the game, it is only a slight annoyance in that you can't really create a perfect city.It also has a military side to it for those who would like it, adding another level in the game. Trying to keep yourself well defended whilst also keeping your city happy and growing adds the next difficulty to the game.			",24,3,0,10,20,1,6

												Although I've only played this game for a few hours on steam, I can assure you that I've racked up more time playing this game, as I've still got the hard copy from when it first came out from 2006, and let that be an indicator of how good of a game this is.  To start with, the game is very simplistic in design and approach, but don't let that fool you into think this game is easy.  To put it simply, it is relaxing but challenging, but the challenge can be set harder if you want to try at a much more diffcult level.  But overall, this game is a pleasure, and, I should think I will play many more hours to this game for many years to come.			",61,6,0,9,10,0,18

												City Building and Civilization come together in this city-state based game. Build your settlement from just a few huts into a detailed and thriving center of trade, conquest and research. The game reminds me alot of the ANNO series where you have settlers that come into your city, you have to fill certain needs, and they level up. A player can choose from a free-build city, to doing the campaign, and even beyond to playing your own custom maps that YOU as a player can create. A few things I have noticed that are not accurate, is that aquaduct technology allowed for one main trunk to branch into smaller segments, in this game that does not occur so you do not get the representation of the True aquaduct system. However the gameplay was not affected by this. One thing that I do NOT like about it is that I found the maps to be small. I mean really small. I constantly had a high unemployment. Apparently settlers just come in even if there is no spare work slots. And the workers dont leave if you bulldoze work places if you move them. Documented sources via gametap.com/formus have stated that ""when happiness is positibe, immigrants arrive reguardless of housing and cause unemployment and housing chrises"" With this said its kinda broken in a sence if you have 100% happiness you will always have a high unemployment. Another thing is that widescreen support is not automatically built into the game on download. (As also documented in steam forums) HOWEVER there are fixes and solutions for this that can be found on google.Now then for the positives. It is a simple game. The menus are easy to navigate, and the gameplay is easy and quick to comprehend. For example Wheat farm -> Wheat -> Mill -> Flour -> Bakery -> Bread.  Another thing is that it IS addictive. looking at my clock I played 3-4 hours on one map straight through. Please remember to set yourself a timer when you play this game I will not be responsible if you spend 3 whole days on the game and forget to eat or sleep. Yes it is that addicting. Other thoughts : I wish widescreen resolution was included with the game. I wish there was alot more realism, for example you cant build on mountains.. Yet the alps are in the north, and the apennine run through the center. I am quite sure the Romans found a way around that.Overall : Would recommend. Due to price. Recommend x 1.5 ..

Not even steams advice has helped me.

												Normally don't write reviews but alot of you don't no or remember this classic game, well worth it for your collection!For Any one That loves Simcity 4, stronghold series, age of empires, total war! this Old Game Puts Together them all together into a roman empire builder, make you wonder where other games got there ideas from. Its a classic but well worth having, If you can find it on sale even better! you can loose yourself for hours in a map, Its made by firefly studios who eventually came out with the strong hold series, so its very easy to catch on to, kinda wish they kept some ideas for strong hold from this game.must have game for any civ builder out thereGame is mainly based on eco mode for campain series, individual maps let you play with a military mode. only con is it is not in widescreen and for as old as the game is the ai isnt all that great in military mode but still is worth playing. it would be nice to see firefly remake this game, a great classic that could be very popular now if redone right.Even tho its not wide screen graphics are still sharp and clear on bigscreen ",178,16,48,17,50,1,40

												I was a victim of Microsoft's deceptive ""'X' means consent"" policy for upgrading to Windows 10, and it did cause some problems with this game. The thing is, I'm not too upset with that (in this case), because this game really hasn't held up very well.I originally bought this from Direct2Drive (before Gamefly killed it), and back then I had a pretty good time with it. So I recently re-bought it on Steam... and like I said, it hasn't held up. The ability to see inside your citizens' houses is nice, but that's really all that this game has going for it. Truth is, there are other games out there that do the same things that CivCity Rome does, but do it better.If you're short of funds and just want a city builder to mess around with for a few hours (and don't have anything to compare it to), then this game works (Win10 troubles aside). But if you want something a bit more solid, I have a few suggestions:Imperium Romanum: If you're looking for a Roman-themed city builder, this one has a day/night cycle, more detailed citizens, better graphics and is overall just a better game (IMO).Children of the Nile: All of the above (except it's Egyptian-themed), plus it has a nice ebb and flow to the daily life of your citizens.Tropico (1, 3, 4 or 5): You can't go wrong with any version you choose (my preference is 4), with very detailed citizens, more building options, and overall just more stuff to do.So if you're thinking about buying CivCity Rome, for a little bit of extra coin you'd be better off getting one of these instead. And if you already have one or more of them, by all means do NOT buy it. You won't be impressed.			",50,10,0,29,41,0,15

												I love this game. I have played it plenty. I am desperate to see it get brought into the 21st century and become an awesome roman city simulator idea...The core game is already infinitley playable and with a bit of depth honestly is a £30-£40 game for me.. Features/direction I would love to see any developers go....(off the top of my head as i get so many ideas when playing this game it does that...1 Focus on the non army aspect and make it a city builder2 Focus on the ecomony part of it. Larger number of different products and shops..i.e more detailed items of clothing, diverse food3 easier to micro manage what goods go to what warehouse and food in granaries...i think the population sizes could be alot bigger i.e 10-20 folk working on farms..4. More in depth market places / possibly more complex salary system and taxation5. successful/ unsuccesful shops - or supply demand features for goods in areas..I honestly wouldnt care too much about historical correctness just keep the overall feel and playability..maybe even add egyptian stuff perhaps... I think the overall feel of the game is tremendous and just needs next level depthFeels a bit dated but if brought up to modern gaming standards and a bit of complexity and depth added to the overall city builder aspect I really think this could be an all time great game. I just wish I happened to own a computer game company and be a software developer instead of a punter ha...i have no idea if any of this is possible. I just think if they came up with this when they did it surely this is not outwith the realms of possibility... ",1,0,1,1,2,0,4

												Can verify the complaint that some of the workers will stop working or not start working in a profession, which causes an inability to complete a campaign mission. Did this early in the campaigns with me so I'm limited on how much I can play, however it looks like an otherwise good game if you can actually play it. Will probably change to a ""yes"" on the recommendation if this glaringly serious bug gets fixed since it kind of does play like Pharaoh which is a game I really like.			",17,1,0,9,11,0,8

												The game has great gameplay, good graphics and good mechanics. The campain of the game is entertaining and as you progress, it does tend to get more and more challenging. You can build huge cities and it does makes you think about building placement. I personally like it because I love Roman history and this game teaches you some of the concepts of how people lived in Ancient Roman society. Downfall is, limited space (after few hours of building your city, you tend to start running out of space). In freebuild mode, trade system is very limited. But overall, the game is very entertaining and I can definetly see myself spend 100s of hours playing this game without a doubt. So far I haven't noticed any bugs, so that means it was well programmed. Rating: Graphics 7/10              Replayability 9/10              City Managment 10/10               Mechanics 8/10              Strategy 10/10              Campaign 8/10              Battle Mechanics 1/10              Research Tech Tree 4/10I know this game is old and all, but it would be great if the developers would go back to it and design more stuff and add it as a DLC (which I would definetly buy). Maybe even a multiplayer where you try to sabbotage other cities or help one another with trade.			",8,3,0,6,17,0,10

												Civ City: Rome is considered part of the Civilization series but the gameplay is nothing like the Civilization series in any way, shape or form. That said...CivCity: Rome does a lot of things right in terms of a real time city building game. The pieces are there and they function well without trying to do too much. The controls are intuitive, the graphics are still decent, the AI is smart enough to properly function without having to pay extra special care to strange or weird behavior and the game runs just fine on newer operating systems such as Windows 10 and 7 OS (baring Windows 8). The single player campaign, which is divided into two seperate branches, one which is peaceful and focuses strictly on city building and improving citizens lives; the other half focuses on the finer balance between maintaining a city while keeping small armies at bay. Over the course of the single player campaign, the game does a fine job at maintaining a good difficulty curve and explaining how to use the tools at your disposal in terms of services, businesses, homes and production.There are stand alone maps which you can play from the get go where you can expand and grow your cities to your own vision aside from the campaign. There is no multiplayer, but there is a map editor so you may go and form new terrain to challenge yourself and your city building abilities. As for technical issues, the game is trapped in working with resolutions that can't go beyond roughly 1024x700 or so. I've attempted to edit files to up the resolution, but this causes serious stability issues or the game to simply not function. But this is hardly a deal breaker, as the game still looks good for it's age and it's wrinkles don't show to much.Pros:-Fluid and intuitive-Well balanced-Well paced campaign-Map editor-Well directed AICons:-Low aged resolutionI honestly can't pick any flaws out of this game. It's very well done and thought out and almost something of a gem, especially if you enjoy a good city building game. Just don't go in expecting to create massive expansive cities of course.

												Oldie but goodie. The number of Rome-themed city-building games is oddly high, but this one is my favorite. Not for anyone who likes the RTS/combat aspect, as that part is rubbish here. But if not, it can be really fun, at least through the campaign. The stand-alone scenarios have limited replayability, and though you CAN make your own maps (and campaigns!) the tool to do so is not user friendly and there are some bugs in it. Overall though, a great way to spend some time building & managing, especially for the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want the quick summary see the last paragraph.Let's start with the controls. The controls are actually good. They are quite responive. The game allows some control over the camera view in the form of zoom and rotate, which when playing with city builders is a big plus. Which brings me to the next topic, graphics. They are pleasant to look at and sufficiently do their jobs. The learning curve is not difficult. You can easily learn how to play in an evening. The tutorial is ok, and the rest can be learned through trial and error. However don't let the ease of learning fool you, the game has a wide difficulty range and has a good capacity for interesting challange.The pause feature is terrible. You cannot look at the building choices or descriptions while paused. It will automatically unpause you. It makes it rather difficult to decide what would work well in your city when you can't take the time to examine your options closely. Another problem I have is with numbers. You can't just hover over a house to see how many people live there or hover over a farm and see the max capicity of jobs. You can see overall values in the summary but not the individual details. It becomes hard to strategize correctly when important information is missing. The next issue is sizing. Maps are too small which makes the problem of buildings being too big worse. The map editor feature leaves a lot to be desired and feels incomplete, like they threw it together last minute. I have yet to see a glitch and it runs smoothly on Windows 7. The game might not have glitches but compared to the other games in the same genre that came before the game is lackluster.So in short. Is it fun? Yes, if you like city builders. Is it the best city builder? No, there are much better city builders, like Caesar III or Pharaoh. Should I get it? If you like city builders and the game is on sale then maybe.			",13,15,0,5,14,0,6

												I started building a city. It was a nice city, with thriving, happy citizens and enough shops for them to upgrade their houses. Then it happened.My mill refused to make flour. I don't know why; they were on strike or something. It absolutely ruined me. Citizens up and left because of the lack of bread. Eventally I was left with some citizens who were happy with just some water and meat. Thank ♥♥♥♥ for those guys. Then I deleted the save.Great game, 10/10 would starve people unintentionally again.

												This game is MEH!I cannot say its a bad game, because its not, but it sure ain't a great game either.It is a poor game trying to do similar things to the Caesar and Pharaoh games. In fact, its the exact same gameplay with poorer features everywhere and no lively city either. Everything looks and feel lifeless.The only thing better is the walker ai who is more understandable and controllable that the ones in Caesar and Pharaoh. THATS it!All the map are repetitive in the extreme and boring to play too.Can't recommend to play this game.See ya!			",76,10,0,33,37,0,41

												got this game on sale and am so happy i did! it is fun and has goals :) not sure what else to say it is a city building simulation set in the roman era. easy to use interface and yes dated graphics but they are clear and concise. tutorial is ok. took me a few min to figure out how to rotate the buildings...ikr? love building simulation games and this one was a very nice surprise since i had never even heard of it till was looking at on sale games. i is also worth full price...it is very well done and under publisized but that is just my opinion ^^			",166,257,0,45,76,0,16

												I love Civ and I love City simulations, I'm very familiar with this game genre.  CivCity Rome is pretty good, but it has some bug that need to be addressed.  I've played 31 hours over the last two weeks, and I have found some minor bugs in the game. Sometimes, but workers sleep in when its work time.  My docks unload very slowly or not at all. Why wont my houses improve when they are surrounded by plenty of services.  I would like to see overlays to see which building are negatively affecting my houses, is that the problem? Citizens seem to get stuck in ruts and ingore the bath or food they need to improve housing, even though there is plenty in the city and near by. I like the game, but I'm barely in the 4/5 part of the campaign and I've spend many hours just trying to past basic hurtles.  Maybe I dont yet understand the game mechanics.  I have not given up, but at this point I can't recommend other people buy the game until the bugs are fixed or explained.  Something is not working consistantly.			",11,1,0,1,5,0,7

												This game is awesome and very much like the original Ae of Empires.  Just a 3D version.  But that's not what I love about it.  The thing that intrigues me the most is the in-depth resource collecting process.  Though, the buildings will instantly appear, some of them take time to build and it works better with the research system.  Your citizens have realistic needs and all that, so they will need you to know how to play the game.  This game is classic and a sure 10/10 snowflakes.			",74,8,0,7,16,0,8

												After playing the single player campaign and retrying several times, I'm convinced there are game-breaking bugs in the game (i.e. some people intermittently never work, which breaks the supply chain, which makes reaching goals impossible).  So I have to give a thumbs down.Original review below.-----------------------------------Very similar game mechanics compared to Stronghold Crusader - i.e. bribing people with food allows overtaxation.  Also happiness and population control become a major part of the game.Another game mechanic which is not in SC, is households upgrading and increasing tax income.  It's an interesting game mechanic, but it gets tedious sometimes -- sort of feels like a debugging exercise trying to figure out why a house doesn't upgrade when all the services it needs are very close.There's also a technology tree.  It doesn't open any new buildings, it just upgrades the current ones (or equivalent).  There is a bit of weighing ""should I build a new building or research a tech with the money I have available?""  Also if you make the technology ""too good"" you lose some ability to control mood and it pushes the city into a different population tier.The music and voice acting are pretty good -- nothing annoying here.  However, on hard mode riots break out ad naseum and it becomes unbearably repetitive digging up ashes and laying another house as a replacement, or trying to remember what building was sitting there in what now is a pile of ashes.  The memory part is fun, but most of the time they are just shacks that need to be rebuilt.For a sale price, and especially if you enjoy city builders, this is not a bad game.  It is dated but what do you want from a city builder?  No it doesn't have drone-view, but it's still about as much fun as newer offerings, and priced much better.			",40,9,2,27,29,1,32

												This game is completely broken.  A glitch causes workers in an entire profession to just stop working, and never start again, meaning you can't procede in the game, and whats worse, is the glitch seems to just start at any given time, meaning you can't know if 10 hours into the game, it will just stop working.  This really sucks because it is a fun game that just doesn't work.  I'm not the only one having this problem either, there are multiple forums of people with the same issue.			",1,0,0,8,3,0,9

												I'm not sure if I paid money for this or if it came free in a bundle, because it's been in my library for a while.  I hope the latter, because while it looks cute and seems to play decently at first, everything begins to unravel as soon as the scenarios get a tiny bit more challenging.  By the time I was playing Britannia, I realised that there was only superficial control of basic economic functions and none of the things that I wanted and needed to do were possible. I could tell a warehouse to send  one commodity to another warehouse, but I couldn't tell workers to stop gathering the raw resource (the only way to control a glut of supply was to demolish the worker's station).  I couldn't prioritse manufacturing at any particular workshop (Settlers could do that 20 years ago, so...really?)  I couldn't manage workforce supply and demand by assigning additional carriers either.Even basic functionality was missing.  For example, there is no prompt, visual or verbal, to tell you that one of your residences is either devolving due to lack of desired resources or needing intervention in order to evolve.   The first one in the tutorial is brought to your attention, but that's it.There are only verbal prompts (hard luck if you are a hard of hearing games player who uses captions) and no other sign of something wrong when granaries and warehouses get full, or when food is close to running out.You cannot even zoom out to see the whole map at a glance and half of every single map is unusable due to bumpy terrain, with no option to do anything about this.So I rate this game as frustrating and annoying once the initial charm wears off. I did however laugh quite heartily at Spartacus and his East London accent.  I kept waiting for him to break out into full Cockney or steal a diamond or a rare pair of flintlock muskets.  Sadly, I was disappointed in that as well.			",42,23,1,18,20,0,22

Among all the garbage was this game, this ♥♥♥♥ing masterpiece, I saw their price for it, which was like, 20 or 25 dollars. Me, being a kid and not having any money, I stole it. From that day in the spring of 2004 started an addiction that lasted a strong six years. What ended it? My mom wanted to clean and she destroyed the CD with a ♥♥♥♥ing bounty papertowel.I love this game and you better bet your sweet♥♥♥♥♥I paid 10$ for it!

												I'm sorry but this game is really poor. Firstly it shamelessly rips off the Caesar series of games.  Secondy it's not as good.  I'd hoped to see something soecial from this game which is a decade more recent (or thereabouts) from the 1st Caesar but the graphics are very disappointing and there's some sort of bug which means your workers won't do their jobs.  Which means that even with two fire stations fires totally destroyed my second city whilst the firemen did nothing.   To effectively just copy someone else's game without bringing anything new on board is reallyy poor.  But to do it very badly too ? I expect a lot better from Firaxis.			",153,17,3,25,15,3,28

												I never thought I would enjoy so much a game from 2006. It reminds me of the good old Caesar II but even better.10€ it's a little too much but buy it if it's on sale and you do enjoy the genre.8/10			",90,9,4,11,6,1,4

												A lack of classic city-building strategy games led me to try out CivCity Rome. Though it has its shortcomings, it is still a very good buy, and is often on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game as it was made from two great developers, Firefly (Stronghold Series) and Firaxis (XCOM:EU/EW, Civilazation Series). It has a mix of both developers such as researching technologies from Firaxis and the city building from Firefly. There is a small portion of combat gameplay but not on a grand scale or as broad as such from the Stronghold or Civ Series. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a sim city builder with the concepts from Firefly and Firaxis.			",244,40,4,27,41,1,35

												i went out on a whim and bought this game. never heard of it, never seen it, obviously never played it. what a total barn find! this game is absoluetly amazing. i loved the caesar series to death and was hoping to find something at least somewhat similar. Low and behold i did. Not excatly the same. many great difference. but easy to understand, super relaxing, and tons of fun. into city building/ management? buy this game!			",153,7,1,19,26,0,33

												Ok so it turns out that the game decided to start crashing on startup for no apparent reason. Also, any properties you change (such as running in compatibility mode) will cause the game to give the error ""Failed to find steam"". And there is no documentation of fixing this problem because no one plays CivCity: Rome.[DATA EXPUNGED]Playable on widescreen monitors (though there seems to be no support for it) and runs stable on modern computers.CivCity: Rome is a city builder. If you like city builders, you'll like CivCity: Rome. ",185,24,0,31,31,0,49

												I can remember playing this as a child, which is the main reason i bought it, and everything is just as i remembered it, on the surface it is a very simple city builder game, but as the campaign progresses you gain access to higher level buildings that can really make your town thrive			",135,16,5,41,27,0,37

												This game is amazing! Despite been that old still enjoyble and full of life. However, many city building games are rarely made and barely seen out there like this one in particular. The mechanics on this game are incredible, if you enjoy watching the inside homes, products been made, and deliver and much more... And you know the rest, keeping happines rate up, reasearch for better stuff and making a great city overall. Overall, this game deserves more and I honestly would rate it 10/10 on everything. Great piece of relic was made back then and still lives big. My only hope is that one day, we'll see a newer version like this one on the future.			",40,7,2,9,15,0,6

												A decent older RTS game that still has some replayability left in it. I grabbed it on sale a while back. Not worth it now at 10.99$ though.You're tasked with the successful creation, building and governance of cities. If you've played most RTS this one comes with a variety of stores, entertainment options, production abilities, etc.The graphics aren't bad and are dated what with this game being a decade old. The missions are somewhat fun.One of the drawbacks I found was that in building a city I'd have a population that would soon run out of control.I couldn't house all of my people and the popultion kept climbing.On sale for under $5 this is worth it for a laugh or t			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this while it was on sale.  While I still have some nuances to master in the development of fully functioning cities, even getting as far as I have was an enjoyable challenge.  Definitely a steal for the sale price, but having played it now I would be happy to have bought it at full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a fun cheap simulation of what Rome really was like, and in short its pretty accurate. The game doesn't bring Barbarians into the picture alot, other then sending your Cohorts to attack them they most likely wont come back for one reason or another. Trading is difficult to learn at first. The ability to hire transports to make it easier to upgrade houses would be a fun feature. This game is a good game for 10$ and will always be a top favorite for when im bored. Enjoy!			",73,8,0,7,14,0,34

												Short, but sweet. I completed it within about 7-8 hours, but it is quite an intriguing game similar to the Caesar series. I'd recommend it as a throwaway game... it's certainly not as deep as Caesar III is, but it provides a bit of interest for a few hours.			",8,5,18,3,13,0,19

												I had this game on a disc 5-6 years ago, but the disc broke 'bout 3 years ago. It's a great game, I'll admit that, but I wish this game's engine worked on a Windows 8 system. Waste of money if you are buying it on a Windows 8, which is probably the worst of it's kind in systems.Edit: My old system only had 2 gigs of ram, my newer 6 gig runs it great.			",24,4,0,6,21,0,14

												If you like Sim City then this game is actually kinda cool, it tells you the story of how the Roman Empire grew from tent camps and wandering travelers to massive cities while teaching you the history of how and when and what and why certain improvements were created. (Not to mention the ingame encyclopedia on Old Roman history explaining alot of daily life routines indepth trough the game itself..) Worth buying if you like to challenge yourself, this one might be too boring for your first person shooter nerds ;P			",138,20,3,16,42,0,62

												This is a lovely little game. The free to play nature and the pleasant music makes for many hours of imaginative creativity. I remember playing this when it was release many years ago, it was one of my favourite games. Although I would say that there are some issues to the game. The first one being the fact that things get quite boring once you've mastered the correct technique to expand your city and improve your hovels.Another issue, (although this may be a ""one off"") is the occasional failure of avatars to carry out their work. For example, the Well worker, the firemen and the tunic weaver tend to either sleep or wait about instead of work. This is a significant problem because it means I am unable to progress through the campaign, and it also halts any chance of progression.Aside from these pointers, it's a lovely game (if you're lucky to not have these issues).

												A fantastic city builder, the quality is high enough to feel like a civic spin off from the Age of series. The replay value is very high, with a civic and a military campaign, single mission options, a map editor, and of course, various skill levels to challenge yourself with. For being a game from 2006, it plays extremely well. While the graphics aren't stunning, they are on par with the already mentioned Age of series. If you like city builders, RTS, Rome, or economic games then give this a try.			",20,0,0,1,5,0,8
