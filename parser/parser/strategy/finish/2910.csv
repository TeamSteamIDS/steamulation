												Entertaining and realistic naval warfare simulator where the player acts as a commander of a whole fleet, which includes various ships (transporters, aircraft carriers, battleships), submarines, planes (fighters, bombers, scouting) and helicopters, along with all their instruments. That includes many different radars, missiles and torpedoes. The scenarios allow for creativity and tactics, as in most missions you are given the fleet to command, but how you use it is up to you. Usually the success depends on all units and instruments working together, but as even single missions are somewhat randomized (the same mission plays differently when playing second time because enemy units spawn in different locations and in different quantities etc.) and require adjusting tactics or adapting new ones. Did you use bombers in this mission and replay it? Now you might get surprised the AI has much more powerful air force, but perhaps at the cost of submarines? Moreover the game has a huge amount of vehicles and weaponry from various countries, South and Northern American, European, Middle Eastern and Asian. Missions also happen on different places of the world with many different sides. One time you sink Brazilians as Argentinians, the other you sink Chinese as Taiwanese, and so on (though it seems everybody speaks English). You can also choose single missions of different difficulty, beginning with the easiest and slowly getting into more and more challenging ones as a great way to learn the game and form tactics. This is probably the best and the most fun naval combat game I've ever played. In addition, if you are new to the genre, you can set to automatic many settings, which will make a bit more similar to more popular RTS genre and get you accustomed to use of various radars, weapons and vehicles.10/10 (Awaiting my doritos!)PS. install nGlide to get rid of menu flickering on modern hardware.

												Detect unknown airborne track.Don't bother to VID track.FIRE SM-2s!Kill track.You killed an Airbus A300 and replicated Iran Air Flight 655.Despite the above scenario occurring, this is a very fun, moderately realistic game where you spend hours watching NTDS symbols move towards each other, sometimes very slowly, and the highest time compression is not very large. However, some scenarios will have you playing for hours in normal time as you desperately try to intercept all Granit ""Shipwreck"" missiles before they cripple your battlegroup. There really hasn't been an accessible and polished game since to replace this.Most systems have simplified characteristics; the game's primary focus appears to revolve around carrier operations and the Aegis combat system partnered with the SM-2 missile. Oh, the SM-2. What a wonderful bit of kit. Kills planes, missiles, even ships. A pathetic little gunboat is shooting down all your Harpoons? No problem, send an SM-2 to do the job. All your Tomahawk anti-ship missiles going for the oil tanker next to the ♥♥♥♥ing huge Russian battlegroup? No problem! Semi-active radar homing means no more missiles straying off course and killing neutrals. More than one missile coming at you? No problem! The long range and SPY-1 lets you shoot at multiple targets simultaneously.Graphics are very dated, it is an old game, but as you spend most of the time looking at tracks on a map, it doesn't really matter. There are graphical issues nowadays, which can be mostly solved by installing a 3Dfx Voodoo glide wrapper such as nGlide.			",2072,775,72,172,319,16,321

												A really good simulator (it was even used by the US naval academy to train students of naval tactics).Pros:+immersive strategy game which requires you to think because wrong moves can give dire consequences+tactical options in the game are good you can even choose what weapon will the ship engage the enemy with+the game offers ships that have the  characteristics and weapon's systems that of their real life counter-partsCons:-outdated graphics (because it was made in the 90s and the graphics for this game was good at that time)-optimization issues(especially when using windows xp)-some bugs now and then but not to the point that it's unplayable-tutorial is a bit confusingconclusion:overall its a good game but it is the only game of its kind most naval battle games are not as challenging as this so i give it a 10/10			",42,3,0,4,8,0,7

												A wonderful Track killing simulator and probably the best avenue to start playing naval RTS before you move to games like Harpoon or Command: Naval/Air Operations. The addition of the Naval Warfare Project mod improves the game dramatically.I wish it had faster time compression and a more accurate detection system. The ranges at which enemies are detected and indentified do not feel very believable, and the time compression feels too slow, especially if you're playing with no aircraft.At the time of this review, the game is $5, and you get 2 other good naval sims along with it ('688(I) Hunter Killer' and 'Sub Command'). Or you can pay a bit more and get Dangerous Waters too!I highly recommend Fleet Command, but note that you may have some issues with modern graphics hardware.			",322,23,14,49,82,3,112

												THE Naval Wargame, without exception. Harpoon/Command are nice but get really boring, unless you are a diehard tactician, when you want to actually SEE your ships do something! There are a few problems playing this game on newer systems but just about all of them have a fix listed on the community hub here on Steam.The fact that this game hasn't been remade with modern units/scenarios and up-to-date graphics is absolutely baffling to me since this game has earned and kept the crown of best Naval Wargame of all time for over 16 YEARS. Any developers out there that feel you can handle it, buy this license NOW and remake this game, you will get your ROI off preorders alone! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really, REALLY want this game. Or what this game should be. I have been trying to find a pseudo-simulator for grand scale battles in naval warfare, and this is it. Sadly, I can't recommend it for anyone. Too many things don't work well. It's hard to get working. It's no longer supported by the developer. And even once you get it working, little things break in gameplay that make it hard to enjoy. At some point, subs broke completely; now they go on autopilot and refuse to engage or come to the surface (yes, I'm aware of the setting that supposedly fixes this; it doesn't work for me). Missiles disappear on launch from destroyers or cruisers. Airplanes disappear on launch from carriers. It makes play kinda worthless.Gameplay wise, you're a fleet commander and you have to tell everyone what to do. Literally you have to command a combat plane in the middle of a battle to take the mach 1.4 contact that's headed straight towards him. I'm pretty sure a combat pilot wouldn't be waiting for orders from HQ. Ditto subs: they do nothing even at close contacts. Planes avoid missiles only when they get super close, and you can set it so ships self defend (again, only when missiles close to within certain death distance). The level of micro-management necessary is far beyond what a...fleet commander would have to do.It's also irritating that certain obvious non-moveable targets (enemy airports) are unidentified, and you have to get within range of SAMs to identify them. Enemy ships and planes can ID and shoot you from afar, but you have to close to within visual to ID them. You learn quickly to preemptively shoot at anything moving above mach 0.5. Shouldn't I be able to tell the nature of these enemies from their radar emissions? And forget about cruise missile strikes on those airports once you've figured out where they are. For some reason, SAMs have no problem seeing and killing them, even if you launch 50 at one airport none will land. Jam the SAM sites, kill all nearby planes and literally a plane will lift off, kill all your missiles and flip you the bird before you can do anything.  It's just too hard to kill land targets to be realistic. You run out of ammo instead.A lot of the scenarios are interesting, but many of them fall into the 'gotcha' category: ""you're a US carrier fleet, you have no early warning or combat planes in the air, and there are unidentified enemies within 10 miles of you (really, how exactly did I get in this position?). But they apparently know who you are because suddenly there are 200 missiles headed your way! Personally, more interesting to me is the feint, maneuver, initial contact and jabs of the conflict than struggling to defend (yes, you have to tell individual ships to shoot down every one of those missiles in real time unless you want them to get too close to defend properly).TL;DR: the seed of a great game for those interested in the subject. Lot of little bugs and issues make it tedious and irritating that will never, unfortunately, be fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although it is a bit old school, it is a Great game. It is actually a polished version of Great Naval Battles. Scenarios are great and replayability is fine. Actually it is even better than Naval Warfare - Arctic Circle. But beware though, this game has graphical glitch problems since it is using now obsolete vodoo gfx. My laptop has two gfx cards one is Nvidia and an onboard Intel card (HD . This game runs much better in intel be informed.There is a workaraound for this problem you can easily find a program that immitates the vodoo protocol. Take a look at steam forums.

												This game has a lot going for it and is fun to play. There are single player scenarios as well as campaigns to play, and the game tracks your progress through the various missions and displays your best score with stats from each of those completed missions. Although it may take a bit of fiddling to get it open in W7, it does play and is remarkably stable. It is well worth the $4.99 that I paid for it during a recent sale and I only wish I would have picked it up sooner.			",91,8,8,8,29,1,54

												This is the classic Modern Naval Strategy Sim, and no I don't mean Real Time Strategy. While support for the game has dried up, it still remains the last great theater-level realistic Naval Sim. Since it doesn't look like anybody will make any game like this again, this is the game to get if you've ever thought of being an Admiral. This isn’t a game where you collect resources and generate units, instead you play out missions designed to simulate real world situations. You’re tasked with using what you’re given to solve the mission. This ranges from Destroyers, Aircraft Carriers, and Land Based planes and missiles to solve the mission.  While the game was made in the late 90s and the content reflects that, at the time it featured an accurate collection of most of the world’s naval forces for simulation. There have been mods created to bring it up to date, (Most notably The Naval Warfare Project, or NWP), which I highly recommend finding because they add tons of additional depth.One major criticism of the game is that it is too realistic at times. The game takes place in real time, meaning that one minute in game universe equals one minute in our time. With ships moving at 20 knots, that means for ships to move from one side of the map to the other it can take many hours of play for that to happen. The game does have a “speed up time” feature, but it doesn’t go anywhere near fast enough to make casual play of the missions possible. Expect to dedicate about 12-20 hours to some of the built in missions.  But there isn’t any newer game like this for die hard Naval Sim fans out there.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant tactical war game from the late 90's. Originally released under the Jane's name (so you know it's good) and re-released on Steam under the developers own name. Fleet command is about controlling naval assets (ships, submarines, helos, aircraft) in order to accomplish objectives.Defend against incoming cruise missile attacks, fighters and bombers while delivering deadly payloads to ships, submarines and ground facilities.Supports team on team multiplayer (no co-operative sadly).Direct X support has massive slow down with radar representation, use Glide wrapper nGlide or DGVoodoo for best performance and graphics.It looks ugly, but it's an amazingly simple and fun game.

												I bought this for 2 bucks, so I cant gripe too much.  I'm kinda bummed still.  I thought this was going to be like 688 or Sub Command....nope, dumbed down and basically no fog of war.  Not too much fun.  I'll have to look for a mod, and maybe it will be better.  www.subsim.com may have one... for 2 bucks, I'm still recommending it....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's old, very old, it could very well be the subject of the new Tomb Raider movie or the upcoming Indiana Jones movie but damn, it's good. Considdering this game was made when Vanilla Ice still made music instead of attempting to act in B flicks with Adam Sandler it is a gem. Ofcourse when playing it you can't expect it to be something it isn't, like nothing before the invention of unleaded gasoline, but even to today's standards it's an excellent game.I bet some hippie dip♥♥♥♥♥ would love to confuse this for some hipster-ish indie but it's just an incredibly well designed game with some significant depth to it. Comparing it to other tactical RTS games it still stands out for combining realism/simulation with some decent relativily fast paced fun so damn well. (I had to run it in compatibility mode on my old PC so it never recorded play time, I topped the 60 hour mark.)			",23,0,2,5,5,0,6

												Awesome game with Mod NWP.This is the only game available for you to simulate modern naval warfare at the highest level.Couple with NWP Mod, you will have the latest arsenal of naval capability such as the Queen E Carrier, the Zumwalt DDG. I do hope SCS consider to launch an updated version  of Fleet Command in near future with improved graphic and playability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As much as I'd love to love this game.It's just unbareably old from what I've seen, the game is probably best off left alone and you should instead go for either Sub Command, or Dangerous Waters.Hopefully there's other games just like this either out or in development but with more graphics, and gameplay characteristics.
