												Playing Worms Reloaded made me feel like I just opened a time capsule from 10 years ago. It shows that even such a simple game of worm warfare, can stand the test of time, and still be as entertaining as it once was.			",551,171,27,61,52,10,70

												I don't think I've ever played a game more irreverent and wacky in its humor and design while also keeping to one of the most accurate and precise physics engines I've seen in a while.Worms Reloaded is actually an updated rerelease of Worms 2: Armageddon (Do not confuse this with Worms: Armageddon. They're actually two totally different games) released in 2009 and while it's one of the older titles in the Worms franchise, it is definintely the one with the most features, gameplay modes, options, and overall fun out of the games I've played.Up to four teams each control a squad of four worms with customizable names, voices, and hats (in fact the Steam version has TF2-themed hats just for this occasion) and an arsenal of weapons ranging from rocket launchers, grenades, flamethrowers, and air strikes to ninja ropes, teleporters, and magnets to a variety of exploding wildlife and grandmas to the mighty meteorific field-wide death of Armageddon.  These worms will use said weapons to blow the living hell out of each other in a manner befitting old-school Looney Toons designed by Michael Bay.  Each worm only has a finite amount of time to make a move, inch across the battlefield, use whatever weapon or item they wish and end their turn.  A surprsing amount of things can get done during this time, but moves must be planned very carefully as just about any situation can be used against you somehow if your opponent is creative enough.The controls on the weapons are all fairly simplistic but at the same time surprisingly complicated.  The physics engine is very in depth taking into account, angle, power put behind the shot or throw, wind power and direction, and the presence of any obstacles.  The precision in which things can be done is fairly impressive and a competent player can do things that might not even seem possible.  It is worthy to note while keyboard controls are present, a controller is generally recommended for this game due to how strange buttons are mapped originally, but this can be changed.  Gravity effects everything BUT the terrain you're standing on.  The randomly generated maps and backgrounds will stay put no matter how many pieces are blown apart until you're either sitting in a crater, traverssing tunnels, or recreating Bastion.  However, even a remaining pixel can be the difference between a hit or a miss in some cases so keeping track of what was destroyed how can sometimes work to your advantage but freak accidents can always happen.One thing that's consistent throughout any worms game, especially in multiplayer, is that no matter how good one side is compared to the other, random chain reactions and other assorted problems can show up as a result of anything happening.  A grenade could be thrown and throw an enemy worm into a mine, which detonates a nearby gas canister that lights an area on fire that eats through the ground and frees up a hole for someone else to fall into- right onto a health crate that fell down previously.  But by no means is this a luck-based game.  Freak happenings aside, the mechanics, complex physics, and sheer creativity allowed in the vast arsenal of weapons and tools requires quick reflexes, careful planning, and a good knowledge of how the game works and mastering these can take quite a bit of practice.While this game is best played with friends, the single-player campaign is long and full of missions ranging from puzzles to challenges, to simply difficult missions and the AI at later levels is surprsingly advanced given how complex the rest of the game is.  Unfortunately, the campaign isn't really worth playing more than once as each mission has a special 'trick' to it that can render it fairly easy in the hands of a skilled player.  The actual multiplayer is where most of the action is.  Randomly generated landscapes of a variety of colors, themes and backgrounds from ancient Egypt to Hell to outer space never makes for the same game twice and customizable maps and game modes allow for more exacting factors to be controlled ahead of time should you wish it.  Due to the antics of how the game works, I recommend you play with actual friends either in person (It's worth noting that local multiplayer only needs a single controller) or online, but online multiplayer is also a perfectly viable option.  Fair warning to those who care, however: There is no word censor in this game and enemy team or word names you come across online can be inappropriate.Overall this is a fantastic multiplayer game that, if plugged into a large monitor, projector, or TV can make a fantastic couch party game that doesn't rely heavily on the RNG, but has just enough chance to allow laughs at a chain of explosions due to a misplaced land mine.  There's enough customization to keep games from getting boring or samey and custom teams are always fun to deal with and it's very easy to personify the little guys and give each of your team a distinct personality or strategy type in your head.  The single-player allows for a lot of time invested and makes for good practice and a rewarding experience by itself.  Still, only get this game if you plan on playing it with friends.

												Great game, but there's one massive caveat which makes it more or less useless for linux: The multiplayer functionality is platform-dependent; no playing between different operating systems! If you're on linux like me, there are effectively zero games on wormnet, so you're effectively stuck playing on your own. I instead suggest getting the original Worms: Armageddon (I bought it for £2 on ebay) and play that. It works very well in wine...			",11,5,0,1,2,0,2

Nowhere in the store or descriptions did I see that macs and pcs cannot play together so I just wasted a lot of money.

												Not the best Worms ever, but pretty solid.They simplified most of the features present in World Party, but it nails a good balance overall. In example, you can now have a maximum of four worms per team, but it's harder to send them in the water.Not sure the ones after this match it, but I found this an enjoyable and funny entry in the series.

												Worms Reloaded is a fun game to play, especially with friends. It will bring you some hilarious gaming moments. Funny voices, movie references, and what not, this game should not be taken too seriously.Playing the campaign and the extra game packs can be quite challenging. You can easily get 50+ hours of gameplay from it. If you haven't played any of the Worms games before, Worms Reloaded is a great game to start with.			",58,19,0,3,4,0,6

												Well, I bought this game for a friend and me to play online together. And while this game has been ported to Linux and Mac OS there is still a glaring problem with the multiplayer. There is no bloody cross-platform multiplayer allowed. That is, if one person with a Windows machine wants to play with a friend running a Linux Mint 17 machine, well tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ they can't play together. The term cross-platform shouldn't even be used in these situations, each platform is the same in this case, they are all PC's. Seriously, it's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized use of the word cross-platform which is usually asscociated with PC's and consoles not being able to play multiplayer games.Seriously Team17, get this crap fixed. Your blatent dismissal of this problem really pisses off your fans. All we want to do is play with friends, but we can't do that.			",119,7,4,10,9,0,3

												Good old Worms. Worms Reloaded is the perfect game for everyone who loved Wormes Armageddon. The Weapon Arsenal is pretty big and you will find everything you want. From the basic Bazooka to the Holy Grenade and the awesome Banana-Bomb. If you don't know Worms, just know that this game is one of the best local-Multiplayer-Games out there. The Campaign is ok and packs some challenges, but you basically buy this game for all the joy and frustration you will cause you and your buddys. The Presentation is nice, funny and timeless, but i can't emphasize this enough: Play it with your Friends, they'll love/hate you for it^^			",109,27,5,13,1,0,11

												I used to have hours of fun playing Worms as a kid with my friends, and I'm glad it hasn't really changed all that much since then, I can still jump right into it and pick up from where I left off. It's a great free for all turn-based ""party game"" that requires the participants to be super crafty in blowing up as many of their opponents as possible. It's simply a fun game and I would say this version is pretty well done. People are pretty nice online, it's more fun with fellow novices in front of the same screen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a fan of the Worms series since I was a kid. I enjoy the new games, but I always keep coming back to Reloaded, because it has the old school feel, but with some improvements. You can customize your team with nice hats, colors, classic and new speechbanks. Also, there's a great number of ladscapes to choose if you got the Game of The Year Edition. If you are a solo player, there's a lot of content to keep you busy and achievements to conquer. The online matches works fine, but the real fun is to play locally with your friends and family. It never gets old!			",356,81,21,51,56,6,66

Get ready folks, 2D Worms and back in action!Team 17 presents: The Return of Worms in Worms ReloadedEver since the time the team switched from 2D to 3D, the Worms games had become mediocre. However, the developers have heard the fans voices - reverting back to the old school 2D classic we all know to love! After winning the game in a giveaway, I decided I'd review it right here for you guys!What is Worms ReloadedWorms is a 2D platform game which can be played alone or with friends online.The main attraction to the game is that you can blow your enemies to smithereens, destroying them in any way you want to, whether that be prod of kamikazes!If you wish to know more about the specifics of this game, check them out on steam. As well as this, you can check out the official website here for more information on the entire Worms games series!CampaignIn the campaign mode, you'll compete in up to 35 single player missions, as well as having warzone missions to keep you entertained once those have been completed. As well as this, for those who have never played the game, there is quite an informative tutorial, giving you all the intel required to play and master Worms.As well as this, you also have other game modes to experience. You could try your luck with the bodycount mode, which is basically a survival - beware, only the experienced player will beat this, you'll have to be amazing at the game to survive!As for the campaign, it's not really all too difficult. Planning beforehand and strategizing your movements will allow you to easily defeat the campaign. Along with the side-missions, the single player will probably give you around 10 to 15 hours of solid, fun gameplay.GameplayThe gameplay is the same formula all the other games of the series has used, the movement is done via a simple input with the arrow keys, and jumping with the enter key. Shooting and aiming is done with the space bar and arrow keys (up and down), with different weapons being selected with your mouse.The game is amazingly fun, the unpredictability of the enemy team and the amount of customizability with weapons and other factors make it amazingly fun, giving you the nostalgic feeling of being back in the early 00's playing the old-school Worms game we all know and love.The acrobatic techniques such as backflips and other amazing stunts help you scale platforms otherwise not possible with a normal jump. With many platforms and different maps to consider (though they'll all destructible), the Worms game offers a unique experience like no other!Note; As for the controls, the game can also be played with a gamepad as well. It's absolutely great, works like a charm and is a lot less clumsy than the keyboard and mouse configuration.After playing the game extensively, I'll rate the gameplay 9/10. It's fun, very well polished and comes across as a great aspect of the game.MultiplayerThe multiplayer is really what makes the game what it is. Without it, it'd be a lot less fun and let's be honest, who wants to fire against the AI all day? New features to this great addition to the series include voice chat and the ability to invite steam friends when making a private match.Multiplayer provides two options when hosting matches, private or public games. Once your friend/enemy appears in your lobby, you can start warming up for the battle. There are some options above your name which details the value of worms you have and what color your team will be.Before starting the game, the host is able to choose what level you are going to battle in. As well as the levels included in the game, user-created levels can be used, which is quite challenging and amazingly fun, especially if you have not played the map before.The option for online chat is always there, in every game. Screaming down the microphone is always fun, and with the press of a button you can chat to all your fellow worms within any online game that you play on the servers. It's best to play with friends, but it's also great to take your aggression out on those strangers from around the world!Upon playing this game a lot via online and with a few friends, I'd rate the multiplayer portion of the game around 8/10. There are some flaws and the voice chat definitely needs some work, but other than that it's filled with epic, fun maps that will keep you entertained for many hours.Note: You can play with 2~4 players at once in a multiplayer match, as well as playing LAN if you have some friends over.GraphicsGraphics are amazing to see, there are a lot of new HD effects, all of which enhance the bomb explosions, jetpack animations etc. The developers have also added a nice little feature in the game, the worms scream when in danger.There are also upgrades on the visual and aesthetic measures of the game, including new voices, new gravestones, as well as the addition of odd, funny hats for the worms, which is a welcomed addition to the game too.Because of the vast improvements from the game's predecessors, I'll be rating this game a 9/10 for graphics. It's been vastly improved, giving the Worms games a whole new look and feel to it. Absolutely stunning visuals, especially for a game within this genre!Extra & SpecialsFor everyone who took a pre-order of this, you'll receive exclusive in-game items, as well as the DLC. If you play or have Team Fortess 2, you'll have been rewarded with some special items for that, too.As well as this, Worms Reloaded has a in-game shop, where you can buy hats, landscapes, missions, weapons, gravestones and forts for your Worms.Since the Summer of 2011 there has been alot of DLC releases.ConclusionThis game is worth buying, it brings back the old 2D Worms with a bang and a sense of nostalgia, which is always a good thing. Achievements have made a comeback too, which is always great to see in a game like this.I'd recommend this to all my friends over here! So hurry up and grab this game today! It's time to blast some worms out of the park! NOTE: Old review i wrote for a website. ",2466,863,117,303,304,40,394

												The superior Worms Armageddon wasn't on Steam when this came out, but it is now so get that instead if you want the better experience. Awful User Interface, limited options and features, bad physics, some great weapons/items replaced with useless ones, horrible online play where custom maps flat out don't work.  Filled with bugs that the unresponsive (robotic like customer service when they do) devs don't seem to care about, Reloaded feels like a quick and cheap cash grab riding on the Worms name, avoid.

												Worms Reloaded is another fun game for when you have nothing else to play, or when you simply want to pass some time with a friend. Having played Worms games since their early arrival back in 1995 (with many fond memories), I can honestly say that this is not much different to any of the other Worms games in the Turn-Based Artillery game genre. However, as with every new Worms game that comes out on the market, it does offer new and more advanced features, and more trying challenge-modes than past games.There is not much to say other than: you have an armory of nonsensical weaponry at your disposal to kill an enemy team of worms, you cannot argue against that being worth your time.

												It isn't Worms Armageddon but can be just as fun. I find that Armageddon allowed for the most flexibility out of all worms games, and the visual effects/graphics were much more real and less arcade than reloaded. Worms reloaded still provides a good learning campaign, and the same fun gadgets that are used in other previous worms games. However the way Armageddon was put together for me beats the rest of the worms series. Reloaded just feels too... cartoon-y and paper-ish.Still a solid game.

												The best time killer that's out there at the moment. Worms Reloaded might not be a 3D game with the sickest graphics you could imagine, but let's be honest, it doesn't need to be. The gameplay is addictive and can be adapted to your own liking. You can customize your characters' look, name and even the way they sound. There's multiple game modes to choose from, so being bored won't be an option.The only negative thing about Worms Reloaded is the fact that its community isn't active anymore. You'll still find people playing it online, you'll just need alot of patience for your lobby to get filled. I can highly recommend gifting this game to your friends - so you can have some fun together - on those dull nights where boredom struck again!			",30,2,2,2,2,0,1

												No, no no!Don't buy this game and get yourself Worms Armageddon.Reloaded offers less than Armageddon and doesn't work properly.The Physics are really wonky and you need so much luck to play with your friends online.The Multiplayer is just bad. When you finally get a game together and everyone can connect to the game, you can just hope that no one gets a random disconnect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately this game does not let Windows, Mac, and Linux users play with eachother (Windows users can only play with other Windows users, Macs with other Macs, and Linux with other Linux users). As a result I cant play with my friends and I never see anyone online. I played the single player campaign and it was fun but until Team 17 lets everyone play together regardless of OS I can't recommend this game.			",95,28,3,9,20,5,27

												If the game is not bad, it is not good either. I could not recommend it because there exists on Steam a better alternative: Worms Armageddon which is the game this one was trying to remake.The term ""reloaded"" even reflects the dirty hollywoodian habit of rehashing stuff that was already good in the first place (and ultimately failing, remember The Matrix Reloaded?). The problem revolves around Team 17 trying too hard to be worthy of the cult phenomenon that was W.A and satisfying themselves with a paint job and a few additions that are not impressive enough to care about.Graphics sure are improved (although one might object, as I do, that the original sprites were better and that W.A was updated to work with HD resolutions giving a great feel to an ""old"" game) but maps and weapons are mostly imported straight back from the past (fan service has its limits) even outside of the retro pack DLC and worse: you can only get 4 worms team making rounds shorter and less strategic. Maybe the point was making the game more adapted to casual gamers, but then why make the game less fun in the same place?Then there are the ugly flaws: bad physics as illustrated by the behaviour of the ninja rope or the rebound of grenades (the original had the pride of pixel-perfect precision) and an AI level that can no more be adjusted or even shown on screen making some worms dumb as hell and others able to make humanly impossible shots (""cheating"" by using perfect trajectory predictions). Some missions designed to be hard end up just being frustrating.The developers should really move on instead of making the same game over and over and suffer the same fate as Activision. But if you really need a fun game that has great local and online multiplayer as well as a good solo campaign, look no further than Worms Armageddon, all praise the worm!			",294,203,1,44,28,1,29

												As a long-standing worms aficionado (sp?), I'm still tempted back to the randomly-generated 2d battlefields that the worms call home. New weapons, new graphics, more diverse campaign missions, and more customization (hats, victory dances, worm colour on top of added sound banks) definitely see the worms franchise moving forward.However, like I said, I'm a hardcore Worms Armageddon (1999) player and the gameplay mechanics (or the engine, I guess?) has been overhauled and it's just not the same for me. Also, teams can only have a max of 8 worms and the in depth scheme customization that I'm used to isn't present.If you're new to the Worms series, I'd definitely recommend this game. However, I go back to the old Worms Armageddon to get my fix. I'll keep poking my way around this new one though, as I'm sure there are some pleasant surprises in store for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing worms since the beginning. I still play the original on SNES. This certainly lives up to its predecessors. The single player campaigns may not be earth-shattering, but the online multiplayer and insane level of customization combined with the number of options for weapons, gravestones, worm hats, etc. make it an amazingly fun game to blast your friends in.

												I'm pretty sure most of us remember the Worms games from our childhood and that should be enough of a reason to re-start playing an oldie. Not only that it brings back memories from what feels like ages ago, but more importantly, it makes new ones aswell. Childhood memories are previous, regardless if they have been good or bad, they matter, and for that reason you should try the new and improved versions of those old games.In my opinion, this game is the perfect evolution of the older Worms games, simply because it improved graphics and movement, but didn't go all the way to the 3D trend. I think 3D should be left for complex games of other genres, not this type. The best about this game is that the idea is simple and to the point, which is why Worms Reloaded is one of the most perfect editions. I think you should try it, especially that it's not that short and you won't get bored of it, not need to say goodbye to it too soon. You can play campaign mode, casual with friends or online matches with other people. There's also additional challenges and things like that.The price is fair, and it has plenty of achievements that will keep you busy.All in all, what more reasons do you need? The game is worth it, sooo buy it and get busy with it!			",401,198,20,34,33,5,58

												Armageddon may still be the best, but this is a very good sequel to one of the best turn-based skill/action/strategy games ever. The gameplay is highly tunable and the potential trickshots and movement skills mean there are some serious hardcore worm players out there, as well as hacks like me. but it's fun for everyone, and runs great on lower hardware specs. i think it's worth far more than it's currently on sale for.

A right step forward, a good step backwardsBack when I was browsing a certain Scandinavian video game online store I came across a game called Worms Reloaded. At first I couldn't believe my eyes. How could've I missed this game? I decided to take a look what kind of game it was. Seeing only a single screenshot I knew I had to get this game. It reminded me of the simpler times. It reminded me about my old Pentium 2 PC that just barely ran Worms Armageddon.Worms Reloaded is a 2D-strategy game developed by Team 17. The game features a team based action-strategy experience where you have to eliminate the enemy team with wacky and fun wepaons. Those of you who are not familiar what makes Worms game differ from other strategic games is the way weapons, items and environment change the phase of the gameplay. You can use your weapons for dealing damage or blasting your way through dirt. Weapons can be used to modify your surrondings and tools can be used as deadly weapons. The way you use the gadgets you are given is the key to fun and challenging gameplay.The game features different kind of game modes ranging from basic campaing missions to elimination game mode towards more challenging game modes like time trials and puzzles. There's a lot of thing to do and is definetly worth playing even as a single-player experience.Even though Worms Reloaded could be argued to be a modern Worms game it still feels right and controls like a classic 2D-Worms game. It even pays homage to older Worms games by including some older maps in the game. And that makes Worms Reloaded worth buying. It is well made. It is fresh. It is amazing.Lastly, as a bit of a personal suggestion, I would suggest for you to get the DLCs. I usually never get them but seeing how many hours they add to the game (easily 50 hours) it is more than advised for you to get them if you enjoyed the base game.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												If you've never played a Worms game before, WHAT THE CRAP, MAN?!  STOP READING THIS AND BUY IT NOW!!If you have played a Worms game before, this is one is still a blast.  I played Worms Armegeddon when it came out, installed it on my high school's network harddrive so that every student who logged on could access it and play wonderfully silly local games.  And, boy, did we.  All the time.  And you could hear cursing and laughter throughout the computer lab (followed by everyone alt-tabbing or turning off the computer monitor when a teacher came over to question what we were doing).Almost fifteen years later, Reloaded has been brought back all that hilarious joy that's definitely on par with Armageddon.  Local and online multiplayer is wonderful.  Lots of cursing and laughter with friends (we don't have to hide it from any teachers this time).  And really this is why you buy this game.  Hilarious, goofy weapons to blow up your friends and curse/laugh when you fail miserably and accidentally blast yourself to smithereens.What?  You're still reading?  All right, I can say more.Good things:-Steam Achievements: a ton of achievements that make you work (some are ridiculously hard).-Multiple platforms:  I play on Mac and Windows both.  It's nice to have an option.IMPORTANT NOTE: You cannot play across platforms online (I have to play on my Windows laptop when playing with friends since most of them don't have a Mac).-Map Editor is fun.Some Blah things:-The single player campaign is nice but it felt a bit short.  For a really great extended Solo experience, you'll want to buy the DLC or the Game of the Year Edition.  (GOTY includes all DLC and provides some excellent challenges.)-A LOT of Steam Achievements are linked to the DLC, so you'll have to purchase them separately or the GOTY Edition to get all of them.  BUT DLC only works for Windows.  So even when buying GOTY Edition, you can only play the base game on Mac and Linux.The game is worth the money at full price, but it goes on sale pretty often, so I recommend keeping an eye open to snag the game for $5 or better.  (~$6.50 for GOTY)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mostly the same as Worms: Armageddon or Worms World Party, but with graphical improvements and minor details such as hats for the Worms, which helps to visually distinguish different teams.  Limiting team rosters to 4 worms (instead of the previous 8) is probably the biggest change, and certainly the biggest negative one.  A few weapons have been phased out (mine strike, for example) and a few new ones have been introduced (such as poison strike and the healing lightning strike).  The solo missions are less maddening, on average, than in previous games in the series, making it a better experience for new players.  It has also streamlined different game modes and incorporated new styles, such as time attack races and vertical maps, ideas which were originally incorporated by community hacks to W:A.Overall, it's still a tremendously fun game.  The one real disappointment is that even with the Retro Pack, not all of the maps from previous editions of Worms are available for play.  However, importing one's own custom maps in image format is quite easy.			",294,97,10,51,21,8,49

												I am a fan of Worms back in the Olden days and this game is a lot of fun. Saddly the teams have teo less worms but it has tons more weapons and the custom voice packs add a lot of fun. Also playing with friends is always a blast. If you like tbs games you will enjoy this quirk game.			",361,62,3,39,16,2,33

												I have loved Worms since the original PC version of the first game, through Armageddon, and even the 3D versions, but... I just do not like this game. This is a poor console port. PC gamers deserve better. Play Worms Armageddon instead, with the latest updates. After all the fan-made improvements to WA, I don't see how Team17 can make a worms game better than that. Prove me wrong please. Edit: In this games defense, it's way, WAY, better than Worms Revolution.			",541,239,11,61,54,7,104

												There isn't much to be said about Worms Reloaded, it's a simple game. It has charming graphics, surprisingly funny voice acting and simplistic gameplay. You can have a lot of fun playing it, I would totally recommend buying the 4-pack and gathering some buddies to spend some time with, try out the different game mods, maps and everything else, you're going to laugh a lot on your first hours -- it's a blast.Sadly, as stated before, it's a simple game without that much to offer, you might start to get bored relatively quick and there isn't much we can do about it, especially if you've tried everything there is in it. I wouldn't recommend buying the game in its full price though, as I don't think it's worth the experience it provides.			",133,15,5,14,7,2,2

												Worm this way or don't Worm at all. The ultimate collection of the original annelid apocalypse, this showcase of guerilla wormfare will earn chuckles from even most hard boiled vets. It's dumb, explosive and forces the player to be prepared for anything from wind direction to the likelihood of your foe having some sort of exploding farm animal at their disposal. Play with friends gathered around your pc, play online with leaderboards and in-game achievements or just play vs computer (or yourself!). This game is a classic for a reason!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: August 29, 2016
TL;DR SUMMARY: This game is not bad at all - in fact, it's very solid and enjoyable, and the graphics are very pretty. But the gameplay is almost the same as Worms Armageddon/World Party, and while new elements are few and mostly cosmetic, a lot of elements (and weapons) from the older games have been removed or have been massively simplified in a bad way. Both older and newer parts of the series have a lot more to offer.FULL REVIEW: So, Worms Reloaded was the series' return to 2D after three 3D games (Worms 3D, Forts, and Mayhem), and as expected, the gameplay didn't change massively from the famed Worms Armageddon and World Party, but the graphics are much prettier, and there are should be some new ideas and innovations... right?Not really. Whether you're interested in playing multiplayer (most people, I guess) or single player (there's probably like 5 of us but we exist), the new elements are mostly details, while some significant classic elements are missing.Let's start with multiplayer. As I said above, the gameplay is more or less unchanged from WA/WWP. Probably the most remarkable innovation is that the maps can now also be vertically, rather than horizontally oriented (i.e. tall and narrow map instead of low and wide), which results in quite different gameplay. There can now also be randomly placed sentry guns (automatically fire at any worms that move) and electromagnets (which seem to only work for the first two turns or so, and therefore don't do much), that also alter the game a bit. There's the good old landscape generator and easy to use manual editor, plus plenty of maps from older Worms that you can use (although they're hidden under ""saved levels"", which is not very intuitive). No new premade maps with castles, flowers or frogs however, all there is in Reloaded is the generator. Besides regular games, there's also a forts mode and race mode.However, as I said, there's also a lot ""less"" - especially less customisation when editing game schemes, something like half of the options from the older Worms are gone (e.g. can no longer modify the power of weapons or how often they appear in crates, sudden death is only health drops to 1 and/or water rising, etc.). The ""Wormpot"" from Worms World Party/Worms 3D (which allowed for such craziness as permanent x2 damage or more slippery terrain) is not here either.But the biggest ""less"" are weapons - I think something like half of weapons from older Worms are gone, with only a handful of new (and not very spectacular) ones. Most of the crazy superweapons like the Ming Vase or Sheep Strike are gone, but there are also some unique weapons that have been removed with nothing to fill their niche - the most notable being probably the lack of both Minigun and Flamethrower, with no similarly powerful short range weapon to replace them. Another thing that bothers me is the lack of most utilities, like the classic Low Gravity and of course the amazing, wonderful cluster♥♥♥♥ creator: Damage x2 (if you've never used a Banana Bomb with Damage x2, you don't know life, I'm sorry). The only utility left is the Jet Pack (+ Laser Sight has survived using sneaky means, it can be enabled for shotgun as an option), while items such as the Ninja Rope - which is actually a bit harder to use here, a good change, in my opinion, now you actually need to decide between the rope and the jetpack, not ""rope gets you anywhere"" - or Girder now drop in utility crates instead.As for single player, of course the ""less weapons"" part also applies, but in this aspect Reloaded fails the most, in my opinion. The campaign here is... bare-bones basically, 3/4 are ordinary deathmatch games which only stop being tutorial-level difficulty about halfway through, and the remaining 1/4 try to be more classic ""puzzle"" kind of missions, but are also incredibly simplistic - the only genuinely cool and creative mission is the last, 30th one. If you've played the campaigns of older Worms (or especially the masterpiece that was the Worms 3D campaign), and thought a new, more modern engine would mean even cleverer and more intricate missions... nope.avi. A bit better is the Warzone mode, which is basically... also deathmatch, not much different from the campaign, but it does actually get more challenging later on. There's also a Body Count mode which is something actually new - a kind of ""survival"" mode, but there are no levels to choose from or any options to modify, you only choose the theme and that's it.And while we're at single player, the single biggest proof of laziness in Worms Reloaded - the AI. At first I wanted to say it's ""not that great"", but after playing for some time, the only way I have to describe it is pathetic. The AI either misses completely (most of the time with lower difficulties) or lands utterly ♥♥♥♥ing RIDICULOUS shots such as ""throw a grenade across the entire map which bounces off 4 surfaces into a narrow tunnel and lands under your worm's nose"" (this is NOT an exaggeration, I literally mean it). There is hardly ever anything in between, it pretty much doesn't ""hit but not direct hit"". It seems a tiny bit smarter in making decisions than the old AI, but also that old AI from the 90s did a better job at trying to emulate a human's accuracy and was about 5x more fun to play against, even if it only used like 5 basic weapons or so.On a more positive note, as I said, the graphics are very pretty - the game is very pleasant to look at and feels a bit more spectacular (even though most of the actually spectacular weapons are gone...). Bright and colourful themes are brighter and more colourful (Sports theme! <3 ), while dark and evil ones are darker and more evil. Besides that, there are some new cosmetic elements - when creating your team, you can choose your worms' skin colour and hat (yep, there's hats, and some are actually Team Fortress 2 references). But again, ""less""... Only 4 worms per team, end of story.So, that's about it. This is not a bad game at all - if this was the only Worms game ever released, I'd give it praise for being very good and a lot of fun (while also commenting there's a lot of unused potential...). But it's one of a dozen or so at this point, and it just pales in comparison with both the older and newer - whether it's multiplayer destruction and craziness you're looking for, or missions that require strategy and MacGyverish creative thinking, this game has a lot less of both. I just don't see a reason to pick Reloaded over Worms Armageddon/World Party or the newer installments, which seem to have actually contributed some new ideas to the series. (And I now feel sad having to give this game a ""not recommended"" rating.)			",23,1,0,0,1,0,4

												Never have I been this disappointed. This installment of Worms is just one of the worse ones out there. While the graphics is an improvement, the gameplay is underwhelming. The physics has been reduced and the worms somehow feel like they've gained 50 pounds. If you're brought to this game from Armageddon, I suggest staying with Armageddon because once you've played this game you'd wish you had wasted your precious time playing that installment of Worms.

												Clear warning, I'd only recommend this at around $5. The multiplayer is totally dead. I only see 1 game being played at any given time worldwide. This is sad. Reloaded was a genuine effort to blend Armageddon with modern sensibilities. It's still probably the best game for people with weaker systems but who want a solid update from Worms of old, without any drastic changes. I have a great system, and even the newer games like Clan Wars dont run perfect for me, like this game does. They really did a great job recreating the old sprites here. Unfortunately, without multiplayer, it's a weak experience. I gave up around mission 22 on the campaign, and none of the other solo content interests me. Such a shame. At the time, I really felt like this was Team 17's comeback. But hey, if you want to stay hardcore, Armageddon still has players online. Go with that.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

If there is something bad to say about the game, it would be that it didn't change much in terms of music and artstyle, It is just a fresher version of the old Worms.			",136,44,7,18,22,1,32

												Extremely Fun. A must purchase for anyone who played Worms games as a kid. For those who didn't, it is easy to get into. I was only expecting to play it briefly for a laugh. It totally got me hooked.It does come with a few negative points though:1) Some of the campain missions are annoyingly hard (the non fighting AI ones). 2) I bought this game to play together with my friend. Then I find out that PC owners can't play with MAC or linux. No cross platform/system matchmaking3) Multiplayer servers are also completely deserted on mac. This is a multiplayer game...4) Game crashes ocasionally on a mac.5) Some bugs too... Like having to wait 45 seconds after AI uses 2 rounds of shotgun ammunition.6) AI is crap. The Very Hard bots are easy to kill. Total Score would have been a 9.5/10. Subract 1 point for bugs/crashes. Subtract 1 point for lack of cross server multiplayer and half a point for deserted servers.Verdict: 7/10 - The main reason I am giving this a Thumbs down is becuase of lack of cross platform multiplayer.

												I do confess I haven't played the old Worms games much (a little bit of Worms 2, Armageddon and 3D afterwards) but I play this one a LOT.All the singleplayer modes are great for the times when I'm alone, e.g. while I'm travelling (runs smoothly on 2.5 year old notebook with Intel graphics), and the multiplayer for I-do-not-know-how-many-million-players is even better. Heck, they're Worms and they're really Reloaded - after all the 3D versions this one is finally back in 2D with graphics and physics of 21.-st century.Try the demo version and see for yourself - you'll love it.

												Worms Reloaded is the best WORMS game I have played yet. I always have it on at parties with a controller hooked up, and laughing as everyone blows themselves up in a vain attempt to claim victory is a fantastic experience. Solo, it's very much a puzzle game, but multiplayer in a party situation is where it really shines. With the cheap prices on steam and Worms Reloaded as the best soiree game since Mario Party, consoles can suck it.			",259,45,2,29,19,1,47

												Clear warning, I'd only recommend this at around $5. The multiplayer is totally dead. I only see 1 game being played at any given time worldwide. This is sad. Reloaded was a genuine effort to blend Armageddon with modern sensibilities. It's still probably the best game for people with weaker systems but who want a solid update from Worms of old, without any drastic changes. I have a great system, and even the newer games like Clan Wars dont run perfect for me, like this game does. They really did a great job recreating the old sprites here. Unfortunately, without multiplayer, it's a weak experience. I gave up around mission 22 on the campaign, and none of the other solo content interests me. Such a shame. At the time, I really felt like this was Team 17's comeback. But hey, if you want to stay hardcore, Armageddon still has players online. Go with that.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

												Worms Reloaded is, basically, another entry on the Worms franchise. Another completely fun entry, I should say. Yes, pretty much like every other Worms game out there, this game right here is packed with all the hilarious stuff you can expect when you give weapons, and voices, to worms. Pretty fun game to play with friends, and crush their dreams of winning. All the different game modes are really fun, and it has lots of customization for your worms, including hats, yes, you read that right, hats!

												After this wonderful mess, Team17 never found their way back to programming a worthwile worms episode. Quite frankly, all later 3D-versions had very little to no improvements over the classic Worms. Altough many debates circle around the better (read: unstoppable) usability of the ninjarope in armageddon and a bunch of missing game-options compared to its predecessor, Worms: Reloaded still holds the title of the last timeless classic in the worms legacy. There is no funnier way to see you and your friends fail. Period.80/100			",46,14,2,17,2,1,13

When you're playing with friends you all get to have a laugh when a shot goes terribly wrong or have respect for the perfect grenade toss.Try the demo, its the least you can do.

I think. Either way it looks like new worms, and feels like the old worms. It's great.Game includes time proven classics like: Holy handgranade, mines, hilarious remarks, and more...

												Ah Worms Reloaded. This game is easily one of the best Worms games made over the the entire series spanning over 15 years back to the original Worms game back in DOS. If you have never played a worms game here are the basics. You play on different teams against either the computer or others players. Each of you takes turn controlling a worm armed to the teeth with a variety of weapons, items and utilities which are used to dominate the battlefield and destroy your opppenent's worms. Some constants of the series has always been the turn-based combat, random generated levels and destroyable terrain making you change you tactics as you play the game. Pulling off that epic long range grenade throw with high wind hitting you enemies worm is classic.Worms Reloaded is easily the best 2D worms games made the PC and it still supported and has updated with quite a few free patches since I've bought the game as well as (4) newly added DLCs that will extend the life of the game even further.

												Some people may argue that Worms Armageddon is superior in some ways. And, after actually learning Armageddon's controls and spending a lot of time with it, I have to agree. I used to think this one was a lot more solid, too, and was the definitive Worms game in my eyes. But after playing a lot of Armageddon, once again, that has changed.  However, no one can argue that this one is a LOT more intuitive. You can use a gamepad if you want, and the keys are remappable for whatever method you're using. You aren't stuck having to look up the complicated and confusing controls of Armageddon on the internet (Though, they work pretty well once you know them. And they were actually quite easy to learn).The fact is that if you want to get into Worms, or get your friends into worms, this is the best way to do it, bar none.Also, Worms Reloaded is the best version of Worms 2: Armageddon. Don't settle for the less refined console releases. This game will run on whatever computer you have; you have no excuse.(Another thing to note, is that this game does have some features that Armageddon doesn't, though that works both ways; Armageddon has a lot of things Reloaded doesn't have either. If you enjoy this one, try Armageddon. And, you know.....vice-versa)			",424,109,5,36,25,7,32

												does not live upto armageddon. The transition from 2D graphics to 3D graphics were not executed well. While the environment is still 2D, the effects adopted 3D and it does not have the experience the original series offered. The weapons feel fairly weak compared to big explosion effects and the overall pace is very slow.The developers clearly do not know the reason why the customers enjoyed the previous franchise. While some graphic aspects were improved, overall experience took a step backward.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the Worms franchise. They are party games that perfectly mix skill and luck, and do it with such flair that even if you're coming dead last, you never really stop having fun with all the crazy weapons and situations that arise.Worms - Reloaded is I believe the ""newest"" iteration of this franchise, and I have to say that it isn't really the best... at least in terms of actually being a fun party game to play with friends.Lets go back a decade or so to the playstation one, the good old PSX. Worms World Party had just been released, and it was the most fun I could ask for on a disk-based entertainment system. Sure, the previous iteration ""Worms Armageddon"" had a fantastic campaign, awesome music, HILARIOUS cutscenes, but as a party game it immediately loses out because A NEW GAME HAS NOTHING UNLOCKED! No weapons, no cool teams, nothing. Just the most basic weapons and voice packs. World Party has everything unlocked from the very beginning, and that made it perfect. He stuck that mother in at a party and went to town on each other's worms.This is not a reason to hate on a game. Some people enjoy there being some challenge and unlockables to collect so you have a reason to play. Smash brothers brawl did this and was a huge hit... would the game have been better if everything was unlocked from the very beginning? Well... I think it would have, but it isn't my place to say.Worms reloaded is the exact same game you played ten years ago. It is exactly the same. Same graphics, same voice packs, same weapons (with a few new ones). We opened this game up to play at a LAN a few days ago, and were immediately disappointed to see that the concrete donkey, the holy hand grenade and the banana bomb were all disabled. Guitar hero learned after it's third iteration that players want everything available at the start, as gamers we no longer valued achievement over fun, we wanted to be able to put in a game and do everything that game allowed us to do. People still say guitar hero 3 was the apex before the series' downfall, thanks to it catering to the 'casuals' of the world. I disagree completely. Like it or not, casual gaming is here, and in many ways, it is better. Worms Reloaded is a brilliant casual party game, but it is nostalgia blind, catering to the completionists and achievement hunters of the world, which takes away from it, somewhat... but once again, that comes down to personal interpretation.I still reccommend this game, but if you're at a LAN and someone can emulate old playstation one games... World Party is still better.			",948,328,12,92,108,7,124

												The Worms series has long been held dear by its fans for its endearingly comical, cartoony and unconventionally turn-taken nature of battle, and in my personal regard, offers a gaming experience that I highly value and recommend as an ideal respite from the typically hectic shoot 'em up fare. Whenever I want to relax, have fun and enjoy a good few laughs dispatching foes without the pressure of real time vigilance demanded by first person shooters, Worms is most definitely where it's at.If you're new to Worms, Reloaded is perhaps the best iteration through which to get acquainted with this loveable series. It's visually crisp and vibrant whilst being effortless to run for the majority of systems, with gameplay that is unwaveringly slick and reponsive; a refined culmination of all the earlier iterations that adhere to the classic 2-D visual format.There's one prevalent trait of Worms games that makes them somewhat notorious - it's ever so easy to make a blunder, whether it's by virtue of throwing a grenade only to have it fall in the vicinity of an ally or even bounce right back at you; underestimating the amount of jetpack fuel required to reach your desired destination and then dropping like an ill-fated little stone; fumbling an ambitious attempt to ninja rope across a body of water and plopping straight into it - the list of both witnessed and hypothetical follies goes on, and this is a notable part of what makes Worms so pricelessly tide-turning and amusing although unsuitable for those excessively proud individuals who could never so much as poke fun at themselves!

Probably the worst worms game they've ever made.The graphics are different, the controls are stiff, overall it feels like the worms I used to play on my old Nokia 6280. This must've either been rushed, or made by completely different people.And The netcode is worse than in worms armageddon. In fact, everything about this game is worse than worms armageddon, which was made in 1999. All the voice banks and dialogue is recycled from 1999, to the point where there's actually less of it.Four out of ten, at best. Forget that this thing even exists.			",77,8,2,2,10,2,21

												UI/UX is a failure, it's near impossible to set up a game beyond preset match configurations. Teams are limited to 4 worms, some weapons seem to be locked unless you play and finish campaign (to get some in game currency and unlock them), useless hats.Worms Armageddon are still great and kicking, especially with official patches allowing to play in higher resolutions and adding Wine compatibility (works great on Linux, I just had to disable virtual desktop through regedit, which latest patch forces for game despite global Wine settings).Better get it instead of this abomination.Worms Reloaded seems to also not support cross-platform multiplayer.

Unfortunately, I have a Mac and those friends I want to play with all have PCs, and after a bit of reading in the troubleshooting forum it seems they have no interest in supporting cross-platform multiplayer.  I am EXTREMELY disappointed, as must cross-platform games that have multiplayer features seem to have no issue actually, ya know, allowing you to PLAY cross platform.  This is a huge oversight on their part, and even though I only payed less than $7 die to the holiday sale I would REALLY like my money back.			",30,10,1,7,14,3,7

												Great fun for you and some friends!Don't get the PC version to play with friends on the MAC version or visa versa!Randoms will leave when they are losing so the game is only worth it if you have  reliable friends to play with. The single player AI is obviously letting you win as it can never miss a shot if need be.Like Killing Floor, if you buy this for the single player aspect you will be disappointed as multiplayer is the best way to play this.Unlike older games in the series, you cannot add AI teams for online play (but you can for offline hotseat) which really cheapens online if you only have 1 mate on hand to play with.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews ",165,36,3,41,9,1,48

												Worms. It's a classic. It's been done, and re-done, and imitated.Reloaded is the real deal, though - a modern interpretation of World Party (from the DOS era, for those who know).That being said, there are some significant issues. There are Mac and Linux ports, but don't fool yourself - you can ONLY play with people who run the same OS as you. Yes, there are ""work arounds"" (if we're being honest, they're more like extreme measures) such as WINE and multi-booting. I'm told also that the DLC doesn't work on the Mac and Linux ports (at best) and may even cause the game to simply fail to run (at worst).This, combined with the apparently laissez-faire attitude of the dev team (which extends to the newer issuance in the series as well, it seems), makes this game (and other T17 post-1990s releases) a poor choice for your wallet-votes.

												Team 17 your development is ancient like my Amiga 2000 I bought 1987!!! I bought a 4 player pack to play with my friends and now I saw that Worms Reloaded have no crossplattform support in multiplayer mode!!! I using Linux and my friends Windows. Why in the hell you sell a multi plattform game if this game could not be played between Windows/Mac and Linux??? Sorry, I felt a little bit ripped off, because my intension was to support Linux. Now I need to use Wine which do a much better job than your Linux version that also has tiny display glitches.Best thing on the so called ""Cross Plattform Multiplayer"" category is that you need to create a filter while searching the Steam db to analyse if the game is capable of this option. Nobody who simply select Worms Reloaded is realizing that this game has no ""Cross Plattform Multiplayer"" option because in the game overview there is no display that identify that this game is not in the ""Cross Plattform Multiplayer"" catergory!I am pretty sure nearly nobody realize that a game that is playable on different systems is not able to connect to each other when it has some kind of party mode. To think about that there is a category for ""Cross Plattform Multiplayer"" Mode is much more anybody can expect from a normal customer.			",94,9,1,7,4,0,6

I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER WORMS GAME WITHOUT CHECKING FOR A WINDOWED MODE OPTION.It's a 2D game that is turn based, easy to pause, and has a lot of casual appeal. I should be able to read the news, watch youtube, and watch porn at the same time... all while blowing apart little worms with tiny bazookas. Damn you team17 for robbing me of that opportunity. I find this to be an untenable situation, and for this reason the game is unplayable. There was apparently a third party solution at one point, but a patch has broken the mod. My recommendation.. nah. Team17 needs to get there act together.  ",60,23,0,10,1,0,14

This is not one of the better ones. Way too many minor issues and functions and UI that are clearly not optimized, like the game haven't been play tested at all. That goes for most of the games.

												Good game with classic gameplay and alive multiplayer.Unfortunately developers are too lazy to make cross-platform (Windows-Linux-MacOS) multiplayer possible.This is bad because it splits already small playerbase.Also they don't care to make support for DLCs on Linux.Looks like they ditched the game and will never fix these issues.

												""Who is Mr. Plane?"", asked the Special Secrets Senior Detective Ron Power. Lil McSwinny shuddered and pondered for a moment. ""He is. . . . an enigma-"" Immediately, and intentfully, Ron Power destroyed McSwinny's jaw with an incredible right hook. ""I am not playing a game McSwinny. I am reality, I am force. And I demand answers."" McSwinny was already dead. Ron Power took one last drag from his Lucky Mike cigarette, flicked it onto the ground, and slammed the door behind him. ""October 12th, 1955, 11:48 pm."", Ron Power began, speaking into his write-o-matic voice memo machine that was mounted onto his wrist, ""McSwinny was a dead end. Only man left is Macrone, Tim Macrone. They call him Weak Tim, cos he has tiny baby hands. I've heard he's a real bad guy though, always committing crimes, lots of wrong-doing. He must know something about this mysterious Mr. Plane."" Detective Power pulled up to Weak Tim's hideout, deep within the urban garbage land that was Ultra New York City, PA. The guards were smashed within seconds of Ron Power's arrival. After punching through the locked metal door to Tim's private planning room, Ron revealed his comically oversized revolver and forced it into Weak Tim's forehead. ""Tell me everything you know about Mr. Plane, or else. . . . . I'll shoot you with my gun!"" Tim leaked♥♥♥♥♥♥onto the floor. ""Uh. . he. . . uh. . . . well, Mr. Plane is a really big red plane and it's like red baron pizza box with the guy on the box? You know like from world war one, it's like his plane.

												Well, it's a Worms title. The single player can be decent fun, and the multiplayer can be somewhat funny too against random people. However, as all Worms titles, make a unique game style (we like a banana/holy bombs combo) and play with a few friends and a guarantee a great time. Anyway, 19,99€ is still a high asking price for something that's not even close to new thinking - it should have been 9,99€ from the start, imho.			",2790,1141,113,311,383,38,429

												I was hoping this was the type of game I could just fire up for a quick tipsy couch-match against a buddy. Turns out not to be that kind of thing at all. I've actually tried to get into it a few times, but just... can't. The menus are overly complicated, the controls make no apparent sense, and I can't wrap my head around how turn progression works.Maybe it's a great game if you've already invested a bunch of time into mastering one of its predecessors. But as someone with no prior experience in the series, the learning curve is just stupidly steep for what I understand to be a relatively simple concept of wacky worm-teams in turn-based battle.If I recall there were some glaring menu bugs, and ""partial controller support"" should really say ""half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥controller support"", at least on Linux. Am I supposed to plug in multiple keyboards or something? Gimme a break.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, while I like the worms franchise this one does little to innovate or add anything new. If you want a better worms game buy Worms The Original trilogy on XBOX 360 (and maybe ps3) but the thing that pisses me off the most is the fact that you can't play against your friends, if they have a different computer (like Mac and PC) this annoys me due to the fact that I brought the game for my friend and I, I ain't getting a new computer just for Worms. So I will say get this if you want but if you want multiplayer get armagedan (that one's windows only and a little better)			",94,19,0,9,9,2,7

The controls are funky and unintuitive.- The price, €20 for a 6 year old game is a bit odd.- The game feels very unbalanced.- The variety of weaopns is nice, unfortunately you're better off using your standard weapon 90% of the time which kind of ruins the purpose of different weapons to a certain extent.

												Becoming old sucks.I first experienced Worms many years ago on the Amiga platform, and it was totally hilarious, but to be honest this reincarnation felt quite disappointing.Perhaps it is the overly cute graphics and sounds, additionally with the controls which feel ""fiddly"" that puts me off.The game menus are littered with options and slightly confusing navigation, together with weird additions such a ""shop"" (IAP?) doesn't make for a good impression.Now get off my lawn.

												I was hoping this was the type of game I could just fire up for a quick tipsy couch-match against a buddy. Turns out not to be that kind of thing at all. I've actually tried to get into it a few times, but just... can't. The menus are overly complicated, the controls make no apparent sense, and I can't wrap my head around how turn progression works.Maybe it's a great game if you've already invested a bunch of time into mastering one of its predecessors. But as someone with no prior experience in the series, the learning curve is just stupidly steep for what I understand to be a relatively simple concept of wacky worm-teams in turn-based battle.If I recall there were some glaring menu bugs, and ""partial controller support"" should really say ""half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥controller support"", at least on Linux. Am I supposed to plug in multiple keyboards or something? Gimme a break.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, while I like the worms franchise this one does little to innovate or add anything new. If you want a better worms game buy Worms The Original trilogy on XBOX 360 (and maybe ps3) but the thing that pisses me off the most is the fact that you can't play against your friends, if they have a different computer (like Mac and PC) this annoys me due to the fact that I brought the game for my friend and I, I ain't getting a new computer just for Worms. So I will say get this if you want but if you want multiplayer get armagedan (that one's windows only and a little better)			",94,19,0,9,9,2,7

												If you're looking for a modern Worms game, I'd personally recommend this one over Revolution or Clan Wars.The simplistic cartoon aesthetic, whilst not radically changed in later worms games, is at its finest in this game. It remains truly 2D rather than attempting to add depth with the 2.5D you find in Revolution and Clan Wars. This is just personal preference, but to me it makes the game feel far more... light. Reloaded doesn't try to be more than a lighthearted cartoony atmosphere, whereas Revolution and especially Clan Wars seem to try and add an aura of realistic detail to their themes, one that I personally don't feel matches the series.As far as gameplay goes, this one has the perfect balance between classic and modern play styles. The wide variety of weapons and the various themes leave little to be desired. Also, if you're like me and enjoy customising multiple teams and being able to control all of them on the battlefield, then this is the last game which allows you to do so easily. My main gripe with Revolution and Clan Wars is that the games seem to be tailored for multiplayer, in that you can have one team which has your Steam name as the default team name. You can make more, but the process of being able to play all of the teams yourself is an arduous one. Here in Reloaded, you can simply make as many teams as you wish and line them up to play, be they CPU controlled or player controlled.I'd also like to add that if you ever played the Open Warfare series on PSP or DS, Reloaded is essentially a heavily expanded version of that game. Hell yeah.			",336,70,35,49,31,5,31

												Introduction: Ten years on from Worms Armageddon and the turn-based comic mayhem continues in Worms Reloaded, an all-new edition available for PC through Steam. Worms Reloaded features up to four player online and offline multi-player, voice support, a raft of crazy new weapons and the return of some iconic weapons from the brand’s celebrated past.  We all know and love Worms, Worms Reloaded brings all we love and gives it a new lick of paint. Its all here from holy hand grenades to exploding sheep and even the odd poke for good measure. Story: There is no story per-say to worms, but it does feature a campaign mode that’s pretty comprehensive. Worms is simply about worms at war, there’s no rhyme or reason to it. But you will come to love your own group of worms. Worms has always oozed character and Reloaded is no different.Gameplay: If you have ever played Worms then nothing has changed, but if its not broken why fix it. Worms plays beautifully, even someone who hasn’t played before will soon be comfortable with the controls. In fact I put this to the test when reviewing it, we had a gaming night and after a few minutes my 8 year old had mastered the controls. For me that’s where Worms really shines, Its good to play on your own but even better with friends. There are very few games that span generations, but Worms achieves this as its loved by young and old alike.Presentation: The graphics looked great ten years ago and nothing has really changed, its still those loveable little guys brandishing heavy artillery. It wont push your system even without a discreet graphics card, but its all well drawn and looks great. Worms isn’t about amazing graphics, its about fun. The presentation is great and you really will love these little guys but Crysis its not, nor does it want to be. The animation is smooth and its visually appealing.If you want to read my full review and others visit http://cyberusuk.com ",188,33,5,26,15,1,16

												Master the ninja rope, master the bazooka, you are godly!Have played since Worms 2 on the PC and this game has always made me laugh.  There is a learning curve for what all the weapons/utilities do and how to best utilize them, and even then, depending on the wind and terrain, you may need to use them differently depending on how the game is going.The audio is halarious.  Listening to the Worms responses (the death ones especially), cracks me up!  Love the randomly generated terrain.  High replayability!!  Play this with friends if you can, it makes for a great bunch of laughs.Game is fairly straightforward.  Your team of worms vs. enemy team of worms.... first one to eliminate the enemy team wins!

												I LOVED Worms World Party back in the day.Man, if this game would be just WWP in HD, I would cry rainbows.Sadly, it is not.Awful ""physics 2.0"" of this game include: worms slipping off high-elevated surfaces in annoying manner; grenades sticking to worm's head when flying on warp-speed and slipping off when put carefully; horrible airstrike, where one rocket displaces others on explosion; increased worm-surface friction - if a worm travels at the speed of light and touches a pixel of a ground, it stops like they are both made of velcro.Other awesome changes are: increased knockback where it was fine (remember how cool it was to stomp a worm into the hell with a donkey? Forget it - worm will fly away or stick to the abyss wall due to friction after first donkey punch);decreased knockback where it was fine, too - sweet dragonballs and fire punches are much less sweet now, prod should be removed at all, and earthquake is very predictable;decreased weapon damage - dynamite, sheep, old woman, HHG are just not the same fun they used to be. Grenade was always considered to be a more skilled weapon than bazooka - why do they damage equally, then?ninja rope is very difficult to handle in many cases now;worms and delayed blast weapons sometimes get stuck in really wide map corners.no flamethower. seriously, it was awesome weapon;Overall, I still manage to get certain fun off playing this, but there is still a lot of flaws, and sadly, they are considered to be advantages.

												Worms Reloaded is an undisputed classic and deserves that accolades it originally received.  However, this update is nothing short of a lazy port and hasn't been optimised for the Steam platform.The multiplayer options are non-existent.  Instead of creating a range of modes for gamers to choose from there's just a lazy ""search"" option for games, which makes it impossible to find and play casual games with and against your Steam friends.  This is a bitter disappointment as re-living this classic with some good banter between friends was a real driver for paying for it in the first place.Nothing to do except uninstall it now.

												I LOVED Worms World Party back in the day.Man, if this game would be just WWP in HD, I would cry rainbows.Sadly, it is not.Awful ""physics 2.0"" of this game include: worms slipping off high-elevated surfaces in annoying manner; grenades sticking to worm's head when flying on warp-speed and slipping off when put carefully; horrible airstrike, where one rocket displaces others on explosion; increased worm-surface friction - if a worm travels at the speed of light and touches a pixel of a ground, it stops like they are both made of velcro.Other awesome changes are: increased knockback where it was fine (remember how cool it was to stomp a worm into the hell with a donkey? Forget it - worm will fly away or stick to the abyss wall due to friction after first donkey punch);decreased knockback where it was fine, too - sweet dragonballs and fire punches are much less sweet now, prod should be removed at all, and earthquake is very predictable;decreased weapon damage - dynamite, sheep, old woman, HHG are just not the same fun they used to be. Grenade was always considered to be a more skilled weapon than bazooka - why do they damage equally, then?ninja rope is very difficult to handle in many cases now;worms and delayed blast weapons sometimes get stuck in really wide map corners.no flamethower. seriously, it was awesome weapon;Overall, I still manage to get certain fun off playing this, but there is still a lot of flaws, and sadly, they are considered to be advantages.

												Out of the last few Worms games released, this one is still pretty good. It's a bit cut down from Armageddon but still runs nicely on lower-end systems, more than can be said for Revolution and onwards. The single-player is complete balls thanks to the AI (as it has more or less always been in Worms), but it's still a perfectly valid party game, and with the exception of the occasional hiccup, works pretty well online. There's no real reason to get any of the DLC except maybe Forts if you're really into that mode, just grab the base game on sale sometime.			",613,127,18,38,40,4,51

												DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME! YOU CAN ONLY PLAY ONLINE MULTIPLAYER! THERE ARE NO PEOPLE PLAYING ONLINE! I was so looking forward to playing this at home with a few of my friends like we currently do with worms armageddon. You can't play single player AND you cant play versus either and make teams you can save, adjust the computer ai, anything that made this game great IS NOT IN IT!! If I could somehow get a refund I would be very very happy as this is a dead game in my library and will never get played. A little tip for the developers... You had something great and you took it all away! Put the things that made this a great game back in it and I guarantee you will have sales! I thought this was going to be THAT game, it definitely was not but hey worms armageddon is still great! :)- Silky Johnson			",13,2,0,3,1,0,2

												This game is awesome. My girlfriend loves playing it too, which is great since she's not a gamer. Sometimes I'll ask her if she wants to play Worms and she'll grab my worm or pull out her worm instead. Would reccommend 11/11 since 1s look like worms			",109,26,1,8,6,3,10

												This is probably the best version of this game that I have ever played. The controls are great and responsive, the weapon array is vast and fun, and the game has the typical modes you would expect from a Worms title. This game is the version that was on the 360 under a different name and I am glad I took the time to research this as I have played other versions and either don't like the control or the style they are presented in. You will find the most fun with this version.			",31,11,0,21,3,0,4

Before I get into it, I must say, ($20 is just plain crazy to pay for it, I payed $4, do not pay any more than $5 for it.So it's just like the mobile game, just two different weapons and more game modes and styles. Utterly a great game. Worst part is now, the mobile version is so boring. There is alot of customization options for everything. I love the custom team creating.

TL;DR ""Anything less than a SteamOS version of Worms DC (Amiga 1200 AGA, and perfectly playable in FS-UAE:) just tastes like ashes in my mouth.""IMO Worms DC is by far the most superior of all the Worms series in all aspects, and I have experience with a few other versions of the franchise. And I am of the firm opinion that anything less than the Directors Cut is just plain hearts!The only way I could possibly describe this better would be ""The fact that there is a Steam version of the MS-DOS version, but not Amiga AGA DC version is just plain hearts. Why did Team 17 have to go hearts with hearts original stupid bloody hearts hearts!""Just like with potato chips and energy drinks I canot emphasise just how many hearts it might take to adequately express just how poor the modern versions taste when compared to the original flavour.Original creator Andy Davidson is a mad genius who created a brilliant game, and Team17 have done what one might expect a major publisher to do with the project and ♥♥♥♥ed with it just because they can, and have effectively perverted the original game beyond all playable recognition. I don't even know where to begin when it comes to describing all the negative changes that have been added over the years to this entire franchise. I would both buy and rate the ♥♥♥♥ out of the game Worms: The Directors Cut if they could make a SteamOS compatible version, but otherwise I suggest you just download the HDF file (for use in UAE:) for free anyway. Sure it has no online multiplayer, but then neither does this game really if you consider how likely you are to find someone who actually want to play a game against you. And seeing as how it's an establish franchise I think that fact speaks volumes.Mild and inoffensive one player mode saves this from being terrible. 7/10			",181,43,4,11,11,0,12

												Some games never get old. This is basically a ""reVamped"" version of the timeless classic Worms 2. The core of the game is unchanged (actually a positive thing), and the multiplayer remains a fabulous experience both for newcomers and veterans. Now running on an engine allowing easy access, zoom function (which is a very nice touch) and running on all modern machines. There could be more Single-Player missions (and more interesting ones), as well as new game modes, but overall it is a great bang for buck! Especially if you're new to the series.

												I've loved the Worms series ever since I played Armageddon back in the day of Pentium IIs. This is a badly needed reboot of the classic worms gameplay, and quicky becoming one of my favorte games. Well worth the $10 if you like this kind of game. ^_^			",136,48,1,8,10,2,7

												It's worms. If you have any love for worms then  you will (should?) have love for this. It doesn't change or add anything remarkable but that's not a bad thing. If you own Worms, World Party then it may not be a necessary purchase other than for the convenience of it being on Steam.			",359,103,11,39,24,3,49

												The first great worms game since the first.All those years ago I sunk hundreds of hours into Worms - back in the days when multi-player meant you and some mates sat at a table together.  Rage Quitting meant throwing your controller at the floor and stomping out of the room.  Good times.Subsequent Worms titles didn't hold my attention at all, and with each new iteration I felt that a piece of the soul was missing.With Reloaded, however, I found myself back in love with the game.  Tight play areas, clever mechanics, and some fun new weapons make for a well-balance, exciting party game.Of course these days MP is done online as much as locally, which in a way is a shame, but this game does it so well, with barely any wait time between turns, and with the right people sets up some great vendettas.

												It's Worms with weapons. Seriously, what's not to like? Worms Reloaded is essentially a more updated version of Worms: Armageddon with multiplayer. This is a hilarious and fun strategy game that you can play with up to 3 others. You have a team of worms with an array of weapons including a bazooka, grenades, shotgun, holy hand grenades, giant donkey statues, old ladies, ferrets, sheep, and many other weapons. Yes, you can use old ladies and sheep as weapons. If you haven't played this game, yet. I highly recommend you jump on it. Worms Reloaded is currently the best game in the Worms franchise.

												Really fun little game :3. The thing that really bugged me was the multiplayer. The multiplayer was EXTREMELY slow and EXTREMELY buggy for the most part and I sorely wished you could play co-op against bots online. Oh, and the AI will always find SOME way to hit you even on easy. I had a grenade bounce off about 15 surfaces to hit me directly on the other side of the map.If you like worms, then you'll probably like this. Just don't buy it for the multiplayer.

												It LOOKS like the Worms: Armageddon remake we've been waiting for for years... and it very nearly is. Problem is, this is a console port, and it shows. The UI is buggy and oversimplified, obviously designed for use with a control pad rather than mouse and keyboard. The controls in-game are just plain awful (no mouse aim... I need to say that twice: NO MOUSE AIM) and can't be re-bound (seriously?)A couple more minor complaints: firstly, the levels are too small. It's obviously going for the same size maps as W:A, but that was designed for older systems that didn't have the resources for huge battles; it's 2014 and I have 2GB of VRAM, let me have my 20-on-20 worm-war. Secondly, it's rather annoyingly DLC-heavy, and while the game is still fun without any of it, I wish it wouldn't promote itself quite so much. I've already bought your game, and I want to see it, not ads.Other than that, it's pretty fun, and it could still be fantastic, if the devs ever decide to get off their asses and patch it into a real PC version. But controls can make or break a game, and in this case, they broke it hard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A truly fascinating and enjoyable experience marred by interface issues. If you have 'Worms Armageddon' or 'Worms World Party' I'd give this a skip as the changes are purely cosmetic and the interface is as unfunctional as using salami for mosquito repellant.However, if you can look past this obvious flaw, the online community is alive, barely, and should be just good enough to hold your attention once you've completed the single player and have had enough of wiping out AI teams on very hard, which is actually very easy. 7/10			",98,28,0,27,7,0,26

												This game may not bbe as perfect as the classic Worms series (Worms: Armageddon, Worms 1 and 2, and Worms World Party), but it still has some charm in to it. If you're a HUGE fan of Worms who likes the 2d version better than the 3D one, then get this! Even they released the ""retro"" DLC which makes you feel the nostalgia of playing the classic worms games, but not as excactly as you remember it. XDOverall good strategy-based gameplay and I would recomended. ^^			",169,24,1,19,4,3,13

												Perhaps one of the best in the series, smooth-gameplay (when it lags in MP, gameplay doesn't slowdown; instead, it briefly pauses and then continues the game at full-speed. Lag is also somewhat rare, and usually lasts 4 seconds max, after a player turn, which is actually somewhat useful for more time in your strategic planning), wacky, unique weapons, Worms classics such as the grenade,shotgun, and uzi,as well as tons of customizations! (literally).So buy yourself a copy today, or Saxton Hale will show up at your doorstep tommorow at 6:66 (you will know if something is amiss, just look at the time!)			",46,2,2,2,1,1,3

												Sad to say, but Worms Armageddon is still the pinnacle of the Worms franchise and every instalment afterwards has just been one step backwards after another.Like so many other titles these days, the game seems to be optimised for console gaming to the detriment of the pc gaming experience. A.I. in the single player campaigns are either idiots who blow themselves up or masterminds that can put a grenade under your nose from across the stage without blinking. As if this all wasn’t annoying enough, everything has been reduced, less weapons, less speech banks, less victory sounds, etc….but hey, you can now have a fort and a hat…Bottom line, instead of getting this, get yourself Worms Armageddon and you’ll be blowing up worms to your delight for months to come.

												""OI, Nuttah!"" Worms is one of the mainstays of the 'artillery game' genres, alongside Scorched Earth and Gunbound. True to the nature of the genre, Worms has everything an artillery game needs: response and easy-to-use controls, a colorful atmosphere, a sense of humor, and weapons. Lots of weapons. Definitely a great little casual game, one where you can afford to sit down, play a couple of rounds, and laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off watching annelids carry bazookas, fire shotguns, and scream like little girl worms when a grenade lands right next to them. This game is by no means serious, and if you can handle a game which laughs at itself while they try to blow the crap out of you, pick this one up. Your worms are surprisingly cusomizable, and there is a game mode for everyone, from the crazy survival-mode Rambos to the challenge-map experts. Of course, not much else compares to blowing up friends, since games like these were born for multiplayer. Find a buddy, gear up, and  lock and load...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty fun Turn Based game - I never played the originals so this is all new to me.  I find the humor and weapons to be fun and entertaining.  However the later levels in the campain require precise controls.... and well for me:  I found the controls in this game to be quite poor.  Jumping is awkward, moving is slow, jetpacks are jumpy and aiming to the skill level the AI has is pretty hard.  All that being said: Fairly old school turn based combat on a 2D platform scale.

												This is a fun puzzle/strategy type game in the mold of lemmings. I vote it down though for one reason and that is the lack of instructions on all aspects of the weapons. When trying to solve puzzles it is extremely frustrating to have your efforts hampered through lack of knowledge on what certain weapons are capable of.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely amazing game.The maps are amazing as well as the variety of different backgrounds for the maps you don't load in. I know you can do this in a lot of worms games but I love how you can name your worms. The voices are amazing and I can't help but laugh at some of them. A good mix of serious and silly. The hats amd graves are the same. There is a wide variety.The campaign is good as it isn't just battle but other skills as well like jetpack and ninja rope. The gradual increase in difficulty in the campaign is well done.			",9,2,0,8,2,0,4

												CAUTION! - Check game stability at time of purchase.First I will say I use to like these games. But for some untold reason I was able to get 2  of the Worms games(bundle of 8? games) to run better than 1-3 fps at the main menu. Spent a good hour on forums and google trying to find a fix and nothing seemed to work. Strongly recommend installing and testing the game at time of purchase so you can get a refund if the game does now work correctly. I am running Win7 Pro 64bit, i7 3.6ghz, Geforce 960 and 16gb ram. All drivers up to date. Devs say it should run fine on win7, but no support for Win8.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty much a straight downgrade from the classic 2D Worms games.It has fewer weapons, fewer voice options, fewer maps, (subjectively) inferior art, and atrociously oversized UI, as if it was designed to be played on a tiney smartphone screen. On top of all that, crossplatform multiplayer is missing, so good luck finding any online matches if you're on Linux or Mac.You may have fun with the game if you're willing to ignore all the shortcomings, but I see no reason to prefer it over Worms 2/Armageddon/World Party or Hedgewars.

												Worms has always been a great series of games. Friends are very recommended to get the most bang for your buck. I have played against a developer in a previous game before and it was just me and him. We were both low health and I had barely anything to throw at him. It was his turn and he said ""Sorry"" and put down a bunker buster onto me. It was an event that took place on Xbox Live.			",163,9,3,7,9,2,10

												I'm just gona write a list of pros and cons with a short review.CONS:1. Can't finish the main campaign because you need to purchase the last missions in the ""Shop"" and the ""Shop"" Doesnt actually exist in the game.2. The DLC is just a bunch of campaign packs that should of been bonus content in the game already.3. did i mention the SHOP DOESNT EXIST?PROS:1. Gameplay is awsome2. Can hitup straight into multiplayer and have fun3. Fully customizable gamemodes, altho the layout for selecting weapons is pretty shocking :PWell i can reccomend buying the game if its on sale with all the DLC or you can just get it souly for the multiplayer, but dont expect the single player experince to rock your socks. it feels a bit cheap and or not finished without the DLC. Also main campaign isnt fully beatable since the last 5missions require this ""Shop"" that doesnt exist. Thanks for reading and i hope this was helpful :)			",75,4,0,7,4,1,25

												It is a good return of 2D gameplay of Worms for the nowadays computers. Fans of the MS-DOS Worms games, Worms 2, Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party will enjoy Worms Reloaded. The con I have is the very high price for the game's longevity: after doing the normal missions, there's nothing much to do except to aim for achievements and playing online/offline with friends. So if you want it very badly, wait for sales, and you'll catch it by less than 10€. There are DLC content/packs available, so you'll be forced to get these if you are a big fan of the game series, and you are looking for more longevity. The packs are also a bit expensive, that's why I also recommend you to also wait for sales where you can find the packs by less than 2€ (But you can get a pack of all the packs for around the same price also in sales). This said, it is a good game for the fans, but you'll be forced to get the DLC content if you are looking for longevity.			",23,7,0,6,3,1,8

												It's kind of hard to describe Worms if you don't already know what it is.I guess it's a turn-based shooter? Where you control a team of cute cartoon worms? Also, everything's 2D and the super-simple environments are all completely destructible? I can't get any more specific than that.The real gist of it is though, if you get a few friends who all play this with you, you'll all be laughing and yelling at each other over crazy grenade throws and how the wind ♥♥♥♥ed up the bazooka shots, and then all laugh at the stupid overpowered items that destroy the whole stage.Reccommended.

												played it once and really enjoyed it. the problem is getting it to connect with your friends it is either a terrible port from console to pc or extremely bugger. the problem is not to do with the game but getting to that stage. connecting to the game when you join a game it says downloading game type or something of the sort even if your using the defaults! when you ready up it does not ready up on the host device or tell that device.and generally just trying to get it connect is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's the classic Worms formula, so TL:DR it's a fantastic artillery game and you should definitely buy it.Most of what needs to be said about this game alone has already been said, I'm just going to outline the differences between this and Worms: Armageddon.Pros:Steam integration, easy to set up a multiplayer game and play with friends. Also Steam Cloud saves!Nice graphics that are definitely a step up from Armageddon's ageing '98 256-colour look. Now with cute dancing animations!UI is a bit clunky but much MUCH better than Armageddon's.Enhanced level generator capable of generating more types of levels.Many of the weapons have been streamlined and are easier to use.New customisation options for pimping your teams.New speech banks, while keeping some of the classic Armageddon banks. (it only gets feta!)Integrated speech bank editor.Cons:Only matchmaking, no WormNET/Servers. Online community is dead, go get Armageddon if this is what you want.No LAN support...Generally less weapons/items than Armageddon. (some of them I don't miss)Doesn't seem to be a way to make maps out of images.No cross-platform multiplayer (can't play a game with a copy for a different OS), which doesn't affect me since all my friends use Windows.AI is even worse now. It either does something really stupid or it pulls off a shot with perfect accuracy, even on the lowest difficulty (tends to do more of the latter on higher difficulties).Custom speech banks are not synced by Steam Cloud.Not as much modding support as Armageddon.No Whoopsie speech bank :C (I'll come back y'know!)Some of the content is locked behind DLC, which isn't the case with Armageddon.Overall, I recommend this game to newcomers to the series and people who just want to play with their friends. People who would rather join the Worms community will be better off purchasing Armageddon instead, so long as they can put up with its age. ",317,45,4,22,18,2,30

												An awesome ""restart"" for a franchise in the only right way - 2D.It was a blast when the game was actually released, people were playing it, but not now unfortunately, multyplayer is a wasteland,  game is abandoned.But let's hope Worms World Party will recreate same spark as this game did, at least for a certain time.

												It has been years since I have played a game from the Worms line and if I recall correctly, it was on a sega Dreamcast. The moment I got into a battle it all came back to me, the fun, the humor, the strategy and the one liners from the worms. If you just want something that is entertaining with a bit of challenge, then this is for you.			",577,161,36,71,78,10,92

												Classic Worms. I'm sure almos everybody remember's these guys..This is the original Worms: Reloaded game, but with online and steam integration.Nothing much have changed, which is a good thing, because the original was an amazing game. It's still played in the classic 2D world, so no need to fear.It's probably not a game you'll play hours on end. But, if you're anything like me, it's a game you fire up once in a while because you just don't know what to do, so you might as well blow some worms up with a bazooka..It's up to 4 player vs. i believe, it has loads of challenge maps, and it never gets old.The Map generator is working great, and it also allows you to save and load custom maps.The dialog is, as always, witty and cute. Almost making you feel bad for blowing them up, until they shoot back..It's a great game, and it will give you some great fun.I can only recommend this game to anyone, and if you've never tried a Worms game before, you're really missing out.

												My note 7/10 - It's a Worms game that in my opinion works pretty well for having some fun with friends or even against the AI. It's not a countless playing hours game because it gets a bit boring if you play it too much time at once. I think it's a perfect game to burn some time by playing 3 or 4 matches a day.

												Another really fun addition to the Worms Franchise. When I was young, I used to love the game ""Scorched Earth"". The worms series is the closest thing in modern gaming to that one. This installment brings back practically all the classic silly humor you've come to expect from the series. Unfortunately, it's best as a multi-player game. The AI tends to be a bit lackluster at times. but it's still a fun little way to spend your time.			",12,7,0,10,9,1,1

												Some games never get old. This is basically a ""reVamped"" version of the timeless classic Worms 2. The core of the game is unchanged (actually a positive thing), and the multiplayer remains a fabulous experience both for newcomers and veterans. Now running on an engine allowing easy access, zoom function (which is a very nice touch) and running on all modern machines. There could be more Single-Player missions (and more interesting ones), as well as new game modes, but overall it is a great bang for buck! Especially if you're new to the series.

												I love worms. It's funny, entertaining, teaches some skills in problem solving, It's one of the few games i can play with my 5 year old son, and we both enjoy it. Worms Reloaded... Still the worms i used to know, but on lowest graphics settings still lags like hell on a lenovo t400 with 2 gigs of ram. A 2d game lagging? WTH, really? Running fine with highest settings on my 5y old desktop pc though.			",11,0,1,1,1,0,3

												Yes, it's Worms at heart - 'wacky' weapons and silly worm customisation (including a variety of voices and headgear) but the gameplay has a horrible problem.The DLC is not worth buying in the slightest; the 'Forts & Hats' DLC is akin to paying money for hats in Team Fortress, and the 'Forts' DLC is essentially two opposing teams on islands, with one or more objectives between 'defend this worm', 'attack this worm', 'collect this item' and 'eliminate enemy'.  Gave up on the Puzzle DLC after four levels of tedium.The AI in the single player is the worst offender. Even on the easiest difficulty, it seems that all enemy worms are capable of throwing a grenade through the most improbable gap and hitting you square in the face regardless of wind speed or obstacles, and it is ♥♥♥♥ING. TEDIOUS. Restarting a level over and over because the AI is impossible to beat is not fun at all. Don't buy this. Buy the original Worms instead - they may only be a few pixels across, but they don't suck.			",347,87,7,30,37,5,70

I've played since Worms 1 and I think this is a great buy: its worms, its HD, its on Steam, and its a hell of a lot easier to get running on a modern system than Armageddon.Edit: No longer the best post-armageddon Worms game. Get Revolutions or Clan Wars and skip this.			",486,132,11,76,48,4,73

												Hallelujah! The Worms are back in yet another game, but fear not - there's little attempt for risky innovation here, no this is a simple amalgamation of ideas that Team 17 proved worked 10 years ago. Yes, Worms Reloaded can be considered to just be Worms Armageddon +, and in many ways this is right. The premise is exactly the same, the weapons are exactly the same (save for a few new ones), the physics, humour, & the modes which people will be spending 90% of their time are exactly the same. However, this is really refinement at it's best. The new bells and whistles make this incarnation of Worms into a 2010 and beyond experience. Seamless Steamworks support, achievements, HD sheen and interface, DLC, and tons of customizability mixed with the proven gameplay is the perfect molotov cocktail to keep you still coming back for more.

												If you've been gaming for any significant length of time, you've probably played one iteration of Worms or another. The original game was released in the days of yore, when tweaking your system amounted to fiddling with your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to get sound working. Over the years, Team 17 had released dozens of sequels and spinoffs, to varying degrees of success.Worms Reloaded takes the classic gameplay and adds new weapons and game modes such as Puzzles. Most of the improvements are found in the high-rez sprites and Internet multiplayer, with the core gameplay remaining unchanged. Think of the game as a definitive version for playing online against friends (or enemies).The game has also been ported to OS X, but the port is incompatible with its Windows counterpart. Unless you already have some friends who game on Apple machines, your chances of finding a match online are pretty much nil. Since the single-player mode is basically training for online play, skip the port if you care about multiplayer at all.			",89,23,1,10,4,1,25

												The first great worms game since the first.All those years ago I sunk hundreds of hours into Worms - back in the days when multi-player meant you and some mates sat at a table together.  Rage Quitting meant throwing your controller at the floor and stomping out of the room.  Good times.Subsequent Worms titles didn't hold my attention at all, and with each new iteration I felt that a piece of the soul was missing.With Reloaded, however, I found myself back in love with the game.  Tight play areas, clever mechanics, and some fun new weapons make for a well-balance, exciting party game.Of course these days MP is done online as much as locally, which in a way is a shame, but this game does it so well, with barely any wait time between turns, and with the right people sets up some great vendettas.

												The PC controls take awhile to get used to, and if you've played one version of Worms you've played 'em all. That said, the turn-based ridiculousness is still so much fun it's hard to resist playing just...one...more...game.

												""It's worms, Jim... but not as we know it""Give the demo a spin. This is, thankfully, one of those games that you'll probably know pretty quickly if you'll enjoy or notFor me - I'm afraid this has to get a thumbs down. It was the first Worms outing for Steam, and repaying homage to the 2D classics of Worms; but has curiously seemed to have taken a step backwards. Quite frankly, if you want good a 2D venture  - Worms Armageddon is the one to get!The mechanics are largely identical to the classics. They've added a few new interesting weapons (such as the Sentry Gun / Bunker Buster) but by the same hand have taken away several good'uns too (French Sheep Strike, Homing Pigeon, minigun...) - which I find a very perculiar choice to have made. I find the worms also look visually worse than before; and the menu is also quite drab and clunky (lots of text, several levels of sub-menus and no tool-tips) The campaign is also very disappointing and lacks the puzzles / challenges we saw beforeQuite frankly - Now that the more formidable Worms Armageddon is back on Steam (and remastered): Get that one instead!

												If you thought earth worms couldn't exciting, you were wrong. Worms Reloaded is the critically acclaimed game of 2010, pinning up worm against worm in combat to the death, using many of the weapons of mass destruction which we were unable to find in Iraq, such as the banana bomb. With literally thousands of different ways to move your worm, you will spend the large majority of your time on this game watch the enemy try to jump up on the ledge even though they can just ninja rope up there.

												This is arguably one of the best worms games to come out in ""recent"" years. It sticks to the classic 2D formula that people have grown to know and love without fundamentally messing up the mechanics of what makes this game so great! The new weapons are a great addition to go along with some of everyone's favorite classic ones. They add some new options for destroying your enemies or friendly worms. Not to mention, the famously ridiculous ninja ropes are still going strong in this game. :)I've owned this game for several years now and feel it has aged very well. The 2.5D (3D models on a 2D plane) worms games are fun in their own way, but something just feels “off” about them in comparison. Maybe it’s because I grew up playing Worms World Party.I own just about every worms game on steam and I've got to say that I always find myself going back to Worms Reloaded to play with friends when we all feel like enjoying some unique and infinitely fun multiplayer.Do yourself a favor and pick this game up the next time it goes on sale, or even full price if that is your style.

												It LOOKS like the Worms: Armageddon remake we've been waiting for for years... and it very nearly is. Problem is, this is a console port, and it shows. The UI is buggy and oversimplified, obviously designed for use with a control pad rather than mouse and keyboard. The controls in-game are just plain awful (no mouse aim... I need to say that twice: NO MOUSE AIM) and can't be re-bound (seriously?)A couple more minor complaints: firstly, the levels are too small. It's obviously going for the same size maps as W:A, but that was designed for older systems that didn't have the resources for huge battles; it's 2014 and I have 2GB of VRAM, let me have my 20-on-20 worm-war. Secondly, it's rather annoyingly DLC-heavy, and while the game is still fun without any of it, I wish it wouldn't promote itself quite so much. I've already bought your game, and I want to see it, not ads.Other than that, it's pretty fun, and it could still be fantastic, if the devs ever decide to get off their asses and patch it into a real PC version. But controls can make or break a game, and in this case, they broke it hard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worms never gets old. But it has been a damn long time since Armageddon was released, and there was room for improvement. So improve they did. Reloaded is a remake of Armageddon / World Party, with better community functions, well-done graphic modernization and some careful innovation. If anything, it is even more of a party game than before. One of the best game remakes I ever saw.			",180,23,4,34,12,1,71

												At its heart this game is the same as the original worms but with many, many improvements. The graphics are immeasurably better, there are more entertaining weapons and customisation however it still has the bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy controls (but you can now customise them now). They have obviously put a lot effort into making the single player game better but it has not really worked as the AI is not very good. It either does perfectly aimed shots that a human couldn't do or stupid shots that have no chance of being successful. So just like the original the fun lies in the mayhem of multiplayer games.

												Worms Reloaded posiada klasyczną esencję pastelowej dwójki i dodatków w podwyższonej rozdzielczości grafiki. Twórcy nie próżnowali i uraczyli nas nowymi brońmi czy mapami, które zawsze dodawały grze charakteru swa komiksowością. Małym, acz ciekawym urozmaiceniem są czapki dla naszych robaków, do tej pory znane wyłącznie z trójwymiarowych odsłon serii. Worms Reloaded to doskonała pozycja na zimowe wieczory z dziewczyną czy kumplami, wtedy, gdy na dworze mróz i śnieżyca a humor nam nie dopisuje. Gwarancja zabawy gwarantowana! Polecam.

												Worms Revolution, (I mean Reloaded)Batter up! This ones an odd one. Worms has allways been a fav of mine. This game standing alone from the others is good in the sense that it has the customary augented graphics and UI and expanded arsenal. It also retains classic qualities like sudden death and the forts which gives it wallop too. In addition there are customization featues that are alot of fun like hats, forts, the ability to name worms (Which never gets old despite it well, being old) and the new and hilarious voice tweaks. For me this is the best thing about this game, the best thing since in the very first version you could use paint to draw a new type of grave stone for your team. Leading to inevitable innuendo like phallic tombstones for example, and more sinister ones like a caricature of my own face. Anyway the goods on this late edition is the fact you can biuld your own sound bank of replies and comments to add to a team. This is a very tedious process I warn you, but ultimately immensely rewarding. I only managed it with online convertion software and an infernal production line of file management to get together an array of voices to fit the teams. And it took days, actual days! But by the nine was it worth it! However apart from this you won't see alot of useful new features and the game runs and feels like World Party did making it in my mind a 5 out of 10. But with its ability to add voices recorded of yourself or some other nutter to its characters this beast gets much wilder with a final mark of...6/10			",36,0,0,4,2,0,8

It has EXPLODING SHEEP, HOLY HAND GRENADES and JETPACKS.			",69,5,4,7,3,1,6

OLD LADIES ? of course old ladies ! watch her walk and explode... but it's funny because it is a worms game... in real life I'm not so sure it would be as funny...Think about buying a more recent worms game... but if you're aiming for that one go ahead !

Basically the game keeps everything great you have seen for the past 10 years, and adds some other weapons as well as some game modes. The best thing is, Worm Reloaded supports multiplayer via Internet up to 4 players. Undoubtly Worms Reloaded is the best Worms game to date.			",308,63,11,34,19,3,61

												WARms Reloaded is an epic struggle of war and sin as seen through the eyes of four worms that you recruit as you battle your way to global Internet domination by shooting, gassing, and blowing apart your enemies with impunity in deadly environments like lava filled caves and New York City. Love and frag your enemies, knowing that they'll do the same (If you didn't already get that Airstrike). 8/10 (The puzzle maps are overly eccentric but the costumization makes up for it)			",147,7,1,19,13,2,17
