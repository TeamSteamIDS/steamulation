												This standalone full-conversion mod is a Real-time Strategy (RTS) which utilizes the commander feature much like in the Battlefield™ series.  The commander sits at the helm constructing buildings as with any RTS while his faction-members carry out squad-based tasks, and perform duties required of their class. Play as one of two factions with slightly differing attributes, but with a wide array of tactical vehicles, defenses, customizeable loadouts for your soldier and your soldiers' vehicles. While bracing the harshness of few players as with any Source™ mod, this is a gem of its genre that is really one of a kind. AND FREE!I totally recommend!!!			",202,12,4,8,14,0,8

												Great mod for Half-Life 2.One player is the builder inside of the commander vehicle to manage research, drop buildings and eventually defend his position. Some people like Mr. Hobbes enjoy invading enemy territory and wreaking havoc behind enemy lines all by themselves. This sometimes ends up with the game being lost due to a rambo commander.The others fight to get the refinery spots and hold them until they have the technology and resources to build tanks with better armor and weapons, with the objective of destroying the enemy commander vehicle or all of the enemy spawn points. Some maps have limited lives(tickets) and when they reach 0 no one on the team can spawn. They can be revived by engineers though...			",190,16,3,22,16,0,24

												This game is honestly awesome, it is a breed of rts and fps, I always whished there was a game like that and I found it.pros: since it is an old game, even though it has large maps, it runs smoothly on this any computer, even the one that I use to play games while travling.This game has a decent firing recoil and such so new players will hit something (cough cough sc:go)This game is FREEcons:This game is not the type of game you pick up and play, I spent at most 30 min looking at hel forms and the controls.The commander(the rts guy) has the most confiesing job and the new players think it is a good thing and they will vote them selfs to be a commander.Some griefers/new players will take the commander's vec(destroy the others' Commander then you win the game) and ride it to the enemy to harm you/they think it is a tank.all and all it is a prety fun game, the grapichs are acceptble at worst, athor wise I would suggest getting this game and spending at least 4 hours(one match) on the game and then decied.here is a list that I did not know wether to put into pros' or cons':At the end it will be a gaint tank sludge festThe default charchter you start with is scout/sniperThe communication menu is confiesing (new players can't spam)			",37,0,0,2,0,0,5

												The tactics involved in playing this game are layered endlessly. If NF has reason to believe you might be heading for straight for railgun heavies, you should respond with a light tank or APC rush early game (unless they are expecting you to, of course). Commanding actual players is extremely challenging but endlessly rewarding. Much like Age of Empires II, the gameplay does not reach any sort of nash-equilibria because the real bottleneck is your own ability to keep track of everything at once.For the soldiers on the ground, the game is totally different. The tactical challenge lies is choosing your class, or the loadout of your tank, and in making sure that the decisions of the team as a whole make sense, and that nobody is missing some sneaky enemy tactic. The constant challenge otherwise is of course, to aim and respond, using cover to keep yourself alive while gaining ground on the enemy. All of the guns respond decently, but you'll find your preferences - I love the sniper and pistol, but many prefer the shotguns. Fortunately none of them are so overpowered that they become the only choice.Unfortunately, although there are many players, most of the time none of them are playing at all. That's why you will see many people arguing over whether the game is ""dead"" or not. See for yourself with the steam charts tracker[steamcharts.com], which tells you not only if people are playing right now, but also all the trends (saturday and sunday mostly, with a smaller peak on wednesday).http://steamcharts.com/app/17740 ",16,1,0,0,0,0,2

												It is actually not dead, some russian even picked me up and thought me, what a proper tutorial would have done.There is a server that still plays often, gameplay wise its a combination of an rts commander (role can be swapped easily with a vehicle) and soldiers on the ground that may use vehicles. Kind of like the old battlefield games.Really recommended with a large group of friends since its a free mod for a game most people have.PS; the achievements are totally broken and can't be obtained anymore.

												Pretty fun, all things considered. Some basic Pros are:-Teamwork- It's needed, a lot, so it's encouraging people to co-ordinate to complete objectives. Squads are also available.-Progress in-game- Research trees, vehicle upgrades, and ranking make the game fairly entertaining, and a bit immersive too. -Fun- We all love it.One general con, and that's a lack of an active playerbase these days. When it was highly populated, the game was very fun. Overall, 9/10, reccomended to everyone.			",88,9,0,14,11,0,26

I suggest it because it blends RTS with FPS, which makes it way more interesting, mainly because the players are humans and not some drone who will blindly follow orders at the click of a mouse.

												Best FPS game I have played. Dynamic gameplay, huge player limit and skilled community make up for a constant hail of bullets and neverending fun as a simple soldier, who needs to teamwork if he wants to live another minute. The strategic aspect is not my favourite (I'm really bad at strategy games) but gives you a lot of fun too when your forces listen to you and you guide them to victory.Devs are close to the people, the community is loving albeit harsh at times, the more professional part of the community is like a big family (there is hate but they still love each other).Charging in front of/along a 10+ heavy tank charge right into the enemies? One of the best feelings I have ever experienced in--game.11/10			",129,19,6,16,22,1,30

												Absolutely awesome game and my new favourite since I discovered the GNU/Linux version of it a few days ago!The best FPS+RTS mix so far imho, when you take a (little) bit of time to get really into it, it's just sooo much fun. :)It's free, so give it a try!(And don't let yourself be put off the first minutes by the complex gameplay or the graphics which are of course not 2017 big budget AAA comparable, 'Empires' is something very unique, special and simply a hidden gem for serious FPS gamers! ;-) )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good game overall, but it has two SEVERE balance issues:-Explosives are incredibly underpowered, and tanks are incredibly resistant to them, which makes combat against tanks extremely slow, especially since their armor regenerates on its own.-Turrets are completely immune to bullets. This makes absolutely no sense, and can quickly lead to extremely one-sided battles, especially when someone places turrets near their enemy's base. ",43,0,0,8,1,0,2

												This game. Oh, this game! tl;dr: It's very good and relatively bug-free game/mod on the Source engine. Definitely recommended, especially since it's free. Also a good community if a bit small.Gameplay: 8/10Positives--Cohesive combat system-Immersive/Extensive modifications for vehicles-Multiple weapons to choose from with four different classes-Each class is pretty self explanatory and easy to recognize, yet has uniqueness-Each weapon is fairly well balancedNegatives--Combat can feel somewhat clunky at times-Melee rarely is useful-Buildable MG turrets next to useless at longer ranges and in small spaces equally (Probably balanced still, just throwing it out there)Graphics: 6/10Positives--Often things are easy to identify from the natural landscape-Visuals don't ususally detract from actual gameplayNegatives--Graphics are basic/low quality(It's Source Engine, what do you expect, Triple A graphics?)Content Overview:The description is truthful, it combines strategy with FPS. If you don't mind a few players in the commander and in general who tend to treat the game a bit too much like ARMA, this game is right for you.The commander vehicle is the key to every game. You lose it, game over, other team wins. End of your sad, sad story of hardship. It lets you build things like refineries and barracks. It has some armour, so don't worry about it spontaneously combusting. As long as you don't go into the water like a dumbass, you should be fine.Which brings us to the next sub-topic: Buildings.A variety of buildings exist, including...Refinery: Produces resources for your team to use. Your entire infrastructure depends on at least one of these existing. Don't lose it. Can only be build on corresponding resource nodes.Barracks: Lets your team spawn and change class there. Very important.Armoury: Lets your team regain health, ammo, and allows them to change class.Vehicle Factory: Self explanatory. Allows your team to construct vehicles. More on that later. If you don't have one of these soon, you're probably gonna lose.Repair Station: Repairs and resupplies friendly vehicles.Radar: Allows your team's commander to research new technologies that advance your team's vehicles, or some other things. Also reveals enemies within its range. If you lose this, it either means:A: Your comm is♥♥♥♥♥♥and doesn't know where to place buildingsB: An enemy managed to slip past your defenses and destroyed itC: You're losing. Welcome to life, folks.ML Turret: Stands for Missile Launcher. Can also be built by the engineer class. Only attacks vehicles and buildings.MG Turret: Stands for Machine Gun. Can also be built by the engineer class. Only attacks infantry.Walls: Self explanatory. Can also be built by the engineer class.Engineer exclusive buildings:Camera: Reveals enemies in its line of sightRadar: Reveals enemy vehicles in a certain rangeWith all that, onto the next can of worms, vehicles. I'm not going to go into detail with these. If you want detail, there are plenty of guides on the community page.Light Tank: Also known as the AFV in the Brenodi Empire.Medium Tank: Also known as the Tank in the Brenodi Empire. A (debatedly) more powerful version of the light tank.Heavy Tank: Most powerful (debatedly) tank in either team's arsenal. Can equip (yes) nuclear rockets.Artillery Tank: Fires extremely powerful artillery shells over long distances. If you're not careful, a few of these can completely anihillate a base.APC: Equips machine guns and grenade launchers. Can also act as a spawn point.Jeep: An unarmoured, but fast vehicle with no weapons.I'm not going to go into any more detail then that, but I'd definitely recommend this expansive and unique mod on the Source engine. Development is slow due to lack of funds, but if you like it enough, I'm sure you can help remedy that.With that said, good day.			",18,3,1,4,4,0,4

												Empires is a mod that combines FPS and RTS. There are 4 classes: engineer, rifleman, grenadier and scout. You can play as any of them or also as a commander. The commander is playing his own RTS game where his soldiers are real people. The soldiers fight on the battlefield in FPS game style. Each of the classes requires some practice to master.The mod is not very good looking, but is fun to play if there are enough players on a server.If you like cooperative teamplay you can give a try to Empires.Sounds 6/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

												Empires is a extrodianary game with two groups competing for control over the entire map. I sadly have to admit it is difficult and the player base is low. But this game is a high developed in my opinion and requires massive amount of teamwork. This cohessive unit destroyes enemies outposts, bases, and strongholds with heavily armed defenses as well as tank brigades. The ability of victory only comes to those who desire to obey there commander and his level of desire to lead. With every nuke flying through the air across your eyes and artiliary supressing the entire area, there is only you and your team. Good luck and you are welcome to join us. + it's free.

												This game is exceptionally good, especially in the complex and rewarding tactics possible. It's not some shoot-em-up where everyone only works for kills, early in the game most of the team is doing support roles. An engineer can bring a skill to bring allies back from the dead, but still has his submachine gun, seismic grenades to destroy buildings, can construct buildings placed by the commander, placing his own turret, and a radar or camera, and dropping an ammo box. All of these can be done by a single player. Meanwhile, a grenadier carries a mortar against buildings, a rocket launcher against vehicles, landmines, a handgun, the ability to detect mines, and can choose skills such as detecting the armor of enemy tanks, defusing mines, extra armor while driving, and many more.

												Very fun game, has a short, but fairly hard learning curve, and then almost infinite potential for improvement.In this game it's fairly easy to get good, i.e. be better than 70%, but to be in top 5% you need to really grind certain skillsets, whether it be being a good squad leader, or learn how to land your mortars inch-perfect. On the surface, fairly simplistic.Here's a basic run down (and a rating out of 5) for classes:Engineer - revives fallen teammates, heals injured teammates, builds and repairs structures (commander dropped) as well as his own (walls/turrets/cameras/radars). Has seismic grenades which are excellent at taking down enemy structures.Ease of learning (highest is easiest) - 5/5Ease of reaching potential (highest is easiest to get really good at) - 4/5Anti-infantry - 2/5Anti-tank - 2/5Anti-structure - 5/5Solo potential (how useful the class is when played alone) - 3/5Group potential (how useful the class is when played in a squad/with teammates) - 5/5HIGHLY RECOMMEND ENGINEER TO NEW PLAYERS!Rifleman - mows down enemy infantry with ease, provides surpressing fire and long distance fire as well. Important in close combat, but requires engineer support to be fully functional. Has regular and sticky grenades, which can stick onto enemy vehicles and explode causing high damage.Ease of learning - 4/5Ease of reaching potential  - 3/5Anti-infantry - 5/5Anti-tank - 1/5 (3/5 with stickies)Anti-structure - 1/5Solo potential - 1/5Group potential  - 4/5Scout - infilitrator/spy/assassin/James Bond. This is an almost purely support class which is highly useless but  cause can cause a lot of hassle when paired up with another class. Besides regular SMGs available, this class has a scout rifle, a ""sniper"" rifle as referred by some. Has a hide ability, as well as radar stealth and enemy detection. Has smoke/concussion/stun grenades Generally avoid this class unless you know what you're doing.Ease of learning - 3/5Ease of reaching potential - 2/5Anti-infantry - 3/5Anti-tank - 1/5 (2/5 with stun)Anti-structure - 3/5Solo potential - 2/5Group potential - 4/5Grenadier - it's in the name. Has a pistol, a dumbfire (or guided) RPG, a mortar, and mines. Has good vehicle related skillsets.Ease of learning - 2/5Ease of reaching potential - 1/5Anti-infantry - 4/5Anti-tank - 5/5Anti-structure - 4/5Solo potential - 3/5 (add +1 if you've mastered this class)Group potential - 4/5 (add +1 if you've mastered this class)Onto vehicles:Jeep - basic transportation vehicle carries from 2-4 people (including the driver), has no mountable weaponsAPC - spawnable-in transportation vehicle carries 8 (including the driver), carries an MG and Grenade LauncherLight Tank/AFV - available by default first tank in the game. Carries standard cannon, a dumbfire missile, and a standard machine gunMedium Tank - carries advanced weaponry, has increased armor, but reduced speed and manouverabilityHeavy Tank - carries even more advanced weaponry, even more increased armor, but further reduced speed and manouverabilityArtillery Tank - fires up in the air in an arc. Has no short distance capabilites, is usually useful and weeding out the enemy out of a specific area.The game has a lot of depth to it which is not obvious on the first play through.Myself had to reinstall the game 5 times, before I finally ended up liking it.Would gladly do it again. :)			",163,21,6,11,15,1,27

												This game is a masterpiece and is extremely addictive. Considering this is only a mod it really could be considered a game of its own. The game itself doesnt run to bad at all and the gameplay is really solid for a game of this age and it really keeps you hooked in with the commanders on each side shouting out orders to their men. Now heres the cons: the tutorial at the begining is kind of sparce on details and on what to do. i spent about 10 minutes running around the armoury only to find i had to put the repair tool on it to build it. Another turn off is the fact that most of the vets to the game are pretty die hard and usually hate trying to show the new guys the ropes. This hate is not always avoidable but most of the time it just takes practice and a little skill. All you have to do is follow your commander's order and you 'll usually be fine. However, don't just waltz in and think you know everything in this game,cause you don't. The only way you will grow in this game is if you practice,listen and take LOTS of advice. All in all, this game is solid,well made and just all around good fun. I would suggest this to people who love strategy games, are up for a good challenge and have a good amount of patience, cause boy are you going to need it. Happy Gaming -HALT			",66,2,0,11,2,0,3

												Great game. If I were to grade the game strictly on its own merits it would easily be the greatest source mod. However, alot of the ""veterans"" of the game create an atmosphere which quickly turns away potentially new players. This game has a ""commander"" who essentially places structures and issues strategy for a team to follow. If you're a new player, never ever even try to command. You will be criticized harshly if you make even one mistake. Essentially this leaves players in a catch 22. You can't gain experience as commander unless you are allowed to command in atleast a 5v5, but if you play a 5v5 you  can't command and get better due to veterans criticizing you to the extent that you just leave. Alot of veterans believe the game is dead/dying due to new players performance as commanders (noted on multiple occasions that vets would blame bad comms for the reason why people would turn away from this game.) This is simply not the case. The game is dying for two reasons. One, source engine is getting old, and two, the majority of the veteran community is extremely unforgiving towards new players. Overall the game itself 10/10, but combined with the  community its probaly closer to 7/10.			",65,2,1,7,5,1,12

												The game looks rough around the edges, but it is a free to play game. But where aesthetics are not to par with other first person shooters, it makes up in playability and quality of game play. Everyone starts off equal in ability and rank, but the game rewards your performance. The more you play, the better you become, and thus you will be a better mmber of your team. Play the tutorial and do not be afraid to ask for help. Veteran players will go out of their way to help you maximize your experience in this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												tl:dr -> Excellent game for FPS and RTS fans; huge amounts of teamwork and customisation; playing with friends makes it even better. And it's free, so what have you got to lose? Give it a try!Personally, i love this game. The gameplay is unique amongst the FPS and RTS genres; nothing quite like it... And nothing has surpassed it in all these years... Yes it's old, yes the community is small... But the game has something about it... Something that makes people keep coming back to it over all these years. That's why i'm nominating it for the Test of Time award.The teamplay element is amazing, it's great to play alone (so much to explore), but even better with friends. Up to 5 of you can form a squad, and earn bonus points for working together...The game has a lot of depth, huge amounts of customisation available; it's not cosmetics though, but real meaningful options that improve and change how your character plays and the vehicles you can build over the course of a game...And it has Vehicles too... and now the RTS elements come into play here... you can research new technologies that allow for new weapons, armours, engines and entirely new vehicle chassis that you can get as the game progresses. And you can mix and match these to customise your vehicles to suit whatever tactical situation you need. The progression isn't like more modern games with item unlocks and new skin rewards; but you can feel that sense of skill progression as you get better with time. It's easy to learn, but incredibly hard to master.Oh yeah, and its asymmetric, not just red vs blue... Both teams play differently...Also, its got 64 player servers... so massive 32v32 matches can happen... That's almost unheard of in modern games.I unreservedly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of FPS or RTS games. It deserves more players.It's Absolutely Awesome. 10/10.			",33,0,0,3,9,0,10

												Empires is a FPS/RTS hybrid where one player in each time takes the role of the commander who can conduct research, place buildings, give orders and construct tank (layouts). The goal is to destroy the vehicle of the enemy commander which seems easy enough, but the game provides many ways to achieve your goal: tank rush the commander, have a small squad sneak up on him and destroy him,  or eventually humilate the enemy commander by pushing him into a nearby lake or a river where he takes damage until he dies.Though, that's not the only thing that you need to take care of... there are buildings to be build, resource points to be captured (by destroying enemy refinaries and building your own on them), critical positions to be secured by foritifying them with walls, turrets and mines, offensives to be launched with your squad or tanks....The game offers a good diversity and can be very entertaining for a while. It is definetly worth trying out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, this game is absolutely FREE so you lose nothing from trying it. Probably one of my favourite Source mods in existence and still has a very active playerbase and forum community. Before the game was placed on Steam, I'd play this religiously so my hours would probably be closer to the 200-300hr range. Anyhow, the thing that sets this game apart from others is that in certain gamemodes, it actually has two styles of gaming...Infantry (FPS):The standard mode with classes that have upgrade paths that you customize as you earn experience for contributing to your team. The team can be broken down further into squads that have a squad leader that earns and selects power-ups for well-performing squads. Powers like squad revive can turn the tide of a final ticket push. Under vehicle maps, once a vehicle factory has been built by the commander, all infantry units are capable of building AND CUSTOMIZING the tanks they take into battle, from the weapons that are mounted onto it to the type of amount of armor on the vehicle. The tank battles are the bread and butter of this game as each weapon you're capable of mounting has armors it's good against and ones that it's not. Weight, slots, and cooldown put realistic restrictions on the tanks so you don't have a tank with 5 nukes strapped to it and make the tank battles all the more engaging. Additionally, each class has different upgrades for different vehicles (such as additional cooldown, artillery feedback, etc) that could really give you the advantage in battle.Commander Gameplay (RTS):Theres a steep learning curve, especially against people who have been playing this game for over 5 years. However, once you've got everything else down -- like what weapons are good to research and best way to play each map for each faction -- the commander is the single most powerful player in the game. Each team starts the game voting for a commander. From a top-down view, the commander guides units, places buildings and defensive structures, and determines what technology to research -- much like a typical RTS. However, unlike a standard RTS, your infantry units are actual players who chose how they contribute to the team and provide feedback to the commander on what's working or not.Tl;dr: Awesome game with massive tank and infantry battles and RTS gameplay for advanced players. Also the game is free.			",155,32,4,9,8,0,25

												I wrote a review back in 2011, but I am here to reivew it once more. FANTASTIC game. Unique gameplay along with a unique style of game in general. The research tree adds varying gameplay to the late game creating a game that never becomes stale as each commander has their own play style. While the community may be toxic, it is toxicly funny as us vets turn and ♥♥♥♥♥ at each other, after ♥♥♥♥♥ing at new people, and create spectacles as 2 vets argue continuously about whos fault it was (Hint: It was the new persons). Not for the light hearted, it is a great game if you can get past the learning curve. If you listen to a vet or a com when they give you advice, you will go far and won't get ♥♥♥♥♥ed at because at least you tried. However, if you go Scout (Assault) then you are useless and should uninstall.Again, Great Game, Give it a try!			",129,7,1,15,21,1,15

												Been playing afew days now, And ive come to one concolusion. this game is good when its stacked, but its okay again but i would not recromend playing if you are not a fan of constant failure, and very little reward, Either factions has their benefits.But The Beni Empire Is way to OP in my opinion The failure rate compared to the NF = North faction is laughable, 8/10 games you will loose or looose all 10 as the North faction, alot of the problems i have come across are mostly team stacking problems and pros against Rookies, if you aren't one for stressful situations and really angry players i wouldn'r recormend itBut if you feel like trying at least bring 2-3 freinds with you , or expect alot of failures, also Beni empire Weapons can kill you so damn easily but yet using the North Faction weapons are like pea shooters compared to their weapons and ive seen 1 Beni Empire gunner, Mow down at least 6-8 people if there lucky with one mag, not to mention the normal riflemen who can gunn down at least 3-2 people at once, while our pea shooters barely hurt him.Well the finaly choice is yours of what you think of the game good luck Have fun			",121,9,0,13,9,1,22

												Well, Empires is a REALLY old hl2 mod (it has like 10 years). The Game is a hybrid between FPS and RTS, it's like battlefield but with a commander(who gives the orders and build the things like Age Of empires or any other RTS).+ Has various gamemodes.+ Dedicated Playerbase+ Helpful Community-the Game requied A LOT of player responsability and teamwork (mostly the command)-Learning Curve is elevated, expect to be smashed-The player base is really small(expect play this game on weekends)-This game has Frustrating and Annoying game mechanics. You can't sprint so much and the maps are REALLY big, you have to walk A LOT, Reviving and healing allies is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Driving vehicles it's just terrible.I don't recommend this game because, I just feel that the game, even if with their 10 years it feels incomplete and Empty.

												Empires a Mod for the Source Engine, a First Person Shooter, Real Time Strategy.Pros:+Both factions have there own unique weaponry+I like the mix between the two genres, FPS and RTS.Cons:-Close to the end of the round it becomes more vehicle based, which can get a little boring at times.-There is only one server with people on it, has♥♥♥♥♥♥admins especially [VIPER]_Vicki-Most players are not friendly towards new players, especially when trying to be comm, literally got screamed at because the other team managed to take over all the refinerys and prevent us from pushing up even though I had no way of getting them backSo its a fun game, when you can actually play the game without dealing with nine year old girls that don't know how to administrate properly and ban you for stupid reasons.

												What can I say aboot Empires.... It has eaten hours of my life with great team based fps/rts hybrid amazeballs action and me likes! When commanding the game takes on a rts style gameplay where you manage resources, research tech for vehicles, and place buildings, but instead of npc's doing to fighting and building you have ACTUAL players who you can issue commands to(most of the time they wont follow them lol) and will fight for you. The core game community is a hard nut to crack though, the vet players have little patience for new guys and will make their frustration with your refusal to go engineer the 1st 10mins of match very apparent lol THERES NO PAY TO WIN HERE like alotta free games, its just a great game thats sorta like a sleeper hit, its amazing but not alotta people know about it. Servers have about 12-25 people on weekdays and when friday comes it goes to 30-48, the community is growing and each time I take a break from playing and come back its more people playing. I LOVE YOU EMPIRES! SHOUT OUT TO THE CREEPER AND JUSTGOFLY! GO♥♥♥♥♥URSELF MR.X LOL			",58,3,0,11,1,0,7

												This game, as a concept, is great. The shooting is decent enough by modern standards, the vehicle gameplay is pretty solid, the base construction isn't too bad, but the one thing that lets this game down more than anything else is the player base. Back when I started playing 6 years ago in version 2.24d, the player base was much larger, and much more active. Slowly, over time, it has shrunk to probably about 60 active players. Everytime I try to come back, it is very difficult to find a server, and even when you do, there is no point in playing on it. The community in this game is by far the most toxic and unforgiving playerbase on the internet, worse than any other game I have ever played. If you make a mistake, they will flame you, if you disagree with how to play, they will flame you. It is impossible to actually enjoy this game, because it is so full of trolls, jerks, and just generally toxic players. The game never really changes, there are probably still bugs in it which have been around for years. I love this game, I really do, I miss being able to play it, but the community is so vile, it is not worth the time or effort.			",107,8,3,21,15,3,47

												Don't let this mod fool you. It may look like a Command & Conquer look alike, but there's more to it though.At the beginning of the match, your goal is to either reduce the tickets of the opposing team or destroy their command vehicle.There's 4 classes to choose and each have their own ways of doing things. Not only that, but they also have the ability to learn new skills and perks in combat. There's skills that go with classes and skills that are class specific. Oh and the Engineer counts as a medic too.But that's enough about the soldiers. You must be wondering what makes this an RTS mod because, I'm making it sound like a first person shooter. Well, that's because it's both an FPS and an RTS mod.The RTS part is that whoever gets in the command vehicle, is. . .you guessed it. The commander.The commander is in charge of managing your team's base. You have to upgrade, research and build to help your team. But in order to build something though, a soldier has to be near the position you want to build on. So send in an engineer and tell him what you need building. If your engineer will listen that is.Yes this mod is team work heavy. It's vital if you want to win. Otherwise I can't guarrantee you'll win even a single match if you can't cooperate with your other team mates.So if you want to play a mod that's both an FPS and an RTS, give Empires a try. But I'm sad to say that this mod is almost completely dead. You'll be lucky to find a server with players in it.Also, I recommend getting some training before you try out being a commander. Commander is hard figuring out once you try being one, so get some commander training or else you'll never know what you're doing. As well as get bashed by your team mates for being the worst commander ever.			",179,9,0,28,10,1,17

												For a free game, this game was not bad. Putting time into it is  a waste though.There are certain maps that are pretty crappy. Not going to lie, the maps are one-sided most of the timeUpon that, there is only one server. seriously, it could have a total of 2 but thats it, 8v8, not at all close to the max, and when I say there is only one server, I mean there is only one server where you can play. the other servers are very inactive, no one plays them. And sure I got a few hours. Problem is, its not being worked on anymore.So after a few hours, I officially see just how over powered the game's units are compared to the others.			",36,8,0,3,15,0,17

												wow. First of all, I didnt know how to play. I played a server and these scottish people where raging. Or at least they were scottish... Anyway, I had no clue what was what, and those scots where getting on my nerves cause they wouldn't stop swearing. So I said, and I quote ""♥♥♥♥♥♥yar bloody traps ya stupid lil buggers"" And I got banned from that server for ""Abusiveness"". You need to have single player with bots to level up to. You also need to make F11 not to close the game. Game cycles are VERY LONG, and there are not a lot of people who play the game. Sadly this game is a NONO! Great idea, dumb gameplay and mechanics.GO PLAY BATTLEFIELD 1942 Instead. Looks better, runs better, and is better.			",68,6,1,6,9,0,5

												Please note that this mod is completely dead, check the Steam server browser if you don't believe me.I wouldn't recommend this just because the community (or at least whats left of it) has degraded to the point that it consists solely of autistic fartlords like PatPeter ruining the fun for everyone and driving any remaining veteran (pre-2.12) players away. If you're new expect to get banned for absolutely nothing or at least screamed at until you leave.Great concept, but it attracted the worst people after 2.12. People like the administrators of VIPER that thought it was a good idea to ban 9mining (a crucial game mechanic that has traditionally been used as a last ditch effort to kill the enemy's command vehicle)-some dude that started playing empires back in 1.08 and watched in disbelief as the entire community fell apart after 2.24			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I downloaded the game fresh off of steam and got this error: couldn't load file empire/console/background01.vtf I think thats what it said. And I tried to fix it but nothing is working, I think I'm just going to get the Moddb version just because the game wont load the background file even though its there... wait, it worked, i got into the game without it crashing but it was just a black screen... aand now another error. I guess i some how tried to start a match but the game couldnt load some models in the map. Great! IF THIS GAME WORKS AFTER AWHILE, THIS WILL BE RECOMENDED, IF NOT, THEN NOT RECOMENDED..

												I highly recommend this game.  If you are a fan of Unreal Tournament, you will enjoy watching your base conquering various ""node"" locations as you decide where you will go and how you will strategize.  If you enjoy team-based play, this game is for you.  Has an incredible command voting system at start of game and the commander helps direct players, performs research, constructs buildings, etcetera.  Like Counter Strike Source?  Then you'll love the weapons and gameplay aspects of this as well.  Commander directs the players, and hopefully...the players obey.  Who will win?  It all comes down to whose commander is better...and which commander has the most capable and most obedient units.			",67,0,0,8,35,0,9

												The blend of the RTS and FPS gamepplay in Empires makes for an amazingly fun and unique experience. Seeing as this mod just recently came back in terms of developer support, I really hope to see it make a comeback in the community as well. Give this game a try, it's certainly worth at least that.

												An excellent squad based shooter mixed with RTS elements. One player becomes the commander, researching techs for better equipment and vehicles, managing resouces, building pre-set vehicles for faster construction, setting waypoints for ground units and helping to protect the main base. Meanwhile, players on the ground build the projects set by the commander and defend valuable buildings such as barracks and vehicle depots. Combat, for the most part, if fun and challenging with multiple classes and multiple guns for each class. Anti-Armor classes, Base Infantry, and Medics keep pressure on the front line while Engineers contruct turrets and keep bases and resource collectors safe. Sniping is perhaps the most difficult, and yet the most rewarding, since the maps are so large, sniping is a real challenge, but can turn the tide of battles.  As for faults, graphical fidelity is rather low with any given map's group texture being the same texture streched across miles, finally, many maps feature long and dull tracts of land that brings about boring combat. However, despite these few gripes, Empires is an excellent game with many facets that has kept me playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down best concept! The equation we're talking about here is equivalent to Red Alert x Battlefield x Half Life 2, which theoretically should = quite a fantastic gaming experience! The commander's options take time to learn to get used to. As reacting quickly and getting together all of the right research upgrades to meet the preference of your men is deemed 'taskworthy'. I wouldn't say the multi-tasking is comparable to the difficulty of a well-known strategy game such as StarCraft 2, unless you can consider particular FPS gameplay types as 'strategic'. This mod is a game which holds a completely magnificent and unique genre all to its own. Recommend this to all your friends and get a team together! See you on the battlefield!			",37,3,0,4,3,0,0

												I highly recommend this game.  If you are a fan of Unreal Tournament, you will enjoy watching your base conquering various ""node"" locations as you decide where you will go and how you will strategize.  If you enjoy team-based play, this game is for you.  Has an incredible command voting system at start of game and the commander helps direct players, performs research, constructs buildings, etcetera.  Like Counter Strike Source?

Empires is alot of fun to play and a nice change in pace, the blend of RTS and FPS mixes perfectly. Theres still a small active community today. I've played it and had alot of fun, if you like Natural Selection or Nuclear Dawn you might want to try it. Its free and only 2 gigs so why not right? Its got vehicles, forts , sentry guns, its all good.10/10 A very fun free mod if you dont mind its age.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably the most epic game i've ever played. It might not always work in just the right way, but when it does - when you get just the right combination of teamwork and direction, you get to have one of the most awesome game experiences that i've ever encountered.Empires is truly a good game, but it's unrealised potential is still incredibly vast. The mod still needs a push to get rolling down the hill, but if it does, it could possibly become something previously unseen, something groundbreaking.I spent a few years of my life believing in this game. Now it's gotten to this point, I can only believe it will finally get the attention and help it deserves.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Empires is one of the best hl2 mods I've ever seen. It is definetly in the same legue as Garry's mod is!Empires is a strategic game where two teams compete for domination on the map. On every team there is one player that has been voted commander by the others. He place buildings, research new technologies and help his team as much as he can.The infantry consists of four classes with different specialities: planting mines, building turrets etc. These classes need to co-operate togheter and with their commander to achive their goal. However, the other team does the same.Generally this is a VERY well-made mod and it is constantly improving and I believe it would soon be in state to become it's own game, just as Gary's mod has already done. So if you're not already in the battle, well, then you better join!			",187,19,1,19,23,3,28

												If you are a fan of RTS- and FPS-Games then be certain that you will like this good piece of digital art. It mixes essential elements of both genres together by having an all knowing commander who is able to build and research at the same time (like in a real RTS), while the rest of the team plays the role of his soldiers, who are supposed to follow the orders they have been given to (in a FPS manner).The game is free, so it is definitely worth to take at least a look. But be sure to check out the controlls first, before starting to ask your teammates questions like: ""How to spawn?""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
