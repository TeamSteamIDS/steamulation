												One of the best strategy games of all times if not the best. A turn based game that is nearly perfect at all levels. The game conquered my heart with its great ambiances and environments, magical songs, beautifully animated 2D units, great scenario, original playable races, badass characters, well-made dialogs and difficulty level. I consider this as the hardest strategy game that I have played. Custom scenarios were amazing and the editor tool was so easy to use. I ended up crating new maps although there were no one to play with. Imagine Warcraft III and Civilization IV combined.. No you don't need to imagine, because this game exists!Cat humanoids called Tigrans, out of this world creatures Syrons, Dragonians, Arabian and Turkish inspired people Nomads, arctic hobbits, evil bug like creations Shadow Demons... Even goblins had their own race... All these original races are so remarkable and unforgottable and playing with them is still fun and intense even after a total of ten years. Be whoever you want to be, add a character bio, put your photoshopped picture on it, create new heroes and lead them to fight... Fight aganst good or evil, it does not matter, because you don't always get to play with good leaders. Be an evil Elven wizard or be a heavenly good Orcish shaman. Summon beholders, elementals, dragons and crack the earth under their feet while you separate their army with your tornados.Go deep in the woods, find camps and ask them if they want to join you. If they answer ""No"" then kill all of them and take their money. Get ready for more adventure, visit old ruins that are full of zombies and skeletons, steal baby dragons from their mothers, hire a drunk Dwarven engineer from tavern to protect you and improve their fighting skills in arena. Explore sunken shipwrecks and kill pirates, or just simply be a pirate! Visit beautifully made underworld to catch some outlaws and find new allies, like Goblins, Tigrans and Dwarves. Trade spells with their leaders and expand your empire. Banish terrestrial beings from their homes and get extra money from it. Be a bad person for once in your life! They'll hate you, they'll talk about you and they'll fear you and your undead champions! Raze cities and loot them! Destroy empires and rise yours! Open the doors of engineering schools and buy some flame throwers and baloons to fly over the mountain. Order them to build up a tank for you! Move your army into the tank and raze enemy's wall and ruin their buildings over their head, because you know that they deserve it! Teleport to the Shadow world, exterminate all evil and good spirits! Stamp big insects, larvas and feel the beauty of this place. Help Syron giants and occupy demonic cities with their power. Enjoy the game, enjoy the gameplay, enoy the song, enjoy every step you make, every unit you kill and every hero you hire, every city you conquer, every mountain you climb, every cave you explore, every turn you make... Enjoy it!			",120,20,3,13,8,0,20

												I have to say, this game is the end all, be all for turn based strategy games for me. As a long time fan of Heroes of Might and Magic 3, as well as other less well received TBS games, this one continues to shine and take up space on my hard drive. This purchase marks the 3rd time that I've bought the game. One hard copy, once on GOG, and now the steam version, almost soley so that I can review this bad boy. First of all, forget the campaigns. Games like these were MADE for the random maps. The campaigns, while entertaining, are really just long tutorials to ready you for the random map generator, which is where this game shines. 12 races, multiple combinations of magi, and a multitude of play styles lay before you. That enemy city before you just a little too tough to take? Scorch their lands and transform them to deserts and watch their populace riot from their discontent at their new, inhospitable world. A mountainrange in your way? Level the terrain and march your troops across it, backdooring your opponent into new depths of discontent.  That being said, play it with your friends to elevate this game to the height that it deserves. This is the ultimate multiplayer strategy game. Get your friends together and LAN this game. You won't regret it.After purchasing AOW III, I have to admit, while that game IS awesome, I still make time in my day to go back to Shadow Magic. It's well worth the time. Every ♥♥♥♥ing time. Stop reading this now and go buy this game. If you're a turn based strategy person, or just a strategy gamer at all, you owe it to yourself to play this game. Good luck, and may your wizard towers provide you all the spell range you require!Disclaimer: I have literally played hundreds (and I don't mean one or two) of hours of this game and expect to play hundreds more. Buy it. you won't regret it.			",315,105,1,104,42,3,102

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.One Hour Reviews - Game 4Age of Wonders - Shadow MagicPurchase Date: 5/22/2014I got this game, along with the original Age of Wonders in a Humble Bundle.  I didn't warm up very well to the original, so my hopes were not very high for this one.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find that none of the things that annoyed me about the original game are present here.I jumped right into the tutorial.  Compared to the original, the tutorial in this game is vastly improved.  The tutorial, like the original, starts by covering the basics of movement around the map and claiming resources, but then proceeds into a lot more detail.  I felt like I had a much better sense of what my options were and what I needed to be doing.When I played the first Age of Wonders, I actually had to restart the tutorial because I died.  What I appreciated about Shadow Magic is, it gave me a good sense of the difficulty right off the bat, but I didn't have to start the entire tutorial over.  The very first fight I got in, a giant beetle ended up stomping my entire party.  But the tutorial was written to expect this, so rather than having to start over, the tutorial used this experience as a teaching lesson on what to expect.  I really appreicated that.The graphics in Shadow Magic are better, but that is to be expected given the length of time between the games.  I didn't care for the animations in the original, but here the units move more naturally.  Also the game provided all the resolution choices I'd expect to see.  I played at 1920x1080, and didn't have any problems with menus or reading text.The actual gameplay itself seemed much like the same turn-based strategy from the original Age of Wonders, which itself brought back memories from the old Heroes of Might and Magic games.  I have a feeling that I'd probably enjoy the original more now that I've played this tutorial and have a better grasp of the game.The only thing that really annoyed me about Shadow Magic happend when I was trying to back out of a command that I was issuing to my party by hitting the escape key.  This brought me out to the main menu.  I then hit the Continue button, except this command will actually load your last saved game.  I didn't have any save games yet so it ended up not doing anything.  I wanted to resume my game, so I hit escape again thinking it would close the menu and take me back into the game, but instead it dumped me out to the desktop.  And thus, my review ended about 8 minutes early.I really didn't expect to like this game given my impression with the original.  So in this case I am glad to be wrong.  I'm looking forward to coming back and spending more time in the campaign.Overall Recommendation:  Keep			",404,112,21,134,55,3,62

												I would recommend anyone who enjoys turn based games to give Shadow Magic a shot. It is a of game that superficially seems rather simplistic with its movements and hex board, but upon closer inspection a plethora of various elements are revealed. This game can give several tactics, such as creating an amphibious army of dwarves, a flying army of leprechauns, and explosive goblins. The balance between unit production and economic policy focus is just right. The only downside that I could say about this game is the possibility that, due to how attacks and damage rolls are done, luck can ruin your day. That and heroes are arrow and bullet magnets because of how powerful they can be if they aren't restrained. Needless to say, these do not detract from the possibility of fielding an army of flying hobbits that can rain havoc and drop flaming meteors on fiendish skeletons. If that has any sort of appeal to you, pick this game up. And do note that there is a sequel, Age of Wonders 3, in the works.			",71,15,0,21,4,0,16

												Props again to my friend Red for gifting me this game. I'm actually going to make this review for Age of Wonders II, and this game as well...The Age of Wonders series is a classic all-time favorite of mine in the case of the two, a challenging and enchanting strategy 4X game with spells, dragons, warriors, armies, everything. It allows you to personalize what kind of wizard you want to play as, how hard the enemies are, the setting you want to fight in, etc.. Haven't played through the campaigns fully for either, though.  Nontheless, Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne, and it's expansion-turned-sequel, Shadow Magic, are games that Fantasy and Strategy fans alike will be spellbound by. Shadow Magic also definately took what AoWII had, and did some improving touch ups on it but still made sure not to fix what isn't broke. But still tried some different things with new additions for bonuses and tactics. Such as looping the limited production queue if you want to build an army even when it's filled.For both nostalgia and quality related reasons, an impressive 9/10 to both games.			",44,1,0,4,5,0,2

												A Civilization type game with Tolkeinesque races, such as Elves, Dwarves, Undead etc. Despite being ten years old, I still find it to be the best of its type.Very similar to most other turn based strategy games, although the difficulty can be a barrier for new players. You control a race, build\control cities, produce armies and buildings and spend time either allying or destroying other races.You control a Wizard on the map who acts as the races leader. Should the Wizard die without any means to revive, your race is defeated.You can take over mines, mills, farms etc on the world map to give you gold per turn. You can use that gold to build and train units, however you have to be aware of how much your spending. Once you've trained units, you also need to pay them a wage per turn. If you don't have enough gold, they may get disgruntled and leave you - possible joining up with your foes! I like this because, rather than just duking it out on a battlefield, you can work on removing your enemies resources and forcing his army to dwindle without ever facing open war.Bad points: the AI often makes nonsense moves, and the diplomacy towards AI is irrational - often they will offer an alliance, before instantly breaking it and declaring war against you. The Steam edition doesn't come with the MASSIVE manual that came with the CD version, so it's worth flicking through an online wiki to get to grips with the game. A tutorial is there, but it's pretty brief.Best played against humans. There's online options, as well as a play by email function which I prefer and tend to be quite active on. The community is still going strong after so long, and maps can still be downloaded. Age of Wonders III is due in 2014, so if this looks too dated for you, might be worth holding out for that.

												Age of Wonders Shadow Magic is a relatively unknown gem of a game.  The entire game is turn-based, with the action happening at the strategic and tactical levels.  As was normal for games of years past, this is a game where you will spend the vast majority of time poring over the hex-based maps; this holds true at the ""world"" level as well as the ""battle"" level.A few things make it stand out of the pack.  At it's core the Strategic level plays out VERY similar to a ""civilization-lite"" style game; establish cities, build and upgrade various structures, research ""tech"" (in this case various spells), and expand your empire across the map.  On top of that, your faction leader can direclty influence gameplay through the casting of spells; some of these are ""global"", affecting the entirety of the map (or targetable upon an opponent), others are ""permanent"" (enchantments upon units), and yet others are direct-combat use (more on this later).  Adding to this is a (VERY LIGHT) diplomacy and alignment component that can affect your race's interaction with other races; some races will ally with, some will tolerate, and others will outright rebel.  The resoureces are limited to two; gold and mana.  Both are generated through your settlements as well as from capturable nodes.On top of a pretty good strategy-level is the tactical battle level.  Rather than moving a stack of your units into a stack of enemy units and hoping you win (by the way, auto-resolve is available, but NOT recommended), the battles take place on another hex-based map.  The terrain of these battlefields is directly based on the ""world map"" terrain as well; one of the weak points is the limited amount of maps that are available (a city map is the same for each person, with cosmetic changes based on the race of the owning city).  However, environmental factors can impact the battles; for example, fire nodes will inginte all units dealing damage over time.  Army stacks are limited to 8 units (8 individuals) per stack, but with proper placement (FLANKING) you can bring 2-3 stacks to bear at at time.  Once the battles start, they play out very similar to a game of chess (or Final Fantasy Tactics, if you prefer).  Each unit has movement allowances and various actions.  Hero units up the ante on this with additional abilities, and ALL units can advance with experience earned (a couple racial units depend on levelling to ""grow"" into stronger units).  Additionally, once engaged in battle, you can cast spells directly against units (or on your units to heal/buff/etc).  Ultimately rather than relying on abstract stacks of units playing number wars, this game allows for a player with small unit tactical proficiency to shine. The game comes with several campaigns, a couple dozen one-off scenarios, and the gem of it all; a pretty customizable random map generator.  One can make an extremely large map with nothing but deserts and mountains (if so inclined), or a small forest map, or anything in between.  Additionally, the random map allows for additional ""layers"" (underground and shadow realm) that maximize on some of the races' inherent abilites, adding more options and replayability.AOW:SM is an older title, and one that will probably slip into obscurity.  However, if you see it on-sale give it a go; for 5-10 bucks, you could do FAR worse and get MUCH less playability from a title.			",89,3,0,22,8,0,35

												For those of you who enjoy the tickling effervescence of vintage animation with your gaming bouquet, I highly recommend AoW:SW. A much less popular side-shoot of the ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" series, this turn-based strategy game dominates its mainstream counterparts in faction balance and gameplay mechanics like actual tactical battle interfaces and strategic use of the player's actual influence and control on the worldmap itself. Considering its price and the fact I've personally spent over 60 hours on it and intend to spend much more, this is a 5 of 5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ignore the lack of playing time with this review. I bought this game when it first came out and got this copy for free when I pre-ordered Age of Wonders III. Frankly, Age of Wonders is the best fantasy 4X series I've played. Shadow Magic was the best in the franchise, until Age of Wonders three came out. This is one of the best, ""One more turn."" games. The developers even put in a clock in the UI, because so many fans requested after playing for many hours longer than they intended. If you like the genre, then this game is worth the $10. However, I would recommend spending $30 on the latest game.			",122,50,0,26,19,3,20

This game corrupts our youth to burn the flag and give up our guns to make way for ""peace"" and ""commerce"", clearly a product of Al Qaeda and if you even consider yourself a true american, you should burn this game at the stake and demand censorship.Game is also very very fun and I can not stop playing, totally recommend buying it			",114,20,1,18,11,0,28

												This is a great game for strategy game fans. It has all the aspects of a quality strategy game, and I have enjoyed my experience with it thoroughly. Although, I think that those who aren't too big on games like Civ and Age of Empires will find this game boring, and should steer in a different direction. If you plan on buying the previous games in this series, know that this is by far the most polished and enjoyable. If you love strategy games like I do, you will have fun with the whole series. But if you simply like to play an hour or two every few days of strategy-based games I recommend only buying Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic. Overall, this is a great game and those of you who enjoy strategy RPGs will have a blast playing this game.			",55,14,0,20,10,0,10

												'Yes but', 'maybe', these are how I'd recommend this. It was originally an expansion pack to Age of Wonders 2, and the funny thing is that I would only recommend this if you haven't played that.The game is great. The gameplay is great. At the time it looked great and in my opinion it has aged well. However my biggest gripe is that missions can end up long. Very long. That's not so bad except that's mostly due to grind. Defenders advantage is really damn strong so it often feels like trench warfare. You can't attack because you have to build some units, and others have to take 10 turns moving across the map.This is also just more Age of Wonders 2. If you are looking for an improvement or advancement; you won't find it. It's just more of the same.			",53,8,1,9,2,0,6

												With its highly varied gameplay, mesmerizing atmosphere, gorgeous soundtrack and overall polish, Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic is a hypnotizing game so absorbing that it made the world around me dissolve away. The largest maps, which have three different levels of land, can provide dozens of hours of gameplay. The new races added to Age of Wonders already fantastic fantasy world and a host of customizable campaign and level editors means that fans of turn-based strategy will never have to play the same missions twice. A random map generator will give you some decent replay value as it works great. It's almost like acquiring a new expansion pack every time you use it.			",119,51,1,44,29,2,55

I cant get my steam version to work after I tried throwing some of my old favorite mods on it. No matter how many times I reinstall / verify files and try to mend the files myself. I broke it.

												Très digne héritier spirituel de Master of Magic, Shadow Magic fait tout ce que propose son aîné, avec des graphismes plus contemporains, et des possibilités de jeu en multi : internet, LAN et Hot Seat.Très très bien, et à l'instar de son aîné, nanti d'un manuel très consistant avec livre de sorts, compendium des unités, etc. Aussi incontournable que Master of Magic pour qui veut se rêver roi d'une contrée fantastique, invoquer des dragons, bricoler des objets magiques pour sa communauté de héros, etc.Incontournable, vous dis-je !PS: Ne pas se fier au compte horaire Steam. J'ai une bonne centaine d'heure au compteur sur ce jeu.PPS: Vous trouverez ici un descriptif très détaillé du jeu : http://aggelonware.free.fr/aowsm/ ",255,81,7,47,20,0,31

												I remember playing this game almost endlessly in my younger years, after losing my copy of the original Age of Wonders. This game is absolutely fantastic; it incorporates a fascinating and engaging lore and world, combined with two choices for story; follow a preset story, or go on a skirmish and make your own, complete with it's own custom races, lands, landscapes, enemies, heros and choices. Aside from a gorgeous game setting and engaging story, the gameplay is also fantastic. The classic turn-based building and movement scenes are fairly standard, but it's during the turn-based battle that the game really comes to life, incorporating cover-based tactics, a huge range of different npcs and special attacks, not to mention the use of magic during the battles to gain the upper edge.All in all, this is a hugely brilliant and amazingly underated game that deserves far more recognition and praise for what it is; and that goes for all games in the Age of Wonders series.

												I love this series. The graphics are nice, the storyline interesting, allies, neutrals and foes have plenty to say, lots to find on each map, and at times, it can be quite hard. Red Dragons with regeneration and heros wearing custom item forge trinkets are a bit broken, but only becomes an issue about halfway through the second level of each wizards campain. The game shines at the start of each set, when you are out with a squishy wizard, an fragile hero, and a handful of low level units.			",77,34,0,34,19,0,14

												Not as different from other 4X games as the original, this iteration is still as good. Think of it as HoMM IV - it's certainly true to its roots, but it's a leap in another direction.The campaign map features an additional subterranian level and feels bigger, busier and more out of control than that of Age of Wonders, but the battles have been scaled down somewhat and the custom hero feature suffers from a greater focus on the campaign.As a stand alone game, it isn't as inviting as AoW, but after mastering its predecessor, it's an ideal dessert.

												I can tell you why I should hate this game. It's dated, AI can be a right bint, I don't like Fantasy and finally, Fairy's..... The sound they make is unbearable. Always giggling, like their hiding something...But somehow this game is like crack. It aint good, it aint pretty and it's defiantly not going to do you justice in the long run, but its simply amazing.Really subtle and smart game play mechanics, you've got to prioritize early on what you want to do, to get the edge over the AI. Really got to understand what each unit is capable of and what all the different status perks mean (there's one dude who can just phase himself out of the games material plain... makes no sense but meh!). Also the Hero system is done really well. They appear kinda randomly and you can give them war gear to basically help you're armies achieve victories on the battlefield. Some of the hero profiles are very humours as well. We once had a guy called bromon or gromos, dude was death in one ear, ♥♥♥♥ing useless dirty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But after a lot of TLC (Tender Loving Care) he became the stallion of the land and once took on a whole cities defence when his whole platoon died (he was up against 13 units and ♥♥♥♥ me I nearly had a brain aneurism).All in all, this is a really gay/happy fantasy, with an awesome soundtrack and in depth game play mechanics for its time. Also there's a giant bird unit whose special ability is ""Toss"". I'll leave it to your imagination.			",79,23,0,12,11,0,24

												TL:DR;In order to get this to work, set cursor to software and don't use Direct3D. Browse to game exe and set it to XP SP3 compatibility and to run as an administrator. Game from 2003 that aged *very* badly, only recommended for necro-philes and fans of the genre.Summary:Released in 2003, which is years after Warcraft 2, Starcraft, Diablo, Dungeon Keeper, Master of Orion 2, Heroes of Might and magic 2 & 3, Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic has some of the crappiest control system implemented.Counter-intuitive, messed up interface, sub par graphics (game looks like 1996 at best, screens are misleading), very arbitrary game mechanics (all your units are blind as f*** and miss most of the time), the game is fairly simple, turn based strategy. Some people will say that it has hidden complexity or high learning curve, but in truth it simply is poorly designed. Difficulty comes from fighting against game UI and game mechanics, not from there being any actual challenge during a gameplay.Considering its release date, there is no excuse for UI being that bad. Every game mentioned above is still playable decades later, precisely because of the great and intuitive UI design. If you could get DK or HoMM2 to run, you would still enjoy it.This isn't the case here and if you are looking for an elder cousing to Endless Legends, the game will disapoint you greatly.

												Understand, my no vote is largely due to being mislead by Steam on this one.  This game was NOT released in 2010, it is from 2003 (I hate when Steam lies about the release date!).  My bad, I didn't dig deep enough.  What this means is, it's VERY dated at this point, and unfortunately did not hold up well in my opinion.  However, very few games do hold up for me after that long, so if you're a fan of old games, this is absolutely worth a look.  For me, the outdated graphics and gameplay along with it only enlarging not scaling up to fit today's screen, and the audio balance issues (if you can hear voice over sound effects blow out speakers, and if sound is sane you can't hear the talking), just made it a non starter in my book.  I have turn based games from this era that are still great, but this one isn't joining them.  Had I played it a decade ago, I almost certainly would have spent days on it rather than minutes.

												Do not buy this game. The copy protection they included causes the game to be unplayable on modern OS. Spend your money elsewhere unless you want to go digging around for a crack so  you can play a game you legit purchased.			",187,112,0,81,21,2,59

												I can not get it to even work. Tried fiddling with all of the options in the configuration menu and running it with compatibility mode, however each time the game simply loads a black screen. And I have to kill it using the task manager.I'm sure the game is good and it looks like something I would enjoy. However don't buy it on Steam, as you'll likely not even be able to play it.

												Meant to buy the Age of Wonders 2 I think so I purchased wrong one.    I couldn't get into this one i think mainly from the graphics and interface or something about the overall look and feel.   I really wish i would have just bought the right one but oh well Age of Wonders 3 is out now I might get that eventually instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is like playing a really bad version of Heroes of Might and Magic. It looks like it would have been fun back in the day when there were less options but even then there was Heroes. The interface is the worst part. It isn't a super bad game but it is'nt a Heroes replacement or subsitute so I would not suggest this game unless you really enjoy these types of games.

												Great game for all who enjoy games like heroes of might and magic and the original Master of magic game. Will also appeal to people who like civilization games or master of orion.The game itself works pretty much like Heroes of might and magic series but you can build cities and fortifications anywhere in the same style as in civilization games. There is diplomacy for trading alliances, tribute, etc. You can also research spells and other abilities. The combat offers far more strategy as units have many different skills and can even rank up. Your heroes can also have a variety of gear and spells and will also gain levels.There is also many variations for your lord and what race you play. Choose first what magic or magics you want to focus on as well as abilities. Then choose a race from among: goblins, orcs, dark elves, humans, hobits, dwarfs, nomads, draconians and many more. I would say that buy this instead of age of wonders 3, this game offers much more content and strategy then its sequal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An all time classic and still amazingly playable. If you like turn based games like warlords and the older entries into the HOMM series, this game easily bests anything else in the genre. There are also some amazing community patches and people still play this online today. Look for Age Of Wonders III soon, and it too should be an instant classic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is as good as hotseat gaming (multiplayer on one pc) has ever gone.My friends and I have easily spent THOUSANDS of hours playing this game since it was released in 2003, for it is one of the only games I have ever found that if you and your mates are in need of something to do it shall NEVER fail to amuse untill your asking yourselfs 'Where did the sun go, why is it dark also I'm hungry!'. If you want to play this game I recommend you stock up on the pizzas and soda because you aren't going to want to leave this game for a long while!The only thing I would have against the game is a slight glitch with the A.I. . For some reason when we play against the computer to get the AI to function properly on the hardest difficulty 'Emperor' we found that at least one AI's needs to be set to 'King' the second hardest difficulty. Don't ask me why but it seems to make a significant difference to game play.For getting a feel for the story and getting a love for the characters in the game I would also recomend Age of Wonders 2 as well for it's sheer amazing story line.

												Shadow Magic is a stand aolone DLC for AoW 2 . sad part is because its a standalone it eliminates the need for AoW2. Why? because eveyrthing thats in AoW2 is in here and more.Very good game.Not as good as the first (even now i am saying that grfx or not AoW had better mechanics.)AoW 3 is the only game to finally topple AoW1			",382,38,7,91,54,3,117

												The Age of Wonders series is basically a turn based fantasy themed conquer the world type game in the vein of the Civilization series. The new Warlock game stole heavily from this game (and Civ 5) for its content and gameplay style. Graphics are dated but the game is simple to play and fun if you like turn based conquer games. This game runs well on older machines. a No brainer to buy if you can catch it on sale for 5 bucks or less.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are looking for a good old turn based game with magic, I highly recommend this one. It lets you variate how the world is created and then choose what race you are and etc. Its a great turn game and lets you have a lot of fun creating your armies and kingdoms!			",36,2,0,13,3,0,7

												This game was my introduction to the turn-based strategy genre, and I found it fantastic. I love so much about this game. There are some flaws in the game, such as some overpowered units, and simplistic AI, but time and time again I will always come back to this game for the great mechanics and the nostalgia. Besides this game is so cheap now on sale on Steam that it would be a waste not to buy it.			",28,9,0,7,2,0,5
