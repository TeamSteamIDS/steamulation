Sleeping, running around!+ You are an alien ship, kidnapping these animals without disturbing them to point of self-destruction. You gotta be smooth :O+ Graphics are cartoon-like and colorful.+ Sounds are fun and not annoying.+ Lots of levels & multiplayer option.Have fun. ",51,47,0,7,14,2,18

												Flock! Flock! Flock!I bought this Game on a sale for 99 Cents and it makes sooo much fun. Im sitting here, play that game and I´m laughing because its so funny to see the ships, bunnys, bulls and chicken run away. All Levels are different and challanging, its not easy to reach in all levels gold.Game also works very smooth with my XBOX360 Gamepad. You also can create your owen map, I tried it a bit out but a tutorial would be very helpfull for the first time. I didn`t tried the Multiplayer yet and I think now (2014) there is no Multiplayer more because gamespy is dead. I wish they would do this game Steamworks and add Steamworkshop so you can create and share your map and download maps from other player.I realy would give this game 10 points but since it only work 60% I have to give it 7 from 10 points.Single player makes realy fun and 99 Cents (on sale price) its worth to buy.

												Sometimes in life we need to be introspective, and ask ourselves difficult questions...questions which require us to look deep within and examine the very essence of our core and being.      With that weighty premise in mind, ask yourself THIS question:  Have I ever wanted to abduct sheep (and cows and chickens) by using a small UFO to bully them into a bigger UFO?  If you answered yes, then:  A. You are probably a very bad person (or an alien); and B. You just might enjoy Flock!  I know I'M enjoying it, even if the experience is a tad frustrating at times (think ""♥♥♥♥ me, soooo close...do I really have to play this level AGAIN?"")...but on the whole, a very ""cute"" and cleverly-constructed puzzle game, and one that's not toooo hard (at least not so far...I'm up to level 15 or so).     Oh, and just in case you require further existential impetus:  MOST HILARIOUS SHEEP SOUND EFFECTS IN VIDEO GAME HISTORY.  And the music is pretty ♥♥♥♥in' groovy, too.  About the only thing it's severely lacking in is MONKEYS, but hey, you can't have everything (its longevity and replayability may also be up to some question, but for this price, you'd have to be an♥♥♥♥♥to complain)... Verdict: 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not really my style.  It's less a puzzle game, more a speed challenge.  Push the animals toward the mother ship, do your best to keep them from falling off a cliff or falling behind, and get the bare minimum there before the time runs out to seal your gold medal.  I don't think it's a bad game, so, strange as it may seem, I'm recommending it on a conditional basis.  If a more arcade-y, challenge-type game is what you're looking for have at it.  If you're wanting a cerebral experience, probably not.  (It does depend on how smart you are to begin with, I suppose.)			",36,2,1,5,2,0,5

												This game ist totally hillarious while being absolutely serious fun at the same time.All you have to do is chasing animals with your UFO to your mothership. Over time the levels get more difficult by adding obstacles, introducing various animal types to chase and even some enemies like wolves that can get really annoying while trying to do a double gold star rating on some of the levels.As a child I had a toy that was an enclosed A4 shaped plasctic case with a clear top covering filled with little plastic pieces that you had to push around with a little truck that was moved by using a magnet under the bottom of the case. Somehow this game reminds me of it.I had great fun with this thing during my childhood and man am a I having fun with this game here now.I can totally recommend this game to everybody who likes a deep challenge from a game that looks so cute while being brutally difficult at times to master.And the music ... you've got to listen to the music in the main menu. Man I love that sh*t oozing that 70's scifi flair out of every inch ...(Though I have to admit while it's perfectly playable with your standard X-Box Controller, playing with your keyboard and mouse could get a little bit complicated as the difficulty keeps rising in the higher levels making it nearly impossible to win the missions without a controller ... you know what? This game is the perfect excuse for you to finally get yourself a Controller too ... I'm serious!) Check the demo, have fun with it and then go an buy the game. It's totaly worth every penny they're asking for it. ",276,66,8,23,21,3,37

												The game is pretty fun, but by no means easy.It's difficulty lies most in the clumsiness which you can't avoid, being a spaceship herding sheep through obstacles in remote island locations. You're going to have a learning curve, but don't let it deter you. I'd play this game more often if I didn't have 30+ already from Steam and a handfull of go-to games among that number.
