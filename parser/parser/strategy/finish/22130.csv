NOTE 1:I think I clocked over 400 hours into this game but it was back in 2006 and before I joined Steam.NOTE 2:I'm well aware that this game has a great sequel (Hearts of Iron 3) and some people suggested I give it (Hearts of Iron 2) a thumbs down because of its age. In my opinion this is unfair. During its time, this was one of the most advanced grand strategy games around, thumbing it down because of its age is like denying that it ever existed. So why would you buy an older title? Don't know, its ultimately your money and your call. =)TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Hearts of Iron 2: Doomsday / Armageddon is a grand strategy political war game developed by the grand strategy masters from Paradox Development Studios and published by Paradox Interactive. Unlike its siblings (Europa Universalis, Victoria, Crusader Kings etc.) in this niche genre, the Hearts of Iron franchise covers a more modern timeline by covering the Second World War and the early parts of the Cold War (if playing the expansion Armageddon).Players can take command of ANY of the 175 playable Nations and rewrite history as it unfolds. The game features major historical events, world situation and military leaders, and most importantly, historically accurate technologies and armies.PROS:+ The World Map is your playground+ Historical Accuracy on leaders, events, technologies and provinces that allows players to...(see below)+ Make their own alternate history+ Very complex and in-depth economy and resource management system+ Very complex and in-depth technology tree+ Brutal difficulty levels+ Extensive replayability (over 175 playable nations)+ Easy to mod (specially if the player wants the historically accurate flag of 1936 Germany)CONS:- Resolution locked at 1024x768 (No HD support)- Very steep learning curve- Tutorial, though extensive, does not cover even half of the game's mechanics (you'll have to learn the other half through trial and error)- Some historic events sometimes do not trigger properly- AI can be dodgy- Hotkeys can't be rebound (you can see a hotkey list from the manual)CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME if you're the type of player that likes long term strategic planning and don't mind occasional wars of attrition. The game features a historically accurate 1936-1964 world with appropriate nations, their technologies, economy and historic leaders. The empire management system is very detailed, in-depth and complex that may require some time to learn and master. The graphics of the game are very simple but the easy to install mods that are available will certainly improve your experience.Grand Strategy games have a very niche audience and even among this audiences, each has their own preference of timeline. Some people like the Victorian age, Feudal Japan, Medieval Europe, Ancient Rome etc. Hearts of Iron 2 caters for those who like to play with the 20th century theme of World War 2 and the Cold War.This game is best purchased when it is on SALE. Its easier to learn than Hearts of Iron 3 in my opinion and it makes for a good collectors item for Grand Strategy players.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Real-time/pause global strategy game, based on the events of the midst of XX century, which resulted in the biggest bloodbath in known history. HoI2 still (like the first HoI) using engine from Europa Universalis 2, but this time, it was actually reworked accordingly to the game's main plan: choose country and prepare it by economical and political means to the oncoming WorldWar. So, major point is - every game of Hearts of Iron series was made with waging wars in mind. Diplomacy... exists, of course, but mostly as a very short intermezzo between Wagner's Valkyries making another fly-by.So far, the second volume of Hearts of Iron series is still the most successful and respected by all gaming community. I loved Europa Universalis 2, and of course, I was very happy with HoI2 when I first started it.There are, of course, tech troubles - like flickering screen bug, which kills this game for so many people. Or even if you're lucky one, and haven't met any blink with HoI 2 - there are AI mishaps, questionable features like obtuse air support and spamming pop-up messages... And by all means, the game never looked all fresh and new aesthetically. The visuals are very basic and rigid, obviously.So, the question: would I recommend the game now? If you're not new with Paradox games - sure, why not? The flickering bug seems fixed at moment (at least, for me). Newer HoI games presents different mechanics, especially the fourth volume - and while some features of the game were improved, others were messed badly. So, if you're up to to win WW2, but can't tolerate neither tons of micromanagement of HoI 3, nor cheating AI at HoI 4 - welcome back to the proven ground of world's nerds beloved warmongering grand strategy, Hearts of Iron, volume two.However, I wouldn't recommend to buy the game simply to broad your collection - especially if you, like me, wanting every game working and proving satisfaction on every single day. There are too many chances that this game won't start, or will be too difficult to manage.As of my personal overall rating, I'd say, 8 out of 10. Great game, still very interesting, if you're knowing the drill already. But it looks too plain, and seems too complex for the majority of nowadays players. So come prepared.

												The Game is pretty awesome, after you learn how to play it. It took me some time (and the help of a friend), but if you look for a strategy game that can possibly go on for like 2 days, here you have it.The only thing I don't really like is with steam. When starting the game per ""Play""(I think its called that in english, I'm german) you can choose between the standard game without the Addons and the ""real"" complete version. Starting the game any other way always starts the standard game.			",185,43,9,32,35,2,59

												Takes a while to understand, but once you grasp the basics, you become addicted. The possibilities are endless, allowing you to pick any nation during WW2 is a real plus. Wanna conquer China as Japan? Go Ahead! Wanna Invade California as Germany? Sure! Wanna conquer South America as Brazil, Go for it!The AI still functions well, and the option to change the game speed from very slow to very fast really helps when you are waiting for units to finishing building so that you can continue your world domination. However, the graphics are outdated, and you may encounter some unexpected crashes. I am running Windows 7, and I have encountered a few crashes, so definitely make sure that autosave is on. Also, the multiplayer match making service is down permanently. Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good WW2 Grand Strategy Game, but I recommend waiting until it goes on sale.			",147,24,1,27,33,0,56

Product received for free
												Good wargame that includes all the expansions. Using the included Armageddon expansion you play a campaign from 1936 to 1964 rather than it ending in 1947. It also gives you more gameplay options than just regular Hearts of Iron 2 and Doomsday such as Intelligence operations. So I prefer to play with that.If you have the Victoria Revolutions you can export your game save from that into this. So that gives a possible game spanning from 1835 to 1964.I would also recomend turning off the game sprites to use counters. These use the standard NATO symbols for unit types. It just looks so much better I feel and makes the not look dated.You can play as any nation of the time but it is in the context of a coming world war between ideologies. Perfectly possible to play as a minor nation allied with a major power. ""Winning the game"" is a case of wheter the Allies, Axis or Comintern win. Of course just play completely sandbox and just survive as a neutral nation.This game works alright on Windows 10 x64bit			",32,0,0,14,8,0,31

												This game will immerse you in the realities of WWII-era politics in the ultimate ""what-if"" scenario game. Re-write history as it should have been and step into the shoes of 1930s and '40s commanders from almost any nation on the globe. This game may not be as pretty as Hearts of Iron III, but it gives a deeper sense to diplomacy than vanilla HoI 3 by including more diplomatic options and starting the game with historic treaties that will make you think before you act from the very beginning.

												Hearts of Iron II is one of the best Grand Strategy games I have ever played. It's deep and detailed yet easy enough to learn. Keep in mind though, when I say easy, I mean easy for a Grand Strategy game, for the usual RTS player it still is quite a hill to climb.The big strategic elements are well made and fulfilling with lots to do in building your country up, fine tuning your army and position it just so. The expansions add tons to that with an expanded diplomacy system and a espionage system both of which, although not as good as the actual warfare, works fairly well.The tactical elements is where this game really shines. Spearheads, encirclements, it's all at your fingertips. Think you could have held off the German onslaught as France? Go do it.The music is of the usual high Paradox quality and the sounds and graphics does what little is needed.A great buy for any fan of Grand Strategy. A game that needs to be played.

												I love this game. The gameplay is hard and innovative. I can't wait to jump face first into some of the options, which is amazing, because there are just so many options! I've played (unsuccessfully) as Sweden and Argentina. But the losing was amazing, to see exactly where the issues with my strategy were and how things can fall apart. Each loss (I've gone down hard twice as Sweden and thrice as the Argentine) has left me annoyed, but at myself rather than against the game itself. A must have. The only things that get me down are a few technological issues given the age, mostly that I can't re-size it properly to my liking. It shows fine on my primary screen, but being unable to adjust the resolution means being unable to actually use my second screen and multitask properly. Despite this, I can't not give it at least two thumbs up. Intoxicatingly addictive.Now, to conquer the world as Canada...			",88,20,2,11,21,2,18

												The first Hearts of Iron was my introduction to the Grand Strategy genre and I've been hooked ever since. HO2 is the standard by which I compare all other games in the genre and I have yet to see a game surpass it to this day including the two sequels. The unit composition is rather basic and there are fewer resources to monitor compared to HO3 and HO4 which are two reasons I prefer HO2 to HO3. The only problem is the game stopped working correctly a few months ago after an update for Windows 10 and no amount of reinstalls and deletions could fix it. I'll have to research common solutions to the problem I'm having. Despite this Hearts of Iron 2 is my favorite game of all time up to this point.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												after playing over 250 hrs on this awsome game, it broke... every time i go into single player it crashes, not sure what is going on, I do know i was getting ready to invade german controled europe with nearly 200 divisions in 1942 but that shouldn't  break my game as far as i know. if having a large number of saves breaks the game i would like a way of deleting old saves to make room. however i dont think that is the problem so i an clueless as to what is going on, any suggestion would be helpfull and nice. thxIts an awsome game that broke, other than that i like it.

												Even though wondering ""What if?"" has always been a popular pastime for armchair generals, Paradox Interactive has stayed away from speculation. Franchises such as Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron feature authenticity so precise that you often feel like you're paging through a textbook. Playing geopolitical sims such as these should earn you credit toward a BA in History due to such a rigid ""just the facts, ma'am"" design philosophy. Until now, that is. Doomsday, a stand-alone expansion for World War II uber-simulation Hearts of Iron II, takes Paradox into the world of alternative history for the first time. And it succeeds in a big way, thanks to the seamless transition from a realistic depiction of the conflict between the Allies and the Axis to an imaginative look at how the tense early years of the Cold War could have unfolded. Gameplay feels too familiar to be entirely pleasing, especially if you've spent much of the past year running roughshod over Hitler or slapping around Stalin in the compulsively playable (well, once you ascended past the cliff-like learning curve) original game. But if you're looking for more of the same, this is a winning approach.There aren't any surprises here. The look and feel of the expansion match the original game right down to the shrill musical score and the lame fixed resolution of 1024x768. Doomsday is a standard expansion with fairly standard accoutrements. It includes a new campaign, along with odds and ends such as updated units, a US/USSR invasion-of-Japan scenario (although it must be said that the Soviets don't seem to help all that much), and a scenario editor. The centerpiece is a revamped grand campaign that lets you set a starting point between 1936 and 1945, and play to January 1, 1954. Choose to start with the Doomsday scenario in October, 1945, and you come onboard as the Allies are forced to defend Western Europe against the swarming Red Army by nuking Moscow. Nothing like getting things going with a bang.Moving the finish line into the 1950s redresses a problem with Hearts of Iron II. Earlier, campaigns ended abruptly too often. You'd be right in the middle of a big push into France or on the verge of finally deploying the A-bomb, and the game would wrap at the end of 1946 with a dissatisfying tallying of victory points. Wins seemed cheap at times, and losing could be really aggravating, particularly when the calendar, not the enemy, cut off your grand plan for world domination.Games still end a little brusquely; New Year's Day in 1954 arrives all too soon. But the additional years typically provide enough time to bring the cataclysmic war in Western Europe to a gratifying climax. There isn't quite enough time to wrap things up on a global scale, however. You get a sense of the Cold War's early tension as the race to develop nuclear weapons heats up through the later 1940s and early 1950s, although games usually seem to end before a nation emerges as the clear winner or has at least thoroughly nuked rivals into the Stone Age. Even though an extra few years would have been nice, you don't find yourself thinking ""I wonder what would happen six months from now?"" nearly as much as before at the end of campaigns.The additional seven years tacked on to Doomsday are tricked out with enough new units to enhance the feel that you're not quite playing Hearts of Iron II. Much of the advanced military hardware that characterized the Cold War is on offer here, including attack helicopters, nuclear submarines, H-bombs, ICBMs, surface-to-air missiles, advanced rocketry, jet aircraft, and so forth. If you could build it in the real world in the late 1940s and early 1950s, chances are you can research and build it here. All of the new hardware is overshadowed by the mad rush to split the atom and build an arsenal of nukes, though. Just as in the real Cold War, nuclear power dominates the scene no matter how much in-game alliances and events differ from those in the history books. That said, it's not easy to go all Dr. Strangelove. You need to put serious effort into tech to develop the H-bomb and the ICBMs required to deliver it to enemy cities, and that can be nearly impossible while a conventional war is ravaging Europe and Asia.Spend too much time on tech and not enough on production while guiding an Allied power such as the US or UK, and the massive Red Army could soon march into Paris. Conversely, while the Soviets can bypass production due to numerical superiority as the campaign gets started, they begin without nuclear technology and must race to acquire it before the clock runs out in 1953. In short, everything is balanced, and there are no simple answers to tactical questions.Intelligence further adds to the Cold War atmosphere. Oddly omitted from the original Hearts of Iron II, spies play a huge role here. They are crucial when it comes to the nuclear race, as well-placed agents can steal the technology needed to provide an atomic edge. Spies are particularly vital for the Soviets, who need to deploy them to catch up with the Allied ability to make enemy cities glow in the dark.But espionage isn't easy. Agents actively trying to steal tech, foment rebellion, sabotage industries, or assassinate enemy ministers are at great risk of being detected. The artificial intelligence does an impressive job picking off spies, so it is very difficult to play Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and gather information effectively. Spies can be sent in as sleepers in deep cover, but this limits the information provided, makes intel unreliable (an overrun Berlin taught us not to rely on sleeper intelligence about Soviet armor), and prevents you from pulling off major missions such as swiping tech blueprints.Basically, if you want more Hearts of Iron II, Doomsday is a great bet. It feels a bit too much like its big brother, but all of the speculative history, nuclear tension, and Cold War spice make it a great addition to Paradox's stable of strategy games. It's also a great bargain when you consider the sheer amount of game you get here for less than $20 and the extra hours you'll get out of what modders will undoubtedly create with the scenario editor.

You'll run into plenty of ""bang your head on the keyboard"" moments, but usually I find that it was caused by my strategic blunders. It does lack certain aspects of depth added in HOI3, but personally I love this one more than the sequel.

Ive played countless hours of it, and the very first game ""Hearst of Iron"" was MY very game ever to have on my pc as a child by an age of 8. At this day I´m 16 and I still enjoy a bunch out of this game, and there are so many different ways you can conquer your enemies! You can do unlimited different war styles and it´s an exellent game for ww2 enthusiast. For its price, well if youre unsatisfied about that go to Paradox own website or some other vendor and you might have found a game for your life. With so many countries to choose from, to a big open world to conquer you wont get in touch with everything until the day you die, it´s a guarantee that I give you!			",32,3,0,5,2,0,17
