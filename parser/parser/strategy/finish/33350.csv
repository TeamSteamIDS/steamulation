												Highly addictive colony management game, Venice adds some significant improvements to the original campaign. A forgiving, slow-burn strategy experience, for the most part, all though it can get more frantic on the higher difficulties. Still looks great, and is a superior experience to Anno 2070, the colder and more abstract sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9.5/10 (for the gold version)+ incredible presentation, although the game was released 3-4 years ago  it still looks great with incredible attention to detail, very functional zoom levels, incredible (best at the time of release) sea presentation+ good soundtrack, nice voice acting of the narrator+ gameplay wise, it's one of the best city building and economic simulation games ever created, the balance (most important factor in this genre) is wonderful, you never feel cheated, but as you progress the game becomes very complex and needs skill and attention and loooooots of time to succeed+ you can play for hours, the campaign of the main game is wonderful with a nice story with some twists, there are many scenarios to play and anno 1404 venice adds more challenges and hours to gameplay+ who needs battles in this kind of games? for those complaining about lack or simplicity of war in anno, i'm fine with what it is, there are some strategical options when battling, that make them less monotonous+/- very addicitve, can consume many hours of your life- sometimes it feels slow, since there is no button to accelerate time, but this is essential here to maintain the great balance the game has- trading in your warehouse should be more effective , seems you get profit by trading manually with one of your ships- music during gameplay can become tiresome, also npcs repeating the exact same phrase when you click on them can become tiresome as well			",2589,1195,98,302,313,25,396

												In the interests of clarity - I've owned the CD version of this for *Ages* and picked up the Steam version the very second it came back on sale.Where do I begin. This is probably -the- best Anno in the series. No, sod it, it IS the best Anno in the series. Deliciously complicated, wonderfully detailed, an artstyle that has an attention to detail that makes the very most of every texture and polygon going, and two distinct building architectures that compete for ""eyecandy"" status, both bringing with them a unique set of challenges and such lavish, luxurious gameplay. This is a game you sink into, hours will pass, trading routes will be planned, your empire will sprawl over many islands, your burgeoning populace will span two very distinct spheres, goods interconnecting between them, as you work your way up through the citizen levels. Familiar terrain to any Anno player.This one stands out in the purity of execution, and in the sheer attention to detail and balance provided, everything fits together in increasingly complex interlocking resource puzzles, yet it's like watching a perfect piece of clockwork when you've got it all running, your empire gradually pushing against the limits of your ability to keep it supplied and happy, and so gradually you expand, seeking out more resources, adding more ships and more trade. In particular you'll deal with two very different land types, the fertile green grasslands of the north and the dunes and sands of the south, both have very different challenges attatched, and both bring with them markedly different styles and looks. Wandering through the deliciously Arabic buildings as your southern cities grow is one of many highpoints.Graphically this game is a looker, the spectacle is in the sheer detail, it's not a game that does explosions or anything like that, but you'll find yourself sitting back and watching the waves lapping against the shore (the water effects in this game are gorgeous), the gentle sway of the trees, the people going about their daily lives, the inherent detailing of the buildings, it all comes together in a way that not even Anno 2070 could quite manage.The Venice addon which comes with the Gold package is, like the deep oceans expansion for 2070, all but necessary, providing a root to branch expansion of the game as well as many quality of life improvements that flesh out the game in continuous mode. It also further expands the diplomacy and espionage options, giving you plenty of covert and subtle options to convert islands to your cause, as well as opening the option to economically dominate a game by *buying out* competing islands with keys to the city.Sound too, is a genuine high point, the music is reasonable but not anything that'll stick in your mind, it's the -atmospheric- sounds that are the real winner here, again, it's the little things, zoom in and listen near buildings, and you'll hear precisely what I mean. This game drips with atmosphere, both visual and audial, it does not spare any expense in this matter. The voice acting of the somewhat cartoony but excellently animated talking head figures you'll be interacting with is also of a superb standard, occasionally tending toward the dramatic, but always memorable.Weak points? It's an Anno game, and as such Combat is at best rudimentary, this is a game that encourages sly diplomacy and economic domination, getting the guns out is the last resort and naval combat is a sheer numbers game, but long time Anno fans won't be put off by this and should already be grabbing this as quick as they can. To everyone else, if you're looking for a resource management slash empire building game that revels in detail, trade, and intricacy, your prayers have been answered, the dawn of discovery awaits.It's very important to note that whilst 1404 gold comes with both the original and Venice, there's absolutely no real reason to run the original, since all that does is infest your system with TAGES drivers, and offers you a more limited experience. Running Venice in admin mode from the source folder the first time will solve your problems completely, and from that point on the game will run smoothly and you'll be able to enjoy everything available. To that end I highly recommend googling the unofficial patch that's availble as that fixes up a lot of the translation bugs that Blue Byte missed, as well as restoring a lot of missing text, bringing the game up to a standard that it truly deserves.

												This game truly does capture the essence of the Renaissance world, whether it be the vibrant colours and sword wielding maniacs at the corsair lair, the mountain top ruins encompassed by desert, or the bustling streets of your own metropolis with your palace rising majestically above. You can see every single person under your rule going about they're lives on your islands. Another great thing is the postcard view which can make a small island appear to be a walled fortress city with a great forest around it and in the distance the smoke from mines can be seen.

A game that provides fun for many hours not only due to the well-prepared economic layer but also through brilliant visual and audio layer supported by a small dose of good humor.			",12,5,0,5,5,0,7

This is the game for you! (and Anno 1404 Vanilla)Attention: Recommend going on the web and finding the Unnoficial patch for this game... it makes the english version a lot better, by correcting some mistakes the devs made when they converted the german version to english (broken achievs, broken text, text not being present, etc)...P.S.: I loved this game so much, bought it on steam as well... before I had it on CD for Ubi alone :D			",96,17,21,25,45,1,95

												While this is/was one of my favourite city builders of all time, I cannot in good conscience recommend it at this moment.The Good:This game is clearly made for the completionists among us. The achievements give it hundreds of hours of playtime. The campaign is decent, the scenario's are better, but the game truly thrives on a highly adjustable continuous game which allows you to set your game up for achievement hunting. Resource management is the main focus of the game. In short the devs have made an amazing game.The Bad:While the game is made for completionists it draws them in while the publisher stabs you in the back with what can only be assumed is issues caused by faulty DRM. There are achievements which are only available in online sessions so you need to create an online profile. However. Making it to completion is impossible. Any crash/corrupted save process/doubt by Ubi can corrupt your online profile. You still have it sitting there, but when you try to start any game ""download failed"" is your answer. You can still see your profile you can still see your saves, nothing seems wrong but Ubi won't let you play. This has happened twice to me. The first time I gave up after a while of getting it fixed. I restarted this process this summer and about a month ago my online profile was corrupted. As of now (after contacting support numerous times) this issue has still not been fixed. On a sidenote, the last update introduced critical bugs in some quests, there is an unofficial patch available which fixed most of these.I urge you, don't support a publisher who keeps hypersensitive DRM in place but cuts support for those same people.ConclusionWhile Anno 1404 is a solid game, if you're a completionist like me, do yourselves a favor and pass on it. There are plenty of games which are just as good but are no source of aggravating disappointment.			",44,4,0,8,8,0,10

												I love this game, but as with everything Ubisoft has its fingers on, it comes with a host of problems. Not in the least the random loss of your online profiles, and thus the loss of all your progress.Ubisoft support is beyond unhelpful with these issues, so basically if you want to play, play local, don't create an online profile, because you'll be <bleep>ed all the way.Still, on local play, I'd definitely recommend this game.

												Beautiful is a good word to start this review with, or a reccomendation as it is.(Good idea is to youtube - anno 1404 soundtrack)With the expansion of venice (consider this expansion mandatory), and the time I spent playing this before it came to steam I have some 3-400 hours in it.Aaaand I still haven't completed the most difficult challange. My friend did however, some 80-90 hours just in that challange. This is game is mostly a singleplayer game. You can costumize it between a lullaby to a literal hell in difficulty that I think is quite unique for strategy games, or a city/economical simulator as this game actually is.The multiplayer have an awesome function. Two players controlls the same team, this allows you to both fully enjoy the game without haveing to pose a threat to eachother, and or make your team just very much more effective when facing a threat!I'm a big fan of the anno games. But 1404 is the golden standard, the game my mind wanders to as Anno is mentioned.Looking for a calm almost therapeutic experience or a rock hard challange that'll keep you on your toes without getting boored? Anno is that, and all between those extremes!			",101,16,2,7,16,1,36

												Anno 1404 Venice offers amazing fun. The setup is perfect:- First play the campaign missions to get to know the game;- Then choose between Scenario's or go strainght into the sandbox mode.The sandbox games are fully customizable, so every game will be different. The Multiplayer mode offers even more options, as games with human being will be different than with NPC's. It is unfortunately here that my only downside of this game appears. As the game is quite old, the Multiplayer system is not working ideally:- Your online profile can suddenly be corrupt and you will have to delete it (haven't found another fix yet);- You cannot always connect to every game, due to router settings. To enable this you would have to tweak your router settins, which is not something you should have to do to play a game.Other than that, the game is really worth the money. I have it for about 2 months now and are already above 150 hours game-time, so.. it's quite addictive.. :)			",10,0,0,0,1,0,2

												There's a weird PC political-religious vibe to this game. You're railroaded constantly towards the ""Sultan of the Orient"" by ""pious"" ""Lord Richard Northturd"" (-its *not optional* even in a continuous game) -to 'pay TRIBUTE'. ""Have you come to express your devotion to me?"" -Grand Vizier Beard.If you leave this tribute for too long, the voice-over of our Grand Vizier becomes positively annoyed at you. In the Camapign your job is to stop an evil Crusade by an evidently rotten christian Cardinal. Not sure how PC this was meant to be, but I hated these elements.The title is set exactly 49 years before the ruination of Constantinople by the Turks too which makes the PC elements more infuriating at least for me.On the whole Anno 1701 pips this one, despite the larger content here.And the credits were well worth a watch. False beards and voice-over thespian melodramas abound.			",39,11,0,32,27,0,49
