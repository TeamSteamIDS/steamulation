												Hmm... how should I put this?Imagine Arma, okay? Imagine all of the realism, immersion, tension that has Arma featured. Now, since Arma set in modern world, how about change them into WW2. Nice, isn't it? Alright, now change the FPS camera into isometric top down that can zoom in into your unit's scale.Now you get Men of War.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is my favorite game ever! In the single player it makes you feel cunning and smart but is still tough! While in the multiplayer you get annihilated. But the biggest and best feature of this game is... the editor! It is very useable and powerful you could use it for a great mission or you can just have silly fun! (Most of the time I'm doing the second) My only complaint is the defence missions! No matter what you do you either win or lose it's a matter of luck! When you have a line of defence and a enemy army there is nothing to do besides watch and hope it does well! But really this is a great game I would recommend this any day.			",55,2,0,7,17,0,28

												Strangely this game is like a direct continuation from Faces of War. No tutorials or anything. just the same graphics, interface (simplified a bit) and even some of the music. Pick it up and off you go. If you didnt play Faces of War you will have a small learning curve ahead of you but no worries. The simplified UI is good and hints still work. Game is nevertheless just as awesome as Faces of War. i have now completed the most entertaining and somewhat challenging Soviet campaign and i had a blast. Just try to ignore the laughable voice acting in cut-scene videos. It's the strategy and fun with a full physics engine that matters the most. This is how RTS should be done. Buy it. Ignore the age of the title. It is as fresh as a daisy even in 2015. If you can't decide which one to grab, this one or Faces of War i recommend Faces first as that one is heavily squad based. This game introduces reinforcements and multiple flashpoints you need to keep tabs on (pause key is more important than ever) and you have entire companies at your disposal. There is also the biggest negative about this game. In Faces of War your AI allies did the fighting and your men assisted in the flanks mostly. now you manage it all. Including reinforcement calling and placement.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is just the best strategy game I have ever played, maybe even the best game i have ever played. For those of you who dont know men of war is a real time strategy game where you can take direct controll over one of your units and play as him (works like a twin stick shooter).The whole series is just genious it has fun missions epic battles and even a little element of story.The missions are like a pazzle and you are basicly free to do the mission how ever you like for exemple: if you need to infiltrate a base you could try tom look for a hole on the fance,you could make a hole yourslef using an AT grenade,you could wait for enemy patrol try to steal theyr tank, you could try to snipe everyone in the base from far away or just try to just walk in from the main door.this review applies not only on the original men of war but on all the series.if you havent played it yet u should, no u MUST try it!

												I find Men of War to be the best in the series, I find it a big step up from faces of war, and I actually feel it's better than the newer Assault Squad games.it has a story albeit its read by someone who sounds like a history teacher, and some of the voice acting is pretty laughable, but this game has realistic physics, and a great ballistic system making  tank, and gun duels to be very exciting, and stressful!  Watching your tank rounds pinging off of a Panzer's armor is pretty scary, and Angles and armor thickness play a part in it too. I love that♥♥♥♥♥♥The difficulty, well...this series is known for it's difficulty and long missions, and I can easily say this is one of the hardest strategy games of the Real Time non base building type, the AI is exciting to play agaisnt.The graphics are not the best, but with some of the newer features on graphics cards, this game can be forced to look very nice,very advanced controls (you can even control your units like a shooter) and a fast (but scalable) paceAn incredibly underrated game, from an awesome series.Many compare it to COH but Men of War deserves some credit in the fact that they cover a wide range of weapons, units, and vehicles, with a much more advanced ballistic system, and a much more advanced control scheme,they also cover missions and scenarios not seen in other game along with it's varied  objectives that bounce you back and forth across the map it makes for a pretty exciting game. Much more than your average skirmish the computer war game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You captured the farm house and lost all your tanks, mind you, it's only about 10% of the map. That took you an hour. Some people would rage quit, but not you  You have half a dozen riflemen an assault squad leader. You take the point and mission objective tells you that you must now defend the farm house with what you have. The countdown begins, naturally, they are almost there. They are 3:00 minutes away. You try to repair your tankette, instruct two of your riflemen to move the machine gun towards the bushes and rifle through enemy casulties. You pick up a Panzerfaust and hide in the farm house.The enemy force come in and its a tank and a couple of squads. You are outnumbered and outgunned. You ran out of AT grenades and all you have is a Panzerfaust. Some people would rage quit, but not you. You take out a fifth of their forces, but most of your men are pinned. The tank is edging closer and closer. Its near the range of the AT infantry, you instruct your AT to take out the tank. Of course this is too important of a task to assign to the AI so you take personal control of the infantry. He jumps out of hiding he fumbles for his panzer. (Did you forget to put away your rifle before blowing your cover?) Your infantry takes the panzer out, loads it up and... gets gunned down by the tanks nachine gunner. Some people would rage quit, but not you. You lose the battle. You declare defeat. If you are the person who thinks how they can improve, likes a challenge and have the time this game is for you. If you'd quit because things didn't go your way, this is not for you. The story and kind of game you have is a sort of RTS epic that you will be hard pressed to find elsewhere. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a big ""offline"" gamer, meaning I don't typically play games for the multiplayer, so this review is based on the offline features. The campaign 8/10, story is cool, missions are awesome, the option to play 3 campaigns, incredible, the diversity from one mission to the next? Outstanding. Unlike COH2 where all you do is defend objectives, or wipe out enemy strongholds, which gets old, you have a different scenario on your hands every mission. Level editor? 10/10 Love it! I spend most of my time in the editor! It allows you to create any kind of battle you'd like! Want to defend an airfield? Boom! There you go! (With a little help from youtube this should be quite simple to figure out) Want to assault a German fortress? Build it, then blow it! Want to create a chaotic battle between every faction in the game? Spawn the units, start the editor, and there you have it! And last but not least the skirmish capabilities! 0/10 There aren't any. If you want to battle an A.I. you'll have to play Level Editor. Final Grade: 6.5/10 (Just so you know if it says I have no play time on this game, it's because it doesn't record the time you play while disconnected from the internet.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You may think this game is good at first. You may think that me having clocked in over 200 hours means it must be good. But really, this game is like cocaine. You'll use it once, think it's interesting, then keep going. Soon you'll know it's bad, and that it's just constantly killing you, but you'll keep going, hoping it'll go back to the good it once seemed to be. If you're lucky like me, you'll escape and never play this again.Let me explain my opinion a little more. This game is essentially an RTS with guns, tanks and artillery. That's fun and fine in itself, at least on paper, but it necessitates a few things. For example, if you have troops with guns, you expect that they'll be able to shoot enemies, and generally get things done without your constant aid. Not in Men of War. Your troops will frequently throw grenades into their own squads, waste ammo shooting at nothing (yeah, you have to keep track of every troop's ammo), miss enemies at point blank range, stare at the last sighted enemy even if they're miles out of range, stop running in favor of standing in a field trying to shoot an invisible sniper, or just flat out do something that makes no sense. This is only the beginning.Your tanks fare even worse. There is literally no way to use them apart from taking direct control of the tank, the AI for it is that useless. This limits you to having pretty much one tank on the battlefield at a time. This would be reasonable, except that the game's terribly designed engine starts to really kick in now. Even while you desperately try to aim at an enemy vehicle, your shots will typically bounce off, or just flatout prove useless, while later, while not even trying, a .50 cal will destroy the same tank with ease. The game is just littered with inconsistencies, all the while trying desperately to cling to realism. And once again, this is just the beginning.In trying to move away, so as to hopefully avoid some shots, you'll find that the terrain is just as poorly built. Tanks will simply stop at steep inclines, and will actually become a physics object upon colliding with a rock, juttering out of control for a crucial second or two, regardless of how hard your brushed against it, while it will have no problem pummelling through a block of buildings. Speaking of buildings, some, and it seems more or less entirely random, will never be properly broken and will stay standing even after you've barraged the area with artillery, while some will crumble after a few grenades come near it.There's also a huge issue with balance, with the Soviets (possibly in accordance with reality) getting not only the best tanks, but also getting them the cheapest. Forget what you've heard about American tanks being cheap, they are the most expensive to field. Germany is the only nation that can compete; Japan and Britain might as well not be playable. In theory, the American infantry is better than the Soviet, but in practice this is only true for basic infantry. Elite infantry finds home with the Soviets again, who pretty much decimate all other units, until you bring in tanks, where once again, the Soviets take the cake. You'd think maybe some artillery would take out them out, but it proves rather fruitless, because they also get very good light vehicles, which will take out whatever artillery you have.This is all without even getting into the abomination that is the single player mode. The voice acting is cringeworthy; nearly on par with Zelda CDI. The difficulty curves make no sense, ranging from Niagra Falls drops, to brick wall inclines, and there's an extremely shallow learning curve, with the tutorial teaching you only a quarter of what you actually need to know to play effectively. On top of that, the singleplayer AI is completely insane, relying more on fielding impossibly large amounts of units than actually being able to control any.But I could go on forever. I'm going to cut my time spent with this game short and now try my best never to think of it again. Do yourself a favour and don't ever touch this game.			",47,10,1,3,8,1,20

Men of War Review - Rating: 8.3/10General ImpressionMen of War is a pretty nice strategy game. The graphics look pretty old, the textures are not great either, but they suit Men of War, because it is the first Men of War ever created. The old looking of the graphics really make this game look like the first one ever off a sequel, so I personally don’t see it as a negative point. Plus that strategy games weren’t looking great back then either. The atmosphere mostly happens in open fields, villages, cities, forests, and even other environments. The audio is pretty nice. I like the sound of the guns, tanks, etc. The music is very nice, it will always keep you with the wish to kill your enemy. The voice acting is very good as well. The gameplay is complex, in each mission you have to accomplish some tasks, alike killing certain enemies, cleaning fields off enemies, destroying some units, reaching a point, capturing a point, holding off certain positions, etc. The story focuses on the Soviet, Allied or German forces. They will have many battles in the 19 missions available, some of them being the Bonus ones, in the 4th and last campaign. The cut scenes of the missions are also pretty nice. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and well-synthetized information. I also like the overall design of it. The controls are pretty good, except with 1 thing: the rotations’ controls of the cameras. I highly recommend you to reset them with the arrow buttons. The engines, just like in every Men of War game, are not perfect. The game has rarely crashes, and when it crashes, you obviously lose the progress of your mission. Try and save the game as often as you can, in order to avoid too much progress lose. You don't want to waste your time by restarting the mission from zero, right? The mechanics are sophisticated, being pretty nice and everything moves well-optimized. Now, I’m going to talk a little about the G.E.M. editor. Just like in every Men of War game, you have a G.E.M. editor. You can create your own battles in it. It is complex and with a various number of functions. What I don’t like in this particular G.E.M. editor: the amount of content. Compared to Men of War: Assault Squad 1 and 2, this game has less content, especially in the G.E.M. editor. But overall, the G.EM. editor is pretty nice, still. Overall this game is a pretty nice simulations of the battles of the Soviet, Allied and German forces during World War 2.Positive PointsPretty nice and well-designed graphics and texturesPretty nice audio and nice musicFun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the 4 campaigns availableInfantry, heavy guns, batteries, cannons, vehicles, tanks, airplanes, and many other units available 3 difficulties availableA pretty nice designed user interface, and some well-deisgned cutscenesSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNeutral PointsTrading cards would be a nice featureMore units would be awesomeThe editor should have more content, including being able to drive airplanesNegative PointsThe multiplayer is not alive anymoreThere are some rare crashes, like in all the Men of War games ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Men of War is a fantastic game with great realism qualities like shot penetration capabilities and historical weaponry.  The faults of this game would be its sometimes horrible AI pathing issues and game balance.  The multiplayer experience also comes with five interesting and each unique countries with highly detailed weapons and tanks.  The campaign is great if you ignore the terrible voice acting but otherwise it makes a challenging yet fun experience.  Men of War has a somewhat steep learning curb but once you get past it you will be on your way to being a succesfull commander.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can almost hide on every spot on the map! You can repair tanks (even the enemy ones!). And Multiplayer is simply badass when you play combat.

												****  4 out of 5 stars in my opinion.Yes, I really enjoyed playing this game. Graphics, for 2009, are quite good, explosions are well done, and it is played in real-time. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is smart, but can be overcome as it tends to repeat most of its moves at each mission restart (predictability). But, you will be CHALLENGED to get through some of the missions and strategy will be required as the enemy will change its strategy in ways that you may not expect. The AI will provide some ""surprises"" which makes it entertaining. It will keep you alert (situation awareness) and busy planning your strategy. I found it to be quite ENGAGING and felt determined to finish it - and did. It has been 5 years since I played it, but I remember it as one of my favorites in this genre. Try the DEMO and decide.

												This game is brilliant.I know that's not a proper review so let's go into more detail: this game is really ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.Okay seriously now...I have just spent 27 hours completing the first campaign with the Soviets, on normal. Yes that is my entire playtime. No I do not suck at wargames. This game is hard, and not always for the right reasons. Aside from the fact that I traditionally play as a virtual Montgomery (yes, the WWII Field Marshal known for his caution and methodical attacking strategy), Men of War throws things at you that I guarantee you you've never seen in any other WWII RTS. Let's get the bad out of the way first, so we can gorge on the good for dessert.If you don't like micro-management of units in an RTS, steer clear of this game. I personally consider this a good aspect of the game, but because it's on such an intense and vast scale, it can be...overwhelming. You may be in command of many dozens of men at any one time and because each and every individual gets their own inventory (more on that later), that's dozens of people whose weapons and ammo loadouts you generally need to keep an eye on.What really gets on my nerves, and will get on yours, are the small terrain bugs. This is a problem that applies mainly to vehicles and large equipment like anti-tank guns. This may be a tech constraint more than anything else but it seems where they've tried to map out terrain accurately, they've ended up not quite getting it right, so your vehicles/equipment sometimes end up going very, very slowly over pieces of terrain that are not completely smooth. The whole issue is a minor thorn in your leg but it's still bothersome.Finally, the game is often difficult because you are given barebones assistance in terms of objectives. To be clear, yes you are given objectives and yes there's a red arrow that points to objectives during missions. But it's a thick red ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that really only points to the general region of your objective rather than the specific item or area, and your objectives are not always explained clearly enough. What I mean by that is, the game tells you what to do but it doesn't do it specifically enough. Minor spoiler ahead if you want more of an explanation on that: Take the final mission of the Soviet campaign for instance. There's a point in it where you have to release a submarine from a small pen and the game instructs you to do this, but not how to do it. I spent ten to fifteen minutes trying to figure it out, launching Panzerfausts at the dock power station, thinking blowing it up would achieve my aim (and because it usually does in many WWII RTS games- silly me). It doesn't, and I'm left puzzled as to what I need to do. Turns out there's a small console on one of the power pylons which will open the gate to the pen. GO FIGURE.Now, if you can at least tolerate all that then please, please, stay for the brilliance.Anyone who is familiar with games like Company of Heroes will feel right at home with this game. Only you're not at home because THIS. IS. MEN OF WAR. First thing you might notice is how there's no base. Instead you're given a complement of troops each mission. Every single soldier you can click on has their own inventory box. Literally every single one. They can pick up [and use] most anything and everything you can find on the battlefield, ranging from helmets and grenades to ammunition boxes and rocket launchers. You could probably play this game as some kind of Inventory Collection Simulator 2009. Now, the best thing about this is essentially unit customization.You cannot customize the looks of your men but by ♥♥♥♥ you can customize damn near everything else. Want to go into battle with a squad of bazooka-armed Nazi officers? Done. Want to strip your men to the bare bones and send them into battle as nothing but trained martial artists? You're covered there. Just want to craft a well-armed, well-rounded squad with rifles and a couple of light machine guns? Go for it! The game practically begs you to do this and the system is self-perpetuating because EVERY SINGLE soldier on the battlefield has their own inventory, even your opponents. On a special forces mission and in need of some heavier weapons? Tough luck. Oh wait, I can hear the deep growl of a truck coming this way, get ready lads...Another highly celebrated feature of this game is the Direct Control system. Using this you can essentially play through entire missions as one soldier or one vehicle. The system does precisely what it claims to do and gives you control over a single entity in the game, thereafter moving it around with the arrow keys and aiming/shooting with the mouse. This is not only massive bucketfuls of fun but it's paticularly useful if you want to accomplish specific tasks or turn the tide in a small tactical skirmish. I can't explain in words how satisfying it is to have one of your squads in trouble, losing men fast, only for their prayers to be answered as YOU turn the corner in a T-34, traverse the turret in the direction of your enemy and BOOM, ♥♥♥♥ YOU. Yes, the game has those moments, providing you want to make them. You can of course play this game completely as a traditional RTS and it's likely you'll spend more time directing squads and tanks at the strategic level than ""on the ground"". But it's those ""on the ground"" moments that really drive home the fun- ahem I mean, brutality of war. Graphics-wise the game is nothing particularly special. It was released in 2009 but it uses a slighly older engine so don't expect too much polish. You can still observe troops getting pulverized into a fine mist by 20mm FlaK fire, let's put it that way. Another great feature, though more minor in comparison to the others, is the way the game crafts what I like to think of as a ""persistent battlefield"". In most missions you will be accompanied by AI-controlled friendly troops. These guys all have their own programs and will get on with hurting the enemy wherever they can. They will even accomplish main game objectives for you in some instances. One mission I had, focused on the titanic struggle for the Seelowe Heights (anyone who knows their history will know this is a particularly bloody episode in the book of WWII) in 1945, ended up with me relying on my AI friends to clear out the enemy towards the end of the mission, as every assault I made had been pummeled into near nothingness and I ended up having no reserves left to commit. Instead, all I had left was one squad of tank crewmen.Now, if there's one thing this game teaches you like nothing else ever will, it's that failure is not the end. Only the beginning. This is where anecdotal value really comes into its own...You know what I did with that tank squad? Yeah that's right. Instead of giving up I searched the battlefield and, lo and behold, found myself a Mark IV Panzer that still had all its parts on the same vehicle (as opposed for instance to the turret being found hundreds of metres away having been blown clean off). With a heart full of vengeance, I commanded my squad to retrieve a repair kit from the inventory of an earlier destroyed T-34 and set about repairing the Panzer. My crewmen and I looked in disgust at the white cross. ""We'll drape a red flag over that cross soon enough brothers"", thought I. In minutes, to my deep satisfaction, my crewmen had a fully functioning Panzer, armed with a 75mm main gun on the turret and the deadly MG-34 in the hull and coax positions.I would love to finish that story (the bulk of it is we unleashed that vengeance) but Steam only lets me type so many letters. Anyway, the point is, if you hadn't already got it, this game is a main course of amazing with a starter of hard and a side order of occasionally frustrating. Do yourself a favour and buy it.

												This is a great game. It has probably about the most realistic gameplay you will ever get from an RTS and it can be very fun to play. Watch out though, although not incredibly complicated it IS a hard game, even more so if you, like me, refuse to play on easy. Ever.Although the voice-acting is terrible, the graphics are aged and the interface is not to write home about either, making the micromanagement (which is pretty much something you are constantly doing when playing Men of War) a little frustrating at times, the gameplay overall is really good. Also, it makes it all the more rewarding when successfully finishing a mission.The singleplayer covers 3 campaigns (Soviet, German, Allied), consisting out of 19 missions total, and 5 non-linear bonus missions. As of now, I am busy doing the Soviet one, which will probably take me quite some time to finish, for the missions are really long and hard. The storylines cover some of the less famous battles of WW2, all squad-based.All in all, if a challenging and realistic (relatively) modern warfare RTS is what you are looking for, you cannot go wrong with Men of War, even more so with the ridiculous price tag of €5,-. Less if you buy it on sale and/or in a package. Men of War is a VERY unique RTS and probably one of the best I ever played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent WWII simulator, with unparalled strategic combat. You can command a single soldier, and loot the battlefield, or platoons and parade them into the storm. Create the ultimate defenses by creating walls of sandbags and camoflauging artillery along roads. If you enjoy historic, strategy, WWII or just destroying your friends in game, then pick up a copy of this game, I got it on sale, but it's indefinately worth 10.00$. Because servers are down, directly connecting to friends is the only way to play multiplayer, but even if your friends don't own a copy I'm always up to play.Come; fight with or against me.

												I recomend this classic and epic game i have played for years. This game is definetly a 10 out of 10 and 5 of 5 stars. you will not be dissapointet if you going to like a high replay abilty. (play and doing your missions in your way or with the craziest tactics you can ever think of)The diffuculty changes from camaping to campaing and missions to missions too. from easy to the imposseble. (depening on your tactics)You can do stealth in Men of War and it is relaible, not like an another RtS game has to fired on many times while here you can take them out with a one single silent hit.They include an advanced system for vechiles that let you see the shells bounce off from shots to shots.And best of all, direct fire. controll your aim on your selected solider or tank and shoot to get the kills and make an advantage on your battlefield.Men of War has is hard to learn in the start, my exsperience when i first played the mission number one, i failed endlessy. when i devolopet a tactic that will work it began to be more and more advanced, while i am imroving for hours and hours. Men of war might not be for evryone but if you loved to play Company of Heroes you would defenitly like this one.I definetly recommend you to try out Demo if you are not sure about to buy Men of War. I palyed 1 month on the demo for i was adicted to the game. And thats why i think you will not be dissapointed.			",116,4,0,20,13,0,27

												This game is actually pretty good. There's alot of unit variation and serves its role as a WWII game well. This is very different from most RTS games, as enemies drop armour, bandages, ammo and guns, so you can command units to loot dead corpses.Tanks are very powerful, like they were in WWII, seemingly unstoppable.However, this game is very hard, I ended up getting a refund because it was so hard. Before buying this, finish the demo version. I played on easy mode and it seemed impossible. This was also the first mission, 4th objective.Its overall very good, but really hard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Men of War is a great game. The campaign is challenging and offers a wide array of units, strategies and tactics. MoW also features multiplayer and LAN so you can play in games with up to 16 people. The game also comes with a free mission editor so you can create your own maps and missions. Okay the AI is quite bad and the voice overs aren't perfect but over all this is a spectacular game with rich and diverse gameplay.			",187,35,1,14,13,0,21

												A very fun game with all of the operations of war in WW2 from Operation barbarossa in the East and the battle of the pacific (only Japan in multiplayer) to Operation overlord in the West and the battle of Africa. Online is incredibly fun with OP soviet tanks and artillery but damn good British and German infantry including the SAS and the Schutzstaffel. The US has funny US accents and the Japanese have kamikaze suicide bombers. You can fly planes and take control of individual units making it a tps - third person shooter, as well. Although I suck at flying as I don't know how to take off xD.

												This is still the best Men of War game made. The graphics may not be the best, and the voice acting is♥♥♥♥♥♥(hilariously), but this still trumps the other games by far. The only other game that is comparable is Faces of War, which was the game that came before MoW. MoW: Red Tide at least tried to stay close to it's roots, but suffered massively from the huge difficulty spike (compared to the original MoW) and the lack of any sort of Multiplayer (I mainly play single player games, but MoW was my exception). MoW: AS and MoW: AS2 completely changed the way the games were played previously. Changing it to more of a 'capture the flag' type game mode. Gone were the interesting characters, story, and missions. Instead you just get to play a bunch of scenario type maps that continually open up as you capture more 'flags'. That is not the MoW I enjoyed. Lastly, 1C decided to milk the series with a bunch of terrible spin-offs that I hope no one ever has to experience. The two most prominent ones being MoW: Vietnam (♥♥♥♥ing terrible game), and MoW: Condemned Heroes (which I never played, but have seen playthroughs of...it is terrible as well). They have also started to use the engine to allow a bunch of indie/small developers to make some MoW-lite games based in other periods (such as WW1, Civil War, and Modern times). None of these, however, have been able to stack up to the original Men of War. I don't understand why 1C decided to waste the success of Men of War on all these stupid spin-offs. They could have made a Men of War 2, just using the Modern engine, and with the same kind of experience MoW 1 had. But no, they'll just keep wasting the potential that Men of War had on these stupid games that are completely different from what Men of War originally was.Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8.5/10. It isn't perfect, and has many issues, but it is still the best game that the 'series' has come up with. It's just a shame that this will never see a proper sequel that will live up to it's name-sake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So realistic, I use this game to base other game's realism. It's both a fun sanbox and an intense command sim. Be prepared to be outwitted, brains over brauns here, as simple as the combat is it's up to you to turn a fight to your advantage. There is no win all weapon it's how you use it. For instance, I used to never spawn any vehicles other  than a puma, for this reason, every person I had to fight, would have a much slower and less agile counterpart. Simply hide the puma behind a building lets say, send infantry to distract his piece of steel, send in the puma when he isn't looking, and there you go you just wrecked a 100 point tank with a  25 point scout vehicle. And you can't complain that it's just a scout, because in real war all options are open, and this game really gives you all options. MUST PLAY FOR STRATEGY LOVERS.			",190,25,5,18,20,1,23

												Easily one of the best RTS i have ever played. It is not for the faint of heart though. It has a more strategic depth to it compared to most RTS. You cant just hit a tank from the front and expect to blow it up. You have to attack its sides and and tracks to impair its movement and hit its weak points. It is a great game. Usually i play with just infantry to avoid vehicle combat. I would reccomend this game possibly get the new one assault squad it is probably better than this one however you cant go wrong with this one or assualt squad! Hopefully this helped!

												Men of War is one of the gaming industry's biggest accomplishments, settling once of for all the debate of whether games can be considered to be art. Men of War is one of gaming's first autobiographical games which follows the heavy metal band Manowar from their inception during the 1980s. The game has a beautiful opening scene wherein the player controls bassist Joey DeMaio while he snorts the biggest line of cocaine in his life while backstage at a Black Sabbath concert, and neglects to fulfill his duties as a sober fireworks manager. In this sequence the player must complete a series of quick-time-events in order to guide a stumbling Demaio into correctly setting off the fireworks in order to not burn the stage down. During this sequence the quick-time-events get harder to the point where the player cannot complete them, which reveals that Ross the Boss is right beside you and like a true bro, covers over for DeMaio and succeeds in not causing the death of Ronnie James Dio. DeMaio and Ross the Boss become best bros at that moment and start legendary metal band Manowar.The rest of the game is a re-tooled version of Activision's Guitar Hero, but all of the songs are from Manowar.

												I really liked this game. The singleplayer is fun with diversed missions that are time comsuming and rewarding. Some of them are really great especially with the Soviets. The stealth missions are pretty bad though and doesn't work very well. I spend like 10 hours trying to complete a US stealth mission and failed. I ended up using the cheats mod to complete it. Multiplayer is fun and the main focus of the game. The modes of the multiplayer are good and it runs smoothly on my computer. i spent most of my time there. It felt great to play with experienced players as I felt the battles with them were epic and grandiose. For $10 (£5.87) it was the best deal I feel I ever made on steam.

												One of the best, if not the best, WW2 tactical RTS. There is no base nor are there any resources to harvest/gather. All you have is specialized Infantry and the armoured vehicles to blow the whole map up, literally. Every single unit in the game has its own inventory space, so when you run out of ammo you better go loot it from the corpses and destroyed tanks. A combination of Commandos:Behind Enemy Lines and Sudden Strike, it delivers a refreshing perspective on RTS games. No single battle unfolds the same way twice, since the game engine and mechanics allow for a myriad of different approaches to completing your objectives.Highly recommended for experienced RTS players and WW2 battle enthusiasts ",109,6,1,7,11,3,18

												Men of War doesn't give much in terms of a ""quality"" story through cutscenes, but what it does give is a quality story through gameplay.  The in-depth mechanics and ability to direct-control a unit provide you with a deep personal connection to the soldiers on the battlefield.  The missions themselves are arduous; one false move can abruptly end things, but thankfully autosave is fairly merciful.  These high-stakes only reinforce the earlier point about a personal connection to units, you feel pride when your men of war overcome impossble odds through cunning planning and strategic use of grenades.Overall, it's very hard to get into due to some very tough early missions and a very confusing interface, but once you remove all expectations brought on by previous RTS games, you'll find something that's pure brilliance.

												Combine a solid single-player experience with in-depth stratagey gameplay that almost reaches RPG-levels of inventory managment, and the fact that this game is a modern classic as it was the first Men of War game (which is now a large series), this game is great. IF you prefer larger scale battles with a little less micro-managment, I would recommend Men of War Assault Squad 2. However, if you're looking for a solid single player game and don't want to bother with the rather excellent and always expanding Steam workshop for Assault Squad 2 (one of the best communities of developers out there), give the original Men of War a shot.

												An excellent game for cooperative play, as the game allows you to join up with 3 other of your buddies to battle thru every single mission from the single-player campaigns. There's a great deal of call for strategic and tactical teamwork, timing and use of wits. You can equip every trooper individually, use vehicles, commandeer enemy vehicles by killing the crew and fixing them up. The objectives for each mission range from plain assaulting enemy positions to stealthy approaches, mining, holding strategic positions until help arrives or your comrades have evacuated key personnel. There's hardly a dull moment, and albeit the translation leaves something to be desired, the game is top-notch otherwise. Heartily recommended for fans of RTS games.			",129,33,0,37,14,1,30

The realism is kind of cool, and the fact that you can command a soldier/AT gun/tank personally to dig in and blow up unexpecting attackers is a very nice touch!

												I really like this strategic WW2 game.In depth organisation of your men, in depth control of their fire etc...Loved those massive battles with 6vs6 while all being in teamspeak.I even created a few maps for this game!			",400,88,16,59,36,4,46

												LOVE THIS GAME! I go back to Company of Heroes after playing Men of War, machine guns and explosions actually kill people! The campaign can be quite challenging but that is a good thing, several different ways to complete each mission and the campaign can be played in coop with up to 4 people!			",124,0,1,6,6,0,28

												Have you ever wanted to play a Second World War strategy game that tells you the name of every individual soldier under your command?This is not that game.This is a Second World War strategy game that lets you choose the weapon of every soldier under your command, lets you choose what hat they wear, what pile of rubble they will hide behind, what kind of grenade that they will throw and what kind of ammo your tanks will fire. And then it tells you the name of every soldier under your command.Then a mortar shell lands, and kills the man whose weapon you just changed, the man whose hat you just decided on, the man who you just ordered to take cover, the man whose name you just found out.So you then call in another group of names to remember . . .Oh yeah, and the voice acting is terrible.

												Men of war is by far the BEST RTS that has been made. This game is as simple or as complex as you want it to be. You can control every unit down to the lone rifle soldier and have him pull a machine gun off a tank and use it. Every thing has an inventory and can be extensivly microed. This game is one of the most rewarding experiances you can have playing a game IMO. Highly reccomended.			",266,30,0,24,24,0,46

With that said good luck. You're going to need it. This is war. You must have your ducks lined in a row, and deal your cards right. Learn how to use the camera, and develope good strats. You just might make it. With that said... I like this game good WWII RTS, Nice voice acting. You get to play as both allies, and axis. Even better! Afrika Korps!			",44,2,0,0,1,0,5

												It's a really fun stragety game that is easy to learn and use despite it being a rather complex game in comparison to other stragety games. If you like Company of Heroes you'll love Men of War, especially if you're not entirely into having to build bases. The voice acting is hilariously bad, but the campaign is challenging and fun, and multiplayer is all around fun with your friends, especially since you can play campaign cooperatively.

												I would have liked to recommend Men of War, but I'm way too frustrated with it. I've played through the five first missions in the Soviet campaign on normal, and that was fine. Then I ran into the brick wall that's called The Last stand - mission six out of nine in that campaign. I tried it on normal several times. I tried slowing the game down to the slowest possible for the duration of the game, also several times. I tried it on easy, and also slowing the game down to max on easy, but I'm way off completing this mission. It's soo frustrating! There is so much happening, and you have nowhere near enough resources to replace fallen soldiers and equipment. The developers are fine with this, they just say try again and you'll get there in the end - but no. NO! This is why you have difficulty settings. Tried the level you say? Tried it multiple times you say? Frustrated, and just want to get on with it? Ok, set it on easy, humiliate yourself just a tiny bit - but be able to continue on. In this game? Big nope.

												Men of War is the almost-classic installment in the Men of War series, Faces of War being the second and Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2 being the first. This is the first title with ""Men of War"". It has more modern graphics than its predecessors and has quite the long amount of missions. It also has bonus missions.Pros:- Realistic warfare simulator. Strategy matters and every little detail counts.- Has a long campaign with bonus missions.- Has nice graphics for its time.- Only game that has this level of creativity, detail, difficulty, realism and fun in a RTS.- Has an editor so you can make your own battles and mess around.- Lists of other cool things!Cons:- The micromanagement can get a little annoying.- The HUD is a mess.- Small AI bugs or random things(which are usually funny).- Well... thats about it.I have to recommend this game. If you have the money, consider the other story titles(Condemned Heroes, Red Tide, Vietnam) or the multiplayer based with SP skirmish missions titles Assualt Squad and Assualt Squad 2. That said, its worth trying out the earlier titles. There is mods that bring the Faces of War campaign and the Red Tide campaign to MOW AS2.			",161,22,1,17,23,1,37

												Do you like company of heroes, but feel like there is something missing, some actual depth or real strategy on the gameplay? Are you tired of seeing HP bars on tanks, making the game feel more like street fighter rather than a WW2 strategy game?Are you ready to take your micro skills to exhaustion while the game forces you to micro every single soldier to their tiny little inventory while controlling a massive platoon? No? Well I don't give a damn anyway.			",327,50,2,33,28,2,60

												An Company of Heroes weird Ukrainian type of game, perhaps is best to play this one before any company of heroes games. It has: building destruction, level editor, every soldier has a nice big inventory (like deus ex), and some other stuff make this game decent enough, the only bad part is voice acting and graphics, its a 2009 game but it doesn't look like one, it's an ukrainian small company so I understand, but again, for a cheap price is worth it.

Men of War requires a lot of patience and good friends to enjoy it. I recommend it because of its depth. The depth is also its greatest flaw.Both the campaign and multiplayer suffer from incompetent AI but the value in each unit assuages this. If you're dealing with a whole platoon things get messy. The biggest problem is that each unit has their own inventory, including ammo, helmets, hats, weapons, tools, and chickens.Yes, chickens.This feature causes a lot of frustration. The player must resupply and check up on each soldier and vehicle for them to continue fighting or else incompetence ensues. This micromanagement is the biggest flaw of Men of War and is one that's hard to get over. Leave units unattended, and they lose all of their organization. The units need the player to survive.Men of War's strength comes from Direct Control. Direct Control allows the player to use the mouse and kewyboard to move or shoot any of their tanks, troops, turrets, etc. Direct Control can make the difference in any battle because it lets creative combat take place. A well placed grenade thrown by a submachinegunner hidden in the rubble destroys a heavy tank's engine. An armoured car weaves through tight alleys and flanks a set of anti-tank guns. A machinegun set up at the right angle annihilates an entire squad.If you want a realistic RTS game that rewards creativity, buy Men of War. If you want a simple game, avoid it.			",90,12,0,15,7,0,9

												One of my favorite games of all time.In 2006, I bought a game called ""Faces of War"", a game that I loved and played all the time. It was a great game. And then, years later I found this. Men of War. This is the fantastic sequal to Faces of War.Pros:-The missions can be challenging-Mod support-Map editor included-Multiplayer (Co-op and PvP) (You have to use Game Ranger or Hamachi now though)-Many vehicles-Many units-Many gunsCons:-No AI in multiplayer, except for with the missions.-The game still doesn't seem to be very polished, this doesn't make the game bad, but it'd be nice to see the animations for getting into tanks to be complete so that they use hatches and such, some tanks do have this.-Lots of micromangement			",75,7,2,2,22,0,18

												An excellent and detailed RTS from Ukrainian developers. The control over units and tactical possibilities are mind-blowing, the damage model is realistic and encourages you to make careful and thought-through decisions. The single player campaign is a mix of Commandos and Company of Heroes combined with all the goodies I mentioned above.All in all: a must play, 10/10.			",134,30,4,31,14,1,34

												Never will you find an RTS with worse AI pathfinding.  Soldiers, tanks, and vehicles will drive in every possible direction except the one you told them to.  I guess it's an added realism feature to demostrate the lack of cohesive command and control communications which existed in the Red Army at the onset of Operation Barbarossa . . . or the devs just didn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite games of all time.In 2006, I bought a game called ""Faces of War"", a game that I loved and played all the time. It was a great game. And then, years later I found this. Men of War. This is the fantastic sequal to Faces of War.Pros:-The missions can be challenging-Mod support-Map editor included-Multiplayer (Co-op and PvP) (You have to use Game Ranger or Hamachi now though)-Many vehicles-Many units-Many gunsCons:-No AI in multiplayer, except for with the missions.-The game still doesn't seem to be very polished, this doesn't make the game bad, but it'd be nice to see the animations for getting into tanks to be complete so that they use hatches and such, some tanks do have this.-Lots of micromangement			",75,7,2,2,22,0,18

Gotta look for our informan before hand. Killed a guard by throwing a knife. Trying to pick his body. Body was too close to a building. Some invisible sleeping guard somewhat got alerted (yes invisible sleeping guard). Rushed out from le building. Alerted whole city. stealth/10 would throw knife again.No bugs for me, really enjoy the game (tho my record said 2.4 but I used to play this long time ago) believe me worth your money. specially on sale :p			",26,1,0,1,4,0,6

												I decided to have another play. Only when I clicked play nothing happened :-(  I like many others have upgraded to Win 10, so this had to be my problem. Time to give compatability mode a whirl, I had played the game on Win 7 but I decided to take it back Vista SP 2. Hope this helps anyone having problems as I did. To alter the compatability right click on ""mow.exe"" file in the men of war directory and chose ""Troubleshoot compatibility"" this will allow you to change the compatability of this file. I have tested and it works fine if you chose win 7 compatibility. :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Blow up a car next to 5 guys and kills them too, tank going out of control, and waves of riflemen getting gunned down by a few machine guns. Men of War puts RTS and a indepth game at the tip of your figureprints to play hours on end with no light at the end of the tunnel.			",103,9,7,10,38,1,23

												Being the first RTS I have played of this style, it does alot of things right. Voice acting, is not one of those things. The game gives you a set amount of units and expects you to fulfill each mission with those units. This often puts you in very tight positions that feel incredibly satsifying to get out of. Micromanagement and taking direct control of a unit are your strongest weapons in this game.			",235,14,5,31,16,0,44

												I would deffinitaily that this game series could be considered the dark souls of the rts genre. The campain is extremely difficult due to the fact that you units do not respawn and you can not summon or build more units throughout the campain, and when they die you will have to salvage their helmets, ammo, and weapons off of them in order to keep you force moving forward and well supplied. Another cool feature that factors into combat in this game is that wherever you hit an armored target it factors the damage you would do to it through the amour thickness, the side you hit it on, and the size of the round you are hitting it with. Then after all of that is factored into your attack, it can cause the armored target to become immobile, kill part of the crew, make it slower, disable the gun, or event destroy the armored target completly. Now although I found this game to be quite fun, it is not for the faint of heart as this game is extreamly hard and it took me quite a while to get past the first couple of levels. But, if you are looking for an rts with teeth that will laugh at you evertime you fail this game is for you. 8/10			",55,19,0,54,31,2,54

												While most of the ""good games"" come from big fancy American, Canadian and British companies,  Games that come from places like Russia, Poland and Ukraine are generally looked down upon. Men of War is one of those games from Eastern Europe.  And like Stalker and Metro 2033, this game is surprisingly good for being developed by a small Ukrainian based company.  This is a really strange RTS/RPGS/FPS Hybrid.  It's mainly a stragety game but it involves RPG elements like inventory management and such, theres also some features in there to take control of individual untis like an action game.The editor is fairly easy to use and the battles are extremley realistic, but fun at the same time.  If you can get used to the controls and how everything works, I highly reccommend tihs game to pretty much anyone who enjoys any kind of combat game.			",192,11,3,19,40,2,51

												I like this game and I only got it for a few dollars, but the voice acting is bad and I don't play RTS games for the story, mostly just to lead troops and watch epic fight scenes between units. Go buy Men of War: Assault Squad or Assault Squad 2 it has better graphics and if your like me it's just pure RTS gameplay focus.			",59,5,0,12,4,0,11

												Micromanagement: the game.Seriously, the temptation to play it like a crossbreed between Commandos and Panzer Commander is almost irresistible. But while under your direct control Hans and his crew just might rack up enough T-34 kills for an Iron cross, the rest of the front inevitably crumbles without your attention.Which is when you load your quicksave, turn on slow motion and start rapidly switching between Hans in his PzKpfw IV exchanging fire with a Soviet tank battalion, Kurt and his AT gun defending a crossroads, Uwe picking off the persistent infantry with his sniper rifle, Lars manning an MG42 and Otto crouching behind a corner with a magnetic mine in hand, waiting to take out the annoying KV-1 that keeps shrugging off Jürgen's PaK 36 shells like they aren't even there.Then the T-34 you were sure was dead manages to pull off one last shot that sets your engine on fire. A lucky HE shell rips your AT gun apart. Otto misses the KV by half a meter. Then everyone runs out of ammo and dies.10/10 would annihilate two German divisions using a capured Wirbelwind again.

												Hesitant to but this game since it was a few years old already by the time i got it. The Voice acting is terrible, amusing at times. The gameplay is more intense than your average RTS since you have to micro individual soldiers down the the weapon, ammo etc. The smaller the battle the more fun and involed it seems, can be very hectic and tedioius in larger maps. Campaign is interesting and kept me playing. If you like Company Of Heroes, give this game a shot, just a little more micro ing to to.  Overall a good WW2 RTS game,			",19,0,0,1,2,0,13

												I picked this up expecting something like World in Conflict or Company of Heroes. Instead, I found a game that required so much micro management that just getting a group of men to walk across a field required at least three button commands and constant attention. On some level, I can appreciate the attempt to model some of the complexity of real war - tanks have individual sections that can be damaged for different effects, all units have limited ammo for you to keep track of, enemies have angles of vision that you can exploit for flanking attacks, etc. But  the control interface and the AI of your units is so poor that constant micromanagement is necessary to keep your troops from getting slaughtered. The tank you get command of in the very first mission is a terribly powerful weapon, but mine got destroyed over and over because it wouldn't turn to attack targets I commanded it to hit. Pray tell, why do I need to individually command the vehicle to turn around, find an angle of fire, and shoot when other strategy games let you do all of that with one button press?

												This game is advertised as a real time strategy game, but it's not. It's more like a real time tactics game since you give units specific orders with specific inventories.Anyway, I can't advise buying this after just playing the first level. I know it's not much, but when:- Your units won't make decently intelligent decisions on cover fire and throwing grenades at machine gun nests or armored cars while the pause button requires unpausing and selecting new units manually to coordinate orders, - Your tank randomly doesn't aim or shoot at targets for dozens of seconds at a time while shooting endlessly at other targets until you manually turn the tank a little right before the infantry with a sticky bomb gets right up to the tank (by the way, did I mention that any excess squadmates just sit on your tank while getting shot at and that your tank takes damage just from moving around?), - The camera angle (not pitch) becomes a pain to handle, and - Mission objectives require hunting down every last guy in an area rather than those guys engaging you to prevent you from running over their comrades in arms......you know this game's bad. People will say that I'm just bad at the game, but the game actually just has really clumsy controls and doesn't respond to them half the time. It reminds me of that stupid Jagged Alliance series.If you want to play a decent real time tactics game, I'd suggest getting Fallout Tactics.EDIT: I've played the first mission a second time, and it wasn't as bad. That said, defeating the enemy was rather ridiculous. This time, it didn't respond to my grenade attacks at all, and just let itself get blasted. The enemy had no bazookas, and its AT guns just got wrecked. The hill I had to take was pointless as well since the infantry just rushed my tank which mowed them down with its machine guns, and the convoy either got blasted to bits, or just ran by my tank. It hardly engaged, and the light tanks which did engage hardly damaged my tank even though the tracks got disabled three times. Unlike the first time I played, I was actually able to repair the tracks multiple times as well.I don't know. The game seems to suffer from black or white thinking with little balance.

												This game has all the components of what a WWII RTS should be but executes them so poorly with too much micromanagement in a clunky UI.  I played the first level several times, I liked where it was headed but just couldn't sink myself into it.  If you're looking for Company of Heroes, go and play Company of Heroes, this one just hasn't quite executed completely yet.  I don't regret buying it by I wouldn't purchase it if I had the choice again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												THIS GAME WILL KICK YOUR BUTT!!!This game is not so much a game as it is a test of twitch reflexes and micromanagement. While technically an RTS, it is very different from Starcraft, Red Alert, or any other game in the genre. You have no base and you cannot create units. So you are stuck with what you get. Therefore you resources in MoW are your limited supply of men.This game is very very difficult. Even on easy, missions will take you many tries to beat. The learning curve is insanely steep - like Mt. Everest steep. To make matters worse, the tutorial like 5 minutes long and teaches you nothing about how to play the game. So you're left to figure how to play the game yourself by watching YouTube videos and reading online walkthroughs. After all the research, the controls will still bewilder you. There is no reliable way to get your troops to do what you want everytime. After much research and pratice you will still get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked repeatedly by the AI, since the missions are stacked against your favor. In many missions you basically just pray that your soldiers can survive the enemy's assault. In spite of all this, the game is still fun in a maschostic kind of way(hurts so good?). But I truly suggest, that most casual gamers do NOT buy this game at ANY price - as it won't be fun for you. Only hardcore fans of WWII and RTS games should buy Men of War. Other reviews are funny and witty and make the game seem kind of cool. DO NOT TRUST THEM! They make the game seem much more approachable then it really is.Pros:- Fully destructive environments- Can control vehicles as well as soldiers- Different variety of weaponsCons:- Very challenging missions- Terrible controls, with no tutorial- Horrible voice-acting- Weak storyline- Requires looting deadbodies or boxes to resupply ammo or items for EACH soldier.Conclusion:- Only for hardcore RTS or WWII game fans. Others will be putoff by the terrible controls and insane difficulty.			",31,5,0,3,0,0,7

												Really enjoyed Soldiers: Heroes of World War II, so I was thrilled to pick this up on Steam, but found it disappointing. When you have dozens of soldiers at your disposal (most of whom have moronic AI) it becomes tedious and frustrating to have to drag the camera all over the battlefield and micromanage them all.

 Originally posted on March 28, 2011 --- UPDATED REVIEW 10/26/2016 (see below) Men of War is certainly unique. In no other true RTS have I been able to (and indeed required to) manage the inventory of individual soldiers. Each soldier must carry a specific weapon which they may or may not be proficient at using, ammo, a helmet, bandages, and even knives or entrenchment tools. Each vehicle has fuel and ammo which can be replenished, and each seat must be manned by an individual soldier. Combine this with a fairly realistic ballistics and penetration model (infantry are REALLY vulnerable, and certain tanks simply cannot be penetrated by small rounds) and you have some very micro-heavy gameplay with a good degree of realism. The problem is that the AI is absolutely terrible in single player, and the game pits you against laughably sized hordes of them to compensate for it. While as a history nut I loved the amount of detail and flavor in the vehicles and weapons that were available, the AI and level design undoes almost all of this. The result is a massive amount of save whoring and gamey behavior to exploit the AI. In multiplayer, the variety of units and weaponry is much appreciated, but the gameplay itself is directionless. You can capture points, but nothing you do in game can change the steady stream of points you receive which allow you to unlock more units. The variety of units and size of maps means that there is a hugely wasted opportunity here, because as long as you have the points, you can buy the most advanced tank or infantry unit from the start. There's no hierarchy or sense of progression, and points are seemingly randomly scattered throughout the maps.Ultimately, Men of War has an appealing level of micro, but fails in terms of direction.UPDATED REVIEW 10/26/2016:After more than five years, I ended up playing Soldiers: Heroes of World War II, and replaying Men of War pretty extensively. Below are my thoughts.Pro:- While pretty much all of what I said regarding Men of War's excessive micromanagement is still true, I've come to see the insane level of detail as more of a positive. Especially after playing Soldiers first, I've come to appreciate the potential for creating your own narrative within Men of War's detailed sandboxes. I think you have to be the right kind of crazy to like this kind of thing, but once you do, its very addictive.- Sandbox gameplay increases replay value and encourages creativity.- Environmental destruction is impressive. I'd say it's actually more detail than Company of Heroes' system, even if it looks less cinematic at times. For example, walls can be destroyed in smaller chunks, and when buildings collapse they remain a part of the environment, providing cover instead of just becoming a giant obstacle.- The variety of historical vehicles is insane. As a history nerd, this pleases me enormously.- Campaigns are focused on lesser-known battles in WWII.Con:- Using Direct Control is still a requirement to beat most single player missions, when it should be just a neat feature. This is because of the incompetence of the AI - you simply can't leave your units unattended for very long, or expect them to make that crucial shot. You have to do it yourself.- The micro intensive nature of the game means that its easy to feel overwhelmed by the larger defense missions. This series feels most in touch with its roots when you are in control of just a squad or two.- Extensive save-whoring is still required to beat most missions.- The voice acting is horrible, and other RTS titles (Company of Heroes, Starcraft 2) are much better at using voice acting and cinematics to further the narrative.- Multiplayer modes pale in comparison to contemporaries such as Company of Heroes.Overall, I'd say the Men of War series is unlike any RTS I've played, and as I said, you have to be a certain kind of crazy to enjoy it. But it can be a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly this game is bad, im speaking of the base game, i do not have any of the addons but the base game itself is bad. the campaign is cookie cutter with defense missions that only rely on luck, not troop placement, not strategic thinking, just luck that your anti tank guns dont get blown up by a tank thats been hit 5 times in the same spot, thats another thing, the devs of this game have no clue how armor penetration works with tanks, if a kv-1 heavy tank has to spend 20+ ap rounds just to damage a treed, you dun ♥♥♥♥ed up. the micromanagement wouldnt be so bad... if they didnt give you 100+ guys all with inventorys you need to check to make sure they are not out of ammo, being a 2009 game you'd think they would have a system to pick up ammo themselves. i got this game because everyone said it was better and more realistic than company of heroes, after about 10 hours, all i could gather from this game is that tank battles are all based on luck and no realistic equation, hold out missions end with you getting swarmed in like 5 minutes, the ai are as bad as the 5 second running in call of duty, also, no skrimish kinda mode against ai? thats the first thing you need in an rts game, skrimish and multiplayer, yet all you get with this game is a single player game mode campaign that leaves alot to be desired. at this point i fail to see how this is more realistic than company of heroes, both are just as fake as the other, you want realism? go play company of heroes blitzkrieg mod, least that has done tank and infantry right. ALSO wtf is with the fuel system in this game, the german tanks had some of the worse mileage, yet the t-34 or the sherman can only go like 250 yards? i get its balancing but then theres no way to refuel the vehicle :l then why put fuel in?! tldr this game is bad, Coh Blitzkrieg mod is more realistic than this without the crappy micromanagement that is 100x worse than any other micromanage game iv ever played			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It could of been good but I guess with a small company at the time voice acting was not a big priority, and the voices sound awfull but the gameplay good, the deaths are excellent best I have witnesed in any game.But............. There is notutorial for newbies to the franchise like me just a couple of hints then it expects you to know the rest which is a horrible thing for a person to go through trying to get into what others have said is a masterpiece or brilliant game. Im not sure on Men Of War but It can be worth you're money as long as it is under $10 and you better change the settings as soon as you get it because when I started it up it was running good on windows 8 but made a small little box as the screen I had to change it to 1280 by 720 just to get a good screen but all well an alright buy better spending it on something else I would say unless like I said it is under $10 not $9.99 at least $7.00 or less.

												I played the demo and the second I found out that each individual soldier had their own inventory, I exited and bought the Men of War Bundle. I read a lot of reviews that said it's brutal in the difficulty sense, which is fine because I don’t mind difficult games. The game was fun at first; tough, but fun. Then I slowly began to realize the reason the game is so tough is because of how frustrating the AI is. Not so much enemy AI, but your own team. I really think the game could benefit from a pause button, since it is too difficult to micromanage all the soldiers that constantly make stupid decisions if left alone. If you played this game when you were younger, then I’m sure you’ll overlook the “quarks” and have a good time, but I just can’t recommend this game due to how frustrating it is. I am hoping the other games in the bundle I purchased (MoW: AS) have fixed or at least made it playable, because the series really has potential.			",50,2,0,3,14,0,22

												Here is my HONEST Review.Even though it released in 2009, it isn't actually advanced. Its actually WORSE than any of the Company of Heroes Games! I Love the CoH Franchise. I even had an old set of CoH keys I could use for steam. I was expecting the same from this. Sadly it's not so. I played the first level and a Lan Game. Its not as good. I have to put those who love this game down. I read 50 People's Reviews, Tommy the Jerk's one is probably the most accurate.Here is my List of Pros and Cons of CoH and Men of WarCompany of Heroes Pros:- Released in 2004 with a WWII setting that I considerto have Defined the WWII RTS Genre.- Had 2 Expansions that added multiple extras and new armies for munltiplayer and campaigns for singleplayer.- Has Got a steady defined and refined Modding Commnunity with mods for almost everyone.- Skirmishes. Just Skirmish the ever-living s**t outta Bots- I could go on all day, so the last Positive Pro:It had and has Hundreds, if not, THOUSANDS of Replay value.Men of War Pros:- Released in 2009, not much of a pro considering theCons.- Mixed Missions? I guess....- Online Matchmaking and servers.... I guess...- Realisim... I guess- 99 pence was a fair deal for the game.Company of Heroes Cons:- Released in 2004, Which, I admit, the graphics weren't that good. They were hard to tell at some points.- Sometimes the Matches I played on went down or juststopped from lag (This was rare though)- I didn't find out about the modding community untill 6years later. Q-Q- It's story, while great, wasn't perfect.Thats really the only ones I could think of.Men of War Cons:(Where do I begin, well...)- Released in 2009, With the best Graphics, still look worsethan CoH @ highest settings. Pitiful.- WHERE ARE THE SKIRMISHES!?!?! I  WANT TO BEAT BOTSDOWN TO A PULP WITH MY SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE!- It crashed on my best computer which is the equivelant ofan alienware. I had to use my less powerful one (which runs itperfectly at high settings still).- There are no select missions features in singleplayer (tomy knowledge at least). CoH had that.- The Menu, God, its too simple and It gave me a headachefrom bright colours.- I can't find any online games. Strange....- I could continue, but it'll be too rough to handle. Verdict:What Men of War Had, Company of Heroes had More, if not, TRUCKLOADS more content than this game.COMPANY OF HEROES RELEASED 5 YEARS EARLIER! They should have gone: ""Hmm, lets have a look atthe previous RTS that was sucessful and WWII based and We shall take inspiration from that!"".What actually happened: ""Oh, Company of Heroes was popular, LETS TAKE EVERYTHING FROM ITAND MAKE IT UTTER S**T!""Company of Heroes' Menu didn't give me a headache when I ran the game. MoW did.Company of Heroes' Graphics @ Highest settings beat MoW by a LONG shot.Company of Heroes had skirmish. THE ONE THING THAT COULD'VEMADE THIS GAME BETTER WAS SKIRMISH. Men of War Had A cheaper price when I got it, thats it.Men of War makes me despise Most WWII RTS games now.And DOOON'T GET ME STARTED ABOUT COMPARING THIS GAME TO COH2. TL;DRThis game isn't cancer, but you'd be better investing in Company of Heroes, thats for sure.This game doesn't have really many redeeming features about it other than its so called""Realisim"" if you call it that. Overall Scores:CoH: 9.5MoW: 6.5This game is ONLY recommended if you just want to add to your steam library.This game can barely shine a light agaisnt CoH1, but can ONLY shine a light TOCoH2. Overall-Overall: Not Recommended if you want to actually play, only recommeneded if you want to add to your vast steam library.Invest in any of the CoH games or Undertale. Or even garry's mod. MoW, is okay. not good or great, okay.			",410,123,12,88,55,8,85

""Kill your Darlings[www.goodreads.com]."" Yes, it is your life and blood (a baby ""darling"") but it really is mediocre. Maybe make something is original and never before seen. You guys surely have a talented team (on the technical side) but maybe buff up your creative side. To me a game is 25% visuals/technology and 75% gameplay and your gameplay is really lacking.

												The game was fun for the first level, after that its difficulty went mad high and you couldnt train any units, I expected the game to start with a base and where you could train units give them guns and such like that, no you have 3 campaigns and a few bonus missions, there wasnt a skirmish mode or anything like that, I expected the controls to be easy to understand, I was god awefully wrong, double shift double num 0 what... no just do all the normal keys not all this double press crap. Since there are only 3 campaigns, I dont think it will be that long of a game, nor will it be an everlasting fun game. It was made in 2009 and it does have good aspects and good gameplay, but the game shouldnt be any where near 15 dollars since its that old and has very poor voice acting, it was literally hilarious I was laughing out loud because of how bad the voice acting was. So, to wrap this up, if you like Age of Empires or any other stradegy game on the planet, do not buy this game, you will be madly dissapointed. A waste just like War Z was.			",166,10,1,18,16,0,22

												I do not recommend this title if you are expecting the WWII version of Age of Empires. This game is difficult when on easy because they do not give you enough men or equipment at the beginning of each mission. Each level is just a scenario where you begin at A and have to end at B, over and over.			",0,0,2,2,1,0,4

												It's probably just my own stupidity, but I just couldn't get into this game. It wasn't quite the level thatsome of the positive reviews put it at, but it's still a good game.I won't go into any detail, since I barely have the playtime to back it up, but if you want a 'very' old RTS style game, that reminds me of Warhammer in WWII, thebn this is your game.

												A superb tactical inventory management simulator. Men of War is at its best when it is exploring the intricacies of men carrying things.  Gripping shuffling-crap-back-and-forth action is, however, occasionally interrupted by other soldiers with different uniforms who show up at random and shoot at your own troops.  The only function of this feature, as far as I can tell, is to deplete your own ammunition; if one of your units dies it's either entirely shruggable or a nigh-mission-failure anyway, so it doesn't matter much.And ammunition micromanagement is what Men of War excels at.  It's enthralling to send a truck scurrying around the map to scrape up spare machine gun ammunition for your tank which is locked in combat with a large number of enemy soldiers who are unreasonably insistent upon its demise.  There is also tons of pixelhunting fun to be had trying to click on the thing you want to click on, with tension provided by the ever-present possibility of accidentally telling a soldier to take cover on the wrong side of a wall or do something similarly bat-guano stupid.  (I'm not sure why Steam says I don't recommend this game; honestly, it's the best man-to-man cartridge-counting game around.)			",104,33,14,26,44,3,63

												A real-time strategy game in which you have to micro soldiers, squads and tanks, manage their inventories (weapons, grenades) and destroy the enemy lines.This game has great potential. It requires actual tactical insight in combat to be able to complete missions. Unfortunately, the game mechanics are not only horrific, they are game breaking. The terrible inventory system management has even resulted in mission failures for me.Avoid this game serie entirely.			",104,18,2,10,16,0,20

												Interesting game ALOT of micromanaging all because the soldiers are either running right next to a tank to hit it with an AT bomb, or maybe an Anti-Tank gun is trying go through a building, and sometimes soldiers just decide sitting right next to a grenade is a good idea. But direct control can fix some of your issues and the only problem is you can only direct so much time into getting a AT gun out of a building without the enemy getting a tank through your defence. Later when I found out soldiers had seperate invertories great... well it was at first very time consuming to refill ammo because you had to give every soldier a portion of ammo but then I figured out that sqaud leaders will  share ammo with their squad which made it  alot less of a pain when they run out of ammo to restock. Overall it is a great game my only problems are on stealth missions they seem way to hard as the enemy seems to always find me but other than that no problems.Rating: 9/10			",140,14,1,9,15,1,28

												Very good game, once you get over the learning curve near the start. (slightly difficult, as there is no tutorial) But as soon as you get the hang of it, it can be very addictive, very realistic, and most importantly; very fun.If you're looking for a comparison, think Company of Heroes crossed with World in Conflict, with a little bit of Ghost Recon thrown in. They certainly pulled it off well! (Although, sadly the voice acting isn't on par with most of today's games, but that's hardly game-breaking by any standards)			",231,38,10,53,38,2,64

												One of my all time favorite strategy games.First, THE BAD:The Voice Acting - Id rather be listening to Nickelback.Learning curve - Second mission puts you in control of over 50 men. It's not noob friendly. This is a drawback for some but it's rewarding succeed in this game.Minor Gliches - Nothing game breaking but it's no StarCraft 2.Here's The Good:Direct control - allows you to take control of a specific unit (anything from a tank to a sniper).Realistic Tank Combat system - Seriously... it's amazing. The shot penetration depends on the angle, armor thickness, round size, and distance. This makes for some awesome in game moments where you can take out multiple Panzer III with a single KV-1.Old School Inventory system - This is a downside for some but I love having to drop ammo into each soldier, loading up tanks by dragging Shells from one unit to the other. It would be nice it there was a more steamlined way of doing this but being able to salvage higher teir weapons with extra riflemen can make all the difference in a mission.Dynamic Destruction - Huge explosions as well as craters and fully distructable buildings. What more do you need?Mission Veriaty - From huge frontline assults to night raids, this game has something for all.Don't take my word for it, try out the demo.			",76,7,4,8,25,0,21

												Just shooting enemies is the Missionary Position of Men of War. It gets the job done and its fun but there are about a hundred different ways to go at it.For example... How to kill a guard on a smoke break - Run him over in a vehicleStabDisarm enemy AP mine, rearm and place it then lure he and his squad over itCrush with environmental debris from explosions or with the burnt out husk of a destroyed enemy vehicle that you push like a bulldozer over him.Guns & GrenadesBare handedThrowing knife while hidden prone in tall grassAir Support & Artillary of several different varieties if availableAnd you may be thinking... ok yeah so what?. Well, the point is that this game offers all of that OR you can zoom out until infantry are the size of ants and control a column of tanks and armored vehicles in real time... then slow down time and zoom in to the drivers seat of one of your jeeps and make the driver get out and man a machine gun nest whose previous occupant was killed AND if you really think it through you can make that driver pull his jeep up to provide soft cover from one side to protect him from being flanked. Once defending against a wave of german armor I barely survived until reinforcements came, when they did I was allowed to call in heavy tanks and I did... when I took them to chase the germans accross a frozen river one of my largest tanks cracked the ice and fell in - then I realized I could break the ice to prevent their lighter armor from crossing.I was instructed to take a fortified position with a wave of infantry.I broke from the main group to comandeer a truck so I could hopefully pick up enough speed to make it over the trenches and then ram into the machine gunners sandbags with hopefully enough force to dislodge or kill him (this in itself says a lot as this isn't a canned animation or a suggested tactic, or a button - it's just something you figure out because the game apparently has a fairly robust implementation of object physics; destroyed vehicles sometimes explode and sometimes dont depending on what happened to them but if they do explode the pieces land wherever the force of the explosion takes them and then can be used as cover).

												A neat little game made for folks who enjoy micromanagement, and like bit more realistic stuffs. You can group your soldiers into groups, but can direct them independently of course. Ah, and all of them have their own inventories with ammo, weapons, grenades, and so forth. So, your average Joe can hold an SMG, an LMG, a rifle, and buttloads of grenades. Okay, it might not be entirely historically accurate, but gives the game some enjoyable moments as you can pick soldiers that will be assigned to special tasks as you take direct control of them - yep, this game has direct control. Press End, and your dreams can come true. It doesn't really work when you have multiple platoons to take care of, but on missions where you have just a small group of soldiers at your disposal, it's awesome. Also, direct controlled tanks are awesome - take aim, and disable enemy tanks' turrets. Enemy soldiers will leave the vehicle, and your MGs can easily take care of them. And then...Grand Theft Wehrmacht happens. Hop in with a single soldier, drive the tank back behind your lines, repair it, put some additional bods into it, and bam, you have a fully functional tank to crush your enemies and see them driven before you. Also, it saves reinforcements - if you are lucky and have some skills, you can finish maps without losing your own tanks and using only looted enemy vehicles. And, it's challenging. Even on Normal you'll have some hard times, if you are not too much into micromanagement, and you aren't a really freakin hardcore strategist. But if you learn the basics, you'll have really good times with this game, and feel growing desire to get each and every one of them. Sadly it lacks proper skirmish where you get a map and battle the AI, but there are enough missions to counter this. Sadly this game was supported by GameSpy, and I'm not sure if you can get it working with Hamachi, but it's worth a try if you and your friends are looking for some WW2 carnage. Especially recommended for wargamers.			",374,65,25,69,40,5,112

												Best game series ever. See a building? Blow it up with a well placed artillery/tank shell. No? How about ramming your ♥♥♥♥ing tank into it, taking it down with any other person inside? What about shrapnels? Do you like shrapnels? I ♥♥♥♥ing love shrapnels. All explosions are not based on the laughable spherical ""blast radiuses"" but on flying razors that can cut your men 7 ways to sunday. If one of your unlucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s happens to be having his head over the trench when an artillery shell hits his position or a grenade hits the top side, you better ♥♥♥♥ing hope he's wearing a helmet and ducking or else you're going to have to scoop that♥♥♥♥♥♥for a brain of his off the ground. Disabled an enemy tank? Oh my, well did you know that you can open its inventory, take out that machine gun and ammo, then blast the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the enemy? What about the fact that you can repair it on the field and use it as your own? What about the fact that EACH tank and vehicle has REALISTIC armor, sloping armor (that actually worK), and vital spots (ammo storage, fuel storage, etc.)? You can blow off their ♥♥♥♥ing tracks, turrets, and barrels for crying out loud! The vehicles do not operate on the basis of the Company of Heroes ""health bars"" but on the basis of reality. Soldiers do no damage with their rifles. Tanks get damaged based on where they hit with parts breaking down, hulls being pierced, and hulls being blown to bits.The game puts Company of Heroes to utter devastating shame. Get it. I prefer the older ones (Men of War, Men of War: Red Tide, etc.) as ammo and infantry are scarce, you are forced to scavenge, repair, and loot dead bodies for cartridges, tank shells, fuel, and so on. Good micromanagement.			",209,25,3,25,25,3,55

												Unforgiving World War II Real-time strategy game. What could be better! The genius of the game is it's frangible/breakable environments and the ability to strategically attack a situation in a variety of ways. Are you gonna take out that entrenched 88 with an infantry attack? Attack it head-to-head with a tank? Try to flank it with multiple tanks? Try an air strike? Drop behind it with a paratrooper? Or just run it over with a lightning tank manuever? Time can be slowed down, paused or sped up. Single-player campaigns are historic and fun. Keep in mind that the game is difficult and frustrating at the best of times - but each play-through creates all kinds of random options. Animations, sounds and explosions are top-notch. Micro-management is highly detailed. My favorite modern RTS!			",164,46,9,25,12,2,52

												An innovative Second World War real-time tactics game. Don't let the setting put you off, it refreshingly depicts many unexplored theatres of war such as North Africa and the Eastern Front. Battles such as the valiant defense of Sevastopol and the German airborne invasion of Crete are also covered. Its unique ""direct control"" feature and  vast arsenal of authentic WWII weaponry distinguishes it from the glut of others strategy games. I urge anyone  to check it out to convince you of its merits.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												COOP, strategy, hardmode 10.000. Get a friend buy the game play and die. Have lots of fun. Possibly the best game about WWII, unless you want your games simplistic and easy, in which case you should settle for WII games. Like Soldiers, Men of War will be the best game no-one will buy. I hope I am wrong.			",165,11,0,17,12,2,34

												Compared to other RTS games, Men of War is one of the most realistic games out there. I myself am a fan of realism and I especially like what the devs were trying to achieve. I find the game to be rather tedious though and the campaign I find to be frustratingly difficult, maybe I just suck? I dunno, maybe this game isn't for me. This is a very good game though and anyone who wants to try a similuation like game instead of an arcade style game then good ahead and get this game.Cheers ",10,0,0,0,4,0,11

												I'm reltively new to the steam community/gaming here and I have to say, I enjoy every second. PC games are the best around. There is so much more you can do, there is almost no limit. I have always enjoyed stratgey games but never could grasp the concept when I was younger. Now that I am a little more seasoned, I enjoy computer games much more now. If you are looking for a real RTS game with challenges, playablity, and just the shear gaming experience I highly recommend this game, you will not regret it. Espcially for this price.

												If you enjoy 1C games, RTS, or just WWII in general, the whole Faces/Men of War franchise is worth a look. Having something like 300 hours alone on my disc-copy of Faces of War, Men of War was a great change. That said however, the franchise suffers in multiplayer. I'm not 100% sure about AS or AS2, but Men of War does not have localized servers that I have found (prior to Nov. 2014 when Gamefly offically shut down the multiplayer) which is a bit problematic given the large european audience that plays the game. Still, the single player is a good 10 hours worth, and the multiplayer (if ever picked up) is also enjoyable, provided RNGesus finds you a match relatively close by.			",76,1,0,7,3,0,6

												Buy this game if you're looking for a good PVP experience with friends. Don't expect to find anyone in the lobby waiting to play though, so don't count on that. Also don't expect anything from this game single player, the voice acting, setup and general design of the campaign is a joke. If you're really interested in the great mechanics that make this RTS worth playing but don't have friends to play it with, consider buying Men of War: Vietnam. Still not a good campaign, but better.			",32,7,1,22,5,0,22

												SPOILER ALERT!!! THIS REVIEW IS A SPOILER!!! DO NOT READ!!!During Part 1 of the Battle of Seelow Heights, I was tasked to sneak four Soviet commandos past German lines. It was night. The anti-day. Being seen would kill my men. I crawled one of my commandos close to the Nazis and tried sneaking him across their lines. He died. I reloaded a save file and I tried it again, and he died; I reloaded.I then tried sneaking across two at a time. They died. Reloaded. I then crawled all of them across simultaneously and reloaded. Then I tried sending them across: one-by-one. And the first made it. Then the second made it. Then the third was found and they died. I then tried sniping some Nazis from afar, saving now and then, adding Nazi deaths. And with weakened enemy lines, I sneaked my guys into a bush, on the other side. Two Germans walked into that bush. Reloaded.After two hours of reloading saves later, I got them past the enemy lines. And three hours after that, I de-mined a canyon, planted my own mines, planted some TNT, and moved my Ground Hog Day commandos to the Part 2 checkpoint.Dawn. The Anti-Dusk.The game tells me we have to take the German positions on the hills, and it tells me I have a limited number of computer-controlled reinforcements, whose bodies are essential to victory. And the battle is a slog. The Germans are dug-in. I see the number of reinforcements ticking down. I see that I will run out of friends long before the main base is captured. So I reload. Many times. Four hours later, I give up on reloading and on playing the game on “Normal.” But I don’t lower the difficulty. I just wait for the number of reinforcements to tick down. And it does…. They keep coming; allied troops keep coming; an hour later they keep coming; the end of the battle they keep coming.....7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my all time favorite strategy games.First, THE BAD:The Voice Acting - Id rather be listening to Nickelback.Learning curve - Second mission puts you in control of over 50 men. It's not noob friendly. This is a drawback for some but it's rewarding succeed in this game.Minor Gliches - Nothing game breaking but it's no StarCraft 2.Here's The Good:Direct control - allows you to take control of a specific unit (anything from a tank to a sniper).Realistic Tank Combat system - Seriously... it's amazing. The shot penetration depends on the angle, armor thickness, round size, and distance. This makes for some awesome in game moments where you can take out multiple Panzer III with a single KV-1.Old School Inventory system - This is a downside for some but I love having to drop ammo into each soldier, loading up tanks by dragging Shells from one unit to the other. It would be nice it there was a more steamlined way of doing this but being able to salvage higher teir weapons with extra riflemen can make all the difference in a mission.Dynamic Destruction - Huge explosions as well as craters and fully distructable buildings. What more do you need?Mission Veriaty - From huge frontline assults to night raids, this game has something for all.Don't take my word for it, try out the demo.			",76,7,4,8,25,0,21

												With only 12 hours of gameplay I am addicted to this game. Its a  fast paced RTS that makes you think on the fly. I like fact that the singleplayer is tough, I feel like a lot of games are too easy or too hard. Like any game there are downsides like its MASSIVE learning curve! The tutorial is literly keep guys in cover to avoid their deaths, throw gernades at vehicles to blow them up and select your guys. The rest you have to learn as you go. To me it was hard to pick up for the first hour but afterwards it only got better. One thing you have to know about this game is one mistake will throw the mission for you. Sometimes that one extra soldier can make or break the firefight which can lead to a very bad sceniro where you lose  your tank, 6 men,  and left with only 2 guys to complete the mission. Be prepared to lose a few times on easy.			",54,2,0,6,17,0,21

												Just shooting enemies is the Missionary Position of Men of War. It gets the job done and its fun but there are about a hundred different ways to go at it.For example... How to kill a guard on a smoke break - Run him over in a vehicleStabDisarm enemy AP mine, rearm and place it then lure he and his squad over itCrush with environmental debris from explosions or with the burnt out husk of a destroyed enemy vehicle that you push like a bulldozer over him.Guns & GrenadesBare handedThrowing knife while hidden prone in tall grassAir Support & Artillary of several different varieties if availableAnd you may be thinking... ok yeah so what?. Well, the point is that this game offers all of that OR you can zoom out until infantry are the size of ants and control a column of tanks and armored vehicles in real time... then slow down time and zoom in to the drivers seat of one of your jeeps and make the driver get out and man a machine gun nest whose previous occupant was killed AND if you really think it through you can make that driver pull his jeep up to provide soft cover from one side to protect him from being flanked. Once defending against a wave of german armor I barely survived until reinforcements came, when they did I was allowed to call in heavy tanks and I did... when I took them to chase the germans accross a frozen river one of my largest tanks cracked the ice and fell in - then I realized I could break the ice to prevent their lighter armor from crossing.I was instructed to take a fortified position with a wave of infantry.I broke from the main group to comandeer a truck so I could hopefully pick up enough speed to make it over the trenches and then ram into the machine gunners sandbags with hopefully enough force to dislodge or kill him (this in itself says a lot as this isn't a canned animation or a suggested tactic, or a button - it's just something you figure out because the game apparently has a fairly robust implementation of object physics; destroyed vehicles sometimes explode and sometimes dont depending on what happened to them but if they do explode the pieces land wherever the force of the explosion takes them and then can be used as cover).

This has something of a story to follow however the sequels (Assault Squad and AS 2) are just repetitive capture the flag and hold it missions over and over with new maps. This is a good game as it has:Story LineNon-repetitive MissionsSmart AIFun Missiosn (That require you to think not just send all your troops in a suicide charge to the enemy lines like in AS 1&2)Missions are broken up into little sections that are fun to play as.AI is for the most part unpredictable and can smash through your lines easy.I (as a history buff) love this game, it may not be realistic and the physics may be the worst (A car can break down a concrete wall?)

												So far, I haven't played the game much, but it's already really great. I played Men Of War: Assault Squad first, and honestly this game seems a little more varied so far. The game begins a little slow, but then it winds up with, I think, a little more unit variety and objectives than the later ""campaigns"", for MOWAS, which really boil down to the same mission over and over with a new map, and sometimes units, each time. Overall, it's really fun, and, in my opinion, has a bit more to keep interest, especially for offline. ",117,12,0,1,13,0,20

												Strategy game where you need to think in time to time instead of spamming endless forces towards enemy. There is so much depth in this game compared to another rts-games, which makes this stand above others. For example every soldier has its own inventory, every vehicle has fuel, ammo and inventories also. You can repair, refuel and rearm stuff between intensive firefights. Best played with cooperative mode with your friends.			",117,23,5,11,10,0,27

												A neat little game made for folks who enjoy micromanagement, and like bit more realistic stuffs. You can group your soldiers into groups, but can direct them independently of course. Ah, and all of them have their own inventories with ammo, weapons, grenades, and so forth. So, your average Joe can hold an SMG, an LMG, a rifle, and buttloads of grenades. Okay, it might not be entirely historically accurate, but gives the game some enjoyable moments as you can pick soldiers that will be assigned to special tasks as you take direct control of them - yep, this game has direct control. Press End, and your dreams can come true. It doesn't really work when you have multiple platoons to take care of, but on missions where you have just a small group of soldiers at your disposal, it's awesome. Also, direct controlled tanks are awesome - take aim, and disable enemy tanks' turrets. Enemy soldiers will leave the vehicle, and your MGs can easily take care of them. And then...Grand Theft Wehrmacht happens. Hop in with a single soldier, drive the tank back behind your lines, repair it, put some additional bods into it, and bam, you have a fully functional tank to crush your enemies and see them driven before you. Also, it saves reinforcements - if you are lucky and have some skills, you can finish maps without losing your own tanks and using only looted enemy vehicles. And, it's challenging. Even on Normal you'll have some hard times, if you are not too much into micromanagement, and you aren't a really freakin hardcore strategist. But if you learn the basics, you'll have really good times with this game, and feel growing desire to get each and every one of them. Sadly it lacks proper skirmish where you get a map and battle the AI, but there are enough missions to counter this. Sadly this game was supported by GameSpy, and I'm not sure if you can get it working with Hamachi, but it's worth a try if you and your friends are looking for some WW2 carnage. Especially recommended for wargamers.			",374,65,25,69,40,5,112

												!NOTE: I BOUGHT THIS GAME ON MY OLD ACCOUNT WITH ALL MISSIONS FINISHED HENCE THE LOW AMMOUNT OF HOURS!This game is by far the best in the series so far. This has something of a story to follow however the sequels (Assault Squad and AS 2) are just repetitive capture the flag and hold it missions over and over with new maps. This is a good game as it has:Story LineNon-repetitive MissionsSmart AIFun Missiosn (That require you to think not just send all your troops in a suicide charge to the enemy lines like in AS 1&2)Missions are broken up into little sections that are fun to play as.AI is for the most part unpredictable and can smash through your lines easy.I (as a history buff) love this game, it may not be realistic and the physics may be the worst (A car can break down a concrete wall?)

												If you enjoy 1C games, RTS, or just WWII in general, the whole Faces/Men of War franchise is worth a look. Having something like 300 hours alone on my disc-copy of Faces of War, Men of War was a great change. That said however, the franchise suffers in multiplayer. I'm not 100% sure about AS or AS2, but Men of War does not have localized servers that I have found (prior to Nov. 2014 when Gamefly offically shut down the multiplayer) which is a bit problematic given the large european audience that plays the game. Still, the single player is a good 10 hours worth, and the multiplayer (if ever picked up) is also enjoyable, provided RNGesus finds you a match relatively close by.			",76,1,0,7,3,0,6

												Compared to other RTS games, Men of War is one of the most realistic games out there. I myself am a fan of realism and I especially like what the devs were trying to achieve. I find the game to be rather tedious though and the campaign I find to be frustratingly difficult, maybe I just suck? I dunno, maybe this game isn't for me. This is a very good game though and anyone who wants to try a similuation like game instead of an arcade style game then good ahead and get this game.Cheers ",10,0,0,0,4,0,11

												Interesting game ALOT of micromanaging all because the soldiers are either running right next to a tank to hit it with an AT bomb, or maybe an Anti-Tank gun is trying go through a building, and sometimes soldiers just decide sitting right next to a grenade is a good idea. But direct control can fix some of your issues and the only problem is you can only direct so much time into getting a AT gun out of a building without the enemy getting a tank through your defence. Later when I found out soldiers had seperate invertories great... well it was at first very time consuming to refill ammo because you had to give every soldier a portion of ammo but then I figured out that sqaud leaders will  share ammo with their squad which made it  alot less of a pain when they run out of ammo to restock. Overall it is a great game my only problems are on stealth missions they seem way to hard as the enemy seems to always find me but other than that no problems.Rating: 9/10			",140,14,1,9,15,1,28

												The Men of War games are like Company of Heroes' weird cousin. They put more emphasis on depth and realism, but are also less polished. At one moment you'll be frantically defending against a massive enemy assault while armor-piercing shells ricochet from your realistically modelled tank armor, at another moment you'll assume direct control of a soldier and go on a wild machine-gun rampage.This particular game features a long and challenging single-player campaign, which is highly enjoyable if you can endure the worst voice-acting in video game history (No seriously, it's that bad). If you want to play multiplayer or co-op, you're better off playing the sequel, Men of War: Assault Squad.Overall, I would highly recommend this if you're into WW2 strategy games.
