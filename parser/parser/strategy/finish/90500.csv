												Some interesting concepts here but it doesn't come together for a fun experience.  The campaign is very short, the card mechanics are too reliant on sacrificing cards to boost your creatures, no deck building and the scenarios are always stacked against you.  That second item (saccing cards) really ruined the game for me.  I have no problem with playing cards to give you bonuses but what you are doing here is not casting a spell.  You just discard it and your creature gets a bonus.  Many, many battles are won by who can sacrifice the most.  Not fun at all.  With some tweaking this could have been a good game but it falls short.  You are better off spending your time and money elsewhere in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This looked fun on paper, so I rolled the dice on this game... and started regretting it about an hour after. Each stage in this game drags out for what it seems like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ eternity, models and animations are plain ugly, the outcome of battles is overly dependant on the luck of the draw and thus AI tends to gain unfair advantage here and there, all resulting in a really frustrating and daunting gameplay. Zero strategy, no deck builder, not fun. No multiplayer, no replay value, no involvement with the story either (was there even one? I cannot remember).I suppose you could buy it when it's on sale if you're crazy about card games like me. I really like the concept but this game simply fails at too many aspects to be worth its current price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know why all the hate and downvote for this game. Its one of the first game I bought on Steam and its really great! I love TCGs and Guardian of Graxia is no exception. I even bought the ""real life"" board game version. Its a hell lot of fun. People seem to complain the AI is OP but honestly, you just gotta learn the game. Its not difficult, learn to position your units by making them walk over as many tiles as possible so you gain a maximum amount of mana each turn. As for card discard, this is tactic. Send weak units first to make AI discard cards (your unit will die but who cares), then send the unit you want to become strong and discard lot of card. I used to play this game all the time and now im starting to play it again			",67,24,0,19,7,1,15

												This game feels overly complicated. While that alone isn't bad, the player is often left in the dark or cannot comprehend how certain actions and numbers are calculated. Everything feels like pure chance way too often. And I haven't found any ingame help or manual that explains the underlying structure of the number crunching. You just cannot play a strategy ""card"" game, if you do not have the means to successfully develop a strategy with the things you are given.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Genre - Strategy Fantasy turn based card game.This game looks exactly like a game I would like. Unfortunately it dissapoints for two major reasons:1) The game plays too slow Zzzzzzzzzz2) The AI seems over powered on most levels HELP!With a bit more play testing and balance this game could have been fun as there are some interesting concepts included that were fairly original at the time. Instead it just feels like an un-rewarding chore. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guardians of Graxia is an innovative strategy card game that offers a detailed tactical challenge on a battle map, combined with the random element of card draws. The strategy is quite deep and not immediately obvious. You can't expect to jump in and play it well without first learning how the game works. Once you understand the mechanics though, it's easy enough to play, but not so easy to win! This is a hard game, which might put some people off, but for those that love a hard challenge, it can be very rewarding.I must admit, when I read the other reviews, I was shocked to see so many negative comments, which is why I felt compelled to add this review of my own. Looking at those reviews, I noticed that many of them were by people who haven't put many hours into the game. Since it takes quite a while to master, I suspect that a lot of the negativity came from not playing it long enough to figure out the best strategies.I'd like to address some of the points made in other reviews:Overly complicated - Yes, it seems that way at first, there is a bit of a learning curve involved, but it's not that hard once you get used to it. The in-game help tells you all you need to know, you just need to take the trouble to read it. As for ""ridiculously complicated"" units with many different abilities, that's a good thing. It creates a lot of variety in the game, making the strategy more complex and interesting.Trouble Man said that the game doesn't explain the number crunching, but it does. When in battle, there's a small arrow underneath Projected Health. Click this and it shows you the Damage Calculations. All the modifiers are listed to help you understand exactly what's going on in the battle.Luck not Strategy - Not true! Sure, there's a lot of luck in which cards you draw, but hey, it's a card game, that's kind of the whole point! But once you've drawn your cards, what you do with them is pure strategy. There's nothing random in the combat calculations, it depends entirely on which cards are played. Of course, you don't know what cards the computer will play during the battles, but that's not luck, it's making strategic choices based on the cards it has available.Just as the computer can ruin your attack by playing a powerful card, you can do exactly the same if you have one. Choosing which cards to play and which to save until later is a big part of the strategy. Tip: make feint attacks with unimportant units to force the computer to waste valuable cards, then make your important attacks with your best cards later, once the computer is out of good cards to defend with.Another important aspect of the strategy are terrain effects and unit special abilities. Place units on tiles they gain an advantage on, not on ones that give them a disadvantage. Surround enemy units to gain support advantages. Capture many tiles quickly to increase your mana generation. There's loads of strategic possibilities on the battlefield.Hard AI, scenarios stacked against you - This is true. It's not an easy game, but if it were then it wouldn't be much of a challenge. It's a pity there aren't more easy scenarios or different difficulty levels to make it easier for new players, but that's just the way it is. It may seem daunting at first, but it gets easier once you figure out the best strategies. People often criticise the AI for being too easy in many games, so it makes a nice change that this AI offers a hard challenge. If that scares you, then don't buy it, but if you love a hard strategical challenge, this may be for you.Turn limits - Some people don't like this, but again, it's all part of the challenge. If you had unlimited turns it would make the game too easy. You'd just grab most of the tiles, get most of the mana and simply out-produce the AI. Besides, many people complain about the slow turns, so do you really want the game to go on for even longer?Slow Turns - True, this can be annoying. I wish there were a way of speeding them up. But it's not the end of the world. You can always watch TV or do something else while the AI is taking its turn, or check your Facebook page, or whatever...Story? What story? This is a strategy game! Who cares about story! :-)Some reviewers compared the game to Magic the Gathering. Why? Because it's a fantasy game and it has cards? As I see it, this game is nothing like MtG, the game mechanics are completely different. IMO, this is more of a turn based strategy game than a card game. If MtG is what you are expecting, think again.Saint Killjoy said ""don't ignore the bad reviews, they were given for a reason"" - That sounds fair enough, but I suspect that the two main reasons for the bad reviews are:1. Having the wrong expectations about the game - perhaps thinking it will be like MtG, or thinking it will be easy because it's a card game. Don't buy it based on what you think or hope it will be like, buy it based on what it is. Check out some YouTube videos first.2. Not playing it for long enough to figure out the best strategies. Yes it's hard, but you shouldn't give up too easily or pass judgement too soon. Good strategy games often take a long time to master.My advice would be this: Make up your own mind about this game based on the kind of games that YOU like to play, not on the opinions of others who often have different tastes in games.I'm not saying that everyone should like and buy this game. I'm sure that there are many people who would hate it. But for those that enjoy challenging turn based strategy against a hard AI, with some card based randomness thrown in, I highly recommend it. Just be sure that you know what you're letting yourself in for.For the current sale price, it's a no brainer IMO. And even if you don't like it, you won't have lost much. But if you do buy it, make sure to buy both DLCs as well. There are only 9 maps in the base game. The DLCs add another 16 maps (some of which generate random terrain) and two more guardians, providing a lot more replayability.To sum up:PROS:Challenging and deep turn based strategy.Huge variety of special abilities.Card based randomness ensures that every game is different.Battles are quite hard.CONS:Gameplay seems a bit complex at first.It takes a while to figure out the best strategies.Slow AI turns.Battles are quite hard.

												Play this game if you want to go up against hard to impossible odds in single player and prefer luck over strategy to get wins in multiplayer.  Nothing quite like setting up a big attack only to find out that your opponent god-drawed a card to disable all support effects, or crippling the opposing hero and getting to watch as he gets healed four times in a single turn.

												Pros: Good concept, decent presentation for what it is, short campaign means I'm done quicker.Cons: Gameplay is slow, AI takes forever to do anything, campaign missions have arbritrary events that will ruin your battle plan without any warning that only get worse as the campaign progresses, CCG elements are shallow with no customization or even a card viewer, tactics elements are shallow with low variety and boring grindy levels, the in game UI is almost good but gets frustrating at times as you fight with popups that get in the way of what you're trying to do, the story is forgettable and told via pop up text boxes with no other in game elements.If you like the concepts of this game (CCG meets tactics with hero unit/avatar) then I'd recommend Mage Wars (Board game from Arcane Wonders) instead. There's a link on the Subreddit to the official forums with a way to play it online even if that's more what you're looking for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I hate being forced to do some objective at a certain speed. Sometimes is almost impossible to make the mission in time.-Slooooooow gameplay. Terribly slow, i hate the game being so damn slow.-Some bugs. I remember a mission when the AI get stuck because I blocked the teleports (to avoid being chased by enemies).

												this game is honestly kinda interesting, units do some variety of spells and stuff, its fun to play, but honestly it has way too many flaws, in a card game u cant build ur own deck, the game like many other ppl said is way too hard, the AI always has tons of op cards spreaded around the map etc, ive passed 4 of the 5 campaign missions, the last one ive tried 3 times and gave up after the game bugged for 2 times on a random turn. Tried on a normal skirmish map to see if it was any different, 1st map i play game bugs again when i attacked 1 guy...Also the lack in cards is bad and it gets too repetitive after a while especially cuz the learning curve of this game is not soft and always gets way more complicated than normal form mission to mission, i honestly cant recommend this game, sorry.

												Actually quite a good game of strategy. The expansion put in a random map and play so everything is different every game. One does figure out the strategy pretty quickly if one is an experience strategist and the ai becomes easy to beat but the difference in this one is playing and beating the ai. The are is nice and the animations are very good. I don't HIGHLY recommend this game but I do recommend it if you like card strategy games. It's one of a kind and quite different from others even Etherlords. It's more fun than a MTG game with just cards. If only the devs had finished this and made it multiplayer. It would have been a fantastic multiplayer game. As the ai gets pretty predictable an easily exploited once you figure it out. For this price though it's worth finding out. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Beginning the gameI've been playing for a couple of hours and I really have no clue what is going on. I get the basic mechanics but the details are not available in an explanation anywhere, such as what does a portal do and how do I use it?I've done my years playing trading card games and I get they can be very complicated. So big fail on getting the player up to speed on the details of the mechanics, but I don't mind learning by experimenting if I have to, if the reward is a fun game. Then drops the other shoeThe problem with experimenting to learn the mechanics is that the game moves so slow for every little thing. Then, the UI works, but interacting with it is painful. Like if you click the wrong card, does ESC back you out or right click? Because one works in one situation and doesn't in another.  Overall it just becomes frustrating.Then I get to the 2nd scenario and the huge giant just pummels my guys from afar with boulders (8 wounds jeeze) and 2 of the units they gave me, at the opposite end of the board no less, are dead within the first 2 turns. I still don’t know how to use portals, and it seems it would be useful here but it doesn’t work.This is when I realize:1) After 2 rounds and 2 hours, I don't know how to play this game well enough to compete even with a bad AI.2) Trying to fight with bad UI, lack of any kind of decent instructions and the punishingly slow game progress is simply a waste of my time.3) This game was probably a waste of money.I say probably, because the strategic board game/TCG hybrid is interesting to me and is in my niche. It is conceivable that if I knew how to play it, I could get past all the bad (though the bad is terrible), and get some of my money's worth out of the game. I hated Blood Bowl when I first played but, after watching some experts play through it, I got it and I ended up enjoying the game. Maybe this game could be that, but there is no such walkthrough to watch, no wiki to read, nothing. Skip this game or trade it instead of activating it on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, meh, but I guess I'll give this an upvote. The graphics are very nice, I like the setup and it could have been so much more had it (as with many games) had some love and ownership attention instead of the typical abandoment. I have not had any of the tech problems I see mentioned (I'm an AMD, Radeon, win 10 gamer). Have had zerop crashes, and the the expansion works fine, had no problems or bugs in the time i've played it. My only complaint is at this early stage I do not see any ""endless"" skirmish mission. The longest being some ""kill 15 units"" mission. Perhaps more searching will reveal a longer lasting one. The skirmish missions are tyoo short, with a great many of them having turn limits and other ""limit"" consieration that really kills it. It's this game's only fatal flaw IMO. Workshop would have been great as this game does have nice potential and I have had quite a bit of fun learning (It does have a learning curve) and playing it. Certianly worth it on sale considering I have had no bugs or issues at all, which, due to some of the reviews, gave me pause. So far i've found none. Recommended 6-7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like good old fashioned board game strategy (and don't mind sussing out how to play without in-depth tutorials to help you) you'll enjoy it, if you want a quick action-fix game you can jump straight into and win you probably won't. Maybe more appealing to the older gamers from the generation that played this type of game out of a box rather than the young 'uns.Some bad reviews have been posted about this game criticising it's lack of deck building and difficulty. This is a bit unfair as it's not a deck building game it's a board game. It may not be perfect and, to be honest, it is quite difficult to get the hang of it and win but that's not to say it's a bad game though especially for the £1.50 sale price. Gameplay does feel agonisingly slow if you haven't got a good deal of patience and maps can take a while to get through. The odds always seem to favour the other side with their seemingly huge mana pools but once you figure out how to play it I found there was fun to be had there and actualy enjoy it. A lack of tutorials is one cause for complaint but if you take the time to look at the unit cards, terrain bonus stats/penalty modifiers and battle stats it soon makes more sense. Almost (if not) all the icons can be moused over to get a description of what they mean. Adjacent units give you a support bonus, mana is generated by the squares you control (some generate more than others) and this pays for your spells and units. Difficulty arises because mana is generated at the end of your turn and if you blow it all countering battles in your opponents turn you have none left for your own fights or to activate some unit's special abilities. Sometimes it's worth taking a bit of pain so you've got the resources to dish it out on your turn.The biggest missed opportunity is the lack of multiplayer. This game is crying out for a head to head mode which would've made it a more balanced and fun experience as well as adding to it's replay value.All in all it may be an aquired taste appealing to a certain type of gamer but it's not as bad as a lot of the negative reviews would have you believe.

												This is a unnecessarilly confusing game. The player takes cards from their deck, plays them onto a 3-D map and uses other cards in hand to cast spells etc. Combat is resolved using melee, ranged and spell attacks, where unwanted cards can be sacrificed for power. The two phases of play that constitute one turn is hard for a n00b to get their head around since the tutorial is rubbish. At the end of the day, the game is just not that much fun to play (for me at least). There is only 5 campaign missions and a few skirmish maps to play. No multiplayer support at all.5/10			",170,26,9,33,58,9,54

												Guardians of Graxia is a fantasy turn based strategy game mixed with a card game. The problem is that they took all the cons of card games and didn't add the pros. It would have been better of as either a full turn based strategy game or card game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What could of been a fun and rewarding strategic card game is wasted on bad game mechanics.First few levels were fun untill I realized that I had to wait and WATCH the computers every single move.And in some of the later stages there are A LOT of npc's ! Think I sat there for 20 minutes waiting to play my turn. There's no option to speed up or skip the computers turn either.Which is dissapointing because this could of been a great game if they would just tweak a few things with the gameplay to speed it up.Skip this turd unless you like to watch paint dry.uninstalled.

												The game has potenial.  I have been gaming for about 20 years +.  This is a strategy card game but feels overly complicated and is very slow game play.  It can kill time and add a mix to your collection, but ill stick with MTG and other cards games. 2/10 (no game is perfect).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't do too many reviews.  But this one has too many negative reviews for me not to chime in.  I really like this game.  I like the challenge and trying again and again with a different tactic.  I beat the game a while ago and was thinking of playing again.  The randomness and the strategy keep me entertained.  I realize this isn't a helpful review lol... but I haven't played it in a couple years.  It's fun if you like a tactical rpg-ish card game.  There's resource management, positioning, and randomness.  Yes, the game can be hard, but it's short too, so you want it to be challenging.  Don't listen to a negative review of someone that played for 15 minutes.			",111,19,3,35,21,3,53

												I got this game off of a bundle. While I'm not a card based game fan, I am a strategy fan. Not having to build my own deck was actually a good thing for me as I'm not into that sort of thing.The campaign is pretty hard getting guardian victories, but it's possible. It took me several hours for each campaign and quite a few hours for the whole campaign. For a completionist like me it was a very stupid thing decided by the designers to make an impossible to complete guardian victory on the last level, and not because of the difficulty, but because of the mechanics.And of course the odds are stacked against you at every pace, this is a strategy game. In every command and conquer game the odds are stacked against you.Overall, I liked the game and I would recommend it. It involves playing your cards right, keeping the important ones and sacrificing the ones that are actually meant to be sacrificed. And even to this day I'm not entirely sure the card drawing is randomized. To me it seemed fixed or at least following a certain pattern, always leaving you room for a win.			",264,63,10,60,43,4,92

												Guardians of Graxia is a strategy card/board game. This sort of game is normally right up my alley, but this game is so poorly designed that it's not worth the time investment, even to fans of the genre. The mechanics are complicated, the cards are ridiculously complex (most cards have 3-6 abilities), and the game doesn't do much to help you along. There may be some strategic depth to the game, but expect to spend way too much time figuring out the basics and becoming familiar with the cards. There's not much more to say; any amount of money spent on it is too much.			",478,189,11,91,53,6,108

												There is a grocery store near me. It is probably one of the few sanctuaries of old fashioned small town American thought left in existence and I mean that as both a positive and a negative. The store hires 70% local kids, makes them all be cleanly shaven, wear suit shirts and has a strict no smoking policy. The store isn't open on sundays, the baggers carry your groceries to your car for you. Visiting the store is like entering a time machine. At the exit to the store is a small gumball machine. For 25 cents you get one gumball. The thing is the machine is broken. It will 9 times out of 10 give you 2 gumballs. I bought this game on an extreme sale for 25 cents. If that gumball machine only ever gave out one gumball instead of 2 I would recomend the game over the gumball machine. As it is I get more long lasting enjoyment out of 2 gumballs than I have out of this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a messier, much more complicated, and fantasy-themed version of the Xbox 360-exclusive Panzer General: Allied Assault game from 2009. Panzer General was clunky, but playable and fun. To its credit, Graxia includes some of the balance improvements from the more refined board game version of Panzer General, but it does EVERYTHING else wrong. There's broken English everywhere. The tutorial is awful. The campaign is a measly SIX missions! There's no more deck building - each leader has his own deck, and you're stuck with it. (Supposedly you can unlock a few bonus cards by meeting special conditions in missions, but stupidly they're secret). The graphics are ugly - hilariously, wisps are just a ball of light. Every unit has several special abilities, so it's almost impossible to keep track of it all, especially because of the weird terms chosen by developers who very clearly aren't native English speakers.

												Before I go into the review, here is some information you'll need as at the time of me playing it before completeing it, the game is broken and requires the following fix, however for some it still doesn't work:Rename CREDITSTEXTFILE_ENGLISH.DAT as CREDITSTEXTFILE_UNITED_KINGDOM.DAT and MASTERTEXTFILE_ENGLISH.DAT as MASTERTEXTFILE_UNITED_KINGDOM.DATBoth of these are in ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\guardians of graxia\DATA\TEXT\The actual game however, it quite fun and I've been waiting for ages to play it as it's a turn-based, card based, tile-based game. It's a lot of fun, however I found as soon as I got to the second mission the difficulty just jumped out of the floor and into the sky. I'd like to see more games like this, but a little more easily balanced. Plus there are only 5 missions in it.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												Complete rubbish, pass. The game has none of the benefits of a collectible card game (namely, constructing a deck), has a very limited number of cards on offer (after playing a few games you will have seen them all), actually has LESS in it than the board game it was derived from (just to prove there is, in fact, a god that hates you), and has the graphical quality of a highschool dev class project. I was really looking forward to something better and the game screen shots fail to convey just how little there is on offer and how painfully slow the game is, even when it has nothing to calculate but passes.I have been utterly wow'd by a game that is worse than its board game basis. Oh and no multiplayer, just in case you needed icing on that♥♥♥♥♥♥cake. Pass. Pass so ♥♥♥♥ing hard on this. Oh and it crashes, often, I know there is a way to fix this but if you release a game this bad and it doesn't even work why should anyone bother? Don't buy it. Seriously.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Overall:Game have nice idea but geeeez AI at easy have 10 times stronger units and more mana with every turn. I will not even talk about spells. For example you have ""+1 health single unit"" spell and enemy have ""1 tile AOE dealing 5dmg"" spell (that leaves your ranks with something around 2health each unit). At SECOND campaign mission enemy also have a dragon. Nothing unusual but he have 15hp 2dmg shield and killing him with your units is really hard (and enemy have 10 other units + summoned ones).Game is waste of time cause i have no idea what im doing there. I really tried because i like games like this but i cant play it cause im falling a sleep and still cant learn how to play this ""thing"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nevertheless it's pretty hard, already from the beginning of the first campaign. So hard that probably only true hearted, strategy empowered fans are going to last all the way through (or people with cheat engine). The enemy has no excessive advantages but it plans a little better than oneself. What might be due to the math-heavy gamemechanics.A very solid title for amateur strategists and board game addicts.6 out of 10 *			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
