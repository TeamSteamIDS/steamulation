Duelyst is a perfect mix between CCG and chess and probably one of the best strategy games I have ever played.You should definitely give it a shot If you like games like Hearthstone, Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, or Advance Wars.It's EXTREMELY F2P-friendly. It turns out to be really rewarding since you get gold for pretty much everything.One good thing about it is that a very basic deck can get you started and boost you to the top of the ladder, as skill plays a bigger role than having good cards.In Duelyst you play on a board where you place creatures. In order to win, you need to kill your opponent's general while keeping yours alive.When playing this game you need to be smart, positioning is very important and it can win or lose you games. There are many ways to outplay your opponent and trust me, it feels darn good.The game lets you choose amongst 6 different Factions (or classes if you come from Hearthstone) which cover every archetype, and each faction has 2 different Generals (or hero powers in HS).It takes 5~10 games to actually understand how the game works, so I would suggest to read a bit about the game to learn the basics.Reddit is a good learning source where you can find some guides. I specially recommend watching the Kibler's and Mogwai's videos that you can find here:Reddit guidesThere are 4 game modes:Practice, where you can unlock the basic cards of each faction and get to know them.Ranked, where you can play against other players. There isn't a casual mode, but it's worth noting that once you reach a new tier (Silver, Gold, Diamond and S-Rank), you can't drop your rank and you get rewards at the end of the season, so it's worth it.Challenges, which are kind of puzzles where you need to defeat the enemy general in one turn. They are very helpful to learn the different mechanics and they give gold. I totally recommend doing them if you are a new player.Gauntlet, or draft mode. Similar to Hearthstone's arena.If you enjoy strategy games Duelyst will most likely hook you for a while. I totally recommend trying it atleast.Besides, the art and the OST is freaking amazing.By the way! If you are a new player maybe you want to use a referral code to get 100 gold for free. You can use it either when signing up, in your friend list or in the settings, BUT YOU NEED TO USE IT BEFORE PLAYING YOUR FIRST RANKED GAME.My referral code is ""drakkenuvz"". I mean, you get 100g and I get a Spirit Orb (card pack) if you reach Silver division. Sounds fair, right?Enjoy the game! "

												~ From someone who just started six hours before it was released on Steam. Read this in full if you need help on deciding whether or not to try this out. If the pixel art (or fear of P2W) is barring you from playing, I noted my experiences with it down below.I've been looking for an addictive game I can spend thousands on hours on for months and this is it. Historically, few games are able to hold my attention (Dota, League, CS:GO, Persona, Disgaea, Warframe, Trove) so this is a compliment of the highest order coming from me. Just for the record, I played 136 games in a span of 24 hours yesterday. If this isn't digital heroin, I don't know what is. Honestly, I've known of this game's existence for a year already. I'm not a diehard fan of card games but I do find that they have an innate quality of addiction so I've always been looking around for one. Hex, Infinity Wars, Spellweaver, Solforge, YGO, MTG, you name it, I've played it. Although there is an exception, I've never played Hearthstone and Faeria so I can't speak on how similar they are, I do suspect it is a vastly different experience though.The funny thing is, I only tried out this game out of desperation. While I'm a fan of Disgaea, Brigandine, Soul Nomad, Makai Kingdoms and other grid-based strategy games, the promotional material of this game led me to believe that the board is far too simplistic to be able to reproduce the same kind of feeling. So imagine my surprise. It doesn't quite play out like any of the aforementioned games but it is far from being dumbed down or otherwise. My first hour of playing against real people in this game, I instantly noticed how much thought was put into the design of this game. This ain't no joke, the effects, the balance are all really good. I got stomped multiple times for thinking I could just summon my monsters and rush straight to the other guy. No sir, it doesn't work like that.  Then there's the other reason, the art. The character portraits and the UI are modern and vivid. It oozes style, yet the in-game sprites are 8-bit-esque and really, really low resolution. That bothered me to no end and is the other core reason I forgoed trying this out initially. While the sprites are really, really done well, I'm not going to delude the both of us (if you're not a fan of low-res sprites as well) and say that I love it. I'm still not partial to it and it bothers me whenever I look at it but my dislike soon faded into the background as I clocked more and more hours in. A couple of dozens in, I barely notice it anymore. I still wish they went into full res sprites a la Disgaea's recent years, but for what we're given, it's more than good enough. Now, is the game P2W? As other reviews have noted, the  game is really, really generous to players without cash. Probably the most generous out of any card game out there. Furthermore, I've gone on really, really bad lose steaks but my losses were never about my opponent having better cards, it was about my own mistakes. Too many a time I was about to win a game but made one little mistake and lost. The basic and common cards are far from weak, you could hold your own all the way to Rank 10 (you start at 30) or even higher without even spending your in-game gold on a single booster. Even then, Duelyst allows you to craft cards for your ideal deck by disenchanting cards you have, so with a little bit of grind, you'll have it in no time.Those are my thoughts, of course, your mileage will inevitably vary but if what's holding you back from at the very least, trying out the game is the pixel art, fear of p2w or the simplistic looking gameplay, I can tell you without a doubt that you should try a few ladder games (or gauntlet games) before calling your judgement. If I helped you in taking the plunge in trying this game out, do use my referral code if you're feeling generous. You get 100 Gold and I get a pack and gold as you progress through the ladder. Referral Code is ""cairus"" which is the same as my in-game name. If you're going to use a referral code, remember to manually enter it under your account settings -> redeem referral because the other ways of claiming it are buggy at the moment. Add me if you ever try it out and we can maybe play some games or something. Also, play a game against a friend when go in (regardless of whether or not you used a referral code) to get a free booster pack. Should hang out in the Duelyst Discord Channel as well, they helped me a lot.			"

												I'm not a veteran CCG, strategy game or even a Duelyst player. I am however actively playing it for the past few months now and feel comfortable saying how I pretty much experienced all there is to it. And despite me usually not liking games of this sort, it still managed to get my attention. Here are some reasons why:- easy to learn, hard to master- new player friendly- game actively rewards you for playing- variety of competitive decks- low amounts of RNG- cards with higher rarity aren't necessarily better- high quality artwork and animations- devs communicate with players on almost daily basisNot to say the game is without its flaws though:- currently there is no casual game mode- some people will dislike the pixel art- certain interactions between mechanics aren't clear- UI could use some work- can feel grindy at timesAll in all, it's a very solid game with a team of passionate devs and community behind it. It's not particularly innovative, but it takes mechanics from various games and puts them together in a way that produces something amazing, familiar and yet different enough to have it's own identity.

												Duelyst is a fresh mix of Tactics-style games like the Final Fantasy Tactics Series or Fire Emblem and Collectible Card Games like Hearthstone. This game draws you in with its cunning finesse, gorgeous art style and fair game design.The free to play model works very well; you pay mostly for either cosmetics or to get cards quicker. There are daily quests which will keep you playing and currently there is an event where you can get a free Legendary skin and emotes. The developers are extending the game regurarly and communicate often with the fan base.All in all it's a highly fun and enjoyable game. I encourage you to check it out.			"

												(Don't let my hours on Steam fool you, I've been playing this game for months now.)Duelyst is a turn-based tactical CCG, with clearer inspiration from Hearthstone and board games rather than Magic: The Gathering. The true draw lies not only in the CCG gameplay and card collecting, but in the tactical board and movement system.The cards, factions and most of the mechanics are pretty standard for a digital CCG these days, but there's a good amount of mechanics which only work on the board setting. There's not much else I can say about the facts without parroting the store page, so I'll move onto my opinions now:The Good+Two patches per month, one for bugs and balance, and one for new cards.+Regular community communication. (Reddit, Forums and hopefully soon Steam.)+Reasonably quick balacing of problem cards.+Gameplay that makes you think at all times. Positioning and movement is extremely important.+More conistsent card draw and hand manipulation, making the game less about lucky draws and more about inevitability.+Counterplay throws free gold at you every day. It's not unrealistic to be able to buy a pack per day with just gold.+As a result, it's very easy to build up a card collection, a lot of Spirit (used to craft cards, like Hearthstone) and make a competitive deck.The Bad-Highly competitive ladder full of veteran CCG players. (Not great for newbies.)-While the business model for cards is good, the business model for cosmetics seems unreasonable. Emotes (small static images) shouldn't cost several dollars.-No card trading (like Hearthstone.)-Some frustrating (perhaps broken) mechanics that can make games frustrating, and make wins feel undeserved at times.-Cosmetic features that only exist because Hearthstone does them, and are very poorly executed, to the point of distraction/annoyance.-Due to recent events, I'll have to say that the devs have done a few things I can't agree with, such as lowering the amoutn of gold you get from a certain quest and then not adding it to the patch notes. Be catious in the future.Overall I'd say the game is great, and with every patch it just gets better. Recently they've improved cosmetic aquisition slightly and at the end of August they're releasing an expansion which comes packaged with a bunch of balance changes, as well as some truly unique new mechanics. You don't need to wait for the steam release to play this game, you can go to Counterplay's website and download the standalone client yourself if you're impatient.			"

 Target Audience:   Anyone who likes Strategy.  Hours listed inaccurate, as I having played the game outside of Steam.  Note: Due to the stupidity of the reviewer and him making the review video a while ago, he got confused and indicated that he played a mobile version of the game. There is no mobile version of the game. It's upcoming. He's stupid. Summary:  Look, it's not Hearthstone, but when I say it's a Hearthstone Rival, I mean it's the kind of game that has the visual appeal and in-depth strategy that will draw people in, and want them to play match over and over again. And in all honestly, I prefer it over Hearthstone: as new players can easily be competitive against other players, and there's really a lot of strong strategies that can be created, even within a specific hero type. Strategy is actually key here, and playing to your heroes strengths is important, but being willing to go outside his comfort zone can give you a needed edge in battle. There's a lot to learn here, but some good challenge and tutorials help this out. And unlike other F2P games, I never felt that I was at a significant disadvantage if I didn't go and pay for cards. Granted, there are some powerful cards, but the synergy with some of the base cards you get can overshadow them, to the point where it really does feel like your skill with the game overcomes everything else. Look, it's free 2 play, and it's one of the best strategy games of its type, so there's absolutely no reason not to try it. Just be aware that you may get addicted to it. Video Review:

			Duelyst may have the power to replace Hearthstone if given the proper chance. I've said before that I think Hearthstone isn't that good, and I've been waiting for some good strategy CCG that could...		

 Lists: Positives: Strategy is placed over everything else: focusing on the chess match between the two players, and not necessarily whose got the best cards. Great cards are good, but they mean nothing if you can't really use them in combination with others. Lots of depth. Can really play around with different strategies, and the game takes a while to exhaust you.  Online play never gave me problems. Quick to find a match, quick to play, and the times to wait/strategize seem right on.  Knowing your opponent is rather important. Knowing what they could pull out so you could deal with them, and rewarded predicting what an oppponent could pull. .  All the different heroes have different archtypes that really play to different strengths, and make them feel very unique in the long run.  Definitely not a pay to win scenario here. Never felt any need to grab more cards because well, it feels like balance. Factions are well balanced.  Replace feature is nice to keep things fresh on the strategy element. Makes things a lot more dynamic.   Great designs.  Strong visual pixel aesthetic that has fluid animations, and makes the characters come to life. Unlike other pixel games, this one feels appropriate.Negatives: Provoke seems overpowered to me, even when I take a step back after the video was created. I think its just too useful in the long run. There's a LOT to learn. A lot.  Gold earning could be a tiny bit easier in the early game.  Honestly, it's a game that's just going to be better on mobile. Not because the PC implementation is bad or  anything, it's just nicer to pick up a game where ever you want to. It's that kind of game. UI does have too much open space. It's addictive. I know that may not seem like a negative, but this is to warn people that yes, you can get lost playing this game, and if you want to avoid that, well, avoid the game. "

												Pros:1. The board element of the game creates tactically significant choices, because good players can play around cards depending on the correct positioning of minions and their general, and bad players can play into cards through bad positioning.2. The replace mechanic (you can put one card from your hand back into your deck and draw another card each turn) rewards players who know the cards in their deck and what the curve of their deck is most likely to draw. So, a good player can know how likely it is to draw an answer to a problematic situation on the board and make the optimal play accordingly.3. There is a diverse amount of similar power level cards (for their mana cost) that results in greater deck variety than other CCGs, and Counterplay has stated their goal (in a podcast) is to make the gap between the power level of cards as narrow as possible, so this trend is likely to continue.4. The game has challenges that act as tutorials for learning the mechanics of the game; I think these are very helpful for new players, and the challenges give new players gold. 5. Games are saved as replays in the match history, which lets players go over their turns and analyze their mistakes. Also, your friends can view your replays in order to give you advice on what to improve, or just enjoy a funny game that you played.6. Similar to your own replays, you can watch replays of ladder matches from the various divisions (bronze, silver, gold, diamond, and S-rank) in order to learn from other players, and streamers that are pillars of the community -- most of the time -- show up in that section: ""Watch.""7. This game is not pay-to-win because I have seen many, many free-to-play players make it to S-rank (the highest league in Duelyst). Pick your favorite faction and play.Cons:1. The pixel art style is disliked by some, and some parts of the UI doesn't fit into the pixel art style. The most recent example of this is the screen where spirit orbs (packs) are opened; it is smoothly metallic and shiny and doesn't fit with the pixel art of the cards. Perhaps Counterplay is trying to appease people who dislike the pixel art style, but I would prefer a unified art direction, personally.2. Each faction has access to two generals that have 1 mana (blood born) spells that they can use after the early stages of the game (similar to hero abilities in Hearthstone). The game is not properly balanced around some general's blood born spells (bbs), especially a general named Kara: Kara's bbs is that she buffs every minion in her action bar by 1+/1+ for 1 mana. Oftentimes this results in a 5+/5+ buff over 5 minions for 1 mana, which is clearly stronger than a lot of other bbs's. This balance issue won't affect new players -- really , because playing bad cards and misplaying are the primary factors for new players losing, but at the highest level of play, Kara reigns supreme. I expect balance fixes to Kara and others in the upcoming expansion on Aug. 31th, however.3. It does take a bit of grinding to unlock all the basic cards and generals once you start playing. This wouldn't be problematic for a player who wants to familiarize themselves with all the different factions before deciding what to play, but some new players may want to have a deck with a particular locked general with all the basic cards, so that they can jump right into ranked.4. There isn't an unranked mode; only practice (against the AI), ranked, or gauntlet (which is the draft mode). 5. For tournament play, you need to be friends with your opponent in order to challenge them to a match (no in-game tournament system, as yet), allowing them to potentially watch your replays or view your match history, in order to gain information about what you're likely to play. 6. The battlelog that keeps track of what cards have been played doesn't keep track of what card was replaced, which is important when viewing a replay, since replaces happen quickly on the screen, and it's sometimes hard to tell what card was replaced.Conclusion:Overall, if the art style isn't a deal breaker for you, and you can be patient while unlocking the basic cards and generals, and you can accept that no card game is perfectly balanced (and the balance is far from abysmal in Duelyst), and you don't care that there isn't an unranked mode, then Duelyst is an enjoyable experience that I would recommend.

												I've played TCGs and CCGs for a good part of my life, mostly MTG and I've never found a game I've enjoyed more until this. Duelyst combines great pixel-art, which classic card mechanics in a square grid who adds a whole other layer into the gameplay. The only problem is, as with most card games, the lack of cards for new players, even if Duelyst does have so much better rarity ratios than other digital games and a bunch of methods of getting gold when you start (bunch of hidden quests, challenges and also dailies) AND very great deals (buyings orbs + legendaries for 5 USD, last complete expansion costs 20 USD or 3900 gold which is less than a month of doing all daily quests) you might feel overpowered once you rank up and make progress if you stay F2P for a while. But don't panic, give it a try, keep playing, participate in the free events over battelfy (some with orb and other prizes that CounterPlay gives) and your collection will grow in no time!			"

												Honestly I only played this game for the pixel art. I don't care about Card Games. Sure I will like the gameplay and multiplayer's competitiveness like any other gamer, but I won't get committed to such games. The only reason I have 100+ hours for this game is because I wanted to see every pixel unit in action and because the matches are super quick, which makes this game perfect for a short 5~10 minute game session.The name of the pixel art artist is Glauber Kotaki and he made the overall art for games like Rogue Legacy, Deep Dungeons of Doom and the upcoming game Chasm. I now realize I would play any game that guy makes art for: http://glauberkotaki.com/

												Don't let my playtime fool you, I've easily put over 500 hours into DUELYST since I got into the alpha back in 2014. The game has changed so much since then; Counterplay games has done an amazing job creating your new favorite CCG.Some things that set DUELYST apart from the rest:- Replace! Once per turn, you can shuffle a card back into your deck and be guaranteed to draw a different card.- Very generous economy! You can easily earn a pack of cards daily and drop rates for legendary and epic cards are much higher than other CCGs.- Depth of Deckbuilding! There are so many crazy deck ideas, and while they may not all be 100% competitively viable, it's fun to build and play decks with interesting synergies.- Monthly cards! Four new cards added to the game each month. You can even win copies of the cards based on your ladder placement for the month.- Daily Puzzle Challenge! Earn a bit of gold while learning about interesting card interactions. I've been playing for almost 2 years and some of the puzzles still take me a while to figure out :P- Responsive Developers! Counterplay has been relatively quick to address problem cards. And if cards get changed, you can disenchante them for full value.This is just a small list of things that have kept me playing this game for so long. The pixel art is gorgeous, the gameplay is quick but still tactical and the developers continue to improve the game with new features and content.There is a new expansion coming at the end of the month, so this is a perfect time for new players to begin!See you on the battlefield!

												I'm pretty torn as far as what I think about the game. The gameplay, art style and thematics are fantastic. I am enjoying it but as with most F2P games I have an extremely hard time wanting to buy into the monetization scheme. I find that the pricing is just too rich for my tastes. A purchase of 40 card packs for $50.00 is a fairly big price to pay, especially when there's no guarantee that you'll obtain the 'content' that you might be looking for. Furthermore, trying to price at the same levels as Hearthstone seems to be a poor strategy as being a direct competitor this game has no where near the same following.  I think that the devs could attract a lot more interest if they aggressively priced things lower in order to attract more users but I can't see it happening. "

												I can't recommend this game anymore. While the game's depth and tactical gameplay and fantastic art initially drew me in, the game falls apart at higher levels of play. Optimized decks focus around powerful minions with immediate impact (like Rush cards, who don't have to wait a turn to attack) and removal cards. The Vanar faction in particular specializes in dispelling/transforming/removing every single card the opponent plays. Do not be fooled by the screenshots on the store page showcasing complex board states with multiple minions in formation.The developers seemingly have no issue with the design of the game revolving around ""Answer-or-die"" threats kept only in check by cheap removal cards, having just printed an expansion featuring more of both.Steer clear.

												Been playing this game since the beta release. Probably the best online Trading Card Game (TCG) out. If you love building decks or tactics based board games, then this is the game for you.Personally, I have never really played a card game before this, but with the added layer of board game strategy, it really hooked me in. The animations and art are great, the quality of the game in general is exceptional.And most importantly from a TCG standpoint, the way you earn Spirit and Gold (or dust, or whatever you want to call TCG crafting currency) is very fair and generous.Check this game out!

												Dueylst is a pretty entertaining card-game with wonderfully done art and character design, as well as an intricate story and lore-filled world found in various scripts on cards. That being said; the gameplay WAS fun. Now its just an awful contest to see who kills the other the fastest using  horribly unbalanced cards and spells, And of course, countering such with the same spells/minions to save their hides. Of course you have to be lucky in order to have these cards in your hand because otherwise you are just going to spend the game prolonging your slow defeat. This basic strategy is of course viable in every deck; However, the Vanar are the living embodiement of this. All of their cards/spells are centered around dumping impecable amounts of dps on the battlefield, all the while disabling anything that could possibly save you..... Quite a problem indeed.All of this could be remedied by tweaks in gameplay mechanics and nerfing  stupendiously overpowered cards so all the other wonderful and creative decks could actually be enjoyable to play. HOWEVER the devs seemingly prefer to simply pump out packs and even more packs absolutely brimming with cards more powerful and abusable than the last. Thus the problem that now plagues this game. It's rather irksome and so i can't bring myself to reccomend this game to anyone, but it is a free game afterall, and you can tell much effort has been put into the design. In the end, the decision is yours to like or hate this game. Let my review be a warning, not something to inherently change your mind.Tldr; Game has wonderful art but major balancing issues. "

												!!!!MAKE SURE TO GET THE FREE 20 CARD PACKS AND COSMETICS FROM HUMBLE BUNDLE!!!!! Edit: Note they stopped giving away the code now, but they can be  redeemed until nov 17. Try finding a code from the internetThe first thing anyone does with a online card gamae is compare it to hearthstone. That is understandable as blizzard filled the hunger for online card games that many developers ignored. However many people, as well as I felt Heartstone was bland and unfufilling. The art style was too main stream, the omni prescint RNG was frustrating, the game never felt truly like a card game ( Yu-gi-oh or MTG), and I always felt like Hearthstone was trying to milk me for money because it was too unrewarding being a free player.Duelyst improves on many aspects on Hearthstone. There is more strategey in Duelyst due to a implementation of a chess board which gives a whole dimension on positioning your cards and utilizing cards to affect your opponents positioning. This positioning allows for a larger variety of card effects than what hearthstone allows. There backstab cards which deal additonal damage and receive no damage when attacking the back of a creature, there are cards which move your creatures and the opposing players creatures around. Flying cards can move to any space in the board which can ♥♥♥♥ up if you have on weaksauce card that is essential to your strategey and don't protect it with other cards.You can also shuffle one  card into your deck and draw a new card every turn, allowing card drawing cards to be less powerful than traditional card games. There are are at least two very obvious strategies for each class, with many less obvious ones as well, but that might require looking for decklists online. There are 6 classses, with two different hero powers you can choose, each one powerful in its own way.I have not felt punished for being a free player. Fifteen gold is gained every two wins on top of the daily quests and hidden acheivments. The Gauntlet is not as punishing as hearthstone arena, in hearthstone if you went 0-3 you would get 5 gold or so awarded. When i went 0-3 I got 15 gold. You also get legendary cards much more frequently than in hearthstone, I have gotten a legendary in at least every 5 packs.The art style is vibrant pixel art which is a pleasure to view.!!!MAKE SURE TO GET THE FREE 20 CARD PACKS AND COSMETICS FROM HUMBLE BUNDLE!!!Use the referral code ""opensheep"" so you gain 100 gold starting out, people don't actually get gold for referring people unless they reach silver/gold rank in solo que. Which could take quite a while. So don't think I'm trying to milk you.I also made a steam group, which you may want to join if you want advice or friends to play with! Additonally I will organize tournaments in the future.			"

												Firstly a few credentials. I reached high diamond (highest rank behind S-rank) about 3-4 times and was extremely active on the forums during the games beta. I played many, many hours on the standalone client so my game time should not be taken at face valueThis game used to be strategic and fun, with board control counting for most wins, now it has changed into a swingy, aggro fest which is decided by luck in the first few turns. The power creep has made killing your opponent before they can react the prime strategy which is uninteractive to say the least. The game is also now behind a paywall, with 2 sets in exclusive, high cost orbs that unlock a pitiful amount of cards and require hours of grinding. This game takes all bad aspects of the frontrunner, Hearthstone and multiplies them by 10xDevs also cannot seem to find a good balance, with massive card changes often, upsetting the meta and rendering most of your decks useless, making it hard to build faction identity and loyalty with its players.The developer actually scrapped the forums for a long period of time because they could not handle community outcry at some of their decisions, if that isn't telling enough then I don't know what is.Aviod, check out other great f2p cardgames that have sprung up all over the show.

												A great game overall. Ive played many turn-based games in my time, and i never liked any of them. I remember a while back me and my friend where looking for F2P games on steam, i saw this, and i just kinda glossed over it, saying ""Oh, its a turn based game"". Later, i found the trailer for Duelyst on youtube, and decided to give it a try. I DO NOT REGRET IT! The game has incredible, and i mean INCREDIBLE pixel art, a great story, and beutiful arenas. However, its not perfect, so ill do some pro and con listing:Pros:1: Fun2: Beutiful3: Immersive4: Great game to practice strategy5: Vetruvian6: Fun deck-making7: abyssianCons:1: Songhai2: Bad matchmaking3: Has a relativley steep learning curve, if you havent played many Turned based games4: Chest keys can only be purchased through real currency5: Gold is hard to earn6: Sometimes spirit orbs can really screw you over7: Decimus			"

												Duelyst is an awesome board card game.For comparing the game with Hearstone (like all other card game nowaday) it's the same ""style"" with a gridded board where placement is very important because you gonna need to move your minion to beat your opponent.Here the main point of the game  * Gridded board  ( 5*9 ) where units can move (2 square )   * Strategy game ( sometime can be very tricky like puzzle )  * 300+ cards where each card have an unique pixel art style ( monster/spell )  * Very low randomness aspect (in my opinion after playing Hearstone)  * True F2P ( can have access to a strong deck after playing a little )  * Awesome community (trying to help new people)  * Counterplay Games Inc. really take care of his community (listen their feedback about rebalance)If you like card game, you gonna absolutely enjoying this game, just give it a try, it's free and really fun :)PS: Sorry for my bad english, I'm not an english person, but needed to say how the game is good.

												When it comes to Duelyst, the comparison with Hearthstone is easily made. The way you earn cards is the same, the ranked system is the same, the mana system is the same and the way classes work is the same, complete with special power.However, there's a few very key differences between the two games that make Duelyst less random and, to me at least, more fun: The board on which you play as well as the ability to replace a card from your hand once per turn.The board in combination with the various cards makes for some really deep and satisfying tactical play that allows you to bend the game to your favour with smart decisions. Every turn the board looks different as there's so much going on and every turn has a very large amount of decisions that you can make. I really enjoy this the most as a fervent tactical turn-based gamer. If you like the combat in XCOM and Age of Wonders 3, you will find lots to love here.Other plusses are the quick matchmaking, the active developers, the gorgeous pixel art and animations and the large amount of interesting lore.I am personally not a fan of random stuff (which is why I stopped playing Hearthstone) and to me Duelyst strikes the perfect balance between randomness and tactics. Highly recommended!			"

												Card game with two major layers of strategy. There's the bog standard Magic: The Gathering* gameplay that leads into the  2nd layer of gameplay with the placement and movement of your cards on a battlefield. The added depth means skill can trump raw card power; however while learning the game you will end up getting crushed under raw power this is part of the learning process. Once you start to get a card base going and you learn the different faction styles/cards the game truely opens up.Duelyst hits the sweet spots of collecting sweet cards while tinkering with decks. The duels themselves become more involved with the added complexity of positioning over simple attack and block. If you're willing to sink some time into Duelyst you'll be rewarded with a compelling and fulfilling experience.*Instead of a land system used in Magic, Duelyst has set mana that increases each turn.

												Abosultely love this game! The strategy needed due to the infinite possibilities between the game board, placement of ""cards"", and of course the kick @$$ pixel graphics!!  A very satisfying game that could easily be played and enjoyed without spending a penny of ""real money"".  The daily quests (and free card) can get you enough gold to buy spirit orbs (card packs), gauntlet tickets (arena/draft play) and bloodborn orbs (card packs with cards you DONT have!).  Yes, if you get a crate you need a key to open it which costs $4.99.. BUT they did recently implement a ""common crate"" key reward for 15 quests completed in a month (easy).  However, if you are worried that you will be missing out on items due to not wanting to buy crates they are mostly filled with cosmetic items with 1 card here and there so they are not required to complete your card collection. The last thing I want to touch on, which is one of my favorites, is the fact that each ""faction"" or class does not only have 1 type of general that has the same hero power no matter the skin or avatar.  There are multiple general (main hero/""face"") options for each faction AND your general always has at least 2 attack and can  move around the board like a chess piece, the same as your minions, instead of just being your avatar with a set power that never moves or defends themself without a weapon equipped.To get the FULL experience and really find out I suggest you JUST PLAY IT.  Nothing to lose since it is F2P, the system requirements are low, and if you want to get a free spirit orb (or just 100 gold) use my referral code ""gdaddanyt"" and friend me to play some matches!! :)			"

												I've been playing this game for quite some time. I like it and recommend it to anyone who enjoys card games.WARNING: I will compare Duelyst with Hearthstone quite a bit. The reason, is because it has some key similarites to Hearthstone but there are a few things, that in my opinion, make this game slightly better.Compared with Hearthstone:- Importance of proper positioning. I know Hearthstone has positioning as well but having a board makes positioning even more important.- Better access for F2P players. I'm sorry but my biggest issue with Hearthstone is that you have to WIN games to complete your daily quests. Duelyst only requires you to PLAY games. They give you slightly less gold but it is still worth it. I've earned a lot of free booster packs just completing daily quests.- Better first turns. In my opinion, Hearthstones first few turns can be slow. Duelyst generally starts off with interesting situations and it feels like the game actually starts when you start playing.- Better disenchanting rates. Last I checked, it only takes 4 commons to craft a new common. In Hearthstone I think it takes 8.Other pros that have nothing to do with Hearthstone:- Great little pixel art animations. Really, if you enjoy pixel art you might give this game a go just to enjoy the pixel art for a few games.- Fun daily challenges.- Great faction variety.- Lovely character concept art.Cons:- No unranked mode. When you play other people (outside of friend battles and gauntlet) it is always ranked.- Crate system. I guess I don't mind getting their loot crates but at least let me remove the stupid notifications about them. Or let me delete them.There are my thoughts. Honestly, I'm rather addicted to this game. It has been one of the funnest games for me to play in my down-time and I enjoy the fact that I get a new challenge every game, and can play without having to dedicate hours and hours of my time to get anything out of it. 20-30 minutes can give you a couple decent games.If you want to add me, my username is Torrid.

												I can't recommend this game.  It used to be good, but the devs make terrible decisions based on the idea that frustrating or annoying play is fun.  There is little development on using the board for play because it is a card game now, and not a tactics one.  The neutral card pool has grown too large for my liking, neutering faction Identities in Gauntlet.  The 'random' keyword causes oppressive fun in Season play, e.g Meltdown being played because it is a requirement.  As I said, it was good, like Hearthstone and Cards & Castles.  I recommend looking into Faeria and ShardBound for the itch scratching.			"

												I've been in love with TCG/CCGs since I began playing at the age of 8 with my big brother and his friends. 20 years later I was lucky enough to find Duelyst. Some of my favorites growing up have been Netrunner and Magic the Gathering. Recently, while scrolling through my Steam 'recommend for you' section, I came across Duelyst.I was immediately drawn to the pixel art sprites. The beautiful high res and pixel art graphics blend really works here. Stunning visuals, music and sfx. Really well put together aesthetically, so gorgeous.Duelyst gives the player so many choices to make. Things I particularly love in terms of game play are replacing cards each turn, the great big board, the neutral cards, the ability to place and move cards/units around the board really pushes you to think and plan ahead that much more. The factions are awesome, each comes with different play styles and each can be tweaked to create new play styles. With such a massive variety of card types, through archetype decks and neutral cards you can really custom craft your deck. The 'luck of the draw' element is still always present in Duelyst, thanks to the card replacement mechanic. You can completely switch up the game with one replacement or you can draw a garbage card and headbutt the keyboard as you have your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you. Duelyst is FREE TO PLAY. This is one of the best free to pay games I've ever played, of any genre. I am happy to have put some cash into the game for some booster packs(orbs). The developers have produced something so special I'm currently at just over 30 play hours, I've not been playing competitive for long as I wanted to fully understand the different archetype decks. Another thing I should mention - When I've played with friends or online I've pretty much had the stuffing kicked out of me. I was not as prepared as I thought. But I had a ball, even when I lose, games are so varied and fun. The community around Duelyst seem to be really fun and laid back, I'm not seeing any snippy remarks or arrogance. I'd like to thank Counterplay Games, you guys absolutely smashed it. I really hope player numbers will continue to grow, please support the developers to keep adding additional content. I know I will.Come and join our Facebook fan group, we'll be hosting tournaments with awesome prizes.https://www.facebook.com/groups/2079880545571034/ "

												Not going to lie, this game can be extremely fun to play. Yet I won't recommend this game because of its absurd pay-wall tactics. I get it, it is a free to play game, and I understand the system. I am perfectly fine with having a system where someone with a heavy wallet can shell out a few bucks (or a bunch) to buy cards/cosmetics/ect. Yet the way this game makes you think you are going to get a ""reward"" and then hide it behind a pay-wall is very deceptive.I just completed the special PVE boss event, which proclaims from the main menu that you get a unique reward upon completion. Spent at least an hour customizing my deck until I could defeat it. What reward do I get? A boss crate that can't even be opened unless I shell out an extra $4.99 for a boss crate key. This only adds to my collection of ""rare"" crates that I can't open because the only keys a free-to-play account can get are common crate keys (afaik).Basically, the ""rewards"" the game gives to their dedicated FTP playerbase can't even be opened without spending money. Just another fun game ruined by a bad business model.			"

												This is a very different game to other card games so those who are put off by what they assume it is should realise that it is a lot more focussed on tactical combat than it is on spamming cards onto a board. In fact the differing factions and units are so diverse that play can be almost chess-like at times. It also has an interesting back story in the codex but this does not appear to have any tangible effect other than telling a slightly confusing story. It isn't perfect but it is certainly accomplished. If, like me, you are not a fan of pixel graphics then it will take a little getting used to but what is more important is the depth of strategy and the way the ftp model is (currently) very fair. For these two reasons alone it is well worth a look and likely to be worth persevering with. Yet it is primarilly intended as a multiplayer game so anyone looking for a single player experience should look elsewhere.*edit* I should also mention that on the rare occurance of a technical fault it is fixed extremely quickly and matchmaking is always very quick with no dcs.

												I loved Final Fantasy Tactics. I loved Hearthstone. I used to play Magic: TG competitively.This, no matter what it is being called, is none of those things. It steals ideas from all of those things, sure, but as a cohesive package? It has no original identity of its own, just the cobbled together parts of other, better things. However, it does these things so well that I can't help but enjoy it as more than the sum of its (somewhat) stolen mechanics. It's greatly enjoyable. I don't know what is so compelling about it, but despite my initially negative impressions, I find myself wanting to dig in to it more. In today's flooded market that is saying something rather impressive.			"

												Duelyst is a card game and tactics hybrid where you create a deck of units and spells and then play them out against your opponent on a tile based board. What I especially liked about this game was the movement and positioning that are required for the tactics portion of the game. Due to this a number of my really good matches were won through careful choices, calculated risks and proper strategic positioning of units rather than luck of the draw. That isn't to say luck of the draw doesn't happen given the card game nature of the game, but I've felt less of my matches came down to this than it did my opponent or myself playing well. I really enjoyed my time with Duelyst and am quite glad I gave it a shot despite it being F2P.			"

This game combines many great elements from other card games.Is is a very fun game which requires you to actually plan ahead, think where to put your pieces and so on...

 REVIEW UPDATED 5 MARCH 2017 This game is a big YES for all TCG + Strategy fans out there! Pros:  HUGE CARD SELECTION (6 Faction + 1 Neutral) 6 Faction with each 2 general and different playstyle which mean there is so many cards to collect and absolutely infinite possibilities of card combo that will hook you to create more decks to play! Easy Grinding For someone who afraid to get into this game because you guys think that its gonna be grindy to collect card without dropping some money, YOU GUYS ARE WRONG! Duelyst have a quest which give gold (currency to buy spirit orbs). 2 Quest each give 20G and 50G + First win of the day 20G + 3 Win 15G = 105 Gold each day. With that you can buy 1 spirit orb. Also Duelyst daily free card make it easier for you to collect cards. For new player they can finish Solo Challenges to get gold and for a boost you can use my REFFERAL code to get 100G: yeahjah Strategic Gameplay With the gameplay using card to summon your unit / cast a spell into the game board makes the gameplay more strategic. Using the combination of that and positioning you try to outplay your enemy and winning the game. Also there is mana system to limit the card summoning which make the user think twice about summoning the card, whether he/she should summon this or that card.  6 Gamemodes -Practice: Play versus AI to test your deck or train your skill.-Season Ladder: Compete against other player to climb up rank (monthly) and earn prizes at the end of season depending on your rank.-Solo Challenges: Learn gameplay mechanics and earn reward.-The Gauntlet: Draft mode. Get as many win as possible until you lose 3 times and earn reward based on how much you win.-Friendly Match: Play against your friend.-Boss Battle: Fight AI Boss with unique mechanic. Graphic This game has its own pixelart style which make its looks kinda unique than any other similar games. Good Community The community in this game is pretty good. They act and speak good, and eventually will help other players. Active Events Beside the good community, this game also have an active events. From tournament to other events that you can see here:  Duelyst Events [news.duelyst.com] Lore/Story included Its not just about the game! There is also story in it. Explore the amazing lore of Duelyst from beginning to upcoming lore to be explained. (10 Chapter + more to come) Cons: ----------------------- Closing Overall, this game is a must if you are TCG + Strategy fans!!Also, to get a head start of 100 Gold use my refferal code: yeahjahHope to see you in a match! :D			"

												For the first 48 hours of gameplay it was good, but honestly I stopped playing because I couldn't sustain gold and didn't really feel like putting in so much work and get cases that I can't open and log back in to see a quest that says (complete 15 quests for a common case key) sorry but I don't see that as something that is rewarding at all, this game is cool and all but doesn't match up to other games that actually reward players with packs and what not more often so you actually WANT to log in everyday and play.

												Been playing for a couple of months (outside of steam, hence my hours of course), and it's a great game. It takes the great, fun aspects of Hearthstone and puts it on a 5x9 grid-based board. Putting it's own twists on classic CCGs, it creates an entirely new and unique game that's easy to get into but difficult to master. Great sound, great art, great gameplay, and a great game in general. It's free, why not?			"

												Duelyst is a card-based strategy game with where you can battle other players and friends.Negative:- If You're Using A Laptop, It Murders your Battery- You can't do offline mode.Positive:- Matches are fairly short 3-5 minutes long.- You get to collect cards for no cost.- Free!- It Has A Variety of Cards with Different Abilities.Overall:It's a pretty fun game but it's reccomended for people using PCs or Laptops that are plugged into the charger constantly. I swear your battery will literally die if you run this game. However, it's an amazing and addicting game that can definitely get you hooked. "

												For those that love card cames like Magic and Hearthstone, this game is definitely for you. Whilst keeping with the traditional mana system and the easy to learn attack/defence mechanics, the new addition of a board to traverse, rather than just sides with cards, brings a huge new element of strategy into every game. Not only will you be trying set up card combos to try and take down the enemy, you must think about positioning and movement tactics to gain the upper hand in every battle, allowing for large amounts of variety in each match. This also allows decks to not be held up to one strategy, as simply moving a single minion can completely allow for a new strategy.This game is truly one of those, easy to learn, hard to master types of games, and with it being free, there is really no reason to try it out for yourself.

												I've been involved in the Duelyst community for two and a half years now, so let me say with certainty that while the positive thoughts everyone else is displaying here about the game are most certainly true, the community are also excellent. After all, if they weren't, there's no way so many of our veteran players would have stuck around and continued to love the game in the way they have.Aside from the fun to be had at the forums, discord and subreddit, the game itself is packed with excellent depth and replayability, a constantly changing meta and an intense competitive scene. All in all, it's a game anyone should try out and play, whether you're new to the genre, a fan of classic games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Advance Wars, or simply looking for a competitive strategy game without pay-to-win elements.

Highly-polished collectable card game with a twist of Grid-based-Strategy-RPG, tons of cards to collect, and awesome pixel-art animated graphics.Tip for new players: Use my referral code losingstreak to get 100 free gold. Just click ""Friends"" on the bottom-right corner of the main menu, click on ""claim a friend's referral code"" and input losingstreak to get your 100 free gold. (only applicable if you have not yet played ranked/ladder)Pros and cons:Pros:+Not P2W: Gold is pretty easy to earn, making it fairly easy to advance and make a competitive deck without purchasing using real money+Six factions to play that each have their own unique strategies and skills +Lots of faction cards that are unique to their faction and tons of non-faction-specific neutral cards add a lot of variety and depth to deck-making+Draft mode that gives good rewards even if you don't get far (similar to Arena in Hearthstone, but less punishing)+Much less RNG than Hearthstone (if you hate Yogg, you'll like this one)+Good music and awesome pixel-art animated graphics+Can reconnect if you disconnect mid-match; just don't take too long or the game will automatically concede for youCons:-Games can drag on especially if the enemy is turtling or roping-Cannot chat with other players in a match, you can only use preset emotes and quotesBonus Tips for free stuff:~Duel with a friend to get a one-time-only free pack~Play with each faction atleast once to get a free random-faction legendary card			"

												Hopefully someone will see this and read it before spending money on the game.  On the surface it is a great game, there appear to be layers of strategy and mechanics that attempt to minimize RNG and coming from HS that is just huge.  After a few hours playing the game you begin to realize that is mostly just smoke and mirrors though.  The draw of the ""board"" and interaction between the different mechanics starts to fade into the background as you realize the designers for all of their apparent good intent don't have a terribly solid grasp of card game design.  As of now in the post expansion meta there are 4 different decks that can reliably put 14+ damage on your life total out of hand with no real way to counter it.  The worst offender is Songhia, the so called meld deck is just like playing against miracle rogue back in the early days of HS.  Not only can they just win without any input from you(no, positioning tricks and praying RNG puts the second boar in a bad spot does not count, at all) even if they don't win the match is incredibly boring.  There are other examples of poor design that is rapidly leading to a stale and boring meta devoid of any fun what so ever but I think the worst example is the best and will leave it at that.  I struggle to find positives about this game but for the sake of fairness I will say the art is great, really tickles that pixel itch you may or mat not get on occasion.I really wanted to like this game and I hope they will go back to the drawing board on at least most of these issues but I don't see that happening any time soon.  So for now it is a very sad thumbs down from me.Update 11/6/16So, they did a balance pass.  One of the big ones was they nerfed a card that everyone has access to and can be played around, and didn't touch the insane out of hand damage half the factions are capable of.  I have a theory the out of hand damage (ei, the damage you can not stop or interact with at all) was such a bedrock of the game core that altering it or taking it out would destroy any ability the devs have to push the game forward and as a result they aren't doing anything at all.  At this point any faith I had that things would be fixed or get better are gone.Note this review and update are here because at one point I thought the game had a lot of potential to be something special in the otherwise god awful electronic CCG market.  But turns out it isn't.  So please, avoid this thing and if you do decide to try it out (after all it starts out free) please do not spend a dime on it.  Learn from my mistake.			"

												Oh man… What to say about Duelyst…Quick background/ context for this review. My ign is JuveyD, I’ve been playing for 5 months. I have casted several tournaments, achieved S-Rank three times, and my peak position on the ladder with 18th.I’ll start with the basic +/-‘s of the game, and then get in to what I think makes this game SO unique.+ Not pay to win. PLENTY of people have gotten to S-Rank (the top rank) with “budget decks.” Basically, decks that you can make with cards that are easy to acquire. You can get packs (also known as spirit orbs) pretty easily at the start to build up your collection.+ The artwork. If you enjoy pixel art, you’re about your mind. Even if you don’t, there is still a really good chance this will impress you. The expansion in a week will introduce 105 new cards to the 300+ collection. Every month the developers release four new cards as ladder rewards.+ Rewarding skill. A lot of card games (i.e. Hearthstone) seem to rely on a fair bit of RNG. There is nothing wrong with that to some people, but a lot of people want a game that is more reliant on skill. This is still a card game, so luck plays a part. But cycling through decks is easier because of the replace feature, my next +. + The replace feature. This is such a big deal to me, because I have never seen anything like it. At the start of every turn, you can replace one card from your hand to draw another card from your deck. This lowers the RNG factor, and increases the amount of skill/ thought that goes into each turn.+ The community. These are just good people. It isn’t hard to get to know people. There are dedicated Discord servers like Duelyst Official, the official tournament channel, and several other personal channels for streamers and other game-related events. I would HIGHLY encourage joining some of these and meeting the people who play the game. A ton of them (myself included) are willing to teach new players the ropes. ALSO, JOIN TOURNAMENTS! I think there are other positives to the game, but I don’t want to ramble/ overpraise the game. If anything above sounds appealing, then you should download it and give it a shot. If you want the negative side, here are the few things I’ll say:- You WILL lose at first. Whether it be the learning curve, or the fact that someone spent money and draws several legendary cards in a game against you. It is easy to blame this on RNG or the fact that it feels “pay to win.” But you CAN beat those expensive decks. The nature of this game is that most players float around a 40-60% win rate. This has to be something you’re okay with during your first week of playing.- After the first week, grinding for decks gets a little tiring, imo. The first week you unlock packs for doing things like challenging friends, leveling up factions, etc. After you get those 10ish packs, you need to save up gold and do gauntlet runs. This can be a bit daunting to some. I’d advise watching some streams or YouTube videos to help guide you through that process.Anyways, that’s my review. I’m bias because this is probably my favorite online game of all time and I’m very happy to see it come to Steam. I give it a 10/10 and HIGHLY recommend it. I hope you enjoy it. Here is a YouTube video I made awhile back for new players. Some info is a little dated, but it gives a pretty good overview of the factions/playstyles:

												I don't usually write reviews but I have to for this game. Note that I have been playing this game for a month before Steam so my steam hours don't show my experience (granted I am still fairly new). Duelyst is an amazing mixture of card and board games. I think of it like combining hearthstone with chess. Its like hearthstone but with less rng and hence more skill based. You could play the best cards and still lose due to poor positioning so it brings another layer of strategy. I recommend trying this game, its free so why not? If you like hearthstone, you will like this game and if you like hearthstone and wish there was less rng, you will love this game. Things I like about this game are:  Quests require you to PLAY games not WIN games  You get 2 quests per day and can reroll them. You also get 15 gold per 2 wins. This and other little bonuses make Duelyst a really nice F2P game. (Of course you can still buy orbs [pack of cards]).  As I said before, positioning and less rng cards make this a less frustrating experience as playing more skillfully will give reward you.The only thing some may consider negative in this game is some pricing. The pricing for orbs are actually really fair (similar price to HS, maybe cheaper). And you get a ton more gold per day so you don't even need to spend money unless you want to (I haven't yet but that may change as I really like this game). However the pricing for cosmetic items like emotes is fairly high. You get crates randomly as you play and to open these crates you need a key. These keys can cost up to $10. This sounds expensive but remember you don't need to buy this as its only a cosmetic item which doesn't affect your game play at all.			"

												Don't let my playtime fool you.I've played this game for a lot of hours before it came to steam.While this may look like a hearthstone clone, it is actually much, much more.Duelyst is an incredible, gorgeous, well polished, competitive strategic board game based on card decks.Mastering this game is a real challenge since unlike other card games, this one requires good planning, positioning, complex strategies and an experienced knowledge of hundreds of difficult game mechanics.Compared to hearthstone you gain way more good cards from packs which helps you creating a good budget deck pretty early in the game, legendaries  are also way more common than HS, in other words less pay 2 win. You can also put the same card 3 times in the same deck (while in hearthstone you can only put 2 copies) and you can switch a card from your hand to your deck every turn. All of this makes the game waaaay less luck based than hearthstone.Have fun :)			"

												The functions of the actual game is nice, as is hero skills.This is however either pay-to-win or played-long-time-to-win,  have had my fair share of those type of card games. Enough is Enough.  They say any decks even non-legendary can win, but when you go down below rank 10, ppl will push out Unique > Legendary card  each turn,   some of them makes you lose on the spot unless you got equal strong cards.For example ""Summon 4 eggs on random locations"" >  which spawns 6/6 Lizzard Hero, who in turns produce more 6/6 heroes.On turn 7, you will now face 8x 6/6 Lizzards producing even more..   Lost 3 games in a row simply not having an instant-counter (or even having a counter in my whole deck, since disable guy is melee range, and no offensive spells).Game is ok in itself,  but getting 1-2 legendary cards per Month, vs ppl playing them each turn?     Enough of this already.			"

												The mix of CCG and Tactics make this a truly unique game, and for this I really enjoy it. Unfortunately, I don't understand why the game is free. While it is nice to just play, if you want to do well at the game (and let's face it, many of us do) the best of what the game has to offer is hidden behind a paywall or hours of grinding. I cannot stand this concept in gaming, but whatever. It's become so commonplace nowadays that it's hard to argue it anymore at this point.The paywall isn't my only issue though. The factions are horribly unbalanced, with a few clearly standing superior to the rest. When I first started, I thought this was going to be a checks and balances system of Faction A is good against Faction B which is good against Faction C and so on...this was not the case.I can't say that I would readily recommend this game. While it does offer a unique style of gameplay, the limitations set upon the player to stand a solid chance without having to pay really hinders the game in my opinion.			"

												Duelyst is a nice free-to-play collectible card/strategy game. It's like a TCG mixed with Heroscape.  You summon creatures to fight for you and then move them around a board.  My favorite aspects of the game are the free nature of it and the daily challenges. While I refrain from using real money on FtP games I did like the small rewards from the challenges. Playing certain decks, doing specific actions in-game, or completing puzzles gave you a little bonus. I liked it.			"

In addition to a great balance if temporary and permanent progression, the games aren't too long, which is what I've found with a lot of other games (ex: MOBA or RTS).

												Preface: I have played this game for months on the native client before the Steam version came out. This is why I only have minimal time shown on the Steam version. :)I have been a Collectible Card Game enthusiast (and ex-pro) for years. I also appreciate a game with a high amount of polish and attention put into the experience and presentation. This is the reason I originally gravitated to Hearthstone. It was ""easy to learn and difficult to master"". Duelyst was clearly inspired by Hearthstone, but they have something that few other collectible card games offer - a game board. In Hearthstone, positioning your minions occasionally has implications, but most of the time it serves no purpose. Contrast this to Duelyst where positioning your minions is completely core to the experience and it adds a richness of tactical depth that games like Hearthstone will never achieve -- and it does so without complicating the mechanics. Duelyst is not like chess where every piece has its own movement rules. Every minion moves exactly the same - 2 squares (with a couple of exceptions based on very clear card text).The quest system is also amazing - there are quests like ""Play 4 games with X faction"" - doesn't even matter if you lose, you still get credit, and I find this has a huge emotional and psychological impact.At first I was put off by the gorgeous UI and background art combined with the odd 8-bit pixel style of the characters on the board. But it's definitley grown on me, and I've come to really enjoy it.As other reviewers have mentioned, Duelyst is extremely generous with gold and resources for a free-to-play game, better than Hearthstone as a comparison.TLDR: Duelyst is a collectible card game with a unique additional element of a game board, which adds a nice extra layer of tactical depth without being too complex. If you've ever played a CCG, you can instantly pick this game up and ""get it"". The art is beautiful, the rewards are more than fair, and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys CCG's, board games, or tactics games like Fire Emblem.			"

												Easily one of the best card-based TBS in the market right now. Pros:+ As an artist, this game has absolutely state of the art pixel art and animation.+ Devs actually trying to make factions different from each other with defined playstyle. + Devs taking advantage of this game being a digital card game, card balancing are plentiful, keeping the game balancing at a relatively healthy state. + Great F2P experience. Monthly rewards are generous as most players can make a budget deck and get the best time-for-effort reward available without much trouble. + Extremely good core gameplay mechanic, reminds me somewhat of FF Tactic or Fire Emblems. + Replace mechanic is extremely helpful on reducing the RNG nature of card game. Less dead draws more space for players to put in tech cards.Cons:- Competitive decks can be hard to craft as most of them runs 3-4 legendaries, each of them cost quite alot to craft as some might required 3 copies.- Tempo driven game that favors playing good minions on curve. - Early game can be very one-sided if you don't have good early drops to contest mana-tiles. Losing out on early game control can be quite hard to comeback. - Generals and their BBS (think hero power from HS) designs, while promote a playstyle and basically guide the designs of cards, can also limit what type of deck can be used for the faction. - Neutral minions (even commons) are VERY strong compared to game like Hearthstone. This can be a pro or con depends on players. Decks are cheaper because several decks use the same good neutral minions, but you will end up battling the same 5-6 minions that are staple for all decks (Think Blistering Skorn, Jaxi, Mystic healer etc..) - Expensive cosmetic. Overall great game, it has alot of protential to topple giants like Hearthstone, and it's coming to mobile market too. 8.5/10Source: I play this game for almost a year.			"

												Duelyst is a tactical turn-based collectable card game with beautiful pixel art. It perfectly mixes the correct elements of different genres to make each and every game is different. Duelyst will keep you engaged and addicted after hundreds of hours. It is really easy to learn, but extremely hard to master.Duelyst is heavily focused on player verses player combat, using six different factions; each with there own unique keywords and abilities to stomp your opponents to victory. You can start off by crafting your deck and practicing against different faction AI's as well as completing a ton of challenges in order to learn the ins and outs of the game until you feel comfortable enough to join the ladder queue with 40 tactical cards of your choice. As of right now, there is only a ranked queue however the kind and active devs have hinted towards an unranked queue once the community has grown larger.However if you are looking to play a raw, bare boned game, then you can enter the gauntlet. The Gauntlet lets you choose 1 out of 3 cards randomly given to you until you have a complete 30 card deck. Gauntlet allows for amazing combos and unique gameplay situations that leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction if you win 12/0 in a gauntlet run, or even a 0/3 gauntlet run. Duelyst has a EXTREMELY nice community that loves to interact with each other through discord, twitch, twitter and other media outlets. Tournaments are constantly being organized and supported by the developers and community members hand and hand.  I have never seen a dev team so connected that they willingly have one on one chats with the members.I was accepted into the beta of this game in June of 2015. I hated turn-based games and I REALLY hated collectable card games. However, I promise you. You will not be disappointed with this game. If you see this game as ""another bad Heartstone clone,"" I challenge you to play 3 games and tell me that this is a bad tactical game. Not only is the gameplay amazing, but Duelyst has the most beautiful pixel art you have ever seen. Some people may see this as a negative, but some people are stupid and wrong.Protip: Craft 3 Dancing Blades, 3 Primus Fists, and 3 Blaze Hounds to start your collection, and don’t disenchant anything. Build a collection, don’t try to specialize right away! "

												I will review an aspect of Duelyst that apparently has not been issued with enough depth in other reviews . For now I will not rate tha game itself - you have hundreds of other reviews explaining how the game works. I am reviewing the COSTS of this game as Duelyst caught my interest very quickly and I bought cards very fast too , making me aware of something I felt I needed to let other people interested in the game know. Apparently a lot of people get upset by free2play games being ""pay2win"" . free2play means you can play and enjoy the game for free. Now if a game is all based on a PvP rank system, it is just obvious that at some point you will have to spend money - or you won't have the required tools to allow you to compete on an equal basis ( unless of course youre extremely talented etc but this review is aimed at normal/average players ). Also , if the game is good I don't see why not spend some money on it ( even if very  little ) since people (  devs )  worked and keep working hard to develop it. Now let's take a closer look at how this plays out in Duelyst. Aside from a very small amount of solo tutorial / challenge missions there are ONLY ranked matches available. The ranking system is pretty similar to a lot of other games. Each win earns you a star / point , with winning streaks getting you an extra one. You start at rank 30 - Bronze League, which decreases initially by 1 every two starts / points .  When you reach Rank 20 , you are promoted to the Silver League - and won't fall back to Bronze not maatter how much you loose until the end of the season ( end of the month ).  Considering the winning streaks bonuses, you could reach Silver in like 18 matches. What happens when you hit Silver League ? You start running into better players with much better decks than Bronze, and it will be way harder to win if you only have a basic set of cards. With the need to purchase cards ( unless you do months of grinding ) and not being able to rank down , the game becomes effectively ""PAY2PLAY"" IMO. You either grind your way painfully and slowly with daily quests that do not require wins,  or you NEED to buy cards . Ok , pay2win is fine, but PAY2PLAY is the opposite of free2play. But let's suppose you are skilled and don't need to spend a single buck in the game. You can hit the top ranks without spending a single dollar. But you are a collector and want all the cards or just want to support the game developent buy buying all of them. Pretty muc the same as buying a game with all the DLCs.What if I tell you that after spending a little over USD300,00 ( that's correct three hundred dollars ) you will still not be able to have all the cards ( you can have a maximum of 3 copies per deck , but I am talking about not having a single copy of some of the rarer cards ) of the game? How does that sound? I definitively CANNOT RECOMMEND a game that so far has only 3 expansions and already requires you to spend like USD 500,00 to have all the cards.			"

												This is a cardgame with a strategic grid (5x9 cells). The game has 6 different factions each with a nicely varied gameplay and each faction has 2 heroes with a unique skill.Pros:-Strategic grid (5x9 cells)-Nicely aesthetic artstyle combines with pixelart for the units-Nice Gui-Ability to destroy cards and craft them like in Hearthstone (and looking at costs it also seems cheaper)-varied playstyle from the different factions AND even from the different heroes(2 each) inside the   factions-Has a replay function for your matches-Has an easy button to spectate high ranking matches so u can watch and learn better (i really wonder  why blizzard doesnt have this)-easy daily quests (for example u do NOT need to win the online matches. You only have to do some to finish the quest. The outcome doesnt matter so this makes it easy for beginners to finish the quests and gain the daily gold).-The RNG is lower than in other cardgames because of the grid and the ability to replace one card each turn.-Lots of the aoe is conditional meaning it depends on something (like for example minion power/position on the grid(on your side or not for example/adjecent or not/in column)-Orbs which are like booster packs have a higher rarity rate than if u compare it with hearthstoneThe F2P aspect seems good. I did not invest anything and I started playing one day after this game released here ( 3days of playing with 22 hours gametime) and already managed to climb up to rank 10 which is the gold rank. Orbs which are like boosters cost 100gold.In the beginning u can easily do all the challenges which are like one turn puzzles and give a nice one time boost of gold. There are also some other one time stuffs like achievments and of course for adding a referal before you do your first rank match gives u enough gold for one orb.As a normal gold income you get 2 daily quests which each atleast give 25 gold and your first daily win gives 20 gold. You also get a daily challenge puzzle which can be solved for an easy 5 gold. After this every 2nd online win gives u 15 gold (till some cap and then it lowers to just 5 gold).The game also has a drafting mode which is called gauntlet and can be compared with hearthstone arena. Like in hearthstone if u are good enough u can go infinite there.Like in heartstone there also seems to be a monthly reward chest which rewards depend on your online ranking.Cons:-No guildsystem ingame-Some ppl might not like the combination of pixel art with a different stylised artstyle-No openchat systemSo all in all the game is worth a tryout and looks like a nice alternative to hearthstone or other cardgames. The grid gives this cardgame a nice strategic placement depth.If you want to start and tryout the game and need a referal code here is mine:nyaamosYou can put this code in 3 places. Of course this can only be done once for every account and has to be done BEFORE the first rank match.    During signup.    In the settings under “Redeem referral/gift code”.    In the buddy list.My referal code:nyaamos			"

												It rewards forward thinking, board control and positioning and lacks a lot of RNG elements. Think of it as a more competitive and strategic Hearthstone.I like how beginner friendly the game is with a ton of early gold, decent enough starter decks with each faction, and the lethal challenges the game has actually make you think (unlike Kharazan...).It's just fun and doesnt feel like a grind.

												I really like the style of Duelyst. I love the pixel art and the sound, the entire package just seems really well put together in my opinion. Gameplay consists of picking your faction and using your deck of units, spells and items in an arena. The goal being to defeat the enemy general. As of this Steam release there are six factions and a pretty good variety of ""cards"" to collect (cards being units, items, and spells).Now I am no expert one way or another but one of the big complaints I am seeing pop up here and there are calls for more balance. I don't know where I fall in that argument because I have only played a few hours, but I can say I feel like one or two of the factions has the upper hand as it stands now. I do not know if it evens out at higher level play, and we are all making newbie mistakes or if there really is a balance issue with the factions. What I can do however is recommend you try them all to see for your self what you will be most comfortable playing. I would recommend Duelyst to card game and strategy fans. Its pretty neat.			"

Many would say this is a card game. I disagree somewhat because this game is so much more than that.Duelyst is an online 1v1 strategy battle game which is extremely fun, addictive & mentally challenging! Pros: -Fun bugless online experience (This gets my thumbs up as the best game of its genre)-User Interface is solid and works exactly as it should-Fun interactive system for players-Creatures and spells are funCons:*-Unit graphics are pixel art which means that the battle is not visually attractive.(If the game developers make the graphics crisp and clear, this would easily make me want to play for much longer)*-Animations in general can be improved so that the game looks more smooth and cheerful-I feel like gold rewards for some quests are too low (The effort reward ratio is not rewarding enough)-Friends can be added but no notes can be taken down so it can be hard to remember everyoneThank you Counterplay Games for a very solid and fun experience but if you can improve on my cons (the creature graphics in particular and its animations), you will have a true masterpiece of a game!

												It's a really fun game, but not really viable to play for free once you get silver ranking and start getting slapped around by players with much much better cards.  If you stick with it and play the long game grinding out gold, it may be viable to create a competitive deck. More realistically you are either going to get bored or pay up.Seems unfair to rate a 'f2p' game because of it's pay model, but if the 'pay options' give the payers a considerable advantage against the free players, the game has cancer. Gameplay wise the game is actually really well made and fun to play, and cost wise the random card packs are comparitively cheap compared to some games. So if you go in expecting to drop money to be able to compete it's not a bad game. Games that do F2P right- Path of Exile- League of Legends- DOTA 2- Team FortressMaybe a couple others?Point being monitary interaction should be based on cosmetics or advantages that could almost be considered trivial.  This is not that. I'm going to keep playing for awhile, Because it really is that fun, but if I find that I'm not able to create a fairly viable deck without investing money I'll inevitably give it up and play something else.

												So I played Duelyst fairly early on in its inception. It was a godsend to me. It combines the tactical side of an actual grid/board game with generals and collectible cards. I started playing ranked competetively when the most broken thing was Song'Hai Lantern Fox OTKs. Ive only reached S-rank once using the top tier Spell Hai lists going around at that time. A deck that actually rewarded skill and resource management and ♥♥♥♥ing tactical gameplay (who wouldve thought). After that the game started changing dramatically. The powercreep was extremely obvious and way over the top. They added super RNG pets with either under costed stats or broken abilities. What the ♥♥♥♥ are pets??? Why?? The alternate heroes they added were cool as they all seemed to be the control counterpart of the original general. But, once the meta became more established the meta just seemed to brim with dump your hand, hope they dont kill your combo pieces to race to your win condition or smack your oppenent in the face to win. There was no thinking anymore. I stopped playing when Magmar was just running everybody down with face damage while still drawing their deck. That expansion made no ♥♥♥♥ing sense to me. This game could've been so much more, but Im not sure what happaned to it.			"

												Quick Review:Absolutely fantastic. The ""card packs"" are extremely fair and often give higher rarity ""cards"". From the very beginning you can have a viable deck to use and earning gold for more is really fast with dailies and challenges among other things.The best TCG I've ever played and I've tried all the major ones digital and otherwise. I've easily played 40+ hours of this off steam as well.It doesn't take long to get a decent deck and you don't have to spend money either. I have supported them though because I feel they deserve it.You can use my username for a referral too if you want an extra 100 starting gold for a spirit orb (pack) or gauntlet ticket when you can get those.

It isn't. The cards you get early on are very potent and the legendaries you get later on are mainly fun to use.Fun Facts about the game: Some of the practice games to get you prepped for Rankings and Gaunlet was created by the community. If you get a chance to play in one of the official tournements, you may be able to get a card named after you pending on how well you get. Ex Mogwai, Panddo, Shiro the puppydragon (Named after Kibler's puppy.) and Envybaer. -Now then if you are reading this before actually trying the game you can use ""remnant89110"" as your referral and receive 1 Spirit Pack.

												Like most of these early reviews, I've been playing the game for a lot longer than it's been released on Steam.Duelyst is an absolute joy. It's a dynamic system that brings chess and card games into a glorious blend of strategy. The devs stay on top of things and while it will always have the same balance issues of any complex multiplayer game the meta changes constantly which makes the game feel different month to month as new cards are released and new combinations are found. This isn't a game to let fall by the wayside, end your Hearthstone addiction and come take part in something fresh and engaging.			"

												Disregard the 20 minutes played (at the time of writing) I've been at this for several months prior to its steam launch.I can't praise Duelyst enough. It's the perfect mix of digital CCG and tactical turn based combat that manages to bring fresh life to both the genres. One of the most refreshing parts of Counter Play's entry to an increasingly crowded digital CCG market is how easy and fair it feels to be a F2P player. Quest rewards are generous and orbs (Duelyst's card packs) frequently dole out high rarity cards, especially when compared to Hearthstone's Psudo-RNG pack opening that requires you to open LOTS of packs before the odds eventually weight in your favor and you crack an epic/legendary.The game play itself is nothing to scoff at either. Each of the 6 factions boasts 2 generals, each with a unique Bloodborne Spell (think Hearthstone Hero Power) that greatly changes how you would go about building a deck for them. Matches are generally quick, but mindless aggression and ""SMORC"" (to borrow a Hearthstone term) decks won't get you far. Duelyst matches generally boil down to a desperate struggle between two armies for control of the battlefield via clever troop movement and spells. Sucuessful decks generally live somewhere between the extremes of traditional CCG 'agro' and 'control' archtypes but there's still a fair bit of latitude when it comes to picking a strategy of choice for your favorite faction. That said, a rather limited card pool can make a lot of decks feel rather samey as a lot of the really high quality neutral minions get recycled over and over. Hopefully the upcoming Denizens of Shim'zar expansion (out in a week!) will fix a lot of those issues.And on top of all this, the soundtrack is suprisingly pumping for a turn based game, the pixel art is beautiful, and the whole experience just oozes polish and care. Each faction has a strong visual identity and it's very tempting to pick your neutral minions based as much on their visual cohesion as their tactical value! There might be some growing pains as MTG, Hearthstone, and other CCG veterans get used to the tactical board, but overall it's a massively rewarding experience that I HIGHLY recommend.			"

												What to say about Duelyst. I have been playing for 7 months now and it still excites and entertains. The game is a CCG not unlike hearthstone, but the tactical element of the board makes it so much more interesting. If you are a fan of tactics games or card games it's definitely worth checking out.Card acquisition in these game is really quite reasonable. You get gold for doing quests, most of which ask you to play with a faction for 4 games or to kill x enemy units/do x damage. There are also daily challenges for 5 gold, and if you ever miss your quests they give a small amount of the gold into a welcome back quest to make up for it. If you do all your quests, you can easily open a pack a day for about 30-40 minutes of playing. The rarities of the cards in the pack are also pretty good with a legendary card in about 1 in 4 packs. Finally, once you know the game well you can do the gauntlet, a draft mode, and so long as you get 7 wins you can go infinite for tons of rewards.The devs are a small team that are very dedicated to their game and to the community. They push out an update with 4 new cards at the end of every month and they are constantly adding new things like cosmetics. They are supporting player run tournaments which can then feed in to their qualifiers for the Duelyst world championship. As for the relation with the community, they have done multiple rountables with popular streamers and prominent members of the community have been made into cards in the game.All in all Duelyst is one of the best CCGs out there. Whether you are looking for a fun card game to play in between classes or looking to compete with the best in weekly tournaments there is a place for you here. If you are looking for community interaction, the subreddit and the discord channel are where most people go and the devs are requlars in the discord channel as well. Here's hoping I see you on the battlefield.			"

Lots of cards each faction has it's own playstyle and the graphics are beutiful.I do think the mystery crates are a tad expensive but what free game has cheap cosmetic stuff yep none I can think off haha.One last thing it works fine on browser so it is my go to game when I am on breaks n stuff. give it a go.I have been playing since openbeta on and off and I am happy it made the jump to steam for more exposure one of the better card games on here.:)			"

												As a longtime fan of Magic (and TCG in general!) and a longtime fan of Heroes of Might and magic, this game provides a fun blend between the two.  As someone who has always enjoyed digital TCG but never enjoyed Hearthstone, I've been looking for something that meets in the middle (that isn't something like MTGO - if I play something like that I might as well buy the physical cards).I really enjoy the art, the music, and the extremely fun gameplay. The concept behind the different classes is easy to master, but like all TCG the actual mastery of the game tends to be much harder.I really hope the new content will be available to win via F2P routes.

												Good tactical card game where positioning slightly different can lead to huge differences. These small things make Duelyst a game with a higher learning curve than most games and feels rewarding. Devs are cool people and it's rare to have such engagement with the creators of a game.Only thing wrong with this game is that Gauntlet is too good and it gives out too much stuff at high wins (maybe ~20% chance to get a legendary at 12 wins).Gauntlet still not nerfed FeelsBadManBTW I play on the launcher version on my windows desktop which feels more smooth to me.

												Duelyst is one of the best-designed games that I've played, and definitely the best card game.  The mixture of tactical depth and near-perfect balance among cards and factions is so satisfying, and I'm comparing to beautifully balanced games like Starcraft and DOTA.Pros:- The replace mechanic is amazing.  This is something that other card games are sorely lacking.  It gives you the option to replace one card in your hand each turn, which adds a lot to the skill ceiling and improves consistency of decks when players replace intelligently.- Game is on a grid so positioning matters.  I just hit S-rank for the first time (equivalent of ""Legend"" in Hearthstone) and I still feel like I make positioning errors in most games.  There is so much depth added from this; it is wonderful.- Counterplay Games is very proactive about balance.  If they feel that a card is too strong or weak, they change it quickly and re-evaluate.  This iterative approach is MUCH better than say, Hearthstone, where the devs refuse to change obviously broken cards for months until the screaming of anguished ladder players can be heard at Blizzard HQ.- The factions are unique and have interesting mechanics that reward good planning and decision making.  The asymmetric balance approach reminds me a lot of Starcraft, another beautiful strategy game (though obviously an RTS and not a card game).- The reward system (quests) are very generous (more than Hearthstone).  Epic/legendary drops are much more common even accounting for Duelyst allowing you to have 3x of each per deck.- Games are short and intense.- Client is well designed software-wise (netcode is good, very few crashes or surprise disconnections, client is highly responsive even on my $500 budget PC)- The tutorial system and solo challenges are great - my only complaint is that there aren't more challenges (I am spoiled)- They introduced weekly boss battles vs. AI which are lots of fun, and give a small free reward with an optional $5 larger paid reward.  This is Counterplay Games' way of covering continuing costs I believe; it's optional and you get to fight the boss either way, so I like the model.Cons:- Some people don't like the pixel art (though I personally like it)- A large portion, though not all, of the top-tier decks require quite a few epic and legendary cards.  HOWEVER, I personally hit Diamond in the first season (month) with a budget deck, and S-rank in second season after spending only $60.  I would hardly call that experience ""pay to win""; just be aware that you won't be able to play some of the top-tier netdecks in your first month or two unless you are willing to pay some money (and a couple specific decks are very expensive, though most expensive != best).  Personally I thought $60 for this game was reasonable.- The daily quests do take a decent chunk of time to complete (at least 45 minutes for me)- There are microtransactions for cosmetics and weekly value offers and stuff like that.  None of it is required at all, but the very concept makes some people angry, so beware if you are one of those people.			"

Posted: February 14
												I played the game through the Duelyst Launcher since its inital release and there's two aspects that is important to note:The GAME is possibly one of the best games I have ever played! But the developers, buisness model and new player experience is horrendous!I will state three things to back up this claim of mine:1. When Duelyst launched the game had a good deal where you paid like 7.50€ for 15 packs or more or something like that and it was a good deal at the time but... a few months later they had an event in which you could get something like 20 free packs! Amazing right?Well... it was time based. And not that it was for a limited amount of time but if your account was older than a month I believe it was, then you weren't eligable for these packs. To summarize it in a very clear cut way: it was more economically viable for you to just ignore your old account if you didn't have many cards on it or had put it down for an extended period of time after you had bought the release-bundle or just didn't play much on the account and didn't have it. It made more sense to ignore your account and make a new one.This alongside the absolutely insanely noob unfriendly quest system and that if you do well at a certain rank you can get locked to either Silver, Gold or Platinum rank and... Noobs belong in Bronze and Silver. Good players who have so called 'Battle Ribbons' that showcase they have won 100 ranked games with a faction show up in Gold. And usually you see people with 5-10 Ribbons if not even more at Gold. Where as you might see ONE Player with ONE Ribbon in Silver.You can get locked to gold and have to battle with these players and to complete a quest you need to do the following:a) Play a set number of minionsb) Play a set number of cards (yes, these two are different)c) Play a set number of turns into the game (conceding or taking lethal damage does not lower this requirement)Basically this means that if you are a new player or someone who just simply is not good enough ... in order to build a collection you have to be willing to just get slugged and unrelentlessly beaten down by people that just JUMP in terms of skill by a SIGNIFICANT margin!(Also you get gold after every win and every 3 win you get more gold but once again, you need to win to get this or be prepared to be beaten into a pulp if you are trying to complete quests.)2. Duelyst makes good use of that its a digital cardgame when dealing with mechanics and in-game by allowing you to essentially conjure up cards by having interesting effects that just add cards to your hand.However... from the buisness side, it is NOT understanding of the digital implications of a modern video game because the pricing of the individual packs (not gold price but that's already horrendous to try to get any amount of as I pointed out already) is insanely high! Since you need a playset of 3 cards of basically most cards in the game, you need to get a HUGE amount of cards! And the prices in regards to paying with actual money as opposed to gold is insanely high when you consider how many packs of cards you need to get from the base set and the expansion!If you are good at the Gauntlet you can mitigate some of these issues but... I will go into why this is not really the case because...3. The developers haven't made a casual mode or non-ranked place to play.Its either the Gauntlet or Ranked Ladder in regards to where you can play and complete quests. The gauntlet functions much like the same when compared to Hearthstone but ... the gold is once again, annoying beyond belief to get ANY amount of!And since there's no casual mode where non-competitive decks exists, you consistently have to try to complete the quests whilst playing against people with litterally thousands of games played, near complete if not complete collections of cards and since the playerbase is still relatively small for the game you basically ONLY encounter excellent-to-amazingly good players once you have gotten past Silver which can happen by mistake and you are now stuck in Gold.The game itself is AMAZING! So if you can get past that the buisness model is that of a regular cardgame in a digital format, that the developers genuinely do try to scam their players' accounts and the most horrendous F2P-system bar that of something like Magic Duels. Its not a Mobile-Phone level of ""F2P""-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it is certainly horrendous and really, REALLY annoying for folks that doesn't want to put in 40-50€ into the game to even just get STARTED.I recommend the game if you are like me and have a cardgame-itch you need to scratch and you want another option than Hearthstone. But to anyone else who's basically not a cardgame-addict... AVOID THIS GAME!!!Oh and a few more things since I am posting this review only here on Steam:1. The fanbase is rabidly trying to defend the game because they are no longer victims of the horrendous new-player experience this game offers.2. The Steam version doesn't seem to have a working Steam-Overlay system so what's even the point of having it on Steam I don't know.3. It got essentially CS:GO lootboxes in the game so... yah', it tries to scam you in that regard as well being a Gambling-Simulator.4. Both Steam and non-Steam versions of the game can crash or just freeze up if you try to look through your collection quickly if you play in Windowed mode.5. The best way to summarize the community when asking for help is ""I don't believe you"" if you are experiencing something other angelic song when playing the game (they don't deal well with neither reality NOR with critique).

												Duelyst is one of the few games ive played that involve a ranking system that allows you to play mainly off of skill rather than card power. Now this idea may be argued by people but from my experiance so far i have found that when playing you are easily able to progress and gain more gold for card packs. And due to this i have often been able to keep up with the power lvl of cards as i increased in rank. Duelyst has what hearthstone used to, reliance on skill. Thats Why im loving this game.			"

												This is a really neat strategy game.Yes, it has cards and decks, and they do add some randomness to it. However, I see it more as a turn-based strategy game using cards to add randomness. And for those who don't tend to like card games because they find the RNG frustrating, this game helps mitigate the RNG (mitigate, not eliminate) by allowing you to trade out one card per turn.The board and units' placements upon it make it much more complicated than something like Hearthstone, or even Faeria, another turn based strategy game with card stuff going on. I'd actually place Faeria closer to Hearthstone and other CCGs than Duelyst is, by a pretty solid margin.			"

												Duelyst is a great game at times. Often it is a a chore cuz it forces you to play pvp no matter what. There are no big alternatives. Sooner or later you finished solo challenges and you will have not much options left to farm and enjoy the game in Pve aspects.Solo challenges are less rewarding the harder it gets. Why? Dont ask me.Lets talk about Gauntlet. Okay lets dont. Gauntlet is a chore. Still and since Beta.Boss encounters: After you managed to beat him you can get a single orb and 3 orbs you have to open with a pay and win key. Its not totally unfair but it feels false.Dont get me wrong. Races and diversity of cards are great. I even like the look of it. But... Duelyst is like a Topmodel. It looks amazing but after the date you want to meet a real Lady.^^All in all Duelyst is a mixed bag and the reason I cant recommend it is cuz the game has not developed very far since Beta. Sure there are some more ""card-editions,"" (Tools to earn more money) But gamemodes? No!This could be so much more. Playing it I often thought about maybe to give Kings and Legends another try and that is no good sign at all.			"

												Epic and legendary cards have become more difficult to obtain after each update, seems it was just a marketing strategy to expand their player base and gain popularity quicker. Hence, it becomes more of a P2W game, because most of the rarer cards have stronger effects.2017/1/1Recent updates have been backing up my assumption, drop rates of legendaries have become relatively low in comparison to the previous patches.I'm done with this game, its pay model is becoming quite analogous to Hearthstone's, don't want to become a cash cow.Maybe I should quit playing any other upcoming F2P games as well, I'll just stick to playing Chess, Go and the Rubik's cube from now on.

												Not only one of the best free to play games on steam but probably one of the best games on steam all together. Incredibly deep yet incredibly simple turn based strategy game. Alot of people will try to compare this to hearthstone and they would he right to. Their are alot of similarities. How ever, using a grid system instead of 2 sides of a board to place your cards adds an unrivalled level of depth.The way they have balanced the cards has created a system where there is multiple win conditions, and multiple ways to achieve each win condition.Every faction (class) has 2 generals with different bloodline spells (your classes  spell) creating multiple play styles for each faction. Yet some how they have managed to get every playstyle for every faction to feel unique and compliment the lore and look of the faction. The ladders seasons reset at the end of every month giving substantial rewards, and the game seems to be very generous in terms of card packs, gold and spirit (dust) rewards. Because of these things, strategy plays a much more important role then draw or calibre of deck. Almost every game is challenging and rewarding. And unlike hearthstone where it was easy to play ""optimally"" and lost to either bad card draws or better decks, in Duelyst, every game I lose is because I make mistakes. And whats incredible is how often you can make mistakes and how you can actively see then cost you every game. TLDR; Incredible game, And there is no reason not to try it.			"

												Where to begin? Here's another free-to-play game where purchases really aren't required, has addicting gameplay, solid design, and a competitive scene. The comparisons to Hearthstone are accurate, since it borrows most (if not all or more) of the same card mechanics that HS borrowed from MTG to begin with. If you're familiar with either of those games, you'll get the lay of the land pretty quick.But what's this? A positioning mechanic? This adds a whole new layer to your strategic thought. Also, you can replace a card once per turn (or twice with certain card effects), which is a big upgrade from Hearthstone where you can get locked very easily with your high-cost draws and can't do anything but use your hero power for a couple turns.PROS:* Highly strategic gameplay, with the CCG and tabletop elements blending seamlessly.* The tutorial and challenges are well-designed for familiarizing you with the mechanics. Daily challenges require a lot of meta-thinking. * For a free game there's surprisingly little pressure to buy any microtransactions unless you're really trying to get in on the competitive scene, or you just want that badass skin for your favorite general. You can get card packs just through playing relatively easily. Everything else in the cash shop is purely cosmetic: emotes, profile icons, card backs, and general skins, which admittedly are fairly cheap and look pretty cool. You can also grind the ""spirit"" currency you get from disenchanting cards, but that's a long road for little gain.* For low-bit pixelated graphics, everything's animated well.* Having the option to replace a card each turn with no penalties attached alleviates some of the inherent frustration in CCGs of getting an unfavorable draw.* Uniquely diverse deck generals, but only six base decks to choose from. On the upside, each deck has a second general you can unlock by leveling it up, though the only real difference between generals is their personal spell. Still, used wisely it could massively affect your card synergy.* The main menu has a direct link to all the currently active livestreams, as well as a plethora of replays, sorted by player rank. Pretty neat way to go about including a spectator mode.* There's an entire ""Codex"" accessible from the main menu that has lore on the characters, races and timeline of this game's universe, complete with narration and artwork. Not that there's much reason to be emotionally invested, but if you're into that sort of thing, it's there. Definitely shows a lot of heart on the developers' side, very nice touch.* Tons of default emotes to use in a match, and even more to buy/unlock. They even added replies from AI opponents when, say, you foil their next move, or if they think they've got the edge on you. Kinda cute.NEUTRAL:* With the amount of writing they put into a codex, you'd think they'd have included flavor text for the cards, even if it's just a blurb. Oh well. It's better than seeing those tongue-in-cheek one-liners in Hearthstone. (Looking especially at you, Nozdormu.)Can't really think of any cons; there may be some balance issues between the base decks that I'm not keen on, but it's a solid game overall, and you can't complain with free.

												I was first introduced to Duelyst during its kickstarter campaign through another kickstarter success story's community forum.  It looked beautiful and seemed like a fun concept.  I didn't decide to back it at the time and instead promptly forgot about it.I was later reintroduced to Duelyst via a friend who DID back it, letting me know that it's been released for a bit now and that it was free to play.  This was in late January, during the open beta.  Hearing ""free to play"" triggered worries about what sort of exploitative ftp cash grab gimmicks that might have been implemented, but found it to be entirely devoid of impulse buy exploitation.  With a big sigh of relief, I dove right in and was able to enjoy the game whole-heartedly.Then, as I raised up through the ranks and came to realize just how narrow the meta really was in high level play, a ray of light pierced through to the core of the game and changed everything.  The developers recognized that one of their core mechanics was limiting high level play in a major way (drawing 2 cards per turn forced a need to play 2 cards per turn) and they COMPLETELY REWORKED that core system, changing everything about the pacing of the game.  It really caught me off guard at first, but within a week I realized how much of an amazing thing they had just done.It's now been a half year that I've been playing this game.  As a result of their show of forethought and willingness to adapt even the core systems to keep the game healthy and active, I have a lot of faith that Counterplay will keep Duelyst a game to enjoy for years to come.  It's astoundingly easy to build cards up without spending a dime, essentially getting a booster pack per day within 4-8 games; and with such quick matches, it's easy to enjoy the game in short bursts or longer sessions alike.  If you like tactical gameplay, creative deckbuilding, or even just get a boner over amazing animations like I do, <b>play the game</b>.			"

												What intrigued me the most is the art & music obviously. I'm a sucker for pixel art that's been done well. Reminded me a bit of Hyper Light Drifter's style.After playing through the tutorial (which was really well done by the way) I did a few online matches. Everything has been really well explained for a newbie to the game, but fun to master as one familiar with the idea behind gameplay.Playing online really showed me a lot of different tactics that other players have been using (I'm now Silver tier!). It's also very friendly as far as ranking is considered. I don't think you can rank down? You're just required to win a certain number of times to go up in the ranks.Even if you don't play online, there's a handful of challenges that are really good puzzles and even some very challenging Dailies that are fun to go at!I haven't spent a cent on the game yet and I still feel like I'm having an unhindered experience. This is awesome for a f2p TCG.One thing I don't quite understand yet is how crafting works. Maybe there's some tutorial I haven't looked at just yet.

												I was skeptical when I first saw this game. Pixilated graphics that whole tactics thing gave me a horrible vibe of seeing browser MMO's. The only thing that got me actually downloading the game was the score, im those guys who look at the ""Positive"" ""Meta Critic"" which gave a really high score, and the community's comments. Sad I know. Then it comes to actually playing it, alright I can handle pixilated graphics, oh whats this? The ""cards"" come to life as u highlight them? COOL! Alright, lemme go through tutorial. Alright, easy enough. As expected more than just the knight character you play as, there are several other characters to choose from. Like Hearthstone or Chronicles you have to beat the hero to play them. Alright, first contendor, the ice ♥♥♥♥♥. Cool i unlocked the ice ♥♥♥♥♥. Alright, I wanna do some PVP, ill have to go through some of the solo games. Cool, i unlock PVP. Alright lets build a deck, alright lets test it against other people...(Didnt test it against AI) Alright, i won against the first guy. Hmm complete a daily challenge, (Spends like half an hour figuring how to complete the challenge, gives up) continues pvp. Wins with ice ♥♥♥♥♥ and onnly ice ♥♥♥♥♥ 7 games won without a single loss. To sum it all up, this game is great. Now i can add this game to playing TCG such as ""Hearthstone"" ""Chronicles of Runescape"" and ""Elder Scrolls Legends"" (is not in steam).

												Basically Hearthstone combined with the combat of the Banner Saga. That alone puts it above Hearthstone in my opinion. I love it and have played it for over 7 hours in the day I bought it. It's free to play, and you still get a deent amount of gold to buy packs with and the starting cards for each faction aren't terrible and unable to win ranked games like in Hearthstone. Overall, I strongly recommend it and have transitioned to it from Hearthstone.			"

												Where to begin? Here's another free-to-play game where purchases really aren't required, has addicting gameplay, solid design, and a competitive scene. The comparisons to Hearthstone are accurate, since it borrows most (if not all or more) of the same card mechanics that HS borrowed from MTG to begin with. If you're familiar with either of those games, you'll get the lay of the land pretty quick.But what's this? A positioning mechanic? This adds a whole new layer to your strategic thought. Also, you can replace a card once per turn (or twice with certain card effects), which is a big upgrade from Hearthstone where you can get locked very easily with your high-cost draws and can't do anything but use your hero power for a couple turns.PROS:* Highly strategic gameplay, with the CCG and tabletop elements blending seamlessly.* The tutorial and challenges are well-designed for familiarizing you with the mechanics. Daily challenges require a lot of meta-thinking. * For a free game there's surprisingly little pressure to buy any microtransactions unless you're really trying to get in on the competitive scene, or you just want that badass skin for your favorite general. You can get card packs just through playing relatively easily. Everything else in the cash shop is purely cosmetic: emotes, profile icons, card backs, and general skins, which admittedly are fairly cheap and look pretty cool. You can also grind the ""spirit"" currency you get from disenchanting cards, but that's a long road for little gain.* For low-bit pixelated graphics, everything's animated well.* Having the option to replace a card each turn with no penalties attached alleviates some of the inherent frustration in CCGs of getting an unfavorable draw.* Uniquely diverse deck generals, but only six base decks to choose from. On the upside, each deck has a second general you can unlock by leveling it up, though the only real difference between generals is their personal spell. Still, used wisely it could massively affect your card synergy.* The main menu has a direct link to all the currently active livestreams, as well as a plethora of replays, sorted by player rank. Pretty neat way to go about including a spectator mode.* There's an entire ""Codex"" accessible from the main menu that has lore on the characters, races and timeline of this game's universe, complete with narration and artwork. Not that there's much reason to be emotionally invested, but if you're into that sort of thing, it's there. Definitely shows a lot of heart on the developers' side, very nice touch.* Tons of default emotes to use in a match, and even more to buy/unlock. They even added replies from AI opponents when, say, you foil their next move, or if they think they've got the edge on you. Kinda cute.NEUTRAL:* With the amount of writing they put into a codex, you'd think they'd have included flavor text for the cards, even if it's just a blurb. Oh well. It's better than seeing those tongue-in-cheek one-liners in Hearthstone. (Looking especially at you, Nozdormu.)Can't really think of any cons; there may be some balance issues between the base decks that I'm not keen on, but it's a solid game overall, and you can't complain with free.

												Amazing  mix between a Collectible Card Game and a Turn Based Strategy game. Unlike a CCG like Hearthstone or MTG, fighting will take place in a grid, where you can use your cards to summon minions, cast spells and equip items which you will use to defeat the enemy general while keeping yours alive, just don't forget that generals can be as powerful as your best cards. Therefore, good positioning is extremely important to make the most of your resources. Unlike other CCGs you actually need to move your 10/10 next to the enemy general to deal damage, and there are plenty of ways to stop it from doing that. Combat is just great. Matches are relatively quick, maybe 10 minutes max. but they are action packed and with plenty of surprises. You might be completely surrounded by buffed enemies, the enemy General expecting you to concede, but then you draw a card that temporarily transforms al your enemiesl to tiny 1/1s, allowing your otherwise weaker creatures to turn the tide of battle. It's hard to know whether you're winning or losing, since, with good luck and good timing, the match could easily turn around. And then turn around again...Duelyst boasts of 6 different factions with their own unique cards (as well as neutral cards for all factions), each with two different generals, and each general with its own unique and powerful skill. This allows for lots of different decks and playstyles. However, starter decks are powerful and good enough to win even vs opponents with a bigger card variety, as skill is more relevant than the cards you have. The game itself is very newbie friendly while still having great depth and being hard to master. You can also play practice games and challenges to learn the game's mechanics and hone your skillsThe aesthetic of the game is gorgeous. Each creature and spell is beautifully animated in pixel art. It also has a great soundtrack.Duelyst is a true F2P game with a fair business model. You can unlock new card packs (5 cards each with at least one rare) either by paying real money or by using gold. Each pack costs 100 gold, and you can very easily earn it by completing daily quests, challenges, or simply by winning up to x amount of matches every day. You can also buy cosmetics like card backs, emotes and profile pictures with real money.If you want to check out the game, feel free to use my referral code: WaelderYou'll get 100 gold for using it, which is enough for an extra card pack, and I'll get a card pack if you progress enough in ranked.

												Very fun TCG/Turn-Based-Strategy game. Basically, it's a card game, except with turn-based strategy in the form of a board with movement tiles etc. I was very happy to see that the F2P elements of the game are pretty generous and that it's similar to hearthstone in terms of rewards. There are daily quests, challenges and all sorts of different activities that reward you with gold to buy packs. I've always liked TCG games like this better than the traditional because I feel like RNG is a lot less brutal. If you get a bad hand you'll be at a disadvantage, but you still have an opportunity to turn it around with clever play.I definitely see myself sinking at least 20+ hours into this game.			"

												I love this game. It's a wonderful mix of tactical turn-based maneuvering and collectible card game, where you have a steady stream of gold to buy new cards for even if you don't spend any real money.But unfortunately I experienced game-breaking bugs in September. A few turns into every match, no more moves are displayed. I've made several bug reports, without getting any response, and the issue persists on both computers (Windows and Mac) I've tried the game on.Until these issues are fixed I'll have to give it a thumbs down. I definitely don't recommend anyone to spend any money on it, because it might suddenly become permanently unplayable.			"

												Like trading card games? Like civilization or heros of might and magic? This is the game for you!pros:Smaller card pool and less powerful legendaries means it's cheaper to build a top of the line deck. Duelyst decks are also more consistent.Multiple generals means multiple play styles. It's easy to find the perfect deck for you!The positioning aspect means it's not just 'who gets the best cards.' it's 'who gets good cards and PLAYS them the best.'cons: If you want to be serious you're going to want to pay some money and buy some card packs. You can grind them up, but who wants to sit on the bottom of the ranked ladder for weeks? This is one free to play game that makes me happily open my wallet.The game has no non-ranked matchmaker, so you will have to develop a list of friends to play with to test new decks out. It's weird. Feel free to add me in game (same name as in steam here) if you want to test! You can also use my name as a referral code to get some extra gold and packs.			"

												This game has so much potential. Its F2P Model has it making me not recommend it.Great Tactics game play, even with some seriously unbalaced cards(like actually wtf were they thinking when they made some of these).It seriously is fun.For a time.However you will run into a lot of people with just plainly better decks than you. That should be fine, we'll get more cards as we play right?Wrong. You have to win 3 matches to get a ""Reward"" This can take an hour, and MAYBE you get 15gold (100 buys a card pack)This model is done in hearthstone, however;The other maybe is that you get a ""mystery crate"" which requires $$$ to open.You can play 5+ hours straight without getting any new cards. Pretty frustrating to not progress in a game after 5 hours, right?They do have a quest system where you can earn 50-70 gold a day and a larger reward for 15 quests, but that makes the game something you only want to play a couple times a day.Leaves a lot of room to be desires. Will take weeks for a F2P player to acquire a deck they like.Best for casual players who will only want to play a little each day. "

												Both Duelyst and Faeria are free to play- the question isn't one of money, but of time- something that ideally you'll on spend on the better of the two, since they're pretty similar otherwise- low hardware requirements, microtransactions, internal friendlists and pregame deckbuilding etc. It wouldn't take long for anyone to try both out, honestly- neither take very long to fully access- a couple hours at most.If you want a second opinion though, Duelyst left me with a fairly bored first impression, whilst Faeria really grabbed me with both the aesthetic, the mechanics and the tutorial. If you're looking for a FTP CCG, Duelyst, at least in my opinion, is the worse of the two. Faeria also has online singleplayer. "

												I can not in good faith reccomend this game. It's one of those f2p Card games where you have to pay real money to get the best cards. I will say that it is one of the best animated ones out there. For example when you play a card, it actually puts the unit on a grid based map and has attack animations. Very nice on that part. The strategy part of this game though is total bogus. You build a deck or use a deck made by the game depending on what faction you chose. I have put in about 80 hours and can tell you how un balanced they all are. But the main problem with the game is that every single match no matter how you build your deck with a certain playstyle in mind it is all random. Yes you can replace 2 cards befor ematch starts from your starting hand and you can replace 1 card each round - ou tof 40 cards. I fail to see how there is any strategy when your opponent can start with exactly what he/she has in mind and you start with no set up what -so -ever. In 80 hours almost every single match I have played has been over in about 7-8 rounds. it's usually just a snowball effect of who got to start with what they wanted. Now if they could fix that and you could at least pick your starting hand and leave the rest random I would keep playing. I would post this game everywhere and give it publicity to my friends and co-workers but in this current state I don't see many grown adults wasting the time to play it.			"

												Duelyst is a nice game, except that the near s-rank ladder is a bit too grindy.Duelyst is a Collectible Card Game on a 5x9 chessboard. It's similar to Hearthstone, but without the over-emphasis of RNG. Since it's on a chessboard, there are a lot of unique position-based mechanics, and that is the speciality of Duelyst. There are 6 factions/classes, and each faction has 2 generals, each with a unique Bloodborne Spell (Hero Power) which synergizes well with certain faction cards. Hence, there are at least 12 (in reality much more) playstyles and gameplans.New-player experience is okay. They are definitely more generous that Hearthstone. There are a lot of hidden ""achievement quests"" that gives you a decent amount of gold, so that you could expand your card collections quickly in the early phases.Most cards are well-designed and I seldom see cards that are outright bad (as opposed to the situation in Hearthstone). However, only a small pool of cards are used in high-ladder because those cards are simply too powerful. This case is more severe as the first expansion has rolled out - just like how Hearthstone was when Naxx and GvG came out. Quite an amount of potential deck archetypes are unviable because of the strength of some new cards. Ultimately, the game at a competitive level is grindy and somewhat stale - but I guess that happens in every CCG.The publicity department of this game is also not so good. Their outreach is bad - if you don't play the game yourself, you have nearly no channels to know that this game is holding up a promotion. If it wasn't that a friend referred you to this game, it would take a miracle for youto discover this game. It doesn't matter that they have released an expansion 2 months ago, it doesn't matter that they gave away packs to newcomers a month ago, it doesn't matter if they're planning to release another expansion in 2017 Q1 when they do nearly nothing to increase the publicity of the game and reach out to potential new players. A comparison would be Shadowverse. It's another Collectible Card Game. they paid Reynad and Kripparian to promote their new expansion.I reckon that this game's community is slowly dying as in this moment, even if the game is fun. There is nearly no one streaming this game. The relatively popular regular streamers of this game (none of them has more than 200 viewers) have recently stopped streaming as much. Forums are much quieter than anytime before (good thing is that ranting threads die as the forum is becoming less active).TL;DR: All in all, Duelyst is good and has a lot of potential. The game is fun and rewarding, and there is a lot for you to explore in this game. However, the community of Duelyst is too small and they have little, if not none, publicity and outreach, that they may not survive the other competitors, such as Hearthstone, GWENT, The Elder Scrolls: Legends, and Shadowverse. Go pay a visit if you have free time, and see you like it - they've added a lot of supports to ""casual"" players so you could expand your card collection in a good pace, even if you don't invest much time into it.

												It's great . As a player currently ranked 15/30 in Duelyst, ranked 20/25 in hearthstone as well as a dabbler in the fates series the game feels even better than hearthstone. Duelyst has less reliance on luck and more in skill since it gives players the ability to decide on the unit placement in a 9 by 5 plane. For the freedom of more choices one must be given the difficulty of more complex scenearios. While the game is not nearly as complicated as a full on strategy game such as xcom or fire emblem but it feels far more advanced and free to do what you like then hearthstone. It's better than full on strategy games in the sense that your have more choice in your units with special effects. It's better than hearthstone in the sense that you can place units in a strategically adavtagous way where even if your cards are worse you could bait your enemy into a unescapable corner then flooding the spots where he could summon minnions with yours instead giving him no place to summon minnions. As you can see I'm not that adept in the art of strategy but what I do know is that this game is great even better than hearthstone in a strategical sense. Hearthstone is so popular yet their are hardly as many duelyst players. I wondered why then I realized that it was only logical since Hearthstone beings an easier/ easy to access game to new players of course their would be more players but hearthstone is also far older. In closing if you like hearthstone you will probably like this game even more.			"

Duelyst is a highly stratiegic card collecting 1v1 summoning game where the aim is to defeat the enemy general by reducing their health from 25 to 0 without yours losing all of theirsIn Duelyst you take control of 1 of 6 factions to fight another player, choose from 12 different generals (there are two for each faction) and duke it out. Climb the season ladder to win rewards and brag about it to your friends. Suprisingly even though there has been 2.3 thousand reviews but only 400 seem to play everyday (in English time according to my English friend) and not too many more seem to play in US hours.  THIS GAME IS A DEFINITE MUST PLAY FOR CCG OR TACTIC GAMES LOVERSDuelyst has some really superb art and nice unit designs. Played Chess? Play Duelyst, its like Chess but instead has you control units who move in similar patterns with different Opening Gambits, Movement types and Dying Wishes. The game is very fun, and is like one of those 'Easy (sort of) to learn, Hard to master' games.  This game also has a lot of lore findable through the challenges chapters (once you complete one) that are put into the Codex on the main menu. NEEDS A BIGGER COMMUNITY Sadly, Duelyst has a small community and it would be amazing if you could make a good decision and get this game. Its a fun game,  this game was the first TBS game I ever invested time into and I love it "

												Duelyst is a nice game, except that the near s-rank ladder is a bit too grindy.Duelyst is a Collectible Card Game on a 5x9 chessboard. It's similar to Hearthstone, but without the over-emphasis of RNG. Since it's on a chessboard, there are a lot of unique position-based mechanics, and that is the speciality of Duelyst. There are 6 factions/classes, and each faction has 2 generals, each with a unique Bloodborne Spell (Hero Power) which synergizes well with certain faction cards. Hence, there are at least 12 (in reality much more) playstyles and gameplans.New-player experience is okay. They are definitely more generous that Hearthstone. There are a lot of hidden ""achievement quests"" that gives you a decent amount of gold, so that you could expand your card collections quickly in the early phases.Most cards are well-designed and I seldom see cards that are outright bad (as opposed to the situation in Hearthstone). However, only a small pool of cards are used in high-ladder because those cards are simply too powerful. This case is more severe as the first expansion has rolled out - just like how Hearthstone was when Naxx and GvG came out. Quite an amount of potential deck archetypes are unviable because of the strength of some new cards. Ultimately, the game at a competitive level is grindy and somewhat stale - but I guess that happens in every CCG.The publicity department of this game is also not so good. Their outreach is bad - if you don't play the game yourself, you have nearly no channels to know that this game is holding up a promotion. If it wasn't that a friend referred you to this game, it would take a miracle for youto discover this game. It doesn't matter that they have released an expansion 2 months ago, it doesn't matter that they gave away packs to newcomers a month ago, it doesn't matter if they're planning to release another expansion in 2017 Q1 when they do nearly nothing to increase the publicity of the game and reach out to potential new players. A comparison would be Shadowverse. It's another Collectible Card Game. they paid Reynad and Kripparian to promote their new expansion.I reckon that this game's community is slowly dying as in this moment, even if the game is fun. There is nearly no one streaming this game. The relatively popular regular streamers of this game (none of them has more than 200 viewers) have recently stopped streaming as much. Forums are much quieter than anytime before (good thing is that ranting threads die as the forum is becoming less active).TL;DR: All in all, Duelyst is good and has a lot of potential. The game is fun and rewarding, and there is a lot for you to explore in this game. However, the community of Duelyst is too small and they have little, if not none, publicity and outreach, that they may not survive the other competitors, such as Hearthstone, GWENT, The Elder Scrolls: Legends, and Shadowverse. Go pay a visit if you have free time, and see you like it - they've added a lot of supports to ""casual"" players so you could expand your card collection in a good pace, even if you don't invest much time into it.

												I just want to put the end result right up here for the ones that won't read big reviews(ps this is my first review):=============================================================================| Under the line you're good to go with any other free 2 play turn based card game but any other game of this || kind i have played till now won't try to take your money like the steam summer sale.                                          |=============================================================================The bad things:----------------------This game has only one thing in his mind in the background, wich is making money. As example the moment you defeat a boss you get a ""boss chest"" but the really nasty thing they are doing isthat this ""chest"" will expire after 48 hours and wan'ts you to buy a key for 4.99 €\$. It's not like the rest of the ""free to play"" games are doing it. Since in the other ones those wouldn't expire. It might be that it this game has a nice idea and gameplay but what does the nicest packaging help you if you put it arround bs.I would be completely ok if you would have to pay for extra looks like other hero styles, smileys and so on. But to be so desperate for money that you even start using the 0815 of psychic tricks, so to say put the ""customer"" under pressure.more over it's like any other card game with only one more mechanic, so why should i stay by this game if i can play just  nearly the exact same else where? That one tiny detail won't keep me playing if the devs are like that.The good things:-------------------- The Gameplay is fun- Well programmed AI- New game concept for turn based card games, wich adds more strategy into the whole thing			"

												Edit: So after a bunch of updates I can safely say I can't recommend this game to new players anymore. It's still a good game if you can get past how ♥♥♥♥ing grindy it is. First there was the nerf to the welcome back quest. Your only form of gold gain after not playing for... A SINGLE DAY. Yup, this game doesn't have quest slots like every other card game out there. You have to play every single day. Have fun wtih that! Then when the new expansion came out, they nerfed drop rates. The new orbs gave legendaries much less frequently. Obviously this is a huge deal, the game allows you to have 3 legendaries per deck... have fun collecting them all. And now, the quests are more grindy than ever and still no quest slots.Everything that I haven't crossed below still holds true, the game is still good, it's just the bussiness model that's bad but I cannot recommend it. _______________________________________________________________________________________With Elder Scrolls: Legends in open beta, Gwent just around the corner and Duelyst getting its first expansion, hearthstone FINALLY has some good competition and it was about ducking time.Yes it's a Collectible Card Game but it's like no other.I've been playing it for a few months before it came out on steam.First lets address the features of the game and I'll go into detail down below.Pros:Chess-like board that makes for very strategic gameplayExtremly F2P-friendly Not anymore it's not. Unless you have nothing else to do all day. Very good card / character designAmazing pixel art and fully animated minions and spellsEasy to learn with a very good tutorial, but hard to masterFour different modesOn-going lore which makes for an interesting readDaily challengeThey embrace the digital aspect of this game (frequent nerfs / buffs) Replay functionCons:UI could use a little workQuest system could be improved Oh they ""improved"" it by making more grindy.No casual mode as of yetNo spectate friends function Now there is!  Keep in mindDeck size is fourty cardsUp to three copies of each card including legendaries in your deckYou draw a card at the END of your turnYou can replace a card from your hand for a random one from your deck each turnWall of text:This game is like chess. The tutorial combined with the challenges are very thorough in this regard. Tutorial gives you a basic idea of how the game plays and the challenges put you in different situations that are set up for lethal. Basically designed to get you into the thought process of the game, which is something Hearthstone doesn't do (Although it's arguable that it doesn't need to, since it's much simpler). After that you can practice against the AI with your homebrewed decks honing your skills and later on you can venture on to the ranked mode or if you want the gauntlet which is identical to arena in hearthstone. You get offered to choose one of three random cards of the same rarity until you make a deck. Deck size is thirty cards in this mode.Game is pretty straight forward but really hard to master. During your first weeks you'll be making tons of misplays. Hell, I'm still making some but it's REALLY rewarding. Figuring out a way to make a comeback or putting together combos is extremely satisfying. It will make you feel GOOD. Meanwhile in hearthstone: Yes this random effect won me the game LOLZNow as I said, the game is extremely F2P-friendly. Tons of hidden one off challenges which really help you get started (rewards ranging from gold to actual legendaries). There are no ""win"" quests in this game, the game in that regard just rewards you for playing, which is something hearthstone does NOT do. The quests that give you the most gold in hearthstone require wins except a couple like watch n learn which doesn't even encourage you to play. This is SO healthy for the game, you can try whatever deck you like without feeling like you are not making progress. However for those who want to be rewarded for winning there's the first win of the day which grants 20 extra gold and you get 15 per 2 wins. Which is so much better than what hearthstone does. (10 gold per 3 wins). The end of the month chest gives you a pack as well again something hearthstone does NOT do. This all makes the game feel way less grindy in general.Moving on to the art of the game, it's simply beautiful and colorful. From the backgrounds to the pixel art of the cards. This with the wonderfuly written and narrated lore bring the game to life. I would strongly urge you to read the lore.The music isn't something to be sniffed at either, there's few but really good tracks in the game. Yes they do get repetitive but what CCG music doesn't? No game is without its faults sadly.Lets start off with the UI, it's not bad but it doesn't really suit the style of the game. It's really negligible but if you are like me, it's not going to go unnoticed and what's up with the game giving me a constant reminder in the main menu that I have unopened cosmetic chests? It makes it look ugly and its obvious its there to push you into buying cosmetics, again negligible, but still.Now onto more important things, the game doesn't have a casual mode yet. For some people it's not going to be a big deal but I know there are others out there who want to play without having to worry about their rank constantly. Here's what I would consider the biggest issue with the game however. I stressed how F2P-friendly the game is but it's not friendly towards people without loads of time. If you don't do your quests daily you don't get more, only one extra that adds 5 gold each day you haven't completed your quests and capping off at 50 gold. It's a nice gesture but you are falling behind 45~ gold per day not counting daily wins. This is something hearthstone does way better. You can always argue how we should be glad its free to play but I cannot look past this and this is coming from someone with a lot of time. Even I can see how bad this is for others. In the end though, this is the best CCG around in almost every regard. I hope this and the other CCG's get big enough because hearthstone is in dire need of competition. The game has been going downhill since the Old Gods expansion. I hope I convinced you to at least give it a try, have fun!Ps. i'll be updating the pros and cons as future updates happen.			"

												A very interesting game with all the problems of a Pay-To-Win game. Duelyst is a battle board card game where 2 players race to drop their opponent's generals hitpoints to 0. You spawn minions, cast spells and equip artifacts to try to control and/or burst the opponent to death. Conclusion, try this game, it's not bad. However, caveat emptor, do note the P2W business model. With the crafting system added in, it is possible to keep on getting repeat cards. That way they are basically selling you Spirit. Best price is $49.99 for 40 Orbs.Counterplay Games was set up by Keith Lee, Eric Lang etc01/10/16: The CONS kind of grinded me down after a while. Rare cards were easier to get before the Denizens patch but now it's kind of a negative feeling when you see Commons and repeats, so I'm taking a break from this game for now.06/12/16 : They stopped giving 100 gold per day and limited it at 90. The number of players have dwindled dramatically.01/02/17 : Boss Battles are included. Duelyst gives 1 free card just for logging in. They have a Bloodborn Orb business model. 300 gold for a Bloodborn Orb that has 3 unowned cards. It costs $2.99 per Orb and $19.99 for the whole Bloodborn set. I changed my review to ""No"". After looking at the Battle Pets, it's obvious that Duelyst has fallen into depravity and given up on the game. E.g. Slo, 0-cost 1/4 with Provoke.PROS1. Nice ArtI like the artwork a lot. Christophe Ha, former Blizzard Overwatch character concept artist, and Anton Nadeev, the environment concept artist, do pretty good work. 2. Strategic ElementPlacing your troops in different locations matter. Being 1 square away can make all the difference between losing and winning.3. Asymmetric FactionsDifferent cards, different abilities. 6 different factions, each with 2 different heroes for a total of 12 different strategies.4. PuzzlesVery fun and challenging to think about how to complete a puzzle. The daily challenge is fun to do.5. Lore on CardEach card has a tiny piece of a story. One card connects to another card. E.g. Scion's Wish to PyromancerCONS1. Pay To WinWant that specific combo deck? Pay. Best price is $49.99 for 40 Spirit Orbs. Orbs are what you call packs. Each pack has 5 ""random"" cards. 2. Repeat CardsIt is possible to get repeats in multiple packs as the solution is to disenchant them.3. Rarity CreepThe rare cards seriously have abilities that are far superior. One famous example used to be the Battle Sisters. For a low cost of 4, you could draw 2 Faction cards.https://i0.wp.com/cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/723013/16096031/09393fe4-32fc-11e6-9cb5-2e55deba1b32.jpg?ssl=1However, to get this card, you currently need to unlock 6 rares of the core set, which is really silly.4. No Trading SystemYou want that specific card? Pony up the cash. There is no way to trade that card.Have an excess card? You can't give/trade it away. It has no value except for disenchanting for crafting.5. Crafting SystemIt was recently implemented and did not exist in the alpha. If you want a card, you can grind your♥♥♥♥♥off getting enough spirit to craft that card. The cost for crafting is as follows.Common (White) - 40 SpiritRare (Blue) - 100 Spirit Epic (Purple) - 350 SpiritLegendary (Gold) - 900 Spirit5. GrindingTo get 1 Orb (1 pack of 5 ""random"" cards), you need 100 gold. It's much easier to farm than Hearthstone but it's still approximately, 1 pack per day. Normally, you would need to play at least 4 games with a specific Faction to earn 2Play 4 games with 1 Faction - 25 GoldPlay 4 games with 1 Faction - 25 GoldFirst Win of the Day - 20 GoldWelcome Back Play 3 Games - 20 GoldPuzzle Challenge - 5 Gold2 Wins Reward - 15 Gold This table should just about get you past the 100 gold limit. The crafting system mentioned earlier coupled with the ability to get repeats really dilutes the value of your cards.06/12/2016: The gold gain is no longer 100 gold per day. 01/02/2017: Gold gain is now possible with 100 gold and 1 free common card per day. 6. Imbalanced due to turn orderStarting first is usually worst, in my opinion. The system is similar to Hearthstone where you begin with 1 less mana crystal. Going first also means you are 1 step further away from the middle mana spring.7. No Neutral SpellsWhy are all the spells locked up based on faction? Why are there only neutral minions? Where are the neutral spells?8. Wasted first turnsSometimes, based on the Random Number Generator and turn order, you can't curve your cards, which means playing a 2, then a 3, then a 4 and so on and so forth. There are many times where you start out first and have no 2 cost card. Sure, you can change your strategy and wait for more mana but this feels forced instead of being a choice.9. Battle Pets [Expansion Pack]With the new expansion, Denizens of Shenizar, the RNG has been greatly increased with Battle Pets. Battle Pets attack opponents ""randomly"", which probably means they wrote an alogrithim for who they want to win the game.10. Mystery CratesThis is flat out gambling for skins. You get a key if you get ranked high enough or if you get buy it. It's the same thing with Team Fortress. I really dislike it.12. Super UnbalancedFirst player starts with 2 mana, second player starts with 3.After the first 3 turnsFirst player : 2+3+4 = 9 manaSecond player : 3+4+5 = 12 manaAfter the first 5 turnsFirst player : 2+3+4+5+6 = 20 manaSecond player : 3+4+5+6+7 = 25 manaAs you can see, the maths always favours the second player who also has a free mana well. What cards can be played is also limited. If you start with 2 mana, you can only ever play 2 mana cards.13. Overpowered Battle PetsThe math for the Battle Pets stats are ridiculous. It's so broken. E.g. Yun, a 3 mana 5/4 Battle Pet. Ion, a 3 mana 2/3 Battle Pet with Range, that does twice the damage to Generals. A normal 3 cost ranged unit is only 2/2 and adds 20% to summoning Mechazor.14. Hand DrawsThe game only allows you to redraw 2 out of the 5 cards. Why you can't redraw your entire hand? Just to prevent consistency? 15. Low Player PopulationIt started out with a large fanbase but it seems the fans are leaving due to issues like rarity creep.NEUTRAL1. Patch ChangesSometimes, the patches create major nerfs/buffs. E.g. Shadow Nova used to cost 7, with each Shadow Creep dealing damage equal to the number of Shadow Creep on the board. Now, it costs 4, with each Shadow Creep dealing 1 damage.I'm fine with this as games do need to be balanced but it is not a good thing.2. 2 Card to 1 Card draw per turnPersonally, I preferred the alpha version of drawing 2 cards per turn. The reason is that it is usually more difficult to do a comeback victory with just 1 card. Based on what I understand, they stopped it because the hand size limit is 6 and drawing 2 cards per turn would cause cards to overflow for certain races like Vetruvian.3. LorePersonally, I like reading it but the game doesn't emphasize the lore much.4. SkinsI like games where they sell skins instead of trying to affect the gameplay with a P2W system and rarity creep. However, in this one, there is a P2W model.SUGGESTIONS1. Price BarrierDo note that Duelyst has a paywall for competition. People who have no money can't play with a full set. They can only play with what they have grinded. 2. Final MoveIf Duelyst ever reaches a point where you realise that the paywall prevents new entrants from coming in and your player population drops to near zero, do consider this suggestion. Open up all the cards to everyone. No more rares, no more grinding, full everything. Then sell players fancy skins and animations at <$2 each to recoup. At no point must you consider creating a gameplay mechanic differential that is due to money. If you think the current business model is sustainable, then forget I ever said anything.			"

Then it crashed again right after the next game I played. Then it crashed during a game I played. Oh yeah, and this was inthe PRACTICE MODE. On the LOWEST GRAPHICS SETTINGS.Say what you want about Hearthstone, but at least it didn't crash every single time you played a round of the goshdarned game!UPDATE: So I decided to uninstall and redownload the game to see if it ran any better. After doing that, I tried the online multiplayer. Let's just say that the less I say about that terrible lagfest, the better.At least Hearthstone only lagged when it was searching for people!

												FF tactics combined with TCG mechanics in a fantasy setting complete with very rich lore (complete with a beautifully drawn world map O.o) with voiceover ( I just died x.x) makes Duelyst a pretty awesome game.

Being an avid fan of fantasy novels I absolutely love these kind of things and also because I'm the type of gamer that reads everything in a game.

												Outside of the actual game, Duelyst is literally hearthstone. There's daily goals for gold, which you can spend on five-card packs or draft arena tickets. There's a constructed mode with a brutal meta. There's several different class archetypes with unique mechanics.Now, i'm a weirdo who would rather rub my face on a cheese grater than play a draft arena, so this game is absolutely not for me, and yet, i love the *idea* of it so much anyway. Duelyst looks gorgeous, sounds incredible, and the *game* part of it is genius. It's just a shame that all the parts of it that aren't gameplay are hearthstone.			"

												A longtime fan and player of Hearthstone, I've rejected nearly every other CCG-style strategy game on offer. Those that I chose to play, I was often met with disappointment. I'm a sucker for good pixel art, so Duelyst caught my interest. For once, I don't regret it. The gameplay is solid, the UI is wonderful, the strategy is deep. Offering a grid combat system a la Heroes of Might and Magic enables complexity of strategy while implementing tried-and-true CCG mechanics, with some twists. Give the game a shot, you have nothing to lose but a moment of your time.And if you find yourself in-game but not ready for a match, listen to the brilliantly narrated Codex. Such a treat.			"

												The creators put great care into making an innovative take on familiar formats. The matches are quick, and thanks to the addition of a countdown timer, fairly fast paced. The core elements of the game will be familiar to many, but Counterplay Games has interwoven familiar mechanics from previously disparate styles into a deep and challenging turn based strategy game. You may find, as you progress, that the starter cards don't hold up quite as well at the higher ranks, so expect to be buying packs if you want to become a really hardcore player. There are however, daily challenges to complete, and if you are dilligent, it is easy to earn a slow but steady stream of Spirit Orbs, the game's name for its card packs. The packs themselves seem reasonable and there is a starter pack discount if you are a new player- a good bargain and way to support the devs.All in all, Duelyst oozes with animated style, and is very tactically complex. A must play for any competitive strategy fans.			"

												Review before 18 Feb 2017. (2nd entry)Score: 8.5/10 (+1)Commentary: 1. Its like Hearthstone, except you get to move your king and summons like a chess piece, and of course you whack your opponent's king hp to 0 to win the game.2. The game utilises movement of every units's mechanism as a core strategy, with 3 mana orb at the center of the map to be conquered or just left alone.3. Custom your card deck 40/404. Lots of hidden unlockable ""Kings"" with their own natural abilities that just seems OP in their own way, which is fun.5. Graphic is pixelated, spell effect makes your eye ♥♥♥♥♥♥.6. Card Abilities are creative, especially the ""Range/Blast"" and ""Air Drop"" summons excluding the classic mechanism/abilities from Hearthstone7. Paywall exists of course, content: card box & specific map access8. Comparing through the 5 card games i had played so far... this one requires the most in having more skills in strategy than RNG in drawing your cards. (partially thanks to the Card Replacement ability)9. You will start seeing an immense amount of experience differences starting rank 15, where lots of uncommon cards are involved and put into battle more frequently than you've ever seen, and the best part of the game you'd be in, is the unimaginable effects each and every card can be utilised to create the perfect destructive results.10. Fun but limited time events, including puzzle solving and reallly hard AI bosses to tackle for challenges.0. Cards are hard to grind :/			"

												Really great fast-paced digital CCG that I've been playing for months. The board is an interesting innovation for a CCG, and it makes the game so much better. This game loves to give you plenty of decisions to best play out your strategy, and certainly isn't a card game that plays itself.The art and music are awesome as well!Posting this review since the game has been recently added to Steam, and I want to support it.

												I've been looking for a MMO card game on PC and this is a good match! Gameplay is the usual per turn until finish pattern with mana points being the limiting factor for actions per turn. There are several sets of  cards with their unique sets of powers and abilities  chosen through different 'generals'. The cards can be mixed with other cards but limited to the generals' specific cards and neutral cards.All cards are earnable and more can be gained through IAPs in the game but it wouldn't overthrow non paying players as there's a limit to the cards one can bring to the match. So I would not call this pay-to-win. Other IAPs include emotes and skins.Duelyst gets a recommend from me but I have an initial feeling that the gameplay will become dull as the main tactic of the game is to overwhelm your opponent - not letting them have minions and the like.

												Just a side note, I've been playing since December 2015. Don't want the hours on Steam to throw anyone off, I've played this for ages and never bored of it.Everything about this game is just amazing. The developers care for the game and it's players, and actively interect with the community. I mean seriously, the devs meme around with everyone on discord. It's great. The artwork is incredible: every unit has a unique animation that really brings the game to life. I could try and talk about everything amazing about this game, the soundtrack, the monthly updates, the lore behind each card as well as the stories in the codex, the deck building tools, the endless combos and strategy, and most of all the ability to play competitvly with top tier decks without spending a dime, but in order to go into depth I would have to miss out on my daily quests. Just look at the other reviews. If they're saying good things about the game, (they will be) whatever they say is probably true. It's a great game, it's free, it's fun, just get it.			"

												Backed this game on kickstarter and so far I'm impressed. Short matches, easy to learn but difficult to master. If I compared it to a board game, it's a like a card game and chess. Or hearthstone and FF tactics. Has some pretty major glitches though that prevent me from playing however. WHile scrolling through my card collection, the game freezes and I have to force close, making it impossible to make my own custom deck. A little problimatic but I'm sure this will be fixed at some point.			"

												Duelyst is THE collectible trading card video game to play right now. If you can compare it to anything, it's very similar to Hearthstone, except it comes in a nice a package that isn't packed with Blizzard ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Positives-Cards are easy to collect. The community has proven statistically that you have a one ine four chance of getting a legendary in a pack, AKA Spirit Orbs. Spirit can also be collected to craft specific cards. Gauntlet runs (similar to Hearthstone arena) can bolster your card collection even further once you are good enough at the game.-In game gold is easy to collect. You do not have to win your daily quests, you just have to simply play the game. On top of that you earn more gold from winstreaks and simply returning from the game after a period of not playing.-A lot less RNG than Hearthstone. While there are some RNG cards, the game is mostly skill based.-The grid board, like chess rewards players with more skill. Players can also practice different kinds of board states with their daily 'Lethal Puzzle' quest, for example killing the enemy in one turn with only a certain amount of moves or cards.-Good balance design. The developers AKA Counterplay Games, aren't afraid to completely rehaul and balance the game properly. They are not stubborn unlike other video game developers. Their balance philosophy is close to Dota 2's Icefrog, where different patches and versions of the game more often than not feel like a completely new game, but not in a bad way. Each faction/class feels unique and overall viable.-The lore in this game is absolutely incredible. The writers are good enough to write their own book, as it's better than most I've read.Negatives-Even though legendary cards are easy to collect compared to other collect trading card games. You are allowed to run 3 copies of the same card in a deck you create. This means at the higher level decks will need a lot of legendaries or epics.-The community is currently relatively small to medium sized. But it is growing rapidly, and I'm sure it will with it's upcoming release on Steam. As the community is still growing, there is also no casual mode as it was removed due to dividing the already small community between casual and ranked. Howerver this mode will probably return in the future.-Graphics, if you are a fussy gamer and prefer higher quality graphics this is not your game. Though the actual artwork and animations within the game are good. The devs make the pixelated graphics work well with what they have if you're able to move pass the fact that the graphics aren't up to scratch compared to other games. "

												My favorite current ccg and hopefully the new standard for other developers working in the genre.I just donwloaded the client for steam and my playtime is low here but I have actually been playing Duelyst since Beta. What your going to find here is a marriage of a chess-like tactical map and magic the gathering CCG combat. Faeria would be the closest comparision that I am aware of and while Faeria has a decent following Duelyst is easily my favorite of the two.FeaturesStrategic PostioningDeck-buildingStrong Roster of Generals and Factions to support different playstylesGenerous F2P model that allows new players to accumlate cards at a decent clipGood Player Base - quick matchmaking, decent community, support availble and advised for new players if you ask around on the forums (reddit)Active Updates - There is a constant push to make sure the game is balanced and steady influx of new cards and featuresPixel Art - Beatifully designed if you ask me and even if it's not your thing I find it hard to believe you cannot at least appreciate th amount of time and detail put in hereOn the other hand....Slow Paced Games - Can be time consuming to get through a few matches and the early learning curve can slow it down to crawl when your getting started.Tough Competition - I have seen more than a few complaints that the hardcore player base and there level of profeciency in the upper ranks makes for frustration when you are trying to climb the ladderNo Single Player - This is PVP based game and there's nothing planned as far as a campaignMonotone - At times your going to see alot of play from the same nuetral minions (as in the same 2 drop minions in  95 percent of the decks you will face) and it can get a little bit repetitive in that regard. This was my biggest gripe with the game a few months ago and seems to have improved after the last few big patches.Probably not a good fit for the casual playerIf you have played H-stone and want to graduate to a more advanced digital card game this would be high on my list of recommendations (Infinity Wars, Solforge, and few others are in the conversation as well). I am looking forward to the first major expansion at the end of the month witch may wind up pushing my score even higher.For now....8.5/10  "

												I've been playing Duelyst for about 3 months now, ever since Scrolls closed.The game is great; one of the better digital card games I've played.

They have a full fledged streamer program, where you can register for streamer rewards (items for giveaways, and even fiscal rewards). One of the most interesting parts of the developer support is that each month they introduce four new cards.

												This game deserves far more credit than it gets. A very strong Hearthstone style free to play, fast paced card battler with a chess-like grid and the added depth that unit placement & movement brings to the formula. If you like card games, or turn based games you should really enjoy this one. It also has a pretty fair progression system that does not require you to spend money to be decent at the game (but of course it does not hurt to drop some cash at its feet to speed up progression). It is also worth noting that the game has very rewarding deckbuilding and tons of cards to choose from. The art and sound will not blow you away or anything but you can tell they did they best they could with the budget and time they had in making this one. They even added lots of voice acted lore and backstory to read through if you want to. Highly reccomended, just be ready to eventually hit a wall where you have to really plan, think and execute well or get your face stomped in.			"

(Most cards can be earned quickly, the cards rairty does not always matter. It depends on how you play it.)-Fun fighting against friends or playing solo (climbing the rank ladder). -Many ways to customize your gameplay/ play style. (Icons, Skins, or Ect./ The 12 different factions)Cons : -RNG (How Many Times I lost to this).-No casual option (Force to play online in rank, since there is only 3 options (Bots, Monthly rank ladder, and gauntlet (Duelyst version of Arena in Hearthstone)).Overall I think this game is great and would recommend you give it a try :D.

Tempo and aggro decks can feel pretty strong in this current expansion if you dont have a answer for keeping it under control. For every other lover of ccg and strategy games youll find something to love here. With small expansion sizes not taking away from the main set this game is still relatively cheap to get into.			"

												This game combines the characteristic of HearthStone and Chess. I like the feel that the units stand and attack on the battlefield, and the strategy which is more complicated from HearthStone and Chess. (Daily Challenge is awesome!)But I still feel some strange about the UI design:1.The minions have card form in my collection,  and stay in action bar without card form, but enter the battlefield as the card form appears, then loss card form again. So it is “+,-,+,-“ changing all the time. It confused me.2.When the enemy turn start, I will see a red grid is moving as the enemy player is thinking. This is not a good interaction, because it confused my eye.3.As the minion makes a melee attack, you will the enemy minion will counterattack with 0 HP. Can a dead person attack? Why aren’t they attacking at the same time? It confused me.4.Some other suggestion: May the General Bar can change to the bottom of the screen next to the action bar. Then the Enemy Bar can place on top like a copy of ours. (So we can show more information about the enemy.)May we have ability like automatic move and attack when an enemy is 1 grid away. May we have ability like attack enemy, push him 1 grid back, and move back 1 grid too.May we have ability like move a straight line and damage the nearby enemy.May we have ability like attack 3*3 grid enemies and move them like circle.May we have ability like kill an enemy and get one more action.May we have ability like kill an enemy and boom the nearby.May…Confuse me and take my money!

												OMG this game is so great. I randomly stumbled upon it one night and I am glad I did. It takes elements of Fire Emblem and Hearthstone and makes it into one great game. The sprites are great and so are the attack animations. You can come up with different strategies depending on what cards you have in your deck. If you are bored and need a challenge get this game and add me and you can try to beat me. Ohohoohoohhoho :)			"

												I really like the game when I first played it, but ever update seemed to scew balance between factions more. Neutral are not too powerful, rare cards dominate commons making it very P2W, and ever-present RNG elements make the game much more about paying money and getting lucky than it is about skill and tactics. Neat idea, bad execution. Try Shardbound, that game's basically the same, but not ruined, yet.			"

												Amazing game, takes an interesting genre and does it better than, in my opinion, any other game. The playing board helps fix the issue other card games often have of being rng and deck reliant, whereas Duelyst uses some actual skill. It also is really fast to start getting cards, which means you aren't inhibited by bad decks and forced to pay for cards (but that option is available if you want to speed it up). Overall, 10/10 one of my favorite games, thanks cpg for this wonderful thing <3			"

												This game is my new Hearthstone from some time and I was playing Hearthstone for about 3 years!Duelyst is deep, great looking, interesting, challenging and satysfying. Game is fequently updated and there is ton of cards. Each time I play it gets intense and I never feel bs p2w or anything like it. I have bought one booster pack for 5$ (less than I have spent on arenas in HS :D ) and right now I have 2 full competetive decs and I land in diamond divisin each seassson while playing couple mathes not even daily so I think this is a very balanced business model in Duelyst.You like HS or other card games but u wan to check what happens when you mix board in it? Just play this GREAT game! :D			"

												So I recently got myself into card games, it all started from Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links on my phone, it was fun checking/collecting cards, winning duels, losing duels, creating personal decks or you can copy/innovate from those who post their decks online. But then some things just annoyed me in game; you can only summon 3 monsters and use 3 spell/trap cards,then there's the constant blabbering betwen the 2 characters before and after every duel, also the duel is locked in potrait and you can't change it to landscape, plus the menu has so much of everything(I guess). Next, I tried Hearthstone, it has a nice, slick, easy-to-read UI, nothing too fancy but the decks are hard to earn, you need real dedication to get new packs which I lack. Then I suddenly stumbled myself onto this beauty, it has a simple, readable UI, fairly earned packs, different characters have their unique ablilities and cards (not just a single card), really well done pixel art and splash art for each characters, so far a balanced gameplay for each character and last but not least the beautiful art of the menu background and each boards that you come acrossI really highly recommnd this game who're interested in card games, great stuff			"

												Pros: good idea: MTG meets tacticle RPGGood Graphics: this looks great, I'm sure a lot of work went into designing and animating hundreds of unique sprites.It's free: I can theoretically play it and earn new cards without ever paying a cent.No chat function: The only thing worse than playing with a jerk is having them talk♥♥♥♥♥♥the whole time. This game has emotes instead which people can still use to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but it's better.Cons:Imbalanced, Broken mana system: The first player to capture mana nodes has a exponential advantage. Also The second player ALWAYS starts in immediate reach of a node. It may be nice if the nodes were placed randomly, but I don't see that happining.Irritating f2p elements: ""you got a rare chest, but you have to pay for a key to open it"". I'd gladly pay full price and not have my progression hobbled. But instead the game has no price ceiling if you want to actually compete. Steep difficulty curve: I always feel underpowered when playing online because I know almost everyone I am matched up against wil just win because the put more time or money into it. When I win It always feels like luck.Frustrating: No matter how hard I try I can not seem to have any fun with this game. Even when I'm winning I am having no fun. I always seem to walk away from this game angry.I generally enjoy MTG and Yu-gi-oh. But this game seems to inherit the aspects that most turn me off of those games. It'd be nice to play a card game where you can have fun on a hobbyist level. A card game that rewards experimentation. And this is not it.Like any other TCG you're going to be stomped into paste by god monsters exploited by obsessive number crunchers. You don't get to be a novice, you're not allowed to grow in your own way, you google a build or you get wrecked.			"

												I've first played this in beta (~a year ago) and spent a decent amount of time and money on it playing through the standalone client.I can recommend this game if you're a casual gamer and just want to try something different, the spacial aspect of the game adds a super fun and interesting layer to deckbuilding (refreshingly non-RNG-y) and piloting, but I can not recommend this game if you don't enjoy hyper-aggressive cancer.When I last played the game, admittedly this was a couple of months ago (I did minor research for this review, nothing much at all seems changed in terms of top tier decks), I mostly played Tempo Lyonar (Argeon) and had great success with it, simply because it can outlast Burnhai and outtempo a lot of midrange decks, but sometimes due to the nature of movement and RNG, you just get burned down way too fast, you get slowed down immensely by insanely overbudgeted taunts, or other such joys. On the flipside of this, there is so much removal...games in Duelyst constructed often feel like a seesaw of tempo, massive swings in either direction all of the time. Personally, the absolutely mental stat budgets were the biggest dealbreaker, and made the game feel very poorly balanced. There are some nice archetypes in the game, but they're usually either ineffective or super cheesy. Gauntlet (arena) felt awful, for the stat budgets exacerbate the imbalance between classes in arena even more, I have both flown through virtually unopposed and been crushed like a bug, with little to no possible consistency, worse than in any other TCG I have played (HS, ES:L, Eternal, Magic Duels).If you'd like to play a game with a good ingame(!)-community, with a nice new spin on the genre but a TON of gimmicks, give this a try.Did I enjoy myself to a level that matches my spending? Not really, I found the experience hugely unpleasant overall.			"

												This game is awesome.. I realy like its pixel art, game mechanics.. everything...except it's almost pure pay2win.While most of new players.. just like me.. have to play with starter packs..(and can modify them maybe by 2-3 better cards..)I'm not stupid.. i made it to silver 17/3..(16 with closed eye) after I switched to Vanar starter deck..but within 1 hour i dropped to rank 18 and since then I'm struggling on rank 20..- Because I'm quite often matched up against ppl with hundreds of won games..last guy had badges worth 1400 wins..- struggling against people with rare/legendary/whatever decks with spells giving ppl massive boosts .. spawning 2-4 mobs with high stats.. etc..- quite often I end up fighting against full field of oppnent minions while he nonostop has 4 cards in hand an I'm playing with ONE because i simply can't counter their neverending rebirth/respawn/grow/dispel/remove/whenever xy/draw/.. etc- can't farm gold because I either can't compete with any starter deck / mash up from what I got.. or I'm earning 5gold at best ..- I can't craft cards that I would like to use because I can't disenchant 90% of cards I own/get..And It realy doesn't matter how ""low budget guides"" you find.. you can't just earn those damn spirit points.. Whenever I win 1-4 rounds I lose 14 in streak ..I could go on.. but this should be enough insight for newcomers..I realy like this game..I like it when you finish off an opponent that was actualy dominating you most of the time..but it's super frustrating how you are basicaly punched in face by huge difference between spenders anf f2p.. I recommend to try out this game.. for whatever reason.. I started playing it for the pixel art..and it's menu screen is just pure gold.But If you are person like me that won't pump single penny into any micropayment nonsense, p2p .... expect to be sad/mad sooner or later.and games should bring ppl some joy.. not dissapointment..

												Duelyst is basically Hearthstone, only with cooler characters, animated pixel-art cards,and a grid to place and manipulate your cards on. Plus, your hero, or General, has a muchmore interesting role, being able to move around and fight independently of your othercards, so it's much more fun and you feel as if you have your own part in the fight. The music is great and the artwork is dazzling. On top of that, it's free to play, and noteven pay-to-win as of this moment. What's your excuse for NOT trying it?			"

												Get a crate containing cards as a reward for a mission or quest. Try to open it, don't have a key. Where to get a key? Buy one with real money. Its a typical mmo tgp. Unless you want to pay real money, the pro's and con's, goods and bads all these reviews are filled with, just smoke and mirrors. The strategy with this game is pay money for better cards or be under-resourced its as simple as that. Sure you'll have fun playing matches in the lowest rank tier, but once you get into the next tier unless you want to pay money, you'll lose so much more than you'll win. Unless you are the kind of person that is content with using the daily quests for weeks and weeks to collect enough power cards to be competitive. If thats you go for it.I will say this about the strategy of the game though. You can't sideboard cards in. Some decks are so bad against others, Any person that has played a tgp knows not having the option to side certain cards in depending on the deck you are matched against means there are games you have no shot at winning, period. But thats whatever, i'm done with the game since im not going to pay or have the patience to do daily quests to keep up.			"

												Duelyst has great pixel art. Unfortunately that is about where the positives stop.The reward systems have forever been in constant flux, presumably with both new player retention and sustainable monetisation being the goal. Every change they make to these systems seems to have no impact on the former whilst also annoying existing players to no end.The gameplay seems to become less focussed on interactivity with every patch. It almost doesn't even matter that the game is played on a board at this point.In Duelyst, cards have effects that can be faction specific, affecting or not affecting cards within a certain faction. There are multiple factions in Duelyst. There are no indicators on the cards stating what faction they are from. Slightly less condemning, although condemning nonetheless, are that the cards have no indicator for what set/expansion they originate from. This is not as much of an issue within the deck builder, but it is an issue during gameplay.I feel I have given this game a good run and would not recommend it at all.			"

												At first I thought it was balanced since you could get cards fast, but unless you drop money for rare cards you're not going to be able to move up ranksUpdate: I think at this point, its really not worth trying to enter as a new player. All the comments basically ammounted to just get more cards/focus on a good deck, while the entire way there is loosing to those people with the better decks just because I don't have one yet. There were a couple games against people with decks like mine that were incredibly tense and fun, but once you get towards rank 10 its just too many people with decks I won't have for a month. And since the first expansion came out, I don't expect to have all the best cards by the time everyone else has moved on again. Good luck to the players already in this.			"

												Agree with most people that tells the ""Not recommended"" factor.Again, this is free to play. If you are grateful, just be grateful. The developer seems make a little mistake that not seriously taking care of it. The issues is : 1. Some un-balance deck ( Poor Magmar deck. Sometimes you devil, sometimes you potato) . 2. Rank match is less fun after you climbing higher rank (My experience tells it. Reached rank 13 is my limit. Those people ARE scary.) 3. The scarier than that, is the matchmaking system. (I just wish to meet some decent players with same ""Experience"" as me)Yes, i no need to tell that the graphic art is VERY BEAUTIFUL. The sprite animation as well, is make you keep playing this Duelyst. And, this graphic quality from free game, is the best. Also, it is not pay to win. You still have that hope.Just adding my story, after 200 hrs + , i lost my interest somehow. That is happen after developer adding boss match mode and free card redeem for changing the daily quest (I think they are tired to creating somehow need-brain-most daily quest match. But still, i am feel that they really workin' on that daily quest) . Maybe the main reason is the motonous rank match and sick of the unbalance matchmaking (Just FYI, you must learn to create your deck CAREFULLY. Find that via Duelyst forum, or google it to make the best deck that fit you well ) .The last thing is : Do i recommend this game ?YES. Just try. Then, you could see by yourself. After all, let's give it applause that this is something quality they have (That graphic art, with card game, WITH SPRITE ANIMATION AND IT IS FREE TO PLAY ? come on . . . Why not ?) Just hope that developer will listen their community. It will helps this game better.			"

The card packs have abysmal drop rates for rare cards and crafting them requires tons of resources.- No Unranked mode so you're forced to play against try hards and smurfs, there's no mode to try out decks against people.- Ranked matches sometimes award you with 'Mystery Boxes' which contain all sorts of goodies (cards, resources etc) but there's no way to open them unless you $pend real money on a key.- Imbalanced Factions, some have clear advantage over others.- Feels like an alpha, not a finished product.

												LET'S TALK ABOUT PRICING. Duelyst has a lot of nice stuff to like about it. I know a lot of people are used to F2P games; I am not. These prices are silly. Let's look at them.Duelyst Micro-transaction Prices:40 card packs - $50Emote Packs - $13 eachGeneral Skins - $8 eachCard Backs - $4 each Profile Pictures - $3 eachLet's compare those prices to some full games. Steam is full of B2P (buy to play) games that are reasonably priced, get cheaper over time, and don't have hidden costs down the line. There are competitive multiplayer games in B2P that are very replayable too, not just short single player games. Entire Full Games (sale prices):AAA games 1-2 yrs old ~ $30Chaos Reborn - $7XCom EU Complete - $10 XCom 2 Digital Deluxe - $40. Also has an often overlooked VS MP mode.Disgaea 1 PC - $15Civ V Complete ~ $15100% Orange Juice with all DLC ~ $11Minecraft - $27 (Doesn't go on sale?)Misc Indie Stuff Everywhere - $3-$7 Duelyst has huge ""microtransactions"" that are each larger than many B2P games. If Duelyst was B2P, it would probably be $15, and maybe get one or two $10 optional DLC expansions. Both the base game and DLC would go on sale too. Because Duelyst is F2P, it costs $$$$$ to get everything. Please compare F2P games to B2P games you already own (free!) and B2P games you could buy instead.			"

												The starter pool of cards is decent and can carry you quite a ways. A lot of the achievements will give you legendaries and there are plenty of cards to unlock through leveling.It's a fun game, but honestly has the same problem all these games have.  There is no option to buy into what you want to play.  You have to go through this slot machine system, that is essentially gambling or wasting massive amounts of time. Basically if you're playing F2P, expect to spend >50 hours of top tier play to grind enough 'spirit' to craft a deck you want to play.  Or you can gamble your money away and break down pack after pack to craft what you want.  Still going to spend quite a lot of money to do so and at the mercy of RNG.  I'll put it to you like this.  If you're looking for a time waster, something fun and skillful, but still decided by RNG. This is a fun game to play for a few matches a day.However... it's designed so that you hit a barrier and want to spend money. Once you've got those 10 or so achievement legendaries, they get real scarce.  So you're stuck grinding out the randomness of draft so you can finally get a deck you want to play. I'm actually going to uninstall it now, because I don't appreciate being strung along and manipulated.  This monetization method lacks the base integrity to put a price on a product and thrives because there are so many fools who throw money at it.    The time to grind is needlessly inflated to extend in game time while a 'buy stuff' button is put in our face.  TL;DR: F2P needs infinite patience. P2P needs infinite money.  "

												As both a turn-based strategist and card game lover Duelyst really does fuse both of these elements together in an extremely enjoyable fashion.Duelyst is a card game with a twist - instead of your monsters lining up akin to a game of dodgeball, Played on a 9 by 5 board the object (like most card games) is to reduce your opposing general's health to zero. However instead of just being a number, your general is a monster on the board, capable of moving and attacking (they begin with an attack value, something other card games don't offer).Starting play begins with you drawing 5 cards, and the option to exchange 2 of them immediately. The player going first begins with 2 mana crystals while the player going second begins with 3 (maximum of 9). You may play as many cards per turn as you can afford, as well as exchange 1 card per turn in an effort to find what you need. Cards are split into 3 types: Monsters, who are summoned next to either your general or another monster (so positional play is very important), Spells and Artifacts (items you equip to your general, up to a maximum of 3, that can be destroyed once your general is damaged 3 times while wearing it). You only play cards on your opponents turn, and card drawing is done at the end of the turn allowing you to strategise and plan your next turn more effectively. There are 8 factions, all who contain 2 different general options, that have differing playstyles depending on if you wish to brute force your opponent with creatures (Magmar) or sneakily sap their life force away (Songhai).The main reason I feel the game is excellent is the ability to exchange cards, both initial hand and each turn) as well as the grid allowing for a more in-depth strategy meaning a single misplaced monster at the wrong time will ruin your whole game!

												In my opinion i must say that duelyst is a must play game, for all those who love playing strategy games. Duelyst requires more skills to play as compared to most of the other card games, as players who required to kite their enemies strategcally to avoid being caught up, etc. However it would be even better to have more interactive skills, such as the ability to camouflage or u can choose to use your minions to guard an direct attack for u (rather than just having the ability to provoke enemy).

												I've been playing this game for a few months now, and I'm still thoroughly enjoying it. The developers have continued to change the game rewards, the expansion decks, and now the boss battles. While it is definitely skewed for the players that pay (what ""free"" card game isn't?), I have yet to pay a cent and I still think I do pretty well in the game. The cards are often revised based on community reviews which is great and shows a genuine care from the developers. I highly recommend for people that are fans of chess and/or magic the gathering. I like the visual look of the game with the pixel characters among an almost watercolor background. If you want to waste some hours for free, definitely try this one.			"

												Duelyst is a 1v1 card game that also utilizes a full map to add more strategy and planning. The learning curve is not that steep, after the tutorial I pretty much played about 3 practice games to learn a deck, then a few solo challenges to learn other aspects of the game like unit abilities, spells, buffs, and debuffs. After that I felt confident enough to dive right into ranked to play other people. The ingame visuals took me by surprise as your generals/minions/spells are all fully animated in gorgeous pixelated art. As a F2P it is forgiving to the player as you can earn a lot of the card packs and other in game content just by playing. As for what I think could be improved, it could use a difficulty setting in practicing against the computer. If I'm trying to build the perfect deck to play in ranked I would want harder AI to experiment on. Also it could use an ingame chat so you could talk to your opponent as all you can do right now is use emotes or phrases. But looking at how well recieved this title has been so far, I wouldn't be surprised if it rivals other up and coming card games like Elder Scrolls Legends or Gwent.			"

												One of the better online 'card' games out there. Great RNG mitigation mechanics built in to the system itself. Plays very creature/minion heavy (ie. Hearthstone) but with the addition of the tactical board there are a lot more interesting decisions to be made. Each faction feels unique and has different Generals that change playstyles. The addition of daily challenges (lethal puzzles), a solo challenge campaign, and tons of voiced lore round out the package. Speaking of lore, the pixel art is beautiful and brings out the character of the cards. Each card is uniquely animated. As a free to play game, there are many opportunities to gain currency for cards, as well as quests that give you rare and legendary cards for free. Compared to Hearthstone, the Gauntlet (Arena) is easier to go infinite as well (because of better rewards).			"

												Absolutely love this game. Been playing since January this year and it gets better with every update! It seems kinda pointless to go too much into gameplay detail since you can just download and try it yourself, but I'll at least say that if you have any sort of interest in CCGs or tactical games, this is one that you can't pass up.I'll also mention that it is very generous to new players (significantly moreso than games like Hearthstone), both with relatively frequent epic/legendary rarity card drops AND excellent starting cards that you can find use for even in high rank decks. Easy daily quests with well-sized gold rewards mean you can expect to be earning a minimum of 1 spirit orb (booster pack) a day within an average of 4 matches, even if you don't win any of them!Aaaaand if you want a free 100 gold (aka a free booster pack) to start with, you should use ""dag"" as your referral :)			"

I wish that you got more than 5 cards per card orb pack thing at a time with at least one being uncommon or better, maybe 8 and 2 of them being uncommon or better instead? still a good and fun game and i'd recomend you give it a try.

												Before you say this is just pixel art Heartstone and write it off please read: Honestly is has such less RNG based cards than Heartsone, plus the chess-board allows for more strategy so not the person who has the best cards and spent the most money wins all the time. I've only been playing for a few months and buying minimal packs I have rose fairly high in the ranks on strategy alone. Plus it's waaaaaaay cheaper than Heartstone, you gain packs at a much higher rate and has extra unlockable stuff besides cards for those who spend money. Plus in my opinion it's a lot prettier (every card is animated, holy ♥♥♥♥ that's a lot of work). Have fun.			"

												Jedyna innowacyjna karcianka jaka kiedykolwiek powstała. Łączy mechanikę walki znaną z takich gier jak Heroes of Might and Magic (Popularni przecież u nas ""Herosi 3"") czy king's bounty z zaawansowaną karcianką. Naszą armią są po prostu karty, których używajac wstawiamy naszego podpoiecznego do gry lub używamy na nim czaru. Dzięki temu gre docenią zarówno fani karcianek, którzy lubią spędzać dziesiątki godzin na tworzeniu własnej, niepokonanej talii, ale również miłośnicy gier turowych czy wręcz gatunku RTS, którzy cenią rozgrywką opartą o pozycjonowanie i przewidywanie ruchów przeciwnika na polu bitwy. Gra jest warta spróbowania, a przepiękna, moim zdaniem, oprawa audiowizaulna łącząca pixel art, chiptune i ""nowoczesny"" szlif pomoże nam wsiąknąć do tej gry na wiele, wiele godzin. Dodatkowo wraz z jej wejściem na Steam, wykorzystuje ona od teraz portfel Steam, dzięki czemu za fundusze które uzyskamy poprzez rynek możemy dokonywać mikrotranskacji w grze. W grze która na rynku gier karcianych ma aktualnie najbardziej zdrowe podejście do tej sprawy. Oczywiście nie można stwierdzić, że mikrotranskajce nie istnieją, ponieważ znajdują się jak w każdej grze f2p, lecz ich uciążliwość w porównaniu do tego co serwuje Blizzard w Hearthstone jest znikoma. Brakuje tutaj dodatków dostępnych tylko za pieniądze, nie będziemy też płacić za żadne dodatkowe ekspansje, a kiedy tylko mamy ochotę możemy sprzedać naszego ""kałacha"", ""czapeczkę"" czy ""itemek"" z którejś inej gry wykorzystującej rynek i wykupić za nie dodatkowe rzeczy w Duelyst. Bardzo zdrowa, przepiękna i posiadająca miłe community gra, którą tworzy dość niezależne studio posiadające pasję w tym co robią. Nic tylko zasiadać do gry i ślinić się do pixelów, uśmieżających ból po tym jak przeciwnikowi siądą do ręki wszytskie karty które chciał. Bo przecież, chyba o to tutaj chodzi. O symulator frustrtacji okraszony przepiękną grafiką.

While sharing many similarities with HS, I consider Duelyst to be the next evolutionary step in online CCGs.  The depth of gameplay blows everything else I've tried out of the water.  Counterplay Games is very active in the community and you can tell they love the game as much as their playerbase.  The community is inclusive, helpful, passionate, and fun to be a part of.  Furthermore, Duelyst is by far the most generous CCG from a free2play perspective.  Gold can be earned quickly, and the drop rates of legendary and epic cards is insane.  With the upcoming expansion set to release in the next week, now is the perfect time to join the best kept secret in gaming!			"

												This game is kind of like a cross between chess and Magic the Gathering.  Its broken up into different faction each with its own unique skill set to take advantage of to dominate the playing feild.  You can even custom make your own deck once you get to know the mechanics of the game.  I would suggest this for anyone familer with table top games as its a pretty similer concept.  Rounds usually last 10-15 mins.			"

												Mix Fire Emblem with Hearthstone, and you'll get Duelyst, a fairly rewarding F2P tactics card game.You start with a series of basic tutorials aimed to ge you acquainted with to in-game interface, after which you'll be able to challenge the AI to unlock other factions in practice matches, and the solo  challenges. Solo challenges are puzzle like situations, each with a new twist to introduce you to the different game elements. I recommend prioritizing these challenges as they definitely provided me with the most fun as a new player.Pros:+Unlike traditional card games, Duelyst's board provides a new depth to the gameplay.+The ability to replace a card from your hand with another from your deck each turn, which helps providing some consistency to your deck and allows you to dig for answers, and not just be at the mercy of the draw.+Quests are completed by simply playing rather than forcing you to win, allowing you to learn.+Great soundtracks and gorgeous backgrounds.+The drop rates for high rarity cards is very generous, and you can easily get a pack/orb a day due to rewarding the gold system is.+/- Pixelated characters/units: I don't love nor hate pixel art, but I can say this to you if you hate it: The gameplay's suspense will make the pixels hardly matter.Cons:-A steep difficulty curve-Overpriced Cosmetics (They have no effect on the gameplay though)-Matches are sometimes mentally exhausting, rather than enjoyable.Overall, Duelyst is a fresh take on digital card games that is worth trying out, even if only just to complete the solo challenges.Side Note: Starting players can get a 100 extra gold when they sign-up by entering a referal code, so if you have a friend who plays Duelyst, ask them for their code.

												Duelyst is a game I discovered not long before it went into Open Beta.It caught me by surprise with how good it was in nearly all aspects.The pixel animations are amazing and the creature design, variety and spell effects are very well done. The game itself is very simple to understand using a combination of CCG mechanics to summon creatures onto the board and a grid based tactics system for combat. There's multiple character/factions to choose from each having different selections of cards and mechanics available. You unlock the basic cards for each of these but earning there first few levels and then get more cards from booster packs which can be bought using in game currency. The game features quests to earn currency based rewards and there's a section of puzzles for you to figure out which will really help you learn the game. These are done by being given a pre built hand, creatures on the board and enemies already in place. You are given a single turn to win the game. It's a very cool puzzle mode and it really helps you in the main game as maximising your plays. I highly recommend the game if you like CCG or tactic based games. There's a whole lotta game here. If you would like to see more of the basic gameplay I have a video available that will show the game just before it went into Open Beta before Steam launch. I hope you find this helpful.

												I could make this a really long review but in general this is one of my favorite games of the past few years. The decks are dynamic and have a lot of variety. There's a little bit of RNG in the game but not a lot. I rarely feel like wins and loses are determined by luck. No ladder anxiety thanks to a good ranking system. It's actually possible to be a F2P player and find success, the budget decks are viable at all but the top levels of play. This game is definitely worth your time/money.			"

												like turn based strategy games (fire emblem, ff tactics)? like card games (hearthstone, mtg)? like cool pixel art? then you will love this gameive played this a ton in the off steam beta after playing a fair amount if Hearthstone but ever since ive found this i stopped Hearthstone completely. this game is just so much nicer and more about skill than rng since you not onyl have to draw your cards and make your decks, but you also have to control where your monsters go and how they move/attack which is nice. the game is also SO generous with its card pulls and gold giving, like in hearthstone you could open 20 packs and get maybe 2 epics but in this game ive gotten multiple legendaries and epics from 10 packs. gold is also given out a lot and there are a bunch of one turn kill puzzles that teach you the game and give tons of gold for packs so buying packs isnt really nescessary but tbh i think this game is so great so i dont mind supporting the devs. the game overall is fantastic compared to other ccg games. like i am not that great at it but i still enjoy playing it, even when it gets frustrating (which it definitely does)			"

												I've been playing this game since closed beta, having playing it almost for a year as of now...And all I can say is that it is the best CCG I have played in my entire life, by far. It combines chess elements with card game ones in order to become a tactical experience that is so immersive and deep. Despite the presence of some RNG elements that can make you feel really angry, skill plays the major role in this game, due to the presence of a living board. Positiniong means quite everything in Duelyst, so you have to think carefully about each of your steps. A single mistake can screw your positioning up and leave you wide open to lethal damage.If you are in search for something more skill-based and less luck-based, then this is the game for you.OBS: The game also has astonishing pixel art.

												Meh... overall it is a good game, pure turn-based strategy! However there are a few things that can stress you out, for example:-it happened to me more than once that at the very start of the game I had only spells in my hand (with a default deck) and even the following cards where still spell type... it should have some rule sets to always give you at least 2 random minions at every start...-the starting hands should be more balanced for both players... each player should not have a better starting hand than the other...-when you replace a card it will often come back after you end your turn and draw...-the matchmaking is horrible, I've sprinted thru ranks 30 to 20 without a single loss! And now at rank 18 I'm facing against opponents with higher tier cards... me being a beginner I can't face against opponents who have grinded for god knows how many hours...-some cards could use some more balancing...-cash shop has an option for buying more cards which kinda makes the game pay-to-win... there is a thing called ""spirit orb"" which contains 5 random cards, from these 5 it guarantees a random rare card OR BETTER... for 50 bucks you cand get 40 of these so yeah...-crafting is forcing you to focus on a single faction and overuse it for hours...-art style is kinda weird at first, but I got used to it... also the sounds and music in this game are not that great...-note you can download this game outside of steam! You can't login with your steam account on the duelyst forums but others can login with their game account?!And I think thats all the negatives I can remember for now... despite all that I still like this game, its very competitive! I know I'll get some hate for saying this but I think Duelyst beats Hearthstone! So if you're wondering what to play then you should give this game a chance.			"

												Bom vamos lá pessoal, oque dizer sobre o Duelyst:TL;DR :Dueslyst é um jogo de cartas bem parecido com o famoso hearthstone da Blizzard, embora tenha algumas diferenças cruciais. Uma delas é o fato de existir um tabuleiro aonde o jogador deve posicionar os seus monstros e seu general e movimenta-los durante o jogo.Este tabuleiro implica em diversos aspectos do jogo, como efeitos dos monstros que possuem uma certa área ou cartas que afetam a movimentação dos monstros. Desta forma criando uma atmosfera totalmente única ao jogo.Além destas diferenças da mecânica, Duelyst também possui um modo de desafios que fazem com que o jogador tenha que supera-los para ganhar uma boa quantidade de gold para comprar pacotes. Estes desafios demonstram as diversas possibilidades que podem ocorrer durante o jogo e mostram como alguns turnos podem ser bem complexos.Estas diferenças tornam Duelyst um jogo de cartas diferente dos outros e único nesse aspecto, além de criar uma nova profundidade para o gênero.Análise:Pontos Positivos:* Diversos desafios que fazem o jogador entender diversas mecânicas do jogo.* Os pacotes de cartas reconpensam mais os jogadores em comparação a outros jogos de cartas, desta forma tirando um pouco o peso de comprar cartas.* A complexidade e profundidade do gameplay, devido ao posicionamento das cartas no terreno.* Diversidade de cartas e estratégias.* Novas cartas mensalmente ao fim de cada season, além de balanceamento sendo feito a todo momento.Pontos Negativos:* Mesmo tendo facilidade de adquirir cartas lendárias, a barreira de ser um jogador free ainda existe, embora seja um pouco menos visível.* Tirando o tabuleiro, existe muita semelhanças ao hearthstone como: um modo semelhante a Arena, sistema de ranked, funcionamento geral das cartas e efeitos, preço de pacotes,  etc.Segue análise da gameplay:

												Before I start, I'd like to say that I play a lot of TCGs, some of them work well on PC (as opposed to physical cards IRL), some don't...so far I've only ever played ONE other TCG that was designed specifically for PC (i.e. that wouldn't work as an IRL card game) that I really enjoyed, in its current state this game is exctremely good but without playing it for longer I'm unsure as to whether or not it'll get boring after extended play.Now for the actual Review:Duelyst is an excellent TCG-style strategy game which, unlike many other free-to-play games in this genre manages to handle microtransactions in a fair way.While there's a lot of cosmetic items such as emotes and re-skins available exclusively for cash, none of these give an advantage within the game.Card packs are available for cash but are simply a way to obtain cards slightly faster than through normal gameplay (and they're priced a little outside of the range of people with a ""I'll just buy 1000 packs to get every card"" mentallity), how quickly you can earn card packs through gameplay is dependant on how well you play, whether or not you decide to clear the single-player ""puzzle"" challenges, etc. Though you should be able to earn 2-4 packs per day if you play for 1-2 hours.after 2 hours of play I had enough ""spare"" cards to sell and buy any common or semi-common card I wanted.The game has a focus on player-vs-player matches as opposed to single player vs the AI (though this IS still an option), The matches are very strategic, though the escalating stats of higher-cost cards makes lower-cost cards near-useless after just a few turns, which makes matches more and more luck-based the longer they play out.Cards are split into 3 types: essentially these traditional TCG cards: units, equipment and spells.Matches take place on a grid, players summon units onto spaces within range of their hero or other units, each turn each unti may move up to 2 spaces and then attack an adjacent enemy.Equipment cards boost your hero in various ways, but have durabillity which is lost when your hero takes damage.Spell cards have various effects which directly affect the match, units, equipment, etc.Good bits:An retro graphical style with good animations and varied card designs.Not pay-to-win.Balanced starter decks and factions with unique strategies that give advantages to people that can plan and strategise as opposed to people with ""better"" cards.Bad bits:High-cost cards tend to be exponentially stronger than low-cost ones, making long matches lean in favor of whoever gets luckiest in drawing their highest cost cards.The cosmetic items in the cash shop are absurdly expensive for what they are.No ""story"" mode currently (the cards are filled with lore which seems wasted without a storyline to go with it)Overall 7/10 in its current state. Worth trying but many people will be put off by the lack of true single-player experience.			"

												Despite the only 1.2 hours put in this game on Steam, I played this game quite a bit before. Duelyst is a great all-around game. The graphics are very pleasing, with very nice character attacks and board a e s t h e t i c s. Additionally, there are more than enough cards to truly your deck your own, with more cards being added every update. The business model is great, as you don't need to purchase anything as gold for packs is given quite frequently, and you always get amazing pulls every pack. The crafting sysytem is also very fair, giving even new players the option to craft any deck no matter how early they are in the game. All around, this game is a very nice F2P, strategic card game.

Or don't ever bother and just play it for the fun it offers.Generous rewards, simple quests, inspiring pixel art, wonderful soundtrack.The devs say there's a mobile client coming sometime this spring, no further details atm.

												Okay.  I'm recommending this game because I love BUT there is a thing that I have to say.  This game is an 8/10.  The only problem I have with it is like any card game: its P2W.  HOWEVER, it's starter cards and first 1000 gold (10 packs) will be enough for you to get to at least high silver, low gold.  I got to gold way back when with a 1000 dust deck and only 3 legendaries.  So if you want an easy to get into card game, you are in luck.Now, the other point is coming from 1 thing.  The difficulty curve of the game.  It isn't like hearthstone where you have some RNG and some possitioning, this game is RNG and extreme possitioning.  So, if you like chess style games, then this is even better for you.Other than that, I recommend this game over Hearthstone for digital card games.  Not saying its perfect, no game is, but it's a damn good one to start and even play for free!  So if you like card games mixed with chess, play this game.			"

												I've never played any other card game growing up religiously except for Pokemon, I even bought the video game for Gameboy so I could play alone. Duelyst brings alot of that back to me. It's a pretty addictive experience and very newbie friendly it seems. From what I've seen, this isn't p2w and really is f2p*. Cosmetics come with a price as well as faster progression for cards but both can't be obtained for in-game currency that is easy to come by from winning or even losing. Skill trumps over cards as well making this a great tactical card game that costs nothing. The menu and layout of some things could be prettier and nicer looking as well as a chat option in-game would be a nice touch. Overall, this game is awesome. Played for hours and hours on day one.Overall : ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆*Non-p2w obviously can change in the future, I'm looking at you Maplestory.			"

												Duelyst it is “free to play” and NOT ""pay to win"", which is a major advantage.It is one of the best card games I have played. Some cards and mechanics are similar to Hearthstone, but the ""board"" with units and generals gives another layer to the game. It makes this game much more versatile many different approaches are viable. Obviously you won't get the perfect deck with basic cards, but:- It is relatively easy to get booster packs finishing the daily challenges- Gauntlet (similar to Arena in Hearthstone) makes you draw a random deck each time and it doesn’t depend on your own collection. This rewards you with guaranteed boosterpack and more.- The paid items are either pure cosmetics or booster packs which you can earn playing daily. Last but not least, the game has a great ""tutorial"" section that learns you basic mechanics while solving the ""one turn kill combos"".Disclaimer: I have played a lot of Duelyst before the steam version was avaliable.

												Duelyst is an interesting take on CCGs. It introduces a 9x5 grid, adding a new dimension of complexity onto the standard model. The resulting game is something like a blend of Hearthstone and Final Fantasy Tactics. Fans of both games will find comfort here. Units move across a board to combat other units, making positioning a key element to success. The units themselves have mechanics in accord with the standard CCG. As well as its unique gameplay, Duelyst features a distinctive art style. Hand-drawn portraits and landscapes are put alongside some of the most well-done pixel art I've seen. In terms of gameplay, Duelyst is quite accessible. Players spend in-game currency on card packs to build a deck. The gold acquisition rate is quite generous--players will find it fairly easy to earn a pack a day in about 45 minutes of play. Along with generous gold gain, the packs themselves are very charitable on drops. On average, a player can expect a Legendary (highest card rarity) in 1 of 4 packs. This alleviates the new player's problem of card scarcity, and encourages continuous play.			"

The actual game mechanics are a great blend of tactical and TCG elements, making it my favorite card game since Magic.			"

												Pretty good card game.The general metastrucuture is similar to Hearthstone in the way it is set up (type of ranking ladder, arena, monthly seasons, crafting instead of trading, etc).The game itself is a nice blend of basic card game mechanics and basic tactical mechanics. It actually flows really well and allows for skill to play a pretty big role. Some mechanics really help smooth the game out, like a free card cycling every turn.The Free-to-Play model is probably the most friendly one I've seem in a CCG. It feels like they make most of their money by selling cosmetics (card backs, player icons, emotes) instead of selling cards themselves. Quite doable to play this without spending anything.			"

												Duelyst is new and exciting and I put this down to a number of things:It's extremely well ballanced with only 1 or 2 meta strats prevailing and even then, they can be beaten. Some of that comes down to luck of the draw in who you play and what cards you have on hand.OP isn't a thing and there's always a way to win. Even the rarest cards only help you slightly more, they're half about improving decks and part about rewarding yourself with cool cards for doing well.The design is amazing and cards don't let you down. In-game skins are pricey but can be won through hard work or cheaper purchases of keys if you find chests.I easily logged 16 hours with my brothers over the last week trying to beat each other's monthly rank. Overall the game has a friendly competitive nature to it and is great to play at any time. It feels family friendly but mature and I hope that it stays ballanced and fun. The PVP is great, losing a battle to a deck that counters yours is frustrating but the next match you might edge the next guy. It's like a big rock paper scissors mixed with custom chess.P.S. PLEASE DONT DO A CARDS AND CASTLES!!! For me this game is top of it's league at the moment, beats all it's rivals and those that came before. "

												I've played a lot of these online card games. Legend in Hearthstone, Rank 1 in Elder Scroll Legends, Diamond in Eternal; and despite how fun some of those games were, none of them have matched Duelyst for me.Duelyst is probably the most visually attractive of any of the current online card games, and, at a glance, has one of the better UIs (which, if you've been playing online card games like I have, you'll recognize as a rarity for the genre.)I will note, I haven't been good at Duelyst (or even really played it) for around a year, so I don't feel comfortable commenting on balance. When I was heavy into it however (S Rank for a couple seasons) it was reasonably well balanced compared to other offerings of the genre, and well supported by the developer. Additionally the grind isn't as bad as Hearthstone (in my opinion, anyways), nor is it as dull as Eternal's endless march of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ commons before you get to anything useful.All in all, I would say Duelyst is one of the best, if not the best online card games out there right now.

A collectible tactics game whose rarefied mechanical design makes for fast-paced matches brimmed with strategic depth.Duelyst, Hearthstone and Scrolls (the Mojang game, not the Elder Scrolls one) would fight for a slot of my leisure time almost every other day. The battle is usually close but it is Duelyst that often comes out alive.The biggest problem with Hearthstone is that it is 70% deckbuilding and 30% actually playing. Once you build a deck, all you're doing in the match is following your deck's recipe. There are only a few meaningful decisions to make during a match. Most of the time you know within a few seconds what cards to play. Yes, predicting the composition of your opponent's deck and calculating the probabilities of your and your opponent's next card draw will increase the likelihood of you winning, but that much brain power yields diminishing returns. You could literally play the match drunk and still do reasonably well.Duelyst, on the other hand, makes playing the match as important as deckbuilding and the match itself is every bit as complex. Every turn in the match has many meaningful decisions, many options that actually changes the state of the game, many highly impactful choices that require proportionally high brain power for you to reveal them. Every turn is like a puzzle with a time-limit: Can you calculate the lethal before your turn ends? Was there even a lethal? Did you just allow your opponent to setup a lethal? The brain power you put into Duelyst matches does not yield diminishing returns as quickly as it does in Hearthstone. And what's even better is that the game is still easy to learn and the average match length hits the sweet-spot of 12 minutes (this statistic was taken from the dev and in my experience is true). Of course all this means you can't play Duelyst drunk the way you can play Hearthstone drunk and still do okay. So in that regard Hearthstone is better.Now on to Duelyst versus Scrolls. Duelyst's sweet-spot of 12 minutes is what makes it superior to Scrolls. Scrolls have positioning similar (ehh, somewhat) to Duelyst but also have a countdown based attack system where minions only attack after every X turn. Essentially this means there are two major indirect synergies, relative position and synchronized attacks, to worry about on top of the direct ones as defined on the cards themselves. Dude, this is a lot to take in! No wonder it takes 30 minutes to finish a Scrolls match. It would've been okay if the moment to moment happenings of those 30 minutes were interesting, but sometimes it feels like a drag. Duelyst, with positioning being the only major indirect synergy, does not feel this way. Despite this knock on Scrolls, its saving grace is that it has the greatest deckbuilding interface and feature set in a card game that I have ever seen. It makes deckbuilding an absolute joy. Duelyst unfortunately copied Hearthstone's terrible deckbuilding UX.To put all this in a nice equation: Duelyst > Scrolls >> Hearthstone.			"

Made more awesome with awesome sound effects, factions, replay system, art design. It's incredible.

Game gives plenty of chances to earn free Gold(ingame currency)- Since i am F2P I compared this with HS, Duelyst requires you to log in and play at least 1 up to 8 ggames daily for you to earn at near 1 booster pack(they may still need to change th actual prices of thier extra content)3. Drop rates are good, although the stats are a bit skewed since Duelyst can play 3 of the sme Legendaries the chances of them dropping are better4. It took me 2 weeks to reach Gold, 3 months Diamond, 5 months for S rank by just playing casually and playing all factions as I see fit. I did not make 1 good deck to get to the best at the start which I would say is the best way to learn this game5. Devs listen(sometimes late but they listen)  "

												This game started off fun and I crushed for the first week but as I got up to silver ranks the game just got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are extremely imbalanced cards that are purley better than some other cards, the factions are really imbalanced and your basically dead if you have to play against vanar. I'm quitting at this point because it's one loss after another and feels too luck based, if your going to win you'll probably be winning from turn one and if your going to lose your probably going to lose from turn 1. Once someone has the upperhand and if they have better cards they're going to win. Lack of skill in upper ranks and just luck based.			"

												All the addiction and strategy of YuGiOh or Magic, combined with a bit of chessboard.  Its fun and engrossing and you keep finding yourself wanting to play more to unlock more cards and develop a stronger army.  I'm reminded a tiny bit of Unholy War, one of my old time favorites, but it's not quite that.Its a game that does well everything it sets out to do... and its free!  Hard to argue with!I've clocked some 80 hours into the game in my first month of playing it.  Now, that's harder to judge time than most games, because that's not pure playing time, but also looking at all the cards available and editing your own decks... so its easy to sink a lot of casual reading time in.  Which is fine!I've seen some negative reviews complaining that the game is pay to win, and that's just not true.  Maybe if you want to be absolute top of the pack S+ tier pro level and compete with people that have been playing for two years, sure, but even the raw base cards are pretty good and dependable regulars that can carry you through the starting ranks of the game without much trouble.  The game is pretty generous with in-game currency and starter quests... it'll just give you a few free packs for playing through all the tutorial challenges and early easily achievable things.  After that, if you just play regularly, there's bonuses like first win of the day, win two games, welcome back bonus, and easy challenges like ""destroy five minions"" and ""do 40 damage"" that will very easily net you 100+ coins every two days or so, enough to easily buy another pack or attempt the gauntlet challenge.  And if you can get your skills up enough to participate and win in gauntlet mode, you earn even more cards and coins.  If you can make it to even the second game rank, you'll get free cards at the start of the month.  Plus, whatever cards you dont like you can grind up to make other cards.You can buy packs to speed things up, yes, but just playing will get you the same rewards in fairly short order.   After clocking in 40 hours on the game I tossed 10$ at it to get a few packs, but that was more to support the game I'd been enjoying  than anything else.... and the results of those packs were the same as what I'd been getting for free...  just a chunk of them all at once. I would have gotten the same rewards from just playing another two weeks.			"

												Turning into a cash grab. It's possible that this game is going through a bad phase as the last few updates seem to have created a luck based game with everyone only playing the over powered cards. It might be good again with balance changes, but it does not seem to be going that way. The strategy is lost while everyone jumps on the ""metagame"" bandwagon. Don't trust the time played here, I've been playing a lot more than that before it came to Steam.			"

Highly-polished collectable card game with a twist of Grid-based-Strategy-RPG mechanics. Has tons of cards to collect, and awesome pixel-art animated graphics.Tip for new players: Use a referral code to get 100 free gold. My code is losingstreak - Just click ""Friends"" on the bottom-right corner of the main menu, click on ""claim a friend's referral code"" and input losingstreak to get your 100 free gold. (only applicable if you have not yet played ranked/ladder)Pros and cons:Pros:+Not P2W: Gold is fairly easy to earn - making it fairly easy to advance and make a competitive deck without having to buy packs using real money+Six factions to play that each have their own unique strategies and skills +Faction-specific cards and tons of non-faction-specific neutral cards add a lot of variety and depth to deck-making+Draft mode that gives good rewards (similar to Arena in Hearthstone)+Much less RNG than Hearthstone (if you hate Yogg, you'll like this one)+Good music and awesome pixel-art animated graphics+Can reconnect if you disconnect mid-match; just don't take too long or the game will automatically concede for youCons:-Games can drag on especially if the enemy is turtling or roping-Practice duels with friends do not give any reward or progression-Cannot chat with other players in a match, you can only use preset emotes and quotesBonus Tips for free stuff:~Duel with a friend to get a one-time-only free pack~Play with each faction atleast once to get a free random-faction legendary card			"

												No unranked mode.  Every single class gets completely broken cards and then every other card is basicly trash to fill up your deck so that you win or lose completely depending on yoru oppening hand.  There is about one million removal or silence cards so unless you have a rush minion buffs are basicly a waist of your time.  No amount of smart play will ever win you a match becuase 9/10 of them just end in a cheese combo that unless you had 4 taunts around you was impossible to counter.

												Duelyst is definitely one of the strongest contenders in the wake of Hearthstone's invigoration of CCG video games. The addition of the positional component makes each game play out in more interesting ways (at least in the middle tiers). The ability to exchange a card every round and a fixed mana curve makes the game feel much more in your control. It also makes each match play out pretty quickly, making it easy to dip in for a quick game. The flip side is that it feels like the meta requires the decks to be very aggressively tuned to the curve in the higher ranks. The starter decks will quite easily carry you into silver rank, and you can craft many decent budget decks from wins, so there's no pay-to-win pressure like in some of the CCG clones popping up on mobile. Well worth checking out if you enjoy CCGs or customizable board games. "

												I only played a little, but seems great so far.The unit placement and movement on the grid adds alot to the game.You can also replay your matches which is a great feature.I also love the fact that you can't drop ranks. Once you reach a certain rank and lose you just stay on the same rank. If you win you progress to the next rank. That means I can play while not at my best form without worrying about dropping ranks.Overall, highly recommended.			"

												I LOVE what this game is trying to do, I love card games and I love tactical games so this should be great right?well, it is, each deck plays different and it even borrows heavely from hearthstone and relies on luck, but it also tries to minimize luck with some interesting redraw mechanics. Also, kind of like hearthstone, each deck plays a little bit different and that coupled ith the movement of the cards on the battlefield make from a very enjoyable game that it manages to feel fresh every time you switch decks.Did I mention it has card puzzles? I love puzzles, and this game has card puzzles, and they are pretty cool.So... why dont I recommend it? simple: like most collectible card games its nature is... 100% pay to win. The strategy side kind of balances things out at first, but not enough in my opinion. Also the way it tries to sell you things is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I dont mind buying card packs but why are there limited time cardpacks? why are there free boxes that require premium keys to unlock? why do you give them to me and then tell me that if I dont buy the key in 48 hours it dissapears?Also, besides rare cards that have incredible value, the balance between factions and even between leaders of the same faction leaves a little to be desired, but I cant hold that much against it.TL;DR: This is a fun game and I WOULD recommend you to try it out, but I dont recommend giving it a penny in its current state			"

												Find this review useful? Would greatly appreciate it if you would refer me! This referral code will also give you 100 gold! My code is ngelicdark - just click ""Friends"" on the bottom-right corner of the main menu, click on ""claim a friend's referral code"" and type ngelicdark to get your 100 free gold. (Only applicable if you have not yet played ranked/ladder).And to keep this review honest, I kickstarted Duelyst back in 2014. I was hoping to get a Fire Emblem-esque game but PvP. And I was greatly impressed back then as I am now. Actually, even moreso now.Now for the review:Pros:-It's a wonderful iteration of tactics style rpg combat made for a MMO audience. That is pretty darn rare considering the best PvP scenario with this type of gameplay was Fire Emblem or Advance Wars, and that was uncommon outside of Japan.-Easy to get into. Harder to master. That's right, there's depth to the combat mechanics!-The art was as beautiful and charming. It's a blend of pixel and something akin to cellshading. The music is also soothing and I find that the summon blips, swings, grunts to be spot on.-The devs are faithful, the devs work hard, and the devs listen. It's come a long way since alpha and beta back in the day. The new factions are balanced and the additional heroes to the factions are different enough to twist a general gameplay style.-F2P? Casual? No problem. The game is very generous with giving out gold and thus, cards (and it was a lot easier getting legs here than it was in Hearthstone) -Legs are not as influential as they are in HS. Most of them are not as efficient in terms of value as are lower cards. Plus, they tend to be higher mana cost cards, meaning you won't see 2 drops giving a good chunk of momentum with effects you can't mirror unless you own those cards.-Once a day daily puzzles. Do you remember ""checkmate in one turn"" puzzles? I do. I loved them as a kid. Still do now. And if you don't have the patience for it, then someone can easily give you the solution. But where's the fun in that?-Tight knit community. I find this a plus: if you need help, you can easily find it on the official forums as well as the subreddit. -The game feels balanced compared to other TCGs I've mingled with, IRL and online.-Disenchanting a leg for much needed dust early in the game to make basic decks is not as painful as it is in Hearthstone. For most, it's actually recommended.Cons:-It's still a collectible card game. If you tire of collecting packs then it's not your cup of tea.-There's a crate system in the game. You'll have a random chance of finding said crates after a game but you'll have to pay money in order to open them. It's only for cosmetics though so you're not missing much by not being able to open them.-UI seems a little clunky at first. I'm being nitpicky, but it bugs me when I have to buy cards in a different window in order to open said packs.Tips:-The Duelyst subreddit has a list of the hidden achievements available. Google it, thank me later.-Get all the factions to level 10. Don't focus on one. When you'll need to branch out later, you'll be hard pressed to compete with others of your ranking since you didn't get the second general unlocked or the extra copies of the common (and usually necessary) cards of the typical budget deck.And of course, hope to see more people join the ranks! I hope you guys enjoyed this review!			"

												Completely screwed over everyone who registered before the 15th of September by giving away a month's worth of card packs for free. Signed up when it released on Steam and have been playing since, or bought 20 dollars worth of cards a couple weeks ago? Too bad, you are now on par with someone who picked up the game yesterday and you can't get the free packs because reasons.			"

												DO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY AND TIME INTO THIS GAME. Voice of experience here. I've played a tremendous amount of competitive card games in my time. Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, Hearthstone, VS System, Pokemon, you name it.  NONE of them are as PAY TO WIN as this game.  I've climbed my way to about half way up the ranking system (by the way, EVERY pvp match in this game is ranked) and hit an absolute brick wall of people spamming hard to find super rares (purple and orange rares, think Mythic rares in Magic the Gathering) which there is little to nothing you can do about with a regular deck.  IF you can take out those creatures or counter the effects, it usually takes a 2-3 card combo to do so, which just puts you in a weaker position for next turn.  It's pathetic. I wish I had my time back.			"

												I thought I had left a review around 40 hours. My bad. Well this game can defintiely be time consuming, in a good way. There's many different ways to play and there's many different ways to build decks, even within the ways to play. The placement of your cards is also very important, which is usually looked over for many games from what I have seen. Since it's free to play, I'd just say download it and give it a whirl. It won't cost you anything except a bit of time, which you obviously have if you're reading reviews looking for a new game to play. The only downsides I really see are how expensive cards are to buy (in my opinion, based on the fact that it's a virtual card game with no real way to sale your assets back to cash), the fact that some opening hands are just unbeatable, no matter what you're playing or how many times you mulligan, and the balance issue of some cards. That last part is usually fixed my the dev's relatively quickly, which is another way of saying the dev's listen to the community and statistitcs of certain cards.			"

												In a nutshell duelyst is like chess played with cards.I'll make comparisons with hearthstone to better describe the main meat of the game. Please dont take this as ""duelyst is better"" or ""hearthstone is better"" , i think both games are very distinct and great experiences, while my point is that duelyst is really easy to get into and enjoy a wide variety of decks(gameplay). I wanted to emphasize on that fact, cause thinking of ""another huge investment phase to gather/collect before actually enjoying the game"" is what made me hesitate to try Duelyst.So, arena price and pack prices are the same as hearthstone, while;Legendary ratio is 1 on every 4 pack. Its 1 on 20 pack in hearthstone. (both numbers are taken from developer quotes)Cards are cheaper to craft, legendaries are like half the price relative to hs.You get 15 gold for every 2 wins, in hs you get 10 gold for every 3 wins.You get 2x 25 gold quest + a 5 gold puzzle everyday, in hs you get 1 quest worth 40 to 60 gold. (and 100 gold quest maybe once in a month)Arena is much more rewarding than hearthstone, like in 7 wins you get another free entry+2 cards+gold+dust+pack. I wont even explain hs counterpart, if youve ever played hearthstone you must be familiar with constant complains about arena rewards.You get more rewards at the end of seasons.You can get cosmetics/emotes/cardbacks/skins with ingame currency.With its non-existent ""invest first"" phase, cool different mechanics, basic decks that can actually rank up, Duelyst is a game that you can actually enjoy while mainly playing hearthstone or mtg etc. And one that you'll certainly love if you liked said games above.

												I wish I could give this somewhere between a yes and no. Because it's kind of close to being in the middle.On one hand, I really enjoy this game. It's fun. Tactical. Unique. No two games will play out the same. The community seems to be cool at least from the 3-4 people I actually added on this game after a match. There are a lot of cards. 6 factions, with every faction having two different 'generals' to use. Although, you don't get the alternate general until you reach level 10 with that specific faction. Which I've found is anywhere from 10-15 games, I think. The matches go fast. Maybe 10-15 minutes. The pixel art graphics are beautiful.On the other hand... This is, no joke, a straight up pay to win game. No different than things like Clash Royale, and I think Hearthstone did this too. I don't normally play p2w games, but I imagine it's all built off the same model. A system that is built to undermind the consumer with microtransactions for instant gratification. Basically there's no way to just dump a small sum of money into one specific thing to get what you want right then and there. It's completely built for the sole purpose of milking the living hell out of their players wallets. Your starting cards can MAYBE get you to rank 20 if you're patient enough, but beyond that in ""Silver Class"", it's full of people that have payed possibly hundreds of dollars for their insane decks. I won't lie, I got a little fed up facing people like this and bought a couple orb packs. Orbs are like ""chests"", you buy an orb for 100g, though 100g comes in very, very slowly. It's almost pointless. You can buy 1 orb for 2$, 3 for 5$, 7 for 10$, 15 for 20$ or 40 for 50$. Orbs are how you will grow your deck. When you open an orb, you'll be showed 5 floating gem/rock type things ranging from grey, blue, purple, and orange in color. Exactly what you would imagine them to be... Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary. Click on the floating thing and it reveals a card that's now yours. Most of the time you're getting commons and one rare. BUT HERE IS THE REAL KICKER!!! If you've grown fond of one specific faction (Like I have, Lyonar), all these cards are not for just your faction. They're for the other factions and sometimes neutral cards (Ones any faction can use). Trying to get cards for your specific faction is a nightmare and I've gone up to 9 (Yes, NINE) orbs without getting one single Lyonar card. Remember there's 6 factions, plus neutral. So at anytime 1-2 factions are guaranteed getting shisted when it comes to opening an orb. Which brings me to a bit of a tin-foil-hat theory.. I know games like this have algorhytims in them to drastically lower the chance-rate in which you actually get the items you need/want based off of what you already play. I know Clash Royale is guilty as all hell for it, and I'm pretty sure this one is too. The only custom deck I have is a Lyonar because it's all I play, but in the 70$ I've put into this game, Lyonar cards came in at such a noticeably low rate compared to every other faction that it really leaves a bad taste in my mouth about the developers. They just want you to spend more to TRY and get a couple of those cards you'd like for your deck.Bottom line/tl;dr - If you have a high amount of disposable income and can blow away hundreds to be able to actually compete, then try it out. It is fun.. If you don't want to put money into a game, but want to climb the ranks, look for another game. This is not the one for you. If you're at all on the fence about p2w (pay to win) games, look else where...I'll probably still play it from time to time, but the p2w aspect of it all really just kills the game for me.			"

Yes, gameplay is rather innovative. Yes, devs are not greedy.But balance is ♥♥♥♥ed.

												This game looks cool and its promissing, but when you get Silver rank 15 its starts to be pure PAY TO WIN.Everything in the game is expensive. It takes you a whole day to get one crapy new card, and you can only get gold if you win, and do you win after Silver? Hardly, because all high ranks freaking buy cards with real money. To get good cards like them you would need like 6 - 8 months playing 14 hours a day non-stop.Do not fool yourselves. This is a Freemium game.The developers must think that they need to place a price tag in everything so they can make money, but if they really wish to suceed with this game they need to stop forcing players WHO DONT WANT TO SPEND MONEY TO SPEND MONEY TO WIN. You want to charge players for something? Charge them for skins, icons, emotes, effects and stuff, other than that just stop. Because you are ruinning 50% of the players experience.Overall, you guys should at least try this game, and after a week playing it you will understand what I am saying.Positive aspects of the game:  *Reminds of Poxnora, but 16bit style. *Very sharp design *Different types of deck builds *Different types of Generals *Quick matchmaking The Dark Side of the game:FREAKING FREEMIUM PAYTOWIN AFTER A WEEK GAMEPLAY100% EXPENSIVE STORENEEDS MORE CARDS AND GENERALS (Duelyst looks like a Beta game)CARDS NEED TO BE BETTER BALANCED OR HAVE RESTRICTED USAGE TO CERTAIN RANKS			"

												Most pay-to-win game I've ever played - it's nearly impossible lategame to counter the slew of rare cards players threw money at to acquire, and the common-quality cards acquired through grinding incur an urge to buy rarer sets to keep up with the competition. The price for each card pack is pure greed; I'm not even guaranteed the normal cards I need to complete a competitive deck since each pack is random, which makes paying $50 for a 40 even more ridiculous. Unbalanced cards are supposedly randomly dropped, but the chances are incredibly slim. Don't give money to these guys. They don't deserve it after failing to balance gameplay with monetary gains.

												The long and short of it - I've tried this game on two different occasions and it's not balanced at high level play. Or maybe it is, but everyone has to either play the same amount of time or buy in the same amount. When everyone is using the starter decks, it's fine. On several occasions, people pull these low cost cards that are absolutely devastating (one was a summon 4 random faction minions - they each were 4-5 cost cards for the price of one 4 cost card. The other is a 3 cost card that gives a general +2 attack whenever anyone on their side takes damage. That should be like a 6-7 cost card, as it is game ending.) I never got into crafting, as to do it efficiently, you would need to dump money into the game.I feel like the deck drawing phases have some awful RNG to them, as well. You can have 25 unique cards in your deck and fairly consistenly draw the same cards without ever seeing some of what you put in your deck. How hard is it to randomly assign all deck cards a number and order them for true randomness? Or would that break the faulty design of the game?All in all, I like the effort, but balance is poor which really impinges on the fun factor. It's free, though, so you'll probably get around 10-15 hours of enjoyment out of it at no cost.			"

												Disapointing game offering no hook at the start. the tutorial (if you can call it that) is horrible featuring little insight into the way the game actually plays and even forcing you to make plays that suggests certain mechanics don't work the way they do. When you unlock a new faction their cards are just splashed across the screen with no way to ready them there. I receive one orb (card pack) in my time play that I wasn't even awere of. The gameplay itself is so simplistic for the first few games that playing anymore to see if fun mechanics appear is a chore I won't bother with even if you could gaureentee a great result. The most off putting part is the art deciesons. The minions themselves are pixel, and not very good pixel art at that. The backgrounds and characte art is very one drawn and not pixel-ly in the least. The contrast of these two styles does help it the game, it just makes it into a visually jumbled mess.			"

												BASE ON MY EXPERIENCES WHICH MIGHT NOT BE LIKE YOURS...  I know this won't get treated fairly either, but it's the truth and how I felt...The game can be fun, but without spending money you lack the competitive edge needed to win, even if you are really good.  I created a couple accounts and asked around to test some theories on this & that and found that after 5 wins in a row things changed drastically, the matches went from starter deck vs starter deck to me (starter deck) vs a full Epic and legendary decks (money spent well)  So I would say DUELYST can be tons of fun, but more for the very non-competitive-casual style of player for F2P.  True buying spirit orbs still grant rewards by random rolls, but spend enough and anything is possible.I can't totally claim 100% P2W, due mainly that I was able to beat a little more than half of the impossible money decks and also that is it possible to advance otherwise, but at a very grindy-slow speed.The pixel graphics didn't bother me and the horrible RNG didn't either, what did bother me is the support team.  They make it torture to delete your account and they send you newsletters even when you have it setup to not send notifications and other information + ads.  They were allowing to change email and have a free Name Change, but the change email poofed and this led to me wanting to delete account.  I should not have to be forced to make another  email just so they don't use  my email.  I am leaving a bit of conversations back and forth out of this, but I am sure you get the point.The Game & Mechanics = 7/10  :steamhappy:  ""It is a fun concept""The Support Team rating = 1/10 :steamsad:   ""without a good support team lost trust""I decided it was best to uninstall at this time...  Combat monsters is an other silly version of this same genre setup, has more PvE and is way easier, but the PvP is almost non-existant.  For now I will promote how the support is horrible.FINAL NOTE:    SUGGESTIONAllow account deletion in settings--Thanks!--			"

												I cannot recommend this game anymore.Over the last few month the developer has gradually made the game less and less player friendly by nerfing the in-game currency rewards multiple times and also the drop rates from booster packs. Unless one is willing to sink a large amount of either time or money into the game, advancing the card collection is painfully slow and one is hardly able to keep up with the release of new cards resulting in an infinite grind treadmill for casual players.Due to this player numbers over the last months have been on a constant decline, at the time of this review a measly 300-500 concurrent player, and unless the developer turns things around quickly this game is bound to vanish into obscurity.There are better F2P card games out there like Shadowverse that actually value your play time and have a larger chance of still being around in a couple of years.

												I have been playing this game for about two months now and wow i am blown away by it. It is extremely addictive and rewarding.Gameplay: Perfectly balanced between easy to learn but hard to master, i found mysdelf climbing high up the ladder with a budget deck but as i got higher and i was playing against better people i really needed to start learning some strategies and gradually replace cards in my deck with better ones.Each game feels different and requires a certain amount of thinking and strategy.The tile system is very easy to learn and every general and deck type are very different to eachother, each are unique and their core cards are also very unique.Pay to win?: no this game is no where near pay as hearthstone is, i found myself spending minimal and still being able to be competetivivce, i have heard countless stories of people reaching the highest rank with just a budget 0$ cost deck. People in the reviews that are claiming this game is pay to win are most likely players who keep losing and are blaming their own shortcomings on the opponents"" better cards"". People will complain about anything instead of blaming themselves.If you would like to start up this game which i would highly recomened, use my refer code ""Trebs"" and you can add me on my buddy list and i can teach you.10/10			"

												Mostly playing starter decks. People concede when I'm about to beat their fancy deck. Don't let others fool you when they say, ""You can only win when you buy better cards with cash"". Starter deck can get you quite a way down the ladder since I tend to get to rank 15 or 14 and then I just kinda get a mix of wins and losses.I say Duelyst actually made pretty good starter decks since some games tend to make awful ones.Other than that it's a pretty fun game to play,just kinda spoils it when people concede before you do the finishing blow.You don't really need the crates since they just offer emoticons and foiled cards.

Its a very similar to magic the gathering in the sense that you'll make a deck with a single purpose, but decks arent everything. Poitioning ans strategy are key. You have to defend your general while putting presure on the enemy. You can simply rush them but thats a gamble, and certain decks are impossible to rush against. Its an amazing strategy tcg that I would highly recommend, at least to try after all it is free!			"

												Duelyst is the best digital CCG I have played. It isn't quite perfect, but it makes Hearthstone look like the highly polished turd that it is.The Good:+ Pixel art with killer animations!+ Six very different factions with interesting playstyles. Balance isn't quite there yet, but there isn't just one strategy that outright shatters everything else.+ Tactics! Having a grid makes strategy all the more important to play efficiently and intelligently. Place one card in the wrong spot or make the wrong move and boom! You're in hot water and either losing tempo or the match.+ Definitely not P2W. Sorry salt farmers, you can play a reasonable amount every day and amass a good collection. You can easily earn a pack a day, maybe more if you are dedicated. And if you look on Reddit, you can get help building low dust (currency to create cards) cost decks that can totally flex with the expensive ones.+ If you do start paying, you get rare cards at an elevated rate compared to Hearthstone. Add in a more favorable disenchant rate and lots of high quality staples at common and you won't break the bank on this game by any means.+ The playerbase and community (I played a ton in February-March approximately, so I'm not as up to date) is very friendly and helpful. I'm pretty sure most of us just want to see Duelyst grow and improve.+ Finally, replacing. Once per turn you can throw a card back into your deck and draw a new one. It adds that subtle amount of consistency that makes the game less of a variance fest. There are way fewer games where you just don't see your deck's key components.+ Daily challenges! Little bites of brain-teasing single player. Worst case scenario, The Meh:~ Crates are sorta lame. I mean, what is this? TF2?~ RNG additions lately are a little worriesome, but thus far it's nowhere near as offensive as Hearthstone. Fingers crossed it stays under control.The Bad:-NothingAll in all, if you like CCGs and strategy games you need to give this sucker a shot. After all, what's to lose? Oh, right... your social life.9/10			"

												I always liked Hearthstone for its gameplay, but could easily lose interest with nothing but digital card art and flashy effects to look at for long periods of time.  With the added dimension of a chess-like playing field, it increases the tactical complexity that you cannot have with most basic card games.  I don't know if my attention span will allow me to play forever, but so far so good.  This game has quality art, and feels balanced enough to not dissuade a person to give up easily.

												I fully reccommend this game.It is a tactical, turn-based game and a card game. You use the cards to place units to the board, cast spells and equip your general with artifacts. Mechanics - The objective of the game is to kill the enemy general. Each round you have an increasing amount of mana to play your cards. There are 3 game modes: Practice against a basic AI, Season Ladder which is the ranked PVP and the Gauntlet, where you build a deck from scratch. There are endless possibilities of combinations with the cards and the board positioning. You can choose among 6 factions, each one having 2 generals with different playstyles.Matches last around 10 minutes.Aesthetics - The quality of the artwork is AAA. Unit design and animation are superbly well done in a pixel art style, backgrounds are beautiful paintings. The soundtrack is great and the interface is beautiful, functional and responsive.Dynamics - I found the game very noob-friendly (even having zero experience on card games), the tutorial covers the basics and gets you up and running very fast. There are dozens of challenges that show combos and the basic mechanics from every faction.You have so many cards to unlock and so much to rise on ladder that it guarantees endless, high quality entertainment for free.Community - So far, incredibly good. People tend to be nice and helpful. There are several great streamers that help with insights and tips, also, lots of content across different platforms - wiki, reddit, twitter.Conclusion - Definitely worth a try if you are into tactical, cards or both. A very well crafted game, with constant challenges, endless room to grow, healthy playerbase and friendly community. "

												Duelyst is a beautiful amalgamation of classic card games like Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone and hex-based strategy games such as Final Fantasy Tactics and less specifically, the newer XCOM games. Developed by Counterplay games, smooth animations and a crisp and pleasing pixel art style give Duelyst a level of polish that very few free-to-play games have. The game has been available through an individual launcher up until yesterday when it was released on Steam, hopefully giving this game a much deserved boost in the player base. Being free-to-play hopefully won't turn off many collectible card game players because, well, most digital CCG's are free-to-play. Unlike most, however, Duelyst is very generous with its booster packs, called Spirit Orbs. I received tons of them when I started playing that gave me a great collection of cards to build off of. Single Orbs will cost you 100 gold, which is plentiful as like as you complete all of your daily quests and can win a couple of games against real players every now and then.You have your traditional Hearthstone style mana system, gaining one permanent mana every turn. Combat is as smooth as a whistle. After your summoned minions, that can be summoned within a few tiles of your general (think as if your Hearthstone hero was a 2/20 card itself), are rid of their summoning sickness, they can attack in any direction within a certain tile radius. minions who are attacked, counter attack just like almost any other CCG out there. Duelyst truly sets itself apart from these other CCG's with the added strategy and almost puzzle like layer. Ranged minions, who can attack anything from any spot on the board, are just one of the ways the game uses the play field in an effective and fun way. Provoke is another mechanic that does such a thing, adding a taunt-like mechanic in which no minions in the minion with provoke's radius can move or attack without first destroying said minion. Teleporting minions to any spot on the board is yet another way Duelyst creates fun and different ways to use it's mechanics.I mentioned earlier a puzzle aspect that Duelyst presents. While regular PVP games don't seem to give you the feeling of a puzzle game, the daily challenge, as well as Solo Challenge mode, is absolutely, in and of itself, a puzzle. The board is set the same every time you retry the challenge and your goal is to move minions and use mechanics in a certain way and order to kill the opposing general in one turn. Solo Challenge mode includes 6 sets of 5 challenges, each one more difficult than the last. This mode is sure to give even the sharpest of players at least a few hours of gameplay. Card rarity will look familiar to any CCG player: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. With each orb containing 5 cards, with at least one rare, you will find yourself with more rare or better cards than normal. Epic cards tend to show up every two orbs and legendaries one in every four. This may seem high, but when you can have 3 copies of a legendary in a deck, along with 3 copies of any other card, it's easy to see why Duelyst is so generous with its rare cards. Deckbuilding is very fun with tons of mechanics you can build around. A Golem based deck built around Golem Vanquisher, which gives your other golems provoke, ranged decks that buff your ranged minions to ping down the opposing general, or a deck that is designed to try and OTK (one turn kill) your opponent, are just a few of the near infinite decks you can build, provided you have the cards for it.With 10% of the proceeds of all pre-orders of the upcoming expansion Denizens of Shim'zar, which will add more than 90 new cards to the collection, going towards the prize pool for the Duelyst World Championship, I'm sure the pro scene is about to bustle and explode.While I just spent the last 700 words or so gushing over the game, I struggle to play more than 4 or 5 games at a time. I would love to lose an entire day or weekend to this game as I do to other CCG's, grinding out gold and wins on the ladder, I just can't. The game is mentally exhausting, which is absolutely not a bad thing. It makes you think more than most games which is a definite plus to most people. It's my weak mind that's the problem. With it's recent release on Steam, coupled with the fact that it is free-to-play, I would be on the look out for this game to explode in popularity very soon. Counterplay Games seem to have their priorities set straight and have content lined up for a while, including a second expansion in the works and four new cards added to the core set every month. Give Duelyst a try. You will not be disappointed. Plus, its free, so why not give it a chance?http://www.blaiseplays.com/blaise-plays/duelyst/ "

												In-depth game that requires skill and tactics. Pretty much Hearthstone chess, but without the bull of Hearthstone. Cards are easy to obtain. You can quickly build a deck in the timespan of a week or two. Thats about the time it takes to learn the ins and outs of the game.Also unlike Hearthstone, there is a movement system, which allows for much greater usage of tactics and diversity. Even halfway decks can compare to the stronger decks, as long as good strategy is used. Also very different to Hearthstone, which is full of RNG bull and meta decks. There are so many ways to play this game. Every faction has two Generals (similar to HS classes, but with TWO :D ). Each has their own ability to help their minions or themselves. Or hurt the enemy. Factions have specific cards and abilities unique to them, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are also neutral cards that anyone can use.Deck building is very creative. You can do anything (mostly) and get away with it. Do you wanna make a deck focusing on taking out the enemy general with the pure brute force of yours? Maybe you want to play dirty and lure enemies into well placed traps. Or you could just make a giant army of 1/1 minions. Possibilities are endless. Unlike Hearthstone...			"

												I put up with the clashing artstyle for a long while for the sake of the gameplay, but many of the most recent additions added towards making the game a case of Rock-Paper-Scissors between the decks instead of duels of wit and outmanouvering your opponent. If you are playing a Magmar deck with rebirth minions and go up against an Abyssian with all the new cheap Shadow Creep you might as well concede. A Magmar that casts the four mana RNG fiesta that gives you four random eggs in random spots of the map either demands an immediate cheap AOE that few decks run in your deck or spells an immediate concede. The limited hand size initially encouraged players to play to their deck's strengths while also allowing some choice tech cards thanks to the 2-draw mechanic but it has since been replaced with single draw, removing much of the consistency and what made the game fun - you are no longer rewarded for adding a few tech cards to rapidly cycle into and rather punished for not having three of every important card in your deck. What was initially a game of limited RNG reached the point where the newest expansion Denizens of Shim'zar is full of pets that will choose randomly who to attack between two adjacent foes - which can be either game-winning or crippling. It hit me that this is just no longer the game I was having fun with when I downloaded it off steam one full year ago.			"

												This game is by far the best card game available.The only thing I dislike is that Lyonar is exceptionally gay/Overpowered. He basically has no weakness. Plz reel in some of the strenth of his cards, so that people playing with him can focus more on his strengths, also people playing against him can focus on a weakness he might have..edit: After a lot more games I have come to the conclusion that this system is way too obvious in what it does.You either win so easily that you cant possibly gain any enjoyment from the game. Or you lose in a way that makes you question God (he has answered, Its not him).Yes, you do get the balanced games that are exceptionally fun, But those only happen about 30% of the time, Which is just not worth it in my opinion. If it is not the system, Then this game has managed to deliver impossible odds time and time again. I am packing away my decks.Continuing my search for a fun skill based game..			"

												If you're looking for a great strategy game or card game, this is your best bet. I played a lot of HS but ultimately got burned out between the grind, legendary requirements, RNG, and lack of skill depth.Duelyst delivers all of the above and more. A great mix of cards and chess like strategy means that a good deck helps, but even as a new player, I've beaten ""better"" decks (legendaries, etc) just because of good positioning and maneuvering. The strategy requirements often make a loss feel better, too, where you really get why you lost as opposed to feeling like you lost due to RNG like in other games.This game really is F2P, and a generous one at that. Just by doing the daily challenges, quests, and so on you can easily net a few packs a day to quickly build up your deck.As a whole, I've spent way more than 6 hours in the game and haven't regretted any of it. Awesome community, too! Worth trying it out.			"

If you are playing a Magmar deck with rebirth minions and go up against an Abyssian with all the new cheap Shadow Creep you might as well concede. A Magmar that casts the four mana RNG fiesta that gives you four random eggs in random spots of the map either demands an immediate cheap AOE that few decks run in your deck or spells an immediate concede. The limited hand size initially encouraged players to play to their deck's strengths while also allowing some choice tech cards thanks to the 2-draw mechanic but it has since been replaced with single draw, removing much of the consistency and what made the game fun - you are no longer rewarded for adding a few tech cards to rapidly cycle into and rather punished for not having three of every important card in your deck. What was initially a game of limited RNG reached the point where the newest expansion Denizens of Shim'zar is full of pets that will choose randomly who to attack between two adjacent foes - which can be either game-winning or crippling. It hit me that this is just no longer the game I was having fun with when I downloaded it off steam one full year ago.			"

												This game is by far the best card game available.The only thing I dislike is that Lyonar is exceptionally gay/Overpowered. He basically has no weakness. Plz reel in some of the strenth of his cards, so that people playing with him can focus more on his strengths, also people playing against him can focus on a weakness he might have..edit: After a lot more games I have come to the conclusion that this system is way too obvious in what it does.You either win so easily that you cant possibly gain any enjoyment from the game. Or you lose in a way that makes you question God (he has answered, Its not him).Yes, you do get the balanced games that are exceptionally fun, But those only happen about 30% of the time, Which is just not worth it in my opinion. If it is not the system, Then this game has managed to deliver impossible odds time and time again. I am packing away my decks.Continuing my search for a fun skill based game..			"

												If you are looking for a good alternative and a better game than Heartstone this is one for you.Game is similar to Mojang's Scrolls but with a board where you can place minions to your oponnent side of board to.Gold is easy to get for buying new packs (orbs).  There are interesting and fun daily challenges and quests (for example: play 4 games with that faction, deal 40 damage in a match etc). Easy to learn. Matches dont last long. You cant trade cards (which is not a neagtive thing). You have an Arena mode as well. Most important: its fun. Definetly try this! 10/10			"

												I'm not at all a fan of ""the chase"" portion of card games, where you spend time acquiring cards to improve your decks. This leaves the draft or other game modes in terms of holding my intersest. Having a board on which to move and place your units allows Duelyst to have a cool puzzle mode where the player is given a board and they need to find out how to win in 1 turn, however most cards are designed with a very narrow set of situations in which they are powerful making these puzzles mostly about reading the cards and sequencing plays optimally as opposed to thinking about different ways to use the cards. The draft mode isn't amazing either because this same situationalness makes it so that it's very rare to see much broad synergy between cards making it feel mostly like an exercise in picking the most valuable card weighted for the curve you've already picked. Even in constructed, the situationalness means that punishes and advantage swings are extreme making the overall game more about tempo than anything else.However, for those who like that extreme feel to a game, it's pretty successful at being a game of skill expression. The reason I have decided not to recommend this game is because I perceive that cohort that would enjoy this game to be a fairly small niche of players.			"

												I thoroughly love Duelyst.  From the art, to the strategy, to the expertly crafted balance between RNG and skill, this is perhaps the game I've been waiting for since I first started playing Magic 20 years ago.  Allow me, for a moment, to take you through a journey of why I love this game.Skip this paragraph if you don't care to stroll through memory lane and just want to hear about Duelyst.  I love card games and I love board games.  Years ago there was a game called Culdcept that came out for the PS2 that was a hybrid between CCGs and Monopoly.  I played the hell out of that game.  It was a great concept that allowed a bit of strategy, but still tempered by dice rolls and luck draws.  There were still plety of times that you just couldn't draw the right card even though you have several of them in your deck, or you rolled the dice poorly and ended up on your opponent's equivalent to Boardwalk, but it was fun.  Duelyst reminds me a lot of Culdcept, only more positives and fewer negatives.In Duelyst, you start with your general and a handful of cards.  Those cards could be creature or spells.  Your general is effectively just like any other creature, only s/he has a whole lot of life.  The concept is simple: kill the opposing general before yours is killed.  The generals move and attack like creatures on a rectangular board.  You can summon creatures to any space next to any space you already control (ie, next to your general or one of your creatures), and creatures start with summoning sickness.  You draw one card at the end of your turn, and you can replace a card in your hand with a card off the top of your deck at the beginning of your turn.  Resources are handled like Hearthstone: +1 resource every turn.  And that, in a nutshell, are the rules.My favourite aspect of Duelyst is your ability to manipulate the board and your own hand.  For me, there's just enough RNG mixed with skill to keep me interested and not frustrated.  It feels pretty awesome to lure your opponent into a false sense of security by letting your health run low, then when they're one turn from the kill, you turn it around and burn them down from full health to 0 because they overextended.  Or when you take a look at your hand, knowing that you have one, maybe two turns left in the game and making that risky replace that pays off and gives you the win.  In Duelyst, I almost always feel like I had to earn my victory or my opponent simply outplayed me.  I can almost always look back at games I lost and see where I could have played better.  That sense of frustration that the cards weren't there for me rarely occurs, just that I should have played the cards I was given differently.  Easy to play, hard to master.P2W  Lots of people worry and argue about whether or not a F2P game is P2W.  It's a stupid argument for a CCG.  More cards equals more options when building your deck.  Some of those options are going to be powerful, some are not, but it's invariably better to have a variety of options than no options, and when you pay money you will have more options.  Does that make it P2W?  Well, here's what I can say about my experience so far with Duelyst.  I haven't put in any money whatsoever.  I've done daily quests and little more, however I played a LOT of Duelyst in the Alpha so I have a very strong understanding of the game mechanics, as well as different deck ideas that work and are relatively easy to make that rely on commons and rares and few to zero epics or legendaries.  I am currently rank 9 (gold, relatively high) and am starting to see the barrier where having more cards to choose from would help.  Keep in mind, there are a ton of common and rare cards that I don't even have yet due to my relatively small amount of playtime since the release.  I haven't even crafted any cards because I feel like carfting commons and rares would be a waste for later, so I'm just trudging along at a steady pace.  That being said, I am beating a lot of players that have much larger collections than I do.  I know this since several of them have a ton of ribbons (100+ wins with that faction), as well as cards that only unlock based on how many other cards you've collected (I have none of these), but that is not preventing me from playing and winning.  So is Duelyst P2W?  When you start getting higher up in the rankings, you won't be able to beat the players that have access to all the cards AND are skillful players.  But being a skillful player with few cards is more important than having all the cards and not being a skilled player.  So no, that legendary that stomped your face last game is probably not the only reason you lost.  You probably have more learning to do.I am going to be putting money into Duelyst because I love this game and I want to support the developers, but even if you don't put any money into it, there is a lot of enjoyment to be had here.  I would recommend everyone to at least try it because you have nothing to lose and there is an amazing game here with a lot of depth.			"

												Great game with thought provoking strategy. I was a big fan of Hearthstone since it came out but currently I am having more fun with Duelyst. The ability to place your minions on a game board and move them around adds a whole new level of tactics. This game is also more generous with giving out in-game currency. The pixel art graphics are really cool and the colors in this game are vivid and beautiful. Highly recommended if you are getting burnt out on the Hearthstone randomness.			"

												Before reading this, just take into consideration that I suck at card games. Deck building is something I've never been able to get the grasp of. That being said, Duelyst is a fantastic card / tactics game. It has a beautiful pixel aesthetic (not dissimilar to Dungeon of the Endless) with a lot of style and great animations. But how does it play? Well, it plays great. You choose one of 6 factions, all of which have 2 generals (one default and one alternate one that you have to unlock). The general is you. If the general dies, you lose. After you choose your faction, you can either choose a default deck or create your own. You can unlock individual cards from leveling up or you can buy booster packs with in game currency as well as real life currency if you want.The cards are where the game gets quite interesting. Each faction has its own unique set of cards as well as a 7th neutral set of cards that all factions can use. The cards are divided into minions, spells, and artifacts. Minions are summons that you can place on the battlefield. The minions themselves have TONS of variation. There are the average tanks, melee damage dealers, and ranged minions, but there is so much more to it than that. Many minions have abilities. Some have abilities that proc when you play the card. Some have abilities that proc when the minion dies or when other minions die. Some have abilities that proc at the end of your turn. I think you get the point. There's a lot of abilities.Spells are one time use cards that create some effect. Like minions, quite a lot of variation here. You have spells that heal or do damage, spells that buff, and a lot of other random stuff. Artifacts are similar to spells, except they usually just buff your general in some way. The artifacts are mostly unique to each faction with each faction basically serving as this game's version of a class. Each faction focuses on different styles of play.When you have built your own deck of 40 cards or decide to use the default deck, you go into a 1v1 battle. The battlefield is a grid, with each general automatically placed at either end. The battlefield is big enough to allow evasive maneuvers, but small enough to prevent people from totally running away from battle.Each player takes turns casting their cards and moving their generals and minions around. Each card has a mana cost which leads to deep strategy. You have to do your math or your turns may not end up as planned. The person who starts second has 1 extra mana point to make up for the fact that they move second. This is the game. You take turns going back and forth, casting your cards until one of you kills the other's general. One thing I absolutely adore is how attacking works. Unless the minion or general is ranged or some other buff/debuff comes into play, your melee attacks are met with counter attacks. That's right, you cannot melee attack without the enemy hitting you right back! This creates tension that leads to high strategy.The real fun in this game is learning the intricacies of each faction. The variation in playstyles is quite impressive considering there are only 6 factions to choose from. Each faction feels very unique. Test them all out and i guarantee you will fall in love with one of them. They're all very clever and have advantages and disadvantages. Although, you can sort of disregard the faction system altogether by using a lot of neutral cards instead.This game is very strategic and A LOT of fun. It's free to play, but I would gladly pay to play this if it weren't. If you like card games or tactics games, you've got nothing to lose! Give it a try. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do.			"

Millions upon millions of people have a smart phone in their pocket. If you want to increase your revenue, go Mobile. I want to see this game succeed in popularity so we can continually recieve new and exciting content!I have no qualms that the developers decided to make the in game units sprites. Since their isn't a large amount of graphically intennsive art going into unit design, we will get more content more often because an indie company can only afford to hire so many prorammers and art designers.

												Everyone is talking about how balanced the game is and how various tactics can be applied and so on.For me its the artwork of the game that caught my eye - colourful, vibrant and creative. Then there is the lore of the Duelyst World, deep and filled with great segments that describes how the various factions and monsters(that you use in the game as cards) came to be.Till now Morgan Freeman was the best narrator in my opinion and most people would agree on that but after listening to the lore, I must say Mr. Freeman has got some competition.

												TL;DR- I would strongly suggest anyone to give this game a try. Even more so if you enjoy games which require strategy and tactical positioning. A free game which is not P2W, and starts you with a viable cardbase for early levels. Relatively easy to get the cards you want through grinding.For a bonus 100 gold, which is worth a pack, (and to help me out, if you found my review helpful), make sure to use my Steam username as your referral code under the settings menu before you enter any ranked match!The long:I've been playing Magic: The Gathering for years. Tried out other games with moderate amusement.Even the Magic Duels game here on Steam has been kind of mediocre. I haven't picked it up since I stopped playing it. Tried out Hearthstone briefly and could not stand it at all, even if it did have some good gameplay elements.This game takes the good gameplay elements that Hearthstone employs and does it better, and puts it on a board. The board is always the same, so you always know what you're getting into, starting as first player or second player randomly. Where it really shines is in the emergent tactical development of each game which could only be possible with a board. There are also game mechanics which are only possible with a board. Deck building may be king, but positioning is god. You will win or lose a game sometimes purely based on how you move around the board or where you position things. Attack order is also important. Your moves should be planned, and sometimes a situation is so delicate that you will either win that turn or kill yourself by trying, that same turn, or lose immediately the next turn. And it's always your fault.Finally, they did a good job of reducing the effect RNG has on your options in your hand by allowing you to re-draw two cards from your starting hand before the match begins, and then every one of your turns allowing you to re-draw one card. It doesn't sound like much, but this is a game-changer and game-saver. It would be a very different game if you couldn't do this. Also, there are some cards which change this mechanic (like giving you an extra replace each turn) or activate based on it (do something every time you replace a card).Additionally, its gold-for-packs system and gold generation rate, as well as the rate for disenchanting and enchanting for card creation is much more generous than other games which use a similar system, such as Hearthstone. It's fairly easy to get most cards you want. I recommend creating commons and rares to fill out your neutral cards and faction you want to play to start with, before you try crafting epics or legendaries.			"

												Have you been trying to scratch an itch that only card games with the depth of MTG could scratch?  Look no more.  Duelyst is a competitve card-game with tactical-RPG elements similar to Final Fantasy Tactics.  The pixel art is great to look at, and the animations are fluid and good-looking.But perhaps what I enjoy most about Duelyst is that it's one of the first F2P games that's not forcefully shoving micro-transactions down your throat.  A lot of the micro-transactions are cosmetics: different skins, emotes, and in-game messages.  And yes, you can buy Spirit Orbs (Duelyst's booster packs) without using real money.The Practice and Challenge mode do a fantastic job at getting the player familiar with different skills and playstyles of all the generals.  The online mode is strictly competitve, and has a ranking system similar to League of Legends or Dota 2.There are a few things I would urge the developers to change.  Certain playstyles require the summoning of many minions, and the online game mode is set with a fixed timer.  I've found myself running out of time much more frequently than other similar games, which is definitely a problem for a game that relies so heavily upon strategy and placement.All in all, Duelyst is a fantasticly challenging game with a wonderfully unobtrusive F2P model.  I have yet to purchase anything, and have sunk over 20 hours so far.  However, I can easily see myself putting some money into the game, especially with the release of the new expansion set.  If more games would adopt a similar model, I would be much more willing to spend more time and resources on them.I'd urge anyone fond of MTG or tactical-RPGs to give Duelyst a try.  It's free, so you really have nothing to lose.			"

The art in this game is awesome, but some might not like the pixel character sprites when in battle. It's free so give it a chance if you like strategy games.			"

It's fantastic! They mixed a game like Hearthstone with Final Fantasy Tactics. I highly recommend the developers cross platform to IOS and Android like Hearthstone did. Millions upon millions of people have a smart phone in their pocket. If you want to increase your revenue, go Mobile. I want to see this game succeed in popularity so we can continually recieve new and exciting content!I have no qualms that the developers decided to make the in game units sprites. Since their isn't a large amount of graphically intennsive art going into unit design, we will get more content more often because an indie company can only afford to hire so many prorammers and art designers. They managed to create a game that's stylish and fun with a high degree of replayability. Bravo!			"

												Everyone is talking about how balanced the game is and how various tactics can be applied and so on.For me its the artwork of the game that caught my eye - colourful, vibrant and creative. Then there is the lore of the Duelyst World, deep and filled with great segments that describes how the various factions and monsters(that you use in the game as cards) came to be.Till now Morgan Freeman was the best narrator in my opinion and most people would agree on that but after listening to the lore, I must say Mr. Freeman has got some competition. Absolute eargasm!!Havent played much but still would recommend this to any turn based tactical lovers.			"

												I find chess complicated - and I kid you not. I never was a fan and I don't think I will ever get a hang of playing it. Ever.And yet here I am giving a thumbs-up to a game that's basically an evolution of that game. Or maybe it's chess on steroids. I don't know why I am hooked on it.Maybe it's because you play out of a hand - which is more liberating and more variable than chess. It takes inspiration from a lot of games both old and even new, and makes it better. I am not limited to diagonal, straight-line, or L-shape movements - I have six factions to build my army from, offering a load of uniquely designed minions and spells in colorful 8-bit artworks. A pawn can victoriously become your knight or queen with the right combination of cards. (and a little bit of luck on the draw)Or maybe it's the fact that matches are short and sweet (and brutally satisfying) yet always different in every way due to the multitude of options the game throws at you. Or perhaps it's the fact that it made me think of chess out of the blue - maybe getting a grip of ""two steps ahead"" will help me ladder. How it makes me wish that I knew the age old game better.It's colorful. It's complex. It's addicting. It's Duelyst.Post Season Review - here are additional thing you should know before getting into it. I still like the game but it is turning out to be a love-hate relationship.1) The kickstarter rewards - well the most basic at least - doesn't give you a big advantage. It would have if I started playing as soon as it was F2P but I didn't. So any duplicate cards that I have really didn't prove any much help. People starting just now will have to work hard into building their decks.2) You will eventually fight the same deck designs during the duration of the season. Either you will be tempted to fight a mirror match to see who uses the current flavor or just have a not so good win ratio with your original or not-so-hot deck at the moment. 3) The temptation of spending real money is high. If you're new and did not back up the kickstarter project, there will be a lot of catching up. At the very least you will have to get the 10 Pack Starter. I don't know how much of an advantage the new Division Packs will bring, knowing that the players who have been at it for a very long time would have access to both the Bronze and Silver packs at the very least. The willingness to put out cash is equal to game veterans and starters. (and all will still bow to RNG-esus)P.S. For a Trading Card Game, there's no trading involved. I hope there was some way that people can actually exchange cards to build that sense of community with the likes of Magic The Gathering.			"

												I didn't get caught up in Hearthstone. I've played M:tG competitively for something like 20 years now, and the F2P digital CCG was a phenomenon I just wasn't interested in. Duelyst, though, does have my attention. By combining the strategic element (deckbuilding) and the tactical element (sequencing) of a CCG with the movement and positioning of a tabletop wargame, Duelyst manages to be more than the sum of its parts. This strange alchemical concoction of disparate game types scratches an itch I didn't know I had. The presentation, too, is nothing to sneeze at: the pixel art style is executed as well here as I've ever seen it.I want to find something negative to say here that will temper my enthusiasm, but I can't. This game is great.			"

												By far and large my favorite online CCG. It's pretty much everything I want in a card game: Tactics, beautiful animation with it's 2D artstyle, and very rewarding free to play options. Yes you can dole out real money on this to get: extra card packs, skins for your generals, cosmetics, etc, but you can always acquire those with gold and spirit with some time invested. Thank you Counterplay games for bringing this beauty out.The rundown: You play this game with another player on a 5x9 grid. You summon creatures, cast spells, etc. The fact that the grid is there allows for more tactical gameplay as you have to plan your moves ahead dependent on your opponent. There's 6 factions in game, each with 2 generals for a total of 12 unique generals and gameplay elements to those factions. I recommend more players to try this out, the community is pretty good.

												I played this in beta but quit shortly before launch. I decided to try it again and it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It's very hard to put a finger on what doesn't feel right about Duelyst. The /idea/ of the game is great, the tile-based combat and all that is wonderful. Problem is the cards... Balance doesn't seem to be a thing and games are usually about highly uninteractive, massive swing plays. To ""counter"" this, there is hard removal, lots and lots of removals. There is just way too much hard removal in Duelyst -- which leads to many games being a race to see who fails to draw into their hard removal first... In the end, whatever it is, the game just isn't enjoyable. Perhaps if I spend a whole bunch of money it'd feel less unfair? Dunno if the P2W complainers are right, but they might be... In summary, not a fun game. It ought to be, but it's not. Try it yourself. But if you don't like it... if it feels like you can't get ANYWHERE on ladder no matter how many guides you read or videos you watch or netdecks you learn from or the number of times you build and rebuild your decks... It's not just you. Something's rotten in the state of Duelyst. Go try The Elder Scrolls Legends. Finish the campaign then invest some time in it. Then compare the experience to that of Duelyst. You'll see what I am talking about -- then you'll go back to Legends...			"

												If Fire Emblem and Hearthstone had a child game, this would be it. That's all I really need to say, as that alone made me like it.For any friends that try it: BEFORE YOU DO A LADDER MATCH USE THE CODE ""lugarugan"" for +100g and added to my list of referrals. This will afford you a spirit orb or part of a gauntlet run based on what you spend it on ingame. Oh, and gold is more common than in hearthstone. That's a plus.I repeat, do it BEFORE a ladder match. The moment you've gotten into your first ladder match, it is too late to use referral codes. Settings > Code redemption or whatever > input just 'lugarugan' as that is my Duelyst nickname. Even if you input my name on sign-up or whatever, you will likely need to do this to be considered one in the system it uses.Note: I also gain 1 spirit orb and 200 gold if you reach silver and gold divisions respectively. I can tip you after friendly matches if I have spare gold I believe though, as on average I'll be affording 1 gauntlet run a day. So in a way, I can give you some of that 200g in return if you get that far based on how many matches we play and such.However I will not start tipping gold until I am gaining more rewards per run on average than I'd get from just buying orbs. Since only one win gives me an orb and Spirit, I'm already dropping buying orbs on their own entirely, as this will also let me learn about new cards as I earn the orbs. And maybe I'll even get enough Spirit to craft some of the cards I learn about on the way! I do recommend you try the mode after reaching Silver and trying a few decks with your current cards beforehand. As learning some of the cards you get before you start trying it will go a long way in learning if they are good to pick during runs. Gauntlet deckss are made of 30 cards plus one general, picked from sets of 3 cards. You also pick your faction from a set of 3 of the 6 factions, so you won't always get your favorite faction.(I hope to get a Songhai run soon so I can do a Ranged deck in there!)			"

												[TL;DR] Duelyst is a great game. It has a charming community, a challenging and fast paced gameplay, nice soundtracks and gorgeous visuals. It is the perfect blend of Turn Based Strategy and CCGs like Hearthstone, fair and rewarding but still cheaper than the likes of MTG or HS.What is Duelyst ? Duelyst is a CCG at heart. You will collect cards, craft cards and assemble them in decks. Every card has unique properties that can change the course of a game. If at first it sounds very Hearthstone-ish, and not without reasons, in practice, the game is very different because of the board element.How's the Gameplay ? In Duelyst, you will play on a board similar to a chess board. The gameplay actually is very reminescent of chess. You have a General ( a King ) and minions ( Pawns, Rooks etc ). In addition to this, you've also got spells. All of those elements come in various sorts, buffs, debuffs, miscellaneous effects and such and their use is balanced with a cost in mana. The goal of the game is simple and straightforward : kill the enemy General. Is the game P2W ? Absolutely not. Everything, including cosmetics, can be obtained through playing and each and every expansion is free. There are some lootcrates though you can not open without paying, but I can assure you that this game is the cheapest CCG you've ever seen. Drop rates are quite generous when opening orbs and not as hard to obtain as in HS. I like to call this game the Path of Exile of CCGs. Of course, you can still buy card packs by purchasing them if you want to.What about the graphics ? If pixel art is your thing, welcome to heaven. The art in this game is beautiful. Easily the best looking pixel art around.Okay, what about the story ? The lore in this game is incredibly deeper than you'd think. More is coming soon. If you like to speculate and go treasure hunting for every tiny piece of lore you can find, this game fits the bill. You actually can see me and others speculate about it on the forums. Speaking of which.Is the community good ? Easily one of the best communities you will ever be given to see. Rarely have I seen such a friendly and open community, especially in a competitive game. EVERYONE is here to help you.Here are some links.Forums : https://forums.duelyst.com/Discord : https://discordapp.com/invite/0WbpmyLbu52aphybAdd me in-game if you want to practice some friendly matches. I guess I can also try to give you advices. Here's my IGN : deWize .			"

												The game is still fairly new, but overall it's probably my favorite CCG. The art style is unique and the mechanics of the game aren't too complex to grasp. The customization of each faction creates a good amount of depth. I would like to see more factions since there are only currently 6, but overall it's still my favorite CCG. The rate at which you obtain new cards also has a good pace to it. Best online CCG out right now. 10/10			"

I am not stretching the truth here when i say it! The graphics suit the play style so well, the strategy involved with card placements, and the familiar Mana system from Hearthstone. I'd say this is the next evolution of Strategic Card Games! Try it out, guys! Add me to your friends List on their and let's have ourselves a friendly match of Duelysts!			"

												One of those collectible card game strategy things that was released recently, which is trying most probably to the Hearthstone's child. And you can see the similarities everywhere, from the start menu and the buttons displayed, including the layout and the models of minion abilities and hero powers. However, this one is a what i can call an hybrid that combines the Hearthstone mechanics and add some new twists to it, like a real positioning or a different attack style for every minion. The thing is, I don't know why they really wanted to apply that bright retro aesthetic. Visually seems nice, but it fails to leave any impression, and for some, pixel art it's as bad as oldish things. Overall, it's nice, short, and good to waste your time with from time to time.

												This game is not p2w, i mean it is but you can farm the same stuff pretty fast in game (compared to other games), so you can have same result as pay, with a lot of grind...From other side, if you spend money on this the value you get is VERY VERY LOW, orbs and cosmetics are really expensive.Whats is really BAD when you start is the MM, basically there is no MM, you find match in 3-6 seconds, and you are literally feed to the wolfes.Also, you feed to the wolves each time the montly ranked  season begin, because mm dont take in account last season position so you can be matched with the winner of last season while you was in silver 18, lol.There is no ""non ranked"" mode.As soon you get a decent deck and some experience to pass over silver 15/12, will be much better, much more balanced match.What really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off is they still change stats of basic decks card, not just the one from last espansion, change it without tell any info to community about why they do this changes, there is no communication on steam forum, so they just destroyed one of my basic card for my general and conseguently all my play stile.My gerneral was one ""expensive"" to build a good deck because needed much more expensive card compared to other, so i invested all my grind and the money i spent onthis game on his deck.So, be aware, even the basic card cand be drastically change without apparent motive, not just the new explansion ones.The game have his issue and the dev are not perfect, so better ot play it? No, i think you can try it out, this game have ""something"" who make you play it again and again even if somethimes really♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.So, try you too! :D			"

												Just ignore most of the negative reviews. They either hate it because the keep losing to a faction due to their own ignorance on how to play or they haven't played enough to really know anything about the game. I am writing this review after having played for 37 hours without paying any money on this game and I'm still addicted and win more than half of my games as a f2p player.(I do plan on buying the preorder to the expansion because I think the game designers deserve to make some money)Before I begin this next statement I should say that I don't mean to bash Blizzard, I think they make amazing games but IMO Hearthstone is increadibly unbalanced for beginners. I came to this game from Hearthstone and haven't gone back since. This game is so much more fair to beginners. I started Hearthstone about a year ago and I can't win but once ever 5 games or so because about half way through a game someone pulls out a legendary and♥♥♥♥♥♥stomps my basic little $20 deck. The great thing about Duelyst is that no matter what faction you play, they all have removal cards so even if someone has a legendary or two you can still remove it from the field and have a fighting chance. Not to mention most legendaries aren't much more powerful than regular cards.Keep up the good work Counterplay Games! Can't wait for the mobile release!!			"

												I backed this on Kickstarter and have been playing since alpha.  It's changed quite a bit but the core mechanics have always been fantastic.  Making a good deck is only half of the challenge as you need to learn about positioning for your minions.  It's a nice extra and welcome layer of depth in a CCG.  The company is much more hands-on in terms of balancing and they're not afraid to make changes to cards and factions.  They've done a very good job in that aspect, far more than other companies.Every faction is unique and there's multiple heroes for each with their own ability and expands into their own style of play.  The first expansion comes out at the end of August and it looks promising.  There's many things they have laid out in terms of what they plan to release in the near and distant future.  I'm excited to see how it turns out but playing this for over a year now I know it's in pretty good hands.  If you're in the market for a good card game that offers more than just casual play this is something you should definitely consider.  They do a good job of introducing the game and how it plays through their tutorial.  They have challenges that can earn you free stuff as well that are like puzzles.  They've even developed a story and lore you can listen to learn about the factions and world they all come from.  Give it a try.			"

												I decided to play this game on Cool Ghosts recommendation. I was not disappointed. I used to play Hearthstone and while I like the interface, the game itself was tedious and frustrating. I've tried a few other online ccgs since then, but none of them really measured up. Duelyst is the first online ccg I've played that feels like a unique new experience and not just a dumbed down version of Magic. Lots of interesting decisions, cool art and a variety of play styles. If you like ccgs at all, you have to check this one out.			"

												I have never played a game like this before and it definitely is not a game I would normally choose, but I saw concept art for the game on artstation and had to try it out. It is very fun and very immersive. I enjoy playing against other players in a unique battle of wits. I love this game and its design. The fact the sprites are 16-32 bits etc is awesome as hell to me. I love it.			"

The curve may be a little high for new players, but the game have a great community willing to help and honestly the best developers. They are always really close to hear our opinions and are not afraid to make big and impactful changes. Don't let the game's graphics impact you in a bad way, take a look again and start exploring the amazing lore, artwork and animations this game has to offer.			"

												I honestly cannot stop playing this amazing game.What is it:  Imagine hearthstone mixed with chess!  It adds a whole new dimension of mechanics and they pull it off exceptionally well.  Be prepared to have a few sleepless nights playing this game. It's addictive, it's deep, and it's easy to learn, hard to master.I just joined a novice tournament, and I'm going to be coached by an s-rank player. I'm excited.I left Hearthstone because it got WAY too RNG, and the packs got way too stingy.Meta kept changing so rapidly and I couldn't possibly keep up with it with how stingy the legendary releases were.I opened an orb today and got two legendaries. ♥♥♥♥in yes.  1 in 4 orbs has a legendary, every 2 wins you get 15 gold, every day you get about 75 gold in challenges.  Most people get about 2 orbs a day, so that's about 15 legendaries a month just playing completely free.			"

												I've been playing this game a couple of months but it came out on Steam today. Highly recommended to anyone. I absolutely love it. I never really fancied other card games because of the lack of a physical presence but this game involves turn based strategy on a grid - kinda like that chess game Chewbacca plays in Star Wars. It's absolutely fantastic and highly addictive.The only issue I have is that I don't like their transaction system. Although you can get spirit orbs by playing you can also purchase them and they're completely random. So paying X amount of money for a product that's quality is generated at random is a bit of a joke to me, I don't dig it. People say it's the same as Hearthstone but fairer. Well, I don't really care, I didn't play Hearthstone, it's still a bad system.That said, it IS, possible to build competitive budget decks with Vanar (Kara) and Magmar (Vaath) then save up you spirit/gold for other decks - so you can go down that route if you don't want to pay.In spite of that one gripe I still highly recommend it. Give it a try and see for yourself.			"

												♥♥♥♥ing loved it , its like heartstone but with a chessboard! First 4 hrs and i have already gotten myself 4 legendaries. unique gameplay with interestingly animated 2D sprites.It is easy to play , very noob friendly too :).It is sad to say like , Heartstone , a popular tcg made by ""blizzard"" ,this game can be paid to win as you can use real money to buy packs which are used to unlock newer cards.Ladder division is rather simple , classed into 3 groups , bronze , silver and gold. Crafting is rather simple , enchanting cards and crafting better ones , those who has played online TCG would definitely know how the crafting system works.Right now , it is a little buggy , crashes when i try to make a new deck or edit my old ones. Apart from that , gameplay is smooth and fluent.Quest system is defintiely nice , has a unique ""Daily Challenge"" which challenges your mind with better tatics to destroy your opponents with.Overall , really like the game , and it might garner my support in the near future too. Further improvements can made , for example a more intricate ranking system etc.Update , 7hrs of playtime , game have been crashing every. single. match. Would not reccomend this to anyone who has a low tolerance of crashes until they fix this. "

Variety in cards-many interesting cards and combos you can do.5. F2P- It's F2P ,give it 5 min of your time to check it in.			"

												Man this game is so *good.* LooksI wasn't sure about the sci-fi fantasy thing they've got going on but quickly began to fall in love with it. The animations are excellent and bouncy and the character and unit design are incredibly unique and diverse. The soundtrack does a great job of tying it all together and the sound effects are just icing on the cake. Very visually pleasing game.GameplayTHIS GAME IS NOT PAY-TO-WIN. Like all smart people looking at the F2P section of Steam that's probably what you were looking for above everything else. Anyways, to continue:Turn-based summoning tactics. It feels almost like the table-top game Warmachine but if you took a faction deck and randomly drew spells/units and used whatever you got (But like, really well balanced because of Duelyst's mana system). You get a whole plethora of cards which you can use to populate your own custom decks and tailor them as much as you please.And talk about tactical depth: The abilities and stats of the units are somehow more diverse than their looks. There are some wild and winning combos (Though no clear meta builds which is good, anything seems to work it's just how smart you are going about combining unit abilities and spells), nothing seems bad. What I really like about playing online or against AI is that when you lose it doesn't feel like you got cheesed with a bad hand or the enemy used some OP combo: Really and truly it just feels like you were outplayed, (Which you were). The tutorial is incredibly helpful and they have a whole plethora of interesting custom challenges that not only earn you currency for spheres (Which poop out 5 random cards to add to your collection) but also challenge you to play out some more unique strategies which will improve your playing in normal games. I honestly appreciate it a lot, it's helped me grasp the logic this game plays best with.A Word on the In-Game TransactionsAs it is a free to play game, I figured I should address this as well. Like I said earlier, Duelyst certainly isn't a Pay-2-Win kind of game. Honestly the transactions are almost entirely for asthetic: It's stuff like emoticons for your generals, alternate skins, card-backs, and player icons. You can also use money to purchase spheres which, as I said before, give you random assortments of cards. I myself have not bought any nor felt the temptation too: The challenges and daily challenges reward you with coins upon completion and the spheres aren't terribly expensive. Will I buy some in the future after I've completed the 50 challenges that come with the game? I'll probably end up doing that but in-game purchases definitely are not a difference between winning and losing in this game, which is really fantastic.So yeah, Duelyst comes highly recommended and if you're a fan of any kind of turn-based game you owe it to yourself to try it out. The fact that it's free and a tiny install also helps. Great, great game.			"

Later when you sart getting legendaries it gives you a edge but every game is anyones game its all luck and strategy.If you want to ahhnialte hordes of imps and boost your shade like crazy while damaging the enemy and healing you or want to have a army of shrines that summon wind elementals at the begging of your turn, then you have the right game cause there is this and much much more.

												As one of the people lucky enough to stumble across this game in Beta i've had a good chance to jump on and see how it progressed... I played hearthstone for a good amount of time before starting duelyst and wondered how different it would be. It took me by surprise the level of strategy the board required of a player to progress anywhere in ranked despite the fact that I was only playing for fun, which brings me to one of the few problems i personally have with this game: the lack of a casual mode. I jumped back into the game after seeing an email mentioning that it had moved to steam and played a few rounds... there were some unbalanced card effects but the update on the 30th fixed some of them such as slithar elder being a 7 drop 8/8 that could potentially return to the field at the end of it's owners next turn and potentially (depending on the opponents plays) replicate every 2 turns and swarm the field, it was weakened to a much more reasonable 6/6. another notable change was shadow creeps deal a set 1 damage instead of doing more the more shadow creeps the controller has, is abyssian still an easier win that most other factions? yes. Will it be rebalanced more in the future? hopefully. If you fear not knowing the mechanics, there are solo challenges which are there to act as tutorials for beginners and daily challenges that can hold a challenge for experienced players. It has a draft format called gauntlet which is easily comparable to the arena in hearthstone for those who like more luck of the draw. The devs of this game don't unbalance the game with new updates that effect cards which means the only updates that might ruin the balance of the game is the release of a new set which will be balanced out quickly if they maintain their good work. Overall a great game and in time it will only get better.			"

												Speaking as someone with a casual interest in real-life card games at best, and as someone who hasn't really gotten into digital card games at all, I'm actually really digging this game.Several of the game's basic mechanics work to reduce the effect that random chance has on your game, such as the ability to redraw two cards at the start and another on every turn, or influencing RNG through the placement of your units.  Matchmaking feels well-balanced as well, and even building decks is easy enough to get into.  The majority of the matches I've lost, I felt it was not because my cards were outmatched or because RNG was against me, but because I was making poor decisions.The game also includes a lengthy series of single-player challenges that build a puzzle around specific game mechanics for you to solve; if you enjoy solving puzzles, you'll find a few hours of entertainment in that alone, and learn how the different mechanics work in the process, which will guide you in how you'll build your decks.

												I've been playing this game a couple of months but it came out on Steam today. Highly recommended to anyone. I absolutely love it. I never really fancied other card games because of the lack of a physical presence but this game involves turn based strategy on a grid - kinda like that chess game Chewbacca plays in Star Wars. It's absolutely fantastic and highly addictive.The only issue I have is that I don't like their transaction system. Although you can get spirit orbs by playing you can also purchase them and they're completely random. So paying X amount of money for a product that's quality is generated at random is a bit of a joke to me, I don't dig it. People say it's the same as Hearthstone but fairer. Well, I don't really care, I didn't play Hearthstone, it's still a bad system.That said, it IS, possible to build competitive budget decks with Vanar (Kara) and Magmar (Vaath) then save up you spirit/gold for other decks - so you can go down that route if you don't want to pay.In spite of that one gripe I still highly recommend it. Give it a try and see for yourself.			"

												♥♥♥♥ing loved it , its like heartstone but with a chessboard! First 4 hrs and i have already gotten myself 4 legendaries. unique gameplay with interestingly animated 2D sprites.It is easy to play , very noob friendly too :).It is sad to say like , Heartstone , a popular tcg made by ""blizzard"" ,this game can be paid to win as you can use real money to buy packs which are used to unlock newer cards.Ladder division is rather simple , classed into 3 groups , bronze , silver and gold. Crafting is rather simple , enchanting cards and crafting better ones , those who has played online TCG would definitely know how the crafting system works.Right now , it is a little buggy , crashes when i try to make a new deck or edit my old ones. Apart from that , gameplay is smooth and fluent.Quest system is defintiely nice , has a unique ""Daily Challenge"" which challenges your mind with better tatics to destroy your opponents with.Overall , really like the game , and it might garner my support in the near future too. Further improvements can made , for example a more intricate ranking system etc.Update , 7hrs of playtime , game have been crashing every. single. match. Would not reccomend this to anyone who has a low tolerance of crashes until they fix this. "

The game is pretty addictive and the support solved my issue in one day and gave me 200 extra gold for the hassle I had! Thank you Counterplay games!

												A tactical card game that many people compare to Hearthstone... The board alone makes it better than HS, at least in my opinion. The legendary drop rates are much better than other CCGs, the gold here to buy packs is super easy to get (you can get 2 packs a day if you win 14 games. 1 pack if you just do the dailies that consist of ""play"" [not win] as some factions and dealing certain ammounts of damage).All the factions are relatively balanced. Of course some are stronger than others but every faction is capable of reaching S-Rank, the highest.Even the most budget decks can reach S-Rank too since this game values positioning so much. It's not P2W at all, and anyone who says otherwise is clearly tilted because they suck or has no knowledge whatsoever about the game.			"

												Great game, played for a few months, stopped and started back again. This is pretty much Hearthstone combined with Final Fantasy Tactics/Fire Emblem. There is at least two patches (new cards, bug fix, balance patch) a month and you can get a new legendary card every month if you hit at least rank 10! Once you hit rank 20, 10, 5 you won't lose your minimum rank. You can use my referral code ""trineo"" to get 100 free gold! I dare say this is better than Hearthstone!			"

												In the wake of a lackluster season of new releases, I'm grateful Duelyst was around to keep me company. Duelyst has a little something for everyone. Whether you want to delve deep into (Yes, this game has lore, and its epic), or just need something to pass the time Duelyst has something for you. A very fast place strategy game, with a small amount of rng involved (unlike a certain other card game). Factions with various differences, but open to a mix of different play styles. A solid, friendly dev team that more than worth putting a bit of trust in. All this has pushed Duelyst into one of my favorite games of all time.Duelyst: 8.3/10Hearthstone: 6.8/10			"

												This game is fun and free, I recommend it to any tatics game and card game lovers or lovers of pixel art (the sprites look really cool). It does have a tad of learning curving cause the game is very different but the game has good tutorials and the puzzle challenges will get you up to snuff in no time. If your familar with the basics of cards game or tatics games you shouldn't have any problems. Card packs are pretty generous and on average you get a legendary in 1 in 5 packs, so the grind isn't terrible. All in all the game is a lot of fun and you lose nothing trying it, so give it a shot!

												Pretty much the only online cardgame I enjoyed playing for more than 15min, which is saying something. The cards have ample strategic assets to them which make every game an unique one within just a few turns, and I'm not talking about rare cards you'll have to buy. Even with the starter packs there are already a huge amount of easily comprehendable spells and skills that make every game about strategy rather than raw stats or who has the shiniest cards. Most impressing about this is that none of the factions appear rediculously OP while they each have their own cards and gimmick.And there are a bunch of strategy challenges to defeat an AI opponent within one turn that will really help to understand all the skills and their potentials, which are also really enjoyable if you like puzzle games.But what I appreciate most about this game is that you can do what you want even if your previous move is still being executed. If you move a minion to a different tile, you can click on that tile and tell the minion to attack, drag a new card onto the field and end your turn while that minion walks to the tile. And everything will be executed as you ordered in correct order, rather than you having to wait until the moving sequence ends before you can do anything else.All in all a very enjoyable game.			"

												A TCG in which you collect cards and use them to battle your opponent. The battles work in a fashion similar to Final Fantasy Tactics games - you have to place your units strategically to claim victory. There are several factions that all have several leaders - if he dies, the game is over, so killing him is your goal. The factions are all different and focus on different strengths and weaknesses - there is no faction canceling another out completely, though, so you always have some tactical room.Overall the game is very nice, looks good (very appealing pixel art on 2D-backgrounds - takes some time getting used to but is certainly an interesting style), is balanced, !NOT P2W! and is all around fun.Recommended!

												Speaking as someone with a casual interest in real-life card games at best, and as someone who hasn't really gotten into digital card games at all, I'm actually really digging this game.Several of the game's basic mechanics work to reduce the effect that random chance has on your game, such as the ability to redraw two cards at the start and another on every turn, or influencing RNG through the placement of your units.  Matchmaking feels well-balanced as well, and even building decks is easy enough to get into.  The majority of the matches I've lost, I felt it was not because my cards were outmatched or because RNG was against me, but because I was making poor decisions.The game also includes a lengthy series of single-player challenges that build a puzzle around specific game mechanics for you to solve; if you enjoy solving puzzles, you'll find a few hours of entertainment in that alone, and learn how the different mechanics work in the process, which will guide you in how you'll build your decks.

												A deck-based game, similar to Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering, with the caveat that there is a board-- space is an important dimension here, and it really adds a lot to the strategy element.  While many matches can have good luck or bad luck of the draw, it feels like most often, the better player will tend to come out on top (though not always!).Duelyst features a pretty cool aesthetic, kickass music, sound strategy, and a business model that (so far) doesn't feel like pay-walling.  The starter decks are actually pretty effective, and the most uncommon cards generally have the most complicated and obscure effects, without being straight upgrades.The combos you can chain up quickly reach the point of ridicule, where virtually every deck can have that ""Oh wow, that's such incredible BS"" reaction.  But the fun thing is the BS often can go both ways.Games are short (usually <5 minutes a match).  Comebacks are frequent.  Streaks, win or lose, usually no more than 4 or 5 games.  Pretty addictive game, in general.  I would consider this a solid, reasonably balanced, turn-based strategy, but sometimes heavily luck-influenced.			"

												It's turn based tactics meets Hearthstone. But unlike HS, Duelyst actually offers a little more depth and way less RNG. It's way less grind as well. Legendaries are way easier to get, and cheaper to craft. The only downside is that it seems to be a little unbalanced. Ranged minions can attack from anywhere in the battlefield, so the usual strategy to them seems to be: put them in a remote corner and buff them as you watch your opponent wastes prime removal to destroy your 3 mana creature. Same thing with blast minions, that does damage to every single minion in a line from affar. Why can't ranged minions work the same way they do in fire emblem or advance wars? And wouldn't it be better if blast minion did damage to their own cretures as well? Wouldn't it be a little more balanced this way?But overral, it's a good game. Way better than Hearthstone, I say.

												Great combination of CCG and tactical game play. The whole game is generally very well produced, the cards are generally well balanced, and there are plenty of opportunities to obtain gold to get new cards. One can complete quests without actually winning games, so that makes it easier to complete your card collection.   Gameplay is tense and interesting, and positioning and other board decisions are just as important as deck building and choice of card play. The opportunity to swap a card out of your hand for a fresh one each turn is great, and helps you feel less at the whim of random luck.   There have been some growing pains, as the steam release (and now a week later, the release of the first major expansion (including 105 new cards)) has been pretty hard on the servers. But representatives of Counterplay have been active on the forums here on steam, on the Discord chat, and on Reddit, and have been very helpful. Customer support was great and prompt when I had an issue. I'm looking forward to playing this one a lot.			"

Since the day I downloaded this game, there is not a day that goes by that I don't play this game.Duelyst is a game developed and published by Counterplay Games[duelyst.com]. A competitive game focused on tactical combat, squad building, and ranked ladder play.Duelyst is a perfect mix between CCG and chess. The matches are played out on a five-by-nine board that starts with just you and your opponent’s general. Each general has a unique Spell. Like most other CCGs, you draw cards from a custom built deck, play spells, and summon minions until you’ve killed the opposing general. The card pool is split into six factions, each with their own unique style, along with a large group of neutral cards. Right now, I'm starting to like the playstyle of Vanar and Songhai. All six factions feel unique and expressive, in both their playstyles and their art.And speaking of art. This is a major high point of Duelyst. Pixel art has become a popular option among indie developers, and is associated by some skeptics with a lack of resources to make something ‘better.’ But Duelyst’s sprites feature some of the greatest pixel art animation I’ve ever seen. Only the units and card effects are pixelated, but the extreme level of detail that goes into each one is stunning. And thanks to Duelyst’s dynamic lighting system, the sprites don’t feel out of place in its non-pixelated battlefields and UI.  Alough the game offers you in-game purchases where you could buy Spirit Orbs—Duelyst's version of pack of cards. It turns out to be really rewarding since you get gold for winning games and completing daily quests.The Verdict: 9 out of 10. My new favorite card game! ♥ But I'm still waiting for Gwent[www.playgwent.com] to come out.			"

												3/4 common, 1/2 uncommon, and you're lucky if you get an epic or legendary. I went from about 1/5 packs for a legendary to 1/10 with this new expansion. It's fun, since packs are now worth half of what they are, it's no longer worth your money. You can still get a ton of gold, so that's nice I guess.			"

After just a couple hours of playtime and using a referral code for an exrta 100 gold ( one pack ) I have made it to silver rank, that seems about where you can sit till you either pay for more cards right away or grind for the better cards you will need to get more competitive to go in lower rank. The game is pretty addictive and the support solved my issue in one day and gave me 200 extra gold for the hassle I had! Thank you Counterplay games! Use my referral code -  Assault  -for the free 100 gold and to ask me any questions about the game when signing up! Do all the solo challenges when starting to get a bunch of gold right off to get a couple set of packs.			"

												A deck-based game, similar to Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering, with the caveat that there is a board-- space is an important dimension here, and it really adds a lot to the strategy element.  While many matches can have good luck or bad luck of the draw, it feels like most often, the better player will tend to come out on top (though not always!).Duelyst features a pretty cool aesthetic, kickass music, sound strategy, and a business model that (so far) doesn't feel like pay-walling.  The starter decks are actually pretty effective, and the most uncommon cards generally have the most complicated and obscure effects, without being straight upgrades.The combos you can chain up quickly reach the point of ridicule, where virtually every deck can have that ""Oh wow, that's such incredible BS"" reaction.  But the fun thing is the BS often can go both ways.Games are short (usually <5 minutes a match).  Comebacks are frequent.  Streaks, win or lose, usually no more than 4 or 5 games.  Pretty addictive game, in general.  I would consider this a solid, reasonably balanced, turn-based strategy, but sometimes heavily luck-influenced.			"

												It's turn based tactics meets Hearthstone. But unlike HS, Duelyst actually offers a little more depth and way less RNG. It's way less grind as well. Legendaries are way easier to get, and cheaper to craft. The only downside is that it seems to be a little unbalanced. Ranged minions can attack from anywhere in the battlefield, so the usual strategy to them seems to be: put them in a remote corner and buff them as you watch your opponent wastes prime removal to destroy your 3 mana creature. Same thing with blast minions, that does damage to every single minion in a line from affar. Why can't ranged minions work the same way they do in fire emblem or advance wars? And wouldn't it be better if blast minion did damage to their own cretures as well? Wouldn't it be a little more balanced this way?But overral, it's a good game. Way better than Hearthstone, I say.

												Great combination of CCG and tactical game play. The whole game is generally very well produced, the cards are generally well balanced, and there are plenty of opportunities to obtain gold to get new cards. One can complete quests without actually winning games, so that makes it easier to complete your card collection.   Gameplay is tense and interesting, and positioning and other board decisions are just as important as deck building and choice of card play. The opportunity to swap a card out of your hand for a fresh one each turn is great, and helps you feel less at the whim of random luck.   There have been some growing pains, as the steam release (and now a week later, the release of the first major expansion (including 105 new cards)) has been pretty hard on the servers. But representatives of Counterplay have been active on the forums here on steam, on the Discord chat, and on Reddit, and have been very helpful. Customer support was great and prompt when I had an issue. I'm looking forward to playing this one a lot.			"

												I have been playing this game since early alpha back in march of last year. This is by far one of the best CCGs I have ever played and the art is gorgeous.Having you cards move around on a battlefield feels really awesome instead of static images running in to eachother. All of the factions have unique mechanics and units that set them apart from the others while also having access to tons of neutral units with awesome effects as well.This game does have microtransactions but most are cosmetic, which you can still craft by breaking down other cards. As far as P2W goes this game is very generous with the amount of gold given per day so that you can always net atleast 1-2 packs a day. One of the biggest things for me is the community we have in this game. It has been and still is one of the best gaming communities I have seen and even the developers hang out in the Discord server to chat with us.Do yourself a favor and give Duelyst a try especially if you are a fan of games like Hearthstone, Fire Emblem, Magic: The Gathering, or Final Fantasy Tactics then I am sure you will love this game!PS: Use referral code ""Lassic"" in game to net us some free packs!

												At first I wasn't expecting anything from a f2p-game but I tried it and I gotta say that this is definitely not a pay2win game, as you can only buy cosmetics. Well you can buy card packs, but you get so much gold that you probably don't even need to cash.I had a lot of fun with this game, it's very tactical in terms of positioning and I like the feature that you can replace cards every turn which makes it ""less"" random to win.It is also pretty good balanced and nobody is overpowered, unless you let Abyssian sacrifice all her wraithlings to buff her minion until it kills everybody in 1 hit.But overall this game is now my favorite TCG on PC.10/10 - Better than Hearthstone			"

												I started CCGs with hearthstone, then moved to magic when hearthstone's design went in a direction I didn't like. I picked up Duelyst about a week ago again after trying it in the early beta days, and after giving it a fair shake this time, it blows hearthstone and MTG out of the water. Love the extra dimension of decisionmaking the 9x5 grid brings, love the consistency that being able to replace a card in your hand every turn brings (essentially discard then draw), and overall it feels like you're less of a victim to variance than in most games of its nature.The game uses digital design space well, has a healthy amount of randomness without being sickeningly forced like in HS, and I'm overall excited for the future of this game.

												I was a player of Duelyst before it even came out to Steam, and from the moment I started playing I already knew that I would recommend it.Firstly, if you think the game is a Hearthstone ripoff, it is not.The game does clearly have core elements of Hearthstone, such as mana costs, health and attack statistics, as well as summoning minions and trying to reduce the opponent's character to zero health. While that may seem so similar, there is one aspect that makes the game completely different- the 9 x 5 board.Adding a tiled board space to move around in instantly makes the game much more intriguing than it already may have been. Matches play out differently, you're forced to think differently, and, there are more chances to win.However, that's all besides the point.You should get this game already because its just awesome. Heartstone is great, but Duelyst brings it up another notch. If you like Hearthstone, you'll love this just as much or more. (and even more if chess is another one of your things)Duelyst's art style and character design are absolutely jaw-dropping. Even if the graphics are pixel based... Each unit or general are so well crafted and each look unique. Each unit also has individual attack animations which usually look stunning for pixel graphics.Battles are fast and end usually under 10 minutes. The only bad things I have to say is that the art style, while great and unique, isn't very cohesive (sleek, sci-fi to pixels), and there is of course some minor balancing issues (but what game doesn't have those).Tl:dr- get this game plz			"

												Played this game for about a month or so before it was released on Steam, and I have to say that this game has an incredible amount of detail and polish to it. The Turn-Based Strategy aspect of the game and the fact that it's played on a grid adds a lot more depth, strategy, and tactical thinking than most other CCGs. And with it's first expension coming at the end of the month, it couldn't be a better time to pick this game up.			"

												Really fun, nice pay model, easy to pick up, hard to master... Fans of Hearthstone, MTG, etc. will feel right at home. Great tooltipsI see some complaints over the pay model, and it is like Hearthstone where if you purchase a ton of packs and unlock all the legendaries (Or craft them through scrapping things) you will have a larger pool of cards... but it still has some skill involved, even moreso than hearthstone (Due to positioning of units) so the RNG aspects arent as powerful.

Summoning your creatures(minions) on a board and position them to annihilate your foes! The factions are really varied and all have a great feel to them.Tho I have one complaint;The game sometimes completely freezes. I can't interact with the board or spells in any way and even the End Turn button doesn't respond anymore. I can't even concede when this happens. I play on a Macbook Pro 13 inch, are there more facing this problem? Because this is the only reason the game isn't perfect. Please Counterplay, fix this!!			"

												I've been playing this for a long time before it hit Steam. I had been on the lookout for a nice CCG for a while, as I really enjoyed Hearthstone, but found it way too grindy. For me, this is the one. The gameplay is fairly simple and easy to get into. The tactical grid is nice, it allows for positioning to come into play, and increases the skill beyond just drawing and playing the right cards. Many good players have in fact reached high ranks playing supposedly weak factions or decks just because they are skilled at the game, so while there are always some slight imbalances, all factions are represented at high levels (and at lower levels too).Card acquisition is a lot more generous than Hearthstone, you get gold pretty easily from doing daily quests, enough to easily buy a pack of cards every day. The base set also has a fairly high legendary drop rate, although they tuned this down a bit in the expansion.The art style is an acquired taste, the pixel art is great, but the mixture of arts styles is a bit odd. You get used to it.For me, this is the best online CCG I have tried by far, and it's free, so I would highly recommend giving it a go.			"

												Having come with a background in both TCGs and CCGs, I can honestly say that Duelyst is among the top of my list. Forget traditional games such as Yu-Gi-Oh or Magic; Duelyst takes a different approach by presenting players with a tactical board in which they are free to move, summon, and battle upon. Put in simpler terms, imagine a better Hearthstone — albeit not completely ridding itself of the microtransaction aspect. Without further adue, I'll dive into the comparisons. Pros: — Extreme replayability.— A plethora of cards to obtain and use.— Dynamic battle system and well-scripted animations.— A faction system in which each ""General"" possesses his/her own unique ability.— Ability to play against friends or against randoms.— Ranking system is relatively easy to climb without punishing you too hard for losing.— Uh guys.... this game is free!?Cons: — Can be considered a semi pay-to-win game. — If you're willing to invest money, then you have a higher chance at getting better cards as opposed to those who didn't.— Doesn't have Harambe as a character.— Simple to pick up but hard to master. Anyone is welcome to message me more if you'd like more insight! Peace~ "

												This game is not p2w, i mean it is but you can farm the same stuff pretty fast in game (compared to other games), so you can have same result as pay, with a lot of grind...From other side, if you spend money on this the value you get is VERY VERY LOW, orbs and cosmetics are really expensive.Whats is really BAD when you start is the MM, basically there is no MM, you find match in 3-6 seconds, and you are literally feed to the wolfes.Also, you feed to the wolves each time the montly ranked  season begin, because mm dont take in account last season position so you can be matched with the winner of last season while you was in silver 18, lol.There is no ""non ranked"" mode.As soon you get a decent deck and some experience to pass over silver 15/12, will be much better, much more balanced match.What really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off is they still change stats of basic decks card, not just the one from last espansion, change it without tell any info to community about why they do this changes, there is no communication on steam forum, so they just destroyed one of my basic card for my general and conseguently all my play stile.My gerneral was one ""expensive"" to build a good deck because needed much more expensive card compared to other, so i invested all my grind and the money i spent onthis game on his deck.So, be aware, even the basic card cand be drastically change without apparent motive, not just the new explansion ones.The game have his issue and the dev are not perfect, so better ot play it?

												Wizard Chess at it's finest. You won't find a F2P CCG that matches the quality you can find in Duelyst. A generous Quest system allows for many ways for F2P players to gather or craft cards and effluvia, and buying in isn't painful with entire sets for sale.I've been wanting a game just like this since I played Archon epochs ago, a fantasy strategy game played on a board. The card aspect makes building decks so much fun, because you have to take in effect how they will synergize on the board, adding a whole tactical layer I find intoxicating. It's a really tight, crunchy, fast and brutal game. The sound design, sprite animations, the entire package. . . it's just so damn good. The best in it's genre even.Magmar for life.			"

												I’ve long been a fan of turn-based tactics games. From playing chess against my dad at a young age, through to the perfection of Advance Wars and the bizarre depths of Disgaeia, i’m a sucker for ponderous battles. I’ve recently acquired a taste for card games too, thanks to the likes of Netrunner and Hearthstone, so when Deulyst – a fusion of turn-based tactics and card game – popped up on my radar, my eyes lit up.Deulyst is essentially Hero Academy mashed together with Hearthstone – a mix of ever-increasing-mana-fuelled card play and unit movement where two opposing General’s battle to the death, calling upon warriors and spells for help. Deciding which card to play also comes with the choice of where to play it, and how to move your existing warriors too. It’s the strategy of chess merged with the customisable depths of a modern card game, borrowing from its peers to make a beautifully designed and balanced game.It’s also surprisingly fast paced – a combination of quickly escalating powers, tight strategy and the combo potential of a customised deck. With a mix of painterly, vibrant sci-fi backgrounds and glowing, gorgeously animated pixel art monsters, Deulyst backs its robust gameplay with stunning visuals too.Each faction brings differing abilities and deck building options, and although you’ll probably have to spend some money on extra cards to get the most out of it, Deulyst is generous enough as it is, offering a sublime blend of pace, visuals and depth for nothing.

												I have not played long BUT in my personal opinion it is way better than hearthstone!Reasons why? Well these are based off of the few games i have played.Every situation can be changed with just a single card.You can replace one card each turn which makes it more likely to get the card you want just by replacing it with a useless one at the time being (No card is useless)Cons???? NOTHINGMORE PROThere is balance, If there is an OP combo then there is a simple way to disarm it, such as sun bloom (Dispels in a 2x2 radius) It can take away a really good spell combo in an instantTIP ~ But i have found a really OP combo. The youngflame wing and the Bastion with the Lyonar faction is really a scary combo if you have the cards named, Bastion, Youngflame wing, and a couple of divine bonds, Ofcourse there is a way to delete this whole combo, Have the youngflame wing and bastion out, do what you can to protect the youngflame wing while it gains health (If you can beat them before the combo is there than do it) and finally when the young flame wing reaches 10 health put 2 divine bonds on that baby and ta-da you have a 25 attack damage monster that can be anywhere on the board, If you happen to have 3 Divine bonds, Well then say hello to a 35 attack damage one hitting monsterBut like i said, There is balance so this combo can be undone in an instant if they know what you are up to. Nothing is possible here without it not having an easy counter. Good game I recommend it 100%			"

												Very addicting strategy card game. Overall gameplay is solid. I will say that if someone has a loaded deck of ranged minions or is loaded with spells, it can be tough and seems a little unbalanced. I also wish the 2D figures were a little more detailed, perhaps even little 3d models (just to add a little more fun to the emotes and attacks, etc.), but that really isn't a big deal as the gameplay makes up for everything. I'd recommend for anyone remotely interested in strategy games and is even slightly familiar with turn based fighting.			"

												Played this quite a while before it got to steam. It's by far the best digital CCG on the market. Where Hearthstone depends on RNG to differentiate matches that would otherwise be similar, duelyst's tactical grid leads to vastly different games based on subtle positioning changes- meaning every loss and victory owes significantly more to player skill, proper positioning, etc. The art (both large scale and the pixellated animated characters) is gorgeous, and the monetization system is fair. Just play it.			"

But i am really enjoying the game with the amount of things you ghave to do.This game adds some single player modes that are realy fun.On the down side the grind is there, you spend a lot of time farming gold, and crafting cards, you can always pay, but if you want go play it 100% free, get ready.Other negative point is that you can not (re)do de daily challenge, i am not asking for the gold out of the day challenge. My point is there are some days i can not play. I would like to be able to do the challenges i miss.			"

												A more in-depth review here along with gameplay vid: https://nohkgaming.wordpress.com/2016/08/03/now-playing-duelyst/TL;DR:Mechanics introduced by earlier card games like MtG are present with various awesome mixes of its own features. A card game with strategy built not solely on the cards alone but on where you place your minions, the timing of your spells, and the effective trading of your own HP and your minions to clear off your opponent's threats.Battle Pets still are unpredictable, and that's a healthy dose of randomness for the game.If you're tired of just playing a card game where you just /play your cards/, why not give this a try? Movement, placement, timing. All these come together to create a wonderful game!Plus, if you think card games like this are pay-to-win, you're dead wrong! I haven't spent a dime, and I've only started playing June 30, and I've gotten to Gold Division two times already with budget decks that can compete with even the fully-built archetype decks!			"

												I’ve long been a fan of turn-based tactics games. From playing chess against my dad at a young age, through to the perfection of Advance Wars and the bizarre depths of Disgaeia, i’m a sucker for ponderous battles. I’ve recently acquired a taste for card games too, thanks to the likes of Netrunner and Hearthstone, so when Deulyst – a fusion of turn-based tactics and card game – popped up on my radar, my eyes lit up.Deulyst is essentially Hero Academy mashed together with Hearthstone – a mix of ever-increasing-mana-fuelled card play and unit movement where two opposing General’s battle to the death, calling upon warriors and spells for help. Deciding which card to play also comes with the choice of where to play it, and how to move your existing warriors too. It’s the strategy of chess merged with the customisable depths of a modern card game, borrowing from its peers to make a beautifully designed and balanced game.It’s also surprisingly fast paced – a combination of quickly escalating powers, tight strategy and the combo potential of a customised deck. With a mix of painterly, vibrant sci-fi backgrounds and glowing, gorgeously animated pixel art monsters, Deulyst backs its robust gameplay with stunning visuals too.Each faction brings differing abilities and deck building options, and although you’ll probably have to spend some money on extra cards to get the most out of it, Deulyst is generous enough as it is, offering a sublime blend of pace, visuals and depth for nothing.

												I have to say this fit's the genera very well. I was engrossed with the overall look and feel of the game; however, there was a distinct lack of things to do. For myself, endlessly grinding away in PvP dueling decks against other players was well done in Magic Online or another card games ad nausium. The game has a few annoyances as well, but let’s touch on the overall look and fee.The interface was intuitive and well designed, I felt like I could easily navigate throughout the game UI with a little critical reading and some of that age old common sense exploration. The Art and Sound of this game is amazing, I would have to say that the digital and concept art for this did nothing to prepare me for the absolute breathtaking beauty of the actual game content itself. I will have this in my ""go to"" list for years to come along side Minecraft and Terraria.Now with a few of the problems with these types of games that is more player than developer in some cases. First I took issue with the progression system. In many cases people were exploiting the progression by auto queuing and idle timing out, or using lag code to prevent the client from establishing a connection during the initial connection phase. This exploit takes advantage of the ""double win"" scenario as well as help keep unskilled players higher in the ranks. Another exploit I was noticing is the play bots that we saw in Magic the Gathering Online. I do believe that in any competitive game the absence of these bots may never be possible with the way privacy and national policy provide. SO play as you wish but do not dig in and pretend you will never encounter issues, bots or bugs.As always play on, report bots and do your best to keep the community sassy!Best,Illian Amerond "

												Duelyst is a excellently crafted game, if Hearthstone had a baby with Fire Emblem, Duelyst would be born.Duelyst has the core gameplay of Hearthstone and they got the board mechanic of Fire Emblem, shoved them together with tinkering, threw in badass pixel art and said: ""This is gonna be good"", for now though, lets get into the core elements.User InterfaceRating - 7/10Similair to: Hearthstone, OverwatchThe interface has sleek elements from overwatch and that cursed gaussian blur (It lags out my Laptop D:) feature, It gives you core elements that you need to know without obscuring the main board in which you play, your hand is neatly placed and elements are where you want them. It loses points for losing certain important details and lag.CommunicationRating - 3/10Similair to: HearthstoneCommunication is bare bones, you have cute little emoticons and quotes which can be accessed from your icon, its not really practical and insulting those 1000 ping wimps is harder. Let alone valued conversations are hard to get, Imagine a post office where you can only say 15 things and add certain images or its filtered, its that bad.GameplayRating - 9/10Similair to: Fire EmblemThe gameplay is very intunuitive, with various card types dragged from hearthstone and put into the beatiful Fire Emblem style, encounters occur the same as FE, with hit-counter-end. Provoke cards tarap opponents who dare step near it and death wish cards do something when they die, archers are infinity range units, with all these card types and mana costs, its really deep and makes you revise.OnlineRating - 5/10Similair to: CSGOYou have to pass a certain point to go Online, like CSGO, thats all I know, I haven't got there.GraphicsRating - 10/10Similair to: None, its uniqueIts mixture of high quality imagery for portraits and card backs to the lovely little dudes you move across the board, each bit is polished and refined to its best ability, I can stare at the main menu for hours, its beautiful.Overall Rating 8/10Little to touch up except variety but this is lacking a bit of elements, but not so much that you should dismiss this great game, its also graphics moddable apparently.

												I've played since shortly after open beta, long before it was available on Steam, to get away from Hearthstone for a bit. It was a breathe of fresh air from the folks at Counter Play Games. Grid based card game. Say if Magic and Fire Emblem had a child, wrapped up into one cool sprited based draw fest. To keep this short, as there are many other reviews that would be better suited if you wanted an  overview, I've recently been pulled away from it to a recent change they did in the last patch with the gold progression/quest system. It is no longer casual friendly, and you will have to play more games each day to maximize your gold gain. Shame really. It was something Blizzard never did with Hearthstone, and now Counter Play went down the same road. This doesn't competely kill, what already is, a fantastic game, and a game that actually gets balance changes monthly, even bi-weekly, unlike already said card game. Play it. The sprites are amazing, the music and boards are great to look at, and the random number generator is very very minimmal.			"

												Great game with nice use of positioning along with position-based mechanics and spells. Just wish for the following: Less of: - One-click AoE board clears (frost burn, enfeeble, plasma storm etc.)- Lessen impact on do-or-die threats the moment they hit the board (all CCGs have this stupid gimmick)More of: - Positional spells/minions, particularly AoE spells that punish bad positioning.- Revolve the game around value minion trades (or face) instead of crap like Meltdown/JuggernautsOverall, I will still highly recommend this game over other CCGs.

												Let's keep it simple: Give this game a try if you like to use your brain and be rewarded for good tactics. It's also free, tested with Norton for pesky viruses ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Superficial Pros:Beautiful (and unique) art-styleLiking the Minimalistic ""tablet-friendly"" design; it sounds weird but I like the minimalismThe animations of the units are beyond satisfying to watchPros:Addictive (maybe a pro?)Very flexible but not spared from metas; I didn't feel the meta influence as heavily as in HearthStoneCan perform okay with the starter deckYou need to actually use tactics! WOW! What a feature! Each faction represents a unique playstyle (veree nais)Superficial cons: The menu UI design is case of form over functionSomewhat eggregious microtransactions (yes, I know it's a F2P title, they're still bad)Seriously, (worthless) Boss Cases drop from fun Boss Battles, locking rewards away through a paywall. Classic.Cons:Buggier than the Beta Crashes or gets stuck on certain menus/pages (most often in the crafting menu, happens everywhere else though)No Steam Overlay support - you need to login seperately to give them microtransaction money (I put this here because it's really frickity frick fricking frustrating)Abyssian Cancer Host <3This game is unique, I hate the microtransactions, feels like style is focused on while substance takes second , or even third place. Try it out and don't be a frugal ♥♥♥♥♥ like me, you won't be disappointed <3 "

												If you like CCG + strategy games this is a must! Made by a small team, Counterplay Games managed to create an amazing and involving game, with rich mechanics, cool art style and rich lore. Don't be fooled thinking this is a copy of Hearthstone, besides some UI similarities, the addition of the board make the position aspect of the game very important and create some interesting situations. The game play is way more dense and skill related. Every factions and general (yes, generals, even being from the same faction, have different abilities called Bloodbourne Spells) feels very unique, not only for their looks and lore but also their playstyle. Its common to spend hours just creating and tweaking decks based on different cards, strategies and generals. The game is also very generous with card drops, and the usual chance to get a Legendary is 1 for 4 packs. And its not uncommon to get even 2 Legs per pack. Give it a chance, you wont regret!			"

You don't have to buy anything from the store, unless you're desprate, you can just save up spirit orbs. The gameplay is just, so unique that it makes me want to cry that it's finaly not a cliche and not a 50% Hearthstone copy. This game sets a whole new level of impressiveness. I can't just describe in a paragraph, guys! It's just that good! It's like TCG meets pixel games and they had a baby. If you love TCG and the classic pixel games, then this one is a must have for you! It's beautiful, amazing, and just the best that I have ever seen!

												First of all I really hope the devs read my review because I'll be super sincere. Sorry for the long post.Second, I play this game on my secondary account not this one.---Quick review for player in the end---For me there are only three online CCG that are worth to play: Hearthstone, Faeria and Duelyst.I played Hearthstone since beta and now I'm quitting because of the P2W fator. Even playing ever day I never pass rank 10, I belive this is the limit of F2P player on Hearthstone.So I tested Faeria and Duelyst, both are great game, much less P2W then Hearthstone once the games also make money with cosmetics. Don't get me wrong, I understand the devs must earn money so I see no problem in selling card packs for money, even though I believe Faeria and Duelyst can be a little bit generous. So, for me, the optimum point could be able have like 80% of a card expansion (without spending money) 4 or 6 weeks before the relaese of the next expansion. I'll test Duelyst until the next expansion comes to see if I'm able to do so, same goes to Faeria.Now talking about only Duelyst: It's a solid game, original, even being original you'll feel that you already now everything you must know. The matches are quick and there aren't those 2 or 3 turns where the players just pass to each other waiting to reach 3 mana cuz your starting hand is too heavy. Talking about hand you can replace one card of your hand every turn! The lore idea is super nice. Okay now we are entering the bad side: Duelyst have few problems and one big situation that isn't its fault. Duelyst doesn't have a casual mode where you can test your new decks and I'd really want to know why. Most of the game is in pixel art (some people don't like it) which I personally love. Besides that there is nothing more to complain, maybe the solo mode is too short? Or they could have introduce a coop mode (I really want it) ? But these are not negative side, the game just don't have it yet (please coop mode!!). The major problem of Duelyst is not Duelyst but the CCG genre, because of the fact you must farm gold to buy the card packs you can't play two CCG, you must choose one, it's not like playing Zelda and Horizon where you can alternate to progress in both games. For example my gf don't like hearthstone anymore, but she also don't quit to start anothe CCG cuz she don't want to lose her progress. So with this in mind I can see that on PC the CCG genre is dominated by Hearthstone and Faeria is slowly rising with new good ideas.I must say that for me Duelyst is more fun than Faeria but due to the fact of the coop anouncment I'll be forced to play Faeria on PC. NOW PAY ATTENTION: Duelyst will totally dominate the CCG mobile market when it release for Android and iOS. So, that's why I'll keep playing Duelyst too, because as a mobile experience it'll humiliate Hearthstone.More than card I belive Duelyst just need three things for now, which should not prevent you to play it: a casual mode, a coop mode and add a mobile version.--- Quick player review ---1) Pros:- Original- Easier to get ingame gold than Hearthstone- Tactical (so epic/legend cards doesnt have that impact on gameplay)- You can literally move your General on battlefield.- Lore (a lot of)- Nice art and fantasy world.- Solo mode (short, but there is one)- Factions Instead of classes- You can unlock all characters just playing- Minions create life when you play (full body and stuff)- You can buy card pack more easy than Hearstone- Expansions have less cards, so more easy to ""catch'em all""- There is some cosmetics, if you want to spend some real money to look cool- If you eventually buy the $49,99 card pack they refund you with the ingame gold that you spent previously2) Neutral- Pixel art (I love it in fact, but some don't)- Generals have no voice lines (I really don't care about it)3) Cons- Without spending money for cosmetics you must get a box of cosmetics + a key, this is a little anouying.- No casual mode so far- For me, ranged minions are a little OP.4) Veredic: If you are tired of Hearthstone or you like tactical and CCG game you must play it. Duelyst is underrated, it worth a check.Score: 9.0/10.0 (I'll give 11/10 when it has a casual and coop mode, wait for it)All the best			"

												f2p with a little pay 2 win. But its even fun without spending a cent. Most negative reviews are from people who spend money and were blocked from the humble bundle promo.The additional stuff is really expensive and the cosmetic items are trashMaybe the developers should add a card trading system, but at the end this will lead to even more pay 2 win :/			"

												The game is very good and deep enough. You know what I mean.Tip for creators: Would be not bad to have some ""packages"" users can buy directly via Steam. I know it's not that easy to implement, but people are very... very conservative :). Also you can attract more visitors by running weekly deals on these packages  ;) And during sales too...I would like to support the game and buy a few orbs for real money, but it's an additional step to push some buttons in-game... Also an idea to buy MORE orbs during a sale seems pretty attractive to me. Yeah, I know, consumerism... but what can I do? :)			"

												If you want a really good card game, with great strategy and community, where you can play the best decks, go play Android: Netrunner on Jinteki.net (seriously, fantastic game and using jinteki you get access to every card in the game). If you want rankings, join an online league. (A:NR is a Live Card Game, a LCG. So no randomisation of card packs)However, if you want a really good card game that's also a grind, this is is better. Playing a reasonable amount - a few hours a day after work, a few more than that on the weekends - you get to open about 1 booster a day of play. It's fun to slowly (very slowly, to be fair) build up your collection. Dismantling a few cards to craft new ones you need to improve your decks to make it easily to win games and get the gold you need to buy more boosters and get more packs.I focus on this last point becuase I thinks it's the only thing that makes me play it over A:NR, the working towards a collection.However, I play it over other CCGs such as Magic and HS because it is a superior game. The mechanics are more fun, it's less pay to win, a budget deck can perform well against decks with legendary cards. It's a mix between card game and board game. It reminds me of the board game Summoner Wars, but you can't play that online with the same sort of development support.Overall, I think this game is good fun, I really enjoy it! But it's a huge time sink - beware before you play. I also believe the cost to buy 'orbs', the game's booster packs are too expensive for what you get. If you want to play everything, and not drop loads of money/time before you can, please go check out Netrunner on Jinteki.net first.			"

												Duelyst is a pretty interesting game. It plays very similarly to Magic The Gathering and Hearthstone in that it uses the Cost/Health/Damage formula for it's units, but adds a neat little twist. Units placed on the board can be moved around like chess pieces (and in most cases must be next to an opponent's unit to attack it). It's a nice change of pace for a card game that holds your interest very early on, but one problem I find is that it gradually loses the hold on your attention span, especially if you're a long term player of Magic or Hearthstone.

												In my opinion its an innovated Hearthstone combined with turn-based strategy gameplay. I would like the pixel graphics to be a little more crisp but the style is legit, you can play casual or get heavy into the meta. It's free to play / soft pay to win (like hearthstone you can buy boosters and stack your deck day one but they also let you buy the a whole expansion for a flat fee of $20 USD). Side notes*Boss Battles are on the way*IOS & Android play is on the way*most of the very few negative reviews should be ignored, you'll see they have ove 100+ hours into this FREE game,  they obviously had their fun and you should too :D			"

												This is my first strategy-card game and I was amazed at how easy it was to fall into the tactics, decks, and community. The models have the an attracitve minimalistic style which does not at all exemplify the depth and complexity the game exhibits. Coming from a Civilization 5 background, I found this game to have all the fun qualities of Civ 5's combat system (Positioning, Damage/health, special attributes), but condensed into a more competitive, short-term strategy game (compared to civ). Kk gotta git gud and build my Aggro Magmar Deck.Overall, Chess on ecstasy, 9.5/10.			"

												Pay no heed to how much time i have in this game. I just downloaded it on steam, but i've been playing it for awhile now if you go take a look at my achivements.  I just thought i should give it a review cause it deserves one. Duelysts is a Card Game where you bring your characters to life on a board. My first time playing duelysts i found that it was a very easy concept that was actually rather diffucult once you got into it. My experience with other games like hearthstone was that they were more complicated then this one is, and once you got the hang of it, rather the same more or less. You start out with a basic tutorial that will show you how to move your minions and general, and it will show you how to use your cards. After that you're basically more or less on your own if you go into online games. They have solo challenges that are diffucult enough that it takes some time to figure some of them out until you get the hang of the game a bit more, and the challenges themselves open you up to game mechanics that you probably wouldn't know that were there in the first place. Further more they have what they call the Daily Challenge in which they give you a hard puzzle to solve. Some are easier then others, but most of the time they will give you a run for your money. You get about 4 quests each day which give you gold, which you use to buy spirit orbs which give you cards. The quests are rather repetivitve, but sometimes you get a different one. as for the gameplay itself, you will lose. In this game alot of the way you win is about placement, and how you clear the board and such. When starting out you will lose, when making your way up the ranks you will lose. But you will also get better each time you do lose. You will be able to realize the mistakes that you're making, and fix them before they become too bad for you to fix, as well as recognize when your opponent makes a mistake that you can take advantage of. Basically this game to me is a 10/10 game. Free to play, and fun to play as well, with the promise of always getting better each time you press the find match button, I'd seriously reccomend this to people. Even if you don't like card games, I'd reccomend to try this one out before writing it off. Awesome game.			"

												Been playing the browser game version of this. Even though I did not like the slow clumkyness of the browser version so I left it. After some time it was on Steam and now I do not have to worry about slow load times and  bandwidth issues.In general the game is really good so far with 6 different factions a neutral side for putting in minions in all the factions.Think of this as Hearthstone but with a grid where you can actually summon units and not the cards.Quite strategic the game and there was no bloodborn spells back then for me but now there are.It is a fun free to play game with real money purchases to spirit orbs ( orbs that contain cards for deck construction )or earning gold through quests and winning games.Overall it is a must try and must play game.

												What can I say... That this game is unlike any other card game ever made! The art is absolutely stunning! You don't have to buy anything from the store, unless you're desprate, you can just save up spirit orbs. The gameplay is just, so unique that it makes me want to cry that it's finaly not a cliche and not a 50% Hearthstone copy. This game sets a whole new level of impressiveness. I can't just describe in a paragraph, guys! It's just that good! It's like TCG meets pixel games and they had a baby. If you love TCG and the classic pixel games, then this one is a must have for you! It's beautiful, amazing, and just the best that I have ever seen! If you want a good head start, here is my refer code that will give you 100 gold: zennethI hope to see you all in the game! <3			"

												First of all I really hope the devs read my review because I'll be super sincere. Sorry for the long post.Second, I play this game on my secondary account not this one.---Quick review for player in the end---For me there are only three online CCG that are worth to play: Hearthstone, Faeria and Duelyst.I played Hearthstone since beta and now I'm quitting because of the P2W fator. Even playing ever day I never pass rank 10, I belive this is the limit of F2P player on Hearthstone.So I tested Faeria and Duelyst, both are great game, much less P2W then Hearthstone once the games also make money with cosmetics. Don't get me wrong, I understand the devs must earn money so I see no problem in selling card packs for money, even though I believe Faeria and Duelyst can be a little bit generous. So, for me, the optimum point could be able have like 80% of a card expansion (without spending money) 4 or 6 weeks before the relaese of the next expansion. I'll test Duelyst until the next expansion comes to see if I'm able to do so, same goes to Faeria.Now talking about only Duelyst: It's a solid game, original, even being original you'll feel that you already now everything you must know. The matches are quick and there aren't those 2 or 3 turns where the players just pass to each other waiting to reach 3 mana cuz your starting hand is too heavy. Talking about hand you can replace one card of your hand every turn! The lore idea is super nice. Okay now we are entering the bad side: Duelyst have few problems and one big situation that isn't its fault. Duelyst doesn't have a casual mode where you can test your new decks and I'd really want to know why. Most of the game is in pixel art (some people don't like it) which I personally love. Besides that there is nothing more to complain, maybe the solo mode is too short? Or they could have introduce a coop mode (I really want it) ? But these are not negative side, the game just don't have it yet (please coop mode!!). The major problem of Duelyst is not Duelyst but the CCG genre, because of the fact you must farm gold to buy the card packs you can't play two CCG, you must choose one, it's not like playing Zelda and Horizon where you can alternate to progress in both games. For example my gf don't like hearthstone anymore, but she also don't quit to start anothe CCG cuz she don't want to lose her progress. So with this in mind I can see that on PC the CCG genre is dominated by Hearthstone and Faeria is slowly rising with new good ideas.I must say that for me Duelyst is more fun than Faeria but due to the fact of the coop anouncment I'll be forced to play Faeria on PC. NOW PAY ATTENTION: Duelyst will totally dominate the CCG mobile market when it release for Android and iOS. So, that's why I'll keep playing Duelyst too, because as a mobile experience it'll humiliate Hearthstone.More than card I belive Duelyst just need three things for now, which should not prevent you to play it: a casual mode, a coop mode and add a mobile version.--- Quick player review ---1) Pros:- Original- Easier to get ingame gold than Hearthstone- Tactical (so epic/legend cards doesnt have that impact on gameplay)- You can literally move your General on battlefield.- Lore (a lot of)- Nice art and fantasy world.- Solo mode (short, but there is one)- Factions Instead of classes- You can unlock all characters just playing- Minions create life when you play (full body and stuff)- You can buy card pack more easy than Hearstone- Expansions have less cards, so more easy to ""catch'em all""- There is some cosmetics, if you want to spend some real money to look cool- If you eventually buy the $49,99 card pack they refund you with the ingame gold that you spent previously2) Neutral- Pixel art (I love it in fact, but some don't)- Generals have no voice lines (I really don't care about it)3) Cons- Without spending money for cosmetics you must get a box of cosmetics + a key, this is a little anouying.- No casual mode so far- For me, ranged minions are a little OP.4) Veredic: If you are tired of Hearthstone or you like tactical and CCG game you must play it. Duelyst is underrated, it worth a check.Score: 9.0/10.0 (I'll give 11/10 when it has a casual and coop mode, wait for it)All the best			"

												I'd avoid this game if you plan on spending money on it. I purchased a promotional pack through the company and they denied my support claim after I had issues with the key. Their customer service pretty much told me to bugger off. It looked like a fun game, but with bad customer support, I'll take my money elsewhere. "

												This game was great until I got past the other Humble Bundle players and started playing against people that could end an almost perfect game in one or two turns. I keep losing to the same ridiculous cards that I have no means of getting myself without putting money into the game and hoping for the best. Like every other game of it's kind that I've played, the fun runs out and every time I play it I leave frustrated. If there was a reasonable way to get cards you actually want, so I could actually come up with viable decks, it might be different. For now, I can't really recommend it.			"

												I cannot recommend a game that has been crashing on me off and on since I started playing 2 hours ago. If this game intends to compete with Hearthstone then server errors either need to be fixed or managed better. I enjoyed what little gameplay I was able to try...but the constant crashes are far too frustrating, particularly when it doesn't save my progress.I want to like this game, I really do. But it needs to be functional! At least take down the servers and post a resonable notice about fixing the problems instead of allowing new players to be lured into an unstable game right after purchase.			"

												I'm not really into card games, I skipped the whole Hearthstone train, but this game really is entertaining and fun. As a fan of FF Tactics and Vandal Hearts, I can really relate to the whole depth of the game's strategy.  Even with a deck full of promising card, winning the game isn't always guaranteed. Next time somebody suggests me to do simple exercises to train my brain, I'll refer them to this.10/10 would summon flood of Wraithlings again.			"

												Needs more single player content. There isn't much to do once you reach a point where other players heavily outrank you except wait until the ranked matches reset. The Boss battles would be a fun option, but they're unbeatable without the top cards. Practice mode has no rewards. Unless you're willing to spend a lot, there isn't much here. I've only played about 10hrs, but I can't really do anything else to really progress.			"

												Duelyst is the kind of game I've been waiting for. Deck building strategy tied with grid based combat and sweet ANIMATED pizel art! Pros-Great unit variety between factions-extremely easy to earn booster packs without spending money. (I only play a couple hours a day and can easy get 2 or 3 a day based off my wins)-Beautiful, animated art.-Interesting Lore WITH AUDIO for those who don't want to read.-A large number of quick to complete solo challenges to help you learn mechanics that also reqard in game currency with each completed one.Cons- You don't draw a new card until the end of your turn which is really confusing at first.- Maps are always the same size grid, no elevation or anything like you'd see in say Final Fantasy tactics-With the option to spend money on it, there will inevitably be people with better stuff just because they dropped $20 on to a 'free' game BUT I really haven't ntoiced much disparity so far adn Devs need money to keep making cool stuff.-No ""Story"" mode which with the boat load of Lore they've developed is shocking and saddening.

												              Basically its hearthstone but where you have to do a little more work.  Your 'creatures' you summon are put on the map, each with various abilities.  You move them around tactics style, and try to just beat up your enemy.  Sounds fun, but I didn't enjoy it.  Felt too basic, much like hearthstone.  There are other games that do a much better job.  If you are trying to play casually, I recommend hearthstone over this.  If you are looking for something to sink your teeth into, Hex would be the way to go.  Hex blows almost all the other card games out of the water in my opinion (although I havn't been playing much, so it could have changed negatively)                  Unfortunately, with each of these games, there is a 'play to win' model in effect.  You can grind to where you want to go, but if you bring fat stacks and basic research to any of these online card games, you will find yourself 'pro' in no time.  Remember, this game is free, so if you are on the fence, the best way is to play it for an hour or two and decide for yourself.			"

												Really fun mixture involving the stretegy of chess and the RNG of a card game. Card packs are easy to earn, every 2 days you get enough gold to buy a pack by completing quests. Legendary cards are not too rare either, very generous, I managed to pull 13 legendaries within 50 packs. They also just release the first expansion card set, which also came with a few reworks on certain card mechanics. They also are releasing very interesting lore of the world in which this game is set. Which is a very fascinating tale also worthy of checking out :)All in all it is a very fun game with extremely nice pixel animations and artwork.			"

												I played a lot of Duelyst before it was on SteamA lot of older players complain about the free 20 orbs.Thing is, drop rates are bloody fantasticYou can get ""legendaries"" like every 5 packs, and there's a sizable chance you can get 2 at onceI built my main deck with about 10 packs I got from normal playAgain, this game has a lot of things over other games like hearthstone. It's essentially an srpg tcg, something akin to the Ps2 classic Yugioh War of the Roses. Cards are seemingly balanced (I don't know if they are or are not), so a lot of focus is on the strategic part of the game. Even basic cards are useful in some regard (Dragontooth Golem is a nice basic 10/10 card for some decks) so things like the what kind of cards you get from the draw isn't what overly matters and only help specialize your deck for something like creep spawning and board control.

												Note: I played this game long before it was on steam, so my hours played is inaccurate.6/10Short Review:-Great Art Style-Great Music-Unique Lore-Interesting Gameplay Mechanics (for a card game)-Not Pay-to-win (Better cards = win. Pay =/= Better cards. I buy orbs, but always get terrible cards)-Average Gameplay (which gets stale pretty quickly)-Not Many Gametypes-Insane Amounts of Grind Required-Buying Orbs (card packs) is not worth it-RNG RNG RNG RNG RNG and more RNGLong Review:Game of Grind:The gameplay is interesting. Has a fun concept, but the game gets stale fast as 50 percent of games are just beatdowns because one player has a deck with rarer cards. This might not apply for the higher teirs of ranked (the only multiplayer gametype), but in the high silver teir its all about who has the better cards (or top-deck shenanigans). Card games tend to be heavy on the Pay-to-Win model. However, this game is all about grinding. Honestly, (IMO) your money in this game does not go very far. You can buy orbs (packs), but most cards you get are worthless. This makes the purchase of packs unsatisfying. The crafting system is nice, but the exchange rate for cards through crafting is terrible. De-crafting cards gives you basically nothing compared to its original value. The main way of getting cards is through a quest system. By doing all the daily quests, you can recieve a single pack every 2 days. This makes making a deck of 40 cards incredibly boring. The draft mode is decent and can net you some cards, but its not radicaly different from the standard ranked matchmaking. The story is slightly above average and unique, considering it is a card game. The lore is creative, and the voice acting is awesome. The lore's only issue (IMO) is the characters have little depth, so its hard to feel connected or invested in the story. The art style in this game is FANTASTIC. I love the background art, and the pixel art is unrivaled. The music in the game is epic and builds an amazing atmosphere for a card game.This game is a joy to experience due to the uniqueness of its style (the art, music, lore, and game mechanics), but over time it loses its luster because of the slow progression (In a card game its important to be able to build a deck, so the player can grow attached to cards and in turn grow attached to the card game as a whole. However, if you cant build a deck because you only get 5 cards every 2 days, then the whole card game aspect is lost). One improvement to the game I want to see is a way to control the cards you get from orbs. For example the orbs could be faction specific with 3 cards guarenteed to be a certain faction (the last 2 would be random). By doing this cards (which are faction specific) could be easier to obtain, and deck building would be much easier/faster. Also, buying orbs would be more worthwhile as you can actually get what you want (to a certain extent) from the orbs you buy. I hate buying orbs, and only recieveing cards for a faction that I NEVER use (basically I paid money for something I will never use). Yea, I could de-craft then re-craft cards I want (as long as they are low rarity), but the exchange rate is trash and overall not even worth the effort.			"

												At first glance, it seems like a complete rip off of hearthstone. it has the same mana mechanic, it has the same card system, it has the same shop, except bigger. And it has foil cards, which serve no real purpose as I've seen yet, except to be disenchanted for more dust... i mean spirit...Yes, at first glance, this review might also seem skewed to be against this game, you would be wrong.While as of this moment, Songhai faction is very strong, the game does seem to try to be balanced. A bit 'more' balance would be nice, as well as some other avenues to utilize cards that I can only assume will be implimented later on.This game actually draws more from Fire Emblem. For those commanders out there who, like me, enjoyed spending an hour on one mission, to do a 'perfect' run, where backstabs reigned supreme and the rock paper scissors of spears swords and so on got our blood boiling in all the good ways.Well... you may not be disappointed too much by this game. While it is still 'early' since so far, as of this review, there's only one expansion to the 'Core' set of cards, which I call Shurima~ There is a backstab mechanic, opening mechanics like in hearth, spells and special abilities like in FE and Hearth.Overall, it does have a lot to offer, and it 'DOES NOT LIE' when refering to itself as a ccg with a strategy spin, I would greatly reccomend this game to anyone who likes card games, or strategy. The pixel art is not too bad honestly. it reminds me a lot of the Undertale attempts. So far, the only frustration new players might face, is asking themselves if they should save up for packs from the shop, or use gold for Gauntlet Runs (Gauntlet is basically Arena) the rewards are not too bad, in that you get Spirit for crafting, and usually a core pack along with gold. As long as the people behind this game pay attention to community feedback, and keep adding things for us to buy, and new cards for us to test strategies with, I can see this game lasting quite a while.My one big wish for this game, would be cooperative play, with a friend. 2v2... that would be so amazing if they could pull that off. Perhaps doubling the board size, or something. But if they did that, I would be so happy.			"

												Another game that shows why Steam needs a mixed rating. I enjoy playing for free with the daily challenges and single player, which act as standalone puzzles that don't require any grinding or payment. On the monetization side, I'm echoing the voices about how shady the promotional tactics are.The Humble Bundle new account creation promo for 3 free $10 card packs isn't actually that big of a deal, but what shakes my confidence is how they marketed discounted booster packs beforehand.It actually doesn't take that much time to get to that point, though maybe that's a red flag in its own way. There's perhaps an understandable catch-22 with that situation. If the 3 card packs were easy to grind for, why the hell are they $30? If the 3 card packs were hard to get on the other hand, existing players just got burned.  As is, the issue is less about new accounts having an advantage, and more of the store having questionably expensive items.But again, as long as you have realistic expectations for the F2P nature of multiplayer, the single player challenges are quite fun. Matchmaking for completely new accounts is also not a bad experience since you'll be matched with other newbies, but I hear that higher tiers begin to reveal the typical pains of any collectible games that allow grinding with time or paying for boosts.

												I really recommend playing this, it's a great ccg in general and every day there's a puzzle you can do for free gold. You get daily quests other than that aswell. There's a great variety of different heroes you can play with different playstyles. The only thing i would say could currently improve, The AI. It doesent take care of threats most often even if it would be lethal on your turn. Either way great game and hope you enjoy it. ;)			"

												Really fun mixture involving the stretegy of chess and the RNG of a card game. Card packs are easy to earn, every 2 days you get enough gold to buy a pack by completing quests. Legendary cards are not too rare either, very generous, I managed to pull 13 legendaries within 50 packs. They also just release the first expansion card set, which also came with a few reworks on certain card mechanics. They also are releasing very interesting lore of the world in which this game is set. Which is a very fascinating tale also worthy of checking out :)All in all it is a very fun game with extremely nice pixel animations and artwork.			"

												I backed this game on kickstarter on the idea that it would be a turn based strategy game. I was thinking Warhammer, Pox Nora, or Advance Wars. What's here is Hearthstone with awkward positional mechanics.If you're looking for a Hearthstone that's not Hearthstone, then you've found one. If you're looking for another bottomless CCG videogame that demands all of your time and money to remain competitive, then you've found that too.			"

												An incredibly well designed, fun and addictive tactics/collectible card game. Very, very solid gameplay with frequent updates and balance changes (roughly twice a month). A ton of collectible cards, incredible 8-bit graphics and A VERY FRIENDLY player base. Seriously, people on here are kind, helpful and not toxic which was a pleasant surprise. Fun daily quests. At first glance the gameplay may seem easy to get into, with it being very friendly to newcomers but it's actually quite in-depth and sophisticated. Hands down the best card/tactical game I've played in a while. The fact that it got me hooked for hours and hours the very first day I found about it speaks for itself.Do you like Magic: The Gathering? Do you like Hearthstone? Do you like Heroes 3? Do you like strategic games that require careful positioning and tactical thinking? Wellp, look no further - Duelyst is the game for you!10/10 gorgeous game			"

												A very interesting take on the genre that combines the normal card collecting formula and having it all take place on a 5x9 hexgrid, emphasizing the importance of positioning your minions appropriately as well as determining when to push up with your general or make a tactical retreat.As for the free to play formula; it's very generous. In comparison to games such as Hearthstone; the gold rate is very high and the drop rate for legendaries is about four times as often; however, that is offset that every card can have up to 3 cards in a 40 card deck, regardless of rarity.I'd definitely recommend checking out the game; if only just to try it. The game is generous in the begining with handing out gold and it also provides various challenges that are akin to chess challanges, discovering how to find lethal and rewarding the player for succeeding while learning in the process and getting accustomed to the hexgrid style gameplay.

												Great game for people looking for a more interactive card game. Not pay to win but you can pay to get more cards if you want to support devs but not needed to win as you get gold(in game currency) as you play. Like if chess and a card game had a baby. use refferal code: mutetheloud (get 100gold at start of game, which is enough money to buy a card pack that will give you 5 cards with one being rare or better) thank you for reading.

												This is hands down one of the best strategy based games that I have ever played. I know people say this is like hearthstone, but for me it reminds me more of magic the gathering than anything. If this game came out in the 1990's I would have lost my mind. From a 90's perspective It could only be described as Heros of Might and Magic and Magic the Gathering came together to form a brilliant fussion of strategic gaming. The online pvp (season play) is great. I think if anyone is a fan of turn based strategy or any card game based on magic the gathering, this is a no brainer. Download this. I think everything unlocks by normal play, but you can obviously buy in game curency to unlock. 9/10. Would been a 10 but I had only found out about this game now.			"

I am a daily Hearthstone player and that might change after jumping into this title. I enjoy the art direction, pixelation rocks. I also think that the factions are cool and well developed. The card powers are well thought out and leaves room for endless deck customization. I can see myself playing this game for at least 100 hours. The gameplay is smooth and complex enough to keep me interested. The UI/UX brings fun and elegance.One of the best designs Ive seen in quite sometime. 10/10 GOTY			"

												This game is an incredibly enjoyable Hearthstone-Like game.It adds another layer of strategy as you place your minions on the battlefield and controle them. Your general is also Controllable.There are different factions with some cards exclusive to their factions but there are also a big number of neutral cards.In addition to regular daily quests like ""play 4 games as Faction X"", ""Deal X damage in one game"", ""Kill X minions in one game"" etc. It also offers a daily challenge, which is a scenario in which you have to defeat the enemy in one turn with the cards available to you. There are also a number of Challenges that serve as an ""advanced"" tutorial, teaching you some mechanics.I found it rather easy to get the gold for Spirit orbs, which contain 5 cards each and at least one rare. But I also got a number of epics and just this morning(although that was big luck probably? 2 Legendaries in one Orb. Averaging out on about 4 legendaries in the roughly 20 orbs I opened so far.Some epics will be awarded to you for the beginner quests and upgrading your faction ranks. Upgrading your faction will also award you some of the basic cards of that faction, as well as an additional Commander at level 10.What I don't like is that there is the regular pvp mode is also the Ladder mode. This means if you want to try out a new deck you can only try it against the rather easy AI or risk your season ranking(I dont really mind but some people might). "

												Been playing this game before the steam release. It's awesome. Best CCG / Strategy game right now!Big emphasis on skill, having better or more cards in your collection doesn't guarantee you success. It's all about tactis and strategy. Skill is the name of the game here.Very F2P friendly, if you invest time in it. You get gold easily with quest and winning rewards. It uses the same monetazation model as Hearthstone but it's easier to get packs.This game also has a game mode were you create a deck from scratch without taking into account your collection. The more wins you rack in this mode, the bigger your reward.Also, an expansion is coming next week and i'll re-review this by the time it goes live.10/10 for me, if you like card games and strategy!

												Actually has a nice gameplay. Feels like a perfect mix between Hearthstone and a standard trading card game. Matchmaking works perfectly and it's really nice for when you have an hour to kill or you have some time left since the matches (""only"") take about 10 minutes. Though I would love an ingame chat so you can chat with your enemy while playing and I think it's rather hard to earn money so you either stick with your cards or pay real money but I guess that's exactly the point.But still very nice game.Would rate it 8/10			"

												This is hands down one of the best strategy based games that I have ever played. I know people say this is like hearthstone, but for me it reminds me more of magic the gathering than anything. If this game came out in the 1990's I would have lost my mind. From a 90's perspective It could only be described as Heros of Might and Magic and Magic the Gathering came together to form a brilliant fussion of strategic gaming. The online pvp (season play) is great. I think if anyone is a fan of turn based strategy or any card game based on magic the gathering, this is a no brainer. Download this. I think everything unlocks by normal play, but you can obviously buy in game curency to unlock. 9/10. Would been a 10 but I had only found out about this game now.			"

												I love this game! Day 1 and it is already one of my favorite games of the decade.What a refreshing suprise to stumble upon, it gives new life to TCG genre. I am a daily Hearthstone player and that might change after jumping into this title. I enjoy the art direction, pixelation rocks. I also think that the factions are cool and well developed. The card powers are well thought out and leaves room for endless deck customization. I can see myself playing this game for at least 100 hours. The gameplay is smooth and complex enough to keep me interested. The UI/UX brings fun and elegance.One of the best designs Ive seen in quite sometime. 10/10 GOTY			"

												This game is an incredibly enjoyable Hearthstone-Like game.It adds another layer of strategy as you place your minions on the battlefield and controle them. Your general is also Controllable.There are different factions with some cards exclusive to their factions but there are also a big number of neutral cards.In addition to regular daily quests like ""play 4 games as Faction X"", ""Deal X damage in one game"", ""Kill X minions in one game"" etc. It also offers a daily challenge, which is a scenario in which you have to defeat the enemy in one turn with the cards available to you. There are also a number of Challenges that serve as an ""advanced"" tutorial, teaching you some mechanics.I found it rather easy to get the gold for Spirit orbs, which contain 5 cards each and at least one rare. But I also got a number of epics and just this morning(although that was big luck probably? 2 Legendaries in one Orb. Averaging out on about 4 legendaries in the roughly 20 orbs I opened so far.Some epics will be awarded to you for the beginner quests and upgrading your faction ranks. Upgrading your faction will also award you some of the basic cards of that faction, as well as an additional Commander at level 10.What I don't like is that there is the regular pvp mode is also the Ladder mode. This means if you want to try out a new deck you can only try it against the rather easy AI or risk your season ranking(I dont really mind but some people might). "

												I like the card and character art. It also feels pretty balanced so far as a noob, I haven't gotten frustrated or felt like someone else beat me because they bought cards. It's very polished, even the UI. The main thing I like about it is that it's different from all the other CCGs: you summon the creatures from your cards onto the grid-based battle fiend. You then move the creatures into position and attack. Way more fun than the usual card vs. card effect, both from a visual as well as a tactical standpoint.			"

Imagine Hearthstone and Chess together...NOW GET THOSE MADAFAKAS  AWAY CUZ IT AINT NOTHING LIKE THOSE! LMAO!SERIOUS REVIEW!!!The one thing I like about Duelyst is the [Daily Challenge] feature. Basically, it's a minigame where they set up this situation where you have a lethal combo in your hand and the board itself. Now, it's up to you to pull off that one turn lethal move!What I'm saying is that this minigame preserve your gameplay mechanics (or in other words, it keeps your game level in tip-top shape).I'm gonna be honest, figuring out on how to get that lethal combo was stressful af. It made me wanted to quit! You'll think that this is some bs challenge that you'll never beat......but HOHOHO! Once you FINALLY figured it out, you'll get this SWEET SWEET feeling like you are the biggest smartass in the world.Overall, it's an awesome game and don't worry, it is super beginner friendly too.

												Way more control over your strategy compared to hearthstone due to being able to replace 1 card each turn. Tactical grid allows for more ways to gain advantage even with weaker deck/hand. All hearthstone analogies aside, it's a mixture of poker and chess, where you look for a good card combination in your hand, while trying to outmaneuver your enemy on a tactical grid.Artstyle is stunning, both pixel fx and overall concept art. Another pretty cool, though not crucial, feature is a codex menu with a bunch of short narrated lore entries that go with unique soundtracks and artworks and new ones get added once in a while with game updates. Can't praise this game enough, highly recommended.			"

												Played before it came to Steam and loved it. Waiting for the mobile version to come out so I can play more often but I like it a lot more than Hearthstone. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a new TCG and if you enjoy tabletop-style games. Some people find the pixel art in game unappealing but I enjoy it. It's definitely worth a try since this game is still rolling out new content and you'll be able to see it grow and progress from the very beginning. Requires no money spending to get new cards as ingame currency is pretty easy to get from quests.			"

												This is my favorite CCG, hands down. The replace mechanic and combat grid give Duelyst a tactical edge that mitigates luck elements. And almost everything is competely free if you're willing to grind.Pros: - Unique presentation - Beautiful art - Lore, for those who wish to read it - Full control over deck construction and playstyle - Easily obtainable booster packs - Basically everything that was good about Hearthstone, and much more - Short wait times; lots of active players - Fair match-making puts emphasis on playing well instead of paying money for better cards - Ability to tip loser for a good game - Only two card sets are out right now, so collecting isn't overwhelming yet. - No faction pairings seem grossly unbalancedCons: - Currently, there is no free way to unlock loot crates past your first one. Since loot crates are the prize for competing in the season ladder, this really needs to change. - No way to express certain vital emotions like ""shrug"" or ""sorry"" without paying real money or lots of in-game currencyIt's free. Try it for a few hours and see if it tickles ya. If you're looking for a deeply tactical CCG, this should be on your list.			"

												English:A-M-A-Z-I-N-GMore than 50 hours during beta and release. If you like card games you will love this. Chess + Hearthstone without the cons of HS (money money money and RNG).If you're not convinced of the pixel animations, shake off that damn prejudice and download it, when you test the gameplay not only won't care about animations you will begin to like them and you will observe carefully all of them.A large and great community that like being part of with tournaments for beginners and more advanced in which anyone can participate.Between the daily rewards and gold for play the game, in a month you will have a good collection to make decks. I paid the initial offer pack of 10 euros (one time purchase) to support developers, which are very active in Reddit and take note of feedback from players.Besides the legendary percent for orb (card pack) is higher, but that does not matter because you can reach the Golden League (level 10) without legendary and a OP deck, you only need your deck makes sense and cover the weaknesses you may have.Do not forget to look for a single-use code to get an orb (card pack) free to start (there are everywhere).See you on the board !!Spanish: I-N-C-R-E-I-B-L-EMás de 50 horas en beta y su release. Si te gustan los juegos de cartas este te encantara. Ajedrez + Hearthstone sin los fallos que tiene el HS (mucho dinero y RNG).Si no te convencen las animaciones pixelados...sacudete ese maldito prejuicio y bajatelo, cuando pruebes la jugabilidad no solo no te importarán menos las animaciones si no que te empezarán a gustar y te fijaras en todas ellas.Una gran comunidad de la que gusta formar parte con torneos para novatos y para más avanzados en el que cualquiera puede participar.Entre las recompensas diarias y el oro por jugar en un mes tendrás una buena colección con la que hacer mazos. Yo pagué la oferta inicial del pack de 10 euros (compra de una sola vez) para apoyar a los desarrolladores, los cuales son muy activos en Reddit y toman nota del feedback de los jugadores.Además el porcentaje de legendarios por orbe (sobre) es más elevado, pero eso da igual porque puedes alcanzar la Liga de Oro (nivel 10) sin legendarios ni un gran mazo, solo necesitas que tu mazo tenga sentido y cubrir las debilidades que pueda tener.No olvideis buscar un código de un solo uso para conseguir un orbe (sobre) gratis al empezar (los hay por todos lados).Nos vemos en el tablero!!

												I like the card and character art. It also feels pretty balanced so far as a noob, I haven't gotten frustrated or felt like someone else beat me because they bought cards. It's very polished, even the UI. The main thing I like about it is that it's different from all the other CCGs: you summon the creatures from your cards onto the grid-based battle fiend. You then move the creatures into position and attack. Way more fun than the usual card vs. card effect, both from a visual as well as a tactical standpoint.			"

Imagine Hearthstone and Chess together...NOW GET THOSE MADAFAKAS  AWAY CUZ IT AINT NOTHING LIKE THOSE! LMAO!SERIOUS REVIEW!!!The one thing I like about Duelyst is the [Daily Challenge] feature. Basically, it's a minigame where they set up this situation where you have a lethal combo in your hand and the board itself. Now, it's up to you to pull off that one turn lethal move!What I'm saying is that this minigame preserve your gameplay mechanics (or in other words, it keeps your game level in tip-top shape).I'm gonna be honest, figuring out on how to get that lethal combo was stressful af. It made me wanted to quit! You'll think that this is some bs challenge that you'll never beat......but HOHOHO! Once you FINALLY figured it out, you'll get this SWEET SWEET feeling like you are the biggest smartass in the world.Overall, it's an awesome game and don't worry, it is super beginner friendly too. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!			"

												Way more control over your strategy compared to hearthstone due to being able to replace 1 card each turn. Tactical grid allows for more ways to gain advantage even with weaker deck/hand. All hearthstone analogies aside, it's a mixture of poker and chess, where you look for a good card combination in your hand, while trying to outmaneuver your enemy on a tactical grid.Artstyle is stunning, both pixel fx and overall concept art. Another pretty cool, though not crucial, feature is a codex menu with a bunch of short narrated lore entries that go with unique soundtracks and artworks and new ones get added once in a while with game updates. Can't praise this game enough, highly recommended.			"

Definitely recommend if you're looking for a new TCG and if you enjoy tabletop-style games. Some people find the pixel art in game unappealing but I enjoy it. It's definitely worth a try since this game is still rolling out new content and you'll be able to see it grow and progress from the very beginning. Requires no money spending to get new cards as ingame currency is pretty easy to get from quests.			"

												[ENG] This strategic game is the perfect mix between Hearthstone and Duel of champions. The style is really awesome, every unit has its own detailed animation and also the general HUD is cool.Well, the gameplay is very simple, if you already know Hearthstone then you'll already know the gameplay of Duelyst. However, even if i enjoyed it, the common problem that affects all these kind of ""strategic"" games is the balancing of gameplay (Decks that counters certain decks, some cards too overpowered).That's why, even if i could recommend this game, i'm gonna leave this game after Hearthstone as well.These games are strategic only partially since you also have to rely on luck.[ITA] Questo gioco strategico è il perfetto mix tra il famoso gioco di carte Hearthstone e Duel of champions. Lo stile è veramente figo, ogni unità sul campo di battaglia ha la propria animazione ben curata, la grafica del menù e dell'HUD in generale è altrettanto bella.Beh, il gameplay è molto semplice e intuitivo, se già conoscete come funziona Hearthstone non avrete problemi nel giocare Duelyst visto che dal punto di vista di gameplay sono pressocchè identici.In ogni caso, anche se mi è piaciuto giocare questo titolo, il problema comune che affligge questo tipo di giochi strategici è sempre lo stesso: il bilanciamento del gameplay (Determinati deck che counterano certi tipi di deck, carte troppo potenti).Ecco perchè, nonostante possa raccomandare di provare questo gioco, smetterò di giocarci così come ho fatto con Hearthstone.Questi giochi sono strategici solo in parte, dato che bisogna sempre contare anche sulla fortuna.

												This is my favorite CCG, hands down. The replace mechanic and combat grid give Duelyst a tactical edge that mitigates luck elements. And almost everything is competely free if you're willing to grind.Pros: - Unique presentation - Beautiful art - Lore, for those who wish to read it - Full control over deck construction and playstyle - Easily obtainable booster packs - Basically everything that was good about Hearthstone, and much more - Short wait times; lots of active players - Fair match-making puts emphasis on playing well instead of paying money for better cards - Ability to tip loser for a good game - Only two card sets are out right now, so collecting isn't overwhelming yet. - No faction pairings seem grossly unbalancedCons: - Currently, there is no free way to unlock loot crates past your first one. Since loot crates are the prize for competing in the season ladder, this really needs to change. - No way to express certain vital emotions like ""shrug"" or ""sorry"" without paying real money or lots of in-game currencyIt's free. Try it for a few hours and see if it tickles ya. If you're looking for a deeply tactical CCG, this should be on your list.			"

												You might look at my profile and see I only have a handful of hours logged into the game. Yeah, I'd usually never ever write a review this early, but to be honest, I've seen enough to at least speak my mindPros:- Not pay 2 win- Like I said above, everything can be bought with enough grinding, and nothing feels like if you buy it you will instantly be overpowered- Great community! Like, wow, this community is awesome. I've had nothing but good experiences with all the forums, so if you're intimidated by the game, try not to be. This game is played by some really chill and awesome people- Great graphics that have a style all to their own- YO DAWG THE DRAFT MODE FROM HEARTHSTONE IS HERE BUT WAY BETTERCons:- Ya know, the basic stuff, like luck not liking you, not getting good cards, etc.- Currently, the races (called Generals in game) have some very clear cut things you can do with them well. There are some not so clear cut ways to use them, I'm sure, but there's this one race. THIS ONE RACE, that I ran into.- THE SONGHAI- Trust me, the race isn't ridiculously overpowered, but they have great cards, and will literally erase you from the game if you get a good one.BTW, there this referral system that's in place, it gets you 100 gold in game which allows you to buy a card pack.My referal code was already used by someone who read my review!

												Gameplay- 9/10 .  Default game cards favor empty boards for most factions.  Random elements in faction bloodsurge spells can literally turn matches into coin tosses.  Most of the time, the game plays great.  Some cards truly favor the spender, so the pay to win factor may appear, but there are divisions of players who don't own everything.Visuals - 10/10 Nothing like it, menu screen is amazing, game graphics are enjoyable and memorable, and never visually difficult or displeasing.Content - 7/10  Lack of depth to the game story, completely reliant on PvP for complete immersion.  Factions have few generals.  The game plays out in a variety of ways, but skins don't exist for factions  (as far as i know) limiting what games actually look like- so eventually the visually stunning game looks repetitive.Cost - 10/10  You can unlock the game by playing it.  The cards you are given at the beginning are fairly effective for the thrifty player.Overall 36/40 for a 90%, or A grade.  Impressive.  Fun while it lasts.			"

Unit positioning is a real thing, unlike in Hearthstone, because this works on a 2D plane rather than 1D (i.e. you move up and down as well as left and right... in Hearthstone you only worry about positioning, if ever, with left and right). Adds a lot of depth to the format and makes card games legitimately fun to play for me.			"

September 12, 2016Duelyst is a fair and free strategy game built around card usage. I emphasize the strategy elements over the card collection, as the tactical combat area really sold me on the game. Unit placement and positioning is important, and units can only attack in specified ranges. Combat feels fast, leading to well-paced matches.Duelyst is easy to pick up and play, with solid tutorials and rewarding practice options. The monetization elements are very subdued, and free players can have a great time with the game. Give the game a few hours, I'd highly recommend it.			"

Duelyst possesses great potential. Imagine playing this in a larger scale? Yes, every match would last longer, but I bet it would also be much more fun. The key is to make every players glad, even when defeated. In the last match I played, I was overwhelmed, surrounded by enemy's minions, but one of my minion managed to deal double damage to enemy's general; his hit point reduced to only one. Though I lost in the end, the experience of almost turning the battle with one single hit makes the whole gaming experience superb.			"

												Duelyst is a pretty amazing game. I didnt expect to like it as much as I do, seeing as its a card game and all, though I did enjoy playing MTG and Yugioh and such, but the elements of those games are only somewhat present in this. I couldn't directly compare the colors in magic to the generals in Duelyst, but I can find similarities. Like the Vanar, they're similar to blue. Also, if you enjoy strategy games, like Fire Emblem, or X-COM, or such, you will definitely enjoy this game.P.S: If you sign up and use someones referral code, you start with 100 gold, and they can get bonuses if you play it enough. So, the way I see it, I'll give everyone who reads this my referral code, so you can start off on a better foot in it, and if you end up liking the game, I get bonuses for helping you like it. Win-win! :DMy Referral code is ""zicatipus"". Good luck and I hope you enjoy this awesome game!			"

												Tried this game because I'm a longtime fan of both tactics and card games. The tactics portion adds a lot to the standard card game lineup, and feels like an experience not to be missed.I've started playing this a little more regularly than Hearthstone lately because the tactics portion adds a good amount of depth without things getting too crazy: Hearthstone feels like it gets solved every month or two, to the point that you can't play a fun deck, because you'll just hang out in the high-teens.  People netdeck something and it plays itself.  The positioning in this game adds a whole new way for you and your oponent to screw up, and so your fun deck is going to throw you higher.My biggest complaint here is the art. I think its fantastic pixel art, but the grid-based system causes the fantastic pixel art to not-integrate with the environment very well.  Kinda just a problem with tactics games in general - with this one stressing the point more without clever environmental interactables.Overall, grand game. Hope it keeps up. Haven't dropped a dollar on any other digital CCG besides Hearthstone, but this one caused me to open my wallet.  Haven't yet bought in too deep, but it seems pretty inevitable.			"

Hearthstone's free card packs come at about a 30% rate compared to the ones you generate going daily quests in Duelyst. Hearthstone's crafting is considerably more costly value-wise, as well. Blizzard is bad at balancing.Duelyst releases new cards every month, regularly updates imbalances in the meta (and does so fairly, regardless of what salty Vet mains will say), and really cares about its playerbase. When they added Prismatic cards to the game, people who had played before then didn't get any at first- card packs opened past that point just had more value than previously. People complained about this, and a while later they gave pre-patch players FREE prismatic cards based on how many packs they had opened previously. They could have made random cards in our collections prismatic and told us that would could enough (despite that not taking into account disenchanted cards) but they did the right thing and gave us free cards to match the value. Yes, there are a TON of purchasable cosmetic items, but let me put this to you: people who complain about having the OPTION to purchase cosmetic items and emotes in a free game are massive babies... especially when the skins and emotes are purchasable with spirit/dust for free too.

												This is crazy! Almost 60 hrs and every so often having a losing streak. BUT I CAN'T STOP playing this game. Something about tinkering the deck, turn based strategy and that ""one more game"" urge kept me coming back.Losing is not something that I felt bad about*. Most of the cards are well balanced, except for some. But that's okay. It gives you thrill every time you play. I like cheap thrills. I am cheap. And you won't get any cheaper than free. Except maybe when you buy lots of orbs to build your deck. Grumble grumble			"

												This is like a combination of hearthstone and final fantasy tactics.. or magic the gathering and chess if you prefer.. much more tactic and depth to the play and alot less of RNG.. it's a really fun game with a great community! :) havn't even logged into hearthstone for my daileys after discovering this game.. and I have played hearthstone for years and have quite an investment in that game.. I enjoy this so much more though! :)			"

												Duelyst is a pretty amazing game. I didnt expect to like it as much as I do, seeing as its a card game and all, though I did enjoy playing MTG and Yugioh and such, but the elements of those games are only somewhat present in this. I couldn't directly compare the colors in magic to the generals in Duelyst, but I can find similarities. Like the Vanar, they're similar to blue. Also, if you enjoy strategy games, like Fire Emblem, or X-COM, or such, you will definitely enjoy this game.P.S: If you sign up and use someones referral code, you start with 100 gold, and they can get bonuses if you play it enough. So, the way I see it, I'll give everyone who reads this my referral code, so you can start off on a better foot in it, and if you end up liking the game, I get bonuses for helping you like it. Win-win! :DMy Referral code is ""zicatipus"". Good luck and I hope you enjoy this awesome game!			"

												Tried this game because I'm a longtime fan of both tactics and card games. The tactics portion adds a lot to the standard card game lineup, and feels like an experience not to be missed.I've started playing this a little more regularly than Hearthstone lately because the tactics portion adds a good amount of depth without things getting too crazy: Hearthstone feels like it gets solved every month or two, to the point that you can't play a fun deck, because you'll just hang out in the high-teens.  People netdeck something and it plays itself.  The positioning in this game adds a whole new way for you and your oponent to screw up, and so your fun deck is going to throw you higher.My biggest complaint here is the art. I think its fantastic pixel art, but the grid-based system causes the fantastic pixel art to not-integrate with the environment very well.  Kinda just a problem with tactics games in general - with this one stressing the point more without clever environmental interactables.Overall, grand game. Hope it keeps up. Haven't dropped a dollar on any other digital CCG besides Hearthstone, but this one caused me to open my wallet.  Haven't yet bought in too deep, but it seems pretty inevitable.			"

												I saw this game and as in general I like card games, I thought I’d give it a try. At first I was like “meh” as it seemed pretty basic and ugly (TBH). Quickly I saw that you really need to plan and know 3-5 steps ahead what you need to do. Now I’m hooked. Give it a try and play the practice mode BUT you must get to level 7+ before you will see just how hard it can be.			"

												Awesome game. Finishing off an opponent with a huge combo is soooooo satisfying. Easy to pick up and start playing online in an hour. Requires a fair amount of reading to understand what each card does, but it's not overwhelming. Once you've done one combo you will understand how the cards interact with eachother and the rest is picking up on how the different types of opponents prefer to engage you. There seem to be some complaints about the game becoming sort of paywalled at higher levels. I haven't reached that high enough level to be able to comment on whether or not that is true, but I am truly having fun on the way to finding out. If I get to the point where I'm playing this super competitively and putting in hundreds of hours then I don't mind chipping in, but so far I don't get the feeling you need to pay an arm and a leg in order to have a good time, whatever that means to you.I haven't even explored deck building or card crafting yet and I've been able to beat other players with advanced cards while using only the premade starter decks myself. So the game is fun, challenging, and noob friendly. With the board format it really boils down to a dynamic puzzle game with an element of competition and fantasy theme. Definitely worth your time.

September 12, 2016Duelyst is a fair and free strategy game built around card usage. I emphasize the strategy elements over the card collection, as the tactical combat area really sold me on the game. Unit placement and positioning is important, and units can only attack in specified ranges. Combat feels fast, leading to well-paced matches.Duelyst is easy to pick up and play, with solid tutorials and rewarding practice options. The monetization elements are very subdued, and free players can have a great time with the game. Give the game a few hours, I'd highly recommend it.			"

 Pros -6 factions with each 2 diffrent gennerals-5 gamemodes to chose from-very nice pixel art/graphics-It has lore-addictive, enjoyable strategic gameplay-very easy and simplistic menu Cons -in my opnion the factions are not really balanced-it is a card game, and although you can buy 'card packs' with in game gold, in can understand if this game is seen as a pay-to-win game. But that is with most card games Overall I really enjoyed my time with it so far, and i hope it will stay that way.I've had a lot of fun playing against friends, but against random strangers is not that bad either.I strongly reccomend this game for startegy enthusiasts.8/10			"

												Only the beautiful and consistent artwork in this game distinguishes it from any random pay2win CCG, don't be fooled by the element of ""strategy"" of positioning units, 99% of all the new cards they add in immediately affect board state when played, rendering tactics useless and favouring a reactice style  of play, and woe betide you if you don't have the rare cards you need to react properly.It's no secret that most games are made with the objective of making money, and Duelyst is a prime example of that.Not satisfied with the money from card packs, this game also severely limits in-game player communication without spending money, to provide another avenue of profit from casual gamers.10/10 for Card design, both graphics and effects.3/10 for gameplay, 1v1 is the only game mode, only ranked available,meaning u must sacrifice your ladder points to make any deck weaker than your best race.0/10 for competitive.

												Duelyst is a CCG with a turn-based tactical combat arena.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.The art style is Pixelated, but animated and highly detailed.  Has Practice matches, PVP, Challenges.  Your General is mobile, has health of 25 and has attack and move of 2, can cast spells and summon creatures.  The arena is a 5 x 9 grid and your deck holds 40 cards.  Sort of like Cards and Castles and Hearthstone. Try it, maybe you might like it.For more info:

While it starts off slowly, and you will be losing a lot of games to begin with especially if it's your first ever card game you will grow and grow as a player and start to unlock spirit orbs (pack of 5 cards) and start winning games very quickly all while being FREE TO PLAY, and it doesnt require you to buy orbs to be good, although there is the option of that too.Not all of the great cards are Legendary or Epic; one of the best cards in the game is a common, there are plenty of Starter, Common or Rare cards which are very highly rated and can get you to the very top. Granted Legendaries are very good, but they tend to be more of a situational card than something which is insanely overpowered. What sets this aside from other card games is that there is a chess board of such, you move around the board and the cards have a life, positioning is the most important part of the game. You can have a card which can destroy your opponents General in one hit, but if you can't reach them then its useless. RNG is often a big part of card games, while there is some on here, it's limited. You start off with 5 cards in a hand and you get the chance to replace two straight away and then one from each turn onwards. If you know what you're looking for and which cards you need, it's likely you will encounter it for when you need it. + FREE TO PLAY+ Most essential cards are lower rarity+ Limited RNG+ Legendary drop rate is ~1/4+ More than just cards with a board to play on+ Very easy to get gold+ Six different factions to choose from, each with two generals which play as a different archtype- Very Bad S-Rank system (a new one is in the works)- Not as popular as other card games for nowAlso note: If you sign up with a referal, use my name (Browneskiii) to get 100 Gold for FREE. It's free, why not try it atleast? :D			"

												The main reason i don't recommend this game is the fact that no one...and i mean NO ONE plays just for fun....it's all about winning so there's absolutely no creativity to their decks, they just use everyone else's deck because it ""WINS"" a lot of the time....big deal...be your own person and make something for fun...that's the whole point of a ""game"" is fun....when someone spends 100+ $$$ on making a specific deck you're really just cheating yourself....also...the matchmaking is the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen in my life...at rank 20 i was fighting people that already had 100-300+ wins with a particular faction vs my 20+ wins....now where's the competition in that it's not even fun....

												Awesome Game! 10/10It's very much like the old Tactics game that I miss so much. This is turn-based at it's finest.It does have a Ranked system and it is done better than some other ones out there. The whole 8-bit thing is pretty neat, I would like it either way, but it would be cool to have a non-8-bit version of this game. - not really a complaint just a suggestion It's kind of arcade-like. It is sort of fast paced as well, if that makes sense because it is turn-based...Just try it if you like strategy games or card games. It is a mixture. It also has single player mode for the people that can't handle a Multiplayer game.			"

												Duelyst is a game that takes the CCG (collectible card game) and adds a tactical element to create a game that feels more rewarding to skilled players. Players have access to more tools to create consistancy in play, such as reducing the effects of poor draws by granting a system of replacing a card once a turn. The addition of a game board also gives players more tools to preserve resources, such as avoiding enemy minions to conserve health or protecting minions by body blocking or repositioning.Recommend if:- you enjoy turn-based tactics and M:tG/Vanilla HS-style games- you enjoy being rewarded for skilled play and understanding of mechanics- you like drawing multiple cards a turn			"

												I want to love this game, but it's turned into an IAP ♥♥♥♥♥how, plain and simple. As a Kickstarter backer, it's disappointing to see a promising pixel turn-based strategy game turn into an IAP saturated Trading Card Game (TCG). I summarily pulled my backing after the announcement was made.It has since become a Free2Play TCG, so I decided to give it a try. The good news is that the core gameplay is enjoyable and well paced. All the cards seem to have their place in their respective strategies. The bad news is that in order to make it free, Counterplay Games has crammed every monetization scheme possible into one game.From cosmetics to cards, if they can sell it to you, they will. Avatars, card packs, card backs, character skins, emotes and bundles can all be purchased. Cards are awarded through spirit orbs (read: card packs), which is par for the course if you consider Hearthstone the benchmark for TCGs. The final kicker though are the mysterious crates.Mysterious crates are awarded for ranking up in online play (think leveling up a la Overwatch). The problem is, in order to open a mysterious crate, you have to purchase a key (like CS:GO).Now, I don't necessarily have a problem with any of these pricing models separately, but when they're all combined into one game, it makes me cautious. And even if it can be considered forgivable on its own, Counterplay recently introduced promotional keys for 20 Orbs and Cosmetics (roughly $30 value, $20 card value), but made them only redeemable to new accounts. So if you started playing when Duelyst launched on Steam AND spent $10, you are now on par with new players that have spent nothing. Likewise, they have been ""balancing"" quests so that you earn less gold and therefore open less packs.All in all, there is an enjoyable game here, but for myself and others who are sensitive to over-monetization, I'm of the opinion that Counterplay Games is leaning heavily towards greed. But I am just a short term player, here is longer (and admittedly better) assessment from a long time player: https://forums.duelyst.com/t/an-open-letter-to-counterplay-games-ardent-dawns-post/3113 "

All of your love of strategy card gaames combined with tactical positioning, it's really fun. Hear a lot of people say it's unbalanced, but really, i feel that way about every card game when i see people throw legendaries all over. It's fun and if you rage quit because somebody spent the time to build up a nice deck, well, sorry, so sad. I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up, pixel graphics are very polished, tactics are head scratchers (<---good thing) and AI is actually not terrible. Get it, it's free.			"

 Simplistic:  So worth the time, great visuals, great learning curve, FREE and not a pay-2-win,OMGOMGOMG. --- Details:  After about an hour or so of fiddling around, I must say very impressive. 1. Art: Art style is unique, animations amazing. Can be laggy with be many minions out and with certains spells but very short bursts, really no lag. SO its lower PC friendly.2. Game Mechanics: Simple to learn; Hard to master: The tutorial is very straight forward in showing you you how to do the basic actions, but leaves you to your own decisions to figure out what is the correct play and when. Very rewarding in terms of learning each character, or a specific one. Duelysy also has a solo mission complex which have you figure out how to utilize different abilities, about three tries for each personally. :P3. Community: From my observation: Small but very friendly, managed to join the official discord and everyone had something to talk about, even met up with a new buddy and played for about 45 minutes, showing me concepts I realized on my own - through repeated play. Community is active and I really would to see it grow.4. Purchases(Is it really not a pay2win?): The game does allow you to purchase ORBS,(in-game way of unlocking cards) and other commodities for real money, but does not make you any better at the game itself.  Also as far as I can tell, everything is unlockable with SPIRIT.(Currency for crafting or purchasing new items or cosmetics{YEP, COSMETICIS.}) Final say, YES. GET THIS GAME.Also i'm not a professional reviewer anything, but this seemed so worth it to get out there with very poor free to play models on steam. Good Job, Counterplay Games Inc!			"

Unfortunately, My full review needs to sit on pastebin because of an apparent character limit on steam reviews. It's here.[pastebin.com]The short version: It's a card and board game, much like the one Han Solo and Chewbakka play on the Millenium Falcon, where they play little monsters on a board and make them fight.It's got botmatches, pvp, and 'challenges' that play more like a puzzle than a strategy game.It's got a strict meta and no casual 'unranked' pvp.It's got a cash shop, where you can buy 'orbs' (loot crates) that drop 5 cards. Obviously the more cards you have, the better. You can also buy cosmetics, but they don't affect gameplay. Cards do. Too bad. This means it's P2W. It might not be so P2W that it effects how you enjoy the game, but any change in gameplay is too much for me. Cosmetics Only.It's got a toxic community. What a shame.If you're a card-game nut, have at it. If this will be your first card game, stay away.			"

												Working unpaid overtime is more fun than playing this terribly imbalanced, disgustingly broken, shameful pay-to-win travesty landfill tripe of a game.Any so-called ""depth"" only relates to how deep your pockets are - can your 5 dollar bill beat my 10 dollar bill?As a marketing gimmick, they gave out lots of Epic/Legendary cards for breaking orbs in the beginning, but no more - you're lucky to get one for every orb you break - which will cost you real life money or 100 gold from the game. Meaning, if you're STARTING OUT NOW, you're very much in for a Digital Pigsty of garbage, losing match-ups, because your opponents will @$$r@pe you with armageddon-tier unfair cards. Nice r£tarded strategy by the devs to scale their business with a game only 3 weeks old. It's also why it's gonna tank in the next 2.Saw the title mentioned on Humble Bundle and got some free trinkets/codes with the latest bundle there, among them 20 orbs which you can break for 5 more cards to your deck. It was immediately apparent that others had done this too - good luck playing against opponents with 100 trash email accounts and the resulting 100x20 orbs they have used to top off their decks leaving the beginner phase a really rotten experience. I, for one, do not have time for such bull$hit.And this is coming from someone who isn't a fan of Hearthstone at all, but at least can admit it was objectively fair to players of all levels, thus its huge success.I gave Duelyst a few hours of my evening, whereas I should have used it for picking nose hairs with a plier, as that would have been more enjoyable. However, the time spent was enough to discover the shallow game mechanics and the awful graphics that has nothing to offer an already super-saturated market.To emphasize how utterly sloppy and bad it is: It has an ""End Turn""-button that don't turn green even when you are CLEARLY out of options. Which is a basic mechanic you should have working in this kind of game, similar to a car having basic wheels and a god damn engine. The graphics are nothing special, just a mediocre blend of pixels and smooth-style backgrounds copy-pasted from the Blizzard equivalent. On top of that some of the sounds are stolen from Diablo 2 and some of the music has been taken from other, older games.Playing was tedious and boring from the start and only got worse; I caught myself checking out what time it was more often than checking out what happened on the board, so non-engaging were the battles.Add to this that some of the players have been receiving copious amounts of spam in their inbox after registering.Stay away if you ain't got the extra money to pay, and even then you'll be bored out of your mind.

												I stopped played after a handful of matches. It is a good competitve strategy game. I hate to give this a negative review, but I wouldn't recommend it over some other similar games. I can see how the positioning aspect really adds a lot of depth compared to a more traditional CCG. But it just didn't do it for me. Also, I am not a huge fan of the pixel art. I don't mind pixel art when it makes sense. But here it just doesn't in my opinion.			"

												Early impression: I wish that +2/2 or +4/4 grow cards didn't exist when they are very hard for new players to deal with after turn 1 as each turn usually has new players closely trying to outvalue each other with rather low hp minions on board and no dispel or destroy cards to get rid of them. sometimes you also get those 5 turn victories because of poor draws of the enemy and more than often your losses in constructed come from simply not having enough dispel or value to counter the enemy (as high value/dispel/removal cards rarely come up for you to pick).otherwise the game is fun and while there are a lot of cards that feel unbalanced, there is more strategizing involved compared to many other f2p card games - and that makes the game worth playing for some time. Edit: Played for longer and now I'm facing veteran players with custom decks when playing with starting decks, where people have cards with 2x more value than mine. I could summon 2 or 3 mana 2/3s with an effect, but the enemy has 0/6 2 mana totems that summon a 2/2 monster every turn or 2 mana 2/2 Pax that on death summon 2 2/2 dervishes for a total of 6/6 value as THREE monsters  against my (typically) low hp monsters (best probably fenrir warmaster for 6/4 value. Dispels do not have enough value to counter these kind of rush type minions especially when combined with buffed ranged minions because they use all the starting mana, a card from your action bar AND still leave the enemy minions with their original attack/hp values - giving no draw to keep up (and then you have to deal with distance of the ranged enemies or find a dispel for them as well). These are just some examples.The game snowballs too easily and constructed requires heavy RNG in getting to choose cards that synergize and fit the meta. because of requiring a lot of grind to be able to fight against custom high value decks and a lot of rng to do well in constructed, I don't recommend playing more than up to level 11 casually on each class.

												Finally, a F2P game that cares about it's users and their experience over cash flow. Games like this are far and few between. Newbie friendly, visualling appealing and simplistic, it offers so much in terms of gameplay. From PVP ladder to stimulating daily challenges to rapid fire ""gauntlet"" games, you never get bored. With so many factions and endless possibilities in deck composition, this game gives you the depth you need as either a casual or invested player. Plus, drop rates are WAY better than Hearthstone. I have nothing but good things to say. Regarding the issue with giving new players $20 of new stuff and nothing for us older players, I don't give an eff because I'll toast them anyways. Deuces.			"

												Looking at this title you may remember games that allow the player to use strategy, creativity, and above all confusion to defeat your enemy. None of that is reflected in this game. I fought only one type of enemy, one type of strategy, and lost every time because I refused to use it too. These online card games are all the same: there's no room for creativity. In other games because cards are too hard to get, in this game because no card can challenge the dominating strategy. I still swear by the cancelled Scrolls game, there were none like it.			"

												This is a good concept, a great idea, but with one flaw, Songhai is overpowered as hell, nothing can compete. The balance of this game is so horrid, so awful, There's no use picking anything but Songhai, Their spells are way too strong, it's so easy just to range♥♥♥♥ you from across the map, with their ability to summon a 1/1 minion with range, and all the powerful ranged monsters, and all the songhai specific spells that synergize perfectly with ranged.If they were to nerf songhai, i'd definitely try this again, but when they nerf Vanaar and don't change Songhai at all, It shows some clear bias.

												great game and one of the better balanced games that i have seen in a while, and while the graphics and cards are unique and fun to play with they most certainly have some balancing issues with thier cards and factions. some factions posses cards that let them permanently control any unit. late game this is extreemly frustrating and difficult to manage as you will spend all of your points to summon a powerful monster and next turn the enemy will swoop in with a less powerful card and permanently take your monster. any game that lets a single faction permanently take control of creatures will inherently have balancing issues in my opinion. aside from that, there is a specific faction in the game that has the best starting units and by best they have the highest overal attack and health compared to cost letting them dominate early game and defeting most faction which are designed to last mid to late game. the chess board style as well as the summoning of cards and unique abilities makes the game very strategic and enjoyable. like i said earlier balancing issues certainly get frustrating to deal with but hopefully things will be changed.

												Ha... F2P more Like P2W. U cant get cards unless you pay real money. The ""ingame"" way of getting those cards is by winning games, it gives you 5 gold or something like that . You need 100 to get 5 cards . And thats only if you win.---: Update :--Thats right, installed it couple of days ago , if you calculate it its 1 pack ever day/ day and a half as i said if you win.( if you play all day long )Its seems kind of hard to fight people that bought all the cards but hey everyone has their opinion right ,i might be bad at it ...  First win is 15gold the rest is 5gold / 2win I wrote this because it really bothered me that such a nice game was so♥♥♥♥♥♥(You have to buy emojis  )PS:Dont take it personally... oh nearlly forgot , whats up with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics?@blot			"

												I ran into so many issues within just 24 minutes of ""playing"" the game that I think I might just quit right away, sorry...Without even playing the actual game appart from the 3 first tutorials, which was clunky and really not that informative at all, you know... getting 5 cards being told you can swap out 2 of them but the tutorial just lets you swap out only one exact card so it can continue the script and give you 2 artifact spells which say ""0 mana to cast"" but you can only cast 1 ... because the tutorial just wants you to use ONLY 1 right now and then insist on you doing some other stuff, making you think ""oh so I can only use 1 artifact per turn ok"" but thats not true because when you try doing 2 per turn later on it just works like a charm. and the tutorial displays a huge textbox above the head of a card telling you to play it but that exact same textblock just blocks your sight so you can't even see what the cards description below says. So you end up being forced to play a card that you can't even find out about what it does at all...So In terms of ""teaching"" me stuff about the game the tutorial just failed alot. Just so so many very basic things going terribly wrong here, again before you even start playing at allNext, the humble keys I got did have a space you had to delete after copy pasting them which took me like 2 minutes to find out by using google which included comments by the actual support/dev/publisher... I dunno (yellow name with an admin star, whatever that means in detail, like... is he a steam Admin, Dev Team Member, Support Admin, Publisher Staff?)https://steamcommunity.com/app/291410/discussions/0/343787283744745839/but what I'm trying to say: if it takes a user just a few moments to figure, then why doesn't it say so somewhere at humble bundle or as a side note at where you put in the keys?2nd: after finaly getting the codes to work, well at least it told me they worked by showing some green marker and then... well just... where is it? Where can I see what I just unlocked? I browsed through all of the game menus multiple times and I cant find any display for these ""cosmetic"" contents that I assumably just unlocked. And for the second key which should have added some currency ""spirit orbs"" well... under the crafting menus I found some display saying I still have ""0 spirit"" dunno if that would refer to ""spirit orbs"" tho but ye... where is the stuff?And pls dont get me wrong here, I'm not ranting about pretty much free stuff that I should just be thankful for if anything and keep my mouth shut. No I'm talking about a glimpse of experience into the premium content of a game that I might have wanted to play and get some $$$ shizzles for in the future, but when I cant see that stuff anywhere at all, then its simply not worth a single future penny!Anyway, I thought maybe I'd have to restart the client to refresh all the displays (which would be sad enough for a released state game of 2016) but that brings us to:3rd, just on my SECOND EVER attempt to start the game it just locked itself in that very first black screen with the white ""Duelyst"" logo and it didnt even allow me to simply go to my desktop and shut it down - so it kind of soft locked my entire system which I really dont like at all (which is also partial a Win10 issue but ye... lets say 50/50 on that one)not to mention I still cant see any of the added items after being able to start the game in the end.So all I really wanted to say is: I've seen some potential but before I got even started I'm not really feeling an urge to start the game a 4th time ... ever, because first impressions you know...And I know the game is F2P but thats just the point, if you run a F2P you obviously rely on cosmetics, boosters and other premium microtransactions but when a player can't even get any visual feedback from purchases people just won't buy it...PS: When I try to verify my e-mail to the account using the link from my e-mail I just get redirected to a site telling me that my current browser (Firefox) is not supported and I should install CHROME?! like what?! chrome?! are you serious guys? ANY other game or account I ever tried to verify to within the last like... years would just provide me with a code within verification emails which you can then put into some form if provided links refuse to work but ... CHROME?!			"

												Ignoring all the reviews from people who were caught out by the free humble bundle intro pack, Duelyst is a terrific game. I've dabbled in a few TGC's before, Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone etc and this game feels pretty awesome to play. 6 factions with many different playstyles within them, awesome animated pixel sprites, not too much of a grind to buy card packs or 'spirit orbs', at least in comparison to other games like Hearthstone, and awesome visuals and sound design. The game is easy and quick to get into, yet hard to master. 10/10			"

												Verdict: Don't waste your time with this game.Pros:This game can be fun. I didn't see the draw at first, but it started becoming fun as I played many practice rounds.Cons:The Cons become apparent as you begin playing enemy players.This is a pay2win game. Either players have invested money to get brutally stronger deck builds or have spammed the free gold/orbs e-mail deal. Needless to say, anyone trying to get into the game will not have much fun.Next, one has to really delve into the game play and type. In a nut shell, it's nothing new. Duelyst does not offer any new ideas or new play styles. It copies straight off of many games fram flash gaming websites.Lastly, I'd like to point out their art in general. It's...slightly amateur. I don't know who they're hiring to do them, but they're not top tier artists. The pixel art are ""off"" slightly. The way they have done it looks complex, but at the same time looks awful. They just look like blurred blobs with detail in them. The splash art for generals are also rather odd. Their proportions are off, shading is off, just things here and there are slightly off. I'm sure they're hiring these artists to save a buck or two.			"

												Pretty broken game to be honest.  I am well versed in trading card games.  But say if you make a 2 mana card an 0/6 that creates 2/2 every turn.  And everyone else needs to pay 2-3 mana just for a 2/2 3/2 2/3.  Then you have a broken card that needs to cost more mana, I cant believe they even let that through.  Not to mention in the same match I first saw that, an iron golem 2/2 creature, in 1 turn magically somehow had provoke, +1+2, +2+2, AND takes no damage from generals.  Provoke+no damage from generals?  Broken.From what I saw, you cannot check what your opponent used to do things, so if they go real fast, you literally have no idea if they are cheating, or just have all the OP cards or what.  I would pull an AVGN on the cartridge if I could.			"

												Fun game. Decent mechanics, passable art.My main issue with it is that new players will have an extremely hard time considering that alot of the players I've been matched against seems to summon/play legendaries every 3-4 cards while all you'll have are basics. In itself this wouldn't be much of an issue but said players will more or less know what cards you have/can play while everytime they summon something new you'll take a few seconds reading it and trying to figure out what it does. All in all, would've been great if it released with even footing rather than leaving older players with their card advantages.			"

You can spawn a ""deathwatch"" minion which gains +1/1 when ANYTHING dies, which is extremely broken when you can force 6-10 or more of your 1/1 minions that passively spawn, to kill themselves in one turn. Giving that low cost ""deathwatch"" minion god-like powers. Broken. Especially since your general (the thing you kill to win) is max health at only 25HP.I wanted to play this to have fun but it left me frustrated at how I was losing because of skilless hack moves, just a cheese fest of using op cards with no real thought given to gameplay or strategy.

												This game started out great when I first played it. But ever since the recent patch, I've continued to lose match after match after match, and I know its not because my deck is bad. I'm using one the best decks I've ever built and I've won several games with it. So why now am I losing all my matches all of the sudden? It feels as if Counterplay themselves are rigging the game to make it so I lose all my matches. I hate to be that guy who blames the problems on the developer, but unless all the matches are being hacked by the other player (very unlikely, but not impossible), that's the only answer I have. I hope the developers aren't doing what I fear and favoring my opponents. I know some people are gonna read this and say ""You just suck. Get a better deck."" Fine, say what you like, but that won't change my opinion on this situation. If it turns out that Counterplay is not involved, then I will immediatly take down this review. But until I'm certain, here it is.			"

												Free to play P2W. not enough season brackets. no campaign. extremely grindy. play area is tiny for ranged, all commanders move at the same speed making the more powerful cards worth much more. initial draw seems to be 90% chance it will force a high cost card on you, or three cards that are junk. After the initial draw you can only replace two of the crummy cards you get so you are SOL if you draw all high costs, or all spells or something like that (the game states you can not recycle a card and draw it again... I call bs). While playing note that the game is not using a traditional deck or draw. you can draw any card for any of your draw phases and good luck getting the cards you need even if half your deck is dispel. I enjoy it because I have disposable income, but this game is brutal, prepare to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the bronze league, and silver league.

It's like playing basketball but if you pay 2 euros or dollars, you can get points by just hitting the backboard and yet if another player pays 4 euros or dollars then you get only 1 point for scoring. So in the end you are not measuring the competence between players but their wallets.			"

												As much as I love this game I have to give this a negative review, please bear with me.Pros:Great GameplayMore skill based and less RNG/P2W [Keep in mind this is still a CCG]Good reward system to stimulate playQuick growth to better cardsAMAZING graphicsCons:Shady DevsF2P [Many might consider this a pro but to me this has always been a red flag. There's a saying you get waht you pay for.]If you think you might be interested you should honestly try it, but be careful if you decide to invest money.I'm not sure how much you've heard about the devs but they certainly don't seem to care about their loyal fans, just their bits. From misleading them in updates to gipping them with the HB... I won't go into detail but if you'd like to read about it a dedicated fan has written a letter about it (the Humble Bundle gip isn't mentioned in it).https://www.reddit.com/r/duelyst/comments/50paxs/an_open_letter_to_counterplay_games/ "

												DISCLAIMER: if you like this game then good for you, more power to ya, but for me it was not good enoughfor a recommendationNow before you blindly downvote i just want to make a point. I do not, by any means, hate this game. This would be 7 or even 8/10, but there were multiple problems. The battle system, although strategic, lacks dimension. Although skill plays a major part, i feel like having better cards almost decides the match before it begins, skill only affecting the means of the outcome, rather than the outcome itself.One other problem I have is, although the games art style is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing (I love it SOOOOOO MUCH) and reminds me of games like kingdom, the graphics can lag the game even when i fullfill minimum requirements and set the settings to low. (maybe there were better optimizations,or the ability to disable the shaders chadows and lighting entirely?) On top of that, the game lacks resolution settings, making my tiny monitor a huge hinderance and slowing down gameplay. If these issues are fixed, or even just one, I would be happy to change this review to a thumbs up. But, for me, the game in its current state is unplayable, so I will be sticking to Fire Emblem.P.S. If you bear a similar opinion to me, or just plain like this game, I highly suggest checking out Fire Emblem.			"

I was pretty Hyped to try the game after all the reviews I saw, too bad the game is broken =(According to steam I have 35 minutes played, yet I never actually made it into the game. Hopefully the devs fix the game as I would love to give it a shot. I will try to download and reinstall in a few months if I see there are any updates. But at this point I can't honestly recommend the game. If you look around the forum, My issue is a common one. Stay away until the game is fixed! I have spent 2 hours of my life trying to get this game to run with no success! don't be like me! Go play a game that actually loads!			"

												It is a great game but I have to dislike since server lag heavily in multiplayer. I have been playing for 2 days now and after maybe 50 games only 20 or so were going smooth. I googled the problem and found that a lot of people complained about this 6 months ago, 5 months ago ect.. Dev said back then it was due to beta reasons. But it is released now and I dont see any solution. For me it seems more a server saving money reason. Once the lags are gone I certainly will give it a like here but not now. 6 months are enough to solve such a problem.			"

												Duelyst is a fun game as every game can be. If you like Heartstone you probably like this. It's not that tedious to get cards, but it sure is not worth your time if you want to keep farming those gold coins for hours to get your 10 minutes of fun. After your 10 minutes you will get recked by those who have decided to buy their spirit orbs with their milk money. This is my view of the game. This is what I experienced.It might be due RNGJESUS who keeps screwing around with me.My experience in short is this: It's like playing Yu-gi-oh replaced with money bills.

												preface for downvoters: you should be ashamed of yourself automatically downvoting all negative reviews. and you are not really helping yourselves either since every new player that comes here and sees this will know that only a fanboy would downvote a sensible and logical review.i have everything for the game and have played the beta a bit.it is just another ccg with a couple of innovative ideas. but it has also copied the class system from hs which makes it very very boring. see with magic color system people can match up a lot of different cards and make fun decks. here you have classes and basically most classes have 1 deck that is competitive and the rest... well, though luck. so basically there are 2-3 viable decks but even they are very rock-paper-scissorish between each other so you generally just run thru the motions to get your ensured win or loss.and of course the mechanics are pretty shallow since there are units don't have multiple abilities/attacks, no instants, no permament resource cards (like lands in magic) nor is there any hand manipulation, deck manipulation, graveyard...bottom line is that hs embraces the whole rng thing and that is fine. it is what it is. i have complete collections in both and sometimes i like kicking it in hs and others in mtg. this game is basically hs without the fun rng, magic without the fun mechanics, and a turn-based squad combat without fun multiple attacks/abilities for each unit.keep in mind that thumbs down is not 0/10 or whatnot. it is not even 5/10, probably 7 or even 8/10.  the situation with online ccgs is basically like mobas. you trully have to deliver something amazing and probably still not going to get a thumbs up or get big which is very important for a game such as this since tournaments, deck ideas, content updates, are only possible if the game is super succesful which unfortunately duelyst will never be.

												The metagame is combo-based. You draw your 2 or 3 card combo out of 40 card deck - they lose. otherwise - you lose. It's that simple. Sure, there are control decks that just stall the board until they get their cards, or rush that say ""your deck has to have at least 1/4 of provoke or healing effects, otherwise you lose"". But in the end it's just that - you draw your combo or they do. Lots of anger comes from this.But the daily quests are easy to do and the fights themselves are not long that's definately a plus. The graphics are well done, though it may be difficult to distinguish between what minions are on the field.			"

												Disclaimer: I have 30 hours played of this game not through Steam, but I wanted to write a review since it appears to be newly added here.Rating: 6/10This game attempts to combine hearthstone and chess, and the fusion is just awkward. The developers went overboard trying to cover up how rigorously they copied the formula for Hearthstone, and ended up renaming card effects to laughably awkward names, such as renaming battlecry to ""opening gambit"". Not so ironically the only features of the game that werent directly taken from Hearthstone or Chess are the worst ones, such as the ""face forward"" feature. Essentially your characters always face the same direction from the start of the match. This was implemented so that they could add ""backstab"" and ""infiltrate"" to the game. Two crappy features that basically reward you for a positional advantage. While that might sound cool at first it basically just boils down to nerds trying to teleport behind you and get an OTK doublestrike. The clunkiness of the board makes it so that it's not rare at all to be standing back to back with the enemy general. For a few hours the game has its charms, but then becomes extremely bland. The only positive things I can say about the game are that the sprites are fantastic, and the single player challenges present some fun puzzles for a few hours of entertainment.			"

												Seems like a really good game but I can't deal with how hard the sell is. I understand they need to make money, and I intended to pick up a few packs/orbs, I did buy the full expansion set. I'm fine with selling packs, emotes, skins all that stuff, but what I can't deal with is the key system. Basically giving you half the prize is nothing but a carrot on a stick and I find it distasteful. I recently uninstalled Paragon for the exact same reason. However I feel it's worse here as my friend opened up prismatic (shiny) cards from these chests, it's not just cosmetics. Like I said though, there is a great game here. If the key thing doesn't bother you then go for it. I half wish I wasn't so put off by the practice, but for myself personally, I can not recommend a game using this system.			"

												The art direction in this game is amazing.  Combined with the music and story, it creates an immersive experience.Other than that, the gameplay itself is boring at best.  Anyone trying to compare the gameplay to Fire Emblem or Advance Wars has played neither game.  Sure, both use sprites, but the depth of strategy in both games goes much, much deeper than this game ever will.If you haven't noticed yet, all of the positive reviews have basically 100% like rates, and the negative reviews have 0% like rates.  This is a reflection of the fact that the only people who even bother playing this game anymore are the cult followers who have invested so much time into the game that if they quit then they will be forced to come to terms with how much of their time was wasted.  They carry on in delusion.As with most people, I played the game in Beta, and watched it on Twitch when it was streamed by the many Hearthstone players.  But alas, they don't play this game anymore.  Why is that?  Because the overwhelming majority of people realized that this game is boring and stopped watching.  This game is hardly streamed anymore by larger streamers because they lose viewers and therefore revenue from just playing the game.Don't let these positive reviews fool you.  The only people writing reviews are the circle jerk minions that worship the game, as you can clearly see from the like-dislike ratio I mentioned earlier.Actual chess is more fun than this game.			"

												It's really well done.The unopenable crates are annoying. But I don't win much so maybe I'm just not worthy of opening them. I really wanna see a team vs team match up version. Something like a larger arena with four players each in a corner. And maybe and 4 way every one for themselves. Like in MTG. Would be really really fun. But despite some cliches, (Having a wall chasing me, or having my enemies immovables able to gain attack but not mine. And one time an ability I used didn't work properly.) But it it loads of strategic entertainment. Also, in case you couldn't tell, I suck at making good decks. So maybe some reward decks for collecting the required cards from time to time? Ok maybe not the last part.			"

												Awesome game...This is one of the best CCG i've ever played. The faction system really forces me to think more about strategies when building ny decks.Now i've played this game for a while, i noticed that adding some features may make the game even better (and hopefully attract more fans!)Add a universal critical damage system. I know a game that uses this, and it really adds some randomness to the game. You know, randomly double the attack damage of your minions randomly, and because it's universal you would expect every minion to crit regardless of their abilities.Aside from that, i heavily recommend this game. Keep up the good work devs.			"

												There are a lot of parallels to Hearthstone, but it's a very different game.  For one, there's the obvious tactical board, which is a dramatic change.  For two, there's a lot less RNG, and what of it there is has a lot less impact on the game.  Hearthstone was made for casuals.  Duelyst was made for gamers.			"

												Very good card game. Tactical board style, unique graphics and a lot of class and gameplay variety. Unlike Hearthstone, you get card packs here very quickly, thus the making of your own style of decks doesn't require any money if you wish. With this the legendary drop rate is about 5x higher than in HS, which is a needed aspect for getting into card games in my opinion.TL;DR It's free, it's awesome, go give it a try and see it's superior to HS.

												Amazing blend of turn based strategy and card combat games.  I've actually played this game since beta, but only recently got it on Steam.  VERY viable to be a completely free player, but cash purchases are also fair yet feel quality and worthwhile.  Strategy will take you a lot further than money will, unlike similar games in the genre.  Rewards are frequent and generous, so it doesn't feel as tedius if you were to earn your way rather than purchasing.I've only gotten to high gold rank (7, you start at 30, diamond begins at 5).  I had only spent $10 by then and it was only to support the game at the moment in time, it was not at all necessary.  I don't know if you'd ever truly need to spend money to compete, but if you really needed the entire card library at your hands, chances are you're very high rank and very dedicated to the game by then and willing to spend your way.This game also has a gauntlet mode similar to HS arena where you draft a deck so there is no way to buy better odds of victory.  You earn gold much faster than other games and can regularly buy keys (keys are purchasable with both earned gold and cash).All in all this is both the best competive card game and competitive turn based strategy game on the market.In addition to the ranked pvp, there are plenty of puzzles and challenges to both practice and earn gold without the pressure of playing against other players for those who stress that.  There used to be a new puzzle challenge daily, which are temporarily suspended for developments sake but are supposed to be returning later.  There are also special pve boss battle challenges that will really test your skill and teach you to deal with ridiculous odds stacked against you.This game is also free, if you even remotely like either card or strategy games, just install it and thank me later.P.S. when you make an account, get a referral code off of a friend or your favorite streamer.  You'll get 100 bonus gold to start with and if you stick with the game and rank up you'll earn them nice bonuses too!			"

												9/10 My first impression of the game, reminds me of Magic the Gathering if it had a baby with chess. The game itself plays beautifully and all the lighting effects tie into the combat in a way that doesn't make it repetetive. I spent an hour playing this with my friend, and am definitely going to come back. Would 100% reccomend to anyone that likes competetive strategy games.			"

												I've been playing Duelyst for over a year now, and while I don't sink quite as many hours into it as I used to, it's still a really fun card game that I would definitely recommend. The pixel art is some of the best I've seen, the board mechanics bring an extra level of strategy to duels, and the card mechanics are really dynamic and fun. There are a few things about the game that are sorta unfun, like Vanar being a faction heavily based around cheap removal (or just the plethora of cheap removal in general), but otherwise there's very few gripes I have about this game. Everything in the game can be earned over time by just playing if you don't want to spend money, and high rarity drops from the core set are very high. This game definitely has a bit of a learning curve though, so if you're looking at a game to play when your brain is turned off, this might not be the one for you, but if you want an engaging and fun card and tactics game, this should be right up your alley.

												I've put nearly 200 hours into this game since I found it a couple of months ago.  It presents fascinating challenges in positional play, hand management, and deckbuilding.   There's a ton of variety - each faction plays differently, and there are enough builds and combos (even with only the basic cards) to keep you interested for a long time.  Although tactically deep, the battles are refreshingly short - lasting 10-15 minutes on average.It's also easy to get into without spending a lot of (or any) money - you can buid a strong deck with just the basic cards, and the model is generous enough that you could probably build one that's top-level within a couple of weeks.

It dosen't feel like I'm doing damage when I'm doing tons.  Even Hearthstone's plain attack animaton(if you can call that an animation) felt more juicier.+oh and just found out you can't get duplicate or something?(I mean more than 3) so maybe less money sucking than hearthstone.

												Great game. Duelyst is only two days old but I've already sunk 20 hours into it, which is not something I do often... (help). I've played a decent amount of TCGs in my lifetime aand I think the last grid-based rpg I played was FFTactics Advance on the GBA, so thats some background for relevance. Don't really like having to write out full reviews when recommending a game that I like and want to succeed, so I'll just jot down some bullet points.-6 faction decks to choose from. Each with different playstyles / approaches. So lots of card variety --currently the game boasts over 400 cards, so thats about 60 cards per faction, and a very large Nuetral card faction (cards that can augment any deck) consisting of close to 200 cards. That is a really nice start for a new game of this type.-each faction has two unique Generals (one included and one unlockable) that are available to you each with a different special ability. You start with your general on your side of the map and can move him about, summoning minions and taking actions, attacking, etc. But it also holds your HP so play accordingly.-Ranking system in place-Factions level up as you play to unlock more from their decks-card crafting-good amount of daily quests (4iirc), and the option to replace the ones you don't wish to fulfill--oh and good quest variety; deal X dmg in a game, kill X amount of creeps, etc. instead of just ""Play as X faction""			"

												Duelyst is a F2P card game mixed with turned based Strategy. It is pretty much like Hearthstone but when you play the cards they are not just cards, instead the cards are minions who you can move around in a small arena.

												This is the brain child of Mage Wars and Hearthstone getting together finally, and in no way is it a bad thing. If you have played Hearthstone at all you will instantly see the influence of the game. The booster packs cost the same, the draft mode cost the same. You get daily quest, and completing them will give you gold. The Mage Wars portion comes in the checker board combat where you and your creatures are physically represented in the world and requires a whole new layer of strategy that Hearthstone does not offer, given that you can move your avatar in and out of combat, block off impending attacks with a wall of your own creatures, and need to be aware of what's on the field, what can potentially make it to you, and where you may need to go. How does it go for someone who doesn't pay? I don't pay, I ranked up to 18 in the Silver league last night. While not super impressive, I haven't spent a dollar on the game. Simply grinding out gold on the Solo quests offered, which provide you a scenario and challenge you to kill the opponent in one turn ala Magic the Gatherings video game iterations, and from doing the daily quests that I was offered. The booster packs have been more than enough to supplement my deck nicely and I find the game quite enjoyable. The long term con I can see to this game is of course, what else can they do with it? The draft mode is fun, but I'm not going to pay for gold, which means I can only draft when I grind out the required 150. Hearthstone got to the point where I was only logging on to play the Brawl mode because they were fun and offered unique games that were quite memorable. Once you complete the Solo portion, which I haven't yet, where does it go from there? Will you continully have to beat your head against ladder play, hoping to slowly grind out gold till you can buy your next booster pack? If so I could very easily see a lull coming in the game for my future. Despite these reservations, I have still enjoyed the game, for the little time that I've been playing.All in all, this is a fantastic game, that requires a both a head for strategy, deck building, and card playing. My only concern, where does it go from here? "

												I have enjoyed this game very much so far. The pixel art is absolutley amazing and the animation is very fluid. The game is similar to hearthstone and magic this is actually a good point. Meaning the game is easy to pick up. There is also a mechanic which enables the player to replace a card in your hand with another random card in your deck, this helps combat the RNG mechanics of virtually every card game. Also the blend of cards and a board is very well done in this game. Finally card packs are easy to gather through minor play time. P2W aspects are still there but someone who hasent payed a dollar can easily compete with someone who has. For a free game it is amazing and gives you that satisfying feeling when you outsmart your opponent and snag the win. 9/10 would play again.			"

												Duelyst is a game I have spent all day playing and I have reached ladder level 20. It reminds me of Fire Emblem (probably because I've played it recently and I'm thinking of units as such with the strategic field) and Magic The Gathering with the effects of the units and such and how complex each move can be when you make it; whether you flourish throuh your enemy or you get dragged across the battlefield by your legs each move matters and you cannot unmake that move once it's made.I played one match of The Gauntlet and I loved the drafting bit very much, I'm just sad I couldn't win one match :pWhen a game can make me shake in tension and anticipation of what moves to make so I don't mess up. It's a good game.Duelyst is definitely one of the games I will support, it does what it does very well. From getting gold from playing ladder matches, to the card breadh that can be used for play, it's all in the cards <3Go ahead and give it a try!			"

												My credentials:-Made it into S-rank, the top tier on the ladder.-12 win run in Gauntlet (the max).-Been playing about 8 months-Spent about $50 on the game.So what is Duelyst? Duelyst is a free-to-play CCG that uses a 5x9 board top play cards on. Each player has a general with 25HP and 2 ATK. Each unit can move 2 squares, and then attack (this includes generals, as they are units too). Each general belongs to a faction and has a unique ""Bloodborne Spell"", which refreshes at set intervals and doesn't cost a card. Your deck will consist of cards that are exclusive to your faction and the ""Neutral"" cards, which everyone can run. To get cards, you buy ""Orbs"" (aka packs of cards) with gold, the ingame currency. The resource system consists of a mana pool that grows each turn, and tiles on the board that act as ""get +1 mana this turn"" if you have a friendly unit walk over them. You draw one card each turn, and have the option to replace one card you dont want from your hand each turn, and you are guaranteed to not get the same card back.Why do I mention the replace mechanic specifically? Because the replace mechanic, along with the board, really set Duelyst apart from other CCGs. Since card games rely on Random Number Generators (or RNG) to create variance and make games play out differently, there will be times that you flat out lose due to simple chance. That is the nature of RNG. Duelyst's replace mechanic helps to minimize this as much as possible- if a card doesn't help you, throw it away and get a new one! Top-decking is less frustrating just because of that feature.As for the gameplay, it's awesome.-Games are relatively fast-paced-Every faction is viable at the highest levels (some generals are not as much, but you get the choice of 2 generals per faction)-Several different viable deck types-New players can, with enough skill, make it surprisingly high on the ladder without any investment.-Three copies of any given card, combined with a deck size of 40 and the replace mechanic, make decks consistent enough to feel like you can find the cards you need when you need them.-Daily challenges force you to think about unit interactions, and reward you for completing them.-Gauntlet allows you to draft a deck by choosing 1 of three randomly chosen cards of a given rarity, 30 times. You play until you either get 12 wins (the max) or 3 losses. You only need 7 wins to get a ticket for a free Gauntlet run, so going infinite is fairly easy once you have experience.However, not every game is perfect.-Devs have not been as transparent as they should have been. The past few updates have had changes that negatively impacted players gold income as well as nerfed rarity rates in the expansion orbs.-Newly added cards are ""raising the bar"" and causing some power creep. When playing against optimized decks in higher ranks, you can find yourself in ""Answer this or die"" situations several turns in a row.-Cosmetics are fairly expensive in real-world currency. Thankfully, they are ONLY cosmetic and do not affect the game. On top of that, you can craft the cosmetics you want by destroying cards you don't want for in-game currency.-Game is laggy on old rigs. Even some newer rigs can struggle at times.-Managing decklists is painful. There is no officially supported API, and no official way to import/export decklists. One player has created scripts to do this, but this should be officially supported and not require the community to fix.Overall, there is too much to say in one post. The game is great and well worth giving a try. For a short time, Humble Bundle is giving out free codes to brand new players for 20 free orbs and a free legendary. So there's no better time than now to give it a shot. There are some things that need to be addressed, but few games are perfect. This one comes pretty close to it though.Overall: 9/10			"

												Great game. Duelyst is only two days old but I've already sunk 20 hours into it, which is not something I do often... (help). I've played a decent amount of TCGs in my lifetime aand I think the last grid-based rpg I played was FFTactics Advance on the GBA, so thats some background for relevance. Don't really like having to write out full reviews when recommending a game that I like and want to succeed, so I'll just jot down some bullet points.-6 faction decks to choose from. Each with different playstyles / approaches. So lots of card variety --currently the game boasts over 400 cards, so thats about 60 cards per faction, and a very large Nuetral card faction (cards that can augment any deck) consisting of close to 200 cards. That is a really nice start for a new game of this type.-each faction has two unique Generals (one included and one unlockable) that are available to you each with a different special ability. You start with your general on your side of the map and can move him about, summoning minions and taking actions, attacking, etc. But it also holds your HP so play accordingly.-Ranking system in place-Factions level up as you play to unlock more from their decks-card crafting-good amount of daily quests (4iirc), and the option to replace the ones you don't wish to fulfill--oh and good quest variety; deal X dmg in a game, kill X amount of creeps, etc. instead of just ""Play as X faction""			"

												Perhaps the most important thing to say about Duelyst is that it is NOT just a card game.Duelyst does something that very few other games do with the CCG genre: it mixes it with other genres. It takes as a base the core mechanics of card games such as Hearthstone, but combines them with that of Turn-Based Strategy; in the end, it plays as a hybrid of a game like Hearthstone and Fire Emblem.It is also a consistent card game. Each deck has 40 cards, but every single turn you can choose to replace one card in your hand, challenging you to more accurately know your deck and what could be useful in the situation you are in. It also helps to reduce the chances of not being able to play something, such as mulliganing high-cost cards in Hearthstone or being manastarved/manaflooded in Magic: The Gathering. Random effects are few and far between, with most of them being very predictable.Due to the nature of the playing field and how minions and your General move, the game also has open to it many unique keywords as well as more impactful iterations of keywords devised in other games - many of which place great importance on proper positioning. For example, there is Frenzy, which causes a minion to deal its damage to all enemies around it when it attacks - alongside Provoke (All enemy minions around this cannot move or attack anything but this minion) it is perfect for punishing your opponent when he bunches up his minions. There are also keywords that offer greater mobility - such as Airdrop, which allows you to summon a minion anywhere on the map, or Flying, which lets a minion move anywhere before attacking - as well as ones that have no real analogues to other card games, like the faction-specific Zeal (The minion gains a special effect, such as +2 attack or self-healing, when it is next to your General) or Backstab (Deals extra damage equal to the backstab number and takes no counterattack damage - but only if it attacks from behind).Duelyst is also surprisingly easy to play on a budget; it is entirely possible (and surprisingly common) to be able to get past Silver division (Ranks 20-10) using only what you first start the game with, though once in Gold (Ranks 10-5), most players begin to grind to a halt. This is because, in Duelyst, you may have 3 copies of any one card in your deck - including legendary spells, artifacts and minions. This is balanced out by the fact that Legendaries are only worth 900 Spirit (Think Dust from Hearthstone), which is a paltry sum compared to those of other card games. Regardless, once in Gold and beyond, it becomes incredibly hard to progress without certain Epics and Legendaries; how many will be required depends on your own skill as well as the faction you play as. Thankfully, however, the game is very generous with the in-game currency, and as such, by the time you get to Gold, you should have enough of a card collection to be able to adjust your deck to survive in higher ranks.All in all, Duelyst is a card game that is more than a card game and hinges greatly on one's skill in positioning and knowledge of what your enemy can bring to the field, rather than luck. It has a kind community, diligent developers and great skill ceiling. If you enjoy card games such as Hearthstone, but end up frustrated with them due to their lack of depth and poor game balance, I would suggest trying Duelyst.Oh yeah, and if you didn't look at the images and videos of it, the art and animations are gorgeous and the soundtrack is really good.

												I have enjoyed this game very much so far. The pixel art is absolutley amazing and the animation is very fluid. The game is similar to hearthstone and magic this is actually a good point. Meaning the game is easy to pick up. There is also a mechanic which enables the player to replace a card in your hand with another random card in your deck, this helps combat the RNG mechanics of virtually every card game. Also the blend of cards and a board is very well done in this game. Finally card packs are easy to gather through minor play time. P2W aspects are still there but someone who hasent payed a dollar can easily compete with someone who has. For a free game it is amazing and gives you that satisfying feeling when you outsmart your opponent and snag the win. 9/10 would play again.			"

												                       Duelyst is a digital CCG with more tiny, important decisions than any card game I’ve played before. Matches play out on a five-by-nine board that starts with just you and your opponent’s general. Each general has 2 attack, 25 health, and a unique Bloodborn Spell. Like most other CCGs that take their inspiration from Magic: The Gathering, you draw cards from a custom built deck, play spells, and summon minions until you’ve killed the opposing general.                         The bones of the game feel comfortable and familiar, but adding a board and movement makes a staggering difference. Because you can only summon minions in squares adjacent to friendly units, and most units only move two squares per turn, small choices on the first turn of the game—where to step or where to summon—will affect turns all the way to the end of the match.                          Simple to get into for both Veteran and new players, Personaly I've recomended this game to seasonal hearthstone players and friends alike. A whole lot of fun.-10/10 TheRealMuertitos			"

												Duelyst is a free-to-play collectible card game and turn-based strategy hybrid developed by Counterplay games. Pros:1) Nicely done pixel art, animations are fluid2) Tactical gameplay makes minion positioning just as important as what card to play.3) Generous giving of Epics and Legendaries. You can open 1 legendary in 2 packs in a row even if you just open 1 pack per day. Allows for lots of Spirit for crafting the better cards. 4) Quest allow even beginning players to get gold just by playing and not requiring you to always win. Gold is gained faster if you win of course. 5) Has decent Basic removal, dispel and displacement cards for the neutral and Faction set meaning even if your opponent has a better card you can still have some chance to save yourself. 6) 6 Factions each with a unique playstyle and mechanics. Each faction has a General with an ability called a bloodborn spell that that has a 2 turn cooldown after use until the late game where its reduced to every turn. Each faction has 2 general each with their own bloodborn spell allowing for a preferred playstyle.7) All consmetics can be crafted from spirit. Cons: 1) Lack of a casual mode means that you can only play ladder which can be bad after a certain point for new players as you can get matched up with more experianced players who have more effective and synergistic cards. 2) Keys for Crates can only be bought with real money luckily these contain mostly cosmetics that you can craft with Spirit. Conclusion: Duelyst is a free to play tactical turn based collecting card game with lots of depth and strategy. A decent chance to get higher rarity cards such as legendaries (around every 4 packs or so from the core set and every 6 packs from the expansion) allow even one pack opening per day to yield a decent collection after about 2 wks to a month. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a different take in the CCG genre.			"

												RARE CARD HANDOUTS LESS DISHEARTENING THAN HEARSTONE (SEE WHAT I DID THERE)This game is great. The freemium model does not hold you back much since ""Gauntlet"" mode involves building random decks and rarer cards seem to be handed out more frequently. I really did  try with Hearstone but got 1 legendary in.... more hours than I have put into this game so far.Also the whole board thing is super and gives you a bit more feeling of control over the outcome of battles (as opposed to pure-card games where some legendary card can just gaurantee your loss).Anyway - great game - great job developers!

												My credentials:-Made it into S-rank, the top tier on the ladder.-12 win run in Gauntlet (the max).-Been playing about 8 months-Spent about $50 on the game.So what is Duelyst? Duelyst is a free-to-play CCG that uses a 5x9 board top play cards on. Each player has a general with 25HP and 2 ATK. Each unit can move 2 squares, and then attack (this includes generals, as they are units too). Each general belongs to a faction and has a unique ""Bloodborne Spell"", which refreshes at set intervals and doesn't cost a card. Your deck will consist of cards that are exclusive to your faction and the ""Neutral"" cards, which everyone can run. To get cards, you buy ""Orbs"" (aka packs of cards) with gold, the ingame currency. The resource system consists of a mana pool that grows each turn, and tiles on the board that act as ""get +1 mana this turn"" if you have a friendly unit walk over them. You draw one card each turn, and have the option to replace one card you dont want from your hand each turn, and you are guaranteed to not get the same card back.Why do I mention the replace mechanic specifically? Because the replace mechanic, along with the board, really set Duelyst apart from other CCGs. Since card games rely on Random Number Generators (or RNG) to create variance and make games play out differently, there will be times that you flat out lose due to simple chance. That is the nature of RNG. Duelyst's replace mechanic helps to minimize this as much as possible- if a card doesn't help you, throw it away and get a new one! Top-decking is less frustrating just because of that feature.As for the gameplay, it's awesome.-Games are relatively fast-paced-Every faction is viable at the highest levels (some generals are not as much, but you get the choice of 2 generals per faction)-Several different viable deck types-New players can, with enough skill, make it surprisingly high on the ladder without any investment.-Three copies of any given card, combined with a deck size of 40 and the replace mechanic, make decks consistent enough to feel like you can find the cards you need when you need them.-Daily challenges force you to think about unit interactions, and reward you for completing them.-Gauntlet allows you to draft a deck by choosing 1 of three randomly chosen cards of a given rarity, 30 times. You play until you either get 12 wins (the max) or 3 losses. You only need 7 wins to get a ticket for a free Gauntlet run, so going infinite is fairly easy once you have experience.However, not every game is perfect.-Devs have not been as transparent as they should have been. The past few updates have had changes that negatively impacted players gold income as well as nerfed rarity rates in the expansion orbs.-Newly added cards are ""raising the bar"" and causing some power creep. When playing against optimized decks in higher ranks, you can find yourself in ""Answer this or die"" situations several turns in a row.-Cosmetics are fairly expensive in real-world currency. Thankfully, they are ONLY cosmetic and do not affect the game. On top of that, you can craft the cosmetics you want by destroying cards you don't want for in-game currency.-Game is laggy on old rigs. Even some newer rigs can struggle at times.-Managing decklists is painful. There is no officially supported API, and no official way to import/export decklists. One player has created scripts to do this, but this should be officially supported and not require the community to fix.Overall, there is too much to say in one post. The game is great and well worth giving a try. For a short time, Humble Bundle is giving out free codes to brand new players for 20 free orbs and a free legendary. So there's no better time than now to give it a shot. There are some things that need to be addressed, but few games are perfect. This one comes pretty close to it though.Overall: 9/10			"

												Duelyst is a game I have spent all day playing and I have reached ladder level 20. It reminds me of Fire Emblem (probably because I've played it recently and I'm thinking of units as such with the strategic field) and Magic The Gathering with the effects of the units and such and how complex each move can be when you make it; whether you flourish throuh your enemy or you get dragged across the battlefield by your legs each move matters and you cannot unmake that move once it's made.I played one match of The Gauntlet and I loved the drafting bit very much, I'm just sad I couldn't win one match :pWhen a game can make me shake in tension and anticipation of what moves to make so I don't mess up. It's a good game.Duelyst is definitely one of the games I will support, it does what it does very well. From getting gold from playing ladder matches, to the card breadh that can be used for play, it's all in the cards <3Go ahead and give it a try!			"

												This is my favorite strategy game for a good few years, probably a decade. It's also the best DTCG i've ever played, and i've played nearly all of them. I played paper MTG from Ice Age til about 2010, and played MTGO, hearthstone, Infinity Wars, Scrolls, and more others than I can remember. I've also played lots of 4X, and as many tactical RPG's as I could find.NOTHING, repeat NOTHING has ever came close to scratching the itch of deck building AND grid based tactcs as this game.This game, so rich, such depth of tactical aproaches. Yes there's a meta, but there is a constant stream of new cards, not to mention expansions, and there are so many cards and factions that you can quite easily construct your own viable decklists and concepts, even based around strange concepts. The game in play is a lot like a game of chess, albeit one with 900 possible pieces. Order of play, piece / card placement is paramount, and you can, once get good at the game, go toe to toe with most decks.This is a keeper.			"

A CCG with a board, where positioning is one of the most important aspects of the match (unless you're ♥♥♥♥ing Songhai). It is free with options to acquire Spirit Orbs (boosters) for real money, but totally fair for players that don't want to spend any money. The crafting system is really fair, and there is a bunch of powerful cards of common rarity.The monthly season system is very fair and it gives rewards in the form of new cards at the end of it, the rewards is based on your highest position in the month (also you cannot drop Divisions, like S Rank, Platinum, Gold and Silver) once you obtained it. Two monthly patches as well!The pixel art seems to be a hit or miss, some people hate it, and some people love it (I find it astonishing well made)			"

And beautifications can also be bought without real money.			"

												Seriously, much effort was put into the game and yet its still not getting the amount of love it deserves.What impressed me in Duelyst:Its Hearthstone -aka every TCG nowadays- but with more tactics/mechanics to work with (i.e. positioning units matters on the battlefield).-Beautiful and smoothly animated pixel sprites. but its safe to say EVERYTHING IN THE GAME IS CANDY FOR THE EYES.-Music is super epic and above my expected standar.-Lore, lots of it is in the form of a history/timeline of the world (OMG ITS WITH AUDIO NARRATION EVEN).Remeber, ALL that for 0.00 of whatever currency your region charges.

												Fantastic game. Basically chess where everyone (collects and) chooses a custom set of pieces. Faster than chess though and with much more variety.I've been quite obsessed with this game. Pro and cons:+ Matches are challenging; a lot of tactical considerations need to be made constantly. A replay function helps to review and learn from mistakes.+ Six factions with many many possible styles and archetypes to play.+ Little randomness.+ Deck building is challenging and fun, can also be skipped by simply copying a deck from the internet.+ Very fair free-to-play model (to be honest I actually invested money. 10$). You can get quite far without investing any money. By doing quests you can get about one card pack each day with good drop rates of rare cards.+ Very helpful community, close to zero abusive behavior.+ The match-making system works very well, matches are found quickly.+ Well-done tutorial.+ Gorgeous pixel art and sound/music.+ The developers maintain the game actively and listen to community feedback.+ For parents: can be played with only one hand (touchpad or mouse). Being away from keyboard for a minute if real-life calls is usually ok. Matches are usually fast (5-10min).+ Good interface in-match.- Very little single-player content.- Quite demanding for a pixel art game (<30 FPS on my laptop with Intel HD Graphics first generation, but doing fine on later generations), however for most people that won't be an issue I guess.- Awkward interface in deck building / card pool management.- Very little statistics, but there are some community mods for that.For veterans from Magic the Gathering:+ Forget all problems involving mana. Here you get mana for free; each round your pool increases. One less random factor to care about, but definitely doesn't make the game trivial as there are ways to manipulate the mana curve.+ Much less worrying about picking a good hand, because you get to mulligan two cards at the beginning (while seeing who your opponent will be, allowing strategic decisions already), and you can replace a card for free every turn (guaranteed not drawing the same card)!+ There's a proper board which leads to more tactical depth.+ A match is quickly found.- Obviously not as many cards as MtG, but that's the same for most CCGs out there.Lastly, especially if this guide helped you, you may use zypsilon as a referral code and we both profit!

												I won't beat around the bush here: Duelyst is Hearthstone with a board. But the addition of the board makes such a difference. The element of positioning is so important that the skill ceiling is raised, and it is possible to play with a weaker deck than your opponent and out-play them on the board.The monthly balance changes are great for mixing up the meta too. Sure, you get a bunch of whining on the forums but I've been very happy with how they're approaching it.			"

												I routinely play this game.  I'm playing the game as I write this review.    It's awesome.  All the packs.  I'm an RNG junkie.  I play every day for the packs.  The pixel art is nice too. They update the game twice a month with new features, bug fixes and usually four new cards.  Sets come every one in a while.  Rewards pop up way more frequently than hearthstone.  Wait times for games are about 10 seconds.  The game is a turn based strategy board game.  You move your cards on 9 x 5 board and try to kill the guys 25 life.  Pretty standard fare.  There's a tutorial at the beginning of the game.  The game is fun.  I've been playing for around six months though the steam numbers may say otherwise.			"

												If you played Yu-Gi Oh! when you were a kid you're going to love this game.The game is simple at the beginning but once you obtained the basics of the game you'll realize the huge amount of content the game could offer.I love the pixelized graphics of the minions and spells and also the generals.Though I would say something about the buying of card packs in the game. It makes me feel that the game is a pay-to-win game though not that strictly because sometimes you earn gold that you can use to buy card packs without spending any money.I used to play League of Legends and because of it I had anxiety playing ranked games. I wish this game would put more content on players who prefer to play the game alone, just collecting stuffs and playing with bots and friends.Overall the game is really really good and well thought of. It's one of those games that you wished you created because it's so good. So yeah I recommend it.			"

It is like a combination of Hearthstone and Final Fantasy Tactics/Fire Emblem.The gameplay is great, the art is great, the music is great, everything is pretty great. My only complaint is that gold earnings are now a bit less than when I first started about a year ago, but it is still generous.I would recommend this game since it is free. If you plan to play completely free without buying any cards, then you will have a long grind, unfortunately, unless you stick to one faction and disenchant all cards from the others.			"

												Not sure why this game is getting so many bad reviews. At low levels, you can easily progress using basic (free) cards, and you can get a decent way into the higher ranks having crafted a few staple common (cheap) cards. The grinding in this game is considerably less than in literally any other F2P game I've played in the last two years.Regular updates. Complex, satisfying gameplay. True, some factions are currently more prevalent than others, but CPG actively balances the most powerful cards to make sure that the meta doesn't stay fixed from month to month. Crazy weird synergies can be found anywhere.Example: let's take the powerful dinosaur man faction, throw in spell cards which deal damage to summon minions at lower cost, then include minions which spawn other minions/deal AOE damage/deal damage directly to their General/etc, and we have one crazily powerful deck with 100% more green lizard men./r/duelyst is a great place to go for links to all the guides, starting out tips, FAQs and miscellaneous chat about the game. Give the game a try and have fun!			"

												I have tried many, but this is likely the best collectible card game around. If you want a CCG which requires skill and with a limited luck factor, this is your best choice. Despite the high skill cap, the game is also very easy to catch up, since the rules and the interactions are ultimately very simple. If you ever played Hearthstone, you should understand immediately how Duelyst works, but you will be surprised by its depth.			"

												It is very similar to Hearthstone and yet the differencies are enough to take it as a whole new game. The chess board you play on brings a new level of depth with new or modified card effects adapted to make you care about positionning. You can also add the fact that : - you can replace one card of your hand per turn,- your hero can trade every turn and strike back every time a minion attacks him,- his hero power (called BBS here) is a very strong but limited ressource at first,- the RNG part of the game is very minor compared to HSAll these differences change considerably the dynamic of the game and I would say the game has a very high skillcap.Its community is also growing regularly and I would say the game is more beginner-friendly than HS with all the challenges created to teach you the basics. I have to add that, while the decks can hold 3 of the same legendary, the drop rate of rare+ cards in each pack in way higher than it is in HS so you'll have no problem building good decks.			"

												i've tried pretty much all the F2P collectible card games on steam, (and blizzard's hearthstone) and duelyst by far is the only one i play.the other CCGs didn't capture me for either of these reasons: -very high skill ceiling, too much of a grind to get cards, not enough players, too generic, p2w, too much RNG involved. but lets talk about duelyst.-6 factions, each faction has 2 different 'general's, or heros.  so you choose a faction, then 1 of the 2 general, then build up your deck with a mix of faction specific cards and neutral cards.  nothing really different from other CCGs except that it is played on a grid.  go see a youtube vid on the gameplay; easier to see it in motion.  -very generous in gaining ingame currency to be able to get more cards.  i never felt i had to use real money since the daily quests give you lots of ingame currency, especially if you compare them to other CCGs-most of the legendary cards are either very situational, or they only really fit into a particular faction's synergy.  so don't be thinking that just because you are a new player and lack legendary cards, that you are fighting an uphill battle.  -you are ranked (obviously), and majority of time only play within your ranking, from lowest to highest is bronze, silver, gold, diamond, and finally S-rank.   season restarts every month.  depending on the high rank you achieved, you will get a reward based on it.  once you reach a new rank, you can't go down to the lower rank.  your rank is account based; not faction based.   along with the generous ingame currency rewards, i feel like the difficulty, or skill ceiling is just right, at least for me.  not so complex that it turns me off, but also not so casually easy and RNG based. no matter the time of day/night, you will wait no longer than 30 seconds to get a match.  the playerbase is small , but its solid.  the average waiting time for me is 10 seconds.  of course it can be frustrating reach a new rank and then just lose after lose.  but the official dueylst forum is filled w/helpful people, and the devs do chat on the forums.   its F2P, and i believe it will be coming on mobile, xbox 1, and PS4 in the near future.

												I have enjoyed this game very much so far. The pixel art is absolutley amazing and the animation is very fluid. The game is similar to hearthstone and magic this is actually a good point. Meaning the game is easy to pick up. There is also a mechanic which enables the player to replace a card in your hand with another random card in your deck, this helps combat the RNG mechanics of virtually every card game. Also the blend of cards and a board is very well done in this game. Finally card packs are easy to gather through minor play time. P2W aspects are still there but someone who hasent payed a dollar can easily compete with someone who has. For a free game it is amazing and gives you that satisfying feeling when you outsmart your opponent and snag the win. 9/10 would play again.			"

												Duelyst is a game I have spent all day playing and I have reached ladder level 20. It reminds me of Fire Emblem (probably because I've played it recently and I'm thinking of units as such with the strategic field) and Magic The Gathering with the effects of the units and such and how complex each move can be when you make it; whether you flourish throuh your enemy or you get dragged across the battlefield by your legs each move matters and you cannot unmake that move once it's made.I played one match of The Gauntlet and I loved the drafting bit very much, I'm just sad I couldn't win one match :pWhen a game can make me shake in tension and anticipation of what moves to make so I don't mess up. It's a good game.Duelyst is definitely one of the games I will support, it does what it does very well. From getting gold from playing ladder matches, to the card breadh that can be used for play, it's all in the cards <3Go ahead and give it a try!			"

												My credentials:-Made it into S-rank, the top tier on the ladder.-12 win run in Gauntlet (the max).-Been playing about 8 months-Spent about $50 on the game.So what is Duelyst? Duelyst is a free-to-play CCG that uses a 5x9 board top play cards on. Each player has a general with 25HP and 2 ATK. Each unit can move 2 squares, and then attack (this includes generals, as they are units too). Each general belongs to a faction and has a unique ""Bloodborne Spell"", which refreshes at set intervals and doesn't cost a card. Your deck will consist of cards that are exclusive to your faction and the ""Neutral"" cards, which everyone can run. To get cards, you buy ""Orbs"" (aka packs of cards) with gold, the ingame currency. The resource system consists of a mana pool that grows each turn, and tiles on the board that act as ""get +1 mana this turn"" if you have a friendly unit walk over them. You draw one card each turn, and have the option to replace one card you dont want from your hand each turn, and you are guaranteed to not get the same card back.Why do I mention the replace mechanic specifically? Because the replace mechanic, along with the board, really set Duelyst apart from other CCGs. Since card games rely on Random Number Generators (or RNG) to create variance and make games play out differently, there will be times that you flat out lose due to simple chance. That is the nature of RNG. Duelyst's replace mechanic helps to minimize this as much as possible- if a card doesn't help you, throw it away and get a new one! Top-decking is less frustrating just because of that feature.As for the gameplay, it's awesome.-Games are relatively fast-paced-Every faction is viable at the highest levels (some generals are not as much, but you get the choice of 2 generals per faction)-Several different viable deck types-New players can, with enough skill, make it surprisingly high on the ladder without any investment.-Three copies of any given card, combined with a deck size of 40 and the replace mechanic, make decks consistent enough to feel like you can find the cards you need when you need them.-Daily challenges force you to think about unit interactions, and reward you for completing them.-Gauntlet allows you to draft a deck by choosing 1 of three randomly chosen cards of a given rarity, 30 times. You play until you either get 12 wins (the max) or 3 losses. You only need 7 wins to get a ticket for a free Gauntlet run, so going infinite is fairly easy once you have experience.However, not every game is perfect.-Devs have not been as transparent as they should have been. The past few updates have had changes that negatively impacted players gold income as well as nerfed rarity rates in the expansion orbs.-Newly added cards are ""raising the bar"" and causing some power creep. When playing against optimized decks in higher ranks, you can find yourself in ""Answer this or die"" situations several turns in a row.-Cosmetics are fairly expensive in real-world currency. Thankfully, they are ONLY cosmetic and do not affect the game. On top of that, you can craft the cosmetics you want by destroying cards you don't want for in-game currency.-Game is laggy on old rigs. Even some newer rigs can struggle at times.-Managing decklists is painful. There is no officially supported API, and no official way to import/export decklists. One player has created scripts to do this, but this should be officially supported and not require the community to fix.Overall, there is too much to say in one post. The game is great and well worth giving a try. For a short time, Humble Bundle is giving out free codes to brand new players for 20 free orbs and a free legendary. So there's no better time than now to give it a shot. There are some things that need to be addressed, but few games are perfect. This one comes pretty close to it though.Overall: 9/10			"

												Perhaps the most important thing to say about Duelyst is that it is NOT just a card game.Duelyst does something that very few other games do with the CCG genre: it mixes it with other genres. It takes as a base the core mechanics of card games such as Hearthstone, but combines them with that of Turn-Based Strategy; in the end, it plays as a hybrid of a game like Hearthstone and Fire Emblem.It is also a consistent card game. Each deck has 40 cards, but every single turn you can choose to replace one card in your hand, challenging you to more accurately know your deck and what could be useful in the situation you are in. It also helps to reduce the chances of not being able to play something, such as mulliganing high-cost cards in Hearthstone or being manastarved/manaflooded in Magic: The Gathering. Random effects are few and far between, with most of them being very predictable.Due to the nature of the playing field and how minions and your General move, the game also has open to it many unique keywords as well as more impactful iterations of keywords devised in other games - many of which place great importance on proper positioning. For example, there is Frenzy, which causes a minion to deal its damage to all enemies around it when it attacks - alongside Provoke (All enemy minions around this cannot move or attack anything but this minion) it is perfect for punishing your opponent when he bunches up his minions. There are also keywords that offer greater mobility - such as Airdrop, which allows you to summon a minion anywhere on the map, or Flying, which lets a minion move anywhere before attacking - as well as ones that have no real analogues to other card games, like the faction-specific Zeal (The minion gains a special effect, such as +2 attack or self-healing, when it is next to your General) or Backstab (Deals extra damage equal to the backstab number and takes no counterattack damage - but only if it attacks from behind).Duelyst is also surprisingly easy to play on a budget; it is entirely possible (and surprisingly common) to be able to get past Silver division (Ranks 20-10) using only what you first start the game with, though once in Gold (Ranks 10-5), most players begin to grind to a halt. This is because, in Duelyst, you may have 3 copies of any one card in your deck - including legendary spells, artifacts and minions. This is balanced out by the fact that Legendaries are only worth 900 Spirit (Think Dust from Hearthstone), which is a paltry sum compared to those of other card games. Regardless, once in Gold and beyond, it becomes incredibly hard to progress without certain Epics and Legendaries; how many will be required depends on your own skill as well as the faction you play as. Thankfully, however, the game is very generous with the in-game currency, and as such, by the time you get to Gold, you should have enough of a card collection to be able to adjust your deck to survive in higher ranks.All in all, Duelyst is a card game that is more than a card game and hinges greatly on one's skill in positioning and knowledge of what your enemy can bring to the field, rather than luck. It has a kind community, diligent developers and great skill ceiling. If you enjoy card games such as Hearthstone, but end up frustrated with them due to their lack of depth and poor game balance, I would suggest trying Duelyst.Oh yeah, and if you didn't look at the images and videos of it, the art and animations are gorgeous and the soundtrack is really good.

												I'm just saying again, as others have said, that there is a solid amount of potential here in its presentation and gameplay, but the price of the paid content is just too high.  On the plus side, the sprite art is impressive, the combination of card game and strategy RPG mechanics is deep and engaging, there is a great amount of variety in the factions and units available, and the length of each match is just right.  But if the paid content remains so expensive, I just foresee the game becoming either too expensive to support itself on the income it makes from the paying community or becoming truly pay to win in order to provide incentives for more people to pay that price.  Neither option is particularly appealing.  That said, I do still recommend people at least try it because the game itself may be worth that price to some.			"

												Not sure why this game is getting so many bad reviews. At low levels, you can easily progress using basic (free) cards, and you can get a decent way into the higher ranks having crafted a few staple common (cheap) cards. The grinding in this game is considerably less than in literally any other F2P game I've played in the last two years.Regular updates. Complex, satisfying gameplay. True, some factions are currently more prevalent than others, but CPG actively balances the most powerful cards to make sure that the meta doesn't stay fixed from month to month. Crazy weird synergies can be found anywhere.Example: let's take the powerful dinosaur man faction, throw in spell cards which deal damage to summon minions at lower cost, then include minions which spawn other minions/deal AOE damage/deal damage directly to their General/etc, and we have one crazily powerful deck with 100% more green lizard men./r/duelyst is a great place to go for links to all the guides, starting out tips, FAQs and miscellaneous chat about the game. Give the game a try and have fun!			"

												Duelyst is a F2P strategy card game. It is one that is easy to learn, but hard to master. Imagine Hearthstone but the ""board"" is instead a large grid. Each players general starts with 2 attack and 25 health. First player to get the enemy general down to 0 health wins.Things get interesting however when players can summon minions to fight alongside them and each general can use spells. Duelyst covers nearly every playstyle including aggressive players who like running up and smashing their enemies (Magmar), players who want to zerg rush their enemy (Abyssian), players who excel at playing tactically and focusing on positioning (Songhai) and much more.It's not very p2w, as powerful legendary cards often are not a requirement until you get into the very top of the playerbase and many players have gotten to the top ranks using only basic cards/decks.It's a great game any card game/strategy fan should give a try.

												If you enjoy SRPGs or other Tactical turn-based games like X-Com and used to play Magic: the Gathering or enjoy Hearthstone you should really give Duelyst a shot.  Factions play out somewhat uniquely like the colors of Magic and your creature cards are actually played on a grid and can move and be deployed defensively.  Ranged creatures can actually try to stay physically distant from melee creatures. Good deck-building is rewarded but the game can be played rather casually as well.			"

												So take Hearthstone, and give it a tactical layer. That's basically Duelyst, where positioning is king alongside good cardplay and overall strategy. Add top notch pixel-art animations and overall art direction, this is a game I have unhesitantly paid money towards - and will when budget allows and they continue to keep my goodwill. With 5 factions to choose from and 2 Generals each with their own abilities, there are plenty of niches to play Duelyst with.It also helps there's less RNG apart from your card draw, and even that is ameliorated by the fact you can Replace - basically cyce one card out back into your deck for another, which helps when you have a bad draw. RNG is predominantly in random summoning placement which can make or make some plays, as well as some Mythic/Legendaries with unique abilities.Their microtransaction model is again like Hearthstone, buying packs and cosmetics with real money or earned ""Spirit"". While this game is not as generous as Eternal which has AI grinding to help you build your deck up, it makes sense not to do that since the current card pool is quite small, though as of writing we are a week away from another expansion.Overall, I strongly recommend Duelyst, with its slick presentation and very solid mechanics, makes for very compelling games.

												Wow, where to start with this game. First off it's one of the best strategy collectible card games I've played in the last couple of years, and I've done my duty to properly vet all the ones that come out. As an ex PoxNora player I was particularly attracted to the use of a board and the skill that goes into any game using those features, on top of that the game is very fast paced, with my quickest match ending in a win within three minutes and my longest being only ten minutes long!Like any collectible card game you may get the thought that it is very ""pay to win"" at first, I sure did when I watched a couple S-Rank matches and saw the use of legendary/epic rarity cards to be extremely heavy. But the use of the crafting system quickly allowed me to almost mimic some of the top tier decks I observed within TWO days of playing, by disenchanting legendary cards I got from factions I didn't play I was quickly able to obtain rare and legendary cards that directly aided in my main decks win condition.After playing for only two days (6 hours) I have come to the conclusion this is the game I've been waiting for. Heck sometimes I can manage to pull off a win using only faction leveling cards (free cards given just for practicing and leveling a faction before jumping into ranked) and common cards, this is very rare in any card game nowadays, just because I use strategy and unit placement that the use of a board gives.If you've been waiting for a gem of a collectible card game that can be more fun than even Hearthstone, MTG, or Shadowverse. Hit the download button NOW!			"

												Although im not card games aficionado, i did test couple of card games, and none of those games managed to impress me as this one.This game is played in an unique way, actually, it isnt just a card game, your cards are monsters which you move around the 9x5 chessboard map. This being said, this game can be considered as a turn based strategy and card game mix. Goal of the game is to kill the general, which acts as a main monster of each player in the game. It has very nice clean and smooth pixel art style which really stands out, and talking about complexity of the game, you can do some card combos even, but its nothing too complex so even new players can get into it easily. Currently there are 6 different factions and around 100 different cards. Each faction has special cards and you must have cards from only 1 faction in deck. However there is card group called ""Neutral"" which are cards that you can use with any faction. There is even lore about game and factions that you can listen to (small audiobook) in game.Game features competitive mode with 30 different ranks and there are daily quests. You even get reward after every season (1 month) depending on your rank, and sometimes there are unique monthly quest rewards.It does of course have problems too, main one is that it is grindy, and it could use more modes Pros:- Unique mix between card games and turn based strategy games- Competitive game mode with 30 ranks and rewards- Game has some depth but its not too complicated for new players- 6 different factions with unique playstyles and over 100 cards - Beautiful and clean pixel art- You can gain all the cards in game for free, and there are some emotes too- Emotes, card backs, skins for certain monsters- Special gauntlet mode where you use random cards instead of your own deck- Daily quests and events with unique rewards from time to time- Practice mode and i think game also has tutorial (cant recall)- Good music and sounds- Lore about factions in a form of audiobook- Steam achievements- Game is alive, there are players playing itNeutral:- This game doesnt actually have chat besides whispers you can use after you add someone as friend. Instead, you can use emoticons and four preset messages during the match. This helps alot to reduce the toxicity of playerbase, however we dont know if the playerbase is actually toxic. Chat system might've been done like this to make profit off of emotes.Cons:- It feels grindy. Newest card pack requires you to play alot in order to fully unlock it. One of the main problems about this is that players who pay will gain serious advantage, especially when the update with new cards hit, until the rest of players earn the cards. Although it is extremely annoying, i respect this because they have to earn somehow from the game and they still let us earn all cards for free which makes the game non p2w- Could use more game modes, or more different maps maybe. If possible, i'd really like to see 2v2, or even more players in one match- No guilds or chat while in lobby- Still waiting for mobile version- Factions can feel unbalanced at certain times			"

												Magic: The Gathering meets Chess.That's how I heard about, and that's kind of how it is. A CCG with a board, where positioning is one of the most important aspects of the match (unless you're ♥♥♥♥ing Songhai). It is free with options to acquire Spirit Orbs (boosters) for real money, but totally fair for players that don't want to spend any money. The crafting system is really fair, and there is a bunch of powerful cards of common rarity.The monthly season system is very fair and it gives rewards in the form of new cards at the end of it, the rewards is based on your highest position in the month (also you cannot drop Divisions, like S Rank, Platinum, Gold and Silver) once you obtained it. Two monthly patches as well!The pixel art seems to be a hit or miss, some people hate it, and some people love it (I find it astonishing well made)			"

I can't even make myself hate it after losing multiple matches in a row. It just shows me I can get better at it.And last but not least - this game is an honest free-to-play, Even starter decks are powerful, in-game currency allows you to expand your deck pretty fast.

												If you enjoy SRPGs or other Tactical turn-based games like X-Com and used to play Magic: the Gathering or enjoy Hearthstone you should really give Duelyst a shot.  Factions play out somewhat uniquely like the colors of Magic and your creature cards are actually played on a grid and can move and be deployed defensively.  Ranged creatures can actually try to stay physically distant from melee creatures. Good deck-building is rewarded but the game can be played rather casually as well.			"

It's a very fun game of strategy, combat, lore, pixel and real-art combos, and even more great goodies. 8.5 out of 10.			"

												I'm just saying again, as others have said, that there is a solid amount of potential here in its presentation and gameplay, but the price of the paid content is just too high.  On the plus side, the sprite art is impressive, the combination of card game and strategy RPG mechanics is deep and engaging, there is a great amount of variety in the factions and units available, and the length of each match is just right.  But if the paid content remains so expensive, I just foresee the game becoming either too expensive to support itself on the income it makes from the paying community or becoming truly pay to win in order to provide incentives for more people to pay that price.  Neither option is particularly appealing.  That said, I do still recommend people at least try it because the game itself may be worth that price to some.			"

												Not sure why this game is getting so many bad reviews. At low levels, you can easily progress using basic (free) cards, and you can get a decent way into the higher ranks having crafted a few staple common (cheap) cards. The grinding in this game is considerably less than in literally any other F2P game I've played in the last two years.Regular updates. Complex, satisfying gameplay. True, some factions are currently more prevalent than others, but CPG actively balances the most powerful cards to make sure that the meta doesn't stay fixed from month to month. Crazy weird synergies can be found anywhere.Example: let's take the powerful dinosaur man faction, throw in spell cards which deal damage to summon minions at lower cost, then include minions which spawn other minions/deal AOE damage/deal damage directly to their General/etc, and we have one crazily powerful deck with 100% more green lizard men./r/duelyst is a great place to go for links to all the guides, starting out tips, FAQs and miscellaneous chat about the game. Give the game a try and have fun!			"

												I love CCGs (Collective Card Games) but my favourite so far is Duelyst without a doubt. This game is like a combination of an online card game(like Hearthstone) and a tactical turn-based rpg (like Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics), so if you like those type of games you are going to love this one.The best things about this game:Easy to learnEasy to understand mechanics Really fun and fast-pacedEvery play you make requires a lot of thought as positioning matters a lot in this gameLess RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t than other online card gamesHigh gold income from quests and victoriesEasy to get rare cards from packsYou don`t need to spend money or grind a lot to get a decent and competitive deckYou may struggle at first but once you know how the game works, the key cards for each faction and how to position your units properly you'll rank up in the ladder easily.

												Positives:I've had my backside handed to me by decks made using only common and rare (read: uncommon) cards. And it had nothing to do with luck either. They were just good. Very well balanced with the exception of a few odd cards, but the developers stay on top of everything and release nerfs and buffs quickly when needed. Grid based gameplay makes so much sense for the extremely Hearthstone-esque style. Every game feels like at least 80-90% skill as you think carefully about your positioning before each move, add up all the numbers, and try and deny your opponent the advantage.Much like a certain other card game, you have several factions all with unique playstyles and a choice of two generals that changes the way the deck plays. Some brief examples: Abyssians flood the board with puny minions or produce shadow creep that damages enemies when they stand on it. Lyonar have loads of bulky minions and support spells to face threats head-on and bog the opponent down under massive bodies. Songhai are the assassins that specialize in aggro tactics, ranged minions, and high damage combos. Magmar are a bunch of huge lizards who specialize in becoming unreasonably powerful if left unchecked.And here's the kicker: a lot of the paid stuff is really reasonable. If you can earn it with cash you can earn it in game and it never feels like you're climbing a mountain-sized progress bar for something that you could be forking out $2.99 for. If you do decide to spend some cash, you get pretty reasonable value too. I dropped $20 to support the publishers for a great game, and got (all up) 3 guranteed legendaries and 17 booster packs worth 5 cards each (one guranteed rare per pack). Better yet I did the math later and figured out that I could have got a better deal. Negatives:I love all the art personally, but almost everyone I've talked to seems to have a problem with either the hand-drawn stuff or the pixel art. Minor grievance but worth noting if you are bothered easily by art. The match announcer at the start is also a bit jarring and doesn't really mesh with the rest of the game. There are a few combos using mainly epic cards that can flatten newer decks, but that doesn't often happen in bronze and by the time you get to silver you should be armed to put up a good fight at the very least.As far as microtransactions go, the loot boxes you are sometimes given are the only really irksome part. The first one comes with a key but after that there doesn't seem to be any way to get more for free, and the highest level chest required $10 for a key. The chests contain guranteed high value cards and cool cosmetics (which can all be earned free anyway), but in my opinion they don't contain enough items to warrant their current pricetag. I've been letting my loot crates form a dusty pile in the corner for now, as I heard somewhere that a free source of keys is on the developers to do list.Overall:Great developer support, tactical gameplay, fairly well balanced. Mostly good monetization (the bad bits are easy to ignore and nothing is locked off to free players).			"

												I'll be honest, when I saw duelyst at first all I thought is ""what a waste of good art"", so I didnt really try to get into it. but after some time of it being out, a free humble bundle code was given out, so I thought why not just try the game, the worst that could happen is me opening 20 orbs. But what a mistake that was... Now I almost have 500 in the game, and I dont regret anything.For people who are not sure yet if they want to play duelyst or not, you should. The pixel art is amazing, the gameplay is very unique compared to most card games since you have to position your minions in a stratigic way, and the community is pretty good too.The only problem duelyst has is its dying playerbase, now dont get me wrong, there are plenty of people playing the game, just not that many. They are realising a new expansion soon, and mobile support is supposed to come out early next year, so I expect more people to come play duelyst by the start of next year			"

I do find the combats more satisfying than hearthstone because of the positioning of ones minions and general on the battlefield and the visuel animation of the different characters when they attack each other, I do find the game a bit pay to win untill you have unlocked all the cards.

They update the game twice a month with new features, bug fixes and usually four new cards.  Sets come every one in a while.  Rewards pop up way more frequently than hearthstone.  Wait times for games are about 10 seconds.  The game is a turn based strategy board game.  You move your cards on 9 x 5 board and try to kill the guys 25 life.  Pretty standard fare.  There's a tutorial at the beginning of the game.  The game is fun.  I've been playing for around six months though the steam numbers may say otherwise.			"

The art is nice, the different factions well balanced, and the games are pretty quick.

												To whom it may concern,I am a player who sees A LOT of potential in this game and I enjoy playing it a lot. In the past couple of months I have sent about 3 emails to the dev team but nobody has come back to me with a response yet. I have some suggestions that I believe will make the game a lot better. First, when I want to minimize the game window, the music of the game still plays in the background, and I really wish there was a button in the audio settings that allows players to turn off continuous music playing in the background so that it does not feel annoying sometimes that you just turn down the music volume completely. Moreover, I wish I could get some Spirits even if in little amounts from the Spirit Orbs so that disenchanting cards does not become the MAIN way of obtaining Spirits, make it easier for us to get the cards we want pretty please. And last but not least, this suggestion I have been DYING to get through to you guys because I really think it will make this game become more competitive and more user-friendly. Can you please bring Duelyst to the App Store and Google Play and build a scross-platform system just like Hearthstone? You guys have to trust the community's demands because you're not stripping away ANYTHING from this amazing game, but you're only ADDING more to what's already amazing! I know so many YouTubers who will MOST DEFINITELY play your game if it was on the App Store and Google play and I'll name some of them off the top of my head right now: Nickatnyte, GAMINGwithMOLT, BenTimm1 and phonecatss. All of them are very well-known YouTubers inside of their communities. Plus, I really badly wish I could play Duelyst wherever I go, and whenever I want. It is good to be powered by Steam, but if you take the risk and expand with the intention of conquering the market, you will succeed, because I assure you, I have searched the App Store and Google Play in hopes of finding a turn-based strategy game that was THIS good and I have found almost nothing that lived up to my own expectations as an average turn-based games' player (other than Hearthstone). Electronic Arts has released a card game just very recently called Plants vs Zombies: Heroes, and YouTubers instantly started streaming it on various streaming websites such as YouTube Gaming, Twitch, Kamcord and Azubu and it is running EA's business because these Streamers are apparently advertising their game for them. Bottomline, despite the fact that what I'm about to say is just MY opinion, but I really think that Duelyst offers something (in the turn-based genre) that Hearthstone does not have and will NOT have which is an actual gridded board for ACTUAL strategic positioning of each card, plus, EA's new game PvZ Heroes does not have what it takes to actually be primarily strategic rather than just pile up some good cards together and the better combo wins, because from what I have seen in streams and playing the game, that's how PvZ Heroes is for the most part. I am NOT here to dis on other games, but instead I feel like the Duelyst dev team is not trying to make this game more widely known and played on a very competitive level using the simplest way to make sure that ALL players will have access to it which is through the App Store and Google Play. I know some people who do NOT even have a PC, but they have multiple generations of tablets. And to clarify my point, I am not saying the game is bad on steam, but I am humbly asking of you to expand your platform coverage so that you could captivate people's hearths with this game, and I am only sending this to show you guys what you are capable of! No one cares if the game has superior pixels because I bet you guys are a group of gamers too and you KNOW that your game is epic and that this style of play will appeal to sooooo many people, all you have to do is take the risk and conquer! If you need more info or feedback I will be really happy to share whatever it is that I can suggest to make this game a lot better. And I am looking forward to hearing what you guys might think of this suggestion and I apologize for the long message but please do read it.- Blurreth			"

												This is one of the best tactical strategy card games to come out on Steam. The gameplay is amazing, with beautiful graphics, a superb soundtrack, and endless cobinations of decks. The characters and plot come together to make an excellent gaming experience. Definitely the defining game of its genre. 9/10			"

												It is very similar to Hearthstone and yet the differencies are enough to take it as a whole new game. The chess board you play on brings a new level of depth with new or modified card effects adapted to make you care about positionning. You can also add the fact that : - you can replace one card of your hand per turn,- your hero can trade every turn and strike back every time a minion attacks him,- his hero power (called BBS here) is a very strong but limited ressource at first,- the RNG part of the game is very minor compared to HSAll these differences change considerably the dynamic of the game and I would say the game has a very high skillcap.Its community is also growing regularly and I would say the game is more beginner-friendly than HS with all the challenges created to teach you the basics. I have to add that, while the decks can hold 3 of the same legendary, the drop rate of rare+ cards in each pack in way higher than it is in HS so you'll have no problem building good decks.			"

												Found this game through Humble Bundle a little over two months ago, and have played it since. I was a bit fed up with Hearthstone's overreliance on RNG, and though this game isn't perfect, it's got some good ideas. The visuals also happen to be amazing- each unit with its unique pixel art and animation, no corners cut. However, some of the audio could use some work, though I'm saying this mainly because I'm not a fan of the victory voiceover, as it feels like it clashes somewhat with the feel of the rest of the game. Considering this is a free-to-play game, I would highly suggest everyone to give it a try whether they have had previous turn-based/card game experience or not.There is a decent-sized community on Reddit already despite this game being fairly new, so beginners can easily find support for anything ranging from deck-builds to fanart.

												I won't beat around the bush here: Duelyst is Hearthstone with a board. But the addition of the board makes such a difference. The element of positioning is so important that the skill ceiling is raised, and it is possible to play with a weaker deck than your opponent and out-play them on the board.The monthly balance changes are great for mixing up the meta too. Sure, you get a bunch of whining on the forums but I've been very happy with how they're approaching it.			"
