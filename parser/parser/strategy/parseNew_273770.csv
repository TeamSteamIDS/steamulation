												There's a major problem with this game at the time of this review being written: There's no executable file. The game doesn't run. If you buy this, you will be throwing your money away on a game that does not, cannot, run.Someone in the forums linked to an archive on dropbox that is supposed to fix the problem by flat out replacing the game files, but seriously, don't get suckered like I did, just go buy a better game that actually works, like Game Dev Tycoon, or Game Dev Story.TL;DR: Don't buy, it doesn't work.

												One of the most counter-intuitive games I have ever had the misfortune of playing. This game is so raw and unpolished. Some of the screens are still in German. I'm fairly certain there are only 2 voice actors for a multitude of characters. The tutorial is far from user friendly. For a game about games and the industry, you'd think this studio might have taken a moment to consider their audience / customers. Just terrible.			"

												Dopey me, I mistakenly thought this was a sequel to Game Dev Tycoon, which I actually enjoy.  Alas, this is a completely unrelated (and FAR inferior) game.Terrible, terrible interface design; horrible (and buggy) tutorial; actual game play is dull and confusing.Do not bother purchasing this game, it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever!  :-(If you think this concept sounds interesting, I would seriously recommend you check out Game Dev Tycoon instead.  It's a pretty simplistic model of the game development industry, but quite decent for a casual, under-$10 title, and far more interesting with a much better user interface.			"

												AWEFUL, after waiting a day for them to fix the missing executable problem the game is lacking in some necesarry features.  such as: the ability to mute sound effects without muting voices, the ability to go directly to an office rather than needing to all over the place, the tutorial doesn't tell you specifically where a place is, you can't change the resolution, you can't customize your apearance, too much back and forthe (why would a starting developer have an office in a seperate building for himself while his programmers and whatnot work in a different building).  To name a few problems.  This is aweful, Game Dev Tycoon is much more enjoyable.			"

Info for deaf and hard of hearing people:No subtitles. I pretty much can't play it. Not sanely anyway.Cons: The intro movie looks like it's made in the early 1990s. Think Theme Hospital. There are absolutely no options except for volume levels. Even though you can turn the volume all the way down, there are no subtitles. Tutorials are only spoken. Don't blame me if I don't know how the game works. Steam's Release Date: 11 Feb. 2014. It's probably a decade older than that. Buggy. It asks you to do things you already did and ignores that fact so you can't advance. Buggy^2. Not intuitive, or it simply won't respond to the seemingly correct clicks. Buggy^3. Starting to get convinced that this is secretly a pixel-hunt game.Pros: ... Oh wait, maybe one: Trading cards. If you're into those. :PConclusion:Avoid. "

												Game Tycoon is a very unique tycoon game to the point it could be considered a point and click adventure / tycoon game. Nothing is laid out with menus, its all places and locations. You have a university, office plaza, media plaza and your home (which seems pointless). In these locations they are like city streets, you need to scroll your mouse left and right and click on doors. One click will have your player character enter, two clicks will automatically enter. When inside a building, you see a room and need to find what you want to do. It makes the controls needlessly cumbersome. To see how many copies you have in stock, you need to go across town. To see your finances, you need to go back across town. It is crazy.The game is very click base as if it could be a mobile game, you won't find hot keys or even menus. Right mouse clicking exits you out of an area. Stats and charts need to be found in rooms and areas. Even then, there's no depth. There is no way to see how well games are selling, you just need to hope they sell well that month at the price you've set. You can visit a university magazine stand to find out the most popular games and genres for $4 each time. You can visit a game store in the media plaza to see where your games rank. You can visit an advertising executive to publicize your games, your company and see how you stack compared to the two other companies you're competing against. You can even visit a banker, take out a loan, buy and sell stocks of your company and the other three. Those are nice features, but when you visit the banker and executive, you need to talk with them. Click something to say and listen for them to say it before you can continue. If you dare click on something else it could cause a glitch that will loop the speech if not crash a menu 10 seconds later. It is stunning.When you play, there is no hand holding. I needed to figure out to visit my office, create a game engine (or license one), then click and drag the 'print out' into my inventory. Then go next door to the development office? Once there, I need to click and drag the 'print out' into the project list. After that, since I had no employees, I had to go to the university and figure out that I needed to click a bulletin board in order to find employees. The hiring system is nice, it shows you the quality in stars, and their tempo to complete the job. You hire programmers, artists and composers. Some you can hire and others that are independent. So they can get better jobs and come back to you when you need them most, but they don't get paid when they're not working. Then its back to the development studio with my employees. I need to click the project, then assign programmers to the engine and click start project.After you wait a few in game days, weeks or months, its time to take that game engine project, click and drag it back into your inventory, then go next door to your office and make a new game after clicking and dragging the engine into the proper position. Creating a new game project is easy. You'll get to chose things like what languages and what platforms. By platforms I mean, PC, arcade and console. There are no specific consoles. Just those three. Then when that is all 'printed out,' its back over to next door to click and drag the 'print out' from my inventory into the project window. Once there, I need to click on the project, then sift through my employees to assign programmers, artists and composers. The more people I have working, the faster they'll get done. The higher quality they are, the better the game.From there, you don't just release the game. Once you click and drag the finished project into your inventory of course. Its off to the manufacturing facility where you click on the design table to include everything that will come with your game. By design, I mean pack the box with stuff and raise the manufacturing cost. Shirts, buttons, stickers, black and white instruction manuals, color instructions, an insert. Its all up to you! With some click and dragging. With that done you'll visit the manufacturing machine that will churn out the copies of your game. The more copies, the cheaper they become to manufacture. Click and drag the finished product into the machine. Then start manufacturing! After a few game days, all of the copies will arrive.Do they just sell themselves? Nope. Time to find a publisher! So you need to visit a publisher's office and select a publishing deal from books on the wall. They all have minimum quality ratings, so your 45% quality game can't be published with a 53% quality deal. There is a punishment for failing to release the game by the allowed time and for your trouble of making a game, you'll get 6% of the profits depending on the deal. Some deals are far better than others.After that, its back to the factory that has your copies. You need to click on the pallet with the finished copies and click and drag your publishing deal from your inventory into the game's slot and flip the checkmark switch to officially release it! Wasn't that easy? No hand holding at all!Of course 5 hours into the game, I finally discovered the tutorial was in the campaign, but wasn't marked as a 'tutorial.' I thought it was just another scenario in the campaign. The tutorial explains what to do, but it gets caught on itself and could explain things better, such as flipping through a gaming magazine had me clicking all over before I figured out to click a game title. The voice over will talk over other voice overs. Not just that, but if you go to a different location than you should be in, the tutorial narration will tell you what to do as if you're in the correct place, instead of saying no this is the office, go to the university.As soon as you get the hang of the 1,000 step process, it becomes an insane juggle of going between locations since there is no menu. Waiting to pan the street to the right or left. Waiting for your character to walk to the building before you realize double clicking enters the door instantly. Even though there's a game speed, that doesn't speed up the character. It doesn't speed up every time I need to hear 'I would like a bank loan,' then hear the banker's rebuttal.There are visual errors here like text not disappearing when the dialog boxes do. Text overlapping out of windows. Sometimes the ticker PDA doesn't show anything when it should have a message. The PDA (ticker) is nice, it pops up useless information like you need to pay $3,000 for golf clubs or you're having a bad hair day. Its all random things that might as well be Chance cards from Monopoly. The PDA pop up changes the game from fast to slow, which is good, but the problem is that a lot of what the PDA shows is useless moments to make you laugh. You didn't sleep well, because your bed broke. Stealing MP3s is bad. Visit the gametycoon website. Your employees will get sick and will be unable to work for 12 days.The only way to get a game over is if you go into debt for more than 90 days. You can get loans and sell stock to stay a float, but even on normal, it seems difficult. Your games only make money at the start of every month. You have full control over the price of your games at the factory, but to put publicity into the games, you need to go to a different area down the street.The game itself is difficult even on normal. Luckily there is an easy mode. To top everything off, it has crashed or permafroze a few times, so you'll need to keep saving frequently, since there is no auto save feature. With all of that being said, there are some interesting elements in the game, but the juggle and struggle of going location to location over and over again is unfun and begging people to not play it. If only there was a menu and no traveling. The time it takes to hear people talk is just too long with no way to skip it.			"

												Game Tycoon 1.5 is little more than a disgracefully bad rip-off of the better known (and generally better all around) Game Dev Tycoon.This game was apparently released in February 2014, but the laughable 3D graphics would not be out of place in a game fifteen years older. Upon starting the game, you are given a choice of three avatars to choose from, with no customisation whatsoever. After this sequence, and some terrible wooden voice-acting, you are whisked away to a street where you are told to make your avatar walk painfully slowly to your office. And no, there is no way to speed this up.The game tells you to create a game engine, then gives you almost no advice on how to do so, which leads to lot of trial-and-error clicking in the laughably rough looking interface which looks like something knocked together in 30 seconds on Photoshop. You are then told to walk down the street to the bank, where you borrow money (ask for whatever you like, and the clerk simply hands it over), and then it's off to the ""university"" to hire some staff (in reality just a hanging noticeboard where you click on people's names). Returning to your office, you click once more through the interface to assign your newly hired staff to work on your engine project. You then wait...and wait...and wait. Turns out that there's no way to speed this up, and there's nothing else to do but stare at the inside of your blocky 3D office.At this point, I turned the game off, so I don't know if your hardworking crew eer do finish working on that engine in order for you to start working on your game proper. The final irony is that a game supposedly all about making your own games is a terrible game in itself with no thought for it's audience. Who were they aiming for with this game? Game makers themselves? Masochists? Poor saps not realising that they'd bought the wrong game with a similar sounding title and not realising it until it was too late?On top of its aforementioned problems, there are other glaring flaws; screens untranslated from their original German, and some garbled English phrases that look like they've been through the wringer that is Google Translate. It feels like a game that not only isn't finished, but that's been slapped together with little care or thought, leaving an absolute travesty of a game that should not have been released.I don't normally write reviews, but this one inspired me to do so. I got the game for free, and actually earned money by selling the steam cards I got for playing it, and I still feel ripped off. Do not pay any money for this ""game"".			"

												Definitely my pick for the worst game of the year. Every tedious action that the player is forced to endure could have easily been just a click of a button. For instance walking my character to one office to print a design for an engine, then going to the production office to place the design on the project board could have been just one click of a button. There is no way to skip to the end of a project while it is in production and the player is forced to sit and watch a clock at it ticks away.I never judge a game based on graphics or sound, unless of course one of these features does not work properly. During the tutorial a man's voice tells you what to do, but even when you are doing what he is telling you to do he repeats what he said. This does not stop his previous sound file, but instead doubles over it and explodes your ears if you are using headphones. Also while in the game manufacturing place the mans voice is completely drowned out by annoyingly loud industrial sounds. I'm fairly certain there is only one voice actor that does the voice of every single character. This is not an exaggeration; this game seriously gave me a headache five minutes into it.			"

												Alright, after the initial launch problems were fixed I was looking forward to a nice bit of tycooning in the gamedevelopment industry, boy was I dissapointed. There are some really basic ""generic flaws"" and then there are the ""content flaws"".For the generic flaws the controls are pretty counter-intuitive (Escape always takes you to the main meny, right mouse click escapes from the screen), there is no pause option! For me pause is an important option, I mean even if it wasn't....The contrast in sounds is horrible, when playing the tutorial you will barely be able to hear the person explain the game due to the background sounds (also the voiceacting is just horrible, I would have rather had no voiceacting at all), besides that the tutorial is just horrendous and not user friendly at all. Also, every notification slows your game down, so when it feels the need to tell me kids threw stuff at my house or that my competitors made a new game it slows my game down again, this is really tedious as the messages are irrelevant to me!Now the obvious lackluster, depth, there is nothing to be gained here, you can't train your people, you can't invest in anything. The only thing you do is wait and watch the boards while you again click on a ""genre & language(s)"" to create the concept for you new game. As time progresses you get new technology available but not through any effort of yourself. Then there is another thing, I need to take a publisher contract to push my games to stores, but for some weird reason I have to print my own discs and keep track of that stock! That is NOT gamedevelopment, that is what the publishers are supposed to do for me.There is another game like this available on Steam which just blows this title away, I was dumb enough to think this was the sequel, save your money, buy the other title!

Gameplay PremiseThe premise of the gameplay is simple. To be the best game tycoon. This is a simulator game, so some semblance to the facts are expected.TutorialThe tutorial is spoken, there is no subtitle, and there is no explanation on what should be done. For example : You are told to borrow $100k from the bank, but you are not told where the bank is and how to even sign the paper. You are told to manage your developer, and you are not told where is your developer office (turns out, the development office is separate from your personal office). In short, the tutorial is not helpful at all.The UIThe UI is very bad. There is no tooltips at all. If you hover over something, there won't be any explanation. As UI is related to how information is given out to you, this game is also very bad at that. To access your game quality, you have to go to a certain object. To access your sales number, you have to click on some paper on your table. To access your financial report, you have to click on another paper on your table. There is no collated financial reports, no collated engine/game reports. Some reports have to be accessed outside your personal office, which you must travel to other place just to get a piece of report.The notion of personal office looks like Airline Tycoon Deluxe, which are a great game. In Airline Tycoon, there are tooltips so that we know what we are going to click. To access the incoming message, just click on the paper organizer in your office. To access your plane facilities, click on the plane model. To access the fuel price and setting, click on the fuel painting on the wall. To access your route, click on the globe. To access your financial report, just a click away. This is very different with Game Tycoon 1.5.Game Tycoon 1.5 fails to present the information needed with a good manner, information is fragmented. For tycoon games failure to present information is very bad, as those information are the key to success in these kind of games.The GameplayThe gameplay is horrid. There are no clear explanation.What is the differences between Keyboard controller and Joystick? Japanese language and English language? No explanation at all. The game is too complex.Not complex in a good manner. To build a game, you have to create an engine. During the creation of engine, you have to enter the features (like Game Dev Tycoon) though it's unclear which features is better than the others. During the creation of engine you are also able to set how many developers are going to develop the engine. Next, you have to print it and it is stored at your inventory. After that, you have to go to the university, and grab some developers.After that, you have to go to the developers office (beside your office, they have darts targeting your character) and assign programmers to the project. No problem on this part.After that, you develop the game, same thing, you have the game ""cassette"" on your inventory. Then, you have to go to design factory to define how much gimmicks you wanted. Then you go to factory to print out your product. Then to licensing to find a publisher. Then to factory again to sell the game.The process is believable, but presented in such clunky manner that you will be confused in no time. While a good game will present all of those above steps in a UI that have drop-down menus, this game is not. As outlined above, because information is too fragmented. For example : After printing out your product, you go to publisher. The publisher demands your game have a specific rating. If you have printed your game, you can't know the rating anymore, the rating is known only after the game is developed. These kind of thing is very bad, information should be able to be accessed at all times!No feedbackWhile the Game Dev Tycoon provides feedback to the player by giving out review scores, this game did not give any. Review scores are important to give us facts how good is our product. But no dice, no feedback, no nothing. In tycoon games it is important to have feedback. For example, if we are told that our sales drop in such areas, we should know the cause. Bad product? Bad pricing? Bad sales? We must have information. This game lacks those, so the players could not make informed decisions to make something.Bad Game StructureNo menus. Simply horrid. You can't access functions inside the game, you have to go out to main menu to get that. You can't go to settings, you have to go to main menu to access settings. Not to mention that the game will drop to desktop for a few second if you go to main menu. That is simply unacceptable.Look and FeelSimply lacking. The game has some quality in drawing, but very lacking in other aspects. The music is bad.  Final VerdictI got this game from a bundle, so it is not a bad loss to me.STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.I think this game is the Big Rigs of tycoon genre. "

												I've played some bad games in my 30 years, but this one is special.  Tutorial tells you to do something without any explanation as to how, and the guy trying to explain things to you is often overpowered by other sound effects.  The game is psuedo translated using EU conventions while speaking english, such as commas in place of periods.  It's also very time intensive and makes the fast forward feature almost useless as pointless news reports (""You are a beatiful person, gain 5000 dollars""??)  pop up and slow time back down.  I don't know if I can properly convey just how bad this game is.If you're a person that loves horrible games for the novelty of bad games, then yeah, this is perfect, otherwise, Game Dev Tycoon is much better, and alot more fun.  Don't buy unless you love bad games.			"

												If you enjoy confusing tutorials, confusing intefaces, and voice acting that makes you want to rip your own face off, boy have I got the game for you!The game would have been much better served by a text tutorial and more clearly marked items.  In places it speaks of going to things that it hasn't mentioned yet or explained where they are leaving you wondering exactly what it is you're supposed to be doing.  Tutorials are supposed to make a player understand the game, not make them rage quit in frustration.Perhaps there's a worthwhile experience somewhere in there for someone who is determined enough to slog through and endure the frustration required to find it.  But it seems that only people very hungry for another experience like Greenheart's game could even be expected to do so and will likely be the most disappointed by this offering.  For me personally I just want  the 45 minutes of my morning I spent with this title.			"

												Yes, all the reviewers are correct, this is a shameless money grab. This is the first game I have ever played where I needed to look up a Let's Play to understand the tutorial. Nope, not kidding.I would (maybe) have worked around the impractical and unintuitive controls and interface. I would have potentially even tried to understand its odd mechanics (though how they have managed to make the mechanics so obtuse in a childish tycoon game, I have a hard time grasping, that takes talent). And I could have theoretically looked past the language mistakes and all the incomprehensible game design choices. But I will draw the line at the glitches and crashes. Mainly because I was actually thankful when this game crashed on me and I could go on with my day.Don't do this to yourself.			"

												I only get stuck at the first tutorial or any other gametype. As I try create my first engine and hit save, it just freezes and shows a saving symbol over my mousepointer, but nothing ever happens. It forces me to eventually restart and start over.As a game about creating games, it kind of fails at its own concept.			"

												It would be incredibly hard if not for an exploit where you can make almost any crap game, print a million copies of it (so they're less than a buck a copy) and ""sell off"" the game, netting you a tidy profit (the game thinks that selling every copy for like 2 dollars is often a huge loss except you're moving such volume it breaks the game)Glitchy, unintuitive and just obtuse at times, it's nearly unplayable in any enjoyable form.

												Looking at the screenshots, I thought this was going to be an upgraded version of Game Dev Tycoon. I didn't even bother looking up gameplay videos. Turns out, they badly implement ""exploration,"" which is really just a way to slow down the game and distract from what you're actually trying to do.The tutorial is more or less useless, with instructions that give you just enough details to get frustrated, but not enough to actually tell you what's going on.There's a great video on youtube with a title along the lines of ""Let's NOT Play Game Tycoon 1.5."" It does a pretty good job of explaining why you should avoid this one.			"

												I think the only properly functioning part of the game is shown in the video!While it was released in 2006 originally, it feels horrid and incomplete. The ""tutorial"" barely shows you how to complete tasks, much less informing you which building is what! Some of the sound effects are so loud that they drown out what little instruction there is... when the volume isn't randomly resetting to ear-splitting defaults. Too bad there woudn't be any use to requesting a refund... Poor quality isn't grounds for a refund anymore, though.			"

												Games like this really bring Steams lack of a proper return policy to light. This game was launched 100% broken with missing EXE files and the developers tried multiple fixes on the forums before figuring out an issue so simple it's embarrasing.There are a ton of problems with this game. Half the interface is hidden random items in the envoriment making it a pixel hunt to bring up the most basic of menues. The menus there are are unintuitive and lack any kind of explination as to what the functions are. The is no proper tutorial or even tool tips on icons and buttons.There have also been reports of people encountering German menus within the English version of the game, but I honestly didn't manage getting that far.This is probably one of the worst game on Steam and I'm ashamed of having purchased it. It this kind of release that make it apparant how poor or non existing Valves quality control on Steam releases are. This is simply pathetic.			"

												The concept is good, but the game is so poorly executed that I greatly regret buying it. I also feel bad for not reading the reviews first. My instinctual thought when I saw the game is that it was a sequel to a good game called game dev tycoon. Then realised it wasn't, but wanted to give it a chance. The tutorial is very bad and the advisor repeats himself too much.  I became stuck at the point where he says ""go to the warehouse and click on the table to find publishing deals"" I found no publishing deals I clicked on the trash bin and noticed the options weren't in english I researched and the options are ""trash"" ""sell off cheap"" or ""keep"" you wouldn't know if you don't speak the language though. This would be an alright Alpha to a game, personally I feel very ripped off. In fact this is the first negative review I've ever bothered to write after years as a gamer. From now on I will be sure to read a review before I leap to buy a game which looks interesting.			"

I picked one. Finished making the game and was sent to packing and to the production of copies. Finished those and then was told to add the publishing deal.Guess what.. Was told the game is not good enough for the publishing deal.. How can a game be not good enough before it was released and given a rating?? How the hell do you give publishing deals in the tutorial and don't even explain anything about them? Or even explain how to get rating for the game.Sorry, total crap. At least it gives cards.			"

												***edited ***  -- I have found a way to play this game, but I realised that this game needs a better tutorial and also some of the translations are wrong from german to English, making features of this game seem strange to native language english people.*** End of Edit ***Scratches head...  Scratches bottom... goes to make coffee.  This is a list of things you should do before buying this game.Basically the game concept has the correct idea, the implementation and system they have gone through is daft.I hire people who can produce a low quality of work, for cheap.  The publishers demand a Top quality game (88% rating) and will charge me 90,000 if I fail to produce the game in 2 months!! seriously, are they deluded?  this game has probably been in production for more than two months.  The game engines you can rent (single game production only) are 10k +  you are lucky to make that much money on a produced game.To produce a game engine...  DO NOT MAKE A CHEAP GAME ENGINE EVER.  Go straight to building the best engine you can, with every feature.  if you don't it's a waste of time and money.When you hire people... pay attention to their Quality only.  if it takes them 10 months to make a super good game... Then thats better than a low quality game produced in 10 days. Publisher contracts run out.  Pay attention to how long you have to fill the contract. (making the contract and producing the game they want does not say the game will even sell...)Basically this game gives you massive overheads of a full sized game company, with the technical production skills of a guy in a garage producing a game for a publisher.  (games of the 80's were not made in big offices with big budgets).The game needs a scaling system from start to finish, 0-30% ratings on games for the start and 88%+ in the finish when you have good staff.

												This game is about as badly made as is possible to make.The purpose of the game is to fulfill 'goals'But these goals don't seem to add up to creating a successful business. Even if it did, due to bugs in the game it's impossible to create a successful business from it.For instance, if you create and publish a game and sell every copy of that game that you can create at an enormous profit, you don't actually get a penny of it.Essentially, the ONLY income you can get in the game is to take out a loan from the bank. And when you run low on funds you have to take out another loan and another and another and another. This makes it rather broken from a business sim perspective.Additional issues include not being able to publish a game unless the randomly generated publishing contracts fulfill the merits of a game. So you can create a game and not be able to publish it for months and months. Not that it matters since you can't earn off it anyway.Basically, this is NOT Game Dev Tycoon, which is what you probably wanted to buy but the title of this tricked you into looking here. If you haven't paid a penny for it already, DON'T! If you have bought it then you have my condolences.			"

												At first those screens looked nice, but that is all which got this game. No chance to edit screen resolution, the tutorial misses a lot things. in addition it is hard to see when you could scroll to the left or right so you find those other points of interest. the whole game feels like an early beta and i hope the developers will give it a patch to fix some of these stuff, cause i think it is has a good concept and tries another aproach to those game dev genre. but at the moment it is not worth the money.

												Warming this game is not related to Game dev tycoon at all. I brought this thinking it was game dev tycoon only to get a♥♥♥♥♥♥slapped in my face. First of all the sliders on the main menu does not work at all, if you click new game it will take you to a character screen but if you go back to the main menu then the game WILL reboot itself. The voice acting is crap only 2 voices was used. The game looks like it was made back in 2003. Even warZ looks better than this♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game is not user friendly at all and sometimes the game like to spit out some german text. I made a review about this game and in the end I would rather do suicide than to play this game again.for some gameplay and ranting click this link here ->

This game was the fourth game I've reviewed for my ""Steam Redlight"" series, where I review games when they're 'in the red' in reviews to see if it's as garbage as everyone says it is.You can see the review / reaction video here.In summary, this game is broken af and isn't worth getting. Even for free. Time ain't gettin' refunded here. In this game, you're supposed to be playing as a game developer that's supposed to be evolvin' through the ages, and with those ages, you're supposed to be developing better games. Makes sense in theory. The game starts in 1982, and ages from there. Unfortunately I never got to figure out what year the game goes up to because I never really got to play.The game crashed on startup for campaign mode after I tried to cycle past the third character, thinking that the characters cycled. They don't. The game obviously doesn't have enough data to loop back to character one so it decides to suplex your game into a vegetable state. On Windows 10, I also couldn't force close the game with task manager, I had to lobotomize my computer by restarting it, or signing out and signing back in.The game was nice enough to let me play after my fourth attempt, but only when I gave up on Campaign Mode and went into Endless Mode. The bad news is that Endless Mode doesn't have an explanation or tutorial, so I was about as ready and experienced to play the game as a couple who waited until marriage to bang it out for the first time. The game's feature advertised an interactive advisor (for when I needed advice). I saw Clippy approximately zero times during my experiences in Tycoonsville.But after making my industry-breaking engine, and being insulted by my PDA for clicking on a mouse-hole, I sought a loan at my neighborhood loan shark. But as I approached his (or her, never met 'em) den, the game crashed again for the last time.Score & BreakdownScore: 0/10+5 for Existing-1 for having the game crash on me-2 for having the game crash so hard i had to restart my computer-2 for having garbo sound, art, character development, plot, and just about everything elseIf you think this review has the potential to crucify Jesus Christ, then feel free to review its fully URL'd glory below:

												Worthless even when I bought this for $1. Game focuses to much on minor jokes yet there are none...so much background art and nothing to click. Lame tutor spokesman to get you started that doesn't even teach you the stuff that would be much harder to figure out on you own. Game has a cluster of*** art and different places to go with no signs or any way that make for ease access. Game does not speed up fast enough or slow enough for that matter when you want it to. Ultimately this $1 has contributed another burdon that I actually had to painstakenly write this review to realise what a waste of time I spent writing about the $1 I spent. Still for $1 this game is still ridiculously bad and not serious or professional at all. Would be great for a 8 year old...			"

												I have to agree with most other reviews of this game. It's just not anywhere near finished and if it is well then they developers need to recheck their definition of finished.Initially I thought this might be a ""sequal"" to the very impressive Game Dev Tycoon, but when I noticed the publisher was different I figured that it wasn't. But it still went on my wishlist. Anyway a friend bought it for me and now I just feel like I owe him that money back.I guess I'll just reiterate what everyone else has said about this game.The ""controls"" are weird. Right click takes you back a screen, escape sends you to the main menu, everything is click and drag, no really clean selection system.The voice acting was ok, when I could hear it over the background noises. The tutorial was completely a waste since I couldn't hear the narrator over most of the background noises.A lot of the UI was really unresponsive forcing me to have to leave screens and re-enter them just for it to realize I modified an option.So while I applaud the attempt at making a more ""in-depth"" GameDev sim, by including more options for publishing, a few different locations, and trying to make it feel more like a business. Please focus on making sure the game is fairly playable before releasing it.I've seen flash games on the web that have mostly the same design, but not nearly as many of the problems.Added: I went back and watched their ""trailer"" on steam and honestly it even looks like the person who was demoing it had no idea what to do. Also I ran into at least 1 menu still in German?, which happened to be the ""publishing"" menu. That made it pretty damn hard to figure out if I was trashing my newly minted game or sending it to the public.			"

												""The year is 1982"" and it plays like it.I'm exaggerating of course, but even for the 2003's standards (which is when the original version came out. That 2014 release date is just a plain lie, even not counting the original, the 1.5 was released in 2006,) this game is just archaic, on top of being terribly designed, with awful interface that resembles more of a hidden object game rather than a management simulation. Back in the day, there were more Tycoon games that made interfaces in such way, but they were usually better designed, accessible and comprehensible.Even if you would leave aside the design and aesthetic aspects, this game is still a sloppy work. It's riddled with bugs, crashes constantly and while this one problem was already fixed, they have released this game without its .exe file.Removing their names and leaving the blank page in the credits is probably the smartest thing they have done in regards to this whole mess.

												This game started of not that bad but that didn't last long Oh no it lasted for 5 minutes.This game got worse and worse overtime as i gave it a chance to redeem it self it gave me:- VO's that overlap eachother and character mouth animations that play when there is no sound.- A crash after getting the broker to talk to me.- A freeze after changing the audio sliders ( that don't impact audio in the first place)- A blue screen after forcing it to exit Even free is to much for this piece of trash.

												Terrible rip off of Game Dev tycoon (the only reason I bought the damn thing). Usless tutorial, irritating sound that often makes other (more important) audio impossable to make out, clunky gameplay -when certain features actualy work like they're supposed to, that is -, poor English and a tendacy to switch between German and English text for no reason all make this increadably anoying to play.Just a pity I wasted money on this thinking it was the /actual/ game dev tycoon.

												I did not enjoy this game. It has a clunky interface that makes completing simple tasks frustrating at times. Some elements do not work, such as turning off the annoying background music loops. I suppose it is possible to have some fun by exploring scenarios, like running a game company that only makes erotic titles, or checking how fast you can go bankrupt. If you feel that you must play this, be advised: skip the buggy tutorial and try reading the manual instead. Oh, and do not press the Campaign button in the pause menu while playing...			"

												HOLY MOTHER OF BALLS.... WOW! I really wanted this game to be good. Becouse I'm a stratagy game fan. But this... you didn't even have to do a lot right game. But you screw up on so many levels it's not funny. Most of it is just from those minor things, like no subtitles (voice acting is really bad and is hard to hear tutorial when in the production part), the thing with the missing .Exe file which I personally experianced becouse I was like one of the first people to buy it, and there are screens that are not translated from German(has been fixed)... and it's the F###### game delete screen(in game) ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!?! That's the one thing you want to translate, like what if I hit the wrong button (since I can't read German) and delete the game I just created?O.K. that's enough for nitpicks. I honestly have not got too far in this game since the lackluster tutorial fails to explain things like tips and tricks and things of that nature. And this game is not good enough for my time to learn its stratagies and mechanics. That said the one thing this game does get right is the mechanics. Things like contracts and liscences really do make me feel like I'm really running a game company. But this game is so vague in its design it's hard to get inveloped in this world. Oh yeah... the game is either really hard or my 30+ hours of Game Dev Tycoon has tought me nothing about company stratagizing, let alone a game dev companySo with this game being like another Sonic 06 to me as in a game I really wanted/needed to be good but.. nope not getting that genuine game dev experiance here so I give this game a 2.5/10			"

												I usually try to get past the tutorial before I rage quit, but I literally couldn't. It doesn't state how to turn pages in a magazine, it doesn't tell you which buildings are which, you just have to go to each one and randomly click stuff, it doesn't tell you all that much of anything. But what was the most annoying was the guy kept repeating himself and sometimes his speach was either not understandable or you couldn't hear him for the background noise. He'd pop up everytime I was trying to read the stats of the contracts. And who the hell pays just to READ a magazine?! Why wouldn't you get to keep that magazine. I ended up spending about 20 bucks on one stupid magazine that I couldn't even turn the pages in!I am glad I bought this on sell, because it's not worth full price. I'm not the type to ask for 29 cents back, but still I wish they'd put these games as demos if they're going to suck.			"

There are good business simulation games out there and why this game is going so far off I can see what they tried to do, but failed so hard that the sequel must be better right.

												Best experience of a game I've ever had. Greatest game. Would reccomend it to people who love games that give you absolutely no background whatsoever; and games that just crash out of nowhere. This game is also very innovative and different. Instead of telling you what to do, it throws your character into a town where you have absolutely no idea what you're doing. I am one of those people.  Would also erectomend it to peopelo who love sexy graphics. They are so smooth for 1982.			"

TL;DR: I LOVE these types of games, but a terrible UI (That means User Interface for you newbies out there!), the fact that you have to have it windowed or it will (almost literally, but not exactly that) crash your game (that or you need to seriously ♥♥♥♥ with your security), and a TERRIBLE tutorial prevent me from ever wanting to touch this one again.I love these types of games, and, despite the negative reception, I was willing to give this a try.After getting it in a giveaway a while back, I decided to give it a look today. Out of the bunch of similar games I've tried (Game Dev Tycoon, GamersGoMakers, Mad Games Tycoon, Game Dev Story, Game Tycoon 2, Game Corp, and now this), I can officially say: I've hit the bottom of the barrel. This game has so many GOOD ideas that it sucks to see them so poorly executed. I've played GamersGoMakers for over 30 hours on Steam and many more off Steam, but while the mediocre execution in that game doesn't make the game difficult, here it just gave me a headache! It's hard to say why the UI so bad other than 'it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks', but I'll give it a try anyways. The UI is NOT clean in the slightest. You have an invetory which is visible, but I swear to god, the first-second time I was tasked with putting anything in there I was confused so much that I closed the game. I only found out that the icon replacing my cursor wasn't meant to indicate loading by mistake... and I was playing a tutorial the entire time. You can also change the speed of the game (ala The Sims), but there was also no clear indication of this... guess how long it took me to figure out how to do this.Speaking of which, the tutorial. That's one big con within itself. Everything is so vaguely done, you're told to do things, but the UI is never explained so for the majority of it, you'll have badly done voice work yelling at you because you didn't do EXACTLY what the developer wants you to in this situation without ever having a hint of what that is. The sound design is poorly done here, as well. Repeating song loops can be ignored, but it's unforgivable in the circumstance where you're confused. You can turn it off, yes, but there's a chance of it making your game crash should you do it. And, on the topic of game crashes, you can expect to not have the game be playable should you not swap it to windowed mode or leave Windows settings that are meant for security purposes (like, stopping viruses) alone. I gave up on this one pretty early on, and you can probably tell just looking at my playtime. I thought it was a joke how ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal this game is... but, no. This game hurt me to play, and for that reason I can't recommend it, whether you can get it free or paid, pirated or bought. Just don't.Then again, what else did I expect from a game that (literally - no joke here) was originally sold without an executable file?			"

												Having knocked up a couple of hours, I think I'd share some information and feedback about this game. In part, to counter many of the negative reviews that don't give the game the credit it deserves, but also to give an honest perspective.To start with, let me say that it doesn't necessarily deserve the negative feedback that it's getting. The problem here, that I see, is that some are experiencing issues with the game and the software tutorial itself doesn't give a whole lot of help to resolve it. That said, there are some issues that deserve mentioning and some interesting features that also deserve a few words.Graphically, the game is pretty nice and certainly well laid out. There are different areas to head to for specific intentions and it works well. The controls are well thought out and it's effortless to shift between each area. Use of the right mouse button to transition between areas is an boon - since many of this sort of game neglect the use of said button. The music, too, isn't too annoying and blends nicely in the background, with an easy to find method of turning it off and on. It's smooth and not too demanding on modern systems (meaning pretty much any system from the last 5-8 years) but that's to be expected in an older title. The game itself seems to borrow some ideas from other games, which isn't unheard of. There's a few places where I immediately thought of Airline Tycoon/AT: First class. Again, not a bad thing but hardly innovative either. There's lots of clickables in the world, though there's no real explaination of what they do, if anything and I did notice on the official forums/website for the game that there's very limited support for English speaking individuals, whereas there's a wealth of support for German speakers. Hardly the end of the world, but considering the planet is more English speaking than German, maybe something to look at down the line.On to the negatives.To start with, I have to make mention of the lack of subtitles. Many of the spoken lines can be hard to hear through any form of background music, be it ingame or otherwise and with no means to read that spoken word, rather than listen to it, it's a little annoying.Also, the method the game uses to publish your titles. You have to have a contract with a publisher - there's no method of self-publishing (at least, not as far as I got - which was into the early 90s) and promotion of your titles doesn't really seem to fit. This is one of the game-killers for me. I can earn money - make some top notch games but without a method of publishing, I'm limited to the contracts on offer and that, to me, makes little sense. If you're sitting on a few million and you have the means to buy a publishing company, you would if it was financially viable.Also, there's a lack of polishing to this game and, again, I recognise that the game is ancient in PC gaming standards ( 8 years or so). Nevertheless, a little extra work could have made the game more enjoyable. There's a great start here, but it needs more, especially as the tycoon market seems to be pickiing up again and competition is starting to hit the shelves again (Game Dev Tycoon immediately comes to mind).Speaking of which. Another of the features this game is really missing is R+D and this is something that goes right back to the dawn of computer gaming. Without R+D, there would be no innovation, nothing to set the big companies aside from the little. Also, when you take over a competitor, it would be nice if you could keep the name and use it for, say, publishing or research or whatever else your mind fancies, rather than the name disappearing. There's little to stop you from taking over and becoming an umberella company that publishes games from your child-companies. The game, on the whole, is good, though it has little replay value because it ends up being a chore to rinse, lather, repeat. Adding more staff options would help and delegating some of the more mundane tasks to AI workers would allow you to manage the areas you want to, without having to keep doing the same thing over and over. All in all, if you're looking for a distraction and want a few hours of game play here and there, it's worth the investment. It's the sort of game I, personally, would keep going back to while deciding what main project I want to start (Mount fo Blade, Tropico 4, whatever) and it has some value there. However, if you want something more meaningful, either look at Game Dev Tycoon (also an indie title and a demo is available) or wait and see what happens with Game Tycoon 2.			"

												OK..............lets start off by saying this game isn't ""game development tycoon"" *coughs*. Yes, you get to create games and sell them on a market, but I look at it alittle different. At first I found it alittle frustrating trying to figure the game out, why it was so difficult to make any money and lose over and over so quickly even on EASY. This is probably the main reason most people rage and troll the game, not every game is intended for young children with little to no attention span. Now with that elephant out of the room...  The word tycoon, makes me think of business, to rule over all competitors like the a particular board game that just makes everyone mad at each other at the end of the game LOL. So basicly I am saying this game, true to its name is, to at least me, saying that it is a Company trying to be the best business out there..and for those of you that really understand how business works, lets just say it really doesn't matter what you are selling, what it is really about is profit and the benifits you can buy with it once you make more and more of it. I would recommend this game more for mature, oldskewl gamer types. Sometimes its not about the graphics or the gameplay..sometimes its about figuring out how to not be a noob, intil one day you look back and laugh at yourself with great achivement and humility, because you overcame so many of your mistakes. That to me is a real game, pff you kids today are so spoiled with your save points every 10 feet..there used to be a time where one tiny tiny mistake made you completely restart hours and hours of progress. ANYWAY LOL...a few hints for those of you that read all this ribble-rabble. *****HINTS****get a max loan..make any game quick and cheap doesnt matter just get it out into the market and advertise your image alittle. doing this will raise your stock % from a crap share to a few dollars, trust me its a HUGE difference if you have say 1000000 shares... just saying any way once you get like 2-6$ a share sell it all and get a few million in the bank, pay back your loan and SHAZAM! you have just earnd better credit, dont worry you can just make a ""erotic game"" genre to lower your image a.k.a your stock value and just rebuy it at .01 a share just after you sold all of it for 5$ a share LOL and you can rebuild it again and again, trust me this game is uber fun and easy once you get the hang of it, so trolls, go play cod or something and leave the indie games to the professionals :P THANKS FOR READING IF YOU DID,KUZURNOTA-L7WEINER ;D			"

												This game has it's issues.  In full-screen mode, whenever you change windows, the game blinks to the desktop to show you a loading bar, then goes back into the game with the new menu.  There is no useful information in the game, tutorial or otherwise, to get you started.  The audio always works fine, but sometimes the voices seem to work, while other times they don't.  However, if you take the time to watch someone who has learned this game play it on Youtube, I think you will enjoy this game for a while.I watched someone else play, was reminded instantly of MAD TV (an old German DOS game where you run a television station in a similar fashion), then bought the game in a bundle.  It is similar to MAD TV in a few ways.  You run your character around various places to draft ideas for games, hire workers (programmers, artists, composers), buy engines until you can afford to make your own, produce the game, then get a publishing contract, and finally ship the game to stores.  There's even a store you can enter to check the top 10 selling video games, until your game stops making money, where you then can try to sell it or throw it away.  There's an auction to get license for real movies and other popular brands (I had a spoof of Indiana Jones that sold well, but also cost me a lot).  There is enough going on in this game at any given point to where you get in this loop of design, produce, sell, and it might take you a restart or two, but with a little trial and error, you can be successful.Overall, this game is definitely a lower budget title, and it shows.  I would've liked to see a bit more, such as gaming conventions like in Game Dev Tycoon, or even awards that your game could win from reviewers.  But like MAD TV, once you learn the ropes of the game, and finally avoid going bankrupt on your budgets, it's a pretty solid simulator.  Nothing special, but it's definitely entertaining for a couple of hours at least.			"

												First Impressions Balanced and Fair ReviewSo I played just over 70 minutes of this and before I begin I would like to say the missing files has now been fixed.The good: I like how you have to build te engine or can buy another companies one to make a game. As the years pass your options increase for building a better engine. I like the genre choices for making a game and from 2006 the graphics are alright.I like how you have to buy magazines to see trends and reviews for your games and that the quality of your team really plays an impact on the games. I also like how publishers want a certain level of quality for a game and give you a time span (Personally I just make a game then wait for a good publisher).The Bad: Trying to do that tutorial was a chore as you have to wait until he finishes talking to do what he says albiet you have to guess as it never shows you what any of the features are just assumes you know. At times especially in the printing room I couldn't hear him and there are no subtitles.As this is an older game I'm gonna be more lenient but still add here that I have no idea if you can train you employee's or not (I oouldn't find anything) but hiring good employee's is expensive so you have to start off making terrible games.This game has really long waits of doing nothing but the worst part is when you speed the game up the if you get a message on the PDA it goes back to slow. This is annoying when most of the PDA messages are either a joke or you got money. I'm fine with telling me the stock of a game is low or I lost money for some reason but anything else it should keep it sped up.On that note I hate how at the end of the year you are transported back to your office.Overall: My overall rating is a 5/10 it's far from the worst game ever as I've played both Game Dev Story, Game Dev Tycoon and Gamebiz 3. For it's price range it's ok I don't feel cheated. I give it a recommendation but only if you like the genre.			"

												No, this is not a sequel to Game Dev Tycoon, the 2012 gem from Greenheart Games. This is actually a crappy game released in 2006 by some German company who was too lazy to even change some of the text in the game to English (this has actually been quietly patch since). It's unstable now more than ever. Yet, and I think everyone has a game like this, I can't help but keep playing it. Save yourself the $10 if you want, I'll just be in my corner sobbing...			"

												This game is not as bad as people say, in my opinion. Sure, it's a tad old and the original release date should be mentioned in the store page, but the game itself is surprisingly fun. Let me elaborate:It's not Game Dev Tycoon, which (to my knowledge) is the newest of game developer simulation games, and they aren't that similar either. Sure they share a theme, but the gameplay is different. In Game Tycoon, you can acquire licenses, you have to print the games yourself, choose what goodies to include in the packaging, advertise your games, see the reviews (they have pics too, though there should be more variables among them) and all that.The graphics are cartoony and do their job, and there is voice acting (few lines here and there, nothing major). Music is a bit repetitive, but then again it's a simulation game aimed for niche market.The only major problem I have is that it tends to crash on my system, and when it does it deletes my saves. I am not certain if this is a common problem, or just my machine.I like this game and do not regret getting it.			"

												After playing this for roughly 20 minutes after seeing the corrected update online, a have to say I'm starting to like this better than Game Dev Tycoon. I mean yeah, GDT looks better and has streamlined flash-level graphics, but it's also simpler. GT 1.5 seems to be more detail oriented and gives, what I assume,  a more plausble notion of realism to the type of industry this game imitates(i.e. traveling around, the hiring factor, bank loans, etc.).Also, honestly, the people up in arms this being a copy of GDT or Game Dev Story need to try coming up with lives and then coming up with their own Game Development Sim and try to make something complete opposite of what's already been done. Seriously.Liked it, planning on playing more of it later			"

												Game Tycoon 1.5 is a rerelease of Game Tycoon, a game-building simulator published and widely-criticized in 2006. While Sunlight Games certainly had the opportunity to capitalize on the growth of interest in the genre in more recent years and fix the game, playing Game Tycoon 1.5 is a frustrating experience and one has to wonder why Sunlight Games did not simply start from scratch.The visual aspects of the game fluctuate between ""passable for a low-budget PC game developed a decade ago"" and downright laughable. In some parts of the game, text is pre-rendered as graphics. In other parts of the game, text consists of blue Times New Roman on a white screen. Think hyperlinks on the most basic webpages out of the early 2000s. The music is similar; some is passable, but some borders on the absurd. One track of the game is a six-second loop, but it doesn't loop properly. There is a delay between each loop, breaking any possible sense of immersion. It's like a bad Vine.The functionality is, of course, entirely broken. A tooltip will demand that you name your engine even after a name is provided. Buttons and boxes will not work, and progressing in the game requires a lot of rebooting, backing out of menu and, perhaps for some, copious amounts of praying. Easily, however, the worst aspect of this game is its ridiculous mechanics. There are many different actions that the player may take to fund or advertise their game, develop it, recruit staff and so on, more, than one might even expect from a low-budget game. Unfortunately, most time spent in this game will consist of your character walking between the advertising agencies, the university, the bank and so on because yes, that is how this game is played. You do not navigate menus, you walk slowly in a psuedo-3D world in order to get to where you need to go. It is tedious and, miraculously, it manages to be worse than any escort mission because it serves zero purpose.I know of four games in the game-building genre and this, as a game that isn't even in early access, is by far the worst. Your other options include Game Dev Tycoon and Mad Games Tycoon on the PC and Game Dev Story (personal favorite) on mobile devices. All of these games look, sound and play better than Game Tycoon 1.5, and you would be far better off to save yourself from the circle of hell that is Game Tycoon 1.5. Even if you get it in a bundle, don’t bother. It lacks any redeeming quality and ought to have been forgotten a decade ago.			"

												It's really, really bad.   I wouldn't mind the character spending a lot of time walking back and forth between buildings if there was actually something to design in each location.   It really is just a drag and drop game.   The game is broken up into chapters with an objective style of play, rather than one long career mode.   Essentially you start over each time.  I could only get through the first two before I completely lost interest in the gameplay.The gameplay is centered upon developing a game in a specific genre and hitting a specific percentage point to satisfy the publisher.   No real way to improve quality if you don't hit the mark.   Never take a publishing contract unless you are certain you'll exceed the expectations.   No subtitles!    I usually play with the sound off.   So there were many critical parts of the game where it was impossible to continue without audio instruction.Do not buy this.  Go buy ""Game Dev Tycoon"" instead.  This is an old game that is just being re-released to attempt to cash in on Game Dev Tycoon's success.			"

												I want to start by saying that at some point I hope to be able to create games. I love the idea of game studio simulation games and I really wanted to like this one. I read the mostly negative reviews and I avoided this one for a while, then I picked up a bundle of games and this one was part of it. My biggest complaint is that it seems unfinished. It's glitchy, it's not intuitive, and even on easy it's hard as heck to get anywhere with it. The tutorial is ok but has a bad habit of repeating what it says. If you have the music turned on forget it, you won't even be able to understand what the character is saying. The game itself is a great concept but I couldn't figure out how to make a profit much less make a ""quality"" game. During my short time with the game I had to start over about 6 times on the TUTORIAL alone! No, sadly, I cannot recommend this game. I think this will be the first game I actually HIDE in my library. I really hoped the reviews were wrong but they are spot on and if you are even thinking of buying this game, read them and HEED THEM!I hope if I do eventually get to the point of making or releasing anything game related that I do a better job than this.
