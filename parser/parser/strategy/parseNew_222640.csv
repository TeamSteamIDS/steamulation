												Great game. I give it 8/10.Pros: -Puzzles to unlock goodies on about every level-Awesome puzzles to complete storyline-Good storyline-Combat is intriguing and makes you think--must be very strategic.-The number of companions that you can control and deck out with gear-Pausing the game to plan out strategies-Talent trees to cutomize for each companion; it adds a deeper level of gameplay-Decent graphicsCons:-Game has some bugs--sometimes the abilities for a companion will not show up. Or, when you click on a companion, another companion's abilities show up. When this happens, you have to restart the game to fix. ...So, because of this, you need to remember to save the game after every battle!! -Gear is simplistic--it doesn't seem to have gear specific to any one character, it doesnt change the look of your character, and it does not change or add abilities to any character. Basically. gear just adds passive stats.-No end game. When you beat it, that's it. No unlocking of ubber mode, or anything, to find better gear for your characters. So, you can't really do anything else with the characters you have leveled up and decked out...not even restart and play the game again with your decked out characters.Pro or Con?-Easy to cheat to get gear. Just stand in front of a treasure box before you open it and save. If you don't like what you get, just load that save point and try again. You can do this when creating loot, too. -Right before you beat the game, the storyline takes a drastic turn and ends, leaving you hanging.What I would like to see in DLC or part 2 if they choose to make it, which devs should: -Instead of still pausing, make it to where everything is in slowmo when you hit what is now the pause key. -better gear-some end game-more challenges and hidden treasure-more bossesTips if you decide to buy:-Save Frequently-Wendaroo is freaking awesome, so learn how to use her.-Save before opening chests so you can reload last save if you don't like what you get.-When creating loot, the last item is the item you will create.. it could've been my imagination, though, but it usually also had the last attribute of that item put into it too.-Go for one target at first--usually the squishy magic type, like priests or mages. If you can't demolish it in 5 seconds,  split your damage amongst other targets...usually I tried demolishing one fast. But when that didn't work, I usually split dmg across two targets  in two seperate areas until one or the other was very low hp and then switched to full focus dmg on that one. This also helped me metigate inc damage better because I could see everything that was going on better so I knew who to heal and dispel and such.			"

												Aarklash Legacy is a highly tactical RPG set in the world of Aarklash and based on the desktop miniature game Confrontation.  While not a direct sequel by any means, it is set in the same world as the handily named Confrontation, a far inferior game,  also from Cyanide Studios.You play as a group of Wheelswords, the debt collectors of the Gold Mongers guild, the group that funds the armies of the ever warring races in Aarklash.  Your initial 4 person group is quite the motley lot, a part mechanical lizard with self confidence issues, a dog-monster, a tiny rat-like man and the standard fantasy trope of a sorceress in skin tight revealing clothing.  While the player doesn't have a customisable avatar of their own, it becomes clearer as the story goes that one of the starting four serves as the POV character.  Over the course of the game you'll meet 4 more characters that can be swapped in at any time for a maximum of 4 in the party.  All the characters are interesting and frequently talk among themselves and the game itself is fully voice acted very well.Where the game really shines is the isometric real-time with pause combat.  The standard MMO trinity applies here, with a tank to hold and collect as many mobs up as possible and hopefully orient them away from the squishier party members and 3 support or damage dealers.  Each character is limited to only four abilities and an auto-attack.  While this might seem limiting at first all the abilities can be significantly changed as you level up and with the ability to respec at will you can tailor your group to each individual fight.  Positioning is vitally important here, many of your parties abilities are line of sight.  There is nothing more annoying than firing off a healing disk and having an enemy walk in between and get healed instead!  All enemies and bosses have there own set of abilities that can be viewed at any time and you should ignore these at your peril.  Enemies come in many types, tanks who self-heal and can resurrect themselves, healers, debuffers, melee, ranges, summoners and many more.  While bosses come with own set of difficulties, many have insta-kill abilities like stay too close and you die, stay too far away and you die or don't stand here and you die.  You'll die a lot but all these abilities are telegraphed well!   Buffing and debuffing also plays a vital role in the game.  A favourite trick of enemy casters is to immediately turn off your group members most vital abilities but luckily some of your other characters are able to strip debuffs off one member and apply them to themselves.  Enemies will also constantly control your characters and many fights do degenerate into battling a series of buffs and debuffs with the first few seconds of any fight being the most important.  Though one criticism might be once you break the back of an enemy group, it can become a bit of a grind to finish a group off with no real threat.As opposed to the combat this is not a gear heavy game though, each character only has 4 slots, relic, ring, necklace and earring and you can't change armor or weapons or make any visual change to the characters.  There are also no merchants in the game, just a recycling mechanic where once you put in enough items in you'll get a high quality item back.The game also contains a heavy puzzle element outside of the combat.   From the standard lights out puzzles, though on a grand scale, to match the floaty magic symbol with various parts made up from lever pulls to guide the light through a maze.  At times the number of puzzles in a row can overwhelm, you can bypass some of them, but you might miss out on some of the best loot!This game is very demanding of the player, asking of exact positioning, use of all your various abilities and strategies and punishing of mistakes.  The difficulty is also set very high, it's not easy, medium, hard, it's more on the Super Hexagon Scale, hard, harder and harderest!  Though I think the latest patch may have toned the difficulty down a little bit.  But, don't let that scare you off as you'll miss one of the best tactical RPGs in years!9.5/10			"

												Aarklash is for people who like real time with pause tactical RPGs that are extremely challenging. If that is your thing, you will love it. I am not one of those people, but I know a well-crafted game when I see it.			"

												Story is intriguing in the beginning, dulls after a while. Puzzles are kind of annoying in this game. Loot does not reflect on your characters looks, and loot is basically just stat upgrades.HOWEVER, Gameplay is SOLID. Very fun. Very tactical. Has a tactical pause system and making a wrong decision in battle wether that be your positioning or focusing the wrong guy first or missing an ability timing... can kill you. The cons mentioned up above are annoying yeah, but overall in a game like this , the gameplay is the most important part to me. I bought it at full price and was pleased with my experience. If you're not sure, wait for a sale and then DEFINITELY pick it up. Each character has 4 main abilities. As you level up characters in the game, you can allocate stat points into these abilities. Each ability has a tree that branches out into different paths. You can basically max two of any of the eight branches on each character, thus customizing their playstyle. You can have a mage healer, or they can be a damage dealer or a mix. You can implant a seed that will explode if you kill the enemy within x number of seconds, and the explosion can do a heal AOE to teammates caught within range of said explosion, or you can max a completely different ability. There end up being eight playable characters, and you make a party of four. You choose the four. Seriously, the gameplay styles are really left in your hands with how you want to play the game. Very wise on the devs part. These are the reasons the gameplay is so satisfying. When all the abilities in your party go off just right and you completely wreck a mob... it feels pretty good.			"

												One of the best games I have played in a long time. Challenging, engaging, beautiful and a little retro. And the best part.. cheap.Aarklash isn't very deep in terms of RPG elements (though they are there, in a skill tree/limited inventory kind of way) but it is extremely deep in terms of gameplay. This is the first game in a long time where I relished the rematch after I was utterly destroyed.  Battles take place in real time, but you can pause at any time to chain orders. You can also remap your skill tree before a battle at no cost, so if at first you don't obiliterate - recalibrate, recalibrate again.The downside, and the reason I stopped playing in the end game, are the puzzles. At first the game reminded me of ""The Summoning"" where battles were intermixed with puzzles. But in the second act I was starting to get annoyed, and by the third act I had had enough. It just grinds the pace down to fight, puzzle, puzzle, fight, puzzle. And the puzzles aren't even interesting! They are rehashes of the earlier ones, with stupid terms and well...The upside is the fist half of the game, the pacing is spot-on, the graphics are sweet and like i said, the battles are the kind of thing that you walk away from a loss intrigued and not frustrated. You can constantly employ different teams and different skill sets, which leads to a depth not really seen in many games. I just wish they had spent more time developing the puzzles, instead of copy-pasting them at greater frequency. All scores out of 10, with 7 the highest:Graphics: 7Sound: 7Depth: 7Retro: 7Puzzles: 1End game: 4RPG: 5Strategy: 7			"

												Aarklash: Legacy is a squad based strategy game developed by Cyanide, releasing in September 2013 as a PC exclusive. Game play focuses primarily on a group of four characters, each of the characters have their own designated role within a group, such as tanking, healing and damage dealing. You will unlock more characters by progressing through the story mode however you can only have four characters in your group at any one time, meaning squad management plays a key role in success. Whilst each of the characters have their own primary role, there is some overlap with a few abilities, such as damage dealers may also have a healing spell to help out if needed, and healers will also have damage dealing spells. All characters have an “auto attack” which means your healers are still important when it comes down to burning enemies quickly.  Whilst the gameplay is mostly played in real time, the pause mechanic allows you to break from the mayhem in the fight to plan out your next wave of attacks and precisely move your group members around the battlefield. Whilst this is a nice addition, I didn’t find that much use for it, as I was able to do a lot of my commands in real time. What I did like however was how the game automatically pauses for you the moment you enter a battle, meaning you can get your initial abilities queued up to take a big advantage over your foes.  Looting in Aarklash is pretty neat too; there are only four item slots per character, necklace, rings, pendants and trinkets. Most enemies will drop loot, as well as finding it in treasure chests across the world too. Any loot which you have no use for, you can disenchant to create an epic quality item; this was a really nice way of dealing with unwanted or old equipment rather than just selling it to a vendor. It helped keep inventory space clear and your characters always had access to better equipment even if you weren’t lucky on the loot drops. The talent system through levelling up the characters is quite in-depth. Each character has four abilities as well as their auto attack. You are able to enhance the four abilities through a talent tree, which manipulates how the ability works, adding an additional effect, or just straight up increasing the amount of damage, healing or stats the abilities does. As with other talent systems in games, this allows you to mould your characters exactly how you want to fit in with the rest of your groups’ dynamics, allowing for some interesting hybrid characters to be built. One of my biggest negatives with Aarklash is the lack of any real checkpoint system. The game does offer unlimited quick saves, but if you are like me, you will often forget to save after large portions of game play and when you die, well…you are smack bang at the start of the level again, leaving you deflated and disillusioned at the thought of having to replay the past half an hours’ worth of battles.  Yes this issue can easily be fixed by the player and remembering to save, but there are enough cut scenes in the game that could easily act as a saving point for the level which would solve the games biggest flaw. Graphically, Aarklash is gorgeous.  This game could quite easily pass as a recently released title due to the high graphical fidelity on show.  All the main character models are all extremely high quality, and enemy models are slightly lower in quality but still look decent enough given the rest of the games high quality textures.  The game’s UI is OK to navigate, however a scaling of the UI also gets effected dramatically with the resolution you are playing in, meaning I was playing in 4K, so my UI was extremely small and I had to resort to getting uncomfortably close to my screen to even be able to read the text. I played Aarklash on the medium difficulty, and was happy with the challenges presented to me. A lot of people have commented on the community forums that they are finding even easy mode hard, but I feel as long as you take your time to build your characters properly, and equip them with the correct loot, then you shouldn’t have any problems, and even if you still do run into issues then you can just make full use of the in game pause mechanic to plan out your every attack since well…that’s what the feature is there for.  Upon completing the game, you will unlock the Rag’Narok difficulty level which you can probably guess, ramps up the difficulty to deathly levels and only should be taken on by hard core players. Each of the game’s chapters is split into a handful of smaller levels; some of the levels will merely be a case of working your way around the map and killing any of the foes you come across in order to find the exit. Others will include some quite interesting puzzles for you to master. None of the puzzles are mindboggling difficult to figure out, some require a little bit of thought, whilst others rely on your reaction times by moving characters across the map avoiding obstacles.  I thought the addition of the puzzles broke up the fighting sections of the game quite nicely and gave you a chance to experience something different. I finished Aarklash: Legacy in just under 7 hours. I do feel there is a good portion of replay ability on offer though; given the fact you can either ramp up the difficulty for a second play through, or even just using different characters throughout the story mode to give you a different game play experience. Apart from the UI scaling issue when it comes to higher resolutions, the other technical problem I encountered was very long loading times; almost to the point of me thinking the game had crashed. I was playing the game being installed on a regular HDD rather than an SSD but I have no loading problems on much more demanding games on a regular HDD, so there is clearly an optimization problem here. Thankfully there aren’t too many loading screens to deal with so this issue can be easily overlooked. Aarklash: Legacy was a sparkling gem in the rough for me. I didn’t expect much going into it, but was pleasantly surprised with the quality of game play and impressive graphics on show. It felt very much like a top down version of World of Warcraft with the different class roles, talent system and looting mechanics on offer.  The medium length campaign mode could be classed as being on the short side, but given the high production values on show, I would highly recommend people not take that into too much consideration. The price of £14,99 may be a little on the steep side for people on the fence about this game, but I would definitely recommend tactical minded people to pick up Aarklash: Legacy.

												6.5/10Fun game with significant flaws.  A lot of people compare it with Baldur's Gate but it has more in common with Freedom Force and other tactical games with ""less RPG"" and more ""tactics"" due a heavy emphasis on micromanagement and less so on itemization and characterization.  Character customization is fun but fairly linear and you can respec your characters outside of combat at any time.  Battles can be fun and difficulty is somewhat high by today's standards.  Graphics are pretty good.Some may enjoy the puzzles in this game and range from condescendingly easy to slightly annoying but solvable.  I feel that they are a detriment because they're too easy for fans of puzzle solving and annoying to fans of pure micromanagement.  The story is largely ignorable and the voice acting is mostly very bad.  There's a lot of poor grammar within the tooltips and the dialogue.   The item system is one of the worst I've seen in a game.  You can outfit your characters with various trinkets and jewelery for small stat increases, but progression is mostly very flat.  It's fun in games like Baldur's Gate to find various weapons with neat mods but in this game it begins to feel like a chore to make sure your healer upgrades his ""+5% healing done"" trinket to ""7% healing done.""  There's certainly no meaningful customization to be done with the items either because the mods are so linear, so they would have been better off not having items in the first place a la Freedom Force.The game is pretty short, but if it were any longer it would get repetitive.  I wouldn't pay full price for it.In short:THE GOOD:-Challenging tactical ""RPG"" that demeands significant micromanagement-Simple, but effective customization of character trees allows for a decent variety of gameplay options-The game knows its audience and doesn't cram storyline down your throatTHE BAD:-Tooltips and dialogue lack polish-Poor storyline, weak voice acting-Itemization is weak-Relatively short game-Puzzles often feel more annoying than thought provokingOverall, it's a decent game for the right gamer, but I wouldn't pay full price for it.

												I highly recommend this! From start to finish the combat is very engaging and has a great level of difficulty in terms of challenge and balancing from normal to hard difficulties. There is a good range of different combinations with party members and talent trees so don't get too distracted by the equipment load out which is not as extensive as other RPG's, this game is honestly just very solid gameplay wise.The visuals are lovely, there is a decent single player story to go through and then throw in a bunch of hidden areas with some puzzle sections and you may experience one of the more satisfying games in a while!I also recommend checking out a YouTube channel by Force Strategy Gaming for a nice overview of the game in action.

												Aarklash: Legacy is a RTWP (Real time with pause) game. While it does not have the story that a Baldur's Gate (or Pillars of Eternity) has, it shines in its - Characters: distinct abilities, well-defined characters- Graphics: Nicely drawn- Tactical gameplay: In the best traditions of Icewind Dale. The fights require thought, and synergy in abilities in your characters, where the next point is important.......- Strategic gameplay: Redo your choices in the skill tree anytime, choose among the available characters- Polish: Free from bugs- Difficulty Levels:  The game is best appreciated on the harder difficulty levels, making you improve your strategies, and sometimes play through multiple times. However, there are four levels of difficulty, including on the fly changes that are particularly useful to get you through a hard fight.- Pricing: Far less than a Pillars of Eternity, particularly when its on saleCons:- Story is trivial, focus is on the fights- Voice acting is a boreSummary:This game really should have done better than it has.

												Aarklash: Legacy is a great game. When I first bought it, the voice acting, dialogue, and poorly written skill descriptions (there are a lot of them) scared me away.  Everything else about this game brought me back in.During the first few fights of the game the pause function seems really gimicky. But it quickly makes this game playable, and interesting. Because you can take your time, learning everything about a fight and making the best reactions, the games dificulty rapidly increases, making some fights brutal, but ultimately fair. If you like killing stuff just cause, learing and adapting, character advancement and sweet, sweet loot, then ready your credit card. Be prepared to skip some awkward cutscenes and disable the onscreen tutorials.			"

												This is definitely one of those diamonds in the rough kind of games. The strategic gameplay is amazing. Timing, targeting, and positioning is very important. First the bad. There are definitely some aspects of this game that I wouldn't recommend. The storyline is decent, kinda your very overdone basic story though. Voice acting doesn't always match the dialoge text. The gear you get in the game is just RNG crap. 95% of the time you will get items that do not have the specific stats you want.The good. Graphics are well done. The pause/assign gameplay is like Dragon Age, except the fact it is done wonderfully and is pretty much required to do well. The skills and skill tree are very unique, making each character add an interesting element to the game. You must read and understand your enemies to know which to target, and which you can counter. Excellent game. Maybe not a box office hit, but it is unique and inspiring. Makes you wish there was a sequel, or another game more like it.			"

												Bought it , played it, beat it. Increasingly rare for me to say this these days, but this was a hidden gem that many will sleep on. Most will probably try to compare it to something like Balder's Gate/Dragon Age but it's more like Diablo where you control 4 people and can control then entire party. You can pause it and q up a whole string of commands and you will have to. This game is about combat and puzzles, more than NPC blah blah and that was a welcome mat for me, though the story wasn't terrible and the ending wasn't half bad. Only gripe is the game started out hard as nails and around the middle of the second Act it seemed impossible at times, then Act3 got steamrolled and I one shot the final boss... still though for 20 bucks or even waiting for a sale, is a steal for something like this. Was a really high quality game despite one crash, and a few niggles with pathfinding here and there. Given there's just not enough games like this, very easy to overlook. Hope for an expansion or even a sequel.			"

												Cyanide doesn't have the best track record when it comes to games, on this one though they have managed to pull ahead of the pack in some areas while falling far behind in others. With Aarklash Legacy they manage to provide an amazing tactical rpg experience at pretty much the cost of all other areas of the game. Real Time w/ Pause (RTwP) combat is where it shines and it is certainly the best isometric rtwp we've had recently.I have read some stuff about people not liking the puzzles in the game, I found them fine. I enjoyed most of them and it was a nice change of flow to the endless barrage of fights.The characters have lots of interesting attributes, E.G. the healer not able to regen mana, she has to feast on allies' hp to gain mana back. This skill can be upgraded so that the ally has buffs when feasted upon and even regenerates more than was feasted. Lots of tactical combat, having to carefully position your characters to avoid friendly fire and it manages it well. Rarely did I have an ally running into friendly fire unintentionally.What it sacrifices is pretty much everything else, lackluster story, mediocre progression, (You max out your chars about halfway through the game,) sub-par to average voice acting, An item system that just seems tagged on, and very little immersion.The game itself is pretty much a series of combats, you know that around every corner will be assorted bad guys and the plot comes up with a decent explanation for having skeletons fighting alongside humans, demons, angels, elementals, etc. If you enjoy RTwP tactical rpgs, then this shouldn't be a drag considering how well done it is. I was totally fine with it until about 3/4ths through the game, when there was no more character progression, all chars maxed out in levels, pretty much nowhere to go there. Just keep killing monsters at every bend in the path.tl;dr Buy it on sale if you're a fan of the RTwP tactical rpg genre			"

												Great title, considering the price. It's sort of like Diablo and a turn-based squad game had a baby -- Active pause lets you give orders to your squad of adventurers, and then things unfold in real time. Pros: 1. GREAT atmosphere and novel setting. The STORY itself could be a bit more polished, but the characters have personality and variety. I thought not being able to create your own character (you choose from pregens) would be an obstacle but it's NOT, the players are likable and learning their story is interesting.2. Novel random look system -- there are no weapons and armor to gather but instead a variety of jewelry you choose for each character. Not the deepest loot system, but I enjoyed it and found it sufficient. 3. Game is challenging and requires REAL strategy. The key to the game is developing your characters abilities to complement each other. You both need things like tanks, healers, and glass cannons AS WELL as characters who's abilities interact in different, and sometimes surprising ways. 4. OPTIONS with your characters. There are eight different characters and they all play differently and synergize with each other in different ways. There is a combination that will be a favorite for anybody, from the most conventional hack and slasher to the most devious min-maxer. 5. Combat is fun, challenging, and interesting. you have to leverage your own abilities as well as deal with the abilities of your opponents - either locking down their skills, stealing them, or dodging them. Likewise you must counter the enemies attempts to do the same.6. Game is hard enough on normal difficulty but upper difficulties should be challenging to the best strat-rpg'er... and if you like the game enough for a second play-through it promises to remain a challenge.7. There is plenty of game here. Although quite linear, I've put much time into it and only now have gotten to the third act -- which may or may not be the final one.8. You can enjoy it in small installments. do a couple of combats in 15-30 minutes, play something else, or slog through it. I've done a bit of both and it's good to have a game that doesn't require a big time commitment to enjoy.Cons:1. As I said, it's quite linear. Nothing resembling an open world here, and not much fork in the road either. Still, the ride is scenic and pleasurable, even if it is on rails.2. Loot could use more variety, though it IS interesting enough to require you to make choices and move things around.3. As I said, the SETTING is great, but the story is not as great as the characters and world are. I have gone quite far and I know a lot more about the factions in the world than anything meaningful going on between them. And the main bad guy is bad. To nobody's surprise.All told, I recommend this game -- and can honestly say I'd already be up for a sequel if it ever came out. It does the trick.			"

												If i told you i know of an RPG that is not open world, has minimal customization, no quests page, no point distribution, and a limited skill tree would you be intrested? If you said no then you may be missing out one of the best tactical RPGs of the last couple of years. Aaklash Legacy is abut one thing and one thing only, combat. You can set it up as you like(Pause anytime, or RTS), but in order to survive you will have to plan every encounter perfectly becasue the game is brutal even on normal difficulty.

												After completing this game on the highest difficulty setting, I can't really recommend Aarklash. Yeah, I've completed it and it ain't really that bad. But there are too many things wrong with the game for me to recommend it.The bad:- The puzzles are stupid and unnecessary. I like puzzle games, but not the way Aarklash did it.- The final fight is boring, easy, uninspiring and unfinished. It just ends without explaining anything. Maybe a buildup for a sequel?- The path finding is abysmal. A personal annoyance... Your party is running into each other or getting stuck around corners.- The equipment is limited and doesn't really add much to the game.- The skills are unbalanced from underpowered to overpowered.- BUGS: spells not casting or not working properly, the party leader suddenly switching, etc...Not necessarily a bad thing, but just to note:- The game is extremely linear; no exploration.- There is only fighting and more fighting with a (horrible) puzzle thrown into the mix.A few good things:- I did like the different personalities of the party and the voice acting was decent.- The graphics and atmosphere are okay.- The game was somewhat challenging (on the highest difficulty, at least).

												Very solid squad based RPG... The story is half decent, the background locations are gorgeous, and the fighting is pretty good. Also it is more or less indie game and the price tag is a comfortably low and likely to get lower during specials. Can't lose if you get this if you are an RPG fan, especially if it is on sale...

												I bought this game for $1.99. I didn't expect all that much from it but I was pretty surprised. The story was a pretty unique one in that you aren't a typical ""good guy"" but you belong to a group that is sort of grey area.The story is good and the combat is fun. Give this a shot.Just...turn off the voice audio. The dialogue text is good enough. The voice acting in this is pretty cheesy.			"

												Nice little tactical rpg so far. Unique skills that have strengths and weaknesses that make you think not just click. Characters are interesting, skills are interesting. Pretty linear for an rpg. Story is generic, but the gameplay is solid. 6/10.EDIT: While writing this review and my characters were standing still, Denzil says while waiting ""So THIS is tactical in a tactical rpg?"" 7/10 now.

												Aarklash is a combination of contemporary gameplay concepts packaged in a thoroughly enjoyable original game world.  The real-time tactical gameplay may be paused for strategy and intelligent action queuing at any time, akin to Bioware's Mass Effect or Dragon Age series.  This does a fine job of straddling the line between overwhelmingly reactionary (hardcore RTS) and drudgingly micromanagey (omg stahp, Sid Meier) to land in a comfortable sweet spot.Core character roles are all familiar and easy to spot, ie DPS, Tank, Support, and perhaps overly so.  While you can re-spec skill points any time you aren't in combat and sans penalty, nothing will change the pigeonholed duties of any single character.  Different characters do, however, provide equally different approaches to those roles.  Your high-armor taunty starting tank feels utterly different from the high-HP drainy tank introduced later.  Your AoE stun battlefield mage DPS is wholly unique from the fear kiting AoE burst damage lich DPS.  Skill points can dramatically change the implementation of a skill.  One skill tree path alters a targeted taunt into an aggro-stacking aura, as an example.  Balance is maintained well enough that I never found myself forced into a specific team for pure efficacy, and I appreciated that, too.Aarklash's (Aardvarks?) visuals and style are also quite original.  The graphics avoid eye bleedingly generic, but never so artsy or stylized that anything becomes abstract.  The audio always feels appropriate and organic, managing to be pleasant without standing out in most cases.  I never had any ""just walked into Gestahl's Magitech facility"" moments, here.Most characters deserve genuine emotional investment.  Dialog (with decent voice acting) and individual foibles are believable as well as interesting.  The giant, ruthless, kangaroo/lizard-booty'd, test-tube grown, magical cyborg miner-slave-become-indentured-bounty-hunter, armored tank girl just happens to also be everyone's sweet, caring, occasionally naive, gentle voiced, younger ""sister"" stand-in and I never questioned it once.  The people on both sides of the over-arching power struggle had no clear moral high ground.  Your heros and their guildmates are emphatically not ""good"" people but neither are they evil.  Their motives are usually easily understood but subjective morality is a significant factor for precisely nobody.  Both protagonists and antagonists are driven by a combination of geas'd contracts, pseudofamilial loyalties, and outright selfishness. The story was quirky, unless the last paragraph didn't make that obvious, but ultimately disposable.  The developer did a great deal of world building and complex background development... then slapped a generic ""run from the crooked law and find the macguffin"" Hollywood plot on top.  There was not a great deal of character growth either, which I felt was a real shame.I had a lot of fun playing the game and would cheerfully play it again were an iota of reason to do so present.  The downside from the flexibility of free skill respecs lies in there being no real point to starting over to see how a totally different build would handle the game's events.  Equipment is just random stacks of minor stat boosts, rarer items simply having more picks from the general pool of boosts and higher levels providing slightly less minor boosts.  There's no real grinding, collecting, or optimization to be had here by the hardcore gamer.Aarklash: Legacy seems to have suffered from a lot of player butt-hurt stemming from a steep difficulty curve.  The game is challenging in the classic sense.  That said, nearly every party wipe I experienced was perfectly preventable without any foreknowledge if I'd more closely observed enemy stat boxes and spell countdowns.  The gameplay tutorial even stresses that the player must be attentive to these resources.  I felt combat was entirely fair with reasonable demands on my decidedly average skill level.  The game is first and foremost a squad-based strategy RPG.  If you go into it expecting a pick-up-and-master casual or arcade game you're going to be brutallized, and deserve it.  I felt it was slightly more forgiving than Final Fantasy Tictacs (PSX), if simply for the fact that the most devastating boss actions are interruptable or redirectable while mid-cast.Overall, I'd have to give the game a 7.5 out of 10.  The minimal replay value and disappointing story were the only serious downsides.  The musical score, while inoffensive, was also inconsequential.  Where Aarklash really shines is in the moment; during a dicy moment in combat or affectionate banter between morally ambiguous guildmates, the time just flies by.			"

												This game is pretty cool, and would be perfect, but is lacking in a few minor details.  The game mechanics are solid, the skill tree is pretty cool for each character, and you are not locked into the tree, can reset it for free.   The combat is very much position based, adding a lot of possibilities to each fight, especially when you add in the skill trees.  Want a healer that also damages units the heal passes through, well then choose that path down the skill tree.  Pretty neat combinations and possibilities.  The characters are interesting, and so far the story is pretty good, and somewhat original.  The character Bio for each character is interesting, and hopefully the full story unlocks as the game is played. It has a few rough edges.  I don't like the map overview, it seems unfinished, static, and dead.  Finished a map, and really had no idea where to go, or for that matter what i was supposed to be doing, as I have not found a quest log either (don't think it exists?).  After beating the boss, and looking at the map a while, I finally chose to wander back towards the start of the map.  After a short time it did finally trigger a cut scene, and spared me the long walk back, but it just seemed a little rough around the edges.  It also hates the steam overlay on my computer, everytime I hit tab it pops open the overlay.  While chatting with friends, the text lags horribly.  So might want to turn it off. None of this really detracts from the game in anyway.   Having a lot of fun with this so far.  I would have to give it 8/10 so far.			"

												Have you ever heard of Aarklash: Legacy before? Probably not. Should you be playing Aarklash: Legacy? Well, let me put it this way: did you enjoy Icewind Dale or Dragon Age: Origins' frequent ""real time w/ pause"" combat? If the answers to these questions are ""Yes"" then Aarklash is for you!Not much of a story but one hell of an experience, Aarklash: Legacy presents challenging, exciting isometric RPG combat in a way that hasn't been seen for years. While essentially a linear slaughter from one story event to the next, Aarklash delivers it's frantic tactical battles wrapped in a beautiful aesthetic.This is the kind of game you buy not just to enjoy, but to also ensure the possibility of an even bigger sequel.

												Aarklash: Legacy is a fun game that can be challenging without being frustrating. Contrary to what some other reviewers mention the puzzles aren't that hard, though some do require some thinking. I never had to check online for solutions. But they do slow the gameplay down a bunch during Act2 and the later parts of Act 3 (there are 3 acts total). The combat is the true star of this game, If you liked the tactical aspects of combat in games like Baldur's Gate and Dragon Age: Origins, you'll have lots of fun figuring out how to approach the fights in this game.Worth a buy, but maybe not at full price. Wait for a special. I bought it during the winter sale at $12.99 and found it to be a good value at that price.			"

												Aarklash: Legacy has some appeal and the gameplay is solid. This game offers a unique way to battle. If you are a tactical player, I would recommend this to you. However, before you splurge your money on this, know that what this game is missing is substance. Think of it this way: an empty cup. There’s no water, juice, coffee, etc. All Aarklash Legacy has to offer is gameplay. Aside from the gameplay, the story gets dull really fast. At first, the story may seem appealing, but after a while, the boredom and annoyance will sweep in. Bundled with an underwhelming character cast and voices, Aarklash Legacy makes its a stressful effort to continue playing. Luckily, Aarklash Legacy is able to slightly redeemed itself with an innovative skill system. Each character has a choice between 4 skills and these skills gets more interesting around late game. Even though, it would be a challenge to continue playing that long, every choice made in the skills and how the characters are maneuvered in gameplay is crucial in succeeding in the battles. The story, voices, characters, and overall repetitious environment of Aarklash Legacy gets itself a big no.Rating: 5.2/10 (52%)Achievements: 8/29 (28%)Game Done.			"

												Aarklash: Legacy is a real-time-with-pause RPG where the story takes a backseat to tightly responsive, engaging combat, where your party can be swapped out at any time, and skills can be respecced at any time, leaving fights to always be intense and engaging, and can often feel more like puzzles to be approached from various angles, deciphering how to best synerrgize your heroes, and defeat enemies.There are no consumables, and party members rapidly heal to max after each combat, keeping the pace of the game quick and shuttling from fight to fight. A few puzzle sections break up combat, but for the most part, you quickly move from fight to fight, with small story cutscenes interspersed between.Some of the story concepts were interesting in their own right, and the characters, while sort of one dimensional, have interesting backgrounds and show pieces of deeper characterization that might come to the fore if the game were more story intensive. You catch bits and peices of story that are clearly meant to be travelled to and elaborated mor eon, in sequels that will never come, which i a real shame because the game is genuinely fun.Party set up is 4 characters out of 8, each character fitting into a particular role: Tank, physical damage, magical/CC, and Healer. You get 2 of each character and are forced to use every charatcer at leats once in the game due to a party split. The characters are all competent in their roles, but at the highest difficulty, there definitely seems like there would be a push to only use the most optimal party. The two tanks are divided between a more defensive and buff oriented tank, and a more offense and steroid oriented tank. The physical attackers are a ranged gun-dwarf that debuffs physical attacks, and a sly rogue goblin that inflicts massive critical damage, and blind and silences foes. The magical attackers are a classical sorceress, and a lich who debuffs, charms and controls enemies with hexes. The healers feel the most imbalanced in their abilities: One is a powerhouse healer that can eventually turn the entire part immune to damage for 5 seconds, and the other is an orc shaman who can invert his abilities for use on enemies, or buffs on allies. It's a neat idea, but in a combat game, very little trumps simply being able to be invincible for 5 seconds, on  a7 second cooldown.You can mix and match party members as you like, but the setup of the game very strongly encourages selecting one character from each role.Loot is passable ARPG fare and entirely random - items you don't want ca be junked into ameter that eventually spits out a ""Epic"" tier item, so recycling old items for new ones gives you new and better gear. None of it is super interesting - it's all just bigger number buffs on your stats, but it does the job.Would definitely recommend the game to anyone feeling that isometric combat game itch - it scratches it wonderfully, and while the story leaves you wanting more, the combat is fun enough to where you could eaisly pull 2 or 3 plays, if you wanted to beat higher difficulty levels, or experiment with other party configurations.

												TLDR: I'm loving Aarklash: Legacy and would highly recommend it. If you need a score... 8.5Pros: Innovative combat mechanics. A great story and interesting characters. Completely voiced campaign. Demo (with save transfer to main game).Cons: Limited visual options. Open-ish but sill fairly linear world. No character creation.I've been looking at Aarklash: Legacy off and on ever since it first came out but I just couldn't pull the trigger. It went on sale for $1.99 and still I tried the demo version first. I'm glad I did and oh what a surprisingly good game it turned out to be. The demo was interesting and entertaining while giving a good feel of what the main game would be. I was surprised to find that the demo save transfers over to the main game as well. So if you're interested just try the demo and see what you think. As for the game itself I'm only a few hours in right now and I'm loving it so far. Aarklash is essentially a Pause & Play strategy Action RPG. Think of the Pause & Play mechanics of Dragon Age mixed with the Isometric view and dungeon crawling of Diablo. The combat happens in real time but you can pause the game at any time to give your characters orders. Such as where to stand and what skills to use. Unpause the game and see how everything unfolds. There's also some puzzle solving elements both in the world and in the combat. Early in the game you can turn a group of statues a certain way and it spawns a mini boss. This mini boss summons a group of minions which attack you but also heal her as well. You can step in the way of her minions healing blasts and be healed instead. Cutting her off from her support and showing off one of the more interesting mechanics of the game. Line of sight. Many skills have a line of sight or fire. Not all but the ones that make sense. A fireball does because characters conjure it in their hands then blast it out in front of them. Allowing you to dodge it or possibly put your tank in the way to save your mage. Conversely a lightning strike comes from the sky so it hits an enemy directly. I know this may not sound all that impressive on it's own but in a large battle it can create some very hectic and interesting situations. Killing your own characters or healing an enemy can be frustrating but dodging an enemy attack and stealing their heals is incredibly satisfying. The story in Aarklash is interesting as well and so far it seems to be completely voiced. Not the greatest voice acting in the world but more than serviceable for sure. There's a solid and interesting skill tree system and you're able to put your junk items into the trash of course but after trashing so many items you get a randomly generated high tier item.It's not all rainbows and kittens sadly. The world has branching paths and hidden areas along the way but it's still fairly linear. You start with specific characters and though you get more characters to swap in and out later there isn't any kind of character creation. Atleast none that I've seen thus far. My biggest gripe with Aarklash isn't with the game itself but with the video options. There is a preset for quality, some resolution options and tick boxes for vsync and anti-aliasing. That's it. No shadow or detail options and nothing for ambient occlusion. No bloom, god ray or depth of field options and no sort of post processing settings at all. This drastically impacts scalability. It's not like AArklash takes a monster rig to run it but higher end PCs won't ""show the pretty"" and lower end machines won't be able to tweak to get a better fps. I'm not sure if there are any kind of ini tweaks for the game but if you run into any issues google is your friend. I will point out that the demo version is a great representation of the game. So if you have problems with the demo you'll have the same issues in the main game but if the demo runs like a charm for you then you'll be good to go with the main game as well. Good luck and have fun.			"

												I bought it on a whim based on some positive discussions I happened across on this form and was totally blown away with the story (not finished), the art, the mechanics, character progression, and the gameplay.You control a group of 4 characters that each have a very distinct ability set.  Each character has 4 basic abilities that can be leveled seperately and the choices are never easy and ofcourse lead to replayability.  The beauty of the system is that their ability is used most effectively when chaining off another character's ability which leads to very satisfying combos. The game is an RTS but with spacebar pause (you will spend a majority of your time paused).  Even as a dad, I enjoyed sharing this with my son where I could pause, and then illustrate the value of group dynamics and cool synergies that can exist within.Tactically, it's a treat with a lot to offer and the art style is simply stunning!  Although the game offers the player a wide array of options, it's presented in a beautiful interface that is easy and intuitive to nagivate.I simply love this title and hope it gets more attention so we can see more works of art like this in our space.

												Aarklash: Legacy is a fairly simple strategy RPG, but with no pretension to greatness, it offers a very satisfying, fast paced experience. The story, setting and characters aren't developed extremely well, but it's still interesting, despite the many typos, translation mistakes and predictability. The game offers you a good choice of character to use, and the battle system is centered around the 4 skills each characters can use. The key to mastering the battle system lies in the synergy between characters, your ability to time your skill usage properly and controlling the battlefield. It's fast paced, the challenge is generally high but fair and the game has no downtime. It's not fantastic, it doesn't offer a huge amount of depth, but it's still a really enjoyable game that is worth playing. Hopefully the devs come up with more and refine the formula.			"

												This is the only RTwP game I've ever played that had non-moronic, click-and-watch/wait combat.  This game is linear and not a true RPG, but has rpg elements such as character building and a real inventory and loot/item upgrading.  No chargen.  This is more of a linear story driven squad TBS or Tactics game (like FF tactics) except with RTwP combat.The strong point of this game is the combat.  Even though it is RT you NEED to micromanage, and the game makes it easy and not frustrating like it is with the IE games, NWN 2, or Drakensang where micromanaging is an exercise in frustration and futility.  A lot of bosses require a solid strategy to win.  The combat is done surprisingly well and I don't know why this game wasn't more of a hit.			"

												When I started playing 'Aarklash Legacy' I expected a top-down, iso perspective role playing game with my party experiencing adventures in a fantasy world similar to 'Baldurs Gate'. I soon had to find out that this is not the case. 'Aarklash Legacy' entirely emphasizes on fighting and not on role playing. And unless you set the difficulty to easy, every single fight is a tactical challenge. You have to correctly position your squad, use your attack, health, distract and support abilities wisely and individually adapt to each new group of enemies. Every fight means micro-management. It's the whole idea of this game and it's a matter of taste if you like this or not. I was annoyed by it in the beginning but enjoyed it at the end.Role-play is only a minor aspect of this game. You will not discover any cities, trade loot with traders or level up your characters by completing side quests. Nevertheless I recommend 'Aarklash Legacy'. If you have the patience to survive the first few hours of the game, you will start enjoying the tactical depth of the fights and appreciate the game for what it is.Pros:- beautiful graphics - interesting mix of eight different characters that you can freely combine in your four member squad- many very well balanced puzzles- character abilities can be upgraded by loot and level up- becomes addictive after a while- many different type of enemies- nice maps and settingsNeutral:- average story- average music Cons:- frustrating start of the game- very difficult unless you play on easy and even then it's not easy - tutorial is rather confusing than helpful- the game is rather short			"

												First off: This game misses a tag. PUZZLE GAME! You run into puzzles everywhere (They aren't too hard for me thankfully) and even some battles are small puzzles in which you have to read enemies abilities and then deduct the best order to kill them. Often it's something like raiser-healer-debuffer-bufffer-warriors and if you kill enemies in the wrong order they're raised or healed.Also, putting major spoilers in the load screen just before you reach that point in the story is not apprechiated by me. Not at all. Seriously. That's one of the silliest things I ever saw in a game so far.Otherwise the game is quite decent, skills are adequate, battles are fairly fast and furious, the game looks nice and runs smooth. No errors but I wouldn't expect those in a game released more then 2 years ago.There are some downsides to the game as well, equipment for one is abysmal with everyone being able to equip earrings, a ring, a relic and a necklace. All of those are randomly generated. Weapons and armor? Nah. Potions? Nuh uh.  Anything but the four afore mentioned items? Nup.Would I recommand the game?Yep. The game could have been better but it's quite a lot fun to play and that's what counts and makes me forgiving of little loot vareity, sillyness and even of PUZZLES. P.s. I wonder why this game has the rpg tag. I haven't been able to make a single choice in 8 hours that affected anything storywise. The game is entirely linear with smalls maps you can explore a little.			"

												Bought this for a couple of bucks, didn't expect much...surprised at how good this game actually is...Not your classic tactical RPG with an active pause (ie: BG,NWN,DA:O and the recent Pillars of Eternity & Sword Coast: Legends), since there is no character customization, no equipment except accessories (amulets, earings, rings etc.) that adds certain buffs - and afaik - no perishables like scrolls or potions.This is no Bauldar's Gate - But the game is good because it has no intention to be a Bauldar's Gate knock-off, it focuses in one area - combat.I find the combat quite satisfying because the enemies and your team of mercs have their weaknesses and strengths, and the AI does a great job in synergizing the group of enemies and reacts to your actions - I debuffed an enemy with a spell and he immidiately attacked the caster - that's good AI in my book.Other than that, music and graphics are really good - although the voice acting is crap.Story-wise, it's decent...nothing more, the bad voice acting & dialogues hinder your desire to care - which is a shame.TL;DRA combat focused tactical RPG, that excels in the combat section.8/10			"

												Aarklash: Legacy is a solid tactical RPG with quite a lot more depth than it initially seems to have.  The battle system is reminiscent of those of Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights, using a pausable real-time system that allows you to plan without ever getting bogged down.  The character roster seems somewhat limited (you can have four active characters, each with four abilities), but the number of ways to customize each character, and the ways in which you can combine them, give you a surprisingly huge number of options.  And if a character isn't pulling his weight, you can respec him whenever you want.Where the game really shines, however, is the tactical nature of its battles.  Simply standing around and hitting enemies with regular attacks is a good way to lose battles quickly.  Enemies have multiple abilities and will use them to full effect, and you need to do the same.  Heal injured characters, draw foes away from the more fragile members of your team, and pull your characters out of range when foes start charging up their big attacks - or just knock them down to disrupt their ability.Aarklash: Legacy isn't quite like any other game I've played, in a good way.  It's a refreshing tactical experience in which every victory feels earned.			"

												This is a fantastic game, I had a blast playing it and it challenged my tactical abilities quite a bit, even though I only played on regular difficulty.  Not sure if I'll be up to the challenge of Rag'narok difficulty, but I'm going to have to try!The setting is extremely unique, and while I was put off by the odd cast of characters initially, they quickly becamse extremely likeable and entertaining.  The voice acting in this game also stands out as being extremely good, and is a large part of why I enjoyed the story so much.My only recommendation to the developers is that there be more variety in the types of enemies encountered.  I would say that there were maybe 20 different types of enemies encountered throughout the game, and they usually come in packs of 4-7, so you will see the same enemies quite a bit.  That being said, the abilities possessed by the enemies are unique and give the game its challenge.  When you get your healer charmed and your tank frozen, you quickly realize you need to figure out who to target first, what preventative measures to take, and how to dodge projectiles.ProsEnjoyable level of difficulty.Variety of tactics to choose fromInteresting story with unique charactersGreat voice acting and prety visualsConsRepetive enemy encounters			"

												This game is boring.  Thats basically it.  After a while the game just gets dull and monotonous, it because more annoying than fun.  You don't get to customize your characters (though the character designs are pretty cool), and there are only earings, artifacts, and rings, which just improve stats, the models don't change at all.  So with this, (and some really meh voice acting) you don't really get attached to the characters.Other things that don't change: character abilities.  You like having four of the same abilities for each character for the entire game?  I don't.  On level up you can spend a point to make the ability cost less mana, or do more damage, or heal more, but at the end of the day they are the same.  Yawn.Also, some of the mechanics are just, well, kinda stupid.  You have a tank character that has to spend health to use abilities.  Your healer cannot regenerate mana and so has to steal it from your two other allies, a rogue and a mage, and they can get busted up really badly.  So all you are doing is just constantly healing your tank, juggling the health of your two other characters, and trying to keep the healer with enough mana.  At first this kind of sounds interesting, but after a while, and a lot of fighting, it just gets really, really annoying.Other people may have fun playing this, and it does have a good strategy game at it's core, its just too bland and boring for me, and annoying.  3/10			"

												I paid about $5 for this on sale, which is a fair value if you dislike the game and a steal if you enjoy it.This is a difficult game to review. If I could, I'd put this game into a neutral category. This is the kind of game that will polarize people into love or hate. I feel that a month or two of refinement, additional assets and play testing, could have elevated this game into something much greater than 7/10.The negatives, in order of what was most noticeable:- Each character has 4 skills to choose from. You only gain 1 skill point per level and most of the time, you will put the point into an existing skill. Therefore, for the first 10 levels, the skills don't tend to vary combat that much. This is boring. I never felt a sense of elation, that comes with leveling in MMO RPGs or single player RPGs.Although I like the branching nature of the skill tree ( which modifies the effect, of the skill slightly ), the lack of skills feels RPG-light compared to a conventional RPG where clerics and mages might have 6-9 different spells.Both your hero and skill points cap at level 20, which means that of the 4 skills, one was designed to be a dead end skill by the developers, since mathematically you will only have 1 default point in that particular skill. I'll give you a hint and say that some of the buffs and debuffs are a waste of casting time and mana, considering that the game focuses on DPS, stunlocking and healing.It costs 3 skill points to respec your skill tree, which is too expensive.Although I liked the strange, unique and avant-garde mechanics of the tank having to spend hit points, to perform skill actions, it does not work work very well for the first 5 levels, since she doesn't have a large enough health pool, to perform many actions. Similarly, the cleric does not regenerate mana and has to steal health from her companions, in order to generate magic points. She has to almost kill her companions, in order to heal them, which is amusing but likewise, doesn't really work for the first 5 levels or so ( this is a balance issue ). The amusing irony is that the mage ends up being the best, most versatile healer in the game.- The tactical combat side of the game is, for the most part, tedious. There are probably only around 20 different monsters to fight which is simply not enough for an action RPG game. This game would need, at a bare minimum 50 different monsters. Something on the scale of 100 different monsters, would drastically elevate this game. Compared to the Dungeons and Dragons monster manual, this game is sorely lacking!Combat consists of figuring out which opposing control wizard to stunlock, taking out the cleric and DPSing the enemy. Then you have to cross your fingers and hope that the RNG ( random number generator ) Gods are in your favour. Battles are usually a landslide, there are very few, close battles. You either efficiently dispatch the enemies or you unfortunately lose an ally, who ends up face down in the dirt and then you have to try and struggle to get a team-mate to revive him. The character doing the reviving will come under fire, which will delay the reviving, each time he takes a hit. I usually play games on the hardest difficulty levels but I had to set the difficulty to medium. The only difference is that on the harder difficulty levels, your allies will end up face down in the dirt, which increases the chances of a party wipe, then the game automatically ends and you have to reload the game and fight out the same battle. The harder difficulty levels are extraordinarily tedious and resemble the kind of grind in an MMO. Medium ( the default difficulty ) was too easy for me, so I never managed to find a happy equilibrium.- The environments for Act 1 and 2 were bland. Act 1, the wilderness was the worst and gave the false impression of open world exploration. Realistically, for the first 5-10 levels, there is a set path to follow, in terms of finding treasure chests and being able to fight monsters at the level you are at. The only way to figure out the path, is to take the wrong turn, wipe and reload. This is tedious. The game environment becomes almost completely linear in Act 2 and 3, which is the way that Act 1 should have been. I did like the art direction for Act 3.The positives:+ I immediately liked the characters, plot, voice acting and dialogue. These are the aspects of the game that kept me playing.+ I enjoyed the puzzles in Act 2 and Act 3. Each puzzle takes 5-10 minutes to figure out. If you don't like puzzle games then this game is not for you.+ The orchestrated music was appropriate.+ I enjoyed the part where you gained 4 additional characters and the game forced you to use them to explore. I wish that the game had had more of that.+ The combat and skill tree does get more varied and interesting around level 13 ( which is relatively late in the game ).Miscellaneous:Examples of ARPGs ( action role playing games ) that I would recommend: ""Freedom Force"" and the sequel, ""Freedom Force vs the 3rd Reich"". Both of those games were fantastic 9/10 for the first and 10/10 for the second.http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/340353-freedom-force/index.htmlhttp://www.gamerankings.com/pc/919085-freedom-force-vs-the-3rd-reich/index.html "

												I grabbed this game on sale, and it's been really enjoyable. I bought the game for the tactical combat which I read was good, and it really is. Though, it gets a bit boring towards the end, and the last fight is probably the simplest and dullest in the game.Other than the combat.. eh. I liked the characters, but the voiceovers were mediocre to awful. Plot doesn't really exist, and the loot is incredibly boring.Also the game did it's best to murder my GPU via overheat.

												Fast paced tactical RPG perfectly realised and priced. It's more hack 'n' slash than mainstream RPG and seems fairly linear but, perhaps surprisingly, this isn't so much of a bad thing. In fact it's fairly original in its approach and I would recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs but would also like to take a break from their sometimes long-winded adventuring with a more high octane game that isn't bogged down by self importance and  a large ammount of pointless grindy questing. 80%			"

												For some reason somewhat obscure tactical RPG. It's actually fun but only if you'll find the combat enjoyable, because it doesn't provide much outside of it. Some details below:StoryYou play as a group of misfits, who are magically bound to serve as debt collectors for Goldmonger guild. The cast has interesting characters, like by-the-book mage, insecure hybrid of a killing machine and a woman, some guy who promised to serve the guild so hard so he turned into lich after his death. Unfortunately the plot is very insipid with one cliche twist, there's very little character interaction and development and half of the cast has only token lines. Orc shaman has a few ""spirits this spirits that"" lines. Wendaroo, wolfen priestess, constantly complains about the smell and growls at things she doesn't understand.Overall it is the game's weakest point, it's not bad but I did not find it enjoyable either. A lot of wasted potential with the cast here.GameplayGameplay itself is fairly linear, you progress from area to area, clearing preset encounters and solving an occasional puzzle. There are some side branches and optional puzzles treasure chests. Puzzles are okay, leaning towards trivial side.Inventory system is rudimentary, since you can't have one-size-fits-all weapons and armor if your squad has an ogre with a club and a dwarf with musket, each character has 4 slots for magic jewelry. During the game you'll find a lot of those trinkets, and you can discard a bunch of unwanted gear and in return you'll get random highest quality gear.CombatCombat is in real time with active pause. You control 4 characters, and have 4 characters on a reserve bench. Between encounters you're free to swap characters, gear and respec abilities. Each character has only 4 abilities, but for each ability you have 2 perks/branch paths, that change the ability drastically. Levels are capped at 20, which means you get to choose 5 ""perks"" per character. Every character also has a quirk: ogre has a chance to miss his attack, lich has 0 physical armor, wolfen priestess can't regenerate mana and instead has to sap health from teammates.Game mechanics has a wide array of status effects (from invulnerability to turning healing into damage) and crowd control like stun, slow, fear, charm, knockdown, etc. Overall effects are very strong and you're expected to pay attention to them, dodge enemy abilities, cancel or counter nasty spells when possible, if you won't do that you'll either lose your party members fast or even accidentally kill your own party members with friendly fire. Because of this game might feel quite brutal even on medium difficulty, especially in the beginning. If one character gets downed, you have to help him before the bleedout timer runs out, otherwise the character dies and game ends.Encounters are pre-set, each encounter experiments with enemy setups, sometimes even sending backup from behind. Enemies vary from mages that take control over your squad members to knights that disable spellcasting for characters that stand near them. You get to fight a bunch of bosses too, most of them have unique attack patterns and abilities, like one hit KO.In general combat is fun, but some people might find the difficulty off-putting. It's pretty much mandatory to save between encounters (there is a quicksave button though).			"

												Excellent tactical RPG action. The fights are pleasingly balanced push/pull affairs that require you to press every advantage you can get to cross over the knife-edge to victory, and the variety of enemies and bosses are enough to keep things fresh for a long time. as is playing around with the various party arrangements. The hassle-free respeccing between fights lets you really get experimental with ways to counter your opponents.There are some alright non-combat puzzle elements there, and the story/voice acting is surprisingly enjoyable too, but the combat is the real gem of this game.As for downsides: The RPG elements are pretty basic, but it wears that on its sleve. And the item/trinket system isn't very interesting and can it get kind of annoying to trawl through all the junk loot for marginal stat improvments.			"

												Aarklash legacy is a really good group control game, reminiscent of the days of Baldur's Gate or Dragon Age gameplay wise. However it provides a really fair and immediate challenge if you allow it (play the hardest mode, it is really quite good). The game definitely focuses more on challenging gameplay than character customization/depth. The items you find are good, but not as drastic as those of a hack and slash game, so this isn't really a loot game.It reminded me of wow raiding a bit to be honest, except I had control over all the characters. The spell systems for the few casters that are in the game is pretty interesting and challenges you when trying to keep your characters healthy.Overall voice overs aren't too bad, the characters are kind of silly, but not completely uninteresting or anything. I do think that without the challenge this game would feel a little flat, so I would advise for you to make it as difficult as you can so you can enjoy getting past the puzzles that appear in the game (in the form of fights).

												This game is pretty bad.I'm sorry, there's no other way to say it.Let's start with the good stuff, since it's shorter. Graphics are good, the lore and the story are pretty nice too.That's it.The problem is the gaming factor. If this was a graphic adventure, a comic book, anything else, it would have been nice.Sadly, it's a GAME and the GAMING is plain bad.Irrelevant character progression, irrelevant equipment, irrelevant monsters.Everything is pretty hard, but not in a challenging way. The game punishes you for not pausing every second to use your party.And this is another relevant point: the AI.Simply out, your party isn't intelligent. They blindly do what you tell them to, with no initiative, so this quickly becomes a game of extreme micromanagement of EVERY SINGLE ACTION. Since you have to control 4 different PC, you can see where's the problem.I played Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate and the Temple of Elemental Evil, all tactical RPGs with big parties. I kinda know the genre. Aarklash isn't a fun example of this kind of games.			"

												Frigging brilliant game.The combat and skills seem a little shallow for the first dozen or so battles; tank and spank, only 4 skills per character, and the talent trees look very sparse. By the time your starting party memebers reach level 4 and have all their base skills unlocked you might feel like you've reached the end of their variability, and you would be wrong.The talent trees look sparse because, simply put, there is no fluff to be ignored, like so many other *cough* world of warcraft *cough wheeze* games. Every point in every tree is meaningful. Yes, even the ones that ""merely"" reduce a spells mana cost by 10% or increase a spells damage by 20%. Those small numbers matter in this game.Then there are the truly game changing options, like a curse that makes an enemy's incoming heals cause damage to them instead. It sounds like a parlor trick or a gimmick at first, until you encounter enemies that heal themselves for large amounts every time they attack you, or sub-bosses that can heal an ally to full in a split second.The best part about the talent trees? You can reset them on a per-character basis for free as many times as you want (outside of combat only, of course), to A) check out whether that cool-sounding change to the warlock's nuke attack that turns it into a channeled health drain is as good as it sounds/fits your preferred playstyle, and B) change the tools available to you in combat based on what kinds of enemies you are facing. Find yourself in a new area where none of the above-mentioned self-healing enemies are present? Go ahead and respec your shaman for increased potency on his heals, or even swap him out for a dedicated damage dealer.As for the combat itself, well, it's a bit like trying to play a relatively simplistic version of some other kind of game *cough* world of warcraft *ahem*, sorry about that. Except your party of 4 is controlled entirely by you. The active-combat-but-with-pause tag applies well, but unlike other entries in the genre (mass effect 2 sort of? KOTOR 1/2, dragon age.. um.. anyone other than bioware making games in this genre?), the combat system feels like it was built around the pausing element specifically, rather than adding the pause option in as a last second adjustment to a game that was too bulky to be practical without it.Coping with powerful enemies in this game has much more to do with positioning and actively responding to enemy actions, via commands issued during pauses. Where most RPG games expect you to survive a powerful spell by simply having accrued enough experience points from grinding to boost your health and durability stats to the point where enemy attacks are negligible, Aarklash offers you no such opportunity. Dodge or die. (sorry to have to make a pop-culture reference, but it's kind of like Team Four Star's DBZ Abridged Piccolo is watching over your shoulder as you play! You don't want to let Piccolo down, do you?.. he's probably going to hit you in the face if you do)There are also several steam achievements in the game that are actually difficult to achieve, such as two particularly nasty challenges based on completing certain portions of the game without ever using the pause feature. It is hard. It is also fun, and satisfying to finally succeed. That is all I feel compelled to say about it.---There are a few downsides to the game I would like to address for the sake of being fair and balanced. The equipment and looting leaves much to be desired, and the ending of the game is one of those ""Hey, you guys like sequels right?!"" endings. Needless to say, if there is a sequel, I will be first in line with a fistful of dollars to throw unapologetically at the developers.---Did I mention that Wenzil is awesome?---Wenzil is awesome.			"

												Surprisingly good. Plays like a isometric action RPG with a pause key to tactically issue commands. Animations are fluid and abilities make sense. On higher difficulties regular use of the tactical pause is required for aiming and timing of abilities. Enemies must also be analyzed during combat to counter their spells, repositioning, and what not.Other than that levels are pretty linear, but include the occasional secret a little bit off-road, as well as an increasing amount of puzzles, the further you progress.Classes and abilities are quite original for an RPG, and seem thought out well.

												The only shortcoming of this game is it's brevity.  But otherwise, it's a great addition to any library, especially tactical RPG fans.If you like anything like the Baldur's Gate series, XCom, and FF Tactics, you'll love this game.The 8 characters play very differently, and even more so depending on the build.  The skill trees branch off in each skill, and there are even 2 variations on the ending of each branch.  There are SO many viable options, it's great!  There is no ""this is the only way to build character X or you'll suck"", and that has become a huge problem IMO with games like this.The enemies are varied, and challenging, and often enough brutally difficult.  There are a number of fights that had be throwing my hands up and /headdesk'ing.  The key to this game is TACTICS.  Varying how you engage each group to take on the different roles and setups that each INDIVIDUAL encounter brings.  Some are the ""same"" kind of fight, but the skills will change from race to race and so a unit that may be a melee bruiser for race A, you'll engage entirely differently for race B.The characters are fun and engaging, and the conversations are well done.  They're by no means stellar, and no one has any particular lines that are incredibly memorable, but they're done well enough that you don't lose interest, or better yet, want to pull your hair out.  The story is even good, but nothing wildly new or exciting.  In fact, it's rather cliche, minus the fact that your team isn't really the ""good guys"".Even with all the lack-luster parts of the game, this is still superbly done.  I really cannot recommend this enough.			"

												Considering that I never heard anything about this game in the media, and that it is only $20, I expected this to be a low production game. I'm happy that my expectations seem very wrong! I'm 90 minutes and and am really enjoying myself. The  combat is fun and engaging, but not a clickfest like other ARPGs. The storyline is off to a great start, and you don't have to know anything about Confrontation to understand what is going on.			"

												I have only just finished the first act, so this recommendation is a bit premature. That said this is a really good game. The combat system is reminiscent of Dragon Age Origins, but much, much better. All the various party members play in very distinctive ways and while each character is limited to 4 skills the upgrade trees allow for surprisingly substantive changes in playstyle. There is a lot of interesting potential character/party builds and since you can respec and change the party any time you aren't in combat you are free to try them all.Another feature I really like is that you can pull up the enemies stats and skills. Knowing what skills your enemy has is hugely important (particuarly for boss fights) and it is a lot of fun to plan around those obstacles. Anyways, if you like the genre you should get this ASAP. The story is a little lackluster, but the combat is miles ahead of the competition and that more than makes up for it.			"

												This game is amazing, I can't believe it isn't getting more word of mouth.Seriously. This is the closest to that ""Baldur's Gate"" feeling I've had since....well...Baldur's Gate. You can respec per fight. You need to be constantly using micro skills WITH tactical consideration. It has all of the strategy of a TBS but none of the slow boring mop up. The characters are all unique, with interesting back stories and relationships that are written like an actual adult human being wrote it. (a rarity these days) The voice acting is done well imo though that's subjective and the story is a well-trodden plot device but the whole backstory of the Goldmongers and the Quorr and the idea of a ""Wheel-Sword"" (one warrior at each wheel of a caravan wagon?) is pretty original. (ah, google tells me they bought some IP)I haven't finished the campaign and I play slow but there seems like there is going to be enough content for the asking price. Hell, I'm hoping for a 60 hour campaign with DLC at this point.I'm 40 years old and I still play a ♥♥♥♥load of games. I've played a ♥♥♥♥load of games this year. So far (yes its feb I know) this is my game of the year. But honestly, if it came out in Dec it would be in the running for the game of last year. The system that Aarklash has is just so fluid once you master it. (really easy to move all your characters instead of just one when you are learning the game, learning that you have to be constantly paying attention to projectiles and you have to actually read some of the enemy descriptions to figure out how to beat them)I don't know what else to say, great job guys, sorry this isn't getting more press. If you keep the content coming I'll keep buying. This is an awesome enginge you guys have please keep using it, it'll catch on.I've played Cyanide games before and I can see how the gameplay in this is an iteration of the combat in Game of Thrones and Of Orks and Men but if the combat in those games turned you off trust me, it's much more responsive, fast paced, and gamer friendly than those other titles. This is by far the best Cyanide game yet and a must-play if you're a fan of the old Infinity Engine games.			"

												Finally, a single-player/multi-character RPG with real-time combat that isn't based on pen-and-paper games or owned by Bioware/EA.Aarklash: Legacy is a party-based top-down isometric tactical RPG in the style of Dragon Age and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - pause the game, queue up commands to your party, and then unpause.There are also a significant number of puzzles, but they aren't particularly frustrating and the worst of them are easily solved in under 10 minutes.The awesome:-Single-player/multi-character real-time combat with tactical pause for people tired of Bioware/EA's near-monopoly on the genre.-Combines some of the best of MMORPG/MOBA mechanics with old-school design and puzzles.-Mix and match 4 characters out of 8 total with no limits. 2 healers and 2 tanks? You can do that. 4 DPSers? You can do that. Reshuffle your party whenever you aren't in combat-Unlike most classic or classic-style RPGs, there are no consumables. Your characters automatically regenerate all their health and energy outside of combat, unlike most classic RPGs that require you to rest. The advantage of having no consumables is that you win or lose based only on skill and character builds. In a traditional D&D-style RPG, you could build and play your characters poorly and win by throwing around entire bags of consumables, or you could have a perfect character build and lose anyway because you ran out of consumables. That doesn't happen in Aarklash: Legacy.-Bioware loses its monopoly on the genre.The good:-Puzzles require some thought but they aren't frustrating.-Intuitive and smooth UI design.The bad:-Game balance is somewhat broken. Boss enemies usually have abilities that instantly wipe characters. Control effects that take the keyboard and mouse away from the player last way too long (15 second mind control or 10 second knockdown???). On the other hand, some characters have 10 second stuns too, so the bad balancing can also go the other way.-Lack of character customizability. Each character gets a predefined advantage and disadvantage - instead I would rather have a choice of a few advantages and disadvantages, or even choose to have neither. Character development is only 4 items with RNG stats and a tiering/affix system straight out of Diablo, plus a minimal skill tree. There are no skill choices, just variations on the same skills.-Characters' run speed out of combat is somewhat slow and gets incredibly boring if you have to backtrack.-Lack of hybrid characters, their roles are mostly rigidly defined as tanks, DPS, or healers-A lot of the skills appear to be designed to artifically force your characters to work together. Giving characters skills that are useful on their own and even better when chained in a specific sequence is one thing, it's another thing entirely to make characters almost completely dependent on each other.-Characters have no AI if you aren't controlling them. If you want other characters to use skills or retarget you have to queue them up manually. If you were expecting something like Mass Effect or Dragon Age where characters you aren't controlling remain somewhat competent, you will be disappointed.-No story choices.The unacceptable:-The entire game is completely linear (see also: ""rail playing game"") with minimal alternate paths to the same destination and perhaps a few dead-end forks in the road with treasure - and it doesn't look like there's any official modding support.-Minimal replay value.-Some types of enemies have narrow counters and it's very possible to get yourself stuck in a fight with the wrong characters. Save before every fight!The verdict:Aarklash: Legacy combines the best of new and old party-based RPG paradigms into real-time with tactical pause combat almost never seen outside of Bioware/EA games. Character and skill mechanics are almost solid with a few large problems. Unfortunately: an almost linear environment, significant balance problems, and the lack of modding support weigh heavily on it.The regular price ($20) is somewhat steep for the amount of content - I got this game on a large discount (somewhere between 80% and 90%) and I recommend buying this only on deep discount. At the very least, wait for a 50% sale if you're impatient.If you enjoy some aspects of classic RPGs with the tactical depth and real-time combat of MMORPG/MOBA style games, I recommend that you buy Aarklash: Legacy... if you are also willing to overlook its design problems.My suggestions to the devs:-Add support for a nonlinear, respawning world.-Add modding and custom characters.-Faster running out of combatMy overall review of this game:-Graphics: 8.5/10. The graphics are impressive for an indie game, but I found some performance issues.-Audio: 8.5/10.-Game design (mechanics): 8/10-Game design (world and lore): 4/10-Replay value: 2/10-Technical quality: 8/10-UI: 9.5/10			"

												Aarklash: Legacy , rpg - tactical game.Highly recommended for tactical-rpg lovers.If you have played Dragon Age : Origins , you won't be a distant to the system of Aarklash. You can pause the game in order to plan your strategies, your movements and attacks of your party. You have a decent party , includes tank, healer and damage dealers, which you can place them anywhere on the battlefield and carry out your strategies as you planned. Some skills are skill-shot ( for example, basic healing skill ) that you need to aim correctly to use it affectively.On the other hand, graphics are quite fine , but could be better to have more visual side, but still this game has some good atmospheric soundtracks.But I must say, story couldn't wake my interest really well, but played it for it's rpg elements and atmosphere.But still, if you really like tactical-rpg's , you should give this game a chance.

												Overall I recommend Aarklash: Legacy to players who enjoy squad based tactical combat games. Though I would suggest only picking it up on a decent sale as it has little to no replay value.The game is graphically beautiful, with good sound tracks and good combat mechanics. I very much enjoyed the world and setting and the combat ocassionally challenged me to think and prioritize targets. However I must honestly say that the game has its flaws that may or may not be a deal breaker for you. I will list my pros and cons.Pros:+Good Graphics+Good Combat+Ability to reset skills at no cost+Synergy between party membersCons:-Short game with little to no replay value-Poor character voice acting and timing-Puzzles are very easy-Gear is not so great, randomized.-Leveling is not balanced right, you will max out your characters abilities halfway through game and there will be no further development on them the rest of game aside from random gear you find. I enjoyed playing the game, but the ending left me wanting more from it. It is a decent game, just don't expect it to be perfect or well polished. If you can look past the faults it is actually a fun play.			"

												Aarklash: Legacy is basically a group-based strategy/action RPG. You'll spend much of your time pausing live combat to issue commands to your units, such as heal, aoe, buff, silence, knock-down, etc. You control 4 units in your group at a time, but as you progress through the game, you'll find new characters that you can swap into and out of your group at any time that you are not in combat. You'll progress through a linear game that is filled with combat scenarios, and puzzles. Enemies drop a combination of white/yellow/purple-named items (as usual in arpgs). You can equip your group with these items or destroy the item to build up a meter that will create a new rare item with random stats. Opening chests also drop random items. You can save the game before creating a new item or opening a chest, then reload the game in hopes of getting another item that is more favorable. It sounds like an underhanded tactic, but it's virtually required if you wish to gain items that each group member can use. Each character has 4 skill trees to level up, which branch out into different paths, meaning you have some various in how you build your characters. I found the pacing of the leveling system to be rewarding. The writing and atmosphere were unique. I wasn't sure if this game was based on a series of novels or already established lore, because some of the story seemed too unusual for a small video game, but I did not find any novels regarding Aarklash. I found the game to be satisfying. The graphics were surprisingly good, along with the music. It's not a very deep game, being linear and relatively short for an rpg (around 20 hours), but the story was good enough. At $20 or less, I believe it to be a good value, and I hope to see a sequel or expansion.1-10 Scale:Graphics: 7.5Sound/Music: 7Story: 7.2Fun: 8.2Value: 8.1 "

												Aarklash can be best described as the Warcraft 3:Frozen Throne hero missions remade in 2013. So in a strange sense Aarklash is similar to DotA 2. As a genre you could say Aarklash is an ARPG, but it does still feel like the actual combat is from a RTS game. First and foremost this is an RPG game, and not a stat-fest like an actual ARPG (also you command four characters at all times). Skilltrees and Items are fairly simple.Graphics, Sound, Characters, Writing and overall production values are all very good. You will like this game if you like Dota2/LoL and RPGs: get this game if like anything i mentioned above, it is a must if there is a good sale on.			"

Not really. Is the voice acting decent? Not even close. How about the visuals? Not the best I've seen. And yet there's is something special in this game, that makes you keep going and repeat those failed battles, wonder about character progression and spend a lot of time on choosing the best equipment.What I loved about this game the most, was the difficulty. Man, did I curse a lot, I can't even count the number of battles I thought were impossible to win, and the feel of accomplishment, when I was able to push through.If you don't mind the rather boring story and awful voice acting, and appreciate the good challenge, you will have a blast with this title.

												This could've been a fun tactical team-based action RPG for me.Looks good, sounds good, character progression seems good enough.And it is a good game worth it's asking price, and by all means try this game (maybe on a sale) if you like ARPG's.This simply is not a game for me.Maybe the game gets better after a while and I'm throwing in the towel too soon, but I have been burned too many times when I continued playing games that I wanted to like, games that had the potential to grow on me, but just didn't.I just don't have the will and patience to spend time on a good-game-but-with-annoying-mechanics when I can use the same time playing a game I actually enjoy.My main problem with this game?The devs think it's fun to make combat more 'difficult' by providing enemies with cheat-like skills.Like for example skills that give them (temporary) complete inmunity to all damage.Imagine fighting a boss and not doing any damage at all for several seconds while said boss is doing damage to you just fine. At best it makes you cross your arms and wait until that timer is over so you can actually play the game again. At worst it is initiated at the brink of a victory that then turns into a defeat that was completely out of your control.I quit when I encountered a boss-like enemy with such a powerful healing mechanic that actually killing it would take ages; not skill, just a lot of time and a bit of luck.Oh ... and why is the camera so close to the ground? Because of that you will be hit by enemies using ranged attacks outside of your view. That is never okay.			"

												If you like combats , this game is for you. The combats are essentially based on the skills of differents companions (don't count too much on the items to boost the companions stats). You can reset the branch of skillls any time to try differents approachs for differents ennemies. And watch carefully the differents abilities of the ennemies. However ;- the story is a classic one, so don't expect a fantastic story- the maps are very linear- the puzzles are basic , and there are too much of them at the end of the game- the items are just rings , amulets and such			"

												This could've been a fun tactical team-based action RPG for me.Looks good, sounds good, character progression seems good enough.And it is a good game worth it's asking price, and by all means try this game (maybe on a sale) if you like ARPG's.This simply is not a game for me.Maybe the game gets better after a while and I'm throwing in the towel too soon, but I have been burned too many times when I continued playing games that I wanted to like, games that had the potential to grow on me, but just didn't.I just don't have the will and patience to spend time on a good-game-but-with-annoying-mechanics when I can use the same time playing a game I actually enjoy.My main problem with this game?The devs think it's fun to make combat more 'difficult' by providing enemies with cheat-like skills.Like for example skills that give them (temporary) complete inmunity to all damage.Imagine fighting a boss and not doing any damage at all for several seconds while said boss is doing damage to you just fine. At best it makes you cross your arms and wait until that timer is over so you can actually play the game again. At worst it is initiated at the brink of a victory that then turns into a defeat that was completely out of your control.I quit when I encountered a boss-like enemy with such a powerful healing mechanic that actually killing it would take ages; not skill, just a lot of time and a bit of luck.Oh ... and why is the camera so close to the ground? Because of that you will be hit by enemies using ranged attacks outside of your view. That is never okay.			"

												Great game. The dialogue is a bit childish but a lot of RPG's seem that way. But the focus of this game is combat, and it is almost constant fighting. It reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics, in that there is some story and occasional chats amongst the party, but it is mostly about battle after battle, and they are finely tuned to be really challenging. It is real time with pause so plays sort of like Dragon Age only with deeper and more interesting combat. There are also quite a few puzzles. Overall it is kind of like a lower budget Dragon Age Origins. There are no cutscenes and no questing, but there is the combat and they put more effort into that than Bioware ever did. Each class has a skill tree which gives 2 options for each skill/spell, so you can customise the characters to play how you need them to play, and in such a challenging game, you need to make sure you make smart decisions. You can respec any time for free, and some fights you will want to respec just for that one fight. I don't think casual gamers would last long in this game, but fans of games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, FFT, etc, will love this. I hope more people buy it so maybe we can get a sequel with a bit more fleshed out story and stuff. If you like tactical party based combat, there are not many games as good as this.			"

												You this looks like a great game, plays like a great game. Has a lot of character like a great game should. But what is not great about it is that basically every encounter is TPK. Sure I hear you say, just learn how to play the game right? Well reality is I have given it ago and I have play alot of other games that don't punish the player for just playing the game.It would be enjoyable if it weren't having to replay every single major battle (and no even always major battles) over and over again with the hope that another slightly different combination of limited tactics (read micro-manage your way through it, but not having enough abilities/powers to get there) would actually let you succeed in beating whatever the game throws at you.

												The Story, Atmosphere  and Voiceacting is a little flat but ok. The Charakters have not much charm, but id didnt realy care. Also the maps are boring and seem to have no tactical value. To be honest, at first it felt like a pretty looking testingplatform for the gamedevelopers - not like a finished game. But i hoped for more and gave the game some time and got rewarded. The feeling of beeing overchallenged and bored disappeared fast. Over time the Game gained more and more depth. It combined tactics with rpg elements including a possibility to craft your own artifacts. The Fighting and Balancing of this game is done very well. Also the loot and optimization progress felt just right.If you look for a fast paste action Game, you probably should stay away from this game. But if you like playing the tactical way with and against unique and challenging Creatures, you should give this Game a try.			"

												Close to recommending this game, but just couldn't for a few reasons.Pros:-Good tactical combat, interesting fights and enemy mechanics that make you really think-Decent graphics, character models, spell effects, etc...Cons:-Flat, one-dimensional characters that don't really develop. What you see is what you get.-Uncompelling storyline, you just don't care about it.-Gets very stale about halfway through...you just want it to be over.-Character levels cap out quickly, limiting development.-No currency and a weak item system that doesn't encourage much experimentation. By the end of the game you have an inventory full of junk and you don't know what to do with it. I feel like there is a lot of potential here that they could improve on in a sequel but this just felt stale and unfinished. At first it was good but got old very quick, if you are looking for a good tactical RPG I have heard Pillars of Eternity is great and might be worth your time.			"

												I really like this game. Its combat system is one of the best I saw on time. Complex skills that needs timing to unlock all its power, other skills that counters enemy tactics (convert enemy healing in damage, or taunt a chaneling protection shield from the enemy support to your tank), interruptions, blinds, silences, order queue which makes controling the WheelSwords smooth.The loot system is kind of anecdotic. Sometimes the enemies drop stuff. Is worth it? I guess so, it helps to further customize your units, but getting the right combination of stats may be a problem, basically because every character is played diferently. One sacrifices hp every time it uses a skill, other don't have mana regeneration, etc. It may get difficult at first to learn the skills and checking all its skill tree branches, but once done, you may be swaping between them.Another great thing is that you can rearrange the skill tree points whenever you want (out of combat), so you dont need to make a second run to try diferent tactics.The puzzles are kind of easy, but entertaining until you realize how to do them (maybe a couple of them may give you problems until you realize how the mechanic is).The maps are beautiful and the sound is ok.The only con I see to the game is that you can never use all the characters at once :(I think I would recommend this game to the players that like tactical games (arma tactics, final fantasy tactis, dawn of war 2, xcom).

												Frustrating, mechanically flawed combat. Pausing adds nothing to the game. It just slows things down and gives the developers an excuse to make enemies annoyingly difficult. In other words, a cheap way to increase game length while creating the illusion of challenge when really you're just exerting unnecessary effort.The characters are also quite dull and the story is weak. The maps are too linear and there is usually nothing much to do other than walk around and open the occasional treasure chest. If the whole game were just a series of battles with cutscenes in between, it would actually be an improvement.			"

												This is one of those games where I'd rather have a ""meh"" option than a straight ""Yes"" or ""No"" option.  Aarklash is pretty, and it runs just fine for as much as I've played it.  However, its claims of ""Tactical combat at its best!"" seem to ring a little hollow, and I find the game to not offer enough tactical choices to really make any one battle different from another.You have extremely limited options for customization, here.  You get four abilities to each character, with that character basically pre-defined by these abilities and some passives.  The ""skill tree"" is really just an upgrade tree for the skills each character has to have.  Each skill splits into two different branches, where they basically do something like one branch inflicts silence, and another does blindness.  Your only real choice is in which four of the eight characters you take.  The game trailer says something about ""skills working together"", but basically, all I see is bog-standard tank, DPS, heals, and control.  The game basically plays like a stripped-down version of a MMO's or DotA's combat, but with pausing, rather than the more tactical combat in Dragon Age.  In fact, there's an achievement for specifically NOT pausing, which makes me wonder why they advertised it as a pausable real-time like Baldur's Gate when it lacks the depth of such a game, and encourages you not to pause?  Smells slightly of false advertising.  Skills are also either extremely expensive, or have extremely long cooldown times, so you basically only get to use them once per normal fight, and maybe 2-3 times in a boss fight... if they're useful at all, since several of them are rather situationally useful.  You recover full everything after a fight, anyway, so you might as well just throw the skills out there just because it's use it or lose it, but there isn't any real feel of that being tactically challenging.  Even playing hard mode, I didn't feel like I needed to do much but let my guys throw punches at whatever they target first, and just slap off all my skills one by one.  When you level up, your choice is mostly around which skill to pump up, but since you basically only get to use them one per fight, it's really more about just trying to pump enough points into a skill to either reduce its cooldown or mitigate it's situationalism so it's actually useful.  You can make one skill fully upgraded early, while leaving others the basic level, and one useful skill you can kind of use frequently can generally be better than a bunch of useless skills, but it's really dicey, and doesn't feel very rewarding as a gameplay mechanic.  Boss fights are ""more challenging"", but I found the trick to them was generally more to just give them the Benny Hill/Yakkity Sax treatment, and just run circles around them while the rest of my party killed the minions, and while my skills cooldown timed out, rather than having to find some sort of interesting combo of skills that doesn't seem to exist.  You fight two swordsmen.  Then you fight a swordsman and an archer.  Then you fight a swordsman and TWO archers.  Then you fight two swordsmen and a mage that casts easily-dodged magic bolts.  All the while you get maybe a powerup that gives you a slightly different move every 12th fight.  Basically, every fight is exactly the same except for the boss fights, and then I tended to rely more upon giving them the Yakkity Sax than any more clever strategy.I also can't recommend this game for its story or characters.  Dialogue with the first four characters basically goes like this:Dog-headed cleric woman: ""Grr! I want to kill them all!""Golem tanker woman: ""Heehee! Killing people is fun!""Leader mage woman with a stupid hat: ""Shut up, all of you! Listen to what I say! Now I say kill them all!""Goblin assassin guy with a giant rat on his head: ""Wait, you mean the joke-character looking assassin has to be the reasonable one who knows what he's doing in this group?  Oh well, at least I know how to read a map and tell you it's contents.  Why'd the jester wannabe get to be the leader?""To quote Dorothy Jones Heydt, ""I don't care what happens to these people.""  The NPCs basically all exist just to go, ""Rawr! We are on the other side from you guys, so let's fight!"" (And the PCs respond by talking about how much they enjoy killing...) It's not tactically challenging, and it's not enjoyable to read or watch. It's not awful by any stretch, and there are obviously people who liked it.  Maybe it improves if you slog through for another 6 hours, but I can't really say I enjoyed it.			"

												Tried to like it but the game is too limited in abilities to counter what you face (especially considering the difficulty even on easy) in my opinion, I'm also guessing that since the skill tree is just buffs for your already possessed / default base skills it's going to get repetitive quickly which is a shame cause there could have been serious potential for some cool abilities and such. Imagine for instance if you were able to steal / learn enemies skills (Final Fantasy VII style for example), that would have given it that tactical edge in terms of fun and meeting the challenges on a more varied / fair way. I don't think it's a bad game if you get the run of it and don't mind it's limited / repetitive nature but it just tips over that 'frustration' border-line for me :(			"

												This game looks like it has a lot of potential, but it's buggy and plays like garbage.  It hangs even on the lowest settings when moving the mouse around the main menu.  Then it will hang every three or four seconds when moving, giving orders, or trying to pause to take advantage of the ""real time strategy"" interrupts.Especially fun is how the Auto command will get stuck in your action queue causing your healer to spam attacks while your team dies.  You can click to cancel the action, but it just stays there with an x on it until the target dies.  Cool down on your high dps attack finally over?  Tough poo nannies, cause your mage is going to deal 25 dmg per second until that skeleton with 1,000 hp dies before it even thinks about casting it's next spell.I hope it gets patched, and I'll be happy to adjust my review then.

												The game and characters are set in a world full of potential but a mix of poor pacing and overly complicated enemy abilities make the game a slog when it could've been really enjoyable. It doesn't help as well that the story slows in pace the further you progress with the ending being a cliffhanger that doesn't really resolve any of the questions that the game sets up from the beginning. It almost feels like the game started with a particular narrative in mind and about half way through they turned it into a generic bad-guy wanting to destroy the world.I'm definitely interested to see if they devs/IP release a sequel because there really is so much potential/originality in the content however the game/battles need a lot of polish before it becomes an RPG worth sinking time into.

On the other hand theres a handful of spells and abilities and they make the gameplay repetitious and boring.How many times do i need to prove to this game i have understood and mastered the fact that Wendaloos shuriken needs clear LoS to land, that i need to be far away from Antimagic fields?Its dull and boring, its the same test over and over, with the most infuriating buggy pathing and AI in any ARPG to date.

												Started off loving the game, but the difficulties are a mess.  On medium / normal every fight is a struggle and the damage and healing is just not good enough, plus the controls are gammy and the character do not always do as you tell them to.  They have a mind of their own.  If you put it on easy then there is no challenge as you just walk into a huge group of enemies and they do not even damage your team, it is like God mode.  I fear the devs have tried pleasing everyone and made a really hard game for the people who get a giant e-peen for cheesing their way through impossible fights and then made a faceroll mode for people who can barely use a mouse.  There is no middle ground.Then there are the out of place puzzles you would normally find in a budget hidden object/puzzle style flash game on facebook.  Look it I wanted to do level puzzles I would play on my wifes laptop.  Think I will stick to stuff like Baulders Gate and Pillars of Eternity.

												The game is good and I would have reccomend it... but only for someone who is not familiar with Bioware, Bethesda or Black Isle production. I can't remember who the hell told me that this game is like old Baldure's Gate... Not even close.Pros:- Graphics- User-friendly gameplay and interface- Simplified loot system. No gold, no stores. You don't like something - put it in trash. After several times you will get an extra unique item- Tactics. At least pretendence to it.- Each charachter is unique!Cons:- It is not Baldure's Gate! No choices, dialogue options. Strict liniar walkthrough- Though the skill-tree for each is unique, for each character you have only four basic skills with 2 variations for each (8 choices in total). And I can't say they are good- don't think it is even close to RPG. You have an RTS with active pause.- Mostly no tactics at all or it is simplified ( I couldn't believe you can make more simple rules than stone-paper-scissors, but they did)- No party creation, no customization or change in appearance over time, no weapon choise, no stealth- Could have a good plot, but the dialogues ruin it- While the graphics are good, can't say about the effects.

												100% hack and slash, 0% RPGbasically you go battle after battle with some cutscenes dialogue-like with NO choices.i'm quitting it after 5 hours, it suffers being A LOT repetitive.The pros:- setting is pretty good- animations are well made- the combat system is deeply strategic and very challengingThe cons:- after 40 minutes of playing you are given all the game can give you- grind grind grind grind- NO RPG at all (don't let be fooled by the tags, this is NOT an RPG)mine is a thumb down. try it only if you love diablo!

Posted: November 28, 2014
												so i really loved the game with a few annoying parts:)i found it extremely well made on all fronts:the thing i noted which i  found very good was:the skills system is nicely made, it is simple while still having planty of complexity for diversity.the understanding of ""things should only be as complex as needed"" have really been done here, and it works very well.combat:combat is done so well, all encounters feel well balanced, well setup and you do think over what you are doing etc. it feels fluent and you feel like you got the time needed for setup etc while not stressing that you have no time or that its too slow paced.items:the items are very simple again, % increase to dmg etc. which works extremely well for what it is, again only the complexity needed should be there and it is :)there is again enough variation due to the 8 characters that you will use time on tweaking it but not so much it will take the flow of the game which is well made.crafting:the crafting system consist of ""put whatever you dont need into this box and it will give you random top item""; this is AWESOME for this type of game..i cannot express how tired i am of RPG games making me have to be the Best ""blacksmith,tailor, weaponsmith, shoe maker, hunter, gathere etc"" just to acquire the best items, not only is that kinda thing stupid as hell from an RPG standpoint (seriously you are suddenly better at this then professionals that have done it all their live and at EVERY profession -.- and no one else can make equel items that you can even if you hand them the mats? come on man that is sooo stupid) but it also is a HUGE needless timesink that does nothing but break up the gameflow.SO it is AWESOME to see devs actually understanding this. TY.Progression:there is very little character progression in the game, it basicly comes down to get a skillpoint when you lvl, equep new gear.while i think it could have given a bit more here it actually doesnt take away from the gameplay, since there is 8 characters focused in each their area you never feel like you would have liked to build a char differently then it is by default.so this is ok for the game it is :)Puzzle's:all puzzle's tool between 2-10min to do, which is nice, it's not a puzzle game and therefore puzzle's should NEVER leave the player frustrated or truly wondering what he could do to get through it.they where challenging enough to make me brain go ""hmm"" but not so challenging it went ""FFS grrr"" which is exactly how hard puzzle's should be in an RPG (if you want truly hard puzzle's go play an advanture game where the focus is puzzle's)on top of that the puzzle's where well spread out through the game and never used more then 2-3 times (same type of puzzle).so very nicely done.FLOW:gameplay flow, properly the most importent in a game, and the one where RPG's normally truly fails.this game did it perfectly: i never felt bored while going through the game, i never felt it took too long between combat or puzzle's dragged on for too long or that i needed to break up my advanture to do some silly timesink thing.the flow was close to perfect and i was very engaged the entire time. so VERY well done.Story:i loved how the story doesn’t start with “you are the chosen one above all else, now go do your stuff of destiny blablabla” seriously RPG makers evolve beyond this already..so it was VERY nice that the story felt real and as something that from a fantasy pov was relatable, while not saying “you are the chosen one” they are not going “ow hell if you should know wth is going on or why you need to do stuff, just go randomly do stuff” which is the other extreme and again feels really forced and but. this is something that almost all rpg fcks up -.- including AAA title’s which are truly horrible at this (sigh looking at the new Dragon age game and almost all other aaa title’s the last 10 years).So as said it was nice that they did it in a way which felt “real”, now without spoiling too much they do move towards a “destiny” plot (although it isn’t destiny as such, but still I am a bit disappointed with the ending/last 2hours of gameplay story)Characters:I LOVED this, how long time is it since, no wait I don’t remember a single RPG where you got this much diversity in characters to choose from, seriously :D And I don’t remember when I last got the chance to play a “bad” guy type thing..So we got:Orc, goblings, ogra’s (which actually look their part not just stupid reskins of humans), we got 2 legged machine centure thing, we got a human sorc(only human so it is nice to have), we got a LICH!! You can play as a lich I mean how awesome is that :DA “chaos dwarf” thing, and we got at the end a hyena humanoid though :PAnyway the playable cast and personality difference is HUGE for such a little gameAnd the playstyle is very different for each character which is really nice.I can’t remember a single RPG before this one where I was thinking “damn I wish I could use more companions at one time” my normal though is “damn I wish I could remove these annoying companions they do nothing for the gameplay or story, just in the damn way”, but here I truly felt like I wanted to be able to use more of them all the time, and it was great.Voiced:The game is fully voiced and while it’s not the best voicing it is a decent+ job and it adds a TON to the gameplay, I am really happy it is there, the only character I felt was a bit out of character was the lich. But personal pref I guess :) But it is a big plus too the game, and they had some cool ref and things they said while they stood around, one ref that sprang into mind was the gobbling saying “gobbling: well if we are just gonna stand here lets play some bloodbowl” just awesome :P heheMaps/lvls:The lvl and map design was very well done, big enough for me to explore with rewards for doing so, small hidden stuff as well worth getting.And never did they show me something then go “nanana if you cant figure it out you ain’t getting it” which is annoying as hell in every game they do that.. if I didn’t find it I don’t wanna know it exist! I wanna go through the game feeling that I found every treasure and got the maximum out of my playthrough:This game does that perfectly.On top of that I didn’t once feel that the map design hindered my combat gameplay. So very good job on this as well.Now there is a ton of good stuff and there is of cause a bit bad as well, not much though:hmm not enough space to write the cons so will do it fast :) (stupid steam)so ending left a lot to be desired.autosave wasn't very good.if you have a party member die you lose the game if you dont ress him fast enough (19h only an issue 4 times)its very liniar but it is fine because it holds you engaged by the story and awesome characters.I do hope they will make more like this even though I doubt it, I had never heard of it before and it was by pure luck I bought it and I am VERY happy I did so.WELL WORTH both the time and money :)			"

												Aarklash: Legacy is a surprising tactical squad combat game that takes queues from RTS games and ARPGs, but more than anything feels like the developers played a lot of MMORPGs. At first blush, the combat system is something rather novel, feeling like a blend of all four, and the first hour of the game is pretty good.Pluses:Talented visual direction outside the UICreative cast - for example your tank is a raptor looking golem ladySolid music, generally good presentationInteresting riff on tactical combat - feels like a blend of RPG, RTS, MMORPG and a lot moreNegatives:Terrible voice acting direction. I don't mean the voice actors are bad, but they're disjointed and don't play off each other at all, and the dialogue just isn't very good.Bad loot system. I'm not even sure why the game HAS a loot system.Overwrought character design, yet highly limited abilities. You feel underpowered fighting trash mobs. It's tedious.A lot of the mechanics are overabundant and simply tedious. Dodging projectiles is cool the first time. It's obnoxious the fifth time. Having to line up your projectile attacks which will hurt your allies or heal your enemies when they aren't under the same restriction is extremely tedious.The worst UI I have ever encountered in any game in my entire life. Tiny mouseovers with tiny text. Crucial, important facts have to be pulled out of the game and squinted at to read. I mean truly, incredibly dreadful, there's no reason for enemy buffs to be a tiny little number in the corner of the corner of the screen. I can't even begin to fathom how this passed early alpha testing. There's nothing even going on in most of the screen!Essentially - great ideas with tedious execution that just gets boring a couple hours in. I really wish the game was good, because the creative blend of concepts is so wildly unique, but it's not polished balanced or visually enticing.			"

												Game interface and tactical widerness is criminally poor for a game that calls itself a tactical strategy. Units' reaction to commands is very slow and unpredictable 'cause of stupid AI, and it ruins any gameplay tricks you can try. For example: You use healing ability to heal your low-health tank, but healer just stands still and autoattacks, even if you cancel attack! BTW, ability design looks nice but reveals its annoyingly stupid and usinergic after giving it a try. The only bright side is sympathetic graphics and overall high production value (for a indie game), but who cares if gameplay is so poor and game is boring and unexciting. 4/10...			"

												Right now, I am not going to recommend this game, I will explain it later. The things I like about this game is that it is really well done in the game play. The animation of the characters are smooth and it is challenging to play. The background graphics are stunning and very beautifully rendered and, though it does have it's quirks, the UI is pretty decent. But, now for the bad. At first, when I started the game after downloading and installing it, there were no command choices at the start up screen! So, I used Win 10's compatability program and it fixed that problem. But another one now exists. The game crashes every minute of play or so. This is frustrating. I go so far against an enemy, and the game would crash with a pop-up pannel telling me that the game had crashed. I got outside the building and went against 2 other enemies and as soon as I defeted them, the game crashed again. And it crashed when one of the characters got an item. It crashed again when one of the characters went up a level. Then, I went to one more Boss villian of this section of the game and it crashed again! This does not make a  playable game. And it doesn't matter the settings, it will still crash. Also, it would have been nice if it would let you choose or create your own characters, but that's not in the game. Also, when your character powers up, you have no choice where the power up points will go. But, I can set that aside if the above is somehow dealt with. I'll still play the game, but right now, I'm giving it a thumbs down with the buggy crashings.			"

NOT WHAT IT WAAS RUMORED TO BE I was lured by comments and got this game. My opinion comes after completing the game on easy, while I started it on ragnarok difficulty. Stats just scale with level and gear you find holds little significance. The game got rapidly boring with futile puzzle rooms which burn game time, rather than feeling worthwhile. The story is ok, (saving the world as usual) music, dialogs and sounds are all decent. Graphics are smooth even. Other than that, the game belongs in the tactical gender than the rpg one.			"

												**I RECOMMEND ONLY WHEN ITS ONY 50% OR HIGHER SALE**Its fun.. But certainly not worth $20.00!  If, like me, you can get it on sale, its worth a shot..I like pause n play tactics.. The heros dont reflect any gear you may obtain, to there appearance, but they only allow for jewlry slots (5 i think)..  But there is forking upgrade paths for each heroes 4 abilities.. 1 path at first, then after 2-3 upgrades, you choose 1 of 2 directions, effectively altering how the ability works, or strengthening it... It does look ok, but nothing thats gonna turn heads.. It does have some CTD issues occasionally..Its extremely linear, and enemies do not respawn, so theres no famring, and i havent felt ""OP"" at any point.. Granted i havent finished it.. There are certainly better titles out there, but i think i only payed a few bucks for it, so.. it was worth it for 5-10 dollars..Some of the battles dont allow for many ways to tackle them, until later on, when you start getting multiple teammates.. You can have up to 4 in you party.. Youve got your tanks, healers, ranged, and melee dps, Controllers (improtant), etc.. Much of the combat is absolutely necessary to utilize the pause-n-play feature... You will not win most fights without it, on higher difficulty...			"

												By far one of the best RPG/Tactical games I have played. Good story line (a must for me) with great voice acting. I started this game as soon as I finished the Dragon Age I game and my expectations for a good game were pretty high. This game delivered on entertainment.			"

												If you're a fan of the Confrontation/Cadwallon universe you will LOVE this game. It's isometric but it's more along the lines of Dragon Age's pause and react playstyle. The itemization will drive you nuts at times with it's haphazard assignment of abilities, but in the end, the epic items don;t add too much to the game. If you ever played the confrontation miniatures game gte this now!			"

												I caved and bought this. It's pretty cool! If you like tactical RPG combat then you should check it out. The best way I can think to describe it is playing a party in an MMO where you control every character. If you've ever played and MMO wished you could control everything then this is perfect for you. Just the way the set up works (Tank+Healer+DPS) is very MMO-like, but with old school CRPG-style control. It's different enough from the old Infinity Engine games (less focus on a complex ruleset and dice rolls), so I'm hesitant to compare it to those.Each combat encounter is unique and challenging, boss fights even more so. Lots of reactive play is needed, like getting out of the way of AOE attacks, interrupting spellcasting, and removing/stealing buffs. Prepare to die if you're not paying attention. Quicksave often.Graphics are surprisingly sharp. Looks great, runs well, and loads fast. Not much in terms of customization but it's not really needed.Negatives include horrible story and some cringe-worthy dialog. Voice actors are fine but the things they're made to say are just bad.Anyway it's from a small studio with pretty much no marketing so I felt like reporting back after buying.			"

												Strategy RPG with puzzles thrown in here and there. It's difficult, but more or less fair. I'm not particularly great at strategy games, so I said more than my fair share of four-letter words while playing through on the normal difficulty setting. Aarklash: Legacy is a traditional RPG in that you have eight set characters to choose from. While you can change their function by realocating skill points (yay skill trees!), it's not what I would strictly call character customization. There are tons of synergies to find between various characters/skills and the game does expect at least some situational awareness (switching between skill variants based on what sort of battle you'll be in next, etc).The story and characters didn't stand out much, but I found myself enjoying them regardless. I did manage to get twenty solid hours out of this game. Aarklash feels really good to play and I can recommend it to players who enjoy RPGs or strategy games. You can strap a time-bomb onto your tank to blow up all the enemies you've taunted. What more could you ask for?			"

												If you like serious tactic games in a fantasy setting, then this is about the best one out there.Aarklash pulls together some of the best aspects of various games:- In overall concept, its perhaps most similar to Final Fantasy Tactics.  The game revolves around a serious of tactical battles with a modifiable squad and an engaging, but linear, story.  But best be clear the battles are at the heart of the game.  This is not an RPG, its a tactical battler.- The battles themselves consist of a squad of four team members, with each of those members have four different skills.  The skills themselves feel like something drawn from a MOBA skillset - yet with the skill-shot difficulty ramped up so much that you've got to pause every few seconds to position you squad correctly.- Meaning that the type of player who will enjoy this game is much more likely to be you Panzer General type grognard.  This is a game of careful positioning, skill selctions and matchups, not speed-clicking.- The comparisons to Balder's Gate etc are misleading - except in graphical style.  Don't go in expecting dialogue options.  There is enough of the Baldur's Gate fun and flavour to keep the story ticking along and the characters interesting.Highly recommended - so long as you understand what type of game you are getting.

												With 75+% off this is really solid strategy game that will grab your attention for few evenings. If you like tactical RPGs that is. For full price however, I'd pass, unless really craving for some strategy.Game is hard enough on higher difficulty, complex enough stat/skill and tactics build around tank/dps/healing with sprinkle of control and positional movement. Graphics has its style, quite few voiced cutscenes, decent although cliche story. Love drawn art. Combat is almost flawless, solid, polished, almost doesn't fit for such otherwise mediocre title Aarklash is.Then again Aarklash seems like it had ambitions to be really awesome tactical RPG, much like Icewind Dale series, but failed somewhere. Not enough depth, not enough skills, items, ways to influence stats. Enemies and puzzles feel like artificially put in rooms, just to waste your time on your way, like in C class action movie, where something needs to die to make main hero waddle trough on his way to big bad boss.On interesting note this is how MMORPG raids would look like if it was single player.

												In total I give this quite unique game 7.5/10. At first, I was intrigued, but after a few fights, when the first bosses or subbosses came, I got frustrated, as there was not enough info on what to do, and if you can actually beat them already, or if you should first detour an fight some normal mobs... I really needed to get to the drawing board, after a day of pause, to give it one last chance... then however, I understood the fight, with a little help of the internet, and since then, I managed to play the game alone, and really enjoyed the tactical fights and quite unique skills... Healers almost never can also heal themselves, and the 1st tank availableneeded to spend HP to use its skills... also, there are a lot of nice puzzles inbetween the fights, so its actually strong on both ends, the tactival battles, and the puzzles. For me, it plays like the boss battles of MMPRGs, but even the normal mobs are very dangerous, and require watching what they do, which skills they have, what effect zones do what and moving you quad of heroes out of harms way.The story is also quite dark and unusal, so in the end, I am hoping for a sequal, highly recommended for the stress resistant!

												I highly recommend Aarklash: Legacy to all the fans of Action RPGs not afraid to try out something off the beaten path.While Cyanide Studios most definitely has a shaky reputation when it comes down to how successful or even good their RPG games ever were, they do strike gold most of the times with how unique the worlds they create are, and Aarklash is just that.It's quite the wonderful Action RPG that really goes out of its way to appeal to hardcore fans of the formula by making its gameplay as difficult and strategic as possible, and offering rewards to any who choose to venture beyond that and complete the bonus quests.As simple as the option menu is, it doesn't do a bad job at all of conforming to your specific rig with the least hassle you can encounter.The graphics are, for an Action RPG, in my opinion, as good as can ever be expected for such a title. The artstyle is gorgeous and colors are vibrant. The story is really not that complicated but well written and has a nice flair to it with the medium-level voice acting.My complaints on the game are the comstant frame skips when a lot of enemies appear due to lack of optimization for the graphics and the simple options menu.To reiterate, if you are a big fan of Action RPGs and don't mind playing games on a mid-level of quality, then you'll consider Aarklash a gem, otherwise, you'll probably be complaining about the graphics quality, voice acting, strategic combat system, and whatever else you don't find appealing unless you're playing AAA titles.

												Very nice and challenging game (at least on highest difficulty). Artwork is unique within the fantasy universe of orcs, goblin, dwarves and elves (between burlesque and gothic) and remain coherent all the way (although I haven't finished the game yet at all, shame on me).The gameplay is a succession of missions, unlocking more of the playable characters and story line. Missions are tactical combat in real time (with active pause) and you have to time your actions wisely as your characters powers have cooldowns (micromanagement is made easy with the pause). After the missions you get some loot which comes in different flavors (with or without cherry on top), enhancing some strengths of your characters depending on your playstyle with them (as most characters can take multiple roles - usually two directions - which you can enhance or not) and is always rewarding as even trash loot can be recycled and this is important as gear comes from the RNG gods which you may or may not be fully acquainted with.The RPG element of character building are not so in-depth, yet the simplicity of the skill tree (or spiral) is a pretty good thing there. Although this work in synergy with gear customisation and you have to plan what items to keep or recycle. While you can freely respec the skills, you can't respawn specialised gear in your inventory, so beware.All in all, this is a very well done game in all regards. Graphics/artwork, voice acting/story are positively peculiar and while the UI/gameplay are not so innovative, both their design and implementation are flawless.			"

												Just short of a true masterpiece - 9/10Aarklash: Legacy is a fun micromanaging RTS with an active pause feature.When a fight breaks out the game goes into super micro-manage mode and every decision you make can cost you.The pause feature allows you to issue commands and check the status of enemy spells and buffs so you can calculate your plan of attack (or move the hell out the way of that fireball!).It sounds more annoying than it actually is and what you are left with is a very challenging yet enjoyable experience that gives you true satisfaction when you complete every fight.Every fight can be your last in this game and the difficulty learning curve is quite steep but once you have the grasp of all of your heroes and their ability synergy, the game becomes just pure fun.Loot is available to collect from most fallen enemies and treasure chests as well as unlocked for completing certain puzzles in the game (which are an enjoyable break from getting beaten up all day). The only downside to this is that the loot system does seem to be very RNG and it seems that you can get literally any stat. Rather than increasing abilities the loot system aims instead to make you consider passive stats like mana regeneration.I appreciate that sounds boring but the more mana you have the more spells you can cast and there it is a direct DPS increase.There are 8 different Heroes to play with and each has it's own unique passives and abilities, building a team with good synergy is just half the battle. As your Heroes progress through the game they will level up and gain ability points to spend in their chosen skill trees. One of the greatest things about this game is that you aren't punished for re-speccing. Respec is free and immediate so there is no punishment if you wanted to try that move that has more %Bleed damage than a Heal you think you should have taken. The story in this game is very linear and started off very intersting but it quickly became subpar to the combat system.There is no doubt in my mind that this game is carried heavily by it's combat mechanics. But for such a cheap price tag, it's a welcome break from the crap that is forced down our throats currently. I recommend this game to everyone who is a fan of Strategy/Fantasy and heavy micro-manage games like Starcraft.			"

												So, I finished the game. It took me 21h on normal difficulty (but I tend to clear all areas and such, although it seems that - according to achievements - I still missed some chests).Anyway, I'd say this game is pretty casual (although difficult), meaning you can just hop in, play for a bit, save, quit. It's a great thing really. This, and the fact it loads in literally seconds helps a lot. You can just load the game, run one battle, get owned, ragequit. ;-)It's linear, and doesn't really have much character development (you do, however, level up skills (easy and free to respec) and find some items that just give you some basic stats), but the battles are pretty fun. You find out what a ""tactical RPG"" is pretty soon. ;-)Sounds and visuals are pretty great I'd say. Pauses a bit too long at times between characters speaking in cutscenes, which kind of breaks that ""smooth flow"", but that's really all I can complain about.Aarklash: Legacy seriously deserves more publicity. I had fun and am actually considering re-playing on the highest difficulty level.			"

												Brilliant game! Hope they bring out an expansion or number 2 ASAP. Wish I had manned up and played it on the ragnarok mode rather than hard as I could see the battle tactics could be played with a great deal more precision and monitoring, however I'd be lying if I said the combat was still in any way easy. For what it lacks in hero depth it makes up for in enemies skill and passive combinations. The puzzels were fun, if rather simple and at some points repetitive / lazy, but they broke up the monotony of the constant group fights quite nicely. The story line is as linear as linear gets yet I can not help but feel that this was not a priority, as the combat and team/skill combinations are so much fun. £6.40 for 18 hours of great gaming to complete is a bargin.

												This game has been the surprise of the month to me. Bought while it was on sale, if memory serves, under ten dollars, I had limited expectations about this game when i first saw it was not but a rather delightful discovery.To those looking over for a quick recap. Yes, Aarklash Legacy is worth your purchase and time. It is a solid rpg with engaging mechanics, it seems perfectly optimized.And now, on to expand on the good...The game has a good mechanic, basically, it is an over the head rpg in which one has the choice to pause and assign actions per each of the members of your four man team. I suppose that, in this aspect one could draw a parallel with the Dragon Age gameplay, but whereas the other characters could be controlled by AIs, this one expects you to micromanage each of the four character's actions, which i suppose makes the combat tighter and more demanding. The fights are a house of cards. One mistake, one character taken down because a buff is not applied or removed in the right time and the battle could turn into a loss, demanding your attention. Positioning plays a much bigger role in the game as some enemies have directional spells that must be dodging as they are casting them. Bosses have attacks that instakills those who are standing in the wrong place. And buffs play a bigger role here, affecting the combat from adding armor to reducing healing and potentially killing oneself, more than once a character died because there is a buff that ""converts all heals into damage"". So saving after each battle is highly recomendedYou have a list of four skills per character, that can be upgradeable several times, and each tier has variations of the same skill, adding lettle details like damage, range, and status effects. All skills also have a branching path that alters the nature of the skill in different ways. The good thing is that there isn't actually a penalty for refunding the points you invest and putting them in the skills as you want.The game looks great, with decent if not great quality in graphics and special level design. The ambience is said fairly nicely most of the time. Puzzles turn out inventive and amusing, nothing overly complicated but fun. And the game is decently optimized. Game loads fast and reloads are almost instant.You will have up to eight playable characters to use (and this isn't a spoiler as it is announced in the trailer). Each of them with their special advantage and disadvantage, their unique set of skills, their own personality and backstory. They are just too good. The chemistry between characters is hinted through little lines and eventually you get to root for them in the short time they game lasts ...Sadly, that leads me to the bad...The criticism is that, the game 'feels' too short. And no, it isn't short, the first playthough took me 16 hours, minus one hour which i suppose condenses the time i was afk. But it does feel small because all the things that transpire, is but a small odyssey. I am trying not to spoil anything but i feel like the potential buyer should be warned about this. Basically characters are in trouble, gather up and go to solve the problem. It doesnt really help that the game split itself into just 3 acts.My complain there is that it does feel like a wasted opportunity. There are 8 characters and u only travel in groups of 4. It is also convenient that there are 2 tanks, 2 healers, 2 spellcasters and 2 offensive characters. The idea of splitting them into groups was there but sadly it was barely used. The could've been more puzzles that required to use more than one character to complete (not that there aren't of those in the game, but could've been more) I also wished to know more about the other characters. Each of them had their own motivations and reasons to be mercenaries as well as their unfinished businesses for that matter, i half hoped they would deal with them (of course, given that the story here is only a trip it makes sense those sidestories arent touched)But then again, hopefully there will be a sequel and that it will continue the story. So far, this is a good game, and has a lot of replay value for those who want a bigger challenge.			"

												Aarklash is, for once, a $20 game worth $20 (though I got it for $5, yay).Prior to this I had a pretty low opinion of pause-based RT tactical games.  Usually the pause feature is just there to cover up for the fact that the game is a clickfest with too much information and too many commands poorly presented or hidden in menus.Aarklash has created the perfect pause-based gameplay.  The streamlined controls, interface, and action queue system present all the information you need without overloading your senses and all the control you want without forcing you to micromanage every single attack.The enemies are billiantly created, with complementary abilities and ingenius passives that force you to examine each enemy group, develope new strategies to counter their abilities, and constantly watch for them to start casting so you can pause, check what spell they're using, and decide how/whether to interrupt or dodge.  You WILL get that feeling of ""oh my god I just pulled through that by the hair of my teeth"" that you get when you take an intimidating clusker-f**k and turn it around through skilled reactions and battle control.  It's pretty rewarding, not to mention fun.The player's abilities are fairly well done as well, though I wish there are been a bit more depth.  You only get 21 points, which is enough to max out 2 of the 8 lines and almost one of the others.  In some cases this forces you to make tough choices and can lead to different gameplay, but often there seems (to me) to be a clear winner.Items appear to all be procedurally generated with three levels of rarity and the ability to recycle ones you don't want for  new highest quality items.  On the one hand, it gives you some of the constant upgrades you get from a rng gear game, but on the other hand you get so much gear it doesn't really matter.  That's all good, except the game also has no gear you might consider ""special"", so you never really get the feeling of having found anything cool or worth keeping.  Also, many of the stat mechanics are unknown as well (such as armor), which means it's hard to even decide what to use.There are a lot of puzzles in the game, and they are generally fun and at least semi-challenging (difficulty varies widely).The story isn't bad, but lacks depth.  The characters are well flushed out, especially given how limited the dialogue is.  However, several of them are pretty much useless (Bo Lahm, for example is a crappy hybrid horrible at both tanking and damage).  You'll have to use each of them for a little while, but for most of the game you'll use only the same 4 characters.Overall, it's a OK game on top of a fantastic combat system.  They could definitely have made it great with a bit more work, but I definitely recommend the game to any tactical RPG players.			"

												Very nice tactical game. Riddles are also solvable if you switch on your brain. A little backstep though : you control all characters only once, after that there is no necessity to equip all the chars - but as a first time player you don´t know this. So you waste a lot of time with comparing gear for chars you won´t normally play again after you´ve found your favorites. A little short but the twist at the end gives hope for more content - maybe oneday :) "

												Well this was definitely a fun game to romp through. You got not so typical characters with special skills. You got a fairly interesting storyline. You got your strategy planning and keeps you at the edge of your seat..The bad of it though... It is really hard... at normal level.. and fairly easy at easy level. Some balancing of the skill level required will definitely help.And the ending? Yikes.. after fighting through all that, I was definitely expecting a better ending.So yea, surely worth buying, and playing at easy level for the fun of it. It provided a fun exciting journey through the world of Aarklash!			"

												I got this on the auction last December, and I was quite surprised how enjoyable and challenging the game is.  At the beginning you often lose quite a bit as the challenges are significant right from the start.  You need to learn how to better use your units together to counter the opponents.  It takes a few failures to really figure out the mix.  The challenges continues throughout the game, as you can be killed in new battle situation.  Its really fun.			"

												I'm not sure what I think yet... I'm strangely drawn to this game and keep playing it.  You don't get to create your party they are fully realized characters and gain levels and skills - and as you play you get additional characters to chose from.  If you like games like Diablo or Torchwood etc. you'll probably like this game.			"

												The game has a good storyline, beautiful ambientations, companions with different abilities and mechanics and a talent tree that looks simple but is well thought and can be toggled every time. The gameplay never gets you bored since it is not simple if you don't take care of all the skills and abilities of the enemies. For once, a game that starts to be challenging at normal is surely a good change.All around are scatteded simple puzzles to break from one fight to another.Overall this game is great and has few cons that I want to share:-poor items pool -final boss too easy and there are not other challenges after him.-the game is too linear and it would have been nice to have some ""choices"" to make instead of just following up the story.I do recommend it and for me this game is a 8/10.

												I may review this better sometime but after 5 hours, the best way I could describe this game would be if you took the pause and play gameplay from baldur's gate, or more recently dragon age, and made a puzzle game out of it.  I always loved this style of combat for its tactical nature but in aarklash you can and must look at your enemies info panel to see exactly what abilities they have to know what to interupt, what effects to steal, if you need to spread out, if you need to block skillshots with your party members, if you need to flee after they die because they explode, if they heal, reduce your healing, etc.  The fights can be complex and do feel kind of like puzzles to solve because all the info is avail but you must figure out how to use it and what you have to win.I've not seen any towns, shops or anything but you do level up, find loot, spend points in a skill tree of sorts and find more party members to swap between with radically differnet play styles.  It seems to be a very linear experience solely based around its fantastic combat system and thats actually fine.			"

												Strategic and difficult srpg. The story isn't that great, but the combat is really awesome. If one of your favorite things about Dragon Age Origins was the combat, definitely try this game. It's very similiar to DA:O, except much harder. I like challenging games and this one fit the bill nicely even on normal difficulty.			"

												Aarklash is an evolution of Confrontation. If you've played that this is a deeper and improved game in the same vein. If you haven't played Confrontation, Aarklash is a combat (and puzzle) heavy game with limited exploration and a story that won't win any awards. If you're looking for a Baldur's Gate type game, this isn't it. This is more along the lines of Icewind Dale but much shorter (I'd expect 12ish hours or more depending on difficulty with puzzles and combat).This game does tactical combat very well. Combat is real time with pause using a group of 4 (out of a possible 8 starting in Act 2). All the potential heroes have 4 unique abilities with 2 possible trees for each move that can totally change the base move. Movement is required to dodge enemy abilities and some bosses have instant kill moves so positioning is key. HP and Mana refill quickly after battles so there's not much downtime between engagements either.I'm not very familiar with the background and lore of Aarklash but the taste of the world given in this game makes me wish someone would make a big ""proper"" RPG in this setting as it seems full of potential. The story quality is average though the subject is unique.  It really starts to seem cliché going into Act 3 but they throw a very nice twist in during the last couple of seconds so make sure you're listening as it'd be easy to miss if you're distracted.Maps are very linear with a handful of small detours for chests or the occasional optional puzzle protecting chests. The inventory is very limited too as each hero has 4 equipment slots and there are only 4 types of items in the entire game. There's some limited but random crafting too. After turning in enough items to fill a bar you get an epic item of the same type of item that finished filling the bar.Overall if you like tactical combat heavy games and aren't expecting a sprawling epic story spanning several dozen hours Aarklash is worth a look.

												The game can be unfair sometimes. Only one character can ever break crowd control once it is used. It is pretty annoying to have your whole squad charmed. Aside from that, overcoming these seemingly one-sided battles give you a sense of accomplishment. This game consists of a lot of deaths and a lot of quicksaving/quickloading. Get ready to get angry.			"

												It's like Infinity Engine combat...except everyone has 100 X HP and each prefix character only has 4 upgradeable cool down abilities to manage instead of AD&D rules.  The itemization is an after thought.  I enjoy it purely for the party-based tactical RTwP combat that demands heavy micro of your dudes.  (err 3 of the 4 starting characters are female)			"

												This game got me by surprise and hit me right into RPG nostalgia. I'm super happy I got it, even though it's more IWD than Baldur or Fallout. The overall feeling is very positive.+ challenging fights+ each character has one unique strenght and weaknes that need to be taken into acount+ fun skills (not Your standard bash, heal and fireball)+ easy respeccing+ interresting story (it's good, the thing that kills it is the delivery)+ the world and the characters are very interresting...- ...but You don't get to learn much about them outside from dialogues- weak dialogues (as non-native it didn't bother me as much but I imagine Brits will cringe every few lines)- only 4 skills per character (they evelove nicely making You want gain levels, but still - what You get at the very begining is what You will use till the end)- linear- almost meaningless loot! (the greatest mistake this game makes, You just stop caring about the drops) - 4 item slots, epic items are often weaker than lower tiers, replacing/reforging items is fun at start but seeing the minimal increase it offers and how time consuming it is, You just drop it untill You get max level and then choose the best, melting the rest.

												I just started the game but I can say that I think it have a great potential,first of all you are introduced in this new world and the charachter are very well defined, same for they abilities, and about their powers it's very interesting how you can combine them all to win a battle, maybe you will need to try more than once against strong enemies, but you will figured out how to solve the situation, so you need to think too, and use a strategy, and this is made in a way that you can stop a moment during the battle to think and see what spell you should/can use, against an enemy or to heal an ally. the selection of the spells is very simple ando the way that you can select all the heroes or one of them, more interesting it's that if one of them is down with no more health, it does not die immediately, but you can reach and help it with another hero still in health and rescue, or end the battle so they will be able to stand up again and get ready for the next matchI can say that i can reccomend it  even if there are a lot of games like this, I quite liked it!

												Decent Story, Great Combat, Graphics are nice. Level design is great imo. I really love how much detail the dev put troughout the maps.Music goes unnoticable but it's not bad It's just not very intruding which is a good thing.The combat is really great. I love the way that you have to position your units and i normally hate pausing to queue events but this game make it work fabolously. Good variety in enemies and i don't feel cheated with the cash i spent on this.The characters are kinda cute. Each with their own personalities. Voice acting is not that bad. But a bit awkward/quirky because only 1 is allowed to speak at a time and there is a short pause sometimes between them. But i can't complain.Some decent puzzles. ( i am horrible at puzzle-solving) and i found them easy enough. Just remember to be logical..Overall great game, really liked it. Must have if you love strategy games with great combat. 8/10(Feels a bit tedious at the end because you've maxed out your levels and all but still good.)			"

Usually the pause feature is just there to cover up for the fact that the game is a clickfest with too much information and too many commands poorly presented or hidden in menus.Aarklash has created the perfect pause-based gameplay.  The streamlined controls, interface, and action queue system present all the information you need without overloading your senses and all the control you want without forcing you to micromanage every single attack.The enemies are billiantly created, with complementary abilities and ingenius passives that force you to examine each enemy group, develope new strategies to counter their abilities, and constantly watch for them to start casting so you can pause, check what spell they're using, and decide how/whether to interrupt or dodge.  You WILL get that feeling of ""oh my god I just pulled through that by the hair of my teeth"" that you get when you take an intimidating clusker-f**k and turn it around through skilled reactions and battle control.  It's pretty rewarding, not to mention fun.The player's abilities are fairly well done as well, though I wish there are been a bit more depth.  You only get 21 points, which is enough to max out 2 of the 8 lines and almost one of the others.  In some cases this forces you to make tough choices and can lead to different gameplay, but often there seems (to me) to be a clear winner.Items appear to all be procedurally generated with three levels of rarity and the ability to recycle ones you don't want for  new highest quality items.  On the one hand, it gives you some of the constant upgrades you get from a rng gear game, but on the other hand you get so much gear it doesn't really matter.  That's all good, except the game also has no gear you might consider ""special"", so you never really get the feeling of having found anything cool or worth keeping.

												I've just finished this game for the second time and I'm still convinced that it is great.The Game starts off easy and with almost no challenge. But this changes quick and after a while you might scream at the game for being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But don't let that take your fun away, because as challenging as it might get, it never gets unfair. You just need more knowledge about your enemies skills, your`own skills, your tactics and some decent decision making to overcome ANY situation. Of course, once in a while a little luck does not hurt. The Game mechanics are well done and your skills are well thought. Sometimes a skill might be bad in the beginning, but once you've skilled it once or twice, it changes into something completely different and that might change your whole strategy. The characters are quite interessting, at least they were for me. I find it disappointing that I have seen so ""little"" of them. Especially the Rogue you start of with, became one of my favorite characters through the game and I would love to see another game with the same characters just after this or before this happened. That would be great.Of course, not every aspect of the game is great. For example, the riddles. The aren't hard and most of them can be solved in about 1-2 Minutes, but its annoying because so many of them pop up. Especially in the end. Just a little less of them and it would be okay. Or the Story. It turned out weak and the end wasn't that unexpected, though its not the worst either.On my own score list, this game has 8/10 and I can only advise you to play it.			"

												Great tactical battles. The active pause system works really well with all the position-dependent skills, and there are a huge number of character and skill combinations to mess around with. I love it when games let you respec on the fly to try different tactics, and this game throws different challenges at you that often require going back to rethink what skill branches to take. Storywise, I appreciate how unique the characters are (and voiced well enough) - this is not your standard virtuous knight+ranger+mage fantasy team. The plot, at least as far as I am, is also not the same save-the-world nonsense as countless other games, thankfully!In my mind, the biggest weak point is the item system (although I love that you can dump enough trash items to reroll a new quality item), but I don't find that it drags down the core of the game - it's more like it's not even there.

												In total I give this quite unique game 7.5/10. At first, I was intrigued, but after a few fights, when the first bosses or subbosses came, I got frustrated, as there was not enough info on what to do, and if you can actually beat them already, or if you should first detour an fight some normal mobs... I really needed to get to the drawing board, after a day of pause, to give it one last chance... then however, I understood the fight, with a little help of the internet, and since then, I managed to play the game alone, and really enjoyed the tactical fights and quite unique skills... Healers almost never can also heal themselves, and the 1st tank availableneeded to spend HP to use its skills... also, there are a lot of nice puzzles inbetween the fights, so its actually strong on both ends, the tactival battles, and the puzzles. For me, it plays like the boss battles of MMPRGs, but even the normal mobs are very dangerous, and require watching what they do, which skills they have, what effect zones do what and moving you quad of heroes out of harms way.The story is also quite dark and unusal, so in the end, I am hoping for a sequal, highly recommended for the stress resistant!

												**I RECOMMEND ONLY WHEN ITS ONY 50% OR HIGHER SALE**Its fun.. But certainly not worth $20.00!  If, like me, you can get it on sale, its worth a shot..I like pause n play tactics.. The heros dont reflect any gear you may obtain, to there appearance, but they only allow for jewlry slots (5 i think)..  But there is forking upgrade paths for each heroes 4 abilities.. 1 path at first, then after 2-3 upgrades, you choose 1 of 2 directions, effectively altering how the ability works, or strengthening it... It does look ok, but nothing thats gonna turn heads.. It does have some CTD issues occasionally..Its extremely linear, and enemies do not respawn, so theres no famring, and i havent felt ""OP"" at any point.. Granted i havent finished it.. There are certainly better titles out there, but i think i only payed a few bucks for it, so.. it was worth it for 5-10 dollars..Some of the battles dont allow for many ways to tackle them, until later on, when you start getting multiple teammates.. You can have up to 4 in you party.. Youve got your tanks, healers, ranged, and melee dps, Controllers (improtant), etc.. Much of the combat is absolutely necessary to utilize the pause-n-play feature... You will not win most fights without it, on higher difficulty...			"

												Primeiramente tenho que dizer que fiquei meio desapontado no início desse jogo. Estava pensando em algo mais parecido com Baldur's Gate ou Icewind Dale, mas ele se mostrou bem linear.Resolvi dar uma chance para o jogo e comecei a gostar mais e mais a cada batalha. O sistema de skills lembra muito o dos personagens do jogos MOBA como o Dota 2, deixando tudo muito dinâmico e divertido. Descobrir novas estratégias de batalha mesclando as skills dos personagens é algo bem gratificante, o que torna o jogo mesmo sendo linear e com um roteiro que não faz com que o jogador se apegue a nenhum personagem no mínimo divertido.É um jogo para se comprar em uma promoção e jogar sem esperar algo grandioso mas sim algo que irá te dar boas horas de diversão.Nota: 7.5/10.0PS: Não se esqueçam do F5 (auto-save)			"

												This game got me by surprise and hit me right into RPG nostalgia. I'm super happy I got it, even though it's more IWD than Baldur or Fallout. The overall feeling is very positive.+ challenging fights+ each character has one unique strenght and weaknes that need to be taken into acount+ fun skills (not Your standard bash, heal and fireball)+ easy respeccing+ interresting story (it's good, the thing that kills it is the delivery)+ the world and the characters are very interresting...- ...but You don't get to learn much about them outside from dialogues- weak dialogues (as non-native it didn't bother me as much but I imagine Brits will cringe every few lines)- only 4 skills per character (they evelove nicely making You want gain levels, but still - what You get at the very begining is what You will use till the end)- linear- almost meaningless loot! (the greatest mistake this game makes, You just stop caring about the drops) - 4 item slots, epic items are often weaker than lower tiers, replacing/reforging items is fun at start but seeing the minimal increase it offers and how time consuming it is, You just drop it untill You get max level and then choose the best, melting the rest.

												Great tactical battles. The active pause system works really well with all the position-dependent skills, and there are a huge number of character and skill combinations to mess around with. I love it when games let you respec on the fly to try different tactics, and this game throws different challenges at you that often require going back to rethink what skill branches to take. Storywise, I appreciate how unique the characters are (and voiced well enough) - this is not your standard virtuous knight+ranger+mage fantasy team. The plot, at least as far as I am, is also not the same save-the-world nonsense as countless other games, thankfully!In my mind, the biggest weak point is the item system (although I love that you can dump enough trash items to reroll a new quality item), but I don't find that it drags down the core of the game - it's more like it's not even there.

												I've just finished this game for the second time and I'm still convinced that it is great.The Game starts off easy and with almost no challenge. But this changes quick and after a while you might scream at the game for being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But don't let that take your fun away, because as challenging as it might get, it never gets unfair. You just need more knowledge about your enemies skills, your`own skills, your tactics and some decent decision making to overcome ANY situation. Of course, once in a while a little luck does not hurt. The Game mechanics are well done and your skills are well thought. Sometimes a skill might be bad in the beginning, but once you've skilled it once or twice, it changes into something completely different and that might change your whole strategy. The characters are quite interessting, at least they were for me. I find it disappointing that I have seen so ""little"" of them. Especially the Rogue you start of with, became one of my favorite characters through the game and I would love to see another game with the same characters just after this or before this happened. That would be great.Of course, not every aspect of the game is great. For example, the riddles. The aren't hard and most of them can be solved in about 1-2 Minutes, but its annoying because so many of them pop up. Especially in the end. Just a little less of them and it would be okay. Or the Story. It turned out weak and the end wasn't that unexpected, though its not the worst either.On my own score list, this game has 8/10 and I can only advise you to play it.			"

												I am not a fan of tactical games like this one. But i must say that graphics, sounds, characters voices are decent. There are also some puzzles, hidden chests, secret areas, strong bosses etc.  People who like tactical RPG games will be delighted. But since i haven't finished the game yet i can tell only this much.Better get it when it's on sale.Overall Rating: 7.0/10.0			"

												I got this on the auction last December, and I was quite surprised how enjoyable and challenging the game is.  At the beginning you often lose quite a bit as the challenges are significant right from the start.  You need to learn how to better use your units together to counter the opponents.  It takes a few failures to really figure out the mix.  The challenges continues throughout the game, as you can be killed in new battle situation.  Its really fun.			"

												3 ACTS for about 20h of gameplay. (15 funny and the last 5 a little dragged)Great Game, based strategic combat. If you like Icewind Dale, this is the game for you.--BAD-- :no customizations at all. ACT 3 is boringLoot is not very relevant (this is both + and - )++GOOD++ :perfect strategic combat.multiple skill three. They change your gamestyle.ACT 1 and 2 are interesting and funnyLoot is not very relevant (this is both + and - )			"

												It's not a bad game. I wasn't exactly enthralled with the combat. It was okay, not bad combat but alright. Characters where hit and miss. Some of them, i rather liked and others I didnt enjoy. The story was a little weird tbh. However, the ending was great. No spoilers here, but it was an interesting ending...I would recommend the game but it certainly isn't for everyone. Look it up first. Video review on Youtube or something before buying.			"

												good game...What i think needs to be said:- every char is different - and by different i mean completely different- you are not determined by your choices - play every char you like, chars that are inactive get ext either way. you can reskill freely, dependant on the enemy- the enemies have up to 4 active and 4 passive abilities - you have to read then! nd you have to plan how to react on them! You may taut the enemies healing beam on urself or just knock him down while channeling, completely up to uget it, play it, when you hate it after 2 hours you can still give it back anyway			"

												Greetings Everyone!Lately I’ve been going back through my library playing older games and ensuring I take the time to write them a review.  I will start by saying that I thoroughly enjoy Aarklash:  Legacy and wish there were more games like it.  Does that make it perfect, absolutely not.  This game is unique in the nature that it is a multi-party rpg with tactical level far above any other game of its type that I’ve seen.  One thing that makes it unique is the combination of pause play, real-time and a telegraphed skill shot system.  I would absolutely love for other companies to make something like this, in many ways it is more of an rpg with MOBA style combat and the closest other game I can find to this is the newly released “Champions of Anteria” which is a decent game in its own.Let us speak on a few things the game does not get right in case any of these are deal breakers.  The inventory is lacking but the alternative of not having one would lessen the game, at very least it would have been nice to see a general itemization that included item level (in the case of the game you only get rarity) and comparative stats.  Both of these are more qualify of life improvements and could be remedied with a patch as the current set up feels more tedious at times, especially at the end where you are managing 8 characters.The game is also tremendously linear, with very little side alleys or optional content.  It could also due with more story, there are several scenes that didn’t seem to fit with the locale or seemed missing content leaving me with the impression that something was cut, there is a scene with a library that looks like it was forced into the zone instead of somewhere it was originally intended.  Finally, I would have liked to see more customization and a bit more thought into the skills, some of which are basically auto includes verses ones that leave me with a ‘why bother’ attitude when so many enemies are immune or highly resistant to.  Lastly, with all the amazing boss encounters the last boss is left with a ‘meh’ feeling.What the game does get right is an AMAZING narrative that leaves me wanting more, from the character backgrounds, to the immersive atmosphere I’d love to see an expansion, sequel or book (the ending certainly leaves an opening).  I can only hope I see this game on KickStarter soon!   The graphics are amazing for what is being attempted while maintaining low requirements creating a game that succeeds on controls that had to be tight and responsive.  Ultimately, I long for more games like this one and hope that its creators are working on more of not only this game type but within this game world!  Highly recommend if it wasn’t obvious.			"

												I didn't think much of this game going in, but I am so glad that I gave it a shot. The combat, the fun characters and the story all seemed to click with me. My only, very slight, complaint would be the length of the game. A bit short for my taste, but it didn't detract from the enjoyment. I look forward to a few more play throughs with different party members! (where's the sequel!?)			"

												So this game is interesting.  I found it difficult at first, but then it became second nature.  More tactical than BGI or BGII, but less options or ""wrong"" choices.  I found myself attached to the characters by the end.  Interesting world, I enjoyed it.			"

												This one's got potential - but the pause, move, pause every 2 seconds in combat to avoid some of the harder hitting attacks gets really boring really quick.  I suppose that's part of the strategy but it is not much fun.  This game looks good and is interesting.  I like the story so far and the voice acting is okay although some of the dialogue is a bit tired.  This is the kind of RPG that could be amazing if handled correctly but for me the combat doesn't quite work.  Otherwise, it's a pretty solid game, and at least the devs tried to do something different.  It play a bit like a Diablo style game - with four characters - or like Krater with 4 instead of 3...  hope they balance it out a bit better - or change the combat so it's not just swing, swing, walk out of the way of an attack, swing, swing, try to use magic - oh, gotta cancel and walk out of the way of another attack.Oh, and there's no ""gear"" only one ring, trinket, earring, and a couple other items.  Weapons and armor, etc are WYSIWYG.			"

												It's a fun and entertaining game, that unfortunally get's repettitiv very fast. You do have a lots if different skills to develop but only 4 item slots per character. On the lowest difficulty there is nothing difficul but on the medium difficulty you are sometimes in serious trouble.Buy it if it's on sale and have a good time with it.			"

												This game is so much fun. I bought it on sale but would buy again at full price easy. You control 4 characters with 4 abilities each, much like dota or league of legends. Obviously it is hard to control 4 characters at once, so you get to pause the game and queue abilities which make things a lot easier. The game is not turn based which is awesome.The only downside to this game is there is no DLC and no sequel. I would recommend this game to any tactical RPG fan.			"
