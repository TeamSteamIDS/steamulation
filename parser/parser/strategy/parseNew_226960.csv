												A rather disappointing game considering the system itself had potential, but is unfortunately woefully incomplete (apparently more content is coming out as DLC, but the base content as it is is barebones).Initially the game possessed a intriguing system of unlocking new units through the completion of mini-achievements, allowing your cards to evolve into a more effective and specialised fighting force. Unfortunately this feature is only seen in the first half dozen cards before never being seen again.The game also featured several factions with different tactics and units that you can mix and match. Unfortunately again, all the factions with the exception of the army (Union and Confederate's are both considered the same, begging the question as to why it is set in the Civil War) have barely enough cards for a playable deck, much less one that you can base a unique strategy out of. This is further made worse by every faction's units being essentially the same thing (Army riflemen and bandits have absolutely no distinguising characteristics between them).Even worse, the potential dynamic was there, in the form of unattainable weapons and units the computer gets during the campaign. After completing the game, and every last achievement (both single player and multiplayer) I was upset that the only things I receieved were more of the same cards. Indeed, the final boss's deck is displayed as an available playable faction, but does not have a single unit or weapon card in it.The story serves it's purpose I suppose, so it is hardly disappointing, but it is somewhat baffling that early in the story you can clearly see a sibling rivalry, only for one of the brothers to disapear, and only come back at the end of the game to do absolutely nothing, unlike the collection of minor characters who assemble for the purpose of serving as an Deus Ex Machina during a mission. Whoever is actually manning and directing your ironclads is never mentioned (unless it is assumed that the sergeant who gets a brief mention early in the game is the PC). The Civil war is barely mentioned, and the game might as well be set during the Anglo-Russian war for all it matters.The campaign itself is not so much challenging as it is putting you in a situation with an outright disadvantage. In the early stages this disadvantage is negated by unlocking a new weapon. However, due to the fact that there are no decent unlocks in the later missions the game simply becomes a matter of chance. Hoping that the luck of the draw gets you exactly the unit you need, and that the computer does not use the obnoxiously overpowered ability that he is granted this mission on the turn it would hurt the most. The last mission in particular is guilty in that the enemy boss is not only invincible (unless you kill two heavily armoured units guarding an electric outlet, and procede to occupy both outlets with infantry that can be killed instantly by said boss) but possessing a repetoire of weapons far superior to what you can get, and heals completely should you fail to stop him from going to your side. The strategy towards defeating him involves praying to your chosen deity that the enemy AI will decide to lay waste to your ironclads, rather then stepping on your infantry, and will stand still for that brief moment where you miraculously achieve enough firepower to destroy him in one turn. God help you if you decide to go for the achievements.All that said, the game has potential. If it simply had more content and diverse factions that would allow for actual tactical options.			"

												I want to start by saying I like this game. I like it a lot. The setting is good and the gameplay is fun. It's a lot like Monster Monopiece, which I loved, but without the embarrising rub mechanics. Which is good.So why don't I recommend it? Simply put, the single player campaign is cheap. Really, really cheap. After the first few missions you're almost always started off at a huge disadvantage. The enemy has powerful cards that you don't have access to yet. The enemy starts with more AP than you. The enemy can field four ironclads at a time. The enemy has squares that provide and advantage much closer to their side. The enemy has a deck tailored exactly to take advantage of the battlefield.The only way to finish a mission is to have the exact cards the game wants you to. Want to build a deck around certain cards, certian factions or a certain strategy? Too bad. You don't get to choose your strategy. What you do get to do is play a mission several times to see what cards the enemy has and where he tends to play them. Then you get to build a deck specifically to counter the enemy's deck.Even then, there's a good chance you'll still end up playing the same mission several times. Like every card game, luck plays a large role. In this game it plays a very, very large role. Don't draw a single ironclad in the first six turns? Have four ironclads but no weapons? Have only powerful cards you don't have the AP for?Too bad.The worst part of this is that it's very hard to rebound from a bad initial hand. You'll run into situations where the enemy has four ironclads on the battlefield, while you have none. Even if you draw a few ironclads, chances are that the enemy's have better gear by this point and are already halfway to your side.So yeah, this game is a lot of fun. It's also a good way to see how much patience you have.			"

												This game has a framework with so much potential I was really excited the first few rounds.  Unfortunately, before long it starts to feel like playing rock-paper-scissors with, well, a computer.  Random play is equally effective as well-thought strategy and winning or losing feels like a flip of the coin.  However if you lose a round the computer will replay the round virtually identically so it becomes trivial to win next time.There's a really good game waiting to be made here, but this isn't it. "

												If you've ever played a collectible card game, do you enjoy constructing a deck as much as actually playing the game? If so, then you'll probably enjoy Ironclad Tactics.It's possible to slog your way through missions with sub-optimal builds/tactics, and granted, it is incredibly frustrating when played in that manner. The core missions are tolerant of bad play, so you can get pretty far into the game before realizing what you're doing wrong. After unwittingly playing badly throughout the main campaign, I eventually hit a wall in the additional content.The final mission of New Game Plus was particularly brutal, and I barely beat it after a couple hours of reckless attempts. As I moved onto the DLC missions, I found myself frequently devastated by the enemy having 1.5-2 times the resources that I do. Slogging through these missions was becoming increasingly unlikely, and I was questioning whether these missions were fairly balanced. Did I have to rely on the AI screwing up to stand a chance, or was there another way?At that point, I approached the game from a different angle. First play a mission noncommitally with a simple deck, just to grasp what's being thrown my way. Then go to the drawing board and construct a deck particularly for that mission. With that mindset, I was crushing missions on the first ""serious attempt"" and feeling accomplished in my decision making.Playing in this manner is a bit artificial. In what other game do you play a level for the first time solely to analyze it, with no intent of winning? I wonder if Ironclad Tactics could have been more forthcoming with its mission content, rather than have players flail through the motions with an uncatered deck.I recommend trying Ironclad Tactics with the ""study first, succeed later"" approach. That's what tipped me into the ""recommended"" camp. This is certainly a game for analysts/tinkerers.			"

												I've been playing Ironclad Tactics off and on for over a year. Only now, after earning every card, I realize that I forgot to write a review. It’s sort of a Plants VS Zombies game except that it’s Zombies VS Zombies, and the zombies are steampunk mechs.The pace is realtime, but it moves slow enough to allow some thinking time for your next moves. Most of the challenge comes from building specialized decks to solve the puzzle that each level presents. Your AI opponent will have the upper hand with some new attack or defense and you’ll have to come up with a counter. Most of the time this results in a tense battle of planning, wits, and fortune. When you tweak a deck combo into working just right it feels great! Each new card opens up lots of tactical options and completing challenges for cards feels rewarding.The civil war theme and story are awesome. I love the characters and animated comics that set up you journey across America. The in-game art and animation is beautiful. It’s easy to tell every unit apart and their abilities match the visuals. A robot with a jetpack files, dude with a shotgun has spread attack, and a flame thrower hits multiple targets. The music fits and is serviceable, but for me it’s one of the weakest points of the game. Something less traditional and more gutsy could have really helped some of the longer play sessions.Each level starts by showing you 5 random cards from your deck of 20, so sometimes it feels like a lucky/unlucky start can make or break a win. If cards come out in just the wrong order it can kill a plan, but managing this problem is also part of the art of deck building. It improved a bit with the release of the first DLC where you can now spend 1 action point to ‘save’ a critical card for later.The first DLC uses an army with a completely different and fun style of play. It’s satisfying playing as the boss enemies that were beating you down in the final levels and to understanding the logic behind how their robots transform. It also fills in missing parts of the story with more comics. The second DLC is very stripped down, but still provides new interesting abilities. Playing the ‘War’ mode, where you’re stuck with either French or Germany armies, varies the play styles just enough to keep things fresh.After completing everything it feels like every inch of the design space has been explored. Not every ability or tactic is perfectly balanced, but there’s lots of viable strategies to solve each problem. That said, I haven’t played multiplayer which would be a much better gauge of balance. There’s not enough players to support random matchmaking and I don’t feel like it would be that fun against friends (even if they unlocked all the cards). I also haven’t tried the co-op mode, which is supported throughout the entire game.If you liked Spacechem, you might like this. It’s about building machines, but stochastic machines rather than logical ones. If you loved Spacechem then definitely play this to support the awesome developers!			"

												I really enjoyed this game and chose to go through every optional challenge for a full completion of the campaign.  Even so, it was fairly short (around 12 hours for a full-clear?)  The multiplayer was also enjoyable, but not a compelling reason to buy.  The campaign missions, challenges, and puzzles were solid and I really enjoyed the setting for the game (more than I expected to.)  I recommend picking this up if you like a good strategic game with reasonable depth and multiple paths to victory.  I bought it as part of a full price two-pack and would buy again.  Completing all of the challenges (especially without using cards from much further on in the campaign) made this have just the right difficulty level for me to really like that challenge without thinking it was stupidly hard or ""lucky.""

												I was a very big fan of Space Chem (previous game from this designer) coming into this, with hopes of a similar brain-xploding idea of complexity condensed down into pure fun. While this has some great deck building elements and interesting play mechanic, it seems to just boil down to spamming cards. And sometimes the only way to learn a level is play it and lose 20 times with different deck builds each time before finally one clicks. Now this same process can be said for many games like Super Meat Boy or others of the same ilk, but while those are quick to reset and get you back into the meat of it, this game takes time and turn order. It builds up and leaves you very twitchy and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when the next deck combo doesn't work. Interesting premise and great presenation, but just hampered down by mechanics that seem to wear down before their final destination.			"

												I tried really hard to like this game. I beat the main campaign and then did the NG+. I lost countless times on the second map, which is part of the NG tutorial. You have a set deck of cards, and it was still almost impossible to beat and required amazing luck.And that's what makes this game so bad. This game lacks strategy. There is a little bit in deck building, but even if you have the best deck for a mission, there's a big chance you'll lose because of the luck of the draw. The last two boss fights had me cursing at the screen because the game puts all odds against you.Losing isn't fun, and this game does its best to make sure that you're going to lose. This game isn't worth it for free because it will just stress you out trying to enjoy it.			"

												I gave it a try during the free weekend and liked it enough to pick it up to own permanently. For the sale price at the very least it offers a fast engaging RTS type game where the real strategy lies in setting up your deck to beat the specifics challenges that each stage holds in store for you. Amusing civil war steampunk story and visuals just add to the charm as far as I'm concerned.			"

												I was unsure about purchasing this game initially, but I'm glad I did. Although the gameplay looks quite simplistic, it turns out that there are many different tactical possibilities. Each level can be a bit of a puzzle to solve, and the solution often comes down to building a different deck. If at first you don't succeed, change the cards in your deck. Even so, you could have a good deck but still lose due the random chance of which cards are drawn. The first few cards are often crucial at the start of a battle, but don't give up, I've come back from some bad starts and still won.Card games are usually turn based so I was a little surprised to find out that there's a fairly quick timer running constantly (with no pause unless you press escape, but you can't study the board while paused), so you have real time pressure forcing you to make quick decisions. Normally I hate this sort of thing, but in this case I actually like it. It didn't take long to get used to it, it ensures quick battles (which makes a nice change of pace for me because I normally play slowly) and while it puts you under pressure, the timer lasts long enough for you to make good decisions most of the time, although occasionally you'll mess up.My advice is to have a clear strategy in mind before you start each battle (and construct a deck to support that strategy), so that you know exactly what you plan to do during the battle. This makes it much easier to make quick decisions. Often you'll lose each battle on the first attempt, usually because the deck you're using isn't appropriate for the new situation, but just treat that as a learning battle to help figure out the best strategy to win it.Each battle often has 3 different victory conditions. You only need to win the battle to progress the storyline, but if you fulfill the extra victory conditions you win more cards. Often you'll need to play each battle 2 or 3 times to win them all, since you usually need to win some new cards to help you fulfil the extra victory conditions.There's a multi-player option and some cards can only be won by using this option. I'm not normally a fan of multi-player but this game seems ideal for it because of the fast play timer and the short games. I also think that playing against another human with a custom deck would make the strategy a lot more unpredictable and hence interesting.I've only played through about 10 battles so far so I'm not sure how much more the game has to offer yet. I may add to this review once I've played more.My conclusion so far is that the gameplay and tactics are better and more varied than I expected and it's proving to be quite an addictive game. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the random nature of tactical card based games, and the ability to create custom decks and play multi-player.[Edit] I've finished the main campaign now, there's 19 battles in all. Later battles become extremely difficult and can be frustrating to complete. But they're all winnable, the key comes down to designing an appropriate deck, but even then it may take several attempts due to the random nature of card drawing. In spite of the difficulty, or rather because of it, I found winning to be even more satisfying.I still haven't beaten all the battles with the extra victory conditions yet, but I'll be going back to do that. Not only that, but once you've beaten the campaign once, you can play the entire campaign again at a higher level of difficulty. I've spent 21 hours on it so far so there's plenty of value to be had from this game, and that's not even mentioning the DLCs which add new campaigns.In response to some people who've said that there's not much depth to the strategy, they're wrong IMO. There's a massive number of different ways that you can construct decks and many different strategies you can use, you just need to use your imagination. For example, the rubbish prototype ironclads you get at the start of the campaign often came in very useful in the difficult later battles, simply because they are so cheap (you can spam them and use them as blockers).So my final conclusion is that I highly recommend this game, provided you enjoy the random nature of card games and can handle the stress of the fast turns (you have about 3 seconds in which to play cards each turn, plus another 2 or 3 seconds to resolve the turn).

												(Most of the critisism here is about the expansion campaigns-- although I found the original campaign frustrating at times, it was in a more pleasant way!)I love pretty much every game Zachtronics has released, and while I find this game mostly enjoyable, the amount of artificial difficulty introduced is maddening. The AI isn't particularly intelligent. The computer will frequently, for example, equip a weapon to an ironclad that is 3 empty spaces away from making it to your side, which is a waste of AP.  If you pop an ironclad with a melee weapon right in front of an AI ironclad two spaces from your side equipped with a 2+ range weapon, they wont swap that weapon out to kill your ironclad and make it to your side-- it'll just sit there and die. To make up for the lackluster AI, however, the player is handicapped in a number of ways, making the game feel exceedingly frustrating at times.The player receives a base 1.0AP per turn, while the computer gets 1.5AP.  Then add on the fact that many of the AP-boosting objectives tend to be on the enemy's side, and the enemy often has units on the field to claim or defend them before turn 1.This provides the illusion that the enemy's deck is an endless bag of cards where they can just pull out any card they desire at any point. The computer rarely needs to play defensively because they can just spam units to put YOU on defense.  Maybe 10% of the time am I able to sneak a raider by the AI when there is an ironclad in play that they can maneuver into his path.  Manage to an armored ironclad out to scrap with one weilding a 1 damage weapon? you've got about a 75% chance that they have some way to boost the damage to ignore the armor(depending on enemy factions).  You can see how many cards the enemy has in hand, so I don't think the computer actively cheats in this regard-- it's just because of the massive AP boost that the AI gets-- cards don't need to go to waste.TL;DR- Playing checkers with a skilled player is fun, even if they beat you.  Playing checkers with an incompetent player whos friends pop in to give them extra game pieces whenever they lose some is frustrating.			"

A game that nearly bankrupted its developer, Ironclad Tactics is nevertheless a superb realtime card game that absolutely shines as a 2 player cooperative experience.Ironclad Tactics is set during a ‘weird’ version of the American civil war that sees foot troops fighting alongside gigantic iron automatons that command the battlefield with classically inspired weapons including cavalry sabres, cannons and even morale boosting trumpets, welded to their massive frames.Once you’ve assembled a deck consisting of ironclads, soldiers and various weapons and actions, you need to gain a preset number of points in order to win the round. Points are usually gained by getting your ironclads through the opponent’s defences and off their side of the screen, but certain scenarios can also include the need to hold fortified positions or destroy certain boss enemies.What makes Ironclad Tactics very different is its unique spin on realtime gameplay. Each card you play from your hand summons a particular unit to the battlefield and as the game ticks over in realtime, those units will then move, attack or perform some other unique action. At first the game can feel overwhelming as you have mere seconds after drawing a new card to decide whether to play it now or wait until your action points increase for the more expensive (not to mention powerful) alternatives already in your hand.The game has a very satisfying tactile feel to it and the rate at which you earn new cards (usually by accomplishing bonus challenges during missions) is judged perfectly with plenty of new and exciting additions to make to your deck as the game goes on.Where the game really shines is its cooperative mode. Whether online or over LAN, this game doesn’t present any confusing lobbies or account systems; just a very simple click of a button and you’re in and ready to play. It’s fast, clean and simple, and the game plays well with two players each taking their own personalized deck into an encounter.All in all, I really appreciate this game and I hope that developer Zachtronics hasn’t been perturbed by a few tepid review scores because their effort here is worth a whole lot more than all that.Read the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] "

YouTube™ Video: Ironclad Tactics Review 

			Views: 165		

			We take a look at the interesting real time strategy card lane game Ironclad Tactics! http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

Ironclad Tactics is a fast paced real time strategy card game set in a fictitious civil war era featuring steam powered robot warriors. The game features lovely artwork offering charming and funny comic strip style cut scenes. The core gameplay is centered on constricting your deck of 20 cards consisting of various human and machine warriors along with weapons and perks you can apply in combat.  You start the game with three randomly drawn cards and earn more cards upon one full cycle of the brief timer that counts as each turn, upon the completion of the turn you are also awarded an Action Point that you use to activate the cards from your hand. The main objective of each mission is to earn a set number of victory points that are obtained by one of your ironclad warrior robot troops successfully getting from one end of the battlefield to the other. The fast paced nature of the game is both what makes the game shine and at the same time is its biggest hindrance, the fact that you have to make decisions so quickly eliminates the ability to really thoroughly strategize and plan out your next move as would a turn based strategy card game would, however this little bit of hectic fast paced chaos is what makes the game different from other card lane strategy games.  Upon completion of the mission you are awarded with a new set of cards that have some unique twist or element that was the featured gimmick of the level. The game does offer a fairly steep difficulty curve that can become frustrating at times but adds to the overall length and replay-ability of the game when you have to go back and rework a new deck to try to conquer your highly competent AI foe. The game perfectly combines the good of both a Trading card game and a card lane strategy game; it offers a lovely art style, interesting setting, and a very challenging level of difficulty "

Pros: -Tons of Card Customization-2 Player Coop campaign-Lots of DLC and Side Quest contentCons:-Cheesy Story-Not Dubbed (Although, my friend and I had fun voicing the characters ourselves. :P)-Too much Time is focused on Deck Customization than on actual Gameplay. You have to consistently take the time to customize your deck for each scenario, otherwise you get trampled or overrun easily. -Most of the mission pass/fail outcome is entirely based on the luck-of-the-draw than on actual skill.

												Really intriguing concept, but gameplay (single-player, at least - I haven't played any online matches) is awkward and ultimately unsatisfying.On paper it sounds great: take the deck-building elements of a CCG and then use the deck to spawn not just static units, but pieces on a small gameboard (lane-based, in this case.) The biggest reason it doesn't all come together is that given the scrolling card mechanic, even the best decks show huge variability in effectiveness depending on draw order. You can play one round and get nothing but ""upgrades"" while your opponent rolls out unit after unit, then start over with the same deck and steamroll her right off the map. I know, you're thinking ""L2P n3wb, u hav to balance ur deck."" But that's really not it. A deck that's statistically well balanced can still hit awful runs, and because each player's hand is constantly pruned to the last 5 cards dealt, there's no recovering from them.As it stands, the strategy aspect of the game feels pretty much absent - less like poker, more like war (you know, the card game ""war."") Plenty of flavor, just not much depth.			"

												Fun tactical gameplay, cool graphic-novel visuals, and a cheap price. Sounds like a great package! And it is, for a little while. Unfortunately, the AI sucks, and instead of making a more difficult AI on the harder levels, it just cheats.That's right, instead of bothering to make the game challenge you, the devs just give the AI more action points than you get, no deck limit (you have one), and the ability to play cards and abilities outside of the normal phases. That's incredibly lazy design, and it killed the budding affection I had for the game.If you're a tactics fan and can get it cheap on a sale weekend, I'd say buy it - it's worth $3 for multiplayer. But I can't recommend it wholeheartedly due to the AI cop-out by the designers.			"

												This game was very fascinating for me, being completely unfamiliar with CCGs, limited interest in turn based strategies and none at all in computerised boardgames - this game is basically all three, and it's easy to see this as a tabletop game. However, it sucks you in quickly and, it must be said, sneakily. The tutorials flow seamlessly into the main campaign, from missions where you have just a handful of cards and playing them is so simple you don't even grasp what the challenge could possibly be, and yet soon every missions presents a new and fresh challenge. This may be the best learning curve I have ever encountered, and the tutorialising is very gentle. You encounter more and more challenging units to defeat, and the game encourages out-of-the-box thinking. Beating the game is a healthy challenge, and 100% completion is Herculean, which is how it should be.The story, meanwhile, is absolute nonsense but very enjoyable. That is to say, it's steampunk.

												Wow this game was total suprise for me, it's actually great! I wasn't into card games before but i find Ironclad Tactics mechanics to be prefect fit for me. It's fast-paced tactical card game, in which you have to achive about ~5 victory points before your enemy do. You can do this by simply getting yours Ironclad (steam-powered robot) to other side of map, or use map-specific equipment, like mortars and so on. Victory or defeat is the matter of card composition of your deck, and also on how you use it in battle. Also, music in this game is FANTASTIC! If you're someone who is looking for something different than regular fps/tps/othergenericgame and you are willing to use your brain this is a game for YOU!			"

												I like Ironclad Tactics, it is simple to learn, has great art style, and an interesting story. But above all it has fun gameplay! The story is told through an interesting comic style each mission, The story itself though I have got to say it kept me interested, maybe even more so than the gameplay. Each mission you chose to bring one of your decks and each of your decks has almost complete customizability. The biggest con I am having with the game is that alot of the missions end up with you just replaying them until you get the right deck build. This would be okay if the matches did not last so long. There is a great game to be made here, maybe some of the dlc can help improve ai/ missions? Either way I have got to say if you think this game looks interested and have money to spend I would tell you to go ahead and get it, only you can tell if you like it.			"

												The game is ok but, in my opinion, it should have been Turned-Based. Make it in real time is a mistake. You end up  sending units hastily to the front and when you want to react it's too late. It's a pity, because I like the setting and the comic style.			"

												A middling card game. Poor graphics, easy to learn but tactic options are extremely limited; ideal for kids. Not bad to pass few whiles although has expansions; maybe good against other player, because AI is shamefully cheater. Would be better with a turn-based system and (especially) big maps. The first loading time is long, afterwards runs well. Only worth with a huge discount.			"

												The alluring depth of a deck-building card game. The rapid-fire fun of turn-based tactical combat on a short timer. These two things synergize beautifully in this unique title from Zachtronics Industries, whom you might know from other games such as Spacechem and Infiniminer.Based on your love (or lack thereof) for card-games and/or tactics games, you should know right off the bat if Ironclad Tactics is for you. What you might not suspect, however, is just how beautifully polished this game is, offering singleplayer as well as both co-op and competitive multiplayer in a neatly-presented package.With artwork, sound, and interface design, Zachtronics has clearly lavished their game with a great deal of time and attention. When starting a new single player campaign, players will be introduced to the world through a series of stunning comic book-style panels. The artwork is colorful and the characters charming, with a breadth of facial expression rivaling that of some of the better webcomics out there. A similar level of care has been given to the in-battle presentation, with each unit and weapon having its own distinctive feel through a combination of looks, good sound effects, and interesting mechanics. Menus too are slick, with even more beautiful art and smooth animations. The whole experience is then tied-together with great music that had me feeling nostalgic for classic turn-based games like Final Fantasy Tactics.If any of this sounds appealing to you then there's no reason to delay - check out the trailer and then have some fun with Ironclad Tactics!

												Ironclad tactics is a fast paced turn-based tactics game based on card deck building. Since this description doesn't help, here is a slightly better one: the player chooses various soldiers and weapons from a consequent number of available ones. A card deck comprises 20 of these picks. Each deck has to be chosen carefully according to the needs of each mission. The battles consist of playing the cards (appearing in a random order) to send troops and give them equipment. They move automatically forward on the lanes they are deployed on, but the tactical possibilities are numerous with the ability to stop a unit, sometimes switch lanes, use weapons that target specific lanes, add a specific customization to a mecha and so on. The game seems like real time to the player, but the actions are conducted by the computer in quick, seamless turns.This might seem complicated on paper, but in-game it works very intuitively so that the player can fully focus on choices and tactical decisions. And the fast speed allows for the battles not to drag on, they even trigger a lot of adrenaline as the player has to think fast and is always kept on the edge. The gameplay is really good and works well in these half fast-paced half-slowed down conditions.However, where this game also really shines is in the level design. Usually strategy games can be repetitive as the players figure out their favorite strategy and repeat it to go through every mission. In Ironcland Tactics, each mission is different with the levels having a specific gimmick and the enemy deploying specific troops. While at first it can seem overwhelming if using the deck that was tailored for the previous level, this actually relates more to a puzzle game where the player has to figure out a well suited tactic to win. Card decks thus have to be customized specifically for every mission. So even if some might consider this very challenging when they don't know yet which strategy to use, I find it brilliant. It completely prevents the game from feeling repetitive with a single formula repeated ad nauseam, and keeps me thinking on how to tackle each new battle and makes me feel great for figuring out new strategies. Although, even if I mentioned a puzzle game inspiration, this game is not as static and mind taxing as a puzzle game, it remains very dynamic. The story missions are linked through nicely made comics, reinforcing the feeling that overall this game has been carefully crafted. Additionally, the story can be played in online Coop as the players fight together and have to coordinate their strategy (forget it if you are not on voice communication, good communication seems pretty much required to succeed without making stupid mistakes - well these mistakes still happen on voice communication and can be hilarious, such as when one player decides to give a speed boost to a unit from the second player who decided that it should strategically hold position). And if you want to get revenge on your teammate for a mistake, there is always the possibility for 1 vs 1 to settle things non peacefully. Also of note, some missions can add a nice twist to the 1 vs 1 multiplayer such as the possibility for one of the two players to use a boss deck.This game bears the ""Tactics"" subtitle perfectly well. I am very glad I discovered it in my Steam Library during its free week-end and gave it a curious try, otherwise I would never have known that this game is so good and keeps me so entertained while keeping my brain active.

												Ironclad Tactics presents an entertaining alternate take on historical events, and gameplay elements of a deck-building game combined with sort-of tactical aspects on a grid. Building the decks with new card unlocks is interesting, but only delves so deeply, and, in the end, the game suffers dramatically from poor randomization; I spent more than a few matches constantly drawing only the least useful cards in my deck, which is an even larger hinderance when it's clear that the computer has very plain advantages over the player in terms of deck power and how often the computer seems to get exactly the card it needs to stop my already weak advance. All in all, the game is fun for a few hours, and then frustrating for the rest.			"

												Hey, this is a pretty good game. I like how it plays. You can find many similar games like Final Fantasy Strike. It\'s definitely a pass in my books. PROS1. Interesting StorylineI appreciate game designers bothering to put a good story into the campaign. Nowadays, many game designers don\'t bother to do it. E.g. Titanfall.2. Increasing DifficultyI love this part. The designer engineered a style of playing that would cause you to lose if you didn\'t streamline your deck. This is the part I love the most.3. Easy to Pick UpI love the way the game is done.4. ArtworkSimple and stylish. Not as complex and detailed as the Marvel comics but it tells the story and looks good.CONS1. Short timespan to cast cardsThere\'s only a few seconds to cast a manoeuvre card. If you miss the timing, you unit will move forward and slide up/down instead of sliding first then moving forward.2. Auto-attacks instead of Move-CrushIf an automaton gets a weapon, it defaults to shooting instead of walking over a human soldier. SUGGESTIONS1. Weapon and Move-Crush modeYou need to have a method to tell your automaton to move-crush instead of shooting.			"

Card game. ""Tutorial"" could definitely use an overhaul. Surely, this might be just me but I'm rather done with these sorts of things. For pure card games, sure, but not for the crossover kind like in this caseIf you're up for trial & error and resistant to frustration, this won't bug you at all.

												Although I wouldn't recommend this game, I must admit that it starts out rather fun, and is full of interesting mechanics. Particularly enjoyable are the ""upgradeable"" cards, where doing certain things with a card gave you a new related card (i.e. the cavalry sword is a melee weapon, and using it enough gives you the officers sword, which does higher damage but has restricted use. Enough uses of an ally-buffing trumpet will give you a flamethrower ""trumpet"" weapon). And while early levels teach you some of the mechanics, they quickly become puzzles that test your understanding.However, both of these only extend so far into the game. After a few near the beginning, upgradeable cards become few and far between, and while early levels provide a variety of cards, later levels may require multiple playthroughs (including NG+) to simply get a full set of one card.And while the game starts off fairly forgiving, at certain points the difficulty signifigantly ramps up. At first this is just a change to requiring some planning for a level (which may require playing through and failing a level just so you know what is happening), but at a certain point the game starts increasing difficulty by making things increasingly unfair against the player, with some levels requiring a near-perfect deck and/or being the unholy union between a puzzle and a slots machine.Or maybe I'm just bad at the game.Either way, I've definitely had fun with this game, but its far from perfect and is becoming decidedly less fun as I progress further into the game.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Ironclad Tactics 

			Views: 104		

			Ironclad Tactics is a lane defense card game on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/226960/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

Ironclad Tactics is a lane defense game with cards.  It is a top down styletactical game that relays its story in a comic book fashion.  You gain cardsby completing missions, challenges, and increasing difficulty.The cards are organized a bit haphazardly, making it difficult to builda deck.  There are filters, but the way they are laid out makes it abit confusingas you build your collection.The missions aren't too complicated, but the game has increasingdifficulty and challenges that promote replayability.  The object is to getyour cards (or players) accross the board, on a turn by turn basis, and todefeat the enemy cards.  There is a luck element into what kind of enemy willappear and in what lane, and what cards you will have availble from yourcollection.  This randomization may appeal to some players, but the way thecards interact does slow the lane defense experience.  In the same vein, thosewho are used to card games may be disillusioned by the tactical strategy thatis necessary to the more quicker paced lane defense mechanic.I can recommend this game, but I strongly recommend that you are awareof the hybrid card/lane defense elements so as not to expect all of one elementor too much of the other.This is a summary of what I talk about in the video, I am a YT'er not a BloggerThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												This is a hesitent recommendation. The game's more about your deck-building abilities than the actual in-game strategy (although it does still matter) and the timed nature of the moves can be frustrating on occassion. They've made the DLC free and I can't bring myself to uninstall it, but I can't bring myself to finish it either. It's unique, though, and if you think you'll enjoy it, or it's on a heavy discount, you should buy it.			"

												I wish I could recommend this but despite enjoying the game mechanics for the first 7-8 levels there are some glaring issues:1) The story is terrible, the comic strip style would be fine if it told a coherent story but it fails completely. So much so that no story at all would actually be better.2) As the game drags on, each level consists of grinding out a victory against a CPU with better cards or a lopsided advantage like being near the bonus-generating spots3) The deck limit of 20 is just too small to encourage creative decks.4) Each level requires you to tailor you deck just right and until you start you have no idea what setup you need so you have to restart each time to get the necessary mix of soldiers, bots, etc.5) The start is crucial so a bad run of cards means restarting6) The luck of the draw just doesn't fit well with the rest of the game, you can't plan effectively when so much comes down to dumb luck.I'm a being fan of Zachtronics and love SpaceChem, it's probably my favourite puzzle game of all time, sadly this game just isn't fun and that's kind of the whole point!

												Honestly I enjoyed Ironclad Tactics....at the beginning. After a point the game starts to become incredibly RNG-based and spoon-feeds you specific cards to make decks. The game features a deck crafting system,as you may have gathered,but you can only use a maximum of 2 of the 6 factions in crafting. This makes some decks hard to create as the game doesn't like to give enough space to build some interesting decks.The campaign is rather short as well,although the story is interesting and using a comic style to relay the story was a nice feature. Personally I got incredibly frustrated with the later levels as the enemy seemed to be getting just the right card when I kept getting useless ones. The game also has co-op for the campaign and a multiplayer.TL;DR: Ironclad tactics has a nice art style,an interesting story,meh deckbuilding,and a cool concept however,the game is based incredibly on RNG and the AI is quite good at countering your cards.Buy it on sale if it drops to like ten dollars.

What To Expect Ironclad tactics is a good game. NOT a great one but a good one nontheless.i think that the game has chose a poor time to be set in. Being set in the civil war means you are limited to what style you can use or the locations you can fight in. If this game was recreated in a steampunk dystopian society with battlebarges, mad scientists and a government trying to push the public underwater (politicaly of cause). I also enjoy the comabt system using 'Ironclads' and infantry, but this nneds to be expanded on.Overall i recommend this game but if a better card based, fast paced battle involving Mechanical robots came along. I may be inclined to change.  "

												I got this game in a bundle and I was so happy that I decided to give it a try - I would easily purchase it individually.If you enjoy deck-building card game, laning-style gameplay, and the steampunk theme, then you will love this game.The aesthetics are great - the detail put into the cartoon-style graphics are very nice. The cutscenes are delivered in a comic-book style format, and the art is well done. The music is sounds are also good and add to the atmosphere of the industrial-age setting. I found the story to be decent, nothing too spectacular, but still very good. The expansions are also a lot of fun.The controls are very simple since you are primarily clicking on your cards to use, however, the learning curve can range from moderate to difficult. You will be at a good advantage if you are already knowledgeable in deck-building/pre-deck trading card games. Understanding the mechanic of ""synergy,"" or making sure that every single card in your deck has a purpose will ensure that you do well. If you are a newcomer, the tutorial is very helpful in giving you a firm grasp on the gameplay, and the extra challenges for each mission (which yield more cards) will also help you better understand how to make effective decks.You play the game by using decks of exactly 30 cards, with no more than 4 of each card. During gameplay, you randomly draw any card from your deck and it is put on a conveyor-style menu at the bottom of the screen. You also get 1 action point per turn, and these are used to purchase (and immediately use) your available cards. If your card pool is full, then the last card on the right will be discarded. There is an option to spend 1 AP in order to move the last card to the front of the lineup. There appears to be no draw limit, as you will cycle through your cards repeatedly (don't think you can run out of cards).Cards consist of units (infantry or ""ironclads,"" which are basically steampunk, industrial-era mechs), parts for your ironclads, and tactics. After completing missions, you are rewarded with more cards. There are also different challenges you can complete for each stage to unlock even more cards. New game+ is available, however, it is very challenging if you are not using a solid deck. There are multiple ""factions,"" (ex: army, experimental, etc) and your deck may be composed of a maximum of 2. The variety of cards leads to interesting strategies and surprises. Some cards have the potential for ""upgrades,"" where you can unlock a better version of the card if you complete something (ex: ""deploy this ironclad x times,"" ""this ironclad dies 5 times,"" ""deal 30 damage with this infantry unit (cumulative."").During play, you can summon units to move across the map (1 space forward per round, assuming default speed (=1)). You can click your units to have them hold position, and this is useful for camping your infantry on a mortar spot, which will generate 1 victory point for you each turn as long as it is occupied. Ironclads can trample most infantry units, resulting in instant kills. Getting an ironclad to the enemies side of the screen will yield you victory points (minimum 1). If you get the required number of victory points before your opponent, you win! Since ironclads enter the battle unarmed, you can attach different parts (a head piece and an arm piece) onto them - you are able to exchange parts so long as you have the cards and the AP. Example pieces include a shotgun, which shoots units in a radius in front of the unit; and a cat pilot that increases movement speed (3 spaces forward every round). Tactics cards include: giving an extra attack to your infantry/ironclad (separate cards), allowing your unit to move either one space up or down (lane changing), and bombarding an entire row for 2 damage each.The feedback is very useful and informative - you can hover over units at any time to see their attack range, damage, and stats.  If you enjoy laning and/or card-building games, then give this gem a try, you may spend a lot of time playing this one.Highly recommend!			"

												I was kind of dubious about this one.  Real-time card-based tactical battles sound like they could be fun, or a disaster.  In reality, it's kind of in between.  You only have a window of a couple seconds to play stuff, and if you're trying to do multiple things, it's easy to click in the wrong spot and screw up your whole plan.  It also sounded like it was based on the old Bureau of Steam Engineering browser game, which I played only a minute of and found incomprehensible.  Luckily, there's no connection except theme.The game also has the problem that you're drawing at random from a 20-card deck, so even with a lot of redundancy, you can get starting hands and continued draws that are exactly not what you need.  If one side gets a good draw and is running right out of the gate, while the other has to wait around for a few turns to get anywhere, the game could be effectively over already.  That's because board presence is vital, and there aren't that many ways to catch up once you're behind.The other thing about the game is that it lives or dies based on card variety and interactions (like most card games).  The cards are divided into factions, and you can only have 2 different factions in your deck at a time.  Some of these factions feel more fleshed out than others.  You unlock cards by completing missions in the single-player campaign, but even 100%ing the 2nd playthrough doesn't get everything.  One faction's cards wait on the first expansion campaign, which is good, but has to be purchased.  Once you've done the campaign, there's not much else to do but try multiplayer.  Each match you win here gets you a card unlock from a new, distinct faction.  The trouble is, there hardly ever seems to be anyone on.  So, it's a catch-22.  You want to get more cards, but can't get them until you win, but have only MP battles to use them on once you do, but can't even get those battles in the first place.Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  These potential difficulties mostly fade away when you get into the game.  The interface, the look and sounds of the units all feel right.  Evan LE NY returns to do the soundtrack, which once again fits the style well.			"

												Campaign is artificially difficult with the enemy always in a much better position and with better cards. There is little strategy there since most of the advanced missions are so luck and deck dependent that the strategy consists of building an exact counter to the decks used b the AI.

												Very fun game. The artwork/storytelling is just great. Also the music is top notch to the point where I want to buy the soundtrack to this game. This game can be frustrating at times and sometimes you may have to take a loss to figure out the mechanics of a level. If you cant ""think on your feet"" do not get this game, there isn't a pause button. The turns go by reasonably quick.			"

												Brilliant mix of turn-based gameplay and CCG/deckbuilding. All cards unlocked through story and optional objectives. You need to build a deck with the right mix of units, operations (which can do things like change the lane your Ironclad is moving in) and equipment.Fast-paced, as every turn has a set limit of seconds in which you can play cards. This makes it feel very alive and hectic, while still keeping the strategic advantage of turn-based gameplay.Well-thought-out story, good art. For fans of both deckbuilding games and turn-based games. Well-made co-op to boot.			"

												I like this game, and I can't quite put a finger on why. It's unique in the sense that there is no other strategy game which quite has the same mechanics, but it also lacks a compelling hook to grab the player. It's fast paced, frantic, and in many ways based on luck (What cards you pull from your pre built deck), but akin to magic the gathering deck construction / field choices usually win out. I'm going to go against the grain on this one and give it a recommendation not because the game is inherently incredible, but instead because it's faultastically innovative. It's shortcoming is also it's greatest strength. If you like card games and RTS, you'll probably have a bit of fun with this one. 7.5/10			"

												Though the writing in Story Mode left a little to be desired, I remained engaged enough to play through it in its entirety (as well as much of the Game+ mode). Largely, this was due to the game's various mechanical systems, none of which were necessarily ground-breaking but which were brought together into a compelling whole. (E.g., deck-building + tactical positioning + well-balanced factions). Also, the decision to go with a twenty-card-deck meant that, while the significance of each card choice was considerable, it was also far easier to gauge the effectiveness of specific strategies. As a result, this might actually be a good choice for introducing someone to the genre.In all, I had a lot of fun with this title and will likely return to it at some point in order to check out the expansion campaign. [Note: I have not played any of the multiplayer modes, though I'd like to try the Co-Op at some point.]			"

												One of the best games I've played in quite some time. I've only done the single player campaign, but there are three more modes... vs, co op, and 2 v 1 (a sort of boss battle, if I understand, called Nemesis Battles). It's extremely fast- paced. There's no pausing, even though it's ostensibly a turn based sorta game, so you've got to think fast to make the most of your cards. Love the setting, and deck building is very difficult due to being limited to 20 cards (and I've already unlocked 69). Everything about this game is choose wisely... and if you buy it, you'll have chosen well indeed.			"

												An indie game by the same people who made SpaceChem. The backdrop for the game is a steampunk version of the American Civil War, with both sides using robots called Ironclads to try to win the day. The gameplay is like a cross between Heroes of Might and Magic and a Collectible Card Game.Mastering which cards to include in your deck for each level is key -- the right deck will get you through a level without too much pain. The wrong deck will make you want to hurl your computer out the window.The concept was excellent and the execution is fantastic. Buy this game.			"

												Great game! Feels a little like a combo/remix of Plants vs Zombies and sitting down with a friend to play 1989's ""North & South.""  The beautifully drawn comic-book style story panels are a nice touch, although with just a little more refinement the plot/writing could have really shined.  Doesn't get in the way of a delightful game, however.  I thoroughly recommend this game to both tactical and CCG fans, as well as the curious who would like to dip their toe into either genre.			"

												This game is astounding! I'm not a fan of card games at all. I generally dislike all of them. But this game is really fun. The gameplay is really tactical, you do need to THINK about what you're doing and what you want to do. It is not always easy, but it is never impossible. The best part is that there is always more than one way to win a level, it's all about combining cards, deciding a strategy, creating a good deck, and using that deck to it's best potential. There is a small amount of luck involved, but not much. If you're not winning, you should probably change your deck composition. PSThe soundtrack is really really good! :D			"

												Boy was I wrong not to try this game sooner. I love Civil War history, so I thought this would be up my alley. However, I've shied away from tabletop card games in the past. This was the supposed marriage of the two. I bought it in a Humble Bundle, then installed on it and sat on it for a few months. I finally fired it up and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't exactly ""playing cards via a video game"" but a bit more than that. It's more fast pace than a tabletop would be, with the computer setting the moves at an even pace. I've only played the campaign thus far, and have very much enjoyed it. I wonder how the online multi-player would be if/when I play it.			"

												Quite possibly the best dual player gaming epxerience of 2013. When I first discovered Ironclad Tactics I immediately rushed to inform my gaming partner that there was a ""2 player, co-op, real-time, tactical, card based, RPG on steam...that also runs on Mac"". He said ""oh you and your crazy lies. Let me guess, it's probably about steam powered battle robots in, oh, i dunno, the american civil war"". I said ""Yeah! And there's a cat with a monacle!"".I haven't been this satisfied with a game in a long while. It's fast, it's fun, it's challenging, it's rewarding and best of all it's cooperative. I cannot stress enough how much more satisfying it is to overcome obstacles and challanges with a partner than by yourself and the co-op system in this game is absolutely masterful. My partner and I would frequently take the opportunity to build complimentary decks, taking turns filling specific roles and amplifying each other strengths, or, compensating for each others weaknesses. The game features a beautifully executed diffiulty curve, with challenges that constantly demand new decks and new strategies and always feels just slightly harder than you're capable of. So, when you manage to beat that level and all of its challenges, that accomplishment actually means something. Not a lot of games deliver that kind of satisfaction.The only real criticism I can give to Ironclad Tactics is that it's short and the multiplayer doesnt hold a lot of interest for me due to its limited versatility. In a 1-on-1 match, there are only so many viable card combinations and with no new cards coming out the game has serious mortality issues. But all good things must come to an end, right?Great game, awesome multiplayer, it was well worth the cost.			"

												Ironclad Tactics was found to be a surprisingly fun and addictive game.Play can be described as a Plants vs. Zombies' lane combat, in a versus mode, minus the tower defense aspects.The gameplay mechanics are unique.  There are two phases/modes to the game:  A sort of deck builder lite, where players construct decks to be used during gameplay.  And the actual gameplay phase, where actions and units are played through a card based mechanic in real time (no pausing).  The real time action forces the player to think and act quickly, as flow combat dynamically shifts the player between attack and defense as needed.While the luck of the draw, or the real time play aspect of the game, might turn some off, I found it to be a bit addictive, evoking that ""just one more round"" type of play progression.An added bonus is the comic book like story progression between levels.  I found the artwork and storyline to be quite enjoyable.With the base game alone, I would suggest people give it a try.  Single player, new game plus, and multi player modes are available.  I am looking forward to digging into the DLC.I just need to give that last level in my ng+ one more shot.  Cheers!  =)*** Touch Based Users ***Those with touch screen computers should note that this game played perfectly with the touch screen option enabled in the options menu.  The only minor issue was with naming the decks in the deck builder, but that interfered with the game in no way.*** Cloud Saves ***This game supports cloud saves. (Great!!!)*** Cross Compatibility ****The cloud saves in this game worked with cross compatibility between both PC and Mac. (Awesome!!!) "

												Ironclad tatics is a turn based cards strategy game based on a alternate version of the Civil war (no doubt you can already guess that due to the look of the game). I've seen alot of negative reviews for the game and to be honest, even though I would recommend this game, I don't think it's as good as some people think it is. First thing first, the good aspects of the game:+ Incredible music, I'm still listening to the music and hell even the dlc music are actually better than the main music. Thankfully the soundtrack is free if you google it and is actually from the musician himself.+ Artwork, while cartoony, it's pretty great. I enjoy the designs for the characters and landscape and the movement is pretty smooth.+ Diversity, the game offers alot of cards and a total of 5 (+3 if you have the 2 dlc) that have different types of weapons, troops and tactics. So those are some of the good aspects, what is it that I don't like?-Luck, Despite being a turned based strategy game with cards, the game is 100% dependent on getting luck. There will be times that you will have to reconsider which deck you use but even if you have the right deck, the starting hand, timing and chances your opponent won't try to destroy you early in the match is pretty harsh and can put off alot of people.-Story, I don't really hate the story much but to be honest, the characters could have been better. Often times I kinda felt the main character should have been another character, some characters don't feel like we know them too well or changes too quick.- Limitation, Knowing this is on pc, the game still feels limited to being a mobile game. You can only have max of 4 decks  and can only have max of 20 cards and 2 factions per deck. This can be very frustrating if you want to get your favorite cards together only to either exceeded the limits. (I know how I felt about not getting my army of native flamethrowing/Drilling/tomahawk army)-Challanges (Mission challange), um yea, I'm not gonna be able to beat that one level without breaking the walls........Overall, why am I recommending the game? 3 reasons: the music is fantastic, it's a alternate historical game that acutally doesn't suck and it's actually makes you feel like you want to really win battles.

'Tactics?'Why the game has ""Tactics"" in the title is a mystery to all.It certainly gives the wrong impression which is a huge shame because I went in expecting a deep tactical role playing game and what I got instead was Megaman Battle Network.Now those were a good series of games! Following in their footsteps this game should at least be decent, right?Megaman Battle Network?Well yeah, it is decent actually but for some reason they decided to make a hybrid between 'Megaman Battle Network' and 'Plants VS Zombies' so what you end up with is a not very good 'lane' game ala PvZ and a watered down MBN game which just leaves you disoriented. Battle network was good! If you are going to emulate an already good game then try to copy the parts that actually made it good, switching my robots from lane to lane using cards is unnatural in a fast paced game and also i have to click twice to switch lanes and sometimes it just doesn't register that I want it to move out the way.Plants VS Zombies?The PvZ element is a little overdone in clone games but what do you expect, that game sold very well so I wouldn't mind the hybridization the developer attempted here if they didn't try to make you move robots up & down the lanes/battlefield when most victories are about out spamming your foe in PvZ and thinking on your feet. This game is just too fast paced to be able to keep up with everything that is expected of you.Ironclad Fail?Ultimately we have a good game here but it is very much NOT for everyone. You can play the story mode with a friend, the art direction is simple but good, the story telling is decent and the depth comes from learning to juggle the megaman aspects against the PvZ aspects, knowing which units are worth your concentration and effort versus which ones to just leave as cannon fodder and the music, the sound it is all really good and I haven't even mentioned the deck building either which lets you create dynamic tactics and builds.Ultimately if you are expecting a tactical game in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre then no, this is NOT that kind of game but if you were a fan of the Megaman Battle Network games or the Plants VS Zombies then this game might be for you.Personally I didn't enjoy this game hence why I didn't recommend it but I apprechiate that not only is the game itself well done and polished but also that it was very ambitious to attempt to combine two great franchaises.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												Whilst I admit to not being smart enough to complete space chem I did really enjoy the process and it didn't at any point feel unfair, the fault was mine alone for not getting it. Unfortunately this game at times feels unfair to an extent where I have got to a stage where even after looking up guides for it they all seem to surmount in, better luck next time. Clearly like any deck  building game you should make a deck that minimises the chances of RNG but also like any deck building game you can just get unlucky. Don't get me wrong if there was a maybe recommendation I would have used that but I personally did not like this, if you like deck building games this will probably still be something you can enjoy but it is so fast passed that it feels like a spam fest at times.

												I've been playing Ironclad Tactics off and on for a big time Only now, after earning lot's card, I realize that I forgot to write a review. The pace is realtime, but it moves slow enough to allow some thinking time for your next moves. Most of the challenge comes from building specialized decks to solve the puzzle that each level presents. Your AI opponent will have the upper hand with some new attack or defense and you’ll have to come up with a counter. Most of the time this results in a tense battle of planning, wits, and fortune. When you tweak a deck combo into working just right it feels great! Each new card opens up lots of tactical options and completing challenges for cards feels rewarding.The civil war theme and story are awesome. I love the characters and animated comics that set up you journey across America. The in-game art and animation is beautiful. It’s easy to tell every unit apart and their abilities match the visuals. A robot with a jetpack files, dude with a shotgun has spread attack, and a flame thrower hits multiple targets. .Each level starts by showing you 5 random cards from your deck of 20, so sometimes it feels like a lucky/unlucky start can make or break a win. If cards come out in just the wrong order it can kill a plan, but managing this problem is also part of the art of deck building. It improved a bit with the release of the first DLC where you can now spend 1 action point to ‘save’ a critical card for later.The first DLC uses an army with a completely different and fun style of play. It’s satisfying playing as the boss enemies that were beating you down in the final levels and to understanding the logic behind how their robots transform. It also fills in missing parts of the story with more comics. Not every ability or tactic is perfectly balanced, but there’s lots of viable strategies to solve each problem. That said, I haven’t played multiplayer which would be a much better gauge of balance. There’s not enough players to support random matchmaking and I don’t feel like it would be that fun against friends (even if they unlocked all the cards). I also haven’t tried the co-op mode, which is supported throughout the entire game but I think it would be pretty fun!UPDATE:I have bough both of the dlcs before june 20th and really want a refund while keeping the dlcs but I won't be fussy with them because well that's a bit mean. I honestly think this game if put on more consoles would change the market a bit in the world of turn based games.			"

												I found this game to be pretty fun. The card-based summoning/creation of units appealed to me, and it is a strategy tactical type of game. If you've ever played any flash game with a set number of rows your units have to cross to get to the other side to win, that's this game. The difference between this game and a normal flash game? Better graphics, better sound effects, and a great comic style story telling. The game lacked in voice acting, it was mainly the units being summoned/created when voice acting came into play. It also misses a feature I would have loved to see, which is a speed up button. It made the game a little boring sometimes having to wait for the right card or just something else. It would have been a nice feature (1.5 times to 2x would have been perfect).Ironclad Tactics has a multiplayer feature that I have yet to take part in (not a huge MP fan on some games), but it is probably pretty similar to the campaign so it is probably pretty solid.Overall: 8/10 for a simple, but fun tactical strategy game.My recommendation: Buy it on at a discounted price/on sale.

												I felt the need to evalute this game after reading most of the negative feedback in the recommendations, mostly from people giving up on it because of how hard the game is. True the game is frustrating, but I found looking for each level's solution quite challenging, rewarding, and eventually quite fun. Having deck building elements, it'll require you to figure out which cards are good and which ones are bad, and test your decks, several times if needed. Kind of like those games such as Metal gear Acid or PSOIII, which I personally loved.         The art and story are also amazing, which is a strong reason to hang on and complete the whole game.Typically this is the type of game which you can rapidly be disappointed in, and a demo would really profit everybody imo, so I'd recommend you try it beforehand, one way or another. If you're the impatient type, you can safely pass on that game though.			"

												It's a card-based strategy game that runs in realtime, where armies of retro robots march across a grid-based map as players spend action points on the cards that arm them, move them, repair them, and introduce new units to the fray. The campaign can be played co-operatively, with a few bonus objectives in missions requiring two friends to battle each other and there is a random 1-versus-1 option where you will be matched against an opponent over the web.Game: 8.0/10Graphic: 8.5/10100% Achievement : Easy | Medium | Hard | Very Hard			"

												Brilliant card deck strategy game.Use your Ironclads and soldiers to beat a civil war in the USA.For each move you have action and move points. The game field is quite limited (mostly 5x8 squares) So you have to figure out the right tactic. After every mission your success is awarded with an extra story comic strip. Later you can build your own card decks or beat missions with infinite card dropping. Tip: Use pause button on your Ironclads to stand them. Tip2: You can repair your Ironclads.			"

												I was looking forward to trying this game a while back, although I had no clue it came from Zachtronics, developer of the infamous SpaceChem. I haven't played much of SpaceChem yet. It intimidates me, and I'd like to devote my full attention to it, when the time comes -- soon, I'd say.So, when I knew this came from the same people, I wasn't sure if I wanted to play yet. I did anyway.Well, Ironclad Tactics is a different take on the lane strategy ""genre"", with the added complexity layer of deck-building.This game is really, if you don't know what you're expected to do. This is mostly a deck-building game, as other reviewers have stated. Each level has a different challenge for your to overcome, and you overcome it with a different deck, mostly. Certainly, tactics are also very important, but a good tactic will do very little if you don't have the correct deck.While the concept is interesting, and I did enjoy the game, I can't say that it's perfect. At all. It has several design points that I heartily disagree with, and make it simply a ""good"" game. Which isn't bad, mind you. Just not quite what I expected after trying SpaceChem.I've completed the game (without the DLC). Done all the optional objectives as well as game plus. It was a challenging task, for sure, but also very rewarding!Each level has a main objective. There are several different types of levels: there's the common level, in which you try to get victory points by moving your units into the end of the map, there's an ""hold position"" level, in which you try to survive for x number of turns, and there's the Boss levels. Each of them play very different. Level variation is also pretty good, which is surprising. It seems very limited with the 3-5 lane maps, but there is a surprising number of subtle changes that make all the different. Then, there are optional objectives. Some are puzzle levels -- these were easy, but really great! Basically, they teach you a certain mechanic with that: limited deck with 3 or 4 cards, and you have to make the best out of it. Unfortunately, there were only 3 or 4 of these levels.Then, there are some that make you gain VP by other means than moving units to the end of the lane. There are some that make you play with a completely different deck: don't use Y faction, for example.All of these provide interesting challenges.Now, what's wrong with it, exactly?Well, you unlock cards by completing levels and secondary objectives. However, since this is such a deck-oriented game, you'll often be missing the cards you need for a given deck. And so, you have to push through some challenges, until you can go back and complete the secondary objectives. It has a very awkward pacing, like that. Some game encourage you to play previous levels better, but this one does that weirdly, since you can only play some of the previous levels better, since you're missing cards.You'll have to go back and forth a few times, but it's doable. Just not as elegant as I would have liked.Then, there's the random elements. Argh, the randomness...!So, you build a deck. Great. Then, you have to hope that you draw the correct cards at the right moments. One bad draw can screw you over and make you restart a level. Oh, but wait: there's no restart button! I'll talk about it later.Yeah, lots of restarting, until you get the right draws. It's... not to my liking. Maybe it works in multiplayer. It certainly works in most card game. But here, it's just a matter of restarting... Tactics play a lesser role than the actual cards used, and that's why the randomness doesn't work as well.Also, the decks are very limited -- maximum of 2 factions, exactly 20 cards. So, you can't really create as much variety, or even guarantee to get a certain card, since there are at most 4 or 5 of each. It's an interesting limitation, and it requires some creativity to beat levels. But then again, the randomness is frustating, since it's a matter of trying over and over until you get the right draws that you envisioned all along.Now, about the lack of a restart button. I don't know why it is. It makes little sense. Perhaps it's simply a question of the designer saying ""create the right deck and you won't have to restart"". Maybe...The game came off as a bit too random for that, but I don't know. Just a minor gripe made bigger with the amount of restarting...Honestly, this is a very frustrating game, at times. Especially when you first start, not exactly sure how it works, it will be daunting. But if you keep trying, you'll learn how the game works, how the AI works, and how certain levels can be easily beat with the right decks.NewGame+ is almost a whole different game, also! Don't just complete the main campaign, thinking that's everything. It's definitely not.Well, not a perfect game, but certainly a very rewarding experience, if you feel like a challenge!			"

												So this is a strange strategy/tower defense-ish game thing where you create a ""card deck"" of units and abilities that you use to fight battles against your opponent. It's more complex than that, and as you progress through the single-player campaign you get access to more card that allow more variety in your playing style.It's not really my sort of game, but it is decent enough so I can't just give this a no and walk away. Hopefully other people can have fun with it. :3			"

When making decks get lots of the guys wearing fezzes, they're hard to kill as if you only shoot them once they have armor so it wont do anything, and he will pick up and put his fez back on. Their only weakness is multiple enemies shooting him at once, or gettig stepped on by an Ironclad.			"

												Genre - Strategy lane game with cardsThis is one of those games where you have to throw your units against your enemies on the other side of the screen hoping they get through, whilst they do the same to you. This is done by activating cards at varying cost that you collect as you play the game. Some units are better suited against others and you can get some cards to move units, heal and damage. On paper this sounds quite fun. However, I am not a big fan of these lane games as I find them quite boring. True the cards add a new element but just throwing units at the enemy hoping hey get through whilst they do the same doesn't keep my interest. Also I don't know if I am just crap at this game but I tend to lose quite a few games on a level before I get the win and this seems mainly down to luck. The idea of the American civil war with steam powered Mechs is a cool concept though. Basically if you like lane fighting games, you will like this. If you don't, you will think it is a good example of the genre but still won't like it.			"

												I was really only interested in this game because it's from the designer of Spacechem, which for my money is bar none the greatest puzzle game of all time, and my non-recommendation is really directed towards fans of that game who aren't familiar with ""card"" games like Ironclad.The most important differences between the two (which I understand are from two different genres) are:1) You don't know if you have the tools you need to finish the current level. Although it's probably entirely possible to work your way through the game without ever going back to complete the story challenge objectives, you might find it difficult without those extra cards. (Whereas in Spacechem you only have what you're given in each level. You aren't collecting tools along the way.)2) Beat the clock - although the game is turn-based, you have to keep track of a number of game elements and make your plays in a fairly brief window of time. (Whereas in Spacechem only the boss fights have a time element and that only has to do with execution, not designing your reactors.)3) Luck of the draw - It's annoying to have a well planned deck fail multiple times, then finally succeed when you get the cards in a reasonable order. I don't mind losing to AI, but losing to the random number generator is irritating. (Whereas in Spacechem the only apparent randomness is in some of the reactor inputs, but the point is your design needs to detect and handle each case appropriately.)If the above game design elements don't bother you, then you should give Ironclad a look. It's certainly a more polished work than Spacechem, but unfortunately it doesn't require anything like the intense problem solving that Spacechem does. (But for some people that might be a plus.) I don't regret my purchase since the money went to Zachtronics, but I didn't get nearly as much value out of this game as I did from Spacechem. (Go buy Spacechem.)			"

												This game is very unique, starts of with nice comic strip funny cutscenes, and has gameplay thats a mix of TCG and realtime 4 row cardplay!Unfortunately even with the right choices and deck , LUCK plays a huge role.After a while you ll probably restart a round after first 2 turns go bad.With the added expansions it has much variety and cards but is always plaqued by randomness preventing it from being a brilliant tactical game.Also the computer always has an unfair advantage on you.Lastly the tutorial is lacking badly.

												I really wanted to like Ironclad Tactics. The animations are charming and the Steampunk Civil War setting is way cool. But after two hours of gameplay I just couldn't get into the combat system. This might be, in part, because of my hatred for CCG-style mechanics (I hate the idea that your options are limited by what cards you draw, and especially the idea that you have to earn abilities by jumping through whatever hoops you have to to earn cards). Charming as it is, the mechanics struck me as couter-intiuitive, and I didn't have any fun palying it.			"

												I really want to love this game, but it's too slow, too random, and just generally feels clunky.  Your ability to make strategic decisions is severely hampered by the limited cards available at any one time, and you initial draw can utterly hose you for an entire map, especially if there are control points on the board.

												Isn't for me.. Comic book and nothing but talking scenes and has to be reed. You pick your prototype card and put him in one of the rows and then he stops cause theres something in his way so you destroy it or go around and you get cards (points) for it. Very slow for me and comic book scenes don't help but good luck to whomever buys this.oh and the prototype will pause in each block he moves up to for 5 or 10 seconds or so so its not fast at all so it's a slow paced kind of game.

												Zachtronics puts out some really cool games. I *really* wanted to fall in love with this one, I even bought it the day it came out (as well as the DLC), but overall I have a negative opinion at the end of the day.Pros:+Cool artwork aesthetic+The real-time card based action is great+Deckbuilding!+DLC!!! (which I still bought to support the developer)+Storyline is cuteMeh:-+Music is fitting enough, but does not really standoutCon:-Waaayyyyy too difficult. I know only having one 'con' and still giving a thumbs down sounds silly, but this is a major deal-breaker for me with this game. I spent plenty of time trying to git gud, but let me tell you this game is beyond brutal. This mainly goes for the single player campaign, but also for multiplayer match-ups. This game is so difficult that it completely turns me off from trying for the third or fourth time.I am certainly up for a challenge (Real Platinum God here) - just look at the games I mostly play. I just never felt like I was either learning how to get better, or even progressing at all. I will add that I completed the storyline on basic mode (or whatever its called).  "

												It's fun... but the game would be alot more fun in multiplayer, which nobody ever plays. The campaign gets old after awhile because it feels puzzle based, which means you need to build your decks differently for each level if you want to do well; a game based on deck building mechanics, however, tends to make you want to build around your theme rather than the theme of the level.The story is ok, it does its job, but, i feel like it doesnt give enough personality to the ""colors"" of the deck, ie: the indians, etc.This comes really close to being awesome in a few different ways, but it doesnt quite get there. If its on sale, grab it... otherwise just wishlist it.			"

												 Ironclad tactics is a card-driven lane strategy game within a steampunk version of the american civil war era. You and your opponent each have a deck of 20 cards. By using these decks you try to send several Ironclads (steampunk mech-like things) to the opponent's side of the battle in order to win.  The visuals of the game is quite striking, the campaign keeps you interested with the game, and the mechanics are also praiseworthy. However, the game fails in the level designs. Starting from halfway around the game, you play against very strictly formed decks and all you have to do is play against the deck, learn its advantages & disadvantages by being defeated, form a deck specific for the current opponent, and beat him. Your victorious deck has limited use in the next battle, so you must repeat the steps above in every battle you have. The AI is also very straighforward. It repeats the same tactic over & over again.			"

												Ironclad Tactics is the best combination of turn-based strategy and card game I've played in quite the long while. There are few words that describe the tension as you hope amongst hope that the next card you get is the one you desperately need. It's easy to believe in the Heart of the Cards with this game. That being said, the random element does sometimes work against you so build your deck wisely. The story is fairly deep and quiet heartwarming. All-in-all, give it a shot.			"

												The late game difficulty spikes were frustrating because of the random nature of card drawing games. But besides a few annoying battles, I really dug this game. It is like Plants vs Zombies, but both sides are zombies. But it's cooler than PVZ because you have mechs! The art style and setting are interesting and original, the deck building is fun and simple, and the gameplay is solid. These elements combine and set this game above other run-of-the-meal tower defense/strategy/card drawing games .			"

												So far so good! This game is much better than I thought it would be. It's a tactical ccg game along the vein of Plants Vs. Zombies.You and an opponent take turns moving your guys across the screen and attacking once per turn, using your AP (that accrue each turn) to do things like heal or equip.You can put a cat with a monocle on the heads of your mecha.I'm just putting that out there.

												I actually downloaded this game as steam is currently giving it away as free for a limited time and i thought to myself ""Why the heck not?"" So i downloaded this yesterday and i played this game for about 30 minutes, I enjoyed it a lot. Lemme tell you that i am not a Strategy game playing kinda guy. I don't usually play these type of games pretty often, so i didn't really get my hopes up that much, after playing it a while i think that this game has a lot of potential. I love the gameplay and the interface looks really cool, i also like how they represent the story in a cool comic styled way. Basically what i'm trying to say is, if it is still available on steam, or you're looking for a nice indie game for a couple of bucks to pass the time, this game is for you.This game looks pretty simplistic but actually after a while you'll see that you need to keep calm and play wisely, the tactics you make can't be used all the time because of limitations like AP and the cards. One time i won without a sweat and on the next one i lost miserably. This game gets pretty challenging sometimes and its a good thing, makes it fun to play.10/10 would play again.			"

												Great game BUT WAY TOO SHORT!I feel like I'd just finished the tutorial and then it ended. I know I know.. there is DLC but I want to play a full campaign of a game before i start shelling out for more of it. So far I've resisted buying any more of it mainly for feeling a little ripped off with such a short single player.I played some of the multiplayer and found that every opponent was using the exact same deck of cards and tactics. It made me question the games balance in that respect too. Perhaps a little disapointing but worth a few quid.			"

Maybe in some DLC we will see this, who knows.The game itself is a lot of fun the unlocksystem and the not-so-easy difficulty will have you scream at times when you want to do ""too much"" ^^You need to be fast and keep up with the tactics, the slower you are the more the tactics part will drop out for you makeing you loose in sp and mp but this also can be fun. You just don´t have the time for perfect moves and 2 hours mp games but need to be clever and fast.You can build your own decks!Overall a 7,5/10 for me (if they would add a turn based mode 9/10 even without knowing how the balace will sufer from new cards).

												The way that Ironclad Tactics does it's co-op multiplayer in the campaign is like nothing I've ever seen before.  It is difficult to describe, but I will try my best.  This game is a 2d, turn based, real time stratagy.  During the first phase of the turn each player (bot or human) playes their cards and the actions take place.  Once that phase is over all of the characters perform their actions and moves.Full control over your teammates units (This makes for some very interesting stratagies)Both players need to make decks that work with eachother. (you will not have a chance if you don't)Split second desicions must be made because turns go quickly and both sides are playing actions at onceIronclad tactics is very fun  co-op with a friend and has cool gameplay that stays fresh.  You will have to change your deck almost every level in order to counter what the next one has to offer (This really keeps the game interesting)I would also like to mention how well done the artwork for the comic is.If you have a friend and enjoy this type of game I would 100% reccomend picking this up and playing it with them!

												I played this game for free and enjoyed myself. The game is a card game in which you need to win a certain amount of victory points by having key units exit the map on the enemies side.. of course the enemy tries to do the same with his  key unit exiting of your side of the map. Next to the units which you summon with the appropiate cards, you have cards that enhance them or allow them to do special moves. Some cards are tied in with a special units. You can design your own deck with the cards so that you can play the game the way you want, although sometimes you are forced to play with a certain deck.. especially when you want to win bonus cards or solve puzzles. I followed the story mode until I got stuck and discovered that next to the story mode there are other options to win additional cards and units. The end battle I found particular hard to win. The game is a kind of a mixed bag. On the one hand it is fun game with a nice visual style and mood. The art design is cartoony which is well chosen as it fits well the mood of the game.  The story mode is told via cartoons, which I found captivating at first, but near to the end I started to click through to get to the battle. The makers made a wise choice not to force players to sit through a story every time they are defeated  and have to replay it again and I think I even gained cards when I was defeated.The  other hand, the down side, is that the game remains a random card game and it isn't easy to build a tactic around it.  In addition you get often thrown into a unknown situation with no clue about what you are up against, so that you might find yourself losing because you simple have the wrong cards and units to defeat the challenge. Especially the end battle is heavily dependent on luck.. if you luck out you lose, if you luck holds you win.In addition I don't quite understand why the makers chose to split the cards up in groups of which you can only have two at the same time. At least one group has no units and another consists mostly of units that are into sneaking and have no use in a regular fight. Why this limitation has been introduced remains a mystery as you are limited to 20 cards and I can't think of a combination of cards that would make someone invincible.. but maybe you can..Anyway.. would I recommend it..Well, yes.. for a short while.

												Solid game. I was hesitant on the card aspect of the game, but it's actually a fair mechanic and the turn-based strategy of the game is interesting. Plays like a tug-of-war where you send units to the enemy side to score Victory Points. Variety of cards do different things, like summon units or equip said units with weapons to kill enemy units. Turns resolve fully before the next, so if you and your opponent both have 1 HP and a 1 attack weapon, both units will die in the same turn. Removes the turn advantage you seen in many other card games.Haven't tried multiplayer because I hate multiplayer games, but the single player campaign is still well done.			"

												A very fast-paced Rts game. It had a very good comic book style story, and very well designed game mechanics. This game made me rage incredibly hard at certain points, but thats not entirly the games fault. Overall a nice game to play if youve got nothing else to do (plus theres multiplayer)			"

												First Impressions: Graphical style is solid, albeit, not amazing, but - good. Fits the theme, and makes me think very much of Penny Arcade in the drawing style, which is a positve.Then, oh my, the game itself. It's a little... weird. I've never really played these kind of things online, but having been a huge M:TG fan way way back when, it's definately got a good spin on the idea. I dislike the idea of having such a limited pool of cards to play with. I can totally understand limiting the selection of cards so you have to have at least 20, but so far (and I don't know if this changes during the game later on) you're stuck with just twenty, and that's not a positive. We've all these wonderful combinations that we just can't do due to limited deck size. That's one major downside to the deck building aspect, but such is life - and it's not terrible, just would have preferred more wiggle room in that department.In terms of strategy, seems quite simple, until you try and achieve some of the challenges - which make luck/rush a bit more of a factor, but they're fun to go for. Although there are times I wish I could freeze my cards from cycling, again, because of rng. But I do enjoy the timed aspects of the turn based system, making it simulataneous makes a huge difference to how it feels, and makes it much more actiony.I can definately see me letting my boy play this, as he loves Pokemon et all, and this seems a little more grown-up in terms of game, but he's starting to get into them.Cons:- It's random past your deckbuilding. If you're not a player of those type of games, this might frustrate you.         - Some of the starts you get, where you're outmatched immediately are frustrating, especially with random luck.         - It's a little simplistic. Doesn't have some of the same depth you may be used to if you're familiar to the format.         - While I've not played the game to death yet, although I can see myself enjoying this later on, I suspect it will feel very samey aftera while.Pros:- It's cheap and while there's DLC, it doesn't have the spend spend spend attitude of many of the trading card style of games.        - If you enjoy tcg's, then you'll find the game quite intuitive, apart from the turns flying by if you're a ""muller over of things"".        - Graphics are nice, and the story so far seems interesting and for what few words there are, well written.        - Easy to get into, just from a short play time, I can see myself getting into this a lot more.Simple, cheap and quite a lot of fun. Can't go wrong with steam powered mecha.			"

Despite 15+ hours worth of content, it's so good it left me wanting for more. Bring on the expansions!			"

												The late game difficulty spikes were frustrating because of the random nature of card drawing games. But besides a few annoying battles, I really dug this game. It is like Plants vs Zombies, but both sides are zombies. But it's cooler than PVZ because you have mechs! The art style and setting are interesting and original, the deck building is fun and simple, and the gameplay is solid. These elements combine and set this game above other run-of-the-meal tower defense/strategy/card drawing games .			"

												This is really fun and quirky, but it is not super-great. The main bit of strategy depth comes from making a deck, which is basically making your army. The deck-creator system is just what you'd expect, and works well. In addition, there are plenty of opportunities for specific challenges, requiring different decks.The main problem is that it is a short game. There just isn't too much to do. Unless you really want to get 100% completion, it is over with quickly.			"

												I'm not usually a fan of CCGs, but as a huge fan of strategy, the Civil War, and steampunk, I loved Ironclad Tactics. It's fun, to put it simply.The pacing of a match is sufficient where you can plan without being rushed, but you don't have to wait a long time. The variety of cards and factions means that you can focus on different tactics, and have many unique decks without old cards becoming obsolete. And of course, who wouldn't want to command an army of giant robots?There were a couple foibles, though. The first cards had an interesting mechanic where completing mini-achievements would unlock new cards (e.g. deploying 30 riflemen--->veteran riflemen). This is really only seen in the first few missions and then not really at all from there on out. A shame, considering that hey, it was a cool idea. The basic story was okay; not great, but not terrible. The characters were unique, but not really memorable. I thought one particular character, Joseph Ashdown, should have been in the story a bit more, given that he's the main character's lifelong friend and shares equal billing with him. He kind of gets kicked out of the story early on, and doesn't show up again till near the end. But that's only my opinion.All in all, though, I'd still totally recommend Ironclad Tactics. It's a pretty solid choice, with a vibrant, unique art style, a really, really great sort of American-orchestral soundtrack, and quite a lot of post-main-story fun (including a harder version of the campaign and two DLC campaigns), Ironclad Tactics is a stable ride that just needs some polish. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.			"

I know I know.. there is DLC but I want to play a full campaign of a game before i start shelling out for more of it. So far I've resisted buying any more of it mainly for feeling a little ripped off with such a short single player.I played some of the multiplayer and found that every opponent was using the exact same deck of cards and tactics. It made me question the games balance in that respect too. Perhaps a little disapointing but worth a few quid.			"

												Ironclad Tactics is as genuine as a card game can be. If you're up for some serious single player strategy challenge, and if you can handle the excitement of a short turn timer, IC:T is the game for you. Be aware that this is a small game (well worth $15 though) but it offers a whole new unique genre that can be explored in the future. Yes there will be expansions but also I'm 100% sure there will be other games from other companies that follow IC:T's path. If you want to play a game that starts a genre, here's your chance.Pros:Fun and challenging levelsInnovative & originalCool art & storyThe possibility to develop in the futureNo micro transactions (nothing can be bought in-game)Co-op mode with a friendCons:Thanks to the non-existent PVP lounge, PVP didn't really happen except the 1st month. If you want the PVP cards, you will need a friend to log in with you.			"

												This game will require a constant change of tactics because the AI is always overpowered.Challenging, yes, but the AI always plays cards you have yet to earn and this is sometimes frustrating. In later stages the AI is playing epic cards and you'll lose a few games in order to complete it after you changed your deck a few times.But sometimes it's really luck based or you lose just right before completion.
