												It is a fun game where you play as a dragon and collect treasure from towns and fields. The more treasure you collect the more you can upgrade the attributes of your dragon. Each map takes 10 minutes, so it is good if you are short on time. Would be nice if there a story mode to the game. But very fun game.			"

												Dragons.  The stuff of horrible, malicious slander and propaganda.  You hear it all the time.  They ""hoard gold"", ""burn villages"", ""eat princesses"", they ""must be slain for the good of the people.""  People brag about their dragonslaying prowess.  Showing a brutal murder of a dragon on TV barely merits a wink from standards and practices departments.  In a world where games like Skyrim and movies like The Hobbit glorify violence against dragonkind, it's good to see someone had the sense to portray a more balanced look at the situation.  In Hoard, you play as a dragon going about daily life while being hunted by cruel, vicious knights, seeking the companionship of fair princesses, acting as the local neighborhood watch by dealing with petty thieves said knights don't bother arresting, keeping unslightly crops from littering the landscape, preventing traffic problems, and other clearly benign acts.  In return, you have to survive the prejudiced assault of said knights, archers, powerful wizards, and trolls who want to kill you on sight.  This game is a poweful lesson in tolerance toward those who are different and scalier, and maybe could use a cool, refreshing breath mint once in awhile.			"

												Simple game concept, you fly around with a dragon, destroy wagons with gold, kidnapp princesses and collect everything you get in your 'lair'. While doing so you need to protect your lair from thieves and enemy dragons. To be able to better do this you can level up your dragon when collecting enough gold on a per game basis (does not persist between games). This game definately plays better with a controller and is designed with multiplayer in mind. While the game may get boring playing alone once you've tried every mode and possibly even before you've played every map at least once it's fun for a long time in multiplayer. The (up until now) two DLCs bring more elements to the game along side a good load of new maps which extends the gameplay quite a bit.			"

												Yeah, HOARD is a fun game. I enjoy it a great deal. Nearly everything about the game is amazing. However, the developers made some glaring omissions when it came to this game. While these omissions do not diminish the game completely...they stop it from being a truly awesome title. These omissions are: * Ability to turn off the timer, in order to have open ended games. * Ability to set up a game how you want to play it. Units, buildings, # of dragons. Instead it's set up with predefined scenarios. Out of these two, the first one is really the downer here. I feel like, things are really getting fun around the 9 minute mark, only to have the game end at 10 mins. If you can look past that though, and are not a stickler for sandbox type features...HOARD is still a very very fun game.			"

												This is a fun little casual game.It wont last everybody hours and hours as the gameplay is relatively repetitive, but it is a nice addition to a collection if you like scoring type games, like those old arcade games, orcs must die or the like.  Nevertheless, it is a great game if you have a few minutes to kill for a quick multiplay or single play action as it doesnt drain the comp's ram after quitting or alt tabbing if you are sitting in front of low end specs.In the end though, its not worth the $10, but defintely worth grabbing if on a good special or part of a bundle.

												Hoard is basically a few minigames with one overall theme: you are a dragon, and must complete certain objectives.On some maps, you'll need to gather a set amount of gold. On others, you'll need to ransom princesses, or survive a certain amount of time.Unfortunately, there is very little to Hoard's gameplay. Left click to breath fire, right click to power-up and use wasd to move the dragon. This makes the game incredibly difficult to recommend at 11.5$.The game is also rather easy; the AI dragons will always let you backstab them for early gold, and keep them down throughout the matches. Either get the complete package in a sale, or skip it entirely, but it just doesn't have enough to be worth 11.5$. Don't get the game without the DLC, because it's not really worth it; the dynamite carts are the most fun you'll have past the first hour or two.			"

												Mario is pretty mad I stole 50 princesses from the castles. Oh wait, im a dragon! GameplayHoard really has a interesting idea of just looting as much gold as you can from either destruction, stealing, or fetching princesses. You basically select what area to play in and can travel back and forth across it, but becomes increasingly difficult as more towers spawn to shoot at you and more heros also come out to attack you for stealing the princess.  Like bullet hell games but with a twist of staying on a grid with the ability to go back and forth at will. There is various game modes like time trials, survival, race the other dragons to X amount of gold. There is DLC for more modes i believe but I have not actually tried them.MultiplayerThere is multiplayer but I have had no luck in finding people to actually play with. So I cant really say much about that, but since there is AI you can fight against I suppose it makes up for the lack of online people. Not sure if I would recommend this game at full price seeing as how for me its more like a game you pick up and play every now and then in short bursts for fun.			"

Game details:Published by : Big Sandwich GamesDeveloped by  : Big Sandwich GamesGenre  : casual/indie/strategy/action DRAGONS!Release date  : 4th April 2011HOARD is a short, birds eye perspective, simple board style game where your sole purpose is to be a loot hungry colorful dragon that flies around, uses firebreath to burn down farms, mills, towns, trade carts and towers. With each thing you burn, you collect gold which you carry back to your lair to gain points. Not only that, but you get to kill knights and kidnap princesses. How awesome is that? The aim of the game is to get as many points as possible in the ten minutes time that is allowed. That's it. Every game is ten minutes, and there is a variety of maps to choose from. With your treasure points, you can level up in each ten minute game, and choose different stats to boost. You can improve flying speed, flame power, gold carrying capacity, or your defence. You can't max all of them during a mission, so you level according to your playstyle. Do you like being a glass cannon that flies fast? Do you like being able to carry a lot of loot and tank everything? It's up to you.It can be frustrating to play against friends as well since you can damage them and force them to drop their treasure if their health drops to zero. In Co-Op you can't damage each other. You can choose to play with your friends or against them, but in against, prepare for a little rage to happen.GameplayIt can be played as a singleplayer or multiplayer game, so you can play all with friends, or with one or two against the computer. It's actually pretty good as the computer AI isn't easy to compete against. This makes it just as fun alone as with friends, and because the games are always so short, it leaves you plenty of time to do other things as well, instead of needing to be committed to one game for hours on end.ControlsBetter played with a gamepad. Otherwise Keyboard WASD to move and your mouse to burn things. They are a little clunky at times.SoundThe sound is relaxing, to the point you don't notice it as you focus on the game, it's perfect background noise. However, it can also be grating when your mission is nearing the end of the ten minute timer as it then becomes more noticeable,  since it makes you feel oh dear time is running out help! Overall VerdictThough its a simple and small game, nothing to get committed to, it can be the perfect game after a long and hard day, and you just want to relax to something by yourself for ten or so minutes at a time not having to worry about anything other than collect treasure with your purple flying dragon. And tell me... Who doesn’t want to be a dragon! Score : 9/10Want moar? Click here to join my steam group and Click here to follow my curator page! "

												Playing a dragon and doing what dragons do best (kidnapping princesses, burning villages and farms, and taking all the gold you can) is a blast. I've had a lot of fun and a lot of laughs playing this game. It is overall simple, yet it contains some complex elements. You can destroy towns and farms regularly or you can leave them alone and let them prosper, making farmer carts and wagons more valuable. You could even choose to make a town fear you and send you tribute instead of destroying it, but enemy dragons could destroy it or even make a town fear them instead. You can upgrade your dragon to suit the situation. The dragons change visually depending on how they're upgraded, which I thought was a nice touch.Hoard is at its best when you have friends to play it with. I still have fun in single-player, but the AI is not a challenge and has not been polished. I can easily end a round with more than 200,000 treasure while the enemy computer-controlled dragon has about 1,000 treasure. The AI is prone to flying straight through enemies without trying to dodge. Computer-controlled dragons will also sit on top of powerups for long periods of time in an attempt to pick them up, yet they can't because they already have a powerup that's ready to use. I've also had problems with computer-controlled dragons just hovering in random places for very long periods of time, causing them to get killed. You can play with up to four friends, but if you don't have enough players, the game will fill in any extra spots with computer-controlled dragons.I don't like the game's current music. It is too serious and doesn't match the fun, light-hearted nature of the game. I would recommend downloading and installing the old music. It really improves the game's atmosphere.I think the game is a bit pricey, but I'd recommend getting it and the DLC when it goes on sale. Definitely try to get friends to play it with if you get this game.			"

												Hoard is hard to pin to a particular genre, but I’d call it a mix of real-time strategy and action arcade with more focus on the latter.  Players will assume the role of a dragon whose goal will be to score the most points.  Players can go it alone, compete against the AI, or invite up to three friends into a multi-player match. In Hoard, there are four modes: Treasure, Princess Rush, Survival, and Co-op.  Treasure is the main mode in which players will be competing to earn the most gold.  The map will evolve around them as gold carts make their way from building to building.  Cities become more populated, castles become stronger, and the human NPCs become more vicious.  Players will be attempting to burn down whatever they can to collect gold and bring it back to their base, though they are free to attack each other.  If a dragon loses its health completely, it is forced back to its base to regenerate health and loses any score multipliers or gold that it may have been carrying. Therein lies the strategy element to the game…players can go about their business and just concentrate on collecting gold for their stash, but will miss out on resetting an opponent’s score multiplier by draining all of their health.  Allowing another player to keep a 3x score multiplier throughout the game can be disastrous.  Multipliers are earned by staying alive and continuously funding the stash, but can be lost in a number of different ways. Another neat aspect of the game that I find to be a great addition is that you can level up your dragon.  The more gold you stash, the more you can level up.  You’ll be able to increase your dragon’s speed, fire strength, armor, and carrying capacity.  Will you spec your dragon to be a slow-moving, but powerful tank…or will you opt to be Speedy Gonzales, stashing gold like no one’s business?All in all, Hoard is a fun diversion in fifteen or twenty-minute spurts.  It’s not something I’d play for hours on end, but it’s a game I come back to every so often when I need to fill time.  I’d recommend waiting until it was on sale (Steam does this often) and pick it up then.

												HOARD received a disappointing reception from the Steam community. I enjoy playing this game, but it quickly fell off the top 100 games list. There's nobody playing this now, which makes matchmaking difficult. While the AI is pretty good (better than me, actually), it's more fun to play with human opponents and their quirky styles, so bring a friend.The gameplay is fun. Fast-paced and frantic, like an arcade game. In multiplayer, however, there is no way to talk to the people in your game. If you're playing with people on your friends list, I suppose you could use Steam Chat to open up a voice channel, but for the most part you're playing blindly with strangers. This is OK, generally, except that matches take 8 minutes (I believe) and players sometimes drop out if they're losing. The Co-op game mode has the best chance of keeping a foursome together.Whatever, it mostly works, even though nobody plays. If you buy this, hit me up. I'd install it again to play with someone I know.			"

												To hear our full review, listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]HOARD is a fun arcade-style game about building your loot hoard as a dragon. It's played from an overhead view on maps that look like that they are built on a tabletop. As a dragon, you fly around destroying structures and enemies, collecting gold, and returning it to your hoard. As you collect more gold, you can upgrade your dragon's stats. There are several game modes but they are all essentially based on this mechanic and all about obtaining the high score.While this is all enjoyable, HOARD was clearly built around multiplayer (with both co-op and competitive modes) and playing by yourself to get a high score on the leaderboards gets boring very quickly. Unfortunately, there is no local multiplayer option and I was unable to find any games to join online. As a result, my wife and I couldn't play together and I had essentially experienced all the fun HOARD has to offer after just 15 minutes or so.Overall, there's nothing wrong with HOARD. It's a good concept that's executed well and seems like it would be fun to play... if you could actually play it with anyone. But with a dead community, lack of local multiplayer, and a complete lack of support from the developer (which was bought out by Kings), there really isn't much reason to play this one. I can only recommend HOARD if you pick up multiple copies so you can play with friends.			"

												I have had this game in my library for quite some time and figured that now would be a perfect time to review it as well as I think it sort of deserves it because this was the very first game I got on steam a couple of years ago thanks to my brothers. Originally, I saw it on PS3, but for reasons I can't remember I got it on here, thus starting my life as a PC gamer. However, that is a story for another time, for now it is time to say I would whole-heartedly recommend this game for those who don't have the time to play full games, yet it is quite challenging for those that want a bit more in their small games.You are a dragon and have to collect gold for your ever-growing pile back at your nest. Sounds simple enough, the difficulty comes in when you start to capture princesses, take down towers, defend your treasure agains thieves all the while raiding the villages around the map. There are many different mods, along with a nice tutorial which isn't all that helpful. How it works is you basically have to hit certain events in order to trigger more information about it. Once you've learned all the game has to offer, it lets you play a full game and offers you a gold if you can complete the challenge.It is very beautiful looking, I love the table-top aesthetic that is given to all of the boards. It runs really smoothly and the controls work alright for what it's worth: WASD for movement, mouse to aim. The only problems I've really come across was that the AI is extremely basic, which is difficult when you're doing Co-Op challenges trying to get gold on everything. Multiplayer is also wierd, but there isn't much else I can say about it.  Another thing to note is that it does tend to get very repetitive by flying around destroying villages, protecting your stuff and upgrading every time you reach a certain gold limit. The final thing I want to mention is that the enemy AI is RELENTLESS and will more often than not kill you more by sheer numbers than actual difficulty.You can also customize your game by modifying a few things, but not that much, if you want a quicker game or easier. If you have friends who are on the same network as you, there's a LAN feature that allows you to play together. For what it's worth, I say it's worth at least checking out if you're the type of person that enjoys grindy games and wants something to play for a few hours at a time in the same league as Fortix. Not really much else that I can say about this game without going into pointless details about the options, which there are a fair number of if you're the person that likes fiddling with menus.			"

I see plenty of fun in co-op, a more stable test of it all, but on single player it gets dull fast unfortunately.I'd reccomend it as it is now however, as it is well worth the bundle price in my opinion, but be wary its a ton of repetition in it in the long-haul.

YouTube™ Video: Hoard - Mouse Only Setting, but Not Really...  Funday Monday Accessibility Testing 

			Views: 92		

			Hey guys, we're going back to Hoard to see how Mouse Only access to Hoard really is. Fly along with me & Penelope the Pink to loot gold, kidnap princesses and most importantly test out accessibility!		

So far Hoard can somewhat be played with only a mouse.  Why somewhat you ask?  While there is an option to play that is labeled as “Mouse Only” sadly it requires spacebar usage.  Yeah I can’t figure that one out either.  I did discover keeping your Onscreen Keyboard over the edge of the Hoard window gives you spacebar access.Windowed mode does keep you locked in to  the game window, but overall gameplay can mainly be completed with minimal mouse movement and mostly left clicking.  We’ll keep testing vigilantly this weekend and give more information as we get in touch with our Dragon Side!			"

												I have thoroughly enjoyed this game on and off over the past four years since I purchased it and eventually the DLC content.In the past couple years, I've become a bit obsessed about collecting as close to 100% achievements as is reasonably possible for my middling gaming abilities. HOARD has been that rare exception where the game has not yet entirely outstayed its welcome in my active rotation.One challenge for any new buyers will be finding active players for any of the multiplayer content. Even if you are not after achievements, I highly recommend trying MP at some point. Co-op mode is a pure delight when joined by one or more capable veteran dragons! But you will need to use the appropriate forum threads to find such players, friend them, and then arrange play times.The only real sticking point for me with the game was the third and final single player game mode, called HOARD mode. I eventually began to enjoy this mode, but going for the gold medal on the four levels was a bit tedious. Other than that, I've had a delightful 70+ hours with this overlooked gem of a title.Easily worth $5 if on sale. 8.5/10Edit to update: Nominated this game for the 2016 ""Test of Time"" award because y not, rite?

												While the theme meshes very oddly with the gameplay - you are less of a mighty dragon and more of a fragile, sneaky wyvern - Hoard still provides excellent, arcadey action gameplay.  Burn the things, don't get hit while doing so, and ferry the treasure back home for points.  Simple, but effective.Individual sessions are quick, and replayability is provided in the form of several diverse modes, along with the heavy emphasis on high scores.  Coop is quite fun, but unfortunately there's no community to speak of, so you'll only get to enjoy it if you have friends.  Competive mode is even more fun, with the ability to convert towns to your side!Unfortunately, the scoring system is very arbitrary on a map by map basis, with some gold medals being easy to get and others nearly impossible.  The scoring system also is critical to a fault, and will ruin an entire run if you make the mistake of getting hit even once or twice in a ten minute session.  However, these minor flaws don't detract from the overall experience too much.This is a fantastic game for what it is, even if it's not what people were expecting from it.  Don't go into this one for a power trip fantasy - you are a glass cannon through and through.  Hoard can, perhaps, be blamed for choosing a theme that is not entirely matched perfectly with the style of game it is, but it's still a blast regardless.			"

												It's one little game (not really) where you fly around as a dragon, destroying everything (not really) to get money, upgrade your dragon (not with money, upgrade points come with score which is directly related to money you collect) and collect even more money! Staying alive longer and hoarding money and princesses gets you a bigger multiplier, which resets when you lose all your health.You can play alone (like me, *sobs*) or with (against) others! There are multiple gamemodes, although in the video below you see the main one. Others are kewl also, don't worry.What makes this game enjoyable is the whole style. It kind of seems like a board game. Also it's still fun to play against the computer. It's not all just destroy-everything-and-grab-the-little-money-you-get, it's useful to destroy only certain things, like caravans and Taverns (that's the place little midgets come from!)All in all, it is certainly worth a try!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												I purchased this game during the Steam sale in December, I only paid for the full game and the DLC about $5.00. However this game has provided endless amounts of entertainment. The game's concept is simple, fly around as a dragon and kill knights, steal princesses, razes villages and castles, and incinerate all who steal from you pile of gold, all while trying to gather more gold before the time runs out. I love the simplicity of the game its fun besides who doesn't want to be the dragon. I've played against COM-bots, online players, and friends who I called furiously stating that they need to get this game. I prefer co-op but, there is a game type and style combination for anyones taste. I love the base game and it does well to support itself without the DLC but, for additional maps I did purchase it. However that isn't to say that you don't have to the DLC for it to provide fun ways to help (or hinder) your fellow dragon. The game concept is simple, and is interesting from a stylistic stand point, like a table top board game. Its a rare and unique little gem that you don't see very often. I recomend buy this game however; if you want to wait for a sale that is good too.			"

												I like this game,  really truly do. Right up to the point where it became unplayable. And apparently the company that made it got bought out, and there's no way to get support for it any more. Don't waste your money on the frustration of not being able to turn your dragon around if you use crosshairs, and then the frustration of the game being too laggy to play if you turn the crosshairs off. Very disappointed in this game.			"

												So this game seems dumb and its price tag would definetly make you agree.  You are like a dragon and the whole goal is to fly around and spray things with fire, sounds kinda stupid right? Well it's actually pretty decent.  There is a lot of strategy to it and you are often racing someone else to gather more gold and such within a time limit.  It's pretty fun.  The only real downside is no one plays, so you are waiting 5 minutes or longer per game, can get old very fast.			"

Anywho, it's a cool concept, but frankly only really suited to the sorts of systems where couch diplomacy can come into play. If your computer is hooked up to lots of controllers and a TV, go for it. Otherwise, get it on another system or ignore it entirely. You probably won't miss much. 3/5			"

												This game is broken on multiple levels.On a gameplay level, the intended tension between letting the civilization build up for richer plunder later vs. ravaging it immediately doesn't work. It's a far, far more effective strategy to just burn everything the moment it appears. You score a lot more, and at much lower risk.But if you just want to ignore numbers and enjoy being a cadre of fire-breathing lizards terrorizing the puny monkey-men? It's broken technically, too: a mess of connection failures and desyncs. For months now, any attempt by us to play it leads to a pair of players not being able to see each-other move.			"

												Hoard, the prospet of playing as a dragon is cool, but it's got a lot of problems which kill the fun aspect of it.Problems and issues.1: Mouse controls are slow. This would not seem like much of a problem at first, but when you need to aim quickly when dealing with faster enemies, you need fast mouse controls for your aiming. This game's first obvious problem is it's mouse control.2: Limited controller use. It's only support falls into a Logitech controller, and an Xbox 360 controller, this doesn't support Mayflash support or what have you. Thankfully, this issue can be resolved by disabling the control pad in the options.3: Lack of mouse sensetivity control. This could have resolved issue 1 so easily, this could have made the game more enjoyable.4: Selfish uncoordinated AI. When you play co-op mode, you expect to have some coordination between the AI, but sadly, this is only achieved through players working together. The AI is set on felfish if or suicidal plans, which is not that bad when you play against it, however, this still means the AI will fail miserably in co-op mode which requires some level of coordination for optimal play.5: Buildings and units capable of attacking the player upgrade too quickly. This would not be such an issue in a long term game, but when a castle is guarded by a legion of champions because they tore into you in earlier periods does not help.6: Time on maps is too short. A mere 10 minutes isn't exactly favorable with gathering. interesting as it seems to see how high you can gather before time runs out, it would make more sense if it calculated how much you could hold until you expired from no funds remaining.7: thieves spawn too quickly as do taverns. This is sadly a case with towns you control, as thieves seldom discriminate on who they steal from! This can mean they may steal from you even with their town loyal to you!Some things to note of good fortune include...1: color selection, there is a variety of colors to choose from, which is great for identifying your own dragon.2: Multiplayer functionality, if you can get some friends gathered up for a Co-op match, it's worth it to optimize your resources, and coordinate attacks for the benefit of your group, or to see who is the better dragon.3: The option to use a controller. This is a good idea, though it needs work, and more controller support for things such as the Mayflash adapter with Wii Classic controller Pro.4: BEING A DRAGON, now this is a fun idea, it's unfortunate though that the game has some issues.5: Potentially easier methods of collecting gold. From kidnapping princesses, destroying carts to take money, through grabbing massive gems to turn into fast easy funds, ransom can be a potent means of collecting money. Wizard gems however are nearly suicide as the towers upgrade too quickly, and do so much damage that 2 hits means you're flynig back to your hoard to recover.If you're a fan of games that are brutally difficult, and have a cruel learning curve, I recommend it! Otherwise, until the creators patch this game to improve and expand the controls, stay away.			"

												The low metacritic score for this game is an utter crime. It is a simple game, but one that is simply fun.Horde is a party game at it's core, to the point where the ascthetic of the game is one of a boardgame assemebled on a table top. When played with friends it has all the hallmarks of a great board game to, diplomacy, backstabing, the frantic strugle for an edge to eek your way ahead of the competition as the countdown timer approaches zero... Though that last one is rare in actual board games.For such a simple game it is very well thought out. Every aspect of dragon culture has been carefully included to make a highly dynamic, well balanced, cutthroat multiplayer game. There is no deep story or plot. Just some well developed game mechanics for lighthearted frantic fun. If you enjoy hunting for achievements the single player will offer a lot of replayability as well as they are well designed to actually require some skill and practice to achieve and collect... And that skill and practice will come in handy when it later comes time for you to torch your friends so you can take their precious gold for yourself.Heres what you need to know. You are a dragon, you live an a fantasy country side in which the local peasants are trying to amass wealth and power, and you being a glorious dragon much more powerful and worthy of that wealth are going to take it from them.The games consists of a serious of 10-15 minute matches. In those 10-15 minutes, farms and villages will grow, send trade caravans to one another, build watch towers and defences... And you will burn them all to the ground, take the gold that is left from the ashes, terrify the villages into sending you tribute and kidnapping their princesses for ransome all to grow your hoard, because that's what dragons do... All dragons... Those other dragons on the map are not your friends... They are cutting into your profits... You see them eyeing your hoard... Turn your back and they will steal from you just as happily as from the peasants. You can't let them. Because to a dragon the size of your hoard is status, it is power. The more gold you amass the stronger you become. Rush to accumulate wealth the fastest so you can put those other upstart dragons in their place... The timer is ever ticking down, whoever has the largest hoard when it reaches zero wins!			"

												This game is a fun, casual, arcade style experience.  I recommend a gamepad but you can play with with Keyboard and Mouse. Your fingers tend to get tied up during frantic play with K&M so if you have a gamepad, plug it in.You play a dragon and you have to acquire gold for your hoard using your fire breath and special power-ups while keeping the other dragons for amassing more gold than you.  It's simple and fun.  As you collect more gold you'll earn points you can use to upgrade your abilities in speed, fire breath, carrying, and armor.  Every time you start a new level your points reset so your choices only affect the current level.There isn't a story mode to this game so if you're looking for something deeper, this isn't it.  This is an arcade style game for short term fun.  I personally like it. It's a fun way to pass some time.  At the time of this review I have NOT played any of the DLC.			"

But it does have a couple of frustrating traits, especially because they are so fixable.Pros:   1 - Simple game concept with enough variation to keep it fun.          * Different dragon upgrade paths          * Wide range of game maps (I do have the DLC)          * Enough variety of threats   2 - Does not require much time two of three games modes are 10 minutes or less.Cons:   1 - The powerful tower shots are not easy to see AND they seem to go under buildings making them impossible to see.   2 - If you are torching a town a firework cart can easily take your health to zero making you return to your hoard and reseting the score multiplier.   3 - The 3/4 overhead view can cause slight miscalculations on picking up ground items and knowing the range of dragons fire depending on angle.   4 - The color of my dragon has to be picked every time on single player mode unless I want random.

												If you ever wished to see what is the life of a dragon, then this is a game for you. Sure, the controls might be a tad bit rigid, especially with Aiming via Mouse (that I have severe problems with, even though my Mouse is completely alright and works properly) like in my case (my dragon refuses to obey my Mouse movement and doesn`t wish to rotate where I actually aim. But well, given that I play this via laptop ... yeah), it`s still easily negligible and if you have a strong enough computer, it should pose you no problem at all. As for repetition problem that might arise once you play single player a tad bit too much ... well, the solution for it is simple - hop into Multiplayer, find a friend and start a match of both utter devastation and lolz you both can make on both the kingdom of your choosing and maybe even on each other if you don`t play co-op. Try earn a Gold Rating on every single kingdom - believe me, the difficulty of it would make you wish to be like Frisk from Undertale: DETERMINATION INCARNATE! :,DMAKE EVERYONE FEAR YOU, EVEN OTHER DRAGONS YOU HAVE TO FACE ... unless you play co-op, in which case MAY THE COUNTRYSIDE FEAR THE UNITED MIGHT OF ALL DRAGONS THAT CALL THAT PLACE ""HOME""!

												I LOVED this game on PS3. It's the same game here, except the video drivers don't work for me in full screen, forcing me to use ""windowed"" mode. Furthermore, the option for local multiplayer is completely absent, which is a shame, because HOARD is best experienced with friends. It's disappointing, because it seems like these things could have been addressed in an update, but never were. Since it still hasn't been, years later, I'm not holding my breath. On the other hand, if you are not someone who is looking for local multiplayer and don't have an issue with the video setup, then this is otherwise a fantastic game. (If you have a choice, however, opt for the PS3 version.)			"

The aim is to get a certian ammount (or more than everyone else) within the time limit. You can steal from carriages, burn down wheat, burn down mills, kidnap princesses to ransom or even destroy a wizard's tower to steal a immensely valuable gem. I'd vertainly give it a go and it can be a lot of fun, though there is sadly not story to be had with this game.			"

												It's not easy to write a recommendation to this game.  First things first: make sure you have any controller to use instead of the mouse!I love the concept, the graphics are quite good, and gameplay WOULD be good too - but there are some issues with this game. Most of all: in many cases the mouse sensitivity is just absurdly low. You supposed to aim and breath fire with the mouse, but I'd bet my desk isn't big enough to make a 180° turn in this game, the mouse just doesn't responds as normal. The mouse sensitivity problems makes it unplayeable in this cases, sadly. If you can solve/prevent this issue, or you can use a controller, the game worth it's money. If it's on 50% + sale, it's a really, really good deal, don't miss it out!			"

While games start out slow paced, they pick up speed as the round continues on, eventually becoming pretty difficult, and, while it may take some practice to master the techniques, it's well worth the effort.  The only downside is the lack of a multiplayer community (which is a real shame), but if you have friends with the game, all I can tell you to do is, well, MAKE THEM PLAY IT TOO :D			"

												HORDE is a multiplayer game that you can also play as single player against bots. You are controllign a dragon and need to burn everything and gather as much gold as possible during f.ex. 10 minutes. Feels entertaining for a little while, but then again against bots this will become boring. So if you have MP company then I'd say this is worth to get.			"

												I have fun playing it. It really is a simple game. You'll be a dragon and hoard all the gold. There's also a competition from another dragon, princess to kidnap, heroes to fry, and make the world (board?) burn. And, every game is kept in check by time limit before fun runs out.Playing using gamepad is good enough, you can control all aspect of the game from the couch.One minor problem is, it bit more than it suppose too in performance department.But, all in all, I recommend this game.

												The big problem with Hoard is that your dragon just feels so WEAK. You fly around without any inertia or power, a puny archer or two is a deadly threat, and destroying anything with your fire breath feels like you're melting an ice cube with a blow dryer. Actually, no, a blow dryer will keep going as long as you need it, but your fire runs out after a few seconds so it feels more like someone with severe asthma trying to blow out his birthday cake candles. And in keeping with the feeling of weakness, fire is your only weapon - you don't get to bite, claw or tailwhip anyone.It's really a shame, because playing as a dragon who gets to rampage through a living kingdom was a great idea. It would have been an even better idea if there had an asymmetrical mode where the dragon players went up against human players  who controlled the kingdom Majesty-style, but still a good idea ruined by making a friggin' DRAGON feel WEAK.

												Hoard is a pretty casual Co-Op ""mine, mine, all of it mine!' type f scoring game. The graphics are easy on the eye and the game rules aren't that deep. Rather shallow. But, this only ads to the somewhat addictive type of game experience that comes from Hoard. You always want to get more and more of those rpecious golden coins. One more and another one. The contrrols are simple, but efficient and not all game pads are supported. But, I think that the keyboard and mouse are the best choice if you want to score high during this game.The idea with Hoard is to play as adragon against or with other dragons and to nick as much gold as possible from the peaceful villagers and nature humans roaming the fields. That's it, not more and not less. And still, this simple idea is just about perfect for this type of game. What dragon can get the most stash?Basically, Hoard is a pretty solid game and a ""can't go wrong"" thing if you hit it during a sale event. Perfect for some dead time occupation between the bigger titles.			"

												It's fun, grabbing gold and burning villages.Then you learn that early-game knights can one-shot you. Not any respectable dragon I've ever seen. You get armor, speed, attack and (treasure) carrying capacity upgrades, but early on you're just a flying lizard that can barely burn down a windmill before it REPAIRS ITSELF. I don't feel like much of a dragon until the game (10 minute time limit) is almost over and it's time to start over again.Wizard towers are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥more than anything. They can one-shot you even late game with all your upgrades, have obscene health, and drop a valuable gem that makes you snail-slow and fills your carrying capacity. Any opponent that sees you hauling a gem will shoot your butt down.This isn't so much a game as a series of mini-games running on the same theme. Kind of like Mario party, minus the board game. By the time you get comfortable with what you're doing, it's over. There's no story, just map selection. There's no characters, just choosing your dragons color. There are no other dragon types to pick.TD;LR:-You start too weak, and by the time you're strong the game is over.-knights can one-shot you, even though you're flying.-wizard towers will one-shot you, even late game, and their range is outrageous.-the AI is DIRT STUPID. If you're even half paying attention you'll blow it out of the water by 100k's of gold.-no story, just map and game mode selections.-There is only one type of dragon, you can only change your color.-You can lose a map to the AI and still be rewarded a medal. (Why???)It's just not ""enough game"" to warrent buying, I have to give it a thumbs down. Its a good idea, but it should've been so much more. :(			"

												Dont buy this. First off, I never bought this, I won it and it's DLC in the Steam Auction of 2014. The game looked and sounded promising from the reviews I've read and gameplay I've seen, and I love dragons, but I couldn't even play it for awhile because upon starting, the game freezes at the main menu and a ""Reuben.exe"" error pops up. Many people seem to have the same problem, but the developers don't visit the community forum often and so far, haven't helped.I removed Steam overlay, and that somehow fixed it. First off, the tutorial doesn't do a good enough job of explaining aspects of the game. I always lost no matter what, because the AI dragon would steal from my hoard. The tutorial never explained how to do that. Secondly. This is a shameful port. If you don't have a controller, you're at a big disadvantage as you'll only be able to breathe your fire towards to left and not multi-directional. Lastly, it just isn't worth the price tag while the developers refuse to help their fanbase with major issues.			"

												so recently i bought hoard suspecting it would be a good game... i was so very wrong its a GREAT game!think of times when knights roamed and dragons darkened the skys. when knights would fight for there kingdoms against dragons, and the fearless knight would fight the dragon to save the princess. this is THAT.you play as the dragon who razes the towns and carts for there gold, attacks knights and snatchs princcesses for the ransom the hold. there is many modes not just the gather most treasure to win, there is also who can capture and ransom the most princesses. and various other modes to play. this is a game where u can play against other dragons which makes things a tad bit tougher but also more fun, why? because it adds more to the gameplay.fight against the other dragons and gain a powerup to steal there hoard stash.oh and a final thing to add if u play with other dragons u can make the towns fear u and whats that do you ask? it makes them send u tributes of easy gold <3 but there is also a downside the enemy can do the same thing and take over ur tributed towns.oh and did i mention those pesky thiefs? burn them to ashs i say!overall its a great game with or without friends as if u play alone u can choose to add npc dragons or just gather treasure to gain the medals or just have fun.cause hey who doesnt love being a legendary flying beast burning down villages towns and knights and various other things <3   10/10 bring loot or we may burn ur town down :)if this review is not helpful, please leave a comment as to why u feel that way so i may make changes if needed ^w^			"

												Lemme preface this by saying I got this from the Humble Indie Bundle X.  I did not pay full price for this.  And BOY AM I GLAD!  I am 100% OK with games that have ""bad"" graphics.  What am not OK with is crappy ports from console with FPS CAPS!!!  The game may be fun but regardless of the settings I get about 25 fps which is awful...TL;DR Crappy console port			"

												WHY DOES THE GAME TELL ME THAT IT'S A DEMO? THE BUNDLE SAID IT WAS THE FULL GAME, I CAN EVEN REVIEW IT SO WHAT THE HELL?Looks like the devs consider themselves so important and famous that they released a demo that costs money. For some reason this crappy game decided that it's a demo instead of being the full version even though I've paid money for it in a bundle. The game has ads that beg me to buy the full version. What the hell is happening? I didnt think that dose of krokodil was THIS strong.This would've been a decent smartphone game but as a PC game it's far too simple and not that entertaining. The bugs and the fact that it's telling me that it's only a demo is even less entertaining.			"

Then all of a sudden, there's more dragons, princesses to kidnap, knights to kill, thieves to stop and crops to destroy... all while trying to out-hoard the other dragons.  Try this game out, you won't be disappointed.			"

												I really like this original little game. The whole setting and objective is just so fresh and it appears to have huge potential as a frantic multi-player. The only drawback is that it doesn't have a proper continuous single player campaign and the campaign mode itself is more like a collection of skirmishes strung together with no storyline. Anyone looking for depth is likely to be disappointed but if it's a quick bit of fun between games that require more heavy thinking you are after then this is a little gem. 69%			"

Each round is 10 minutes long - collect gold, kidnap princesses, take out rival dragons, or simply just survive. Not complicated - but not pretending to be. If you can get it in a bundle or on sale for a good price, it's worth a go.			"

												You. Are. A. Dragon. Arcade style play, yet hours of addictive gameplay. The game mechanics work around ""Double-Edged Sword"" ideas. Such as letting the farmland grow to increase the amount of goods shipped into towns, which are trying to kill you. So why let them do this? Because then the towns will produce more treasure, and you want treasure. A few game-types are available, but the best one is ""Treasure"" Mode, which is what it sounds like. Gather treasure.You can pit up against other dragons (Bot accessible!) and the level of challeng sky-rockets. Protect your Hoard of gold from theives and other dragons. Fight for supreme rule. Make towns fear you and have them pay tribute! How epic is that?All in all, you are a mighty dragon that nobody F**ks with. Great game. Buy it.			"

												Super fun game, but it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥on my craptop. :(You play a dragon, and if you've never read The Hobbit, dragons hoard treasure!So it's your job to fly around the kingdom and grab all the gold you can.As you collect treasure, you earn levels that allow you to fly faster, breathe fire longer, carry more loot, or take more damage without having to retreat.You'll need those advantages too! As you play towns build up and produce soldiers to defend themselves, castles come up and spawn ultra-powerful knights to ♥♥♥♥ you up, wizard towers appear and can one-shot kill you if you let them grow, and in some maps there are even other dragons competeing against you!Also keep an eye out for royal carriages, destroying one will spawn a princess you can take hostage for tons of loot, and if you manage to destroy a wizard's tower it'll leave behind a super-valuable gemstone for your troubles.Watch out though, as your hoard gets larger thieves will start to spawn... character limit. :l			"

												Hey guys so i thought it would be a good idea to take a take a break from all the horror games and play something a lil different. This is Hoard a game where you play as a dragon that is hell bent on stealing the gold of kingdoms and their fair princess's all in the name of your hoard of gold! sounds awesome right well lets play this game together as i try out its four modes Princess rush Hoard treasure and normal this game is also multiplayer and is insanely fun to play with a friend! would i recommend this game... in One word YES!

												Super fun game, but it runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥on my craptop. :(You play a dragon, and if you've never read The Hobbit, dragons hoard treasure!So it's your job to fly around the kingdom and grab all the gold you can.As you collect treasure, you earn levels that allow you to fly faster, breathe fire longer, carry more loot, or take more damage without having to retreat.You'll need those advantages too! As you play towns build up and produce soldiers to defend themselves, castles come up and spawn ultra-powerful knights to ♥♥♥♥ you up, wizard towers appear and can one-shot kill you if you let them grow, and in some maps there are even other dragons competeing against you!Also keep an eye out for royal carriages, destroying one will spawn a princess you can take hostage for tons of loot, and if you manage to destroy a wizard's tower it'll leave behind a super-valuable gemstone for your troubles.Watch out though, as your hoard gets larger thieves will start to spawn... character limit. :l			"

												You. Are. A. Dragon. Arcade style play, yet hours of addictive gameplay. The game mechanics work around ""Double-Edged Sword"" ideas. Such as letting the farmland grow to increase the amount of goods shipped into towns, which are trying to kill you. So why let them do this? Because then the towns will produce more treasure, and you want treasure. A few game-types are available, but the best one is ""Treasure"" Mode, which is what it sounds like. Gather treasure.You can pit up against other dragons (Bot accessible!) and the level of challeng sky-rockets. Protect your Hoard of gold from theives and other dragons. Fight for supreme rule. Make towns fear you and have them pay tribute! How epic is that?All in all, you are a mighty dragon that nobody F**ks with. Great game. Buy it.			"

												Just awful, no two ways around, ignore the positive reviews they're clearly very easily impressed. There are so many things wrong, first is the tutorial level which pauses the level every few seconds to give you such pointless info as the fire powerup makes you fire breath more powerful... like, no♥♥♥♥♥♥ After the abysmal excuse for a tutorial, come the bizarre and just plain stupid game balence issues. Dying fluxuates from insanly easy to isanely hard for no reason, knights kill you in one hit, archer 3 or for and other dragons after about a year of fire breath. the powerups often seem to have no effect, the game take every oppurtunity to skrew you over with random hordes of knights or archers right at critical moment, causing you to lose all the money you're carrying to one of the other dragons. capturing princesses becomes impossible after about 5 minutes because there are too many knights with there one hit kills to defend against, plus other dragons will steal her while you're battling knights. The AI dragon seems to be almost imortal, casually soaking up arrows right from the off even without powerups. In all honesty the game feels extremly unfair right from the off, with chaotic game balence and cheating AI. A lot about the game looked like it had potential, the consept is very cool and it's ashame that these complaints have to ruin it. If I were to give constuctive critism, I'd say let me fly and breath fire at the same time, rebalence the powerups so they feel more effective, fix the immortal AI dragon, make the knight 3 hit kill rather than one, and archers about 8 or 9 hit kills. I think then you'd have a pretty good game. Until then i'm giving this game 5/10 Not Horrible			"

Otherwise you shold pass on this one.The only thing that i can see people realy enjoying is competing for highscore in multiplayer, all other parts of this game are on par with what you might find in a free to play game. That's not to say they are bad they just are not particularly good. The parts i am refering to are things like; AI, level/skill system, maps, game modes and general balance of dificulty/reward.			"

This game is a little, and I do mean little, when playing with friends and you are attacking each other. My main problem is that this game does not support local multiplayer.

												A fun, fast-paced game with surprising complexity. As the game goes on, the land develops, and you must decide what's worth burninating now for cash, and what should be left to grow -- destroy nothing, and your dragon falls behind the others, but destroy everything and you never reap the rewards of a fat, wealthy countryside. Attack the other players land, or keep your gold guarded. Capture princesses for ransom, or burn their castles down to end the annoying knight problem. challenge the ogre at the end of the session, or stand safely away while he bulldozes everything in his path. Build a bruiser dragon to attack your competitors directly, or a swift dragon who can raid towns and disappear. Good for casual LANs, or a quick arcade break. Not recommended if you want a long-term project.			"

												HOARD is a pretty fun strategy game. You pkay on what looks to be a tabletop board and try to collect gold, upgrading your dragon and beating enemy dragons along with hostile NPC:s. It's an entertaining game with short rounds, so even if you only have 15 minutes for playing you can well play a game of HOARD. The graphics are very fitting for the game and the tutorial is good.

Its pretty fun if you had a group of people playing it, in the way that Dr. Mario or Fusion Frenzy were fun. In small doses.Good challenge, and pretty fun. I got bored after about an hour though.

												This is a very, very simplistic game for those who want to spend five minutes on something trivial while commuting to work. There is potential for a much more interesting game, but lack of a proper story and strategic elements make the player lose interest quickly. Only recommended for those looking for a short diversion from something else.			"

Fly around, burn stuff you don't like, grab gold & princesses for your treasure pile, and roast anyone who has a problem with it. Play with or against other dragons to make the biggest pile of shiny-treasury-goodness you can within the time limit. Overall; a remarkably fun diversion, great for a quick distraction from whatever else you have going on.

												This game is for people who either want a quick minigame or want to play a fairly simple game with friends.Single player, it's nothing special. Fly around. Burn stuff. Collect rewards. Blahblahblah. No matter the game mode, it's very repetitive.If you play multiplayer, especially with people you know, it gets interesting. Sure, it's still the same thing, but now it's competitive, against those you know, and if they beat you you have a score to settle, you beat them, you have a record to keep. It's more fun and engaging this way.I recommend getting this game when it's on sale and getting some of your friends to get it at the same time. Have fun!			"

												I have been playing Hoard a little bit and found out that it is exacty what it pretends to be; a charming little game and nothing else. From its board-like set up to its colourful graphics, it reminds you of childhood board games played with your friends and that is precisely what it is.It's a fun game, entertaining and cute in its own way. It's not a great game but then again, it's not trying to be one.Hoard is far more entertaining when played with your friends and that is obvious in its design (again mimicking a board game). I have yet to play the multiplayer. But it feels clear to me that Hoard, is one of those games in which the conceited laughs and moans of frustration coming from the person sitting next to you on the couch, are half the fun of the game.That said I do not think it's a game worth 10 bucks, I feel that it would be better served as a 5 or 6 bucks game and probably sell better. However I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in these kind of board-like videogames the moment it goes on sale.			"

That's not to say they are bad they just are not particularly good. The parts i am refering to are things like; AI, level/skill system, maps, game modes and general balance of dificulty/reward.			"

The strategy involves prioritising what to burn (other dragons, townspeople, buildings, carts ect) and accumulating as much loot as possible without losing all your health and resetting your score multiplier!!!!!There are a couple of different modes to try out and getting a gold rated score can be a challenge on some maps. If you are an achievement hunter then there are plenty of achievements to collect.The biggest drawback is the lack of players on multiplayer which make online matches unlikely unless you have a friend who is up for a game but on the few occasions where someone has been online I have found it adds to the fun.Burn it all!!!!!!

You are a dragon whos objective is to burn down cities while collecting gold. but wait! is it just that simple? no. dpending on your game mode, mapsize, and difficulty there will be several challanges such♥♥♥♥♥.. wizard towers sending powerful projectiles toward you, knights and castles and towns will spawn crossbowmen to prevent you from stealing gold. If your quick you can keep them at bay but sometimes if your not paying attention they'll build up and make it difficult to loot. As much fun as this game is its not the most fun, there are other games id rather be playing, but id reccomend this for people who want to relax everyso often and burn some things and deffintly if you can get it cheap on sale for $2-$3.

												For little money this is really worth it. The demo includes the whole tutorial, so it should give you a good idea whether this is fun or not. However, competeting for highscores alone or against Ai Dragons gets stale after a while, so you'd better have someone to play this game with for a longer amount of playtime. Aside from that, my only additional criticism would be the lack of an actual singleplayer campaign, as well as a level editor.			"

												A really nice role reversal of your typical game - instead of playing the hero, saving the town, you play as a dragon destroying a town. Really quite fun.			"

												A casual indie game with simple gameplay mechanics. However, what makes the game fun is that you can play this with just about anyone. It's easy to pickup and easy to teach to others. Mostly the game evolves around you and the other players taking control of a dragon and burning other buildings and people in a small map environment and returning the gold that is dropped to your 'hoard', thus gaining points.

												This is basically an arcade-y board game.  You control a dragon and fly to different parts of the game board in real time to acquire resources towards the win condition, with little upgrades to your dragon and temporary power--ups along way.  I like the concept of playing as a dragon in this aspect, and the game doesn't do much of anything wrong either.Play against the clock, the computer, or friends.  A few different map types and a number of boards are available.  Don't take this game TOO seriously, as its more of a party game than one with measured competative balance.  I think it could be fun as an occasional timewaster but I don't seem to have many friends to play it with in that regard.I can't really strongly reccommend it and if you've got nobody to play it with its probably not the best fun, but there's nothing wrong with the game.

												Only thing missing from this game is an online match making system, really, where you can see rooms and freely join/chat/change game mode/wait for more players, etc. Super short and super fun, I got addicted for 5 hours straight, haha. A round usually takes 10 minutes, so obviously it's not a hardcore game. There is coop and vs modes for 1-4 players, so if you want something to play with your friends once in a while, say for example when waiting for the dude who is always late from your gaming sessions, or you don't want to wait while 2-3 pople are afk, it's a perfect pick. There are quite a few ways to backstab the others, but a round is short, so you need to think and act fast: before you could whine and say some ugly♥♥♥♥♥♥to your fellow friends, you will already find yourself collecting hoards of gold and stealing their treasures and princesses. Maybe it can seem a bit pricey for the full price, but imho it totally worth it, even if you don't wait for a sale.			"

												Fairly simple game. You're a dragon. There is a country side before you. Burn and pillage the farms, towns, and palaces for gold and princesses to increase your hoard size. Hoard goes up, you gain levels.Can be a little janky on wasd commands, but I've yet to play it with and xbox controller. Maps are ~10 min long so It's good for a quick ""I want to play something but don't have a lot of time."" Lots of cumulative achievements and a fun casual game.			"

												Hey guys so i thought it would be a good idea to take a take a break from all the horror games and play something a lil different. This is Hoard a game where you play as a dragon that is hell bent on stealing the gold of kingdoms and their fair princess's all in the name of your hoard of gold! sounds awesome right well lets play this game together as i try out its four modes Princess rush Hoard treasure and normal this game is also multiplayer and is insanely fun to play with a friend! would i recommend this game... in One word YES!
