Early Access Review
								This is an early access game and I will update my review as time goes on to reflect the current state of the game. $30 is definitely way too much for this game. Also, do not buy expecting the game currently has full controller support as currently advertised on the Steam store page. It seems the developer jumped ahead and added what *may* be added in the future. That is, provided he doesn't decide to move that feature to his ""next game"" as he has been doing with several other promised features.On first impression you'll feel like you just bought a port of the iOS puzzle game for about 30x more than the portable version costs. The game has awkward menus that one must click and hold with the mouse to slide them around. The menus feel broken, as it seems like things are off screen and there isn't any intuitive way to access the off-screen menu items with the mouse.Even in early access, the developer talks so highly of his game that I thought perhaps it would blow me away. I imagined never before seen mechanics and gameplay but found myself let down by the hype. I would recommend waiting until the price is reduced to at most $15.It's interesting to find a game in early access where feedback is highly censored and not welcome from experienced fans of the genre. What is the point of making your game early access if you aren't willing to hear constructive feedback? The gameplay itself is limited to one mode at the moment where you play until the gamespace fills up. This is quite challenging and fun. As you play you match 3 elements and each match creates new elements. These new elements then start to appear in the pieces you are given to make creating new elements easier. It's exciting to try and see what new element comes next and it makes for that ""just one more game"" feeling.Sound effects are minimal and nice, just right for this kind of game. The music is a bit repetitive with only 3 similar (short) tracks. The music has the same low quality mono sound that Faerie Solitaire has. Hopefully the music will get an upgrade in quality as game development goes on.You will find that the developer for this game has an interesting ""my way or the highway"" type personality. When the game was first released as early access the forums filled up with potential customers wondering why the price for this game is 3x higher than any other puzzle game on Steam, including the best selling games in this genre. They were still interested, just wanted to know the story behind the price. By their play time and achievements you could see many of them love puzzle games and own his previous game on Steam and were genuinely interested in purchasing and playing this game.The developer started deleting price topics and making rules that comments are welcome as long as they are not about the price. He would then say that if you don't like the price then you must not be a true fan of quality puzzle games because he loves this game he is creating. He even started telling the gamers that this game isn't for you if you think $30 is too much. Requesting an explanation of what makes the game so unique results in a pasted copy of the match 3 concepts that are in this game, nothing unique or exciting about it.Next up the developer created a sub forum called ""Price Topics Go Here"" and started closing and moving topics. You would think having so many topics about the price would give a clue as to what action is needed next for a healthy community. The sub-forum became too much of a hassle and was closed. Now he has one pinned (and locked) topic about price being something he will not discusss, even if it is questions about what makes the game worth 3x more than the competition.I would definitely wait on this title--you won't have much of a chance to give input. If you don't like how things are--then, as he would say, ""This game isn't for you.""Update 11/4/15. They finally changed the menu, most of the menu is still grayed out though. I feel bad for those that purchased in the beginning when they were charging much more and promising the world, afterwards they announced quite a bit of the content is being moved to other future games for various reasons. I don't support that kind of mentality. The price is much more reasonable now $2.99 is the current price. It's still a fun match 3 game and certainly the most polished looking Subsoap game yet. If you buy make sure you're okay with what is currently present and don't mind if it ever gets finished, updates have slowed considerably.Update 11/1/14. The game store page shows full controller support (meaning this game can be launched and played entirely with a controller). I tested with a usb xbox 360 controller (the most frequently used controller on Steam) and found that nothing in the game can be controlled with a controller, there are also no options to enable controller support. No real gameplay changes. Still about the same amount of content as over 6 months ago. The menus are still clunky. Updates are slow and infrequent, not sure what is actually being done with them. Seems like a tweak here and there, no real content being added overtime. More than 80% of the menu items are still entirely disabled. You still need to scroll to see all the menus but you still can't use the scroll wheel you have to click and drag behind the menu as if you were on a touchscreen. This gives the game a more authentic mobile port feeling.Update 6/9/14: Played another 2 hours of the game. Not much has changed. The small amount of content in the game is still fun. The menus still feel ported over from mobile and are not well suited for mouse--you'll find yourself needing to click-hold and drag the main menu around to get to the different options. The developer replied to my review, only commented on the items related to price though. The developer has stated that he's decided to remove the more advanced pet features from this game (not yet present, pets show ""coming soon"" on the menu) and make a seperate game out of the majority of the planned pet features.

Early Access Review
								Bait and switch.  I challenged the developers on Dec 17, 2014 about the status of this game.  That's correct; 2014!Back then it was $29.99, had TONS of placeholder options dimmed out/unavailable, and was always ""about to be added"".  Of course the devs locked the topic (on page 4 currently of the discussion board for this game, I'm confident it wont make it much past page 5 with how slow their forums move) and went on scamming the playerbase out of their money at a high price point.  When challenged, the player was always conveniently blamed for being at fault for being unreasonable/too demanding/impatient. Seriously, just go check out the locked forum post on page 4.  The placeholders that existed back then promised to have loads of content.  If you weren't playing during the end of 2014, you probably aren't even aware as a player of the options that were supposed to be added as content during the development of the game, so you're not even witting to what hasn't been given to you.  Just by reading the other reviews, it's clear that they chose to ""correct"" the options that use to be dimmed out for future release by just simply removing them.  So now the game is $2.99 because the community is on to them and they want to pull a few more folks in with what really boils down to a mobile app game now.  The irritation levels for the folks that pay $2.99 probably won't be as high for the folks that paid $29.99 or $14.99 when they realize the short lived period of this game, but I wanted to leave this review to show the character and bait & switch tactics that they chose to employ for folks that may not have been around over a year ago.

								Early access, not recommended at this time.  I picked this up with a coupon, but if you're interested, install Faerie Alchemy on your Android or iOS device for free.The core match 3 gameplay is good, and the planned features sound promising, with a storyline, multiple game modes, a pet system, and multiplayer.  Though the game has potential, the current state is what you would expect from a free mobile game.  The controls are touch oriented, and those features nonexistent.  There is only a single basic game mode along with a rudimentary inventory and crafting system.			"

								Consists mostly of greyed out game options that can't be selected. Maybe some day it will be a whole game. When/If that happens, and it's worthwhile, I will be changing this review. But as for right now, it's absolutely not worth the price tag. There are free flash versions of games exactly like what's offered so far. Save yourself 30 bucks.(EDIT)The developer makes excuses on every negative review. ""I'm making this game only for people who like it."" That is NOT how you give customers what they want. Listen to what the people are telling you they are PAYING you to make this game. Don't just put out some abandoned piece of trash like this, and then tell everyone why it's their fault when they point out you released broken trash. The last time I contacted the developer I was told there would be ""weekly updates to fix these issues"". That was now over two months ago. Not an update since. This is an abandoned project, or worse, a cash grab-and-run scheme from the start. I can't tell which. Don't give FaeVerse a freaking dime. To support this kind of ""developer"" is to punish the gaming community at large.			"

Early Access Review
								Update: I just want to point out this review was made 2 years ago... Final update: after what seems like forever the developer have decided to make the game ""Free"" which is there way of saying we are giving up but we aren't. After the horrible mismanagement not only in development, but also in the PR aspect I would Highly recommend NEVER dealing with this Developer for anything.While this game is fun, it is very much unfinished. Many of the promised feature are not there. There is hardly anything in the game right now. This would not be a big deal for me being that it is early access, however there has not been a update or any progress in months. The dev have either secretly abandoned the game, or have a very poor work effort. They constantly claim they want to wait to have something big or finished before they update the game, but in the amount of time its been since there has been a update there is no reason why a large portion of the game hasn’t been finished. So for now even with a 90% off coupon I would avoid this game. Even if the dev released an update at this point I probably would not change my opinion until its actually released with the content promised because at this point that will either be never or in 2050.

								This is a wonderful puzzle game. Already one of my favorites. It reminds me of Tetris in that you move your puzzle piece into position and you match three like in Bejeweled. Additionally, they have added a crafting component to the game. Very fun game.			"

								The game is over a year (almost a year and a half) in early access and while it gets an update here and there, as it is it certainly isn't worth 15$. I was really looking forward to see what they'll add when I started playing it, but since then only minimal progress has been made. The presentation is nice and with looking at the community section you can actually figure out what to do, but it's really a raw gem at best right now. Adding more specials into the game instead of getting the basic tutorial and story bits together might be the wrong approach,I really hope that the game will be finished, but for now I can not recommend it.

Early Access Review
								At first I thought it was a tetris clone, then I thought of bejeweled... after i played it though I realized that it is something both similar and very different to the games this must had been inspired by.Game play wise I think its brilliant. Its clever, fast and it requires you to think ahead. It generally played smoothly but it did crash often (not mid game though).In some ways it feels like it was not finished, or maybe that it was actually finished in a real hurry... the menu system is rudimentary and a lot of things are not explained (such as the requirements for some levels). I had to struggle a bit to understand what some of them meant (truth be told, some of them I still don't understand). Maybe these are explained somewhere, I couldn't find where, but to be fair I didn't look very hard.Would I recommend it ? yea I would, its a tough challenging,  yet casual, game that has a lot to offer. It will frustrate those with little patience for it seems very hard in the beginning. it remains fairly hard but the learning curve is not too steep.If you like games like tetris and bejeweled (and want a slightly more challenging game) definitely give it a shot.

								This game is far from finished. It currently contains 2 ""Game modes"", and they are just spin offs of bejeweled like games. That being said, this game has some potential. The crafting of items puts a new spin on the boring gameplay similar to so many others. I would recommend waiting for the game to be completely finished before even considering in a purchase, assuming it ever will be finished.			"

Early Access Review
								Interesting and challenging free to play coffee break game without the hassle and annoyance of ""buy this"" pop-ups.  Basically plays like tetris with a match 3 twist.  In fact, there are lots more twists then that.  The only part really like tetris is the pieces drop down where one wants them to be placed after rotating the pieces. The match 3 similiarity is 3+ same pieces are required to eliminate those pieces from the gameboard.  Beyond that is where the twists and differences begin.  The first and biggest difference is there is more then one piece to place.  As the game progresses there are more and more different pieces that appear. One new piece per ""level"" achieved.  Also when 3+ matches are made as the match pieces are eliminated the next ""higher"" piece will appear in their place. There will be 7 different modes eventually.  As of Aug 8, 2016 this game is still in early access and not all modes are working.  I will only talk about Abyss and Chaos mode.Abyss mode is a daily game (one game per day).  What makes this game interesting is the fact the pieces and the order of the pieces appear do not ever change.  Before saying BORING, Abyss mode is a scoreboard game.  So if one can remember just exactly what the pieces are and the order they appear in one can potentially gain a higher and higher daily score.  It is basically a memory game. Chaos mode is even more challenging but the potential for incredibly high scores is immense.  In Chaos mode the pieces that appear are randomized.  However, the player gets 4 start-up ""special"" pieces that can be used at will and throughout the gameplay special pieces randomly occur which must be used.  I have not seen all the special pieces yet but some of these special pieces include: addition of a row at the bottom, destruction of all same game pieces (player choice), destruction of a column, one piece only for 4 turns, 3 pieces for 4 turns, 1 random piece added to all columns, etc.  Definitely makes for a challenge.The other modes are or will be:Infinity Mode - It is impossible to ever end.Puzzle Mode - Complete unique puzzle layouts.Pure Mode - No special pieces are able to drop.Versus Mode - Play PVP or COOP with a friend locally.Explore Mode - Go to different FaeVerse worlds and their locations, complete goals, and unlock more.   Recommend to those who like quick little games that have strategy involved, any one who enjoyed Tetris, match 3 enthusiasts, and puzzle solvers.			"

Because you deserve the cash, but also customers deserve a decent price.Early Access is good, but it's a risky move, you need to be able to handle the critics and it can be hard sometime.I hope to see more of your games.

								FaeVerse Alchemy is an interesting idea, but it is no where near completed.As fun as it's been, it's just not worth $15 at the moment. Personally I got the game for free from a friend, so I'm not salty about the price, but there is no way I could recommend buying it at full price.Further, there is no tutorial mode, nothing is explained, there are no hover tips. It's just confusing. There are strange icons and puzzle pieces with no explantion to what the powerups do, etc.Its long term status in Early Access is rather distressing as there have been no updates as long as I've owned the game. In any case, I realize this review is not that thorough, but I needed to leave a review as I've ""finished"" the game, and can't honestly say people should pay $15 for it. Currently it's maybe worth about $5. As the developers say, this game is not finished and you should be willing to play it in its unfinished state.With that in mind, you should not be paying a finished price for an unfinished game. 5/10			"

								A simple, slow paced match 3 game with a dull gimmick (matching introduces new pieces) that's been in early access for over a year but still looks and plays like a proof of concept.Most menu options do nothing. There's a quickplay mode, and an exploration mode where nothing is explained; I can't get past the first stage because I can't get Object1 to equal five...whatever that means.The developer's intentions regarding this game are inscrutable. The price has gone from absurdly high (back when there was next to no information about what it was) to now low enough to trick people into impulse buying. The developer has removed features from this game in order to market them as totally new games, and the game itself is full of vague ads for products that may or may not currently exist.A glance at the official website shows that the developer has a habit of charging absurd prices for unfinished games and misleading bundles. (A visibly broken flash alpha of a Faerie Solitaire sequel is currently going for $47) This game is a scam. Don't buy it.			"

Either way i'll still be playing FaeVerse and i hope they can finish it someday but as of now i just can't recommend it for the full price.EDIT: Recently the game had some nice updates which added a couple of game modes, also the price tag is no longer 15$ and i think the asked price is totally fair so i'm now giving it a thumbs up.

								Okay. This game is pretty, no doubt - Nice music, and easy to play. However, there are a few glaring problems.Keep in mind, it's a W.I.P (the featured screenshots are further along then additional gameplay) And hopefully, when the next update comes out, I'll be able to leave a heartier review. As it stands however, I'm not entirely impressed.As it stands, it's only a Bubble-Pop game - build a collection and try to keep it from overflowing. There's a few puzzle-modes to try, which is a good challenge, but since the one achievement currently active is actually UNachievable, it lacks in positive reinforcement.With no ETA on a substantial update, the previous price (29.99) was unthinkable. I managed to get myself a coupon, which brought it to $3. Since then they've dropped the max price to $15, which is fairer, though still much more then I would pay in it's CURRENT state.It looks like they have some great idea's, and the art is breathtaking, however it has a long way to go IMO, before I can comfortably recommend it.For the price I paid, I rate it 7/10Full price, I would rate it 5/10			"

								Ehhh...simple game, basically match at least three, whether in L shape or I shape, as long as they connect each other; connecting diagonnally doesn't count. Once they match, they then turn into another item which is another new item you need to find a match 3 for, and this new match 3 will turn into another item and so on.Game appears to be still in Early Access according to the store page. There are a few things are that are still greyed out, I guess they're working on that....Right now I'm going for a neutral vote because I didn't like that much nor dislike it that enough to warrant either a solid thumbs up or down, but since steam reviews request I choose either or else I can't post my review(which is lame), then I guess I'm going for a thumbs down because my like meter was slightly towards the negative....===================================Played on Raikou (Gigabyte P35x V3): i74710HQ, 16GB RAM, GTX 980M, 128GB and 1TB SSD mSATA, 2TB HDD, Win 7 Pro x64, BD-R ODD, FHD display			"

								It's similar to both Bejeweled and Tetris, and just as challenging. But what's great is that it has multiple different game modes for you to choose from and provides a different, yet unique feel to the game. A nice and casual game if you're into puzzle games. The only down side, in my opinion, is that it doesn't explain what some of the features do in the game.Definitely worth picking up as it is free - but not if you are not into a bit of a challenge.Note: It's still in early access, and there are still a few other game modes that haven't been released yet, but they do look interesting.

								Despite being incomplete / early access, this is a satisfying Tetris-like match-3 game.The lack of explanations / instructions is a bit frustrating, but once you realize how things work, you get hooked. The sample screenshots show a how to play screen, but I don't actually remember seeing it! The basic game play is simple:You have a hierarchy of alchemical ingredients. Each time you match three or more of them, they disappear and are replaced with a single ingredient one step higher. This new ingredient could trigger other combinations.Like Tetris you are given rotatable pieces to place and you lose if the pieces reach the top of the screen. Unlike Tetris reaction time is not a factor, the pieces don't drop until you click. Also the pieces aren't actually static. If you have three ingredients in an L shape, you could rotate it into a straight line. If you have a four piece square it can be turned into a diamond. Lastly, when the piece is dropped, each ingredient will drop as far as it can, it will not leave empty space.There is a bit more to the game that that, and it has several different game modes, but that is the basics.I find it a lot of fun and tend to completely lose track of time while playing. Now that its free to play, there is no reason not to give it a try!			"

								I decided to edit my review to add a thing or two I missed before after I grinded out all of the achievements for the game.Many people will call this a Bejeweled rip-off, but it's actually more of a Puyo Pop clone, with a slight twist in gameplay mechanics.  In Puyo Pop, you drop different colored blocks into the board, and try to match them up in sets of 4 or more to keep the board from filling up all the way.  In this game, the way it works is that you match like sets of 3, and for each matched set, instead of destroying blocks, they build up into a higher level block.  So, for instance, you match 3 green blocks in a row which spawns a yellow block; if you match 3 of those, you spawn a red block, and so on.  The field does get cleared up to an extent as the 3 or more blocks decrease down to 1, yet the board will never be empty after you've placed your first block.  The main issue I have with the gameplay is that as you progress into higher levels of blocks, you'll still receive low level blocks you have to incorporate and work with.  Admittedly, that's where the challenge and strategy comes in, as well as the potential for chains, as setting off one set could net you the next level of block needed to set off the next one and so forth.  However, once you get to 7 or 8 levels of blocks it becomes incredibly challenging, and there's almost nothing that mitigates this difficulty.  At no point do you remove the lowest level once you reach a certain point (and you'll come to hate getting those low level garbage blocks late game), and because the blocks don't go away in the normal sense there's only so much you can do to stave off the inevitable end of the round.  One factor that turns me off to this game I didn't mention the first time was that there are power-ups, but at no point is there any explanation as to what they are, what they do, or how you get them.  You'll just randomly get a power-up, you'll drop it onto a block, and something will happen.  Over time you might learn what a power-up does, but there are still some that I don't understand what they're supposed to do.  There was a glitch/programming error I noticed with the power-ups as well.  Normally when you get one it shows up at the top of the screen like any other block you're about to drop.  However, at times when I went to drop my normal blocks it would just change into a power-up and activate instead.  I also noticed that some rounds that I played, of the exact same mode, I would be dropping block clusters made up entirely of three pieces instead of the normal two and I have no idea why.  This apparantly is a game the developers gave up on half-way (as evidenced by the achievements and unfinished menu screen), and it shows in these simple programming oddities.I can appreciate that the game goes for a long-term puzzling mindset, instead of a quick reflex Tetris-style puzzle game, but there isn't enough to make me want to keep coming back to this game.  Tetris, Puyo Pop, and Bejeweled all work so well because there's a limit to the number of block types you have to work with, but here it grows beyond what's reasonable for people to manage.  Without anything to mix it up or change what it is I'm doing, and being essentially punished for making progress because I have yet another block type to manage, I have no incentive to keep plugging away.  I can't recommend it, but it's free, so it's worth a quick download and try to see if you like it more than I did.			"

								To start off, I really wanted this game to be good. It looks simple, elegant and addictive.Sadly, looks are deceiving. The degree of random events is simply too high. After several games I still had no clue what the different power-ups did, and there is no description given of what they are supposed to do. This got up to the point where I considered the game to be too random and unplayable. A few tweaks could turn this game into something worth playing.Really not worth the 15 bucks they charge you for it, but I got my copy with a discount coupon (-90%), and I still doubt if it's worth the amount.EDIT:After some help from a dev I got around to exploring different game modes, and it's actually a challenging game in some sense. Curious to see where this game is going in the future.6.5/10, benefit of the doubt.			"

Apart from that, yet another Tetris clone, only without the stressful timer (at least in the mode I played). Several game modes that, again, would have been nice to have explained. This way, you have to google before you can start playing as not everything is self-explanatory.Bear in mind, however, that this is early acccess and that, hopefully, stuff will be added (like the missing tutorial).

								I can't believe this arrogant developer actually thought his game was worth 30 bucks. I got it for 75% off during the sale, and I still feel like I paid too much. It's barely adequate for a match-three game -- not nearly as innovative (or even interesting) as he seems to believe. Oh, well. At least I didn't pay full price. I know it's early access and all, but even with more features, the core of the game will still be mediocre at best. The interface is weak, too -- working with your inventory is far more fiddly than it needed to be. And the inventory items themselves are a great example of brute-force game design with zero finesse. He clearly just invoked every possible interaction he could think of and made only the most minimal, ham-fisted effort to tie them in thematically. Overall, quite an amateurish attempt. Cannot recommend to anyone. Get Puzzle Quest instead. If you already have PQ, play it again -- even the 2nd or 3rd time around, it will still be more rewarding than this silly mess.			"

								I got a 90% off coupon for a crafting reward for another game and I figured that, since I am fond of puzzle games, I'd add another to my library - for three bucks, what's the risk?  The puzzle game in question is, of course, FaeVerse Alchemy.The controls are very simple - one mouse button rotates the patterns, the other button drops the pieces and the mouse slides the arrangement from side to side.  Basically the overall gameplay feels like Dr Mario from the old NES with elements from Tetris thrown in (three symbol patterns).  What's interesting is that as you match alchemical symbols, new symbols get added making the game more difficult than Dr Mario ever was.  All in all, I like the game, I like the music, and I like the whole premise of the game.The only thing I DON'T like?  The $30 price tag slapped on this game.  Okay Subsoap, I get that you are proud of yourselves for making this game.  It's great fun, very stylish and slick looking, and has a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack; BUT THIS IS NOT A $30 DOLLAR GAME!!!  It's a $10 game, tops.  I'll level here, had it not been for the coupon, I never would have bothered with FaeVerse Alchemy due to it's excessive price.  FVA is a good game, but not $30 good.			"

								Have you ever played a Subsoap's free game called ""Faerie Alchemy""?FaeVerse Alchemy is the enhanced edition of Faerie Alchemy, which played at a slower pace with cozy music.If you love Faerie Alchemy, you should buy FaeVerse Alchemy!It is the most excellent 'Match-3' 'Logic' game I've ever played!Don't be afraid of the price, I promise it's worthwhile!

								Great atmospheric tetris-alike game what evolve base idea with elements transformation chain, many game modes - contemplative to competitive.Even  the name of the game shows how deeply and developers approach to every aspect of their brainchild.No surprice hence, artwork, sounds  are naturally woven into the overall concept, so does not detract you from the main process, but caressing glance and mellifluous. Developers of FaeVerse Alchemy took up the implementation of the project with a grand scale. I hope they have the strength and perseverance to develop the project and lead it in the later stages of development and hone all the details.PS: as for the price, you can think of a number of games, expect more support at a significantly lower quality.edit: price has been dropped to ridiculously $3..

								Early Access Review:  Faeverse Alchemy is a puzzle matching game similar to Bejeweled but with a twist, that each new time you make a match, a new block type appears.  Several game modes are available and it appears the developers are still adding new ones.  The gameplay is enjoyable but my major gripe at this point in release is that there are no tooltips or tutorial available to tell you how to use the special blocks that appear, making their use complete guesswork that can make or break your game.  This is a frustrating but perhaps understandable omission at this point in development.  My minor gripe about the game is it's asking price of $30 which seems high for a game that competes with other casual puzzle titles that are sub $10.  The overlay is supported, as is a single steam achievement, making this game ideal for Perfect Game hunters and puzzle enthusiasts alike.  This is definitely a title to keep an eye on.			"

Grab a drink, relax and it easyFaeVerse is a great time killer, but I wouldn't call it a puzzle game despite being so.If anything, its more strategic rather then puzzling, you don't solve any puzzle per se, you just carefully plan where to put your next pieces, as the pieces you're holding will transform into a different one if you make a match of three or more pieces.As the store page tells, the game is on Early Access, so expect the unexpected, like undone levels and such.The gameplay is pretty simple really, using the arrow keys you can shuffle and/or drop the pieces, and the mouse is used for directions (left and right), odd controls yes, yet enjoyable.The music is fairly good, but the game itself becomes a bit repetitive after a while, but its understandable, it is on Early Access after all.The price is bit barbaric, unless you get it on a sales day, but since i got the game for free i can't afford to be picky right?, after all, ""beggars can't be choosers as they say.All and all, a great game to have on your library if you wanna stay away from Horror, FPS and Action games for a while while you catch your breath.I not sure if i can recommend it though, as 86% of the users on Steam are not into this kind of games, but do get it if you love puzzles mix with strategy.

								The game is simple to play, yet hard to master. It's also quite addicting. The devs promise more features, and from the early access view it certainly seems like they've set up plenty of room to expand. People are complaining a bit about the $30 price tag, and I won't argue that it's a bit steep, but the game itself is quite fun and only looks to get better. Devs also promise a demo is coming, so you can decide for yourself if it's worth $30.			"

								Not just a simple ""match 3 or more"" game. Think Tetris meets Bejeweled. Update: puzzle mode has been added and Runepets is now going to be a separate feature. Ghost previews of pieces are in and it helps ( my personal opinion). However, I am noticing that the game will respond very slowly and then kick me out back to the Steam store screen. Not sure what thats about but okay.  The crafting is neat enough but a brief explantion would be greatly appreciated.  That is to say, explain what each piece does. The music has a Far East/Middle Eastern flair to it that is easy on the ears and serves great for background noise.  I realize this is early release, good quality takes time and some devs have other things to do but even a short "" hi everyone, this is where we stand today"" would be nice. I still think you should give FVA a fair shot though.			"

								FaeVerse Alchemy is a new formula-match-3 game created by the folks who brought you Faerie Solitaire.In FaeVerse Alchemy, you are given a 6x7 board in which to process your pieces to the highest level of refinement possible.  To start, you have two pieces - a sun, and a leaf.  Combining three suns merely gives you another leaf, but three leaves yield a new piece - the Loom Eye.  From this point on in your game, the pool of ""dropping"" pieces goes to three, as the newly unlocked Loom Eye drops with the sun and the Leaf.Unlocking more pieces on the board increases the complexity level of the game, your score, and your loot pool.  Yes, loot.  As you play FaeVerse Alchemy, you will loot some of the pieces that you worked so hard to craft.  These pieces that you loot can then be built into items that can be equipped.  As of build 0.0.0.0, these items have no effect in-game.So far, FaeVerse Alchemy looks to have the most complex meta-game of any traditional match-3 puzzle game available, and if the rest of the content is of this same quality, it will be the premiere puzzle game on Steam.
